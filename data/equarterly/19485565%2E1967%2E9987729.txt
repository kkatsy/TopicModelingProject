SELECTION INTENSITY IN THE PAHIRAS

AMITABHA BASU Department of Anthropology

The importance of studying the breeding structure of primitive human populations and the magnitude of the forces of selection, admixture, genetic drift, and so forth acting upon them have recently been emphasized by an international group of experts (WHO,1964).
A similar study on the Pahira, a small, primitive tribe of eastern India with a total population of 1353 individuals, was started in 1963 and has continued since then. Although part of the results obtained in the course of this study has already been published (Basu, 1965, 1966; Basu et al., 1966) and the rest is to be presented shortly in the form of a detailed report, the data on selection intensity has been presented here. The index of total selection intensity, J, and its fertility and mortality components, /; and Im, have been calculated according to Crow (1958).
 The author wishes to thank Dr. S. S. Sarkar of the Department of Anthropology, Calcutta University, for his constant advice and encouragement in carrying out the Pahira study. Thanks are due also to the University Grants Commission, Government of India, for providing financial support to this work.

The Pahiras are divided into three subpopulations, the Northern Pahira, the Southern Pahira I, and the Southern Pahira II. In view of the rarity of intermarriage between the three subpopulations and the statistically significant difference between them in a number of genetic and anthropometric characters (unpublished data of this author), the indices have been calculated separately for each of them.
The data presented in Table 1 show that in all the three Pahira subpopulations Im is higher than Ip a situation also found in 5 out of 10 tribal populations studied by Spuhler (1962) and in 5 out of 6 studied by Salzano (1963, 1964). Further, the index of total selection intensity, I, in the Pahira subpopulations falls more towards the lower limit of the range (0.6-3.7) found among 10 tribal populations studied by Spuhler (1962), indicating thereby that selection is acting with only a moderate intensity in the Pahira subpopulations. An interesting point to note in this context is that / increases gradually from the
