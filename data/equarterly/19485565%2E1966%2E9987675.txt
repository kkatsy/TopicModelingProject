NEW ACHIEVEMENTS OF SOVIET GENETICS

Novosti Press Agency (APN) Moscow, USSR

The latest achievements of Soviet genetics are being demonstrated at the exhibition, "Genetic Basis of Selection of Plants and Animals." This exhibition was arranged by the USSR Academy of Sciences in Moscow. Among the exhibits are materials on the genetic principles for breeding "color mink." The stand showing "pearl mink" developed by Soviet fur animal breeders-geneticists is of special interest. Pearl mink is an animal with a skin of a smoky-beige color and a bluish shade. The large expenditure entailed on these experiments was fully repaid at international fur auctions

where furs developed in the USSR such as blue, pearl, white, and beige mink were priced much higher than those of "standard" dark brown mink. "Color mink" has a smaller propagation than dark brown mink. In order to increase the offspring of "color mink," the Institute of Genetics of the Siberian Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences elaborated a method for giving daily ray treatment to these minks in the course of two and a half hours in the evening and at night. As a result the propagation of mink increased by 20%.
