XROM 1946 TO 1952 the annual number oí births in the United States varied between 3,400,000 and 3,900,000, compared with previous records of 3,100,000 in 1943 and 3,050,000 in 1921. A new high mark of nearly 4,000,000 has just been set in 1953, which is nearly 75 per cent above the figure for 1933 -- twenty years earlier. During the last eight years the crude birth rate has been between 24 and 27 per 1,000, compared with between 18.4 and 22.7 during 1928 to 1945. No such great upsurge in fertility has occurred previously in the United States.
This postwar "baby boom" soon led many people to think not only that there had been a rise in the current fertility of American women, but also that an increase in the average size of their completed families had begun.1 By now it is commonly believed that the longtime downward trend in average size of family, which started at least as far back as the early 1800's, was reversed a few years ago. In consequence, the number of births in future years is expected to be larger than the number in recent years. On the other hand, at least one demographer expressed the opinion as late as a year ago that in spite of the recent "baby boom" the average number of births per completed family had not stopped decreasing, and that the shifts which had occurred in the timing of births would inevitably bring within five or ten years a reduction in numbers of births amounting to ten per cent or more.
1"Average size of completed families" is used here (somewhat loosely) as equivalent to "average number of live births per woman living to the end of the childbearing period."

Usually when there are such seemingly
contradictory opinions about the direction
of change, one or the other is wrong, or
else both are wrong because no change is
taking place. Is this true here, or is it pos-
sible that the average size of families is in-
creasing and decreasing at the same time?
This question will be discussed in Sections
I and II. Finally, in Section III the out-
look for changes in annual fertility during
future years will be considered briefly.
During recent years the measurement of
fertility trends in the United States has
been assisted materially by the preparation
of cohort fertility tables which trace the
birth performance through the childbear-
ing period of the women born in different
years. These tables provide most of the statistical basis for this article.2 They are
available as yet for native white women
only, which means that most of the follow-
ing discussion will relate specifically to
these women. Nevertheless, the conclusions
should be fairly applicable to all white
2These tables in summary and detailed form will be contained in the writer's monograph, Cohort Fertility: Native White Woman in the United States, which is scheduled for publication in February, 1954, by the Princeton University Press. The summary tables in this article are based on the detailed tables in the monograph. They differ from the summary tables in the monograph because data for 1949 and 1950 could be used in their preparation, which permitted reference to five-year time periods consisting of 1945-49, 1940-44, etc. instead of 1944-48, 1939-43, etc., and to the situation on January I, 1951. The same grouping of cohorts (1875-79, 1880-84, etc.) is used in all cases. This means that cumulative birth rates of cohorts are shown up to exact ages 15-19, 20-24, etc. in the text and summary tables of the monograph, but up to exact ages 16-20, 21-25, etc., or 17-21, 22-26, etc., in this paper. In both cases years and cohorts are grouped by fives in order to condense the discussion.

reached at the beginning of 1920, and to show current and cumulative rates by single years of age only from 1920 to the end of the childbearing period, and (b) to omit entirely the cohorts of 1874 and earlier years. The discussion here is influenced accordingly.

That the downward trend will be reversed among later cohorts can be predicted with a high degree of assurance. It is now known that in the cohorts of 1910-- 14 there were 2,200 births per 1,000 women by ages 37-41 (i.e., by January 1,1951) compared with 2,188 for the cohorts of 1905-09

That there has been a large decrease during the last 30 years in the average number of births per native white woman living to the end of the childbearing period is shown clearly by the cohort fertility tables. Among the women in the cohorts of 1875-79 who lived to age 47,3 there were 3,497 births per 1,000 women. (See Table 1.) In contrast, the final cumulative birth rate for the cohorts of 1900-04 is 2,483, a drop of almost 30 per cent. Moreover, it is fairly certain that the decline was not interrupted among the cohorts of 1875 to 1904.
The women in the cohorts of 1905-09 were 42-46 years old at the end of 1950 (the latest year for which tabulations are available for births by order of birth to women in different cohorts), hence, there is very little likelihood of their bearing

1951 (i.e., 37 to 41) than did the 1909 cohort, with a tendency for the differences to be larger for the later cohorts. Unless the women in the cohorts of 1910 to 1914 bear at least 15 per cent fewer children after ages 37 to 41 than those in the 1909 cohort, which could happen but now appears quite unlikely, the 1909 group will have the dubious distinction of having been the least fertile, and the 1910 group can claim to have started an upward trend. On this basis, the year by which the longtime decrease in the average size of completed families will have been reversed can be determined by adding to 1909 the age at which women reach the end of the childbearing period. If this age is taken as 47, the trend will have been reversed by 1956; if 45 is used, the turn will occur in this year -- in 1954.

3In computing the basic tables it was assumed that no births occurred after a woman's 47th birthday. The very small number of births at later ages according to the registration records were arbitrarily classified as occurring during age 46.

A glance at the cumulative birth rates by order of birth, and at the distribution by parity (number of children ever borne) of the women in different cohorts who live to

the end of the childbearing period, confirms the truth of the general belief that the decline in average family size has come about in important degree through a decrease in the proportion of large families. As shown in Table 1, the final cumulative birth rate was 3,497 for the 1875-79 cohorts and 2,483 for the 1900-04 group, a decrease of 1.014. Slightly over one-fifth of this occurred among eighth and higher order births (from 361 to 133) and nearly as

those of 1900-04. (See Table 2.) The largest increase occurred in one-child families (from 12.5 to 18.1 per cent), with two-child families in second place (from 15.0 to 20.3 per cent). Three- and four-child families were relatively stable, the former rising slightly from 12.5 to 13.9 per cent of this total, and the latter declining from 10.2 to 8.7. Successively larger decreases occurred for women bearing larger numbers of children. Those with five or six were only two-

much for sixth and seventh births (from 403 to 183). The largest reduction for a single birth order is that of 157 for fourth births, closely followed by 143 and 142 for third and fifth births, respectively. For first births the decline was only 34. The relative size of the reductions rises sharply from four per cent for first births to 63.2 per cent for eighth and higher order births. (See Fig. 1.)
The final distribution by parity of the women in a cohort can be obtained from the differences between the final first birth rate and unity, and between final rates for successive pairs of first and higher order births. The proportion of childless women rose slightly, from about 19.3 per cent in the cohorts of 1875-79 to 22.7 per cent in

thirds as numerous (relatively) among the 1900-04 cohorts as among those of 1875-79, and those who had borne seven or more were less than half as numerous. Large families will be still less common among the 1905-09 than among the 1900-04 cohorts and two-child families more common. Little change will occur in the proportion with no child, or with one or three. (See Fig. 2.)
II. How Much Will the Average Size of Completed Families Change in the Future?
As shown in Section I, it is practically certain that average family size will be larger for the cohorts of 1910-14 than 1905-09, and still larger for the 1915-19 group. But will an upward trend continue

among subsequent cohorts or will the former downward trend be resumed? And in any case, how large are the changes in family size likely to be? In trying to answer these questions, let us first examine some of the relevant facts which are available from the cohort tables.
It is known that the cumulative birth rate of the 1930-34 cohorts by ages 17-21, the 1925-29 cohorts by ages 22-26, the 1920-24 cohorts by ages 27-31, and the 1915-19 cohorts by ages 32-36,4 are substantially larger than the rates of the 1910-- 14 group by the same ages. It is also known that the trend from cohort to cohort has been definitely upward during the last 15 years. These facts may be interpreted as pointing to an increase in average size of completed families at least from the cohorts of 1905-09 to 1930-34, or from about 1956 to 1981. Before accepting this interpretation or trying to estimate the extent of the increase, it is desirable to consider the cumulative rates for different birth orders.
·The first comparison is that between the cohorts of 1910-14 and 1915-19, based on the rates up to ages 32-36. Those of the later group were larger by 8.0 per cent for first births, 14.6 per cent for second, 15.0 per cent for third, and 6.7 per cent for fourth, but were smaller by 2.4 per cent
4These ages were reached by these cohorts at the end of 1950, the latest year for which the numbers of births are available as yet by age of mother by order of birth of child.

for fifth, 9.9 per cent for sixth and seventh, and 12.5 per cent for eighth and higher orders. (See Table 3, and Table 4 line a.) If these ratios were to apply at the end of the childbearing period, the average size of completed family would be 8.3 per cent larger for the later than the earlier group (see line e), and not 9.4. per cent as indicated by comparing the rates for all births by ages 32-36 (see line a). It is practically certain, however, that the ratios for first and second births will be appreciably smaller by age 47 than they were by ages 32-36. The latter would give the 1915-19 cohorts final rates of 872 for first births and 739 for second, which are far above those for cohorts as far back as 1875-79. (Compare line c of Table 4 and the line for the 1875-79 cohorts in Table 1.) On the other hand, it is possible that the ratios for sixth and later births will be somewhat larger by age 47 than they were by ages 32-36, although a decrease seems more likely in view of past trends for rates of these birth orders. Ratios for third, fourth, and fifth are likely to remain about as they were. Opinions will differ, of course, as to the size of all such changes, the direction of some, and the net influence on the average size of completed families. The writer thinks that the 1915-19 cohorts are almost certain to have more children than those of 1910-- 14, but that the increase will not exceed seven per cent.

of the cohorts of 1920-24 and 1910-14 on the basis of their cumulative rates up to ages 27-31 (reached by the later cohorts on January 1, 1951) soon runs into difficulties. Thus, thecumulative rates bythese ages for the 1920-24 group exceed thoseof the earlier group by 24.7 percent forfirst births and 41.1 per cent for second. (See Table 3, Table 4 and Fig. 3) Applying these percentages to the "medium" esti-

mates of final rates of the 1910-14 cohorts (800 for first births and 632 for second) gives corresponding estimates for the 192024 group of 1,006 for first births and 910 for second. For1,000 women to have 1,006 first births is obviously impossible. Since some women do not marry, some married couples cannot have any children, and others cannot have more than one, a first birth rate of 880 or a second birth rate of

It is quite possible, of course, that the relatively large rates for first and second births to the 1920-24 women by ages 27-31 reflect a tendency to start families younger in greater degree than was assumed in making the high estimates. The writer believes that reasonable "low" estimates for final first and second birth rates are 818 and 662, respectively. Making corresponding allowances for other birth orders gives 2,362 as the "low" estimate for the final rate for all births. This would be a gain of about one per cent over the comparable rate for the 1910-14 cohorts, but a decline of one per cent from that of the 1915-19 group.8
The larger cumulative rate by ages 22-

the per cent married rising from 10.9 to 16.5 at ages 15-19, from 51.5 to 67.5 at ages 20-24, and from 76.8 to 86.8 at ages 25-29. Not all of the increase in cumulative first birth rates can be attributed to younger marriage, however. For example, the proportion of the women aged 20-24 who were married rose 31 per cent from 1940 to 1950, but the proportion of the women aged 2125 who had borne a child rose 40 per cent from 1941 to 1951. Similarly, among women aged 25-29 the proportion married was 13 per cent larger in 1950 than in 1940, but the proportion with one or more children a year later was up 26 per cent -- nearly twice as much.6

these years. The 1940 data give 21.7 as the median age at first marriage for white women, and the 1950 data 20.2. If the 47th birthday is taken as the end of the childbearing period, this indicates that the period has been lengthened from 25.3 to 26.8 years, an increase of 5.9 per cent. It may be suggested, of course, that the proportions of women married at the younger ages may increase during the 1950's and 1960's as they did during the 1940's. This would lift the per cent married at ages 1519 from 16.5 in 1950 to 22.1 in 1960 and
27.7 in 1970 (both are quite possible), and the per cent married at ages 20-24 from 67.5 to 83.5 and 99.5 (the latter is practically impossible). The per cent married at ages 25-29, which rose from 76.8 in 1940 to
86.8 in 1950, would reach an upper limit in the late 1950's or early 1960's. It is highly unlikely, therefore, that earlier marriage will lengthen the average interval from marriage to the end of the childbearing period by as much as 15 per cent.
The foregoing procedure undoubtedly understates the influence which younger marriage would have on fertility in the absence of other changes, because it makes no allowance for the higher fecundity of women in the early than in the later portions of the childbearing period. It should be remembered, however, that fecundity diminishes during this period not only because of aging or other variations associated merely with time, but also because of complications connected with the first, the second, or a subsequent pregnancy. Unfortunately, so little information is available on these matters that there is little basis for trying to evaluate them quantitatively.
A second reason which is advanced for believing that marrying younger will lead to substantially larger families is based on results from many studies of fertility differentials between geographic, economic, and social groups. These show a high inverse relation between the age of marriage and the fertility of the groups investigated. Unfortunately, little evidence has been col-

lected as to the extent and effectiveness of family planning in such groups. It may well be that differences in this variable rather than differences in age at marriage are responsible for most of the fertility differentials in question.
While younger marriage in itself, no doubt, will tend to cause increases in size of completed family, there will be influences working in the opposite direction. Among these are the more general diffusion of information regarding the better methods of planning family size which are now available, and the development of still more effective methods. Indirect evidence points conclusively to the fact that an important proportion of couples have had larger families than they wanted in past decades, but that this proportion has been decreasing over time. Among the native white Protestant couples included in the Indianapolis study, approximately 80 per cent had no more children than they wanted and 20 per cent an excess number.7 The proportion of couples who were successful planners in 1941 undoubtedly was substantially higher in this Indianapolis group than in the entire United States. Now it almost certainly is larger in both groups than it was in 1941; it can increase appreciably in the future.
The crucial question with respect to future trends in size of completed family, therefore, is: What changes will take place in the number of children wanted? Opinions on this subject differ widely and cannot be adequately supported with facts. The study in Indianapolis is one of the few in which statistical information was gath-

ered. The average number of children wanted by the 1,977 couples included was 2.2, but whether this is smaller or larger than the corresponding number for similar couples in earlier or later years, is not known. More is known about changes in opinions as to the "ideal" number of children per family, thanks to national polls by the American Institute of Public Opinion in 1941 and 1945. Averaging the replies of women aged 21-34 gave 3.0 children as the "ideal" in 1941 and 3.3 in 1945. The only later survey of a similar nature known to the writer relates to a sample of ever married Detroit women 40 years of age or older who were interviewed in 1952.8 Averaging their replies gives 3.3 as the "ideal," which is practically the same as the national figure for 1945. Since it would be expected that women in a large city like Detroit would tend to favor smaller families than those in smaller cities, in suburban areas, and on farms, it is probable that a national poll in 1954 would elicit a larger "ideal" than that of 1945.
In comparing the foregoing "ideals" with the number of children borne per 1,000 women in actual cohorts, it must be remembered that the "ideals" make no allowance for women who remain single, nor for couples who cannot have a child.9 It should also be remembered that "ideals" tend to exceed performance. Thus, the Detroit women whose replies gave 3.3 children as the "ideal" number had had only 2.6 themselves.
The forecasts of future fertility presented by the writer in the monograph mentioned above are based on three sets of assumptions made two years ago as to what will follow the reversal of the downward trend of the final cumulative birth rate. The high assumption is that there will be an

upward trend which will lead to a rate of 2,800 for the cohorts of 1945^9, a gain of about 500 (or 22 per cent) from the low mark of about 2,300 which will shortly be set by the 1909 women. At the other extreme, the low assumption is that the rise will be of short duration, will reach a peak of about 2,400 for the cohorts of 1915-19, and will be followed by a decline which will reduce the rate to 2,000 for the cohorts of 1945-49 and later years. The medium assumption is for a rise to about 2,550 for the cohorts of 1920-24, and then a gradual decrease to 2,400 for the cohorts of 1945-- 49 and later. Space does not permit a discussion of the relation between these assumptions and the past trends of the cumulative rates of actual cohorts or the poll information as to "ideal" number of children.10 The writer can merely repeat his belief that the actual rates will lie within the high and low extremes, and more likely above than below the medium series.
III. Implications for Annual Fertility Rates
This section will be devoted to the trends in annual birth rates up to 1965 which would occur if the changes in average size of completed family should follow the high, medium, or low assumptions discussed above.
If, in accordance with the high fertility assumption, the final cumulative rate for all births rises from about 2,300 for the women in cohort of 1909 (by January 1, 1956) to 2,800 for those in the cohorts of 1945-49 (who will start bearing children in the early 1960's), can it be taken for granted that the annual rate for all births will rise also? A partial answer to this question may be obtained by examining the data in Table 5. Line h of this table shows the final cumulative birth rates for a hypothetical group of cohorts living through the childbearing period under the

IThe procedure here is similar to that used in computing the conventional gross reproduction rate. The rates on line a are the cumulative rates of the 1930-34 cohorts by January 1, 1950. Those on line b are the additions to the cumulative rates of the 1925-29 cohorts from January 1, 1945 to January 1, 1950, etc.

Putting together the birth rates of successive cohorts at successive ages during 1945-49 and 1950-54 gives hypothetical final cumulative birth rates of 2,940 and 3,240, respectively. Both of these figures exceed the "high" assumption of 2,800 for

which could not continue for many years. That they occurred at all was due partly to the making up in these periods of first births postponed during World War II (and perhaps even earlier), and in greater degree to the starting of families then, rather than later, by the hundreds of thousands of couples who married at younger ages than was customary with pre-war marriage patterns.
Rates for second births during 1945-49 and 1950-54 were improbably, rather than impossibly, high from a longtime stand-

point. The numbers of these births during the two periods also were swelled by the bearing of the second babies postponed from prior years, and those advanced from later years as a result of more marriages at younger ages. Due to the time which elapses between marriage and the first birth, and between successive births, the tendency to marry younger did not affect third birth rates appreciably until the current period, and will not affect fourth and higher order births until later.
Looking ahead to 1955-59 and 1960-64 it is certain that even if the average size of completed families increases in accordance with the high assumptions, first birth rates will be substantially lower than during 1950-54, continuing the decline which went on from 1945-49 to 1950-54. Rates for second births also will decrease, in this case from the high mark of 1950-54. Third birth rates may continue to be large for another five-year period, but are certain to be smaller in 1960-64. With these births, therefore, the question is not whether the rates will rise or fall but whether the reduction will be small (as in the high assumptions) or considerably larger. Increases may occur with higher order births, however. The high assumptions raise the rates for fourth, sixth and seventh births during 1955-59 and 1960-64 slightly above the 1950-54 figures; for fifth births the upswing is substantially larger. Rates for eighth and subsequent births are shown as slightly higher during 1955-59 than 1950-54, but as declining thereafter.
The rates for all births according to the high assumptions are 3,151 for 1955-59 and 2,987 for 1960-64; they represent decreases of 2.7 and 7.8 per cent, respectively, from the rate of 3,240 for 1950-54. Since the high assumptions allow not only for an increase of nearly 20 per cent in size of completed families from the cohorts of 1905-09 to those of 1945-49, but also for substantial increases in the proportion of women who marry and start childbearing at the younger ages, it seems quite unlikely

to the writer that the actual birth rates during 1955-59 and 1960-64 will exceed those in the high series. In other words, a decline in annual fertility rates, starting within two or three years and lasting about ten years, can be expected with a high degree of certainty. It may be small in accordance with the high assumptions outlined above, but it may also be large in accordance with the low assumptions to be discussed next.
The low fertility assumptions are based on a minor reversal of the past downward trend of final fertility rates (a rise from 2,325 for the cohorts of 1905-09 to 2,393 for those of 1915-19), and then a slow decrease to 2,000 for the cohorts of 1945-49. In addition, they allow for a reversal of the trend toward younger marriage and childbearing, and a return to the patterns of the early 1940's and the 1920's, but not those of the depression years of the 1930's. Such a trend could begin easily if the economic situation should worsen substantially and there should be corresponding changes in other factors influencing age at marriage. Under these conditions there would be a large scale postponement of marriage, and of the starting of families by married couples or the adding of children to the families already begun. Even with a much less severe depression than that of the 1930's, there would be reasons for expecting larger reductions in annual fertility from 1950-54 to 1955-59 than those which took place from 1925-29 to 1930-34. The most important reason is that the tendency to marry and start families younger has been several times greater during the last ten years than during the 1920's; hence, there has been a correspondingly greater advancement of births from 1954 or later to 1953 or earlier than there was from the 1930's to the 1920's.
The meaning of the low assumptions in terms of annual fertility during coming years may be seen by utilizing the same procedure as for the high assumptions, namely, combining the estimated rates for successive actual cohorts at successive ages.

corresponding rate of 3,240 for 1950-54.

Substantial differences are found between the low and high assumptions for births of each order, with a tendency for them to become somewhat larger relatively at the higher birth orders. The differences for the lower order births reflect primarily the assumptions regarding the timing of births -- the continuation of the recent tendency toward childbearing at younger ages in the high assumptions, and the reversal of this tendency in the low. The differences for the middle and higher order births reflect in increasing degree the assumptions regarding changes in final fertility rates. The reason is that the rise of the final rate to 2,800 for all births to the cohorts of 1945-49 in the high assumptions is based on the following changes from the cohorts of 1905-09: a relatively small increase (9 per cent) for first births, successively larger increases for second, third, and fourth births (reaching 40 per cent for the latter), smaller increases for sixth and seventh births, and a decrease of 29 per cent for eighth and subsequent births combined. In contrast, the rate of 2,000 for all births to the 1945-49 cohorts in the low assumptions is based on very slight decreases (one per cent) from the first and second birth rates of the 1905-09 cohorts and successively larger reductions at subsequent birth orders (amounting to about 85 per cent for eighth and later births combined).
The medium assumptions are midway between the high and the low. They are based on (a) an increase in the final fertility rate from 2,337 for the cohorts of 1905-09 to about 2,550 for those of 192529, and then a gradual decrease to 2,400 for the 1945-49 group, and (b) a slight decrease from the present record-breaking,

In January, 1954, with many saying that an economic "readjustment" is underway but that there will not be a real depression in the near future, it seems unlikely that fertility rates will be close to the low assumptions during the next five or ten years, and probable that they will be above the medium. Nevertheless, it is well to remember that when family planning is as widespread and effective as it now is, annual fertility can change rapidly. The writer has not heard of anyone seriously interested in population questions who wrote between 1935 and 1945 that the 1946-54 period probably would see the high fertility rates and large numbers of births which have occurred. On the contrary, as J. S. Davis has emphasized, users of the population forecasts which the writer helped to prepare during 1930-1943 clearly preferred the medium or even the low fertility assumptions to those of high fertility, although the latter were substantially below the actual fertility of 1945-54. Because it still is so easy to be unduly influenced by the recent situation when thinking of what may happen in the future, the writer feels strongly that too little consideration is being given to the possibility that a major, rather than a minor, downward shift in annual fertility rates will occur within a few years.
Will the decrease in annual birth rates during the next ten years (or thereabouts) bring a reduction in annual numbers of births, or will it be more than balanced by population growth? In this connection it should be remembered that, although the total number of persons has been increasing rapidly during recent years, the number of women at some of the childbearing

15

ages not only has been decreasing but will continue to decrease for a time, because of the substantial decline in the annual number of births that went on from 1921 to 1933. As a consequence of that change there will be a somewhat larger reduction from 1950-54 to 1955-59 for the annual number of births than for the annual birth rate. In contrast, the increase in the number of births after 1933 will soon have a greater influence than the previous decrease, and will tend to raise rather than lower the number of births from 1955-59 to 1960-64. In consequence, the low assumptions show a smaller decrease between these two periods for the number of births than for the annual birth rate, and the high assumptions show a slight increase in the number of births in spite of the decrease in rates.
The foregoing discussion relates to changes in the fertility of native white women. As mentioned earlier it should apply to the changes for all women fairly well because such a large proportion of them are native white. Allowances are needed, however, for the influence of the more widespread and effective control of fertility by native white women than by others during past and future years. One consequence of this differential is that the changes in the timing of births have been, and for some years will continue to be, relatively larger among native white women than others. Another is that the downward trend in average size of completed

family is not likely to stop at as early a date for other women as for native white women. A third is that there may not be a subsequent increase in average family size for other women, and if one does occur it almost certainly will be smaller than that for the native white group. Finally, since native white women have tended to marry at slightly older ages than other women, the recent tendency to marry younger very probably has been less important for the other women, and has caused less advancing of births from 1954 or later to 1953 or earlier. This will tend to support the annual fertility rates and numbers of births of foreign-born white and colored women in slightly greater degree than those of native white women during the next decade.
Statements about probable fertility trends after 1965 are necessarily more speculative than those for intervening years. All that will be said here is that both the low and high assumptions show higher rates for 1965-69 than 1960-64. This occurs with the high assumptions because they are predicated on an upward trend in average size of family, some continuation of the tendency to marry younger, and no depression or other change which will cause births to be postponed. It occurs with the low assumptions, in spite of the decline in family size, because of the making up of the births which in this series are shown as postponed during 1955-64.
