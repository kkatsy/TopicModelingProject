A NOTE ON OSBORN'S "EXCESS AND UNWANTED FERTILITY"

Osborn (1963) has presented some careful calculations about what would happen in the United States if unwanted conceptions were eliminated. This correspondent is deeply interested in this topic (Pohlman, 1965a; 1965b) and welcomes any possibility that precise conception might eliminate both unwanted conceptions and some of our excess population growth at one stroke. However, this communication calls attention to a relatively minor and understandable oversight in Osborn's article.
Osborn (1963, p. 63) appropriately cites the following definition of "excess fertility" from Freedman, Whelpton, and Campbell (1959, p. 78): "The couple's most recent pregnancy was unwanted then or later by the husband, the wife, or both." However, he then appears to refer to these as "unwanted births" (Osborn, 1963, p. 64) and to assume that adequate contraception might eliminate them all (pp. 67, 68).
The proportion of cases classified as "excess fertility" even though one parent wanted the conception was not stated by Freedman, et al. (1959). Hence Osborn's oversight was easy to make. However, the preliminary draft of the report of the second "Growth of American Families" (Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson, 1965, Chap. 5) is more specific on this point. Of all couples, 17% are classified as having "excess fertility." For about 50% of these, however, one spouse

wanted the last conception and the other did not (pp. 5-14). Among two-thirds of these disagreeing couples, it was the husband who wanted the youngster and the wife who did not. One might speculate that similar proportions of the earlier sample (Freedman, et al., 1959) showed disagreement.
When a husband and wife disagreeas to whether a child is wanted, even perfect contraception may not eliminate a birth, unless, of course, contraception is practiced dictatorially by the one who does not want the conception. Studies like those of Rainwater (1960; 1965) and Hill, Stycos, and Back (1959) suggest that when marriage partners are not united in intent, conception often occurs, and that family cooperation is important. These are matters that go beyond contraceptive precision.
It appears that Osborn (1963) overestimated the extent to which perfect contraception would reduce population growth in the United States, although this correspondent would not attempt to calculate the extent of such overestimation.
Osborn has suggested, in personal correspondence, that when couples are asked several years later whether the conception was wanted, there must be a tendency to minimize its unwanted status. Thus any estimates of the percentage of unwanted conceptions may be underestimated, and this should tend toward balancing the

impact of the present comment. Osborn's point is well taken.
