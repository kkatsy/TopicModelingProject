DELETERIOUS MUTATIONS IN MAN*

T-HE MECHANISM of sexual reproduction
aXnHd cross-fertilization creates the possibility for any population to accumulate a large number of recessive deleterious mutations. The incidence of these detrimental genetic variants in Mendelian populations will depend, however, upon a variety of factors among which are the population size, inbreeding coefficient, selection pressures, mutation rates, etc.
For practical purposes, deleterious genes may be roughly classified into two overlapping categories, namely, abnormals (visibles) and lethals plus semilethals. In man, direct (for the first category) and semi-direct and indirect methods (for both of them) have been employed in recent years to estimate the mean number of deleterious mutations carried by each person. It is the purpose of this paper to review and discuss the present status of our knowledge in this area.

INDIRECT PROCEDURE
The first approach to the problem, based mainly on Drosophila data extrapolated to man, leads to 8 as the number of "slightly dominant, detrimental mutant genes in heterozygous condition" (Muller, 1950). Some years late, based on the same indirect approach, Muller (1956) calculated at 6.5 the minimal figure "for the content of recessive, definitely detrimental mutations (including lethals), per individual human being."
DIRECT METHOD
The only direct analysis of the problem has been made by Stevenson (1959). Based on an extensive collection of data on the frequencies of genetically determined defects in Northern Ireland, Stevenson arrived at 0.52 recessives and 0.06 dominants per person. These estimates did not include sex-linked genes. Some 30 traits whose genetic mechanisms are not well known were also not taken into consideration. Even assuming that some of the latter may be due to one recessive gene mutation, "it is difficult to

account for more than one harmful mutant per person" (Stevenson, 1959).
SEMI-DIRECT APPROACHES
The first author to use a semi-direct approach, based on the data of consanguineous marriages obtained by Arner (1908), was Muller (1948). With a method whose details were not specified it was concluded that "every person on the average contains heterozygously at least one lethal gene or group of genes which (homozygously would) . . . kill an individual . . . between birth and maturity." The figure actually found was around 2.
A semi-direct method based on a suggestion by Reed (1954) was devised by Slatis (1954) and used to estimate the mean number of deleterious mutations in heterozygous condition in the ancestors common to the parents of the children under study. Slatis' data were highly biased in the direction of an increase in frequency of the genetic ailments, and he was aware of this distortion. Anyway, with his material, it was found "that the average person is heterozygous for eight abnormal genes."
Morton, Crow and Muller (1956) developed the concept of lethal equivalents and applied it to data from Bemiss (1858), Arner (1908), and Sutter and Tabah (1952). Lethal equivalents are defined as a group of deleterious genes in which a full lethal gene (with 100% penetrance) equals two semi-lethals with 50% penetrance, three semi-lethals with 33.3% penetrance, etc. Different causes of death, environmental or genetic, are assumed to be nonsynergistic. Using the French and American data, it was found that "the average person carries heterozygously the equivalent of 3-5 recessive lethals acting between late fetal and early adult stages" (mortality has been used from stillbirths up to the age

of 20 years). The French data also suggested that "the average person carries about 4-5 genes which, if homozygous, could cause conspicuous abnormality." For lethals, Morton et al.'s method is based on the regression of the natural logarithm of the frequency of survivors on the coefficient of inbreeding. The regression coefficient so obtained (B) is the mean number of lethal equivalents per gamete (2B is the corresponding number per person). Schull (1958, 1959) verified that the regression coefficient obtained by fitting a weighted linear regression of the frequency of deaths on the inbreeding coefficients does not differ appreciably from the value of B estimated according to the laborious method of Morton et al. A new approach to the estimate of B has been suggested by Kimura (1958a, b). It has been called an "inverse approach" in the sense that the various degrees of inbreeding found in a sample of "affected" individuals are compared with those found in a sample of "normal" individuals. Regarding neonatal deaths, for instance, the method consists in comparing the distribution of the inbreeding coefficients detected in a sample of neonatal deaths with those found in a sample of normal births.
Book (1957) and Penrose (1957) devised new methods which when applied to Book's data from Sweden lead to "a minimum of three detrimental autosomal recessive genes in the heterozygous condition per individual" (Book) and 2.94 "deleterious genes at different loci" (Penrose). Calculations by these authors included, however, only clear-cut abnormalities.
Slatis, Reis and Hoene (1958) developed the concept of abnormal equivalents (with the same genetic meaning as lethal equivalents) and defined detri-

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:25 08 December 2015

mental equivalents as the sum of lethal equivalents plus abnormal equivalents. In the same paper, Slatis et al. introduced a correction to Penrose's method and made possible its use in mortality data when control information is available. With this correction, the number of abnormal genes per person in Book's material is found to be 5.88 (twice the value of 2.94 found by Penrose). With data collected in the Chicago region, Slatis et al. arrived at 2.46 lethal equivalents and 2.03 abnormal equivalents, or 4.49 detrimental equivalents.
The expression "detrimental equivalents," introduced by Slatis, Reis and Hoene, in 1958, has been used by Chung, Robison and Morton (1959) to define a different concept. For these authors, the mean number of detrimental equivalents is the mean number of genes which, if made homozygous, would cause a specific detrimental trait. They applied this concept to deaf-mutism and concluded that, on the basis of data obtained by Stevenson and Cheeseman (1956) in Northern Ireland, "the average number of recessive genes for deafmutism per individual is 0.160+0.024." In order to avoid ambiguities, the sum of lethal equivalents plus abnormal equivalents will be called deleterious equivalents in this paper.
A reanalysis of Book's data by Slatis' (1954) method leads to 5.32 as the number of "detrimental mutant genes per person" (Slatis et al, 1958). We applied the Penrose-Slatis method to Sutter's (1958) data and found, in the three French "ddpartements" studied, 2-4 lethal equivalents (excluding abortions and miscarriages) and 2-5 abnormal equivalents, a total of 4-9 deleterious equivalents. The same method has been applied to Slatis' (1954) biased data, and 7 abnormals were found.

195
With data obtained in three Japanese cities and using a variant of Morton et al.'s method, Schull (1958) arrived at 0.17, 0.20 and 0.22 abnormal equivalents per person. He also found 0.74, 0.09 and 0.18 in "early deaths" (stillbirths plus mortality within the first month of life); 0.79 and 0.29 in deaths in 9 months; and 2.15 in data on deaths in 8 years. The total for one of the cities (Hiroshima) is 2.46 (data of malformations, stillbirths and deaths in 8 years); for the second (Kure) it is 0.29 (malformations plus early deaths); and for the third (Nagasaki) it is 0.47 (malformations, stillbirths and deaths in 9 months). The most complete information (where data on abortions, miscarriages, and mortality from 8 years up to the mean marriage age were lacking, however) suggests that the mean number of lethal equivalents carried by each person must be around 3 or even higher. The three series of data show that the mean number of abnormal equivalents (measured with data on "major congenital abnormalities") is around 0.20. If one makes allowance for the minor defects and for genetic diseases developing after birth, this number could rise to 1.0 or higher. Schull's data may be thus accepted as suggestive of values around 3 for lethal equivalents and around 1 for abnormal equivalents, with a total of deleterious equivalents of about 4.
Among 9,526 pregnancy terminations in recent times in Belfast, Stevenson, Dudgeon and McClure (1959) found 46 from consanguineous marriages. Using their data from first cousins, first cousins once removed and second cousins (the only ones whose degrees of relationship are given in their paper), one finds a mean number of lethal equivalents acting during the pregnancy equal to 4-5. Stevenson et al.'s data are biased in the

direction of an excess of inbreeding effect (see page 405 of the above-mentioned paper and page 387 of the first paper of the series). The value actually found (4.6) must be so accepted as an overestimate.
Zerbin-Rudin (1960) investigated the offspring of 299 Roman Catholic consanguineous couples (287 first-cousin and 12 uncle-niece marriages) in the German Diocese of Miinschen. As no control sample was obtained, comparisons have been made with available information for the Bavarian population. With a series of assumptions regarding the genetic nature of the anomalies found, and the part played by recessive genes in stillbirths and mortality from birth up to the age of 5, it was concluded that the number of abnormal recessive genes per person equals 3.19 and that of lethals equals 2.15. As Zerbin-Rudin used Penrose's (1957) formula, these figures must be doubled; so the values are 6.38 and 4.30, giving a total of 10.68. These figures must be accepted, however, with great caution due to the number of assumptions involved in their calculations.
In a recent paper, Morton (1960) estimated the values of B from the abnormality data in the French, Swedish and American material already referred to. These data revealed about 3 abnormal equivalents per individual.
A series of data suggest that the number of lethal equivalents with action during the embryonic and fetal periods is very low when compared with those acting in childhood and adulthood (see Schull, 1959). These data do not cover, however, the whole pre-natal period, as no information is available for the early stages of pregnancy. The possible action of deleterious genes on these early stages has not been investigated as yet. To this

problem we shall return shortly.
A formula to be used in samples of marriages with different degrees of consanguinity has been developed by FreireMaia and Freire-Maia (1960) and applied to data from Brazilian rural populations (Freire-Maia, Freire-Maia, and Quelce-Salgado, 1960). Among Caucasians, the estimate of the mean number of lethal equivalents per person lead to a negative value (--0.37). When only marriages whose offspring had the highest coefficients of inbreeding (from 1/16 up to and including 1/8) were used, this value turned out to be 0.06. For marriages with / = 1/16, the figure was 0.10. Among Negroes, however, the corresponding value was found to be 9.12. Values of 1.20, 1.89, and 12.15 were found through the analysis of the offspring of Caucasians X Non-Caucasians (Mulattoes plus Negroes), Mulattoes X Mulattoes, and Mulattoes X Negroes.
Morton, Crow and Muller's approach was also applied to the Caucasian and Negro data obtained in Brazil (Table 1). The values of A (the intercept characterizing the mortality within the control group) are rather similar in both ethnic classes in each category (cf. also the control data in Freire-Maia et ah, 1960). This suggests that the two ethnic groups are living under similar environmental conditions. The values of B (which is the regression coefficient of the natural logarithm of the frequency of survivors on the coefficients of inbreeding and expresses the genetic load per gamete) are much higher among Negroes than among Caucasians, however. The estimates of the mean number of lethal equivalents per individual (i.e., 2B) are close enough to those obtained according to our method: a negative value for Caucasians (suggestive of a very low actual value of 2B; see also Table 2) and a value for Negroes

between 8 and 9. The difference between the values actually found for B (--0.0929 and 4.3658) is significant at the 5% level (f = 2.11). Regarding the three components of the total value of B, a significant difference was only found for abortions plus miscarriages (£=2.32; p = 0.02). For stillbirth, * = 0.73 and for post-natal mortality, £ = 0.40). For the ratio B/A, see the Discussion.
The less laborious procedure suggested by Schull (1959) was also applied to our Brazilian data (Table 2). These estimates of B also increase from Whites to Negroes. Assuming for the ethnic classes the arbitrary values ascribed to them by Freire-Maia et al. (1960), a positive correlation was also found (r = 0.87*).
Based on these three series of calculations, the mean number of lethal equivalents may be less than 1 for our Brazilian Caucasian sample and around 9 for the Negroes. As pointed out in the original paper, these results refer exclusively to the populations where the investigation was carried out. No generalization can be made uncritically.
Simoes, Mar^allo and Freire-Maia (unpublished) estimated the mean numbers of lethal and abnormal equivalents as 2-3 each, among 114 Roman Catholic families (43 being consanguineous) in Curitiba, South Brazil (4-6 deleterious equivalents). These families generally range from the middle to the high social level. The data (which include abortions, miscarriages, stillbirths, deaths from birth up to the mean marriage age, and anomalies in general) were collected by home visitations to consanguineous couples whose addresses were obtained through the cooperation of the ecclesiastical authorities. Families closely related to the consanguineous ones were used as controls. This is preliminary information on continuing research.

DISCUSSION
The classification of deleterious equivalents into lethal and abnormal equivalents is clearly artificial. They do not form clear-cut, non-overlapping categories, as each class possesses a component of the other. This criterion of classification is also somewhat unrealistic when one attempts to use it as a measure of the load of mutations carried by man, since all lethals as well as abnormals do not produce the same kind of individual and social burden to humanity. Lethals and semi-lethals acting during the first few days of pregnancy cause no pain or distress, while those acting on the first years of life may represent a tremendous source of suffering and disgrace. Also, abnormals causing small deviations from normality cannot be compared with such genes as those producing highly mutilating anomalies such as achiropody, or severe mental disorders such as schizophrenia. But even the same gene may produce different impacts, the amount of personal and social damage caused by it being also a function of the social group where it operates. For an analysis of this problem, see Wright (1960), Crowe, Schull and Neel (1956), Freire-Maia, QuelceSalgado and Koehler (1959) and FreireMaia (1960).
The mean number of deleterious equivalents per individual, as shown by the majority of the data here reviewed, lies between 4 and 12 (lethals and abnormals between 2 and 6 each). In these data, the number 8 (for deleterious) and 4 (for lethals and abnormals each) may be accepted as representing orders of magnitude.
Human groups may differ in the mean number of deleterious mutations per in-

dividual, as a consequence of different intensities of evolutionary pressures and differences with respect to the other parameters which define population structure, such as the inbreeding coefficient and the rate of assortative mating. Thus, estimates obtained in different populations need not be always in close agreement. As a matter of fact, a few exceptions to the above more common values have been found in Northern Ireland, Japan and Brazil. However, perhaps not all of these really reflect the actual situation. The discrepancy between the rather low (less than 1) value Stevenson obtained for abnormals as estimated on the basis of a direct approach, and those (from 2 to 6) which form the majority and have been obtained by semidirect methods, may be due either to the fact that not all the genetic abnormalies have been put on record in Stevenson's list, and/or that Stevenson's estimate refers to strict abnormals, not to abnormal equivalents. The exceedingly low value for abnormal equivalents (around 0.20) found by Schull in Japan is certainly due to the criterion of only computing major congenital malformations and must be accepted as only indicating an estimate of the number of equivalents for this strict class of gross abnormalities. If allowance is made for the minor congenital malformations as well as for the genetically determined and conditioned anomalies developing after birth, this estimate would be much higher, as already pointed out. We do not know, however, how high this estimate might reach.
Brazilian data are particularly impressive because they refer to two ethnic groups living practically under the same physical and social conditions and show Negroes with a number of lethal equivalents per individual significantly high-

er than Caucasians. It is rather difficult to envisage all of the factors which might make for so large a difference. No evidence of a higher mutation rate or a higher incidence of abnormalities among Negroes is known as yet (cf. Neel, 1958). Regarding natural selection, it is apparent, at least historically, that its action was stronger among Negroes than among Caucasians. Nevertheless, inbreeding seems to be (see data in Table 1 of Freire-Maia, et al., 1960), and to have been, higher among Caucasians. A rigid approach to this difference seems premature, however, in view of the paucity of the data. Clearly, further observations are to be desired.
It is well known that the mechanism of inbreeding is not equally important in all genetic situations. The inbreeding effect increases, for instance, linearly with an increasing coefficient of inbreeding in cases of monogenic traits, but the situation is much more complicated when one deals with polygenic traits or with monogenic traits capable of polygenic suppression. Moreover, inbreeding will decrease the incidence of traits due to mother-fetus incompatibility such as that regarding Rh. In a review of these problems, Levins (1959) points out that suppression of inbreeding effect (and nonlinearity) would be expected much more in old isolated populations than in populations of recent origin. A population which practiced inbreeding for a large number of generations may have developed a system of polygenic modifiers which would decrease the phenotypic manifestation of harmful genes, and thus partially remove them from the action of natural selection. The frequency of these harmful genes would increase, but the incidence of their respective phenotypes would be maintained at the same level. As geneticists work with pheno-

types to evaluate genotypes, this situation could not be readily distinguished from one where the same inbreeding effect was prevailing without the operation of polygenic modifiers.
Our Brazilian populations are not ideal ones for comparisons of this type. It is true that the Caucasian group we studied in the central state of Minas Gerais is not so heterogeneous as those found in the South, where large numbers of immigrants with quite different origins are to be found; whereas the Caucasians from Minas Gerais are almost exclusively composed of descendants from the Portuguese. It is known, however, that the present-day Caucasian populations of Minas Gerais stem from the admixture of people coming from different Portuguese isolates. The latter were undoubtedly as inbred as any other European isolate of the same period. With respect to the Negroes, the same holds for the break-up of isolates, since slaves from different tribes were brought to Brazil. It is widely known, however, that these Negro populations were characterized in their native land by social systems which tended to prevent inbreeding. Thus, Portuguese populations may have developed efficient systems of polygenic suppression of the effect of harmful recessive genes whereas Negro populations may not have. If this is true, the values of B detected in our Negro and Caucasian samples would not represent strictly comparable numbers of lethal and semi-lethal genes per gamete. The actual numbers could be the same in both samples or even higher among Caucasians, the low number of lethal equivalents among Caucasians being but the effect of a large number of modifiers. The linear correlation between the number of lethal equivalents and the ethnic composition of the couples suggests that

Negroes and Caucasians do really differ in regard to the incidence of lethal and semi-lethal genes. The linearity between inbreeding effect and values of / also supports this hypothesis. As a matter of fact, this kind of linearity is widely known in the experiments dealing with inbreeding depression (cf. Falconer, 1960).
A procedure to evaluate the relative contributions of the mutational load (due to the action of non-heterotic recessive deleterious genes maintained by recurrent mutation) and the segregational load (due to harmful recessive genes in equilibrium by the mechanism of balanced polymorphism) to the genetic load of a population has been devised by Crow (1958). He has shown that the ratio of the inbred load to the randomly mating load is 1/2/J for non-heterotic alleles with a rate h of dominance. As h in man may be roughly accepted as 0.025 (unpublished results of Hiraizumi; see Crow, 1958), the number of deaths in a completely inbred population would be 20 times larger than in a panmictic population. For overdominant genes in a system of superior heterozygotes, however, the segregational load equals st/ (s-j-t) in a random mating population (i.e., the genetic damage this population would suffer compared to an ideal population composed entirely of heterozygotes) and 2st/ (s-\-t), i.e., two times higher, in a completely inbred population. The ratio of the genetic load in an inbred population to that in a panmictic one could be obtained by dividing B by a value which one knows to be smaller than A since A includes a certain number of deaths due to non-genetic factors. As this value is not known, A may be used as a rough approximation in populations with high standards of living, where abortions, miscarriages, stillbirths and mortality dur-

ing childhood and early adulthood have relatively low incidence and may be largely due to genetic factors. In the rural zones we studied in Brazil, however, these events are primarily due to the poor conditions of living (hard work and no medical assistance during pregnancy, deficient food and clothing, high incidence of diarrhea and tetanus in early childhood, etc.). The ratio B/A may be highly misleading in such rural populations due to the enormous error introduced in A, which is much larger than the genetic damage in a random mating population. When B is very small (as in the Caucasian sample we investigated) , B/A will take rather small values and these values cannot be used for inferences regarding the contribution of the mutational load and of the segregational load to the general genetic load of the population. The ratio to be used in Crow's model is actually larger, but we do not know how large it is. When B is large (as in our Negro sample), however, B/A will take relatively high values and, as we know that A possesses a certain proportion of non-genetic deaths, the actual ratio will be still larger.
In several comparisons made with data obtained in French, American, and Japanese populations (cf. Morton et ah, 1957; Schull, 1958, 1959; Morton, 1960), the ratio B/A leads to values close to the expected ones in the model which emphasizes the over-all importance of the mutational load. (See also the paper by Kimura, 1960.) In our Negro data (Tables 1 and 2), that ratio is also large enough regarding abortions plus miscarriages, stillbirths and total to permit the conclusion that the genetic load is mainly of the mutational-load type--i.e., due to harmful genes which are being maintained in the population by recurrent mutation. All these considerations must

201

be accepted, however, with some caution,

as they have been obtained by the use of

models which may not correspond strict-

ly to reality.

'

A fourth aspect of the data deserves

some attention. As previously stated, in-

formation obtained in some populations

suggests that the number of lethals act-

ing before birth (or, to be more exact,

from about the second month of preg-

nancy until birth) is much smaller than

that with post-natal action. This fact

shows that the human embryo is so well

protected during that period, in those

populations, that deleterious genes hard-

ly impair its possibilities of survival. As

Schull (1959) pointed out, "at a time

in life when survival is as intimately as-

sociated with the mother as is true of a

developing fetus, survival of the fetus

may be as much, if not more, a function

of maternal genotype than of the fetal

genotype." A few data obtained by

Schull in Japan are in agreement with

this possibility. It is well known that, in

mammals, the inbreeding depression ob-

served in a given generation is due not

only to the inbreeding of the individuals

measured but also to the inbreeding of

their mothers (see Falconer, 1960). The

deleterious effect on the offspring of

homozygosity for a gene which is harm-

less to the mother has been discovered

by Hammond (1934) in rabbits, and a

similar situation could exist in man, as

suggested by Penrose (1940). A few

cases (including mongolism, whose

etiology was unknown at that time) re-

corded by Penrose did not contradict

this possibility. The data collected up to

now on man (Penrose, 1940; Schull,

1959), which bear directly on this prob-

lem, are too scanty to permit reliable

conclusions on this matter; however, the

large body of data on consanguineous

marriages from the three different coun-

tries mentioned above suggests that recessive mutations do not contribute greatly to pre-natal mortality. In the total Brazilian data (Table 2), the number of lethal equivalents producing embryonic and fetal deaths (0.92) seems to be not much smaller than that responsible for mortality in childhood and early adulthood (1.10). It is our impression that this may be due to the rather poor health conditions prevailing in the rural Brazilian region investigated, in comparison with the populations previously investigated.
The low economic level of the families we have studied, together with the poor hygienic conditions in which they live and the reduced medical assistance they have, decreases enormously the natural protection of the embryo. Deficient nutrition, excess of work, and untreated diseases during pregnancy could create conditions favoring the manifestation during embryonic and fetal life of sub-normal genes which would probably pass unnoticed in populations with high standards of living. It is convenient to point out, a second time, that human data on abortions never include those occurring in the first weeks of pregnancy. So, all the conclusions reached in this matter refer only to abortions occurring after the second month of gestation. Inbreeding effect may be strong in regard to early embryonic deaths and yet pass unnoticed on the basis of the data generally found in the literature. Any conclusion with such incomplete data seems to be rather premature.
It is a well-known fact that the phenotypic effect of a gene depends not only on the genetic environment, where a constellation of modifiers may have an over-all importance, but also on the external milieu. In man, it is quite probable that modern civilization is increas-

ing the frequencies of a number of deleterious genes by removing them from the action of natural selection. It seems that many detrimentals are having their frequencies increased in populations such as those investigated in Sweden, Japan, and United States, while such a process is not going on in the rural Central Brazilian populations of Minas Gerais we studied. These Brazilian populations may have, however, a large store of mutations which are slightly detrimental within their living conditions and which may prove highly deleterious--in a process of decreasing frequencies-- when subjected to the socio-economic environment of modern life. These considerations lead one to conclude that human populations living under "primitive" and "modern" conditions will develop different loads of mutations even with the same raw material. The total mutational damage (in the sense used by Morton, Crow, and Muller, 1956) found in various populations may be an expression of the differing action of natural selection on these various groups in the past.
SUMMARY
A review is made of the several (indirect, semi-direct, and direct) methods used for estimating the mean number of deleterious mutations per person. The results so obtained are presented. These findings are discussed in connection with some of their implications regarding the genetic structure and the standard of living of populations.
