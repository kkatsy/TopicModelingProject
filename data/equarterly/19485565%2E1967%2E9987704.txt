Communication
LETTER TO THE EDITOR Please allow me to comment on Professor Lejeune's letter con-
cerning my review of the book: Les chromosomes humains (caryotype normal et variations pathologiques) by Raymond Turpin and Je'rome Lejeune. It would have been more correct for me to state that certain photos appear retouched. I have since then discovered that this effect is produced by rephotographing chromosomes and adjacent nuclei which have been cut out from the original photo and laid out in the exact original position on a sheet of white paper. I deeply regret the implications of my statement and would like to add that I definitely did not mean to use the word "retouch" in the sense of having altered facts, but I simply intended to refer to the practice of painting out the background of photos so as to increase the contrast between the object and the background.
With sincerest regrets to Dr. Lejeune and your readers, I remain
Most respectfully yours,
