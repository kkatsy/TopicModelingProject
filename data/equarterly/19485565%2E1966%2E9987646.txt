FAMILY PLANNING As Practiced by Japanese National Railways Employees *

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:28 08 December 2015

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
The Japanese National Railways (hereinafter referred to as JNR) is a public corporation, a semi-governmental organization operated with funds budgeted by the government.
The total number of JNR employees is about 450,000, including about 384,000 married men.
It is essential, needless to say, for JNR to see that the welfare of its employees and their families is constantly improved, so that its services may be operated smoothly and satisfactorily. For this reason JNR is taking all sorts of measures to keep its employees in good health. Family planning is therefore being practiced as a link in the chain of JNR welfare work.
JNR commenced to take up family planning as part of its welfare work in 1956. From then on till 1964, a total of 173,700 of its married employees received guidance and instruction in family planning. To complete the implementation of this plan, five more years are required. JNR's project by year in this respect is as tabulated below:

This brief account of the family planning as carried out by Japanese National Railways employees was looked over by Dr. Yoshio Koya, consultant to this organization.

LEVELS OF RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS FIELD
OF ACTIVITY
Executive officials engaged in passenger and freight service are concurrently leading officials responsible for family planning.
Administratively, JNR is divided into 9 Regional Offices and 24 Operating Divisions. Each Region has it own committee for pushing family planning activities. The committee is composed of members who are concurrently General Manager of the region, superintendent of the division, section chief and railway hospital superintendent. The idea is to impress the general employees that family planning is a matter not to be made light of. Here is where Dr. Koya, JNR consultant, attached special importance.
The responsibility for disseminating family planning information is organized as follows (Fig. 1):
1. The Head Office notifies the General Managers of the nine Regions of all matters concerning the implementation of the family planning program.
2. Each Regional Manager has the Family Planning Committee concerned discuss ways and means to carry out the plan. Upon the basis of the decisions of the Committee, each Regional Manager gives necessary directions to the Superintendent of the Operating Division(s) under his jurisdiction.
3. Upon receiving instructions from the Regional Manager, each Division Superintendent sees to it that the Railway Hospital Superintendent, chiefs in the field, and guidance workers take necessary steps accordingly.

4. In each guidance zone from 400 to 500 households are taken care of, as a rule.
5. Generally speaking, each dormitory group consists of 100 households, which are placed under the charge of one person.
6. Each group is composed of 10 to 20 households. One family group is under the care of one person.
In Japan the number of large-scale industrial enterprises following the example of JNR is steadily on the increase.
The labor union chapters and women's societies are included in the regional family planning organs. The chairman of the union chapter and the chairwoman of each women's society are included among the members of each regional family planning committee, so that this branch of activity may be carried out without a hitch.
As will be expected, the superintendent of the regional railway hospital is called upon to become a member of each regional committee. The ladies' doctors and midwives in the region are also

called upon to lend assistance to the family planning activities, i
No less important is the cooperation of the JNR Employees Mutual Aid Association. This association bears the expense for contraceptives and contraceptive appliances. This is because family planning is considered to be as helpful in the promotion of welfare as measures taken for disease prevention, the promotion of keep-fit movement, and for such other purposes.
WHO GIVES GUIDANCE AND INSTRUCTION
IN FAMILY PLANNING?
Physicians, mainly ladies' doctors, and midwives are called on to do the job of giving guidance and instruction in family planning.
As for doctors, they are selected from among the physicians in the gynecology department of the regional railway hospital and gynecologists residing in the region.
Midwives are likewise chosen from among those of the regional railway hospital and those working in the district concerned.
The doctors thus commissioned are paid according to the amount of service done, while the midwives are given, as a rule, a monthly salary of 15,000 yen or so.
The family planning doctors take charge of public relation activities and give medical advice and, if necessary, medical treatment. They also educate and train midwives working with them.
One midwife is in charge of about 500 households, if the latter are grouped together. But if the families under their care are scattered, a suitable number of families are assigned to each midwife, according to the circumstances specific to the region.
The doctors and midwives sometimes

make the round of their assigned block and sometimes give guidance and instruction to a group of subjects assembled at any one place. They pay an average of three visits a week to the assigned families.
The doctors and midwives themselves are to be given lectures periodically by way of reeducation and reorientation, so that they may be provided with an up-todate knowledge of the subject.
RESULTS OF FAMILY PLANNING
The results hitherto obtained from the family planning measures taken by JNR are visibly encouraging.
During the three-year period of 1961 to 1963, 141,500 married JNR employees underwent family planning treatment. In terms of the amount JNR was able to save in family allowance, the amount saved by the JNR Employees Mutual Aid Association in childbirth allowance, child bringing-up allowance, and the amount the married employees would otherwise have to pay in the way of childbirth expense, induced abortion expense, and stillbirth or abortion expense, family planning produced a great economic effect, as itemized at right.
Before family planning was adopted, the annual expenditure on such items totalled �4,427,201,000, but as of the

end of 1963, this total dropped to �2,059,154,000. This means that, owing chiefly to the prevention of unwanted childbirths and the decrease in the cost of operation for induced abortion, the sum of � 2,368,047,000 *was saved annually jointly by JNR management and the JNR Employees Mutual Aid Association. The cost that the families of employees who had received family planning guidance and instruction would otherwise have spent on rearing babies and educating the young would similarly have reached a big amount.
It may be mentioned that JNR was commended by the Welfare Minister for what it did in the way of family planning. As already pointed out, in view of the good results of JNR in this field of activity, several other large industrial enterprises are fast following suit.
