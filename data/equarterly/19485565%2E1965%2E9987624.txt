A paper of this title appeared in Harofe Haivri, the Hebrew Medical Journal, for 1962 (pp. 261-275) by Louis B. Brinn of New York, discussing twelve hereditary diseases that appear to be more frequent among Ashkenazi Jewish populations of Western Europe and the United States than in neighboring populations. Eight are rare, monomeric entities of fairly reliable diagnosis. The author considers the probability of more thorough reporting among Jews; the many environmental differences between them and neighboring Gentiles--in diet, exercise, personal hygiene, mode of life, and so forth; the possibilities of the environment altering or modifying the chemical bases of these diseases. He leaves one with the impression that at least eight of these diseases represent bona fide cases of gene frequency differences between populations.
All are rare metabolic defects, with onsets usually during infancy or childhood, generally appearing in pedigrees as recessives with high penetrance and constant expressivity but occasionally appearing as dominants with low penetrance and variable expression of symptoms. Exceptions to these statements are noted below, together with references (in parentheses) to reviews citing reports of particular association with Ashkenazi populations and other points relevant to the present discussion:

Dystonia musculorum deformans (Brinn, 1962; Johnson, et al., 1962)
(torsion dystonia, etc.) Dominant in most pedigrees, with
variable expressivity.
Familial autonomic dysfunction (Brinn, 1962; Hould, 1962)
(Riley-Day Syndrome) Usually recessive but occasionally
dominant. Gauchefs disease (Brinn, 1962; Hsia,
1959; Sheba, et al., 1962; Sorsby, 1956; Stanbury, et al., 1960) (familial splenic anemia). Perhaps not a single entity. Recessive in most pedigrees but dominant in some. Onsets from infancy to early adult life.
Infantile amaurotic idiocy (Brinn, 1962; Hsia, 1959; Sheba, et al., 1962; Sorsby, 1956; Stanbury, etal., I960)
(Tay-Sachs disease)
Niemann-Picks disease (Brinn, 1962; Hsia, 1959; Stanbury, et al., I960)
(lipoid histiocytosis) Pemphigus vulgaris (1, 2) (Adair and
Owens, 1962; Brinn, 1962) Genetic basis not clear. Onset age
range 19-82, average about 55. Reported among Negroes as well as Caucasians.
Pentosuria, essential or idiopathic
(Brinn, 1962; Hsia, 1959; Sheba, et al., 1962; Stanbury, et al., 1960)
Benign: selective disadvantage very slight.
Onsets at all ages.
Polycythemia vera (Brinn, 1962; Hsia, 1959; Stanbury, et al., 1960)
(erythremia)

Genetic basis not clear; probably not a single entity.
Brinn (1962) mentions four additional "genetic" diseases that have been reported more frequently among Ashkenazi Jewish populations than among other Caucasians: idopathic hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, regional enteritis, and thrombosis obliterans. The list might be extended to include Wilson's disease and plasma thromboplastic antecedent deficiency (Stanbury, et al., 1960, pp. 831 and 1161, respectively), phenylketonuria (Hsia, 1959; Sheba, et al., 1962; Stanbury, et al., 1960), and Karposi's dermatosis. Since these diseases are not particularly uncommon among non-Jewish Caucasian populations, they will not be included in the considerations which follow.
Students of human evolution are immediately challenged to explain a marked difference between populations in the frequency of any genetic trait, whether it be normal or pathological. Brinn (1962) mentions inbreeding and genetic isolation of Ashkenazi Jews as possible explanations for their allegedly higher frequencies. Since the effect of consanguineous marriage in increasing the frequency of a recessive trait is eliminated by a single generation of random marriage and since the rate of cousin marriage in the last generation or two in Western Europe and the United States has not been high, inbreeding must be largely discounted. Genetic isolation per se can serve only to maintain a high or low gene frequency that has been previously established in a population, but not to create it. The fundamental cause, assuming no differences in mutation rates, must be sought in differential rates of natural selection between Jews and Gentiles operating over many genera-

tions and based upon differences in eco-
logical habitat or environment.
Three suggested explanations come to
mind. Since they lie beyond the quali-
fications of the present writer for de-
tailed discussion, they will be merely
mentioned. They concern contrasts be-
tween Jews and Gentiles with respect to
demographic, sociological, and epidemio-
logical situations, respectively. The first
two depend on the assumption that both
of the heterozygous parents of a patient
with a recessive disease, or one of the
parents of a patient with a dominant
disease, has been under a slight selective
disadvantage,such as would decrease the
likelihood of biological survival (normal
rate of reproduction) in the environment
of Gentiles in recent centuries, but to a
lesser degree in the environment of Ash-
kenazi Jews. In the third suggested ex-
planation a selective advantage of the
heterozygous carrier is assumed, under
the special environmental conditions of
Jewish populations.
The environmental contrasts in the
three suggested explanations are, in
brief:
Demographic situation. Continuous habitat of most Jewish populations for several millenia in cities or towns, more rarely in villages, but almost never "on the land," whereas Gentiles have been essentially rural, since town and city death rates have been so high until almost up to the turn of the past century that Gentile urban populations have been maintained only through a continuous recruiting of migrants from the surrounding countryside. Genetic carriers of these diseases might be at a selective disadvantage in rural habitats.
Sociological situation. Greater tolerance and concern of Jews for illness, handicaps, and all types of afflictions; religious customs and taboos that have effectively provided greater protection to persons handicapped or afflicted in various ways, such as is assumed (but

not established) in the heterozygote "carriers" of the genetic diseases here considered; complete absence of what might be called the "Spartan Complex," referring to the ancient Greek custom of subjecting infants to rigorous tests aimed to eliminate "weaklings," echoes of which are recognizable in former Gentile medical practices such as purging, leeching, sweat-bathing followed by a cold plunge, etc. Such customs might have eliminated Gentile carriers of these diseases more frequently than Jewish carriers, who were rarely subjected to them.
Epidemiological situation. Greater exposure of urban populations than of rural populations to infectious and contagious diseases, particularly to epidemics such as of plague and smallpox. Heterozygous carriers might have a selective advantage under the stress of these diseases, against which the genes might confer protection. Jewish populations have probably been subjected more intensively than Gentile populations to contagious diseases during the past two millenia.
The weakest point in these hypotheses
is that the allegedly heterozygous "car-
rier" is not determinable in any of these
diseases, and no information is available
as to whether it is at an advantage or
disadvantage in natural selection. Sec-
ondly, the evidence of higher frequencies
among Jews can hardly be accepted in
full when only a few hundred cases of
any of these diseases have been reported,
since the sampling may easily be biased,
particularly in large cities where most of
the cases have been found. Nevertheless,
the assumption of mild heterozygote
disadvantage is not unreasonable, and
the numbers of reports of higher fre-
quencies among Jewish patients areim-

pressive, as indicated by the authors listed in the bibliography.
Since Gentiles today are rapidly changing their ways of life in the direction of the traditional Jewish environment--with rapidly growing towns and cities, rapidly increasing protection of slightly handicapped or afflicted persons through modern public health and individual health facilities--it seems reasonable to consider the question of whether the frequencies of these eight diseases--indeed, perhaps of all genetic diseases--might become progressively greater among all modern populations in future generations. This trend would be accentuated as medical examinations, therapies, preventives, and public health facilities become further improved, producing lower juvenile and adolescent death rates and higher rates of marriage and reproduction for carriers of genetic disease.
