It has been noted that a decline in mortality is associated with a change in the birth rate in a population (Basavarajappa, 1963). A similar study was done by the writer to examine the trend of the declines in the birth rate and related measures because of the decline in mortality in a population. This indicated an interesting and very useful relationship between the birth rate and the death rate in stable populations that have the same fertility but different mortality schedules. Our aim here is to present the above relationship which is empirical and is based on the graphical representation of data, and its possible uses.
Because the birth rate and the death rate in a population depend upon the age distribution in that population, any study of the relationship between them must eliminate the effect of the age distribution. This can be done by considering stable populations; because if a population experiences constant schedules of fertility and of mortality for a long time, its age distribution approaches a stable type; and when this stable age distribution is attained, a relationship between the birth rate and the death rate exists which no longer explicitly involves the age distribution (Lotka, 1918).
* The author is indebted to Dr. N. McArthur of the Australian National University for the guidance and the critical reading of the manuscript and to Mr. C.Y. Tye of the University of Singapore for comments on the application of Figure 1.

The use of the stable population theory to study the relationship between the birth rate and the death rate in no way diminishes the applicability of the results in real populations because it has been proved that at times the populations may approach the stable age distribution very closely (Lotka, 1913).
The approach that was tried to examine the relationship between the birth rate and the death rate was based on the study of the relationship between the logarithm of the reciprocal of the birth rate per female per annum and the death rate per female per annum in stable female populations that have the same fertility but different mortality schedules. The birth rate and the death rate in a number of stable female populations are used in this study. These stable female populations with known fertility and mortality schedules were constructed by the writer. The values of the birth rate and the death rate in these populations are given in Table 1. The method of selection of fertility and mortality schedules and the calculation of the stable female population is as follows:
T H E FERTILITY SCHEDULE
In any population considered, the level of fertility was determined by the value of the gross reproduction rate; and the pattern of fertility was defined by the distribution of the gross reproduc-

tion rate over the age groups 15-19 . . . 40-44 years. At the first stage seven values of the gross reproduction rate ranging from 1.0 to 4.0 at an interval of 0.5 were considered. Assuming a constant sex ratio at birth for children born to females of age groups 15--19 . . . 40-44 years, the above gross reproduction rates were distributed over the age groups 15-19 . . . 40-44 years in the ratio 1:7:7:6:4:1 (United Nations, 1956). At the second stage three different patterns of fertility for the same level of the gross reproduction rate (2.64) were considered. Two of the three patterns were taken from a study by Coale and Tye (1961), who gave examples of early and late fertility patterns. The early pattern of fertility corresponds to the distribution of the gross reproduction rate over the age groups 15--19 . . . 4044 years in the ratio 92:130:121:91: 67:26, whereas the corresponding distribution of the late pattern of fertility is 19:118:145:124:83:37. The third pattern was chosen again to give the distribution of the gross reproduction rate over the age groups 15-19 . . . 40-44 in the ratio 1:7:7:6:4:1.
T H E MORTALITY SCHEDULE
Two sets of mortality schedules were chosen. The first set consisted of the mortality schedules given by the U.N. Model Life Tables for females corresponding to the expectation of life at birth, 20.20, 30.40, 40.74, 51.81, 62.05, and 71.80 years, referred to as at levels 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100, respectively (United Nations, 1956). The second set was denned by the actual life tables for females in countries like India (19211930), Union of South Africa--nonwhite population (1935-1937)--Japan (19261930), United States--negro population (1939-1941)--and New Zealand (19341938). The size of the stationary popu-

lation in the age group x to x -f 4 years

(5La) in these populations needed for

our purpose was not directly available;

therefore it was obtained from the fol-

lowing formula:

:

where ex° is the expectation of life at age x in years and \x is the number of survivors at age x in the stationary population with 100,000 annual live births. Values of 1,,. and ex° for the female population of India were taken from the Demographic Year Book (United Nations, 1948), and those for the rest of the populations were taken from the United States Life Tables and Actuarial Reports, 1939-1941 (Greville, 1947).
CALCULATION OF THE STABLE FEMALE
POPULATION
The method of calculating the stable female population is the same as that given by Glass (1940), and it is described briefly as follows: A known schedule of the age-specific female fertility rates is combined with a known schedule of the female mortality given in the form of a life table, and the value of the natural rate of growth (r) in the population is calculated from the formula (Glass, 1940):

R.
where Ro is the net reproduction rate and R± and R2 are the first and the second moments of the curve representing the age schedule of net reproductivity. The different combinations of the fertility and the mortality schedules mentioned earlier were used to calculate the value of r.
The calculated value of r for a given schedule of fertility and mortality, combined with the same mortaility schedule

that was used in the calculation of r, yielded the stable female population and its age distribution. The birth rate (b) per female per annum in these populations was obtained by the formula:
b = 1 / S c-""s» si.,
where x is the lower limit of the age group in years and takes the values 0, 5, 10 . . . 80 and iLx gives the life table population in the age group x to x + 4 years. For the last age group, 85+ years, the central value of the age group was taken as 85+685° a n d *LX was replaced by L85+. The death rate per female per annum was obtained from the relation b-d = r.
FIGURE 1
Figure 1, which gives the relationship between the logarithm of the reciprocal of the birth rate per female per annum and the death rate per female per annum in stable female populations with the same fertility but different mortality schedules, presents seven graphs, each of which corresponds to a known level of fertility in the population which is defined by the value of the gross reproduction rate in that population. The pattern of the age-specific female fertility rates for each of the seven graphs is the same; that is, the distribution of the gross reproduction rate over the age groups 15-19 . . . 40-44 years is in the ratio 1:7:7:6:4:1. With each fertility schedule, six mortality schedules given by the U.N. Model Life Tables for females at levels 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 were combined to give six stable female populations. The birth rates and the death rates in these six populations were used to obtain one graph of the figure. For example, the gross reproduction rate unity was combined with the U.N. Model Life Tables for females at levels 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100; and

six stable female populations were constructed. The birth rates and the death rates in the above six populations were used to obtain the graph corresponding to a gross reproduction rate of 1.0. Similarly, six other values of the gross reproduction rate ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 at an interval of 0.5 were used to obtain the other graphs. These graphs are distinguished from each other by the value of the gross reproduction rate in the population. For each of the graphs the reciprocal of the birth rate per female per annum was plotted on the Yaxis on a logarithmic scale, and the death rate per female per annum was plotted on the X-axis on a linear scale. The seven "almost" parallel straight lines of this figure obtained in this manner indicate that if there is a difference between the values of the gross reproduction rates and not in the distribution of the gross reproduction rate according to age in stable female populations that experience different mortality schedules given by the U.N. Model Life Tables for females, the relationship between the logarithm of the reciprocal of the birth rate and the death rate is given by "almost" parallel straight lines, each of which corresponds to a value of the gross reproduction rate in the population.
FIGURE 2
Figure 2 gives three graphs, each of which gives the relationship between the logarithm of the reciprocal of the birth rate per female per annum and the death rate per female per annum in stable female populations that have the same fertility but different mortality schedule. The three graphs correspond to the same level of fertility; that is, the value of the gross reproduction rate in each of the stable populations is 2.64, but its distribution over the age groups 15-19 . . . 40-44 years is different for each of the

each set have the same schedules of fertility but different schedules of mortality which are given by the U.N. Model Life Tables for females, we get a linear relationship between the logarithm of the reciprocal of the birth rate and the death rate in the populations of each set separately. The linear relationships thus observed have different slopes, and the straight lines are found to converge at a point. The point at which these straight lines converge determines the birth rate and the death rate in a stable female population where the difference between the birth rates because of the difference between the age patterns of fertility, the gross reproduction rate remaining the same, reduces to zero. This figure also shows that the difference between the birth rates because of the difference between the age patterns of fertility in stable female populations with a higher mortality level is lower than that in the populations with a lower level of mortality.
Figures 1 and 2 show that the relationship between the logarithm of the reciprocal of the birth rate per female per annum and the death rate per female per annum in stable female populations is linear, provided the fertility schedule in these populations is the same and the mortality schedules are the same as those of the U.N. Model Life Tables for females. It should be mentioned that the life tables used here present a series of patterns of mortality tables in transition from high to low levels of mortality (United Nations, 1956). But, because the mortality rate in a quinquennial age group in each of the model life tables was obtained by using the same relationship between the mortality level of that age group and the preceding age group, the pattern of mortality in each of these life tables is very similar (United Nations, 1955, 1956). These model life

tables differ from each other distinctly in respect of the mortality level because each of these corresponds to a specific value of the infant mortality rate. This suggests that if the fertility in a population is constant and the mortality declines in such a manner that there is no "marked" difference between the patterns of mortality before and after the decline, the logarithm of the reciprocal of the birth rate per female per annum and the death rate per female per annum will have a linear relationship. If there is a marked difference between the mortality patterns before and after the decline in mortality, this linear relationship may not be true. This was verified by considering the birth rate and the death rate in five stable female populations that have the same fertility; but the mortality patterns in these populations are defined by the actual life tables for females in populations like India (1921-- 1930), Union of South Africa--nonwhite population (1935-1937), Japan (19261930), United States--negroes (1939-41), and New Zealand (1934-1938). When the values of the birth rates and the death rates in these populations were used to obtain curves as in the above figures, there was no linear relationship between the logarithm of the reciprocal of the birth rate per female per annum and the death rate per female per annum.
USES OF FIGURE 1
The uses of the figure assume: 1. That the distribution of the gross reproduction rate over the age groups 15-19 . . . 40-44 years is in the ratio 1:7:7:6:4:1, and the mortality pattern is determined by one of the U.N. Model Life Tables for females; and 2. That in such populations that have deficient population statistics, the vital rates are estimated by using the stable

population theory and the U.N. Model Life Tables.
As the difference between the patterns of fertility and mortality in the population and that given by the U.N. models may cause a difference between the vital rates in the population, the estimates derived from this figure should be taken as an approximation only. Nevertheless, if the estimates of the intrinsic birth rate and the intrinsic death rate in a female population are known, this figure can help in estimating the decline in the birth rate for a predetermined decline in the death rate, provided the fertility level and pattern in the population remain unchanged. This can be done by locating a point on the figure correponding to the above estimates of the birth rate and the death rate and drawing a straight line through that point and parallel to the straight line nearest to the point in the figure. The value of the changed birth rate corresponding to the changed death rate can then be read from the straight line thus drawn.
Further, if the estimates of the intrinsic birth rate and the intrinsic death rate in a population are available, the approximate value of the gross reproduction rate in that population can be determined from this figure. The method of obtaining the approximate value of the gross reproduction rate in such populations is to locate a point in the figure corresponding to the birth rate and the death rate in the female population. Determine the values of the gross reproduction rates corresponding to two straight lines on either side of the point. Simple interpolation of these two gross reproduction rates in proportion to the perpendicular distance between the point and one of the straight lines to the perpendicular distance between the two straight lines (which are on either side of the point) with due regard to sign

will yield the approximate value of the gross reproduction rate in the population. Application of this method of estimating the gross reproduction rate is given in the following example.
Example
Two hundred and ninety three populations selected for the application of the preceding method of estimating the gross reproduction rate in a population satisfied the following criteria:
1. The gross reproduction rate is known, and it is more than unity but less than four; and
2. The values of the intrinsic rates in female populations based on the known gross reproduction rates are given.
Such populations are given in the Population Index, April 1963.
The known value of the gross reproduction rate in the population is taken to be its true value, and the estimated value of the gross reproduction rate is compared with its observed value in the population. The magnitude of the absolute difference between the two gross reproduction rates is defined as the error. The distribution of this error according to the gross reproduction rate is given in Table 2.
It is clear from this table that there is no definite pattern of the magnitude of the error according to the value of the gross reproduction rate in the population. In 263 of the 293 populations considered, the absolute error is less than 0.10. In 22 cases the error is between 0.10 and 0.19, and in only 8 cases the error exceeds 0.20 with a maximum of 0.42. It is interesting to note that of these 8 cases, 6 belong to the population of Costa Rica and 2 belong to the population of United States--nonwhites in years 1943 and 1960. The main reason for such a large error in 8 populations might be the considerable difference be-

tween the schedules of fertility and mortality prevailing in the population and those used in constructing the figure.
Considering the variations in the age pattern of fertility and mortality in each of the populations considered, it may be inferred that the approximate estimate of the gross reproduction rate obtained from Figure 1 is very near to the true value of the gross reproduction rate in the population.
