Importance of occupation as a classificatory variable in a study of differential fertility hardly needs an introduction. Inverse relation between occupation and fertility has been observed even in the past, when modern contraceptive devices were not known. Differences in age at marriage and traditional modes of conception control were, among others, responsible for these differentials, which have widened since modern scientific methods became available.
Current high fertility rates among lower socioeconomic groups are no doubt explained by none or ineffective use of birth control techniques. Occupation, insofar as it determines the style of life and is associated with other characteristics of social stratification, influences, at least indirectly, one's attitude and behavioral complex of which reproduction is a significant index.
The factors that influence and the results they produce are both dynamic particularly in modern industrialized societies. Two identical occupational groups at two time periods will show dissimilarities even though other variables like age, education, income, etc. are taken into consideration. Consequently, fertility differentials have also changed; but they are there, although recently they may have lost some of the regularities that were so characteristic of the past. The question as to whether differential fertility will continue to remain associated with social stratification cannot be answered now. This will depend on the

extent to which knowledge of fertility
control diffuses to the lowest stratum and
motivates into action.
Occupation has long since been recog-
nized by the census authorities as an im-
portant index of socioeconomic ¡ status.
Until now, occupational redistribution
has been found to have significant rela-
tion with changes in national fertility.
Occupation as a classificatory item has
both its advantages and drawbacks. First
of all, fertility refers to the female popu-
lation, whereas occupation is, practically
everywhere in the world, a characteristic
of the husband of a married woman.
Grabill et al. (1958) have succinctly put
these as:
. . . a small proportion of wives do not describe their husband's occupation with sufficient accuracy to have it placed in the correct broad class. It is also commonly recognized that the conventional broad occupational groups contain a wide variety of specific occupations and a wide range of social and economic gradation. Unlike educational attainment (but like rental and economic status), occupation is subject to change. This subjection to change is advantageous for purposes of intragenerational social mobility; it is disadvantageous for application in measures of fertility like gross or net reproduction rate. It should also be noted that whereas educational, income, and rental classifications are quantitative and continuous, the occupational classifications usually are more qualitative and discrete. Finally, it should be pointed out that whereas educational attainment is equally applicable to single and married women, occupational group of the husband, by definition, cannot be applied to single

women. Since it is an attribute of husbands enumerated in the census, occupation of the husband is not obtainable from the census data for women classified as widowed, divorced or separated. Hence, the data by occupational group are available only for women described as "married and husband present."
DISTRIBUTION OF WOMEN BYOCCUPATION
To make the analysis simple, the data used in this study are further restricted to women who have been married only once. However, this limitation is not serious in view of the fact that such women represent 86% of all who are presently married.1
The distribution of white women by age and occupation is shown in Table 1.
The percentage distributions are naturally based on women whose husbands' occupations were reported in the census. In the year 1960, occupations of husbands were not reported in 7.2%of cases
1 The 1960 figures reported here are all based upon one in one thousand sample drawn by the Bureau of the Census.

for married women in the 15 to 19age group. The corresponding figure for 20 to 24 age group is 4.2% and is less than 4% for the remaining age groups.
Over the decade, the relative distribution of farmers and farm managers has experienced a dramatic decline. This is also true for farm laborers and foremen. Notable increases in the professional, technical, craftsmen, foremen, and kindred workers support the tendency for people to be upwardly mobile. It is yet to be seen whether the percentage of population engaged in occupations related to farm can further decline.
A similar table for nonwhites is Table 2.
The reduction in farmers and farm managers is even more dramatic for the nonwhites than for their white counterparts. In fact, the percentages in 1960 are very similar for the two races. The percentage decline in farm laborers is relatively less for the nonwhites; as a result, the ratio of the white/nonwhite percentages has declined. Upward mo-

bility among the nonwhites can be observed from the increases in clerical and craftsmen categories. The professional category also shows signs of increase; but the gap separating whites and nonwhites has only been widened, as pointed out by Grabill et al (1958), comparing 1950 and 1960 percentages that "the differences by color in occupational composition reflect at once differences in educational attainment and in occupational opportunity." The first four occupational categories cover more than 60% of the husbands of white women aged 25 and over, and the corresponding nonwhites cluster around 30%.
FERTILITY AND OCCUPATION
Fertility differentials among major occupational categories can be examined by studying the cumulative fertility rates by quinquennial age groups of mothers. Table 3 describes the position of white women.
With one minor exception women aged 35 to 39 have already given birth

to larger numbers of children than have their predecessors. In fact, the mothers aged 30 to 34 of all but the last two occupational groups, have borne more children than those who are 40 years or over. The different cohorts of women, therefore, demonstrate unequal child-bearing experiences. It is highly probable that at least until 1975, completed fertility of a given cohort of mothers will be higher than their predecessor cohorts.
Comparisons among different occupational groups of the total number of children born become difficult due to several reasons. Mothers of two different age groups but in the same occupational category have different life experiences, and they have entered this group at different points in their life cycle. Thus, so far as values and attitudes influence one's family function, mothers aged 45 to 49 at present were not, when they were 10 years younger, the same as those who are 35 to 39 at present in the same occupational category. However, occupation is only a part of the total environ-

ment. Considering the social, economic and other changes that affect and modify one's outlook on life, comparison among groups becomes a hopeless task, not only between two different time periods, but also at any instant of time.
In spite of all these difficulties, there are variations that are distinct enough to be labeled as occupational differentials in fertility patterns, particularly if age group is held constant and total fertility is examined by major occupation. However, the pattern of variations does not remain uniform over different age groups, which would be a little too much to expect. The findings in Table 3 confirm that there is no occupational category with the lowest numbers of children born, regardless of age. On the other hand, farm laborers and foremen have the highest fertility for all ages with one minor exception.
A single index comparing the fertility differentials by occupations over all age groups can be constructed by standardization. In this analysis a less refined and simpler index has been obtained. For every age group, the occupations have been ranked in the reverse order; i.e. the occupation with the minimum number

of children born per 1,000 women has been ranked as 1, second minimum as 2, and so on. As there are seven age and nine occupational groups, the sum total of the ranks for each occupation can be expected to range from a minimum of 7 to a maximum of 63.
These ranks have been shown in the last two columns of the Table 3 for the years 1960 and 1950. The relative positions of the occupational groupings has not altered except that a tie in the first two positions has been broken in 1960. At present, cumulative fertility appears to be the lowest among clerical, sales, and kindred workers; second lowest being the professional, technical, and kindred workers. The disparity between the groups managers, etc., and service workers, etc., has considerably narrowed down over the decade; these groups are hardly distinguishable at this time. Similarly, laborers excluding farm and mine and farmers and farm managers almost happen to be tied together in 1960.
The sums of ranks have not moved by more than 4 points in either direction over this 10-year period. This was enough, however, to suggest possible changes in the relative positions of the

occupational groups. What in fact has happened is that the relative increase in fertility over the decade varied considerably to alter the distribution of ranks. This will be evident when the cumulative fertility figures are examined for a few censuses. The situation of the nonwhites may be seen in Table 4.
For all age groups, the cumulative fertility rates are higher than those of whites, and the differences range from 0.4 to 1.0. Differentials among some occupations are more pronounced than others. What appears to be particularly important is the fact that nonwhites have borne, on an average, fewer children than have their white counterparts in two occupational groups, which also were the two groups with minimum numbers of children born: the professional, technical, etc., and clerical, sales, etc., workers, respectively. However, their contribution to the total fertility of nonwhites is hardly enough in view of their small proportion to the total population. In any case, the finding suggests that the influences of social status, if any, on the family formation, hardly discriminate between the races.

CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS
Occupational differentials in fertility can be investigated further by place of residence. Some of the occupations, however, are characteristic of urban areas. Farmers and farm managers ordinarily will be living in rural farm areas, rural nonfarm being somewhere in the fringe. The number of children born per 1,000 women has been examined by place of residence for four different censuses (1910, 1940, 1950, and 1960) andicrossclassified further by occupational categories. It has been found (figures not shown here for lack of space) that for the last three censuses, 1960 fertility is highest for women below 40 years of age, and the same remains true for women aged less than 35 when 1910 figures are also brought into comparison. Generally speaking, fertility is lowest in urban areas for all age and occupational groups, as was also found in the previous censuses. However, changes in fertility trend are hardly uniform; e.g., increases in cumulative fertility over the last decade not only had a wide range of variation by age and occupation but were also different by places of residence.

The following summary of principal findings seems to be in order. Noticeable decline in proportions engaged in farm and corresponding increase in professional, technical, craftsmen, and kindred worker categories have been observed regardless of race. Cumulative fertility has increased over the decade, and white women aged 35 to 39 were found to have given birth to more children than had their predecessor cohorts. As a result, it is extremely likely that cumulative fer-

tility in 1970 will show an increase over 1960, and the same pattern may continue until 1980. A moderate decline in recent and future fertility will hardly alter this course of cohort fertility.
