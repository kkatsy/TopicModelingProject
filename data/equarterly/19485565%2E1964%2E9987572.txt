INTRODUCTION
The level of education achieved by each person undoubtedly is related in part to the amount of intellectual ability he has inherited. Unfavorable economic or social environment or unfortunate features of personality may prevent a young man or young woman from achieving the level of education of which he or she is potentially capable. Hereditary factors controlling intellectual ability and at least some features of personality, nevertheless, limit the educational achievements which are possible for each person.
Insofar as the levels of education achieved by the members of any population are related to their inherited capabilities, maintaining the current supply of hereditary ability requires that the better educated members should produce at least as many children per person as the more poorly educated members. In many industrial societies, however, the more highly educated men and women are reported to have fewer children than the less well educated persons (Lorimer and Osborn, 1934; Riser, 1942; Whelpton and Riser, 1943; United Nations, 1953; Grabill, Riser, and Whelpton, 1958). Alarm has consequently been expressed by students of the subject that the heredity of our population in respect to ability may be deteriorating (Holmes, 1923; Cook, 1951; Dice, 1960).
The degree of negative differential fer-

tility in relation to amount of education is said to have decreased in recent years in the United States (Westoff, 1954, Grabill, Riser, and Whelpton, 1958; Freedman and others, 1959), but a negative differential is reported by most students of the subject still to occur.
Unfortunately, most past studies of the relation between fertility and education have been based on the married persons only in the population being investigated. The omission from consideration of the never-married persons, and sometimes also of those divorced, separated, and widowed, may have produced an inaccurate indication of the relation between fertility and education in each population so studied (Higgins, Reed, and Reed, 1962). Further, the samples on which some past studies of the relation between fertility and education have been based were not fully random and may not have adequately represented these relations within the populations concerned.
Changes in family size, availability of education, and economic opportunities have occurred in recent decades in almost all parts of the world. The relation between fertility and level of education may be presumed, therefore, to be currently in process of change in many human populations. The eugenic relations that existed 30 or even 10 years ago in any given region may consequently no longer prevail.
Reliable information about the relation between fertility and level of education in particular human populations actually is scanty. Additional studies of

the relation of fertility to education and to other attributes that may measure human ability are consequently needed.
This report will describe the relationship between number of children per person and amount of education in the adult population of Ann Arbor, Michigan, as exhibited by a random sample taken in 1951-54. A previous report based on this sample has described the relation between fertility and body dimensions (Clark and Spuhler, 1959).
THE SAMPLE
The persons on which this study is based were chosen at random in two stages from the adult resident population of Ann Arbor, Michigan. The primary sampling units were defined so that each contained between 10 and 20 dwellings or apartments. The city of Ann Arbor was divided into 699 such primary sampling units, of which 108 were selected at random in the first stage of sampling. A field census was made of all the adults resident in each primary unit selected for study. Females were considered to be adult when 17 years and males when 18 years of age. The individuals in each sampling unit were classified into married pairs, single females, and single males. A single person was defined as one not currently married or not currently living with his spouse at the time of the census, regardless of his previous marital status. From these categories \ of the married pairs, \ of the single females, and \ of the single males were selected at random in the second and final stage of sampling. A higher selection rate was used for single males than for single females because there were fewer of the former than of the latter in the population. The selections were made and the information collected during 1951-54, inclusive.

The 545 adult males and 546 adult females thus drawn at random were each asked to come to the Institute of Human Biology, University of Michigan, for a set of anthropométrie measurements and to fill out a detailed (long-form) questionnaire. For those who for any reason failed to come to the Institute for measurement, a shorter questionnaire (shortform) was filled out.
Only adults who were residents of the city at the time of the field study were included in the sample. Unmarried nonresident students were not included. Married students were included, however, because they were considered to have their homes in Ann Arbor. The population of Ann Arbor as thus defined consequently differs from that of the 1950 census, which included unmarried as well as married students.
The adult resident population of Ann Arbor is estimated from our sample to have consisted in 1951-54 of 25,940 persons. The census of 1950 (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1952) gives the closely similar figure of 25,988 persons within our age limits when allowance is made for the number of nonresident students attending the University of Michigan. Our sample of 1091 persons, therefore, is approximately a 4.2 percent sample of the adult population resident in Ann Arbor during 1951-54.
Ascertainment is complete for the sex, age class, marital status, and race of each of the 1091 persons included in the sample.
Most of the inhabitants of Ann Arbor belong to the white race. Of the 1091 persons included in the sample only 44 were Mongolians, 17 reported Negro ancestry, and 4 reported American Indian X white ancestry. Because of the small number of nonwhites in the sample it is impractical to attempt any comparison

of the educational achievements or relative fertility of whites and nonwhites. In our analyses the persons included in the sample have consequently been treated without regard to their racial origins.
SPECIAL METHODS EMPLOYED
Inasmuch as one-half of the single males, but only one-fourth of the married males were drawn from the sampling units, single males are over-represented in the sample. To compensate for this over-representation, the number of single males in each category may be divided by 2 and added to those of the married males to produce an adjusted sample of males. Such an adjusted sample of males has been used in the calculation of means, proportions, ratios, and coefficients. In computing the significance of variations among the several classes of any given attribute, however, the unadjusted sample has been employed. The same proportions--one-fourth, of single and of married females--were included in the sample, so no adjustment of the sample has been necessary for the females.
The statistical treatments have been performed without the measurements being subjected to any kind of transformation. The frequency curves of persons with each number of years of education are, it is true, skewed toward the upper levels. The frequency curves of the number of children are even more strongly skewed toward the zero end of the scale. The significance levels quoted, therefore, are approximations only. Nevertheless, the numbers in the classes compared are usually sufficiently large to provide a reasonably accurate indication of significance.
The age classes used in this report are 24 years and younger (-25), 25-30, 3040, 40-50, 50-60, 60-70, and 70 years and

older (70+), respectively. The --25 and 25-30 age classes often will be combined to form a 30- class. The overlap in ages at each end of the intermediate age classes is caused by a difference between the long-form and short-form samples in the age codings employed. No serious bias, however, would be expected to result from this overlap in age classes.
For computing the coefficients of correlation between number of children and amount of education, the number of years of education has been taken to be 4 for those with 0-6 years of grade school, 8 for those with 7-9 years, 11 for those with 10-12 years in school, 12 for the graduates of senior high school or equivalent, 13 for those who had completed business or secretarial training after high school, 14 for those with 2 years or less of college, 15 for those with less than 4 but more than 2 years of college, 16 for college graduates, and 17 for those with 1 or more years of graduate study.
SEX RATIO
Females outnumber males in the adult Ann Arbor population, as in most cities. The number of males per 100 females in the adjusted sample is 75.6 for those 30 years and younger, 87.1 for those 30 to 50 years, 89.6 for those 50 to 70 years, and 76.5 for those 70 years and older.
For ages above 30 years the proportion of males in the Ann Arbor resident population as defined by us is less than in the neighboring cities of Bay City and Jackson (U. S. Bureau of Census, 1952). This may be due to the fact that women are employed in large numbers by the University and by other local institutions and industries and that many widowed and divorced women make their home in Ann Arbor in order to enjoy the cultural advantages of the city.

EDUCATION
Those persons drawn in the sample who came to the Institute to be measured included a greater proportion of the better educated than of the less well educated members of the sample. Thus, 72 percent of the males and 77 percent of the females in the adjusted sample who had some education beyond high school came to the Institute, but only 51 percent of the males and 59 percent of the females with a high-school education or less did so. Contingency tables comparing the short-form sample to the long-form sample with respect to the proportion of individuals having less than a high-school education on the one hand or a high-school education or better on the other hand, yield chi-square values which are significant at the 1 percent level, both for the males and for the females. It is evident, therefore, that the better educated persons in the population were more cooperative with the study than those who had received less

schooling, possibly because most of them were younger.
Information is lacking about the education of 10 of the males and 19 of the females in the short-form sample. Because the better educated persons were more cooperative with the study than the more poorly educated ones, it is suspected that a majority of the persons about whom information concerning education is lacking had received only small amounts of schooling. Ascertainment about level of education, therefore, is believed to be more complete for the higher than for the lower educational levels. Information about education, however, was obtained for 98.0 percent of the males and 96.5 percent of the females in the adjusted sample (Table 1). The error introduced into our analyses by lack of information about the few missing persons, therefore, must be small.
The younger persons in the sample have in general a higher level of education than those who are older. Of those

in the adjusted sample aged 30-40 years, for example, 55 percent of the males and 23 percent of the females had received a college education or better, while of those from 60-70 years old only 15 percent of the males and 6 percent of the females had graduated from college (Table 1).
The differences in level of education between the younger and older age classes in the sample reflect the considerable increase in educational opportunities during recent decades. Very few persons in the sample aged less than 40 years had received less than 10 years of schooling. In fact, most of those aged younger than 40 years had received at least a high-school education.
One or more years of graduate training had been completed by a surprisingly large number of the young males in the adjusted sample, 33.9 percent of those in the 30- age class and 48.7 percent of those in the 30-40 class (Table 1). This large proportion of highly educated males in these age classes is due to the concentration in Ann Arbor of students attending the graduate and professional schools of the University. Many of these students were married and thus were included in the sample.
As would be expected in a university city, a large proportion of the citizens of Ann Arbor are well educated. Approximately one-third (31.2 percent) of the males and nearly one-fifth (18.8 percent) of the females aged 30 years and older included in the adjusted sample were college graduates. This is a much higher proportion of college graduates than occurs in the state of Michigan as a whole. As reported in the 1950 census, only 14.4 percent of the males and 12.2 percent of the females aged 25 years and older in the urban population of Michigan had spent 4 years or more in college or university (U. S Bureau of Census, 1952,

Table 20). Of those in the adjusted sample from Ann Arbor, 22.8 percent of the males and 6.2 percent of the females aged 30 years and older not only had graduated from college, but had spent one or more additional years in graduate study.
Ann Arbor ranks high among Michigan cities also in the proportion of highschool graduates in its population. Of those in the adjusted sample 30 years and older, 60.2 percent of the males and 56.7 percent of the females had graduated from senior high school or had received a greater amount of education. In comparison, of the urban population of Michigan aged 25 years and older reported in the 1950 census, only 34.5 percent of the males and 38.0 percent of the females had spent 4 years in high school or had received additional education.
Persons with low levels of education are relatively few in Ann Arbor and restricted mostly to the older age classes. Formal education was completely lacking for only 1 male (0.2 percent) and 2 females (0.4 percent) of those in the adjusted sample for whom we have information about schooling.
The recent increase in the amount of schooling each person receives has of course affected the ages at which young men and young women complete their formal education. Thus, high school usually is finished by the age of 18 years, while training for a profession may not be complete until the age of 25 or 30 or even older. Any analysis of educational achievements must consequently consider the ages of the persons being compared.
EDUCATION AND MARRIAGE
A greater proportion of the better educated women in the sample had never married than of those who had received

Vol. 11, No. 1

less schooling. Of the females aged 30 years and older, for example, 19.2 percent of those with a college degree had never married, compared to 6.8 percent never married of those with 12-15 years of schooling and to 8.6 percent never married of those with 11 years or less of education.
In the males the relation between amount of education and marriage is generally positive instead of negative as it is in the females. Of the males in the adjusted sample aged 30 years and older, for example, 7.6 percent of those who had graduated from college and 4.1 percent of those with 12-15 years of education had never married, compared to 12.0 percent never married of those with 11 years or less of schooling.
The numbers of never-married males and females included in the sample, however, are few. Of the 329.0 males and 372 females in the adjusted sample aged 30 years and older, for example, only 27.0 males and 37 females had never married. The number of never-married persons in each age class is consequently usually too few for a satisfactory statistical analysis of the significance of the relation between education and marriage.
FERTILITY
The number of children recorded for each person included in the sample was the number reported by that individual. No attempt was made to ascertain the frequency of illegitimacy in the Ann Arbor population nor its relation to the level of education of the parents involved. Only one never-married person included in the sample reported an illegitimate child. The proportion of illegitimate births in the state of Michigan in 1956 is reported to have been 32.1 per 1000 live births (U. S. Public Health Service, 1958, Vol. 1: 282).

Information is lacking for the number of children of 4 males and of 6 females included in the sample. The fertility of 99.1 percent of the males and 98.9 percent of the females in the adjusted sample, however, is known.
The fertility of the males and of the females is here treated separately; thus some children are counted twice, once for the father and once for the mother.
The number of children produced by the currently married, previously married, and never-married males and females were recorded separately. In most of our estimates of fertility, however, all the persons of each sex have been treated as a group, without regard to their current marital status. In the treatment of fertility it is impractical to consider the length of married life of each person, the respective ages of husband and wife during the period of marriage, their possible successive mates, or the economic conditions to which they were subjected during their reproductive years (Clark and Spuhler, 1959).
The proportion of those persons drawn in the sample who came to the Institute to be measured (long-form sample) appears not to be related in any important manner to their fertility. Contingency tables comparing the long-form and short-form samples according to number of children (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more) yield chi-squares which are nonsignificant at the 5 percent level both for males (P=.50) and for females (.90>P>.75).
The greatest number of children reported by any male in the sample was 8 and by any female was 12 (Table 2). Such large families, however, are mostly restricted to the older persons. Of those persons aged younger than 50 years, none of the males had produced as many as 6 and none of the females as many as 7 children.

In all the younger age classes the mean number of children is greater for the females than for the males. The mean number of children in the 30-40 age class, for example, is 1.57 for the males but 1.80 for the females. The mean for the females of the 30-40 age class is in fact approximately the same as the mean (1.81) for the males of the 40-50 age class (Table 3). The smaller mean number of children of the males than of the females in these younger age classes undoubtedly is due mostly to the somewhat older age of the male than of the female in most married pairs. At ages older than 40 years the sexes exhibit no consistent difference in mean number of children per person.
RELATION BETWEEN FERTILITY AND
EDUCATION
The relationship between number of children and level of education is meas-

ured in this report by the coefficient of correlation. In calculating this coefficient it is assumed that the relation between these two attributes is orthogonal. Table 3 indicates that there is generally a straight-line relationship between number of children and level of education both for the males and for the females in the sample. No one level of education appears to be consistently out of line among the age classes in respect to mean number of children.
For the males in the sample the coefficients of correlation between number of children and number of years of education are negative in the age classes 30and 30-40, positive for the ages 40-50 and 50-60, and again negative for the ages 60-70 and 70+ (Table 4). The coefficients in all the age classes of the males, however, are nonsignificant at the 5 percent level.

The females in the sample exhibit much the same pattern of age variation as the males in the relation between their fertility and their level of education. Their coefficients of correlation are negative for the 30- age class, positive for ages 30-40 and 40-50, and again negative for ages 50-60, 60-70, and 70+ (Table 4). The coefficients are small and nonsignificant at the 5 percent level for the two positive age classes 30--40 and 40-50, but range from --.25 to--.35 and are significant at the .05 to .001 levels for the 30-, 50-60, 60-70, and 70+ age classes.

The females in the sample aged 50 years and older and who consequently had completed their families thus exhibit a fairly large, consistent, and significant negative correlation between the number of their children and the amount of their education. Those females aged 50-60 years, for example, who had received a senior high-school education or less have a mean of 2.52 children, while those in this age class who had received one or more years of education beyond high school have a mean of only 1.50 children.

The negative differential fertility in relation to education exhibited by the older females in our sample of the Ann Arbor population parallels that reported in the 1950 census for the ever-married female population of the United States (Grabill, Kiser, and Whelpton, 1958: 239).
MARITAL STATUS AND DIFFERENTIAL
FERTILITY
Many past studies of the relation of fertility to education or to other attributes which may have eugenic significance have been based on the number of children produced by the currently married or ever-married persons only. The omission of the never-married persons from the computations, however, must result in too high an estimate of the fertility of the population being considered. Moreover, should amount of education be related to marriage, the omission of the never-married persons may result in an erroneous estimate of the relation between fertility and education (Higgins, Reed, and Reed, 1962).
Those persons who marry when young are handicapped in going on for a college or graduate education. This is especially true of young women. When a woman marries, her formal education usually is terminated. Women who do not marry when young are more likely to continue their education in order to prepare for a chosen career. Those females who marry at a young age will consequently usually have a smaller amount of schooling than those who marry later in life or who never marry (Lorimer and Osborn, 1934; Grabill, Kiser, and Whelpton, 1958). The educational achievements of married women, therefore, may not as fully represent their mental capacities as do those of un-

married women. This is probably true to some degree of men also.
The coefficients of correlation between number of children and years of education of the females in our sample, however, are changed only slightly when those who had never married are omitted and the computations are based only on those ever married. The major difference is that for the 30-40 age class the coefficient of correlation is +.018 for the females of all marital-status classes combined, but is --.377 and significant at the .001 level for the ever-married females alone. The coefficient for the 40-50 age class remains positive and nonsignificant at the .05 level. For all ages older than 50 years the coefficients are negative and significant at the .05 level or better, both for the ever-married females and for the total sample of females.
The males in the sample likewise exhibit much the same relation between fertility and level of education whether or not those who had never married are included in the computations. The negative coefficient of correlation between number of children and years of education for the males aged 18-30 is --.100 for the total sample, but is --.301 and significant at the .01 level when the evermarried males only are considered. This increase in the negative value of the coefficient presumably results from the removal of a large number of young males who have not married because they were continuing their education. The positive coefficient of +.033 for the 40-50 age class is changed to the negative value of -- .009 when ever-married males only are considered, but this coefficient remains nonsignificant at the .05 level. The coefficients of all the age classes over 50 years remain negative and nonsignificant whether or not the never-married males are included.

Inclusion or omission of the nevermarried persons, therefore, changes only slightly the relation between fertility and level of education in the older age classes. For all ages over 50 years the coefficients of correlation between number of children and years of education of the females are negative and significant at the .05 level or better, both for those ever married and for the total sample, including those never married. The coefficients of the males aged above 30 years are nonsignificant at the .05 level, both for those ever married and for the total sample.
DISCUSSION
Analysis of the relation between fertility and amount of education is made difficult by the variation which occurs among the age classes in both these attributes. Many of the younger males and females in the sample, for example, had not yet completed their families and some of them had not yet completed their education.
Those males and females who leave school early in life will be expected to marry sooner on the average and to begin their families at a younger age than those persons who remain longer in school. Although the better educated males and females may consequently be older when they begin their families, they may continue to produce children to an older age than those persons who have a lesser amount of education. In other words, the families of the better educated persons will be produced later in life, but may not necessarily be smaller in completed size than the families of the more poorly educated persons (Grabill, Riser, and Whelpton, 1958: 387).
The hypothesis that those males and females who leave school with relatively small amounts of education begin their

families earlier in life than those who continue longer in school is consistent with our measurements of the Ann Arbor population. The coefficients of correlation between number of children and years of education are negative for those males and females in the sample aged 30 years and younger. The coefficient is -- .100 and nonsignificant at the .05 level for the males and is --.339 and significant at the .001 level for the females (Table 4). The males of the 40-50 and 50-60 age classes and the females of the 30-40 and 40-50 classes, on the other hand, exhibit positive, though nonsignificant coefficients. The older age classes, both of the males and of the females, again exhibit negative coefficients, which are significant at the .05 level or better for the females but nonsignificant for the males. This variation among the age classes in the relation between fertility and amount of education conforms in general to the postulated differences between the educated classes in the age of family production. The females, however, exhibit this effect much more strongly than the males.
Because of the postulated variation among the educational classes in the age of family production, the correlations between number of children and level of education in the younger age classes may give erroneous indications. This difficulty has been in part avoided by those investigators who have considered only completed families. The families of females will be essentially complete by the age of 45 years. The age when the families of males are complete is not so sharply defined, and a few males may continue to produce children up to the age of 60 or older.
Natural fertility decreases with age, especially among females. Late-family production by the better educated persons

may consequently result in a lowering of the fertility of the more educated classes (Lorimer and Osborn, 1934: 321-325). Further, the lengthening of the time between generations resulting from late marriage will decrease the effective reproductive rate per century. In this report, however, we will not attempt to measure either of these possible effects of late marriage.
A decrease in the mean number of children per family was in progress in the United States in the early years of the present century (Westoff, 1954). In conformity with this trend, the means for the number of children of the males and of the females in the sample aged 60 years and older are mostly larger than the means for those in the younger age classes (Table 3). According to cohort fertility analyses by Whelpton, however, the cohorts beginning with those of 1910-14 initiated a reversal in the long-time trend toward smaller families. The relation between fertility and level of education in our sample may have been affected by these changes in family size. Our data, however, are inadequate to demonstrate any significant age variation in the Ann Arbor population in the relation between number of children and amount of education.
The economic depression of the 1930's is another factor that may have caused variation among the age classes in the relation between fertility and education. The mean number of children per person in the adjusted sample is smaller in the 40-50 age class of females and in the 50-60 class of males than in the preceding or following age classes (Table 3). Those females who were in the 40-50 age class when our sample was taken in 1951-54 would have been between 16 and 29 years old during the depression years 1930-39. Likewise, the

males in the 50-60 class would have been 26-39 years old during this period. These ages would be expected to be very fertile ones for females and for males, respectively. The low fertility of these particular age classes suggests, therefore, an effect of the depression on the production of children.
If the postulated lowering of fertility in the Ann Arbor population during the depression of the 1930's was greater for the persons in the lower educational levels than for those who were better educated, and who consequently may have been financially more secure, this might have affected the relation between fertility and education in the age classes concerned. The numbers of persons represented in the sample by the several age classes and educational levels, however, are too few for a critical test of this possibility.
The variation among the age classes in the relation between fertility and level of education, some of which may be due to differences among the educational classes in the age of family production, progressive changes in the pattern of family size, fluctuations in economic conditions, or changes in other socioeconomic factors, requires that comparisons of these relationships be restricted within narrow age limits. In our analyses we have consequently in general limited comparisons to within the 10-year age classes.
Level of education appears to be a good indicator of intelligence among adult males. Intelligence test scores in samples of males correlate over +.70 with amount of schooling (Anastasi, 1959). Some degree of positive correlation between intelligence and amount of schooling may be assumed to occur also among females. At least those females

who graduate from college must possess intelligence which is above average.
Many of the characters measured by intelligence tests are based in part on heredity. For nearly every one of numerous measures of intelligence and aptitude the scores of identical twins are more similar than are those of nonidentical but like-sexed twins (Strandskov, 1955; Vandenberg, 1962). The level of education achieved by each person, therefore, must be controlled in part by his inherited abilities.
Unfortunate traits of personality may prevent some young people from continuing their education until their full intellectual potentialities have been achieved. Personality traits that may be assumed to contribute to achievement in school as well as to success in later life include imagination, perseverence, dependabilty, curiosity, and social cooperativeness (Cattell, 1957). Reliable psychometric measures for the several elements of personality, unfortunately, are largely lacking. Some important features of personality, however, are known to have in part an hereditary basis (Cattell, 1950).
Although educational achievement cannot be assumed to be a fully accurate measure of inherited ability or of desirable features of personality, it is a useful index of both. The amount of ability which a person inherits sets a limit to the level of education he can attain. The progress that a student makes in school also is a good indicator of whether or not he possesses those personality traits which will enable him to adjust to and to succeed in a modern society.
The males in the population of Ann Arbor are indicated by our sample to have exhibited in the years 1951-54 a generally neutral correlation between fertility and amount of education.

Although their coefficients of correlation between number of children and years of schooling are negative for the age classes 60-70 and 70+, when their families can be considered to have been essentially complete, these coefficients are small and nonsignificant at the 5 percent level. The coefficients for the 4050 and 50-60 age classes are positive, while those for the 30- and 30-40 age classes are negative. The coefficients for the several age classes of the males thus are not consistently negative or positive, all are small, and all are nonsignificant at the 5 percent level (Table 4). The relation between fertility and level of education in our sample, therefore, gives no evidence of a significant genetic trend in ability, either dysgenic or eugenic, in the male population of Ann Arbor during the years 1951-54.
The females in the sample under 50 years old also provide no good evidence for either a negative or a positive genetic trend in ability. The 30- age class, it is true, exhibits a significant negative coefficient of correlation between number of children and years of schooling (Table 4). This negative correlation, however, is probably produced in large part by those females who marry and begin their families at a young age usually terminating their schooling sooner than those who marry at an older age or who never marry. The small but nonsignificant positive correlation in the 30-40 age class may then be due in part to a later age of family production by the better educated than by the more poorly educated females. A small but nonsignificant positive correlation, however, also occurs in the 40-50 age class, when the families of the females should mostly have been complete. This positive correlation in the 40-50 age class may represent in part a differential flue-

tuation in fertility resulting from economic depression of the 1930's or may be only a random variation. Our sample gives, therefore, no convincing evidence of a significant correlation between fertility and level of education in 1951-54 in that part of the female population of Ann Arbor under 50 years old.
The significant negative correlations between number of children and years of education exhibited by all the age classes over 50 years of the females in the sample might be assumed to indicate that a dysgenic trend in inherited ability had been operating in the female population of Ann Arbor during at least some of the decades prior to 1950. Even when those women who had never married are excluded, the coefficients are still negative and significant at the 5 percent level. In the years when these older females were growing up, however, advanced education was not so common for women as it is today. The schooling of a woman, moreover, usually is terminated when she marries, while men often continue their education after marriage, especially those who are enrolled in graduate or professional schools. The measure of ability given by number of years of schooling, therefore, is evidently not so reliable for females as for males. No measures of the actual correlation between intelligence test scores and years of schooling appear to be available for any large samples of women. This lack of information about the relation among women between intelligence and years of schooling makes it impossible for us to conclude that a dysgenic trend in inherited ability actually did occur in the recent past in the female population of Ann Arbor, but neither is this possibility ruled out.
We conclude that the relation between fertility and level of education in our

-¡sample provides no significant evidence ' for either a dysgenic or an eugenic trend
of inherited ability or of desirable inherited features of personality in the male or female population of Ann Arbor during the years 1951-54. The age classes of those females aged 50 years and older, it is true, exhibit significant negative correlations between number of children and years of schooling. The lack of information concerning the relation between intelligence test scores and years of schooling among females, however, makes the genetic significance of these negative correlations uncertain.
The failure of this study to demonstrate in the population of Ann Arbor the dysgenic relation between fertility and level of education reported for other populations by previous investigators may be due in part to the dependence of most previous studies on the fertility relations exhibited by the females only. A strong positive correlation between intelligence and amount of schooling has been shown to hold for males, but so far has not been demonstrated for females. Also, our sample includes the single as well as the married persons, while most previous studies have been based on the currently married persons only. Because marriage usually terminates the formal education of a woman, the relation of fertility to the level of education achieved by the married women in a population may not give a reliable indication of the genetic trend of ability.
Part of the difference between our results and those of previous investigators may be due to actual differences in the relation between fertility and level of education in the population of Ann Arbor from these relations in the populations previously studied. Earlier in this report we have pointed out that Ann

Arbor differs from certain neighboring cities in its low ratio of adult males to females and in its high proportion of well educated persons. Both these factors might affect the relation between fertility and education. From the information available, however, we are unable to compare critically the relation between fertility and education in Ann Arbor with that in any other population.
Changes are currently in progress in most human populations in the pattern of family size and in the levels of education attained by the males and by the females. Variations in both these attributes actually occur among the age classes represented in our sample. The relations between fertility and level of education exhibited by the population of Ann Arbor in 1951-54, therefore, undoubtedly differ in certain respects from those which existed in the previous generations and also from those which will occur in future generations.
SUMMARY
Information about number of children and years of education was secured from a two-stage random sample taken in 1951-54 of the resident population of Ann Arbor, Michigan. The sample consisted of 545 males aged 18 years and older and of 546 females aged 17 years and older. This was approximately a 4.2 percent sample of the adult, resident population of the city. Ascertainment was complete for the number of children of 99.1 percent of the males and of 98.9 percent of the females and for the number of years of education of 98.0 percent of the males and of 96.5 percent of the females included in the sample, as adjusted for over-representation of single males.
In that part of the population of Ann Arbor aged 30 years and older, 32.0 per-

cent of the males and 19.7 percent of the females are estimated to have graduated from college.
A greater proportion of the females who had graduated from college had never married than of those with less education. In the males, on the contrary, the relation between level of education and marriage is generally positive.
The greatest number of children reported by any male in the sample is 8 and by any female is 12. The 60-70 age class had produced the greatest mean number of children per person, 2.29 by the males and 2.22 by the females.
Part of the variation which occurs among the 10-year age classes in the relation of fertility to level of education may be due to differences in the age of family production by persons with differing amounts of education. Part of this variation may also be due to changing patterns of family size and to fluctuations in economic conditions over the past decades.
The coefficients of correlation between number of children and years of schooling for the males in the adjusted sample range in the several age classes from -- .100 to +.033 and all are nonsignificant at the 5 percent level. The coefficients for the younger females range from --.339 and significant at the .001 level for the 30- age class to +.016 and + .018 and nonsignificant at the .05 level for the 30-40 and 40-50 age classes, respectively. For the age classes of the females aged 50 years and older, the coefficients range from --.254 to --.354, and all are significant at the .05 to .01 levels.
Omission of the never-married persons from the computations produces no significant change in the coefficients for

44

the ageclasses older than 50 years, either for the males or for the females.
Insofar as the level of education achieved byeach person measures his inherited ability or desirable inherited features of personality, the sample furnishes no convincing evidence for either a dysgenic or an eugenic trend in the age classes represented in 1951-54 in the male population ofAnn Arbor or in that part of the female population under 50 years of age.
The significant negative coefficients of correlation between number of children and years of schooling exhibited by all the age classes of the females 50 years and older suggest that a dysgenic trend of ability mayhave existed in the female population of Ann Arbor during the decades prior to 1950. Because of the lack of information about the relation between intelligence test scores and years of schooling among women, however,the genetic significance of these negativecoefficients is uncertain.
