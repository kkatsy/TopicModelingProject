JEWISH FERTILITY IN THE UNITED STATES*

B,JIRTHS, deaths and migrations are the
basic factors of every human society. During the 19th century the population growth of the United States was influenced by immigration as well as by the surplus of births over deaths, but since the cessation of mass migration in the early 1920's the balance of births over deaths has been the dominant force in the growth of the American people.1 The Jewish group in the United States has fully shared in this change and for nearly 40 years now has not been able to rely on immigration as a prime source of growth. It is the purpose of this report to examine the natural growth of the Jewish population of the United States in recent years.
A number of recent nationwide sample surveys make it possible to analyze the current fertility pattern of the Jewish population, to compare it with patterns of other groups, and to examine some of the factors responsible for the specific fertility of the Jewish population. Earlier descriptions and analyses of the natural growth of the Jewish population, while useful and valuable, were deficient in three respects: they were confined to local communities; they were not designed for the measurement of natural growth and only rarely analyzed it, and they lacked comparability with non-Jewish groups.

CURRENT JEWISH FERTILITY PATTERN
Nature of the Data
Our description of the current fertility pattern of the Jewish population is based on the results of a nationwide sample survey by the U.S. Bureau of the Census in March 1957 of 35,000 households. Some of the statistical data concerning the religious composition of the American people were published by the bureau under the title, "Religion Reported by the Civilian Population of the United States: March 1957."2 Since survey results are seriously affected by the way questions are worded and by the nature of the inquiry, it should be emphasized that the Census Bureau's question was "What is your religion?" and that answers were voluntary. (Only 1 per cent of the sample population refused to reply.) The question was designed to elicit a respondent's religious preference or background, rather than church or synagogue membership and attendance, or religious belief. Because Jewish self-identification and identification by others is not based solely on religious adherence to Judaism, but also refers to culture, ancestry, and family background as well, we may reasonably assume that the Census Bureau's question was answered in Jewish terms even by persons not religious in any precise sense.

The Census Bureau's question did not differ from the one customarily used by Jewish communal agencies. It therefore came as no surprise that the sample census confirmed the Jewish population in the United States to be close to 5 million, a figure which had been arrived at independently through a variety of private surveys.8
Age Distribution
"What is your religion?" was asked only of persons 14 years old and over, "because some religious groups regard baptized infants as members and others count only persons who have 'joined* at

about 12 to 14 years of age or older. This difference would undoubtedly affect the replies for persons under 14."4 However, the sample survey did enumerate the population under 14 years of age, and a tabulation of this child population by religion of parents was presented. It was thus possible to obtain a complete picture of the age composition of the various religious groups. What was published about the children did not include data on sex, so this writer arbitrarily assigned one-half of the children to either sex. In Table 1 and Figure 1 the age composition of the Jewish population has been compared with that of the white

Protestant population. Because a separate tabulation for nonwhite Roman Catholics wasnot available, the Roman Catholic figure includes 774,000 nonwhites.
This tabulation reveals that the Jews in the United States did not participate in the postwar "baby boom" as much as the Roman Catholics and Protestants. Children under 14 years of age constituted 27.7per cent of Roman Catholics

and 26.7 per cent of white Protestants, but only 22.2 per cent of Jews. Thus, in the 14years between 1943 and 1957 Jewish fertility was 80.1 and83.1 percent of Catholic and Protestant fertility, respectively.
The child population in Table 1includes only children living in households where the parents adhered to a common religion. However, thesample survey indicated that there were about 4 million

additional children from religiously mixed marriages. The writer has arbitrarily allocated such children to the religion of their mothers and added them to the child populations of the appropriate religious groups in order to determine whether this addition effectively changes the relationship between the fertility pattern of the Jewish population and that of each of the other two groups. From Table 2 and Figure 2 it appears that with inclusion of children from mixed marriages, there is a possibility

that the fertility of the Jewish population was as little as 73.6 per cent of the Roman Catholic and 79.5 per cent of the white Protestant fertilities between 1943 and 1957.
While there is no other study available which compares the age distribution of the three religious groups for the country as a whole, a 1952 sample survey of New York City, by the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York (HIP), found that in New York youths under 15 years of age constituted 23 per cent of the Jew-

ish, 22.2 per cent of the white Protestant, and 27.4 per cent of the white Catholic populations.8 Comparing these figures with those in Table 2, we see that the proportions of youth in the Jewish population of NewYork City and of the country as a whole are nearly identical, and of those in the Catholic population very similar. That the proportion of white Protestant youth is somewhat smaller in New York City than in the country as a whole is probably due to the greater de-

gree of suburbanization of white Protestants in 1952.
Fertility Differences by Religion
The difference in relative sizes of youth populations is the first indication that each group has a distinctive fertility pattern. Further and more direct evidence is provided in Table 3, which relates fertility--measured by the number of children ever born per 1,000 women ever married--with a religious affiliation. The

evidence is that the differential between the fertility of the Jewish population and that of the other major denominations was not limited to the 14 years before 1957 but extends much farther back. For the childbearing age (15 to 44) the fertility of Jewish wives was 78.8 per cent of that of (white and nonwhite) Protestant wives and 76.6 per cent of that of (white and nonwhite) Roman Catholic wives. The age group beyond the childbearing age (45 years and over) showed a similar pattern: the fertility of Jewish wives was 80.6 and 72.6 per cent, respectively, of those of Protestant and Roman Catholic wives. Of the two sets of data the set for the completed fertility period (45 years old and over) is the more significant, since the differences recorded for the women still of an age to bear children were influenced by differences in age at marriage, child spacing, and similar factors. The most significant fact revealed by Table 3 is that the fertility of the Jewish women has lagged behind for two generations.
The table also reveals that fertility patterns are not permanent, but are subject to change over time. Comparing the Jewish with the Protestant group, we see that the difference in incomplete or current fertility was greater (21.2 per cent) than in completed fertility (19.4 per cent). The opposite relationship holds

true in a comparison of the Jewish with the Roman Catholic group, where the difference in current fertility was smaller (23.4 per cent) than in completed fertility (27.4 per cent).
Further, there are considerable variations of fertility patterns within each group at a given point in time, as shown in Table 4. Among Protestants, Baptists are the most fertile group. Their current and completed fertilities are 6 and 11 per cent, respectively, higher than the average for the country as a whole. Lutherans and Presbyterians are the least fertile Protestant groups recorded. The completed fertility of the Presbyterians is 1 per cent below that of the Jews. The above-average fertility of the Baptists has been attributed to two factors: the first, that about one-third of the Baptists are Negroes, whose fertility is considerably higher than that of whites, and the second, that a large number of white Baptists are rural. By contrast, the low fertility of the Presbyterians has been attributed to urban residence, combined with a high level of education, occupation, and income.6
That the Jewish fertility rate is shared or approached by one or two Protestant denominations is a first indication that there may be nothing "inherently Jewish" about it.

tility in the United States has been observed before, though in a fragmentary manner. Goldberg's findings were limited to the fertility of married women who reported Yiddish as their mother tongue in the 1940 census.7 More recently for 13 communities surveyed between 1947 and 1950, Seligman found that in each the fertility of the Jewish population was lower than that of the total white population.8
SOCIAL DETERMINANTS
It has been know for a long time that different social groups have different fertilities. Size of community (degree of urbanization), home ownership, education, occupation, and income have been found to be key factors. The evidence indicates that racial, ethnic, and religious factors are of secondary importance. Within any religious, ethnic, or racial group there is considerable variation in fertility, depending upon place of residence, home ownership, education, occupation, and income. Conversely, members of different religious groups who are alike in residence, education, occupation, and income display a virtually identical pattern of fertility. The latter forces must therefore be regarded as the basic determinants of variations in fertility.9

Residence
Urban-rural difference in fertility is among the oldest and best known of demographic phenomena. The main reasons for the difference are most likely to be found in the greater financial cost and physical difficulty of raising children in an urban environment.10 In the United States urban fertility seems to have been two-thirds of rural fertility as early as 1810. By 1940 urban fertility had dropped to 56 per cent of the rural rate, but it rose to 71 per cent in 1950.11
"Urban" refers to places with a population of only 2,500 as well as to cities with more than a million. Within the urban category, the larger the size of a community, the lower the fertility. This inverse relationship was last observed for the United States in the 1950 population census, which found that the fertility ratio in cities with more than three million inhabitants was only 85 per cent of that in cities with fewer than 250,000.12
In these respects, the most outstanding characteristic of the Jewish population and the one that distinguishes it most from the other major religious groups is its heavy concentration in cities. Table 5 reveals that in 1957,96.1 per cent of the Jews resided in cities, as compared with

78.8 per cent of the Roman Catholics and 55.2 per cent of the white Protestants. Furthermore, Jews are concentrated in the larger cities, 87.4 per cent living in "urbanized areas" of 250,000 or more persons, as compared with 53.9 per cent of the Roman Catholics and 24.5 per cent of the white Protestants.13 Even this fails

to indicate fully the degree of Jewish urbanization. Further analysis, as in Table 6, leads to the conclusion that at least 86.6 per cent of all Jews in the United States actually reside in urbanized areas with 750,000 or more inhabitants.

Opinion Research Center, in 1953 and 1955, which found that 84 per cent of the Jews of the United States live in "standard metropolitan areas" with a population of a million or more.14 What is more, 52.3 per cent reside in the largest urban agglomeration, the New York area, and 65.8 per cent live in urbanized areas with more than three million residents (Table 6).
Other things being equal, one should reasonably expect that the fertility of the Jewish population as a whole would be closer to that prevailing among all whites in large cities than to any other. This

expectation is borne out. Part A of Table 7 shows that Jewish fertility is, indeed, closer to the urban white than to the other three fertilities. While the current Jewish rate is 11 points lower and the completed rate 10 points lower than the respective urban white rates, they are both 21 points below those of the nation as a whole.
Part B of Table 7 shows that with increasing intensity of urbanization the fertility rate declines progressively, but that the current Jewish fertility is 6 points below the rate that prevails in even the most intensively urbanized

«Most returns of the 1957 sample survey were standardized for age in order to reduce "the effect

of intergroup differences in the distribution by age." (For details see source above, pp. 5,6.) Since

returns for the Jewish population were not large enough to permit standardization, the unstand-

areas. Since about half of the Jews of the United States live in the New York area, which in 1950 had a population of over 12 million, and two-thirds live in urbanized areas of 3 million and more, one can justify the conclusion that residence is the most significant factor in the low Jewish fertility. Other factors are examined below.
Educational Attainment of Women
The relationship of women's education to fertility is twofold: while prolonged education depresses women's fertility very considerably, the gains in fertility since 1940 have been most pronounced among women of the highest educational attainment. As shown in Table 8, the fertility of women college graduates was only about half of the fertility of all American women. This was true for the United States as a whole in 1940, 1950, and probably in 1957.15 It will also be seen from Table 8, however, that the fertility of urban college graduates rose from 52 per cent of the fertility of all urban white women in 1940 to 61 per cent in 1950,18 and from Part C of Table 7 that the gain continued in

1957 for women of childbearing age. While for women past the childbearing age (45 and over) the inverse relationship between fertility and education was as clear in 1957 as in 1950 and 1940, for women of childbearing age (15 to 44) the inverse relationship became blurred.
Table 7 shows that the cumulative fertility rate of urban women 15 to 44 years old with four years or more of college was 1,746, while the rate for all Jewish women of that age was 1,749. The similarity calls for an examination of the educational attainment of Jewish women.
Table 9 shows that in 1950, 6 per cent of the total population--including both sexes and all races--had had 4 years of college or had also had graduate education. By 1957 the proportion had risen to 7.5 per cent. The percentage of women achieving this educational level rose from 5 per cent in 1950 to 5.7 per cent in 1957.
Table 10, showing the percentage of such women in each of six cities where the Jewish population is concentrated, shows that between large cities the intensity of urbanization does not significantly affect the length of school attendanee for women. In Philadelphia, the

fourth largest city in the United States, only 3.3 per cent of white women 25 years old and over were college graduates, while in San Francisco, the seventh largest city, 7.4 per cent were college graduates.
Although there have been no specific studies of the educational achievement of Jewish women, two recent surveys, one of Washington, D. C. and the other of San Francisco, have provided some material, summarized in Table 11, on the basis of which a tentative conclusion may be essayed:17 that the ratio of Jewish women who have graduated from college is almost double that of the total white female population. Washington may be unrepresentative, because the large proportion of women college graduates there could be due to the peculiarity of job opportunities in the capital, but the roughly 2-to-l ratio of Jewish to all white women college graduates obtains in San Francisco as well. The conclusion seems justified that the educational level of Jewish women of childbearing age is comparatively high, and does have a significant effect upon their fertility.
Husband's Occupation
That occupational groups differ considerably in their reproductivity is a fact which has aroused considerable curiosity and anxiety.18 White-collar workers have fewer children than manual workers and rural residents. (This differential was observed for rural farm, rural nonfarm, and urban areas in 1940 and 1950.)19 Table 12 shows that the wives of white-collar workers of childbearing age have up to 20 per cent fewer children than the national average, while such women past the childbearing age have had up to 30 per cent fewer children than the national average.

white-collar groups is a social determinant of great weight in the specific fertility pattern of the Jewish population. Next to urban residence, the second most distinctive sociological attribute of American Jews is their concentration in the white-collar occupations. Community surveys in the late 30's indicated that an average of 76.8 per cent of Jews in the labor force were professional workers, managers, officials and proprietors, and clerical and sales workers.20 Similar surveys in the late 1940's showed that 84.2

per cent were so employed.21 Data from national surveys now show that the heavy concentration of Jews in white-collar occupations holds true for the country as a whole. It will be seen from Table 13 that between 1953 and 1955, 78.2 per cent of Jewish heads of households were employed in the four categories comprising the white-collar group, with a concentration of "managers, officials, proprietors" and "sales workers." In each of these categories the proportion of Jews was about three times that of the na-

tional average. Again the conclusion must be drawn that the occupational distribution of American Jews depresses their fertility. The 12 per cent of Jewish household heads who were manual workers ("operatives and kindred workers") might be expected to show greater fertility, but they do not. They are most likely to reside in New York, according to a finding that 28 per cent of the Jewish labor force of that city are skilled and unskilled workers.22 A recent survey of the ninth grade of a Brooklyn, N.Y., junior high school found that there was virtually no difference between Jewish manual and white-collar workers in the size of the family. The average number of children for the white-collar worker was 2.28, that for manual workers 2.32.23 Admittedly limited, the study allows the inference that for the Jewish population of New York City, occupation does not affect fertility differentials.
This startling propensity of Jewish manual workers to behave like whitecollar people in the distinctive and crucial respect of fertility can at least be reconciled with, if not fully explained by, Glazer's conclusion that Jews in the United States have tended to have middle-class values--sobriety, foresight, etc. --even when earning a living as manual workers.24
Huband's Income and Family Income
The collection of income data by the Bureau of the Census was started on a limited basis in connection with the 1940 census. Since then, many sample surveys as well as the 1950 census not only have built up a continuous record of the income of Americans but have also made it possible to relate size of income to a number of social and physical characteristics. The 1950 census returns were analyzed in a monograph by Herman P. Miller,

who found that incomes tend to increase with size of city, length of education, proximity to the apex of professional status, and increasing age up to 54 years. Nearly all of these factors help explain the relatively high income of the Jewish population.25
As a result of the concentration of the Jewish labor force in white-collar fields in the largest urban centers, the median family income of Jewish households is higher than that of the combined membership of Protestant denominations and of Roman Catholics. The Bureau of the Census does not publish income data for the various religious denominations, but sample surveys by the National Opinion Research Center in 1953 and 1955 found that the median family income of Jewish households was $5,954, that of Protestant households $3,933, and that of Roman Catholic households $4,340.28
Bogue concludes that "income differentials between religions tend to disappear and become simply differentials between occupations."27
If income is such a close correlate of occupation, one should expect an inverse relationship between income and fertility. Most empirical studies have found this to be so, except for the highest-income group, which has a higher level of fertility. The pattern is that of a "Jshaped relation of fertility with economic status."28
The excess of total family income over husband's income is most likely to come from the wife's earnings, at the cost of limiting her fertility. Part D of Table 7 shows that urban, married women in the labor force, 15 to 44, have only 69 per cent as many children as women of their age not in the labor force, and women 45 and over only 77 per cent.
Table 14 shows that the one exception to the inverse relationship between

family income and fertility is in the highest income--$7,000 and over--for women 45 and older. The inverse relationship between husband's income and fertility holds true for all income groups for women past the childbearing age. However, for women of childbearing age the inverse relationship holds true only for incomes up to $5,000, after which fertility rises. Nevertheless, a comparison of the 1957 data of Table 14 with a similar set of data gathered in 1952 shows, during the 5-year interval, "a strong pattern of relatively more children among people with little income than among people with more income."29 Since the Jews are concentrated in white-collar occupations, which typically bring greater financial rewards, the conclusion must be drawn that the income factor contributes its share toward depressing the level of Jewish fertility.
Jewishness as a Determinant of Fertility Our step-by-step analysis of the data
would make it appear that the religiocultural complex called Jewishness is not,

as has been often theorized, a major factor in the Jewish fertility rate.
Goldberg has repeatedly advanced the thesis that the low level of fertility among the Jews in the United States is due to their status as a minority group.30 He maintains that because of discriminatory practices, Jews require more éducation, training, and experience than non-Jews to achieve comparable positions. According to Goldberg, minority status affects Jewish fertility in two ways: it defers marriage, and it keeps children dependent on their parents for a longer period of time because of the need for more intensive preparation for adult careers.
To the extent that differences in fertility levels have here been explained by differences in rural-urban distribution, in the educational attainment of women, and in husbands' occupation and income, Goldberg's thesis is unsupported. Bogue asserts:
The meager data available gives little evidence either that any religious group is extraordinarily favored, or that there is severe discrimination (independent of any other

212 Rosenthal

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:26 08 December 2015

factors) against any religious group because of its beliefs--with respect to broad categories of occupational attainment. Although the religious groups differ substantially with respect to occupational composition, in general the members of each religion seem to be located just about as high on the occupational ladder as the level of their educational attainment would lead one to expect.31
For Bogue it is clear that education and occupation are "much more potent factors than religious preference in determining the income level of households.'^2
Though the low level of Jewish fertility, accordingly, seems unrelated to discrimination, it may be related to rapid upward social movement. American Jews have successfully tested the promise of an open, democratic society. Glazer found that the "rise in the social and economic position of the Jews has been extremely rapid, far surpassing that which can be shown for any other immigrant group, and indeed surpassing, for the same period, changes in the socio-economic position of long-settled groups."33 There is some evidence available that the class composition of the Jewish population had approached that of Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians 10 years ago and even earlier. Twenty-two per cent of the Jews were in the upper class, 32 per cent in the middle class, and 46 per cent in the lower, while the corresponding figures for the Presbyterians were 22, 40, and 38 per cent.34
A relationship between low fertility and rapid social mobility has been postulated in the theory of social capillarity, according to which a family must be small if it is to rise in the social scale.35 The Princeton Fertility Study is the first to reveal empirically the operation of social capillarity in the Jewish case, finding that a major factor governing the fertility behavior of the Jewish couples

in the sample survey was "a perceived incompatibility between sending children to college and having large families."36 Low fertility, therefore, has been an important means for rising in the social and economic scale for Jews. Another means has been moving to desirable residential areas.37
JEWISH FERTILITY IN CANADA AND
GREAT BRITAIN
Low fertility is not limited to the Jews of the United States. The fertility of Canadian Jews is considerably lower than that of the Canadian population as a whole. While the fertility rate of all married women 15 to 49 years old was 168.7 per 1,000 in 1951, the corresponding Jewish rate was only 114.2, or 67.6 per cent as high; in the same year the average size of the Jewish family was 3.2, compared with 3.7 for all Canadian families. The average Jewish family "was the smallest of any among the eight largest groups in Canada."38 The low fertility of the Jews in Canada is not recent. As early as 1926 the Jewish birth rate was only 70 per cent of that of the total population.39 A detailed study of the fertility patterns and trends among Jews of Canada between 1931 and 1941 found that the Jewish concentration in urban centers and in white-collar occupations contributed to low fertility.40
In Great Britain official statistics do not include data on religious preference or origin, and the demographer must therefore rely on local community surveys and nongovernmental sample surveys. Analysis of the available studies indicates that the Jewish birth rate has lagged considerably behind. The estimated Jewish birth rate for the period 1945-49 was 11.6 per thousand, compared with 16.8 for the total population in the same period.41

FAMILY LIMITATION: ATTITUDES
AND PRACTICES
The significance of the 1957 sample survey of the U. S. Bureau of the Census for Jewish demography is matched by two recent studies of attitudes toward family planning. The first, the Growth of American Families (GAF) study, was by Ronald Freedman of the Survey Research Center of the University of Michigan and P. K. Whelpton and A. A. Campbell of the Scripps Foundation for Research in Population Problems.42 The second, the Princeton Fertility Study (PFS), was conducted by the Office of Population Research, Princeton;43 Some of the findings of the Princeton Fertility Study cited below were taken from a published paper by Charles F. Westoff and an unpublished paper by Robert G. Potter, Jr.44
The GAF study found that Jewish couples "expect significantly fewer children (2.4) than either Catholics (3.4) or Protestants (2.9)." In the 12 largest cities included in the GAF sample, Jews and Protestants expected the same average number of births (2.3). The authors therefore attribute the low fertility expectation of the Jewish families primarily to their concentration in large cities.45 Their low expectations are realized because, as the Princeton study found, consensus about the number of children wanted was greatest among Jewish couples.46
The GAF study found that Jewish wives were most favorably inclined toward family limitation--88 per cent expressing unqualified approval, compared with 33 per cent for Catholic and 72 per cent for Protestant wives.47 A smaller study suggests that comparable differences in attitude exist before marriage, as well. In a group of 222 unmarried

women undergraduates between 18 and 23 it was found that 85 per cent of the Jewish women "would consider the use of contraceptives," 58 per cent of the Protestants, and 18 per cent of the Catholics.48
Accordingly, the GAF study found that Jews practiced contraception more than the other two groups.49 Both the GAF and the Princeton studies found that Jewish couples were much more likely to begin contraception at the time of marriage.50 Of the variety of birth-control techniques available, Jews used the most effective ones.51 As a consequence, "Jews are much more likely than others to have Completely Planned Fertility."52 This was complemented by the Princeton finding that "the Jewish rate of contraceptive failure is less than half that of the other religious groups,"53 confirming that Jews are the most successful in family planning.54
Earlier studies had led to similar conclusions. A survey of family planning by patients in urban hospitals east of the Mississippi in the early 30's found a higher proportion of Jews than of others using contraceptive devices,55 and according to the records of a birth-control clinic in New York City around 1930, a higher proportion of Jewish couples planned pregnancies, used more effective birthcontrol methods, and used them earlier than couples of other religions.66
When Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish couples were recently matched for urban residence, husband's education and income, and wife's education, it was found that similarity of background factors produced a considerable degree of similarity in the fertility behavior of Protestants and Jews. However, this matching procedure failed to diminish the original differences between the Catholics and the other two groups.87

FUTURE JEWISH FERTILITY
In view of the low Jewish fertility rate the question must be raised whether past and current fertility levels are high enough to maintain the size of the Jewish population.
Natural Growth About 20 years ago the net reproduc-
tion rate was held to be the best device for measuring the growth of a population, but this measure, which treats current fertility and mortality as constants, has since been found inadequate for societies where birth rates are subject to rapid change.58 The absence of a specific mortality rate and the effects of intermarriage and of conversions from and to Judaism further complicate estimating a replacement rate for the Jewish population. Bogue's opinion that American Jews "are scarcely reproducing themselves"89 is supported by a calculation of replacement quotas by the Census Bureau in connection with the 1957 sample survey, which found that on the basis of current fertility and mortality levels, replacement of the white population required 2,130 live births per 1,000 women, single as well as married.60 While the fertility rate of 1,749 per 1,000 ever-married Jewish women of childbearing age is considerably lower, the hypothetical and static nature of that measure of replacement should be kept in mind.
It appears quite likely that in the future, Jewish fertility in the United States will continue to be influenced primarily by urban residence and concentration in the white-collar occupations, but will be modified by three new factors: the move to the suburbs, satisfaction of the status drive, and new goals of completely planned fertility.
Suburban Residence The depressive effect of urban resi-

dence upon Jewish fertility can be attributed to tenancy (rather than home ownership) and living in the central city. Fragmentary data indicate that Jews in the large urban centers lived in rental multiple-dwelling units rather than in homes of their own until the end of World War II.61 There are two wellknown drawbacks to rearing large families in either walk-up or elevator apartments. One is the considerable physical difficulty of caring for children on levels other than the ground floor.62 The other is the preference of landlords for tenants with few or no children.63 The author is aware of only one study where the differential effect of home tenure upon fertility was measured. A survey of Indianapolis in 1941 found "that fertility rates are consistently higher for owners than for renters when rental value of the home is held constant."64
Suburbs, on the other hand, have been very hospitable to small children and to large families. An analysis of the 1950 population census found that "as compared with the central-city population, the suburban population has a substantial excess of persons aged 0 to 4 and 5 to 13."63 Since the Jewish population ever since the end of World War II has been moving into city neighborhoods bordering on suburbs as well as into suburbs proper, and is continuing to do so, it is likely to adopt the higher fertility pattern prevalent there.66
Social Status
We have seen that the ambition to rise in the social and economic scale was fulfilled in a relatively brief time, but was probably accomplished at the cost of considerable restriction of fertility. Now that many Jews have achieved this goal or can be confident of moving toward it without encountering major

obstacles, it is conceivable that Jewish fertility will rise. Independently of religious or ethnic factors, in Philadelphia it has been found that people who have achieved their class position themselves have fewer children, on the average, than people who have inherited their position.67
Completely Planned Families
That Jews show a more positive attitude toward birth control than other groups and use birth-control methods more effectively could lead to the conclusion that fertility planning itself contributes to the low Jewish fertility in the United States. The following evidence shows that that conclusion may not be warranted.
As we have seen, most studies reveal an inverse relationship between income and fertility, which does not appear to hold for the highest income group. The Indianapolis Study--easily the most significant research project in demography in recent decades, and the first to succeed in sorting out couples by the degree of family planning they had exercised--found that for those couples who had planned their fertility most completely, in numbers and spacing of children, there was a direct rather than an inverse relationship between fertility and socioeconomic status: couples of higher socioeconomic status had a higher fertility than couples of lower status.68
Any prediction about the future fertility behavior of the Jewish population must take into account the GAF and Princeton findings that Jews tend markedly toward completely planned fertility. If our assumption of a direct relationship between rapid upward mobility and fertility restriction in the past is correct, it is possible that with further gains in social and economic status the Jewish fer-

tility level will rise. Freedman and his associates found that in response to the question of how many births could be expected for their families to be completed, Jewish couples gave an average number of 2.4. When asked how many children they would have if they could start life over again, Jewish couples gave an average of 3.1. This is also the number of children Jewish couples consider ideal for Americans.69
