THE ONEIDA COMMUNITY EXPERIMENT IN STIRPICULTURE *
HILDA HERRICK NOYES, M.D., and GEORGE WALLINGFORD NOYES, A.B.

The institution afterwards known as
the Oneida Community was founded by
John Humphrey Noyes at Putney, Ver-
mont, in 1841. In 1848 under pressure
of persecution the Community removed
to Oneida, New York, which at that
time was a frontier settlement. In its
new location the Community grew and
prospered until January 1, 1881, when,
for reasons which need not here be de-
tailed, it was reorganized as a joint-stock
company. Since that date the joint-stock
successor of the Community has carried
on its business with extraordinary suc-
cess, its net assets having increased
from about $550,000 in 1881 to nearly
$7,000,000 at the present time.
Noyes first published his views re-
garding human "stirpiculture," as he
called it, in the First Annual Report of
the Oneida Community in February
1849. He says:
We are not opposed to procreation. But we are opposed to involuntary procreation. We are opposed to excessive and, of course, oppressive procreation, which is almost universal. We are opposed to random procreation, which is unavoidable in the marriage system. But we are in favor of intelligent, well-ordered procreation. We believe the time will come when scientific combination will be applied to human generation as freely and successfully as it is to that of other animals.

The authors wish to express their appreciation for the assistance on the construction of the mortality tables given by Mr. Edwin W. Kopf, assistant statistician of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.

For 27 years after its foundation the Oneida Community was engaged in working out the immediate problems of its new order of society, and could not undertake an experiment in scientific propagation. But in 1868 it found itself in a situation favorable for such an experiment in the following respects:
1. A social system based on their religion, called "complex marriage," which, under stringent regulations and circumscribed by the limits and approval of the Community, permitted the requisite flexibility in mating.
2. Sufficient income. From 1841 until 1855 expenses exceeded income. After 1855 income exceeded expenses, and during the period 1868 to 1872 the net income above all expenses averaged more than $47,000 per year.
3. Sufficient number of members to admit a considerable degree of selection. The membership during the 11 years of the stirpicultural experiment ranged from 271 to 306, with a slight excess of women over men.
4. Capable leaders. Noyes himself was a graduate of Dartmouth College, had studied theology at Andover and Yale, and his management of the Community during 27 years had fully demonstrated his unusual ability. He was surrounded by a cabinet of men and women (among them a number of college graduates), who had shown the qualities of leadership in positions of high responsibility.
5. Confidence on the part of the members in their leaders and in the stability of the Community. The members were practically unanimous in believing

282

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:29 08 December 2015

that Noyes and his subordinate leaders were inspired and that the Community was the earthly representative of the Kingdom of God. Without this superlative confidence they would not have been willing to engage in such an experiment.
6. A method of subjective, healthful, reasonably effectual birth-control called "male continence," discovered by Noyes in 1844, which did not exclude from sexual communion those judged unfit to take part in the stirpicultural experiment.
7. A high degree of passional control due to the fact that discipline and effort had from the beginning been constantly directed toward perfection of character. In the early days no little trouble had been caused by jealously and exclusiveness, but by 1868 these anti-Communistic traits had been so far conquered that altruism deemed impossible in ordinary society was commonplace in the Community.
8. Extraordinary religious devotion. This characteristic made a large majority of the Community members fervently desirous not alone negatively to avoid selfishness, but positively to engage with all their powers in any enterprise which they thought in the interest of the Kingdom of God. Such pre-eminently was the enterprise of human redemption by "combining regeneration with scientific generation."
While the Community did not pretend to unusual knowledge of stirpiculture, the leaders nevertheless devoted much study to the literature of the subject, especially the works of Charles Darwin and Francis Galton. Noyes embodied the results of his studies in an article entitled "Scientific Propagation," which was published in The Modern

Thinker, August 1870, and later in pamphlet form.
Early in 1869 the young men and women of the Community made the following declarations:
Statement addressed to J. H. Noyes by young men
The undersigned desire you may feel that we most heartily sympathize with your purposes in regard to scientific propagation, and offer ourselves to be used in forming any combinations that may seem to you desirable. We claim no rights. We ask no privileges. We desire to be servants of the truth. With a prayer that the grace of God will help us in this resolution, we are your true soldiers,
(Signed by 38 young men.)
Resolutions of young women
1. That we do not belong to ourselves in any respect, but that we do belong first to God, and second to Mr. Noyes as God's true representative.
2. That we have no rights or personal feelings in regard to child-bearing which shall in the least degree oppose or embarrass him in his choice of scientific combinations.
3. That we will put aside all envy, childishness and self-seeking, and rejoice with those who are chosen candidates; that we will, if necessary, become martyrs to science, and cheerfully resign all desire to become mothers, if for any reason Mr. Noyes deem us unfit material for propagation. Above all, we offer ourselves "living sacrifices" to God and true Communism.
(Signed by 53 young women.)
The experiment which followed these declarations occupied the years 1868 to 1879 inclusive. About 100 men and

women took part, of whom 81 became

parents. During the 11 years 58 living

children were born, and there were four

still-births. A precise appraisal of the

factors entering into the experiment

and of its outcome must be the work of

scientific specialists, preferably those

wholly unconnected with the experi-

ment itself. The present paper at-

tempts only a brief, tentative account.

The Oneida Community was a prod-

uct of successive unconscious group se-

lections. To go no further back than

8. .

,

the English Puritans four such selections

°' . .

can bedistinguished:

°

1. The New England pioneers were a

selection from the English Puritans.

2. The Revivalists were a selection

from the New England pioneers.

3. The Perfectionists, comprising

those who believed in the possibility

and obligation of freedom from sin in

this world, were a selection from the

Revivalists.

4. The Oneida Communists, compris-

ing those who believed in the necessity

of human leadership as an auxiliary to

direct divine guidance, were a selection

from the Perfectionists.

Some of the resulting characteristics of

the Oneida Community group were the

following:

1. Hardiness. Until 1863 the Community members did the work of farm, factory and household with no hired help. They lived a pioneer life. The death-rate among them was only 72 percent of that in New York State total population, 1910. (See Table 1.)
2. Longevity. Survival until 80 years of age and beyond was common. Twenty-two died between the ages of 85 and 96.
3. Sufficient native ability to carry on successfully a diversified industry and

the complex social affairs of a Community.
4. Faculty of agreement. The members of the Community for 40 years achieved the miracle of unanimity in allimportant moves,

it may be further mentioned that two of thesuperintendents were also editors, that several of those otherwise classified were important contributors to the Community paper, and that eight of the 40 men were college graduates.

partments of human nature were developed to the fullest extent compatible with the above stated order of precedence. While the terms describing the four "departments of human nature" were not rigidly defined, they carry a meaning easily intelligible. Noye's own conception of them is stated in a "home talk" dated April 5, 1869, as follows:
Our nature is like a nest of four boxes. The inner one is the spiritual, the next is the intellectual, the next is the moral, and the outer one is the physical. God will begin to renew us by giving us ruggedness in the spirit, which will enable us to face all devils without fear and live in contact with them without contamination. Then he will give us ruggedness of the understanding, which fears no argument and overcomes all delusions. Then he

will give us ruggedness of the moral nature, which keeps its resolutions and submits to no condemnation. And finally through all these mediates he will give us ruggedness of physical health.
The direction of the experiment during the early years was in the hands of an informal committee consisting of the socalled "central members" of the Community, Noyes himself exercising the preponderating influence. On January 25, 1875, a formal "Stirpicultural Committee" composed of six men and six women, two of the members being graduates of the Yale Medical School and the others persons of exceptional experience and judgment, was appointed by the Community and placed in charge. The Stirpicultural Committee functioned for

286

Noyes and Noyes

about 15 months, or until April 20, 1876. After this the direction of the experiment passed again into the hands of the "central members" of the Community.
The general methods of selection are indicated by the records of the Stirpicultural Committee. In a majority of cases application was made to the committee by couples desiring to become parents, and the committee, after due consideration, would either approve or disapprove. If an application were disapproved, the committee would always interest itself in an attempt to find a combination agreeable to those concerned which it could approve. Occasionally the committee itself took the initiative in bringing about combinations which in their opinion were specially fit.
The degree of selection exercised by the committee may be judged from the following facts:
1. The death rate among the 81 selected parents was 22.5 percent less than that of the group as a whole. (Compare Tables 1and 3.)
2. The fathers of the stirpicultural children averaged 12.2 years older than the mothers. This indicated a certain amount of survival selection among the fathers, and accorded with the principle that quality of offspring is more dependent upon selection among fathers than among mothers.
3. During a typical period of about 15 months, out of 51 applications from men and women desiring to become parents, nine were vetoed on the ground of unfitness, and 42 were approved.
4. Exact statistics as to the number of combinations brought about by the initiative of the Committee are not available, but it is probable that about 25 percent of the births were of this character.
5. Although nearly as many fathers as

mothers were engaged in the experiment, 30 of the fathers had only one child each, while the remaining 10 had an average of 2.8 children each.
Children were cared for by their mothers during infancy. When able to walk, a child was admitted to the day nursery department of the "Children's House," the mother continuing the night care. From the beginning of the play stage until adolescence the Children's House had complete charge, though parents visited their children and received visits from them. Much attention was given to diet, clothing, sanitation and profitable activity, and since epidemic diseases common in outside society were vigilantly excluded, sickness among the children was rare. In case of sickness good medical attendance and the best of nursing were immediately available. There were also facilities for quarantine, night watchers, and appliances for comfort and convenience, such as few private families could afford. During the 40 years 1841 to 1880 inclusive, in which a total of 193 children were cared for, only five deaths occurred in the Children's House. At adolescence a young person graduated from the Children's House and took his place in the general organization of the Community.
At the reorganization of the Community as a joint-stock company on January 1, 1811, the provisions made for the women and children were these:
The women of the Community participated equally with the men in the distribution of assets in the form of stock, the general basis of division being a proportionate part of the property brought in and an allowance for each year of membership. Several of the mothers who did not immediately marry were given a small extra cash allowance so long as they remained unmarried.

Every child under two-and-a-half years of age received an annual appropriation of $200 in cash, until the age of two-anda-half wasreached.
Every child over two-and-a-half and under 16 years of age received an annual appropriation according to the profits of the Company, the minimum appropriation being $80 and the maximum $125 per year.
Every child upon reaching its sixteenth birthday received $200 in cash.
The Company obligated itself to maintain a suitable school for children under sixteen years of age free of charge.
The Company also agreed to give preference to the members of the former Community and their children in the matter of employment.

All these provisions were faithfully carried out by the new Company, and no cases of destitution among the women and children of the Community have ever occurred.
A general survey of the Oneida Community stirpicultural experiment will show the following outstanding results:
1. No mothers were lost during theexperiment, nor indeed during the entire career of the Community, from causes directly or indirectly due to childbirth.
2. No deaf and dumb, blind, crippled, or idiotic children were ever born in the Community.
3. In the group of 44 pre-stirpicultural children, born under the regime of birth control but not of parent selection, the death rate was 82.6 percent of that in the United States total population, 1870. (SeeTable 2.)

4. In the group of 58 stirpicultural children born during the period 18691879, six have died up to September 26, 1921. These six actual deaths represent 13.3 percent of the expected deaths in the United States total population, 1870. (See Table 4.)
5. The causes of the six actual deaths in the group of stirpicultural children were these:
Case 1. Age three days. Atelectasis after instrumental delivery.
Case 2. Age seven days. Scarlet fever contracted during a residence in a large city.
Case 3. Age 19 years. Brain tumor. Case 4. Age 39 years. Run over by a
railway train. Case 5. Age 44 years. Fall with aero-
plane while flying for the allies in France. Case 6. Age 45 years. Aortic Aneurism.
6. Among the 52 survivors of the 58 stirpicultural births, now at ages 41 to 51,

there are two cases of subnormal development. The first is a man 50 years of age, who has shown since birth a partial lack of muscular coordination, caused probably by cerebral hemorrhage during delivery. His mentality is normal, and his health, except for the defect noted, is good. He was for many years a foreman, and has always been able to support himself by his own labor. The second is a man 45 years of age, whose mental development was retarded at about the age of seven by an accidental blow on the head which left a permanent indentation on the cranium. Though still slightly subnormal mentally, he works hard on a farm and in a store, and enjoys reading. Physically he is well developed. Aside from these two, there are no cases of even partial incapacitation for the normal activities of life.
7. During the stirpicultural period a purposely increased birth rate coincided

with a marked fall in the death rate. (Compare Tables 2 and4.)
8. In the group of 98 children, one or both of whose parents* were stirpicultural, five actual deaths occurred during the period 1890-1920, representing 23.5 percent of the expected deaths in New York State total population 1910. (See Table 5.)
9. In the group of 28 children, both of whose parents were stirpicultural, no deaths have occurred during the period 1897 to 1920. In a group of equal size the number of expected deaths in New York State total population 1910 is 6.2. (See Table 6.)
1 Complex marriage was abandoned August 28, 1879, since which date the members of the Community have married as in ordinary society. Of the 55 stirpicultural children who reached marriageable age, 18 intermarried, 32 married outside the group, and 5 remained single. The results of the 50 marriages are shown in the text and in Tables 5 and 6.

* The Scandinavian method of computing the ratio of actual to expected mortality has been used in these tables rather than the method of computing the death rates per thousand as being more accurate for small groups. The death rates per thousand used in computing the expected deaths are given in the lower part of the table: Death rates per 1,000 at specified central ages of five year age groups. Population mortality tables used to test Oneida Community mortality data.
