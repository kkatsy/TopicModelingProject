PROFESSOR MERKULOV'S EXPERIMENTS

Novosti Press Agency (APN) Moscow, USSR

Professor Mikhail Merkulov, head of a chair at the Second Moscow Medical Institute, is studying the processes taking place in the cell and the laws of the process of the renewal of the organism. He believes that this research should provide the answer to the questions why the renewal process slows down with the years and whether this can be combatted by creating ideal conditions for the organism.
Professor Merkulov's laboratory is now trying to decode the behavior of the molecules of DNA, representing the cell's supervision center which contains the organism's hereditary traits. It has been established that DNA remains unchanged, whereas the rest of the parts surrounding it change many times. The researchers came up against an interesting phenomenon: it happens that some cell perishes but its DNA does not

disintegrate and may be absorbed by another healthy cell. Possibly this is a special form of renewal, for such a process is bound up with the division of the invader cell.
Professor Merkulov's associates set themselves the task of measuring the cell's life cycle by stages. This information is needed both for scientists and for medical practitioners. This will help combat many diseases, primarily malignant growths. Since in different periods of life the cell's sensitivity varies, scientists are trying to establish at what hours of the day and night, and at what intervals, patients should take medicine to inflict the most destructive blow at the disease. Professor Merkulov and his coworkers believe that this should be done several hours before the cell starts dividing. :
