In reply to the Comments by Lestrel on my earlier article (1966) in Eugenics Quarterly I have only two brief points.
1. Theconcept of adaptation is a very broad one for most biologists. I have no objection to the definition in mathematical terms as expressed by Fisher. It obviously serves a research purpose for genetics. By the same token I am sure that thedefinition of adaptation used by physiologists which is definitely not encompassed by Fisher's formulation, is a useful concept to them. I was simply attempting in the article to show that adaptation as used classically could provide newconcepts for human biology by spanning information from severalfields. This definition was ably stated by Dubois (1965) as follows:
For the general biologist, the best and perhaps theonly measure of adaptive fitness to a particular environment is theextent to which theorganismsof the species under consideration can occupy this environment, make effective use of its resources, and therefore multiply abundantly in it.
2. I regret that Lestrel saw fit to worry the old bone of Bergman's rule again.

There seems to have been a considerable misunderstanding about this rule. It is no more than a nonstatistical way of saying that within many animal species there is a significant positive correlation between the body weight of speciessubgroups and the annual temperature of their physical environment. It is not a causal statement. As concerns mansuch a correlation was ably demonstrated by Roberts (1953) and further supported by Newman's analyses (1960) of New World populations. As a simple statement of correlation it is not open to opinion unless reason can be shown whythe correlations calculated by these investigators are invalid.
