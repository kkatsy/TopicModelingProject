A PROGRAM IN POPULATION GENETICS AND DEMOGRAPHY

PHILIP M. HAUSER Population Research and Training Center
and Chicago Community Inventory University of Chicago Chicago, Illinois

An advanced postdoctoral training program in Population Genetics and Demography has been established at the University of Chicago, under a grant from the National Science Foundation. This program will provide fellowships for a small group of demographers and population geneticists interested in learning each other's disciplines and techniques. The program is under the auspices of the University Committee on Population and work will be directed by P. M. Häuser, N. Keyfitz, R. C. Lewontin, T. Park, and other members of the Committee.
An ad hoc University Committee on Population has been appointed at the University of Chicago with the view of establishing a curriculum that would

enable students in departments other than sociology to obtain training in population in winning the Ph.D degree in their own departments. The Committee, under the chairmanship of Philip M. Häuser of the Department of Sociology, includes Richard C. Lewontin, Zoology; Thomas Park, Zoology; Theodore Schultz, Economics; Dr. Frederick Zuspan, Obstetrics and Gynecology; Dr. Robert Page, Medicine; William H. Kruskal, Statistics; F. Clark Howell, Anthropology; Leo A. Goodman, Sociology; Nathan Keyfitz, Sociology; and Joseph R. Swartwout, Obstetrics and Gynecology. The Committee is also considering the development of appropriate research and training proposals.
