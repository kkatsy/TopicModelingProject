SOME OBSERVATIONS ON RECENT CHANGES IN AMERICAN FERTILITY BASED ON SAMPLE SURVEY DATA*

Period measures of fertility such as the crude birth rate or the total fertility rate have been declining rather conspicuously since 1957. By 1966 the crude birth rate in the United States had declined to 18.7 from a postwar peak of 25.3. The figure for the year corresponds precisely with the depression average for 1933-39. To this we may add that the birth rate is likely to decline even further in 1967 to the lowest level ever experienced in this country (the January and February rates are below 18). A variety of postwar period fertility measures are displayed in Table 1.
In sharp contrast, data from several national surveys taken since 1954-1955 generate a picture of increasing fertility when attention is focussed on cohort measures, for example, children ever born by age. The Current Population Surveys of 1954-1964 exhibit a marked rise since 1957 in number of live births to ever married women age 25-39, while the mean number of births to women 20-24 has remained stable (Table 2).
* Revised version of paper presented at the meetings of the Population Association, Chicago, 1965.

Smaller national fertility surveys of married women 18-39, available since 1955, provide similar results. In addition, the attempt via these surveys to obtain an advance look at final cumulative fertility by asking questions about expected number of children, suggests that the combinations of cohorts contributing to the samples of the 1960's will eventually have more children than comparably aged women in1955.
The two approaches to fertility measurement, period and cohort, along with differences in their time trends have resulted in some debate and confusion. Quite correctly, the lead lines of tworecent government publications are "Birth rate continues its decline," and "Continuing increase in the average number of children ever born in the 1960's." These patterns are consistent with one another. The purpose of this paper is to extract data from a series of surveys which will illuminate some aspects of the period-cohort phenomenon during this transitional phase in fertility patterns.
Five fairly small surveys (total N, 1700-2700 each) of almost identical sam-

pie design provide a substantial part of the data in this report. The 1955 and 1960 Surveys have been identified in the literature as Growth of American Families--"GAF" in the tables. The surveys of 1962, 1963, and 1964 are restricted in scope because they are essentially trailer studies--two minutes of fertility questions attached to national samples conducted for other purposes by the Survey Research Center. The two-minute component originates from the Population Studies Center at the University of Michigan. These studies are identified as "UMPSC" in the tables. All five studies include only currently married women 18-39. A limited amount of data are also available from the 1965 National Fertility Study, called "NFS" in the tables.
At any point in time, period fertility may exceed, equal, or fail to reach the fertility level of the cohorts contributing to the period. Among the relevant cohort variables that affect period fertility are the final cumulative births among ever married women, the spacing of these births within marriage, the proportion

marrying by the end of the childbearing years, and the distribution of age at first marriage.
The complete sequence in the timing of events in marriage leading to completed family has not been described until fairly recently, most of our attention having been centered on size of completed family. Reasons for lack of this description are: the Marriage Registration Area is far from complete, birth records do not contain data on the timing of previous events, and most fertility surveys have age and marriage restrictions resulting in forms of selectivity which do not provide adequate marriage or birth cohort data to obtain an historical sense of cohort trends. A significant part of this void in fertility history was filled by the Current Population Survey of marriage fertility, and childspacing of 1959. The C.P.S. data are employed here to provide long term trends and the five surveys are used in an attempt to supplement and update some of the C.P.S. material. These data are displayed in Table 3.

Median age at marriage appears to have been fairly stable among the marriage cohorts of 1901-1910 to 1925-1929. The depression andwarcohorts married at later ages. This was followed by a sharp decline in median age at marriage among the postwar cohorts. The intervals from marriage to first, second, and third birth follow almost identical patterns--stability in interval for cohorts unaffected by the depression andwar, followed by a rise associated with these events, andsharp decline since that time.
The estimation process for birth intervals is handled as follows: In the C.P.S. Study the proportion of ever married women who have already achieved a particular birth parity is cumulatively distributed by intervals since marriage. Determination of the median interval from marriage to parity X is dependent

on the final parity distribution of the marriage cohort. A first approximation of the final parity distribution for a given marriage cohort is provided by data on expected number of children from the five small surveys. The proportion of women who expect to achieve first parity, for example, is unrealistically high for recent marriage cohorts because they cannot anticipate potential fecundity impairments. The expectation data maybe adjusted downward forthe proportion who will eventually have a first birth and the median interval estimated from the data reported by C.P.S. Examples are shown in the first footnote toTable 3.
If we accept the survey data on expected number of children, indicating that there will be essentially no change in completed family size for women age

* Figures in parentheses dealing with birth intervals are estimates made by the author from the necessarily incomplete data provided by the Census Bureau report, "Marriage, fertility and childspacing: August, 1959." Median interval estimates were prepared by estimating the proportion of ever married women whowould eventually have a first, second, or third birth. For example, it was estimated that 94 percent o£ the 1955-59 marriage cohort would have a first birth, 83 percent of the 1950-54 marriage cohort would have a second birth, etc. Should these estimates prove to be high, the actual intervals will be shorter than the estimated intervals.
·f Estimates of expected number of children for marriage cohorts are shown in parentheses. These estimates were made from published and unpublished materials from the 1955 and 1960GAF and from 1962,1963, and 1964 UMPSC. The use of data from all five studies was required because of the selectivity with respect to marriage cohort produced by a sample design restricted to currently married and with an agecutoff at 39. The earliest (oldest) marriage cohorts are misrepresented in each of thestudies.

18-39 in the period 1955-1965, then the major shifts in period fertility measures in the past dozen years must be attributed to changes in age at marriage, proportions marrying, and the spacing of births. In the absence of any change in the total cumulative fertility of cohorts, changes in these components would have contributed to the overlapping of births from successive cohorts making up a given period. An oversimplified example will illustrate the point. Suppose women born in 1935 marry at age 20 and have their first birth two years later (1957). Suppose also that women born in 1936 marry at 19 or 20 and have their first birth one or two years later. Either the lowered marriage age or the compressed first birth interval will result in a double dose of first births in 1957. This bunching of births leads to inflated period measures of fertility. The 19551962 Total Fertility Rates of 3.5 to 3.8 are higher than the final number of children ever born to any single cohort passing through the period.
Imagine now that mean age of childbearing ceases to decline and becomes constant while completed family size remains constant. Under these circumstances the births are less compressed in any period and the distortion of the period rates is reduced. Going one more step--mean age of childbearing rises-- leads to a fanning out of births with distortion of the period rates in the opposite direction, that is, underestimating the cohort rates.
What has been happening with respect to marriage patterns recently? In Table 4, the data illustrate the relationship between marriage potential and marriage for the most recent periods. A ratio of the number of females age 18-21 to the number of males age 21-24 (including armed forces overseas) is shown for the years 1954-1967 together with

projections to the year 1985. The ratio is inversely related to marriage potential for females. The simple fact that women select older males for marriage can produce highly varying degrees of availability when the size of birth cohorts is altered from period to period. Between 1950 and 1954, the conditions of availability favored the women. Since 1956, the situation has been reversed, as women born in the latter part of the depression were marrying men born in the first part of the depression and as female war babies reached marriage age while their appropriate male counterparts came from the smaller depression cohorts. Today, there are about 16 percent more females than males in the selected age categories, or an excess of about one million. Obviously the demographic constraints placed on desired marriage patterns have become considerable in the 1960's.
The imbalance between the sexes will virtually disappear in the 1970's and will be reversed in the 1980's, reflecting changes in the numbers of births that have occurred in the past six or seven years. If there is some objection to the age range I have used to represent potential marriage partners, a series developed by Don Akers of the Census Bureau shows essentially the same results with a broader age group and a difference in age of about two-and-one-quarter years, which is about equal to the difference in median age at marriage for men and women (third deck of Table 4).
Some indication of the response to this marriage squeeze is shown in the lower decks of Table 4. The most likely resolution of this problem would be increasing marriage age for women, smaller proportions of women marrying, an increasing proportion of men marrying, a declining difference in marriage age for men and women, and possibly greater

incidence of remarriage among males. The Vital Statistics data from a group of 19 states and from Michigan do show what appears to be the end of a long term decline in median age at marriage for women. The response of Michigan women to the demographic constraints which built up rapidly during the late 1950's and 1960's seems most reasonable: an increasing age at marriage and a decline in the age gap between brides and grooms. Additional impressions of the path of period median age at marriage are derived from women married less than two years in the 1960 GAF and 1962-1964 UMPSG Studies. Women married up to 2.0 years have been used simply to build up the number of cases to a vaguely respectable figure. The increase shown for median age at marriage is matched by data not shown here on means for the series. One gains more confidence in the possibility of the period reversal in median age at marriage by reference to the Current Population Survey data on proportion ever married by age. There is a clear drop off from the highs of the late 1950's among young women, whereas the proportion of males 25-29 who have been married has increased sharply in the past few years.
As data become available in future years they should be evaluated in relation to the constraints on marriage potential. The current crop of marriage eligible females is simply faced with a difficult task. That fewer are marrying and they are marrying later doesn't necessarily mean that they are becoming more career oriented and less family oriented or a variety of other similar "explanations." Here then, is one fact which is contributing to the decline in period fertility.
Probably much more important for the changes in period fertility over the past dozen years have been shifts in the

spacing of children within marriage. We have already seen that birth intervals were greatly compressed during the postwar period so that the median first birth interval is estimated to be 1.2 years for 1955-1959 marriages (Campbell estimates 1.1 years). This is a shorter interval than the one experienced in marriages at the beginning of the century. The same statement may be made about second and third intervals as well.
Unpublished results from a study by Pratt involving the matching of marriage and birth records indicate that the first birth interval is actually shorter than the intervals reported in surveys. His data from Detroit indicate that about half of the first births to white women in the latter part of the 1950's and early 1960's occur in less than 12 months of marriage. Survey data from the same group of women contained errors in reported dates of marriage and childbirth among 14 percent of the cases. Half of these turned out to be cases of premarital conception.
Pratt's study of couples who had recently given birth and his larger study of 1960 marriages in the Detroit area is focused on the incidence of premarital conception, that is, conception, marriage, and birth in that order. He found about 20--25 percent of the varied samples to contain a premarital conception. It seems well within the range of possibility that the declining age at marriage and first birth interval were linked with an increasing incidence of premarital conception. Current Population Survey data show increasing numbers of first births in intervals of less than nine months among the postwar marriage cohorts through the 1955-1959 cohort. Comparable C.P.S. data are not available for the 1960's, although the number of children born to women married less

than oneyear had declined between 1960 and 1962.
Unfortunately, data on spacing patterns for other birth intervals in the current decade is even more limited. Table 5 supplements the Current Population Survey data on birth intervals with material from the 1957 Family Growth in Metropolitan America Study and the 1962 Detroit Area Study. The design of the latter study is comparable to the design of the former, in that white women were interviewed about one-half year after their second birth. As seen, the median interval between marriage and first birth and between first and second birth is down by about 0.3 years in the 1962study. According to the1960 Census the number of children ever born per white ever married woman 2529 was about 12 percent higher in the Detroit SMSA than the seven SMSA's which made up the FGIMA sample. In this case, we might expect a more compact spacing of births in the DASsample. However, these data suggest that a reversal of the declining spacing pattern may not have occurred between 1957 and 1962.
The 1962-1964 UMPSC Studies of married women do not contain data on birth dates of children. In other words,

the basic spacing data are not available for the first part of this decade. There are some indirect routes to spacing sensitive data by manipulating live births, duration of marriage, and expected number of children. These results are given in Tables 6 and7.
Without birth interval data, the children most couples now have represent ancient history in relation to the problem of what has happened to spacing in the past few years. Only couples of short marriage duration provide the appropriate information. Among couples married less than two years the proportion who have had a first birth is less in1962, 1963, and 1964 than was the case in 1960. Couples married for 2 to 3.9 years in 1962-1964 have had the same number of births as those is the comparable duration category in 1960, whereas couples married 4-5.9 years have a slightly higher parity distribution in 1962-1964 than in 1960. This would suggest that if a reversal in the timing of births has occurred, it took place in the 1960's, not before.
In a sample with fixed age limits (1839 in our case) a sort on duration of marriage forces differences in the limits of age at marriage for various duration groups. Women married zero years can

have married at ages 18-39, but women married five years must have married between the ages of 13 and 34. If successive marriage cohorts (including marriages at all ages) expect the same number of children, data from a sample of women 18-39 should result in increasing

expectations with duration of marriage to the extent that marriage age affects expectations. The 1960 data show smaller expectations with increasing duration, suggesting that succeeding waves of marriage cohorts around 1960 anticipated having more children. By

1962-1964 this pattern had disappeared, so that a flattening or slight reversal of expectations appears possible. These changes are minor (statistically insignificant) and the basic impression one gets is the absence of any pronounced change in recent marriage cohorts.
The data on spacing patterns provide more convicing evidence of change (Table 7). The proportion of expected births that have already occurred by a given duration is down for 0-1 duration couples, comparing 1962-1964 with 1960 while it is the same or may have increased slightly among couples of longer duration. If we can ignore sampling fluctuations, this dates the change in the relative timing of births in the 1960's. When births expected in the next five years are tacked on to those already born and the sum divided by total expected births we obtain the proportion of total expectations born by duration X plus 5 years--a picture of relative timing in the recent past and near future. In this case, each of the duration groups in each of the studies of 1962, 1963, and 1964 expects to have achieved a smaller share of their final product by duration X + 5. This reverses the trend in timing patterns beginning with the postwar marriage cohorts.
At this point it may appear that we have grossly over--interpreted small differences based on small numbers of cases. But a period distortion of cohort fertility is reduced when a cohort trend has come to an end and stabilized even without being reversed. There was certainly little room for additional compression. A median second birth interval of 2.1 years among second parity Detroit women or 1.7 years among fourth parity women, while not a biological minimum, is exceptionally short for a population in which nearly all couples practice some form of family limitation. In Tai-

chung, Taiwan, for example, the median second birth interval is 1.9 years.
Additional evidence is limited but suggestive. Studies of spacing done in Detroit in 1962 indicate that the birth intervals desired were somewhat longer than the birth intervals experienced. With the introduction of the pill in 1960, there should be much greater efficiency in the ability of couples to space their children according to the desired pattern. Changes in spacing have probably been the key factor in the decline of period fertility. If the youngest married women in 1955, 1960, and 1965 all expect to have about three children (we know this to be the case) then spacing must be a major element in the reduction of period fertility. This can be illustrated simply. Expectations have been fairly constant at three for the past ten years yet the proportion of women age 25-29 who have already had three births has increased from 35 percent in 1957 to 41 percent in 1964. Under these circumstances the number of children to be born in succeeding years is constantly declining, giving us the lower period rates.
Data from surveys conducted in the 1960's indicate that an efficient and desirable method of contraception could result in a substantial change in spacing patterns:
About 45 percent of married women report that they had some of their children earlier than they would have preferred.
Forty-four percent of all pregnancies to married women were conceived before contraception was begun.
Twenty-eight percent of all pregnancies to married women were conceived when the couple was not particularly interested in having children or the conception was specifically an accident.

After only five years on the market, the oral pill hadbeen used by 26 percent of the married women under 45. Its use among the younger couples is even more pronounced. Although there has been no significant change in the proportion of users between 1960 and 1965 the substitution of the oral pill for less efficient methods should produce marked changes in the figures reported immediately above.
As of now, there is no evidence to suggest that we are about to experience a decline in the number of childrenper married couple. The decline in period fertility appears to be a function of changes in marriage and spacing patterns. Women born in the first part of the 1930's are likely to have the largest families among the birth cohorts 19201945. With theexception of this group, the average number of children expected per couple included in the period covered by thesurveys varies within the rather narrow range of 3.0 to 3.2 children.
Many questions about the future path of fertility will be answered as the results of the 1965 National Fertility Survey are published. ACurrent Population Survey comparable to the 1959 survey of marriage, fertility, and child spacing would be exceptionally valuable as a means of firmly documenting this transitional phase rather than relying on the bits and pieces which necessarily make up this report.
