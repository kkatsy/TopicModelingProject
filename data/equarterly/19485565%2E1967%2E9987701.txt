FAMILY SIZE IN THE 1960's--A BAFFLING FAD? *

In 1958 the United States crude birth rate turned downward, starting a decline that was to be continuous through the early months of 1966. A loss of 24% in the rate between 1957 and 1966 (a decline from 25 to 19 births per 1000 population) left the American people with yearly birth rates comparable to those existing between 1930 and 1940.
The sharp decline in annual birth rates understandably has fired the interest of laymen as well as of demographers. For example, journalistic expression on the subject recently reached a peak with the appearance, during one week in May, 1966, of two major articles in weekly news magazines--the lead article in Time's May 6 issue (Time, 1966) and a feature article in the May 9 issue of U.S. News and World Report (1966). Earlier articles may be found in U.S. News and World Report (1964a, 1964b, 1964c, 1965), Business Week (1964, 1965), and The Wall Street Journal (1964a, 1964b). Unfortunately, however, since journalistic output is swifter than technical analysis, misrepresentations and misinterpretations of this demographic

change have received a scientifically unchallenged "press." In fact, the intellectual stream has even begun to flow backward from popular to pseudo-technical statements on the subject. Undocumented "trends" are now being "interpreted" by some social scientists (see, statements by Philip M. Hauser and Margaret Mead elsewhere in this paper) as well as journalists.
In particular, two important and interrelated inaccuracies are recurring with some frequency. One is that the decline in annual birth rates was unforeseen by and is baffling to fertility analysts, and the second is that this "baffling" turn of events is clear proof of a new vogue for smaller families. Popular accounts are peppered with direct and indirect quotations from nameless "experts" who allegedly are mystified by the declining birth rate. For example, "But for now, population projecting is more than usually hazardous, because of the baffling behavior of the birth statistics, the major determinants of future growth. 'The gyration in the birth rate is the thing that's puzzling everyone/ says one population expert. 'We'd sure like to know what's going on' " (The Wall Street Journal, 1946b). It is also frequently implied that a "population explosion" was "predicted" and that a slight revision downward in Census estimates of total population in the next few decades constitutes something of a major fiasco for the "seers." U.S. News and World Report (1966) says, "Instead of an expected 'population explosion/ the birth rate has been declin-

ing sharply in recent years. . . . American women seem to be making a shambles of the theory of a never-ending 'population explosion' for the U. S." The conviction that "small" rather than "large" families are now in vogue (in counterdistinction to the post-war period which is often depicted as an era of "five or six children") is widely expressed (U.S. News and World Report, 1964c, 1965, 1966; Time, 1966; and Newsweek, 1964).
The first part of this paper will briefly dispute the allegation that demographers as a whole did not anticipate and do not understand the present drop in the birth rate. Then, in the main body of the paper, the notion that family size has become "the subject of fad and fashion" (in the words of Philip M. Hauser) will be evaluated by an analysis of data on ideal family size from the 1963 and 1966 Gallup polls.
THE ANTICIPATED DECLINE IN ANNUAL
BIRTH RATES
The notion that population analysts did not expect and are now "baffled" by recent changes in the crude birth rate seems to be based on two widespread misconceptions concerning the relevance of annual birth rates as indicators of demographic change. One is that trends in crude birth rates (birth rates that do not take changing age structure into account) are genuinely expressive of shifts in yearly birth performance. The second is that yearly birth rates generally (even age-specific birth rates) can be taken as indicators of trends in completed family size. Faith in one or the other of these misconceptions (or both) leads to the idea that a sharp variation in annual birth rates requires some fulldress "explanation" in terms of social, economic, or biological trends. When

such an "explanation" is not forthcoming, so-called population experts are said to be "baffled."
Actually the crude birth rate is not, of course, necessarily indicative ieither of underlying annual reproductive performance or of completed family size. With regard to annual performance, a changing proportion of women in the prime reproductive ages can affect crude birth rates quite markedly, even when age-specific birth rates remain constant. In the case of recent declines in the United States birth rate, the changing age structure was a factor. Age-specific birth rates declined somewhat at just the time when the population of young women in the principal reproductive ages was at a low point. Whereas in 1950 the female population aged 20-29 was approximately 12 million in the United States, by 1960 this jiumber had dropped to 11 million (Bogue, 1963, pp. 75-76). Census estimates show that it did not reach the 12 million mark again until 1964. Even in 1966 estimates place it at less than 13 million. Thus, although it is true that beginning with 1964, the number of women in the reproductive ages was on the rise again, most of the period of fertility decline so far has been abetted by an unfavorable age distribution. For example, Whelpton (1963) has shown that if the proportion of women in the principal reproductive ages had remained at the 1955 level, the crude birth rate would have continued virtually unchanged during the period 1956-1961 with a slight decline beginning in 1962. Had a decline in age-specific rates such as we have been experiencing occurred when the proportion of reproducing women was at a high point, the downward trend in the crude birth rate would have been so slight as probably to go unnoticed by everyone except demographers.

But even when the confounding effects of changing age structure are eliminated through the use of age-adjusted or agespecific birth rates, these rates are still measures of annual birth performance. The latter is not equivalent to completed family size, nor is variation in such annual performance necessarily due to family-size changes. Although a sustained change in family size will be reflected at some point in annual birth rates (other things equal), the latter may vary for reasons that are not dependent upon a change in the number of children women will ultimately bear. This is because such annual birth figures result from the pace of family formation and completion and not just from the level of family size. The frequency with which families are started and the rate at which family-building takes place have complex components-- proportions marrying and age at marriage, birth intervals, and the fertility histories of currently reproducing women. Even short-run fluctuations in these components can cumulate and produce striking changes in the annual birth rate, since millions of women are involved in such relatively minor shifts. Yet, because the completed family size of a cohort of women is determined by their behavior throughout their repro-

ductive lives (and not just in particular years), completed fertility may remain relatively constant from one cohort to the next despite fluctuations in annual performance. Annual rates and family size may even move in opposite directions. At present, for example, completed family size is rising at the same time that crude birth rates are falling. Cumulative fertility rates for cohorts of American women for the years 1959-- 1965 (Table 1) show a rise in family size at eachfive-yearlevel (ages 25-49). Moreover, throughout the period women aged 30-34 had already borne as many children as those aged 40-44. Some declines in cumulative fertility rates may be found among the two youngest cohorts of women, indicating a postponement of marriage and/or of childbearing after marriage.
Demographers discovered the importance for current birth rates of "timing and pacing" factors when these analysts were investigating the long-range significance of the so-called "baby boom" that has just ended in the United States. It was the systematic recognition of these factors that enabled them to anticipate the recent decline in the birth rate. They used information on annual births by age of mother and birth order for groups of women themselves born in

the same years (birth cohorts of mothers), data on "number of children ever "born" collected by decennial censuses, and family-size goals and intentions as discovered by special fertility surveys (Freedman et al., 1959; Hajnal, 1947; Ryder, 1956, 1960; Whelpton, 1954; Whelpton and Campbell, 1960; Whelpton et al., 1966). These materials showed that the maintenance of post-war rates through the latter part of the 1950 to 1960 decade was not due to an underlying family-size marathon. Women were not having and were not intending to have families as large as the annual birth performance of those years (if continued indefinitely) implied. Rather, early in the post-war period older women "made up" births that they had postponed during the depression and war years, and, at the same time, young women started to "anticipate" their reproductive, futures by marrying younger and starting and completing their families sooner. Long after the effect of "made up" births was dissipated, the effect on annual birth rates in the 1950's of "anticipated" or "borrowed" births was in full sway. In fact, as Whelpton (1946) demonstrated, American women could not have continued the birth performance of the "baby boom" years for any length of time since, in a number of those years, first-order and second-order birth rates implied that a generation of women reproducing at these rates would have had impossible numbers of births. For example, Whelpton discovered that a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 women reproducing throughout the fertile period at the age-specific firstbirth rates of 1942 would have had 1,084 first births. Similar calculations for 1946, 1947, and 1948 showed that, respectively, 1,136, 1,380, and 1,179 first births would have occurred to 1,000 women at the end of their reproductive period (Whelp-

ton, 1954, pp. 1-15). This result is clearly impossible even if all women married, none were sterile, and none practiced contraception.
The postwar acceleration of family formation and completion was documented by demographers and its anticipated effects on yearly births during the 1960's were outlined. It was clear that unless these young mothers (who had "borrowed" into the 1950's births that would have occurred in the 1960's at a slower pace of marrying and reproducing) also intended to have considerably larger families than their immediate predecessors, annual births were due to fall. Since women showed no evidence in surveys of a widespread preference for families above three and four children, this possible source of a continued boom in births was lacking. To be sure, further declines in age at marriage and further shortening of the periods between births among prospective mothers (an additional round of "borrowing") were possible, but these were judged by demographers to be most unlikely for a variety of reasons.1 When this timing and pacing lull was combined with a temporarily unfavorable age structure, the stage was set for a marked decline in the birth rate. An excellent statement (published in 1958 but written no later than 1957) by Norman B. Ryder (1958) of the anticipated decline and
1A further decline in feminine age at marriage would imply a change in educational trends since the present youthful age is close to the time of high-school graduation. Moreover, unless the age-gap between husband and wife continues to shorten, "baby-boom" females must seek husbands among numerically smaller cohorts because these older males reflect the birth performance of less "booming" years. , As for birth intervals, the increased use of highly effective contraceptive methods will enable Americans to realize their spacing desires more readily. For a discussion of the relative care exercised by couples for spacing as against prevention, see Westoff et al. (1963, pp. 38-44) and Whelpton et al. (1966, pp. 292-298).

a delination of the reasons for this
projected drop follows:
Enough time has now passed, however, to make postponement irrelevant for the analysis of present fertility. The maintenance--and even continued rise--of fertility has tempted some into the invalid position that the conventional total fertility rate can now be regarded as a fair representation of underlying cohort behavior. The indefensibility of such a view can be shown again by breaking down the total fertility rates of the 1950's into the contributions made by births of different orders. The average numbers of first and second births are still far higher than a real group of women could possibly achieve. Since postponement is no longer involved, this suggests that another source of distortion is in the picture. There has been a progressive shift of the child-bearing of successive cohorts away from the older and toward the younger ages. This development is inflating annual measures of fertility well above what they otherwise would be, to the order of 15 to 20 percent. . . . Our findings may be used as a basis for looking a few years into the future of United States fertility. In the first place, unless some development occurs which has not yet manifested itself in the data, the rise in cohort fertility is likely to cease soon because the sources of recent increase--the proportions of women in the lowest parities--have almost been exhausted. Secondly, current fertility--and thus the annual numbers of births as well--is unlikely to be buoyed up much longer by the changing age of reproduction. When the decline in the average age at which women bear their children is checked, as it eventually must be, then the conventional total fertility rate will lose its component of spurious upward distortion and consequently decline, provided cohort fertility remains constant. Finally, the proportion of the population within the fertile-age span will continue to diminish and thus tend to depress the birth rate until the large postwar cohorts reach the

reproductive ages and thus reverse the age distribution within the fecund-age span. It is the writer's impression that, providing the politico-economic environment remains essentially stable, the conjuncture of these factors will produce a marked decline in the birth rate--perhaps by as much as 20 percent--within the next decade. Should economic conditions deteriorate, a much more pessimistic forecast is in order because childbearing is now so largely voluntary.
Publishing in 1959, Freedman and asso-
ciates (1959, pp. 382-384) pinpointed
exactly the recent career of the crude
birth rate in the 1960's. They said:
In 1955, when the data presented in this book were collected, the United States was riding the crest of a wave of births that started rising in the late 1930's with the recovery from the depression . . . the upward movement of this wave was caused not so much by changes in average family size as by a lowering of age at marriage and childbearing, and the making up of births postponed during World War II and the depression that preceded it. When all the postponed births are made up, and the tendency to marry and have the first birth at progressively younger ages stops, agespecificbirth rates will decline and the crest of the wave will have passed. This may occur even though the average size of completed families becomes substantially larger than it is now.
The expectation that the present wave of population growth will eventually subside is brought out by . . . projected [crude birth] rates from 1955-1960 to the end of the century. . . .
According to our medium forecast this rate will decline slightly from 1950-54 to 1955-60 and then drop substantially to an average of 19 or 20 in the 1960's. This decline is not due to any decrease in average family size; on the contrary, this factor is assumed to increase slightly. It is due solely to our assumptions about the

Vol. 14, No. 1

timing of marriages and births. The medium assumptions are that the proportions marrying and starting their families at the younger ages will decline somewhat and then stabilize. . . . Only if fertility is like the high assumptions, which extend recent trends in timing patterns and allow family size to increase, can the crude birth rate remain relatively stable in the next 10 years at 24 or 25--approximately the 1950-55 level. [Italics mine.]
Regarding recent declines in the birth
rate, therefore, we may say that they do
not require an interpretation in terms
of some major change in family-size
levels, nor do data on actual or ideal
family size during the period (to be
presented in the next section) suggest
such an interpretation. These declines
are explicable largely in terms of age
structure and timing and spacing fluctua-
tions. Of course, when a final analysis
is possible, there will doubtless be some
variation that is left unexplained by
these factors. This will probably be
partialled among a number of addi-
tional variables, one of which may well
be some decline in unwanted births of
high parities.
But what of the future? Here, of
course, the same type of analysis comes
into play. As for age structure, we
already know that the late 1960's will
bring the "baby boom" babies up to
the age level of reproduction. In other
words, a "bumper crop" of potential
mothers is close upon us. This factor,
in and of itself, should raise the crude
birth rate over current levels (Bogue,
1963, pp. 76-77). On the other hand,
immediate assessment of the exact re-
sults of any possible changes in "tim-
ing and spacing" is more difficult be-
cause this complex involves many
variables about which we do not always

have current, extensive, and accurate data. It can be said, however, that the most crucial question is whether a new "change of pace" is beginning--a shift upwards in the age at marriage and a lengthening of birth intervals. Such a slackening of the speed of marrying and reproducing could help to prolong the "baby slump" we are now experiencing just as the previously mentioned acceleration of this pace prolonged the "baby boom" through most of the 1950's. Fortunately, efforts are now being made to gather current data on child-spacing and child-spacing preferences and intentions. If, eventually, we can acquire a systematic series of data on marriage intentions and age-at-marriage preferences over time, we will have a far more accurate way of taking the nation's reproductive pulse.
Finally, we must emphasize that if a marked change in family-size goals did occur (and if it were realized in practice), it would in time substantially affect annual rates, as births of the desired order were born or those of an undesired order were curtailed. Therefore, the notion that we are now in the midst of a new "fad" for families of two, as against three and four, children bears close examination because of its potential (if not its current) effect on annual birth rates. Such a revolutionary change--and the change would be revolutionary when measured against what we know of trends in family-size preferences--could have a drastically downward effect on the reproductive performance of American women.
Is THERE EVIDENCE FOR A NEW SMALL-
FAMILY FAD?
The "fad and fashion" interpretation of recent declines in the birth rate is

Blake

best represented by a quotation from Philip M. Hauser (Time, 1966) who says:
The number of children one has has become the subject of fad and fashion. This is the same kind of pattern that enters into other kinds of consumer habits. The third and fourth child were a form of status during the post-World War II baby boom. Now fashion is swinging women to the view that it is desirable to have fewer children.
Margaret Mead is also cited by the same
source (Time, 1966) as alleging that it
is no longer fashionable for the educated
to have large families. Miss Mead's en-
thusiasm for declining birth rates and
her somewhat idiosyncratic view of pop-
ulation dynamics are both illustrated
by a direct quotation from her in the
same article:
Any and every drop in the birth rate is desirable. We've got enough people in the world and in this country so that there is no danger we'll ever run out. We have lots of people, but what we need is high-caliber individuals contributing as individuals. We need quality; quantity takes care of itself.
Claims that a new vogue for small
families is upon us are clearly not with-
out backers in the social sciences. The
crucial issue, however, is whether these
claims have social science backing. At
least two questions may be raised. The
first is whether existing knowledge con-
cerning the social and economic deter-
minants of family size would lead us
to expect that family-size desires are
likely to be matters of short-range fad
like many other kinds of "consumer
habits." We shall not discuss this prob-
lem in detail in the present paper since
it has been discussed in a previous paper
by the present author (Blake, 1965), and
is also undergoing detailed analysis in
another paper on economic variables in
relation to ideal family size.

Here we may suggest that family-size preferences are not primarily either "matters of taste" or objects of fashion, but rather socioeconomically structured goals that one would not expect to undergo drastic short-run fluctuation. It is true that children in the modern world are what economists call "items of consumption" and, therefore, that the status-symbolic role of consumption patterns is (theoretically, at least) relevant to family-size preferences (Barber and Lobel, 1952; Becker, 1960, pp. 209231; Fallers, 1954). However, in a society still placing heavy investments in differential sex roles and in marriage (both of which are, in turn, closely articulated with reproduction), the utilities gained by having children are not solely of the prestige type. Hence, the sociology of fashion, relying as it does so heavily on notions of conspicuous consumption and consumption battles, cannot be simply "applied" in toto to the interpretation of family-size levels. This is particularly true since, for each individual couple, children are "items of production" as well as "items of consumption." Consequently, both economic and noneconomic factors entering into the production of children are considerations for couples in determining desired family size. For example, the widespread rejection of the "only child" type of family in the United States is apparently based in some measure on a belief in the undesirability of the one-child family as a child-rearing unit. This belief helps to set a floor of at least two children on the level of family-size ideals.
Nor is the theory of family-size levels in an abstract limbo--undocumented and unsupported by empirical evidence. The fact is that in the United States, for example, neither family-size ideals nor family size itself fluctuated abruptly from year to year over the quarter of a

century prior to 1960. Mean family-size ideals from 13 national polls and surveys dating from 1936to 1961analyzed by Blake (1966a) are reproduced in Tables 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, and 12 of the present paper. The reader will see that lack of sharp variation over time is one of the most striking characteristics of these ideals. This isespecially true when the age structure of the various studies is made comparable. Asfor actual family size, neither census data oncompleted fertility nor cumulative birth rates for birth cohorts of women suggest abrupt temporal changes in American family size (Grabill, Kiser, andWhelpton, 1958, pp. 45-50; Whelpton and Campbell, 1960, pp. 49-50; Vital Statistics of the United States, 1964, p. 1-17). Gradual changes have occurred over this period, not faddish ones. Moreover, the distribution of both theideals and theactualities among sectors of the population does not have the epidemic-like characteristics of a "fad." Rather, there is remarkable consensus within the two-tofour child range (in both ideals and performance) anddifferences within this range (and above it aswell) are patterned along recognized socioeconomic lines such as farm residence, religion, and educational level (Blake, 1966a, 1966b; Freedman et al., 1959,pp. 100-212, 272318; Goldberg, 1959; Grabill et al., 1958; Westoff et al., 1961, pp. 178-281; Westoff et al., 1963,pp. 79-156; Whelpton et al., 1966, pp. 69-124).
Perhaps, however, there has been a sudden change. Perhaps family sizehas become a matter of fad and fashion with a sharp swing in theearly and mid1960's to smaller family goals--families of two, instead of three and four, children--as Hauser claims. Fortunately, we do not have to. rely on speculation for an answer. We canutilize data from Gallup polls conducted in 1963and 1966

in which a question on ideal family size was asked. Like other Gallup polls in which a question on ideal family size was included, these two asked the following question: "What do you consider is the ideal size of a family-- husband, wife, andhow many children?" The differences between questions on family-size "ideals" and family-size "expectations" are discussed in detail in Blake (1966a). The data on family-size ideals for 1963 and 1966 are continuous and comparable with those presented by Blake (1966a) for earlier years.

except the Gallup Youth Study of 1961 asked

the following question: "What do you consider

is the ideal size of a family--a husband, wife,

and how many children?" The Gallup Youth

questionnaire (1961) asked: "How many chil-

dren would you like to have?" The Roper Poll

of 1943 asked: "How many children would you

like to have if you had your choice?" and that

of 1948: "How many children do you think

makes the nicest size family?" The Growth of

American Families Studies of 1955 and 1960 in-

quired concerning "the ideal number of children

for the average American family." The mini-

mum distribution arises from coding range an-

swers (e.g., "two or three") to the lowest figure,

and the maximum results from coding them to

the highest figure. For men, the 1955 and 1960

data are responses by wives about the number

portion of respondents giving either three or four children as the ideal number. Table 4 shows that in the past 10 years 70 to 74% of white women are encompassed by the three- to four-child ideal. Significantly, the lower proportions saying three or four children in 1961 and 1963 are due not to an increased preference for two children in these studies, but to higher-than-usual proportions favoring families of more than four. We may conclude, therefore,

that no massive switch to the two-child goal among women is evident from these polls. Their most telling characteristic is the stability of means and proportions placing family-size ideals at the threeand four-child levels. Among men there is clearly no decline in recent years either.

Ideal Family Size by Age
A breakdown by age as well as sex (Table 5) shows a slight decline in mean ideal family size among all age groups in 1966 as against 1963. In particular, older men (who comprise roughly half of all men) evince a definite decline in ideals. However, Table 6, giving the means by age and sex for the entire 30-year period indicates that the changes between 1963 and 1966 are well within the range of variation during recent years. Although such slight declines may presage a new trend, they do not at present provide

evidence of great change. Of most interest is the fact that in both of these polls young women (those under age 30) give "two" children as their ideal more frequently than they have in any surveys since the early 1950's. However, when the same distribution is calculated for younger women (those aged 25 and under) the results are equivocal. In 1963, these younger women actually have a fractionally larger mean family-size ideal than that of the entire "under 30" group (3.5 as against 3.4) and only 14% instead of 22% are in the two-child category. In 1966, the results are the same for those "25 and under" as for those "under 30." Bearing in mind that only 44 and 54 women respectively are involved in this youngest age grouping for 1963 and 1966, the variability in the results is understandable.
Ideal Family Size by Religious Affiliation
Let us turn now to the recent results broken down by religious affiliation.

Table 7 gives the distributions and means for Catholics and non-Catholics by sex as found in the 1963 and 1966 polls. These data are continuous with those presented in a previous paper on Catholic and non-Catholic family size as shown in polls and surveys between 1943 and 1960 (Blake, 1966b). Table 8 compares the means by religious affiliation for these latest samples with those from the earlier surveys and polls. Noteworthy here is the lack of variation in familysize preferences over time among nonCatholic women--that is, the majority of American women. Non-Catholic men also do not evince any tendency to change their ideals markedly. Catholic ideals, among both men and women, show some tendency to decline in 1966 compared with recent high levels. A variation from year to year among Catholics such as is found in this series probably should not be interpreted seriously without more detailed knowledge of and control over the religious commitment of those who call themselves Catholics in

*Dots appear in this table in those cases where the relevant age or sex group was not sampled. In a few cases the age range of respondents differs slightly from the categories used. In the 1955 and 1960 surveys, the 30-44 year old category is made up of respondents who are aged 30-39. Moreover, in these two studies the ages given for men are those of their wives. The "under 30" category comprises respondents who are aged 17-24 in 1936, 18-25 in 1948, and 14-23 in 1961. In all other cases, this category is made up of respondents who range between 18 and 29. The "30-44" year category is comprised of women aged 25-44 in 1936 and those aged 40-44 in 1943. In 1948, the "45 and over" age group only includes those aged 40-55.

these surveys. It is worth noting that in 1966, the religious difference is less than half a child for both men and women. This finding suggests that no consistent widening of the religious differential is taking place.
Religious Affiliation and Age. Tables 9 and 10 present the distributions and means by religious affiliation and age for the 1963 and 1966 polls, and Tables 11 and 12 compare the means over the en-

tire time period for which we have data. From the latter we see that non-Catholic women aged 30-44 and 45 and over have shown no recent tendency to lower their ideals. Those under 30, on the other hand, show a decline in 1966 to a level comparable with the early 1950's. NonCatholic men have lowered their ideals very slightly on the average in all age groups between 1963 and 1966 but in the light of previous variation, the change between these two years is not noteworthy.
In contrast to non-Catholic women. Catholic women of all ages show a definite decline in family-size ideals with the 1966 poll. These latest results bring Catholic women back to the levels of the middle and late 1950's. The fact that this trend for Catholic women appears in all age groups leads one to think that it may not be entirely due to sampling biases in some polls favoring more devout Catholics. This is particularly true since it is found in Gallup polls, on the one hand, and the 1960 GAF study on the other.
CONCLUSION
Comparison of two recent Gallup polls (1963 and 1966) with 13 previous surveys dating back to 1936 shows no noteworthy shift in family-size ideals among white Americans. For the period 1953 through 1966, mean ideal family size among women varies only between 3.4 and 3.6 children.
There is evidence that women under 30, both Catholic and non-Catholic, are now manifesting somewhat lower ideals than they did at any time since the early 1950's. The most noticeable drop is among Catholics of both sexes; their recent goals have declined in comparison with their relatively high ideals during

their ideals more than a fractional amount. If family size has become "the subject of fad and fashion" in the United States, evidence for this thesis must come from sources other than the actual fertility or the reproductive ideals of Americans themselves.
This result does not, of course, imply that youthful family-size goals may not continue to decline over time. At present, however, such a shift downward is clearly not a potent force. To become one, it will have to pick up rapid momentum. Meanwhile, each year brings us closer to peak cohorts of young women. Given the present ideals and the known size of these youthful cohorts, the principal question is not whether crude birth rates will rise in the next few years, but how much, how soon, and for how long. This problem is far from "baffling." It simply requires the application of modern demographic techniques to continuous and up-to-date information on the components of family formation and completion.
