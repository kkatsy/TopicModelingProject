INTRODUCTION
Since Fox (1932) suggested that tastability for PTC (Phenylthiocarbamide) differs with each individual, a number of authors have introduced their results of the work on taste sensitivity for PTC in connection with the genetic concepts (Blakeslee, 1932; Das, 1956; Freire-Maia, 1960; Matsunaga and Tsuji, 1957; Matsunaga et al., 1954; Merton, 1958; Pons, 1960; etc.). The results they obtained are summarized as follows: first, the nontasters are affected by a simple autosomal recessive gene; second, the frequency of nontasters varies considerably among races and ethnic groups; and last, the individual difference of the PTC sensitivity seems to be closely related to susceptibility to certain kinds of diseases, such as diabetes (Terry, 1950), endemic goiter (Brand, 1963), and poliomyelitis (Brand, 1964).
Those findings have contributed not only to genetics but also to ethnologic fields for the development of studies on racial evolution. Up to now, in Korea, a peninsula located between China and Japan but in which hereditary characters of its population are still veiled, no one has attempted to measure the taste threshold for PTC. Two of the present authors have investigated the genetic situation of the Korean population since 1956, and the present paper is one result of such serial research.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
For the present study, the authors adopted fundamentally the same methods developed by Harris and Kalmus (1949). Four hundred and three males aged 18 to 35 and 368 females aged 13 to 41 were examined for their taste sensitivity to PTC.1 Almost all the subjects were college students in the Seoul area.
For the examination, a serial-dilution technique was used for evaluating the taste threshold of each subject. The test was started with the most diluted solution, No. 14 (containing 0.16 mg. of PTC per liter of water) and proceeded by twofold increase of concentration.
The examination was carried out in two steps. In the first step, the subject tasted a few drops of every solution starting with the most diluted (No. 14) and proceeded up to the solution that he was first able to taste as bitter. After each person's approximate threshold was determined, he proceeded to the second step of the examination. He was tested for his ability to distinguish four glasses containing PTC solution from four glasses of water containing no PTC by his tasting a few drops of liquid from each glass. All these PTC solutions were of the same dilution as the one in the first step which first tasted bitter to him. When he was able to point out four cups of solution without any difficulty, he was

examined with the next weaker solution in the same manner as above. The serial examinations for the taste threshold with gradually weaker solutions were continued until he was barely able to classify two groups, of solutions. On the other hand, if the subject was unable to identify four glasses of the PTC solution from eight glasses of which four glasses were water, he was given more concentrated PTC solutions to taste step by step until he was able to distinguish two groups of liquids. In this manner, each person's threshold was determined accurately.
A subject who was not able to taste even the stock PTC solution (No. 1) was classified in Group 1.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Distribution of the PTC Taste Thresholds
Table 1 shows the number of subjects and rates of threshold for PTC taste sense. The distribution of taste sensitivity in both sexes reveals bimodal distribution with the antimode at Number 5. All individuals who failed to experience a bitter taste of the solution up to Number 5 were denned as nontasters. In the present studies, females showed higher taste sensitivity to the PTC than males did. In other words, the mode of threshold of women was at Number 10, while that of men was at Number 9. The mean thresholds showed 9.56 in females and 8.69 in males (Table 2). The frequency of nontasters in females was still higher than in males (Table 3). The phenomenon that females have a higher sensitivity to PTC and a higher frequency of nontasters than males seems to be common in the populations in the world. That is, a number of workers in many parts of the world, such as Matsunaga et al. (1954), Pons (1955, 1960),

and Sheba et al. (1962), have reported that the high sensitivity occurs in females; and Matsunaga and Tsuji (1957) and Sheba et al. (1962) found that the female nontasters still maintain numerical superiority to male nontasters.
Table 4 compares the frequencies of nontasters in various populations. In this table three patterns are clearly evident. That is, the Caucasian population has the highest rate of nontasters (25% to 32%); the Negroid, the lowest (3%); with the Mongoloid intermediate between the other two races (10% to 15%). The frequencies of genes associated with PTC tastability in the Korean population are calculated by the method of Hardy-We'inberg's equation. Gene T (for tasters) is 0.612, and gene t (for nontasters) is 0.388.
Many studies on hereditary characters in the Korean population conducted by two of the present authors show the strikingly unique trend that some characters such as twinning (Kang and Cho, 1960; Kang et al., 1962) and color blindness (Kang et al., 1966) occur in their frequencies intermediate between Cauca-

sian and Mongoloid populations. These phenomena should be investigated in the future so that the anthropological situation of the Korean people among other races might be explained.
Smoking Effects on PTC Sensitivity
For this examination, only males were considered because in Korea female smokers are not very common. A man who smokes five or more cigarettes a day was defined as a moderate smoker (Pons, 1955). Table 5 compares the taste threshold to PTC and frequencies of nontasters in smokers and nonsmokers.
Apparently, in the Korean population the mean taste threshold of smokers (8.50) was slightly lower than that of nonsmokers (8.70); the frequency of nontasters in smokers (10.95%) was also lower than that in nonsmokers (15.04%). But both thresholds and the frequencies of nontasters between smokers and nonsmokers were not significantly different. Other researchers who investigated the taste sensitivity to PTC of nonsmokers and smokers (10 or more cigarettes daily) also calculated the frequencies of nontasters in the smokers' and nonsmokers, showing insignificant difference, even though smokers showed slightly low sensitivity (Cunha and Abreu, 1956; Falconer, 1947; Freire-Maia, 1960; Pons, 1955).
Taste Sensitivity and Food Favoritism
This experiment was carried out in order to examine the relationship between sensitivity to PTC and partiality to certain foods such as sugar and liquor. It was projected with the assumption that the liking or disliking of particular foods would be basically steady for each person by hereditary characters, even though almost all people's partiality to these foods would vary slightly with the

circumstances and would change occasionally in their lives.
For accuracy, the subjects were classified into three groups: like, moderate, and dislike for the particular foods, based upon the records shown by each subject at the examination. In this paper the data of the moderate group was omitted. The results are summarized in Table 6.
As Table 6 shows, even though their differences did not reach the significant level, one group that does not like sweet foods revealed a slightly higher threshold than the group that likes sugar, and the frequency of nontasters in the former was higher than in the latter.
The relationship between sensitivity to PTC and attitude to alcohol also has been investigated, although the majority of the subjects were not available for this study because they did not have a preference for strong liquor. The result of this study showed that one who likes to drink

alcohol had lower a threshold than did one who dislikes alcohol, and the thresholds between the two groups revealed significant difference. This fact means that one who likes liquor showed lower sensitivity to PTC. The percentage of nontasters in the proalcohol group was only 11.84, while that of the other group was 15.14. The difference between frequencies of nontasters of both groups, however, was not significant statistically.
SUMMARY
As one of the serial researches on the hereditary character of the Korean population, the authors obtained some results of the study on the sensitivity to Phenylthiocarbamide solution from students in the Seoul area. Four hundred eight of the males and 368 of the females were examined for their sense of taste. Their thresholds were measured by the sorting
