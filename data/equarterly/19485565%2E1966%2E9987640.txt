A Norwegian Scientific Expedition spent approximately four months conducting an ecological survey of Tristan da Cunha in 1938. As part of the study the complete genealogies of the Tristanites were determined and subsequently made available to one of the authors (STD) in connection with dental studies (Thomsen, 1952, 1955). Recent advances in the interrelated disciplines of genetics, anthropology, and medicine have given great impetus to population studies and especially to health problems pertaining to consanguineous matings. The purpose of this paper is to determine the coefficient of inbreeding, F, as defined by Wright (1922), on the people living on Tristan da Cunha in 1938 in the light of the physical and cultural conditions peculiar to this population.
Tristan da Cunha is the largest and only inhabitable island of a group of three that lie in the South Atlantic (37°05'S; 12°17'W) about 1750 miles from Cape Town and some 2650 miles from Buenos Aires. No habitable land exists between Tristan da Cunha and the continents of South America and Africa.
Tristan da Cunha is almost circular in outline, with an average diameter of 8 miles and a total area of 40 square miles. The island rises 2000 feet out of the sea and has a central volcanic peak

of 6760 feet. Nearly vertical cliffs fall directly to narrow, rocky shores. The coastline has few inlets or bays that can shelter fishing boats or passing ships.
The extreme physical isolation of the island from other populations, especially since the decline of the whaling industry and the lack of a sheltered harbor, had severely restricted gene flow with nonTristanites before 1938.
The first permanent settlement of Tristan da Cunha by forebears of the present population took place in 1816, when William Glass, a native of Scotland, and his wife, a Dutch-Negro halfcaste, settled on the island. Only 13 other immigrants contributed to the Tristanite gene pool between 1816 and 1938. These included two pairs of sisters, one of whom was accompanied by her daughter, fathered by a non-Tristanite.
According to Munch (1945), the population of Tristan da Cunha in 1938 consisted of 102 males and 86 females, whose distribution by age, sex, and marital status is shown in Table 1. It should be emphasized that in 1938 only 12 unmarried females were in the age group 15 to 29. Moreover, due mainly to the economic difficulties encountered in establishing a new household, the average girl did not marry till age 24. Thus the male's choice of marriage partner was limited.
The islanders' attitude toward firstcousin marriage was ambiguous. On the one hand, because of the teachings of Anglican missionaries from England,

the strong Roman Catholic background of some individuals, and the European orientation of most of the founders, marriage between close relatives was frowned upon outwardly. In reality, however, first-cousin marriages were common, with no strong objections voiced by the community.
Factors affecting the validity of the genealogies must also be considered. In almost all cases of pregnancy out of wedlock, the individuals involved married before the birth of the child. In the history of the island, only four illegitimate children were known to have been born. Unfortunately, in these cases the fathers of the children remained unknown; consequently, separate coefficients of inbreeding were calculated with these four individuals and their descendants included and excluded. The sexual habits of married people were largely unknown, but fidelity in marriage is assumed for present purposes--a reasonable assumption in view of their strong moral and religious codes and the social and physical setting on Tristan da Cunha.
Recently, Mange (1964) has developed a method of calculating Wright's coefficient of inbreeding, F, by means of a Fortran II program written for an IBM 1620 computer. In simple terms, F expresses the probability that two allelic genes at a given locus have a common origin. Mange's method is applicable to any bisexually reproducing species but

is limited to genealogies of not more than six generations. The information required includes for each individual: (1) sex, (2) parents, (3) approximate date of birth, and (4) children. This method has been applied successfully by Mange (1964) to the Hutterites and by Bonn6 to the Samaritans. If the required data are available, the technique provides a rapid and accurate measure of several aspects of inbreeding.
The mean coefficient of inbreeding for the entire living population of Tristan da Cunha in 1938 was 0.03483; 0.03652, excluding the four illegitimate children and their descendants. For inbred individuals the mean coefficient of consanguinity was 0.04835 with a range of 0.00781 to 0.14257. If each marriage was assumed to have equal fertility, the mean coefficient of consanguinity became 0.03989.
Table 2 gives a detailed analysis of the inbreeding coefficient by generations.

It can be readily seen that the coefficients of inbreeding increased markedly from the III to the VI generation, as would be expected.
F values for a few other populations calculated by Wright's path coefficient method follow. For the Ramah Navaho, Spuhler and Kluckhohn (1953) obtained 0.0066 for generations I to VIII and 0.0080 for generations IV to VIII. Ishikuni et al. (1960) reported a mean inbreeding coefficient of 0.02408 for the entire living population of Hosojima, a small Japanese island, and a value of 0.03341 from the consideration of equalsize sibships for every marriage. The mean F for theSamaritans of Israeland Jordan forall51 living individuals born to those married during and after 1933 was 0.043448, and the mean inbreeding coefficient for inbred individuals was 0.055493 (Bonn<5 1963). On thebasisof four generations, Neel et al. (1964)determined the coefficient of consanguinity for the Xavante Indians of Brazil as 0.0094. Using his newmethod, Mange (1964) reported the mean inbreeding coefficient for 667Hutterites as 0.01216.
To date, the Samaritans are the most inbred population reported, with the Tristanites in second place. By extending the genealogies of the Samaritans beyond 1960,an even larger value for F should result, whereas the Tristanites' contact with off-islanders will have lowered their /""-value since 1938.
An examination of the various factors determining the relatively high degree of inbreeding in Tristan da Cunha indicates that it resulted mainly from:
1. A small founding population of 15 individuals whoincluded two pairs of full sibs and the daughter of one of them.
2. Geographic isolation which markedly reduced gene flow from outside populations.

3. The relatively small number of marriageable individuals at any one point in time, which restricted choice of marriage partner.
4. Absence of effective social restrictions on marriages of first cousins.
In the other groups, as in the Tristanites, the circumstances leading to the high degree of consanguinity are quite diverse. Yet, in a general sense all share a common factor; namely, that man himself defines the rules under which gene transmission takes place. These rules reflect the particular cultural, social, and natural history of the group. The geneticist must therefore be fully aware of a population's history in order to understand its genetic uniqueness.
In 1961 thepopulation of Tristan da Cunha was removed to England as a result of volcanic eruptions on themain island. Subsequently, they returned to the island when the volcanic disturbances subsided in 1962. During their 18 months in England, they underwent an intensive investigation bythe various health disciplines. In the light of their high coefficient of inbreeding, information on their blood groups, anthropometric measurements and variability, immunological responses, recessive diseases, and the like will be an important addition to population studies.
