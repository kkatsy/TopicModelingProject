1. In making a study of differential fertility trends and of the changes taking place therein in the course of time, it should be borne in mind that these trends are influenced by factors of a different nature.
Generally two groups of such factors can be distinguished. First, circumstances of a preponderately objective nature, e.g., factors which, for separate groups of the population lead to differences in the frequency of marriages, in the age at marriage, in the duration of marriages (during the prolific period of the woman), etc. Second, effects of factors of a subjective nature which can be summarized briefly as being the results of birth control. The effect of these factors depends on the attitude of the different groups of the population toward birth control and on the extent to which, actually, the number of children will be restricted by the individuals, i.e., the married couples belonging to each of these groups.
It may be assumed that the former group of factors has always made its influences felt, while the significance of the latter category for trends and changes in differential fertility is only of recent date. For the Netherlands, at any rate, there is no noticeable effect of birth control on the trend of fertility until after the middle of the 1870's, although there are some indications that this factor had already led to some differential fertility.

It is impossible here to go into details about the extent to which each of the above mentioned factors has contributed to the change in fertility. It may be stated briefly that the possibility of such a further analysis depends, inter alia, on the nature of available statistical data. Apparent differences in the crude birth rates will be caused by the objective as well as the subjective factors mentioned above, while the isolated effect of the subjective factors will have to be estimated on the basis of marital fertility rates, inter alia, specified by age of mother and by duration of marriage.
2. Comparison of the trends of fertility of different population groups for the Netherlands can be made on the basis of the results of the Population Censuses of 1930 and 1947. These censuses produced figures1 on the fertility of women married before their 25th birthday and who had been married for more than 20 years on Census day. In this way the minimum duration of marriage was maintained as 20 years, and therefore the comparison to be made on the basis of these figures is reduced to marriages contracted before 1927.
Part A of Chart 1 shows a comparison between urban and rural population based on the above mentioned fertility rates in municipalities having more than 100,000 and fewer than 5,000 inhabitants, respectively. Fertility of marriages occurring be-

marriage cohorts 1922-1926, the deviations from the general average were -f-17 per cent and --22 per cent, respectively. These figures do not show any leveling. Meanwhile it appears that the latter deviations are practically equal to those for the marriage cohorts 1917-1921. Moreover, a comparison between the percentage decline in the fertility of marriages from consecutive periods shows that the pace at which the decline went on during the last part of the whole period under consideration slowed down a trifle in urban districts and was accelerated slightly in rural districts.

It may further be observed that the difference between fertility of Roman Catholic and Protestant marriages from periods after 1911 showed a gradual decrease. However, in proportion to the absolute level of fertility the difference between Roman Catholics and Protestants still increased a little (40-44 per cent).
Part C of Chart 1 shows a comparison between marital fertility trends according to the husband's occupation. The difference between minimum and maximum fertility at the end of the period under review is less than in the beginning, in the abso-

However, there is again hardly any evidence of a lessening difference. Fertility in the marriage cohorts 1906-1910 of agricultural workers was 88 per cent higher than that of the cohorts of the salaried employees, while the corresponding figure for the cohorts 1922-1926 was still 87 per cent.
On the other hand, a leveling can be observed between the marital fertility of salaried employees and wage earners in the period under review. It appears that the maximum difference between these two groups for the marriages taking place in 1896-1900 is: salaried employees 394 and wage earners 685 live births per 100 marriages, i.e., wage earners 74 per cent higher than salaried employees. This margin diminished gradually, and for the marriages concluded in 1922-1926 the ratios were 278 and 378, respectively, i.e. wage earners only 40 per cent higher than salaried employees.
3. For a comparison between the more recent fertility trends of the various groups of the population, use can be made of the data on all existing marriages at the 1947 Census.
A summary of the most important returns is given in Table 1. The marriages occurring in 1924-1928, which could be considered as completed in 1947, have been used as a starting point. In the Census

publication concerned, the fertility of each population group is measured by the number of live births per 100 first marriages with children, contracted in each period. These figures have not been standardized for differences in the age at marriage and in duration of marriage. These differences, however, are more important for the mutual deviations of the levels of fertility of the various population groups than for the trends of fertility of these groups.
In considering the fertility rates of the urban and rural population2, it appears that the fertility of the marriage cohorts 1929-1933 is lower than that of the cohorts 1924-1928. This is quite natural, because these marriages are not yet completed. However, the fertility thus far (up to 1947) achieved by the marriage cohorts 1929-1933, 1934-1938 and 1939-1943 among the rural population in proportion to the fertility of the cohorts 1924-1928 (92, 77 and 53 per cent of it, respectively) lags behind the corresponding ratios for the fertility of the urban marriage cohorts (93, 81 and 62 per cent, respectively, of the fertility of the 1924-1928 cohorts). This still does not mean that similar ratios will exist for the ultimate total fertility of

these rural and urban marriage cohorts, as it is not impossible that procreation in the rural marriage cohorts will continue at such a pace that the arrears, appearing from the above-mentioned ratios, may be made up. Such a development would bring a decline of the fertility of rural marriage cohorts after 1928 at the same rate as that of urban cohorts. In that case there would already be a change in the trend of rural fertility: from figures other than those included in Table 1, it appears that before 1928 the decline in fertility among rural marriage cohorts was slower than that among urban marriage cohorts. Should the arrears of rural cohorts in 1947 shown by the figures mentioned not be fully made up, then this would mean that the decline in fertility among the rural marriage cohorts of the past 20 years had been more rapid than that among the urban cohorts. In this case a tendency toward gradual leveling of the fertility of rural and urban population would be going on.
The same applies to the fertility of the various religious groups. The number of live births until 1947 from the Roman Catholic marriage cohorts 1939-1943 only amounts to 48 per cent of the fertility of the completed Roman Catholic marriage cohorts 1924-1928. For the Protestant and "no religion" cohorts 1939-1943, these percentages are 59 and 64, respectively.
Here also it appears (from unpublished figures) that even though the existing arrears of the Roman Catholic cohorts should be fully made up, there would be a change in the trend, and in such a way that among the group with the highest fertility (Roman Catholic marriages) in the past 20 years a more rapid decline would have taken place than has been registered before. If the arrears have not been fully made up or if there were some slowing-down in the continuing decline in the considerably lower fertility of the Protestant and "no religion" marriage cohorts, the differences in fertility between the vari-

ous religious groups still existing today will gradually become smaller.
The last part of Table 1 contains figures on the fertility of four occupational groups (social classes). They show a picture similar to that of the urban and rural groups and the religious groups. For all occupational groups the fertility of the marriage cohorts after 1928 is less than that of the cohorts 1924-1928. However, here again this is particularly true for the category whose fertility has always been the highest, the agricultural workers.
The fertility of the agricultural marriage cohorts 1939-1943 is thus far (up to 1947) only 50 per_centjQJLthe fertility of the agricultural cohorts 1924-1928. For the marriage cohorts 1939-1943 of professionals and salaried employees, the corresponding percentages are 65 and 63. Here, too, the figures indicate tKäTthediviation between the fertility of these occupational groups is likely to become smaller.
The same development appears for professionals and salaried employees on the one hand and wage earners (without agricultural workers) on the other. Therefore, for these occupational groups there is evidence of further progress toward leveling, which has already been found for these groups in considering marriage cohorts from the periods before 1924-1928.
4. It is not possible in this short paper to enter into further details, e.g., the difference between the fertility trends of various groups of different social level among the Protestants or on different fertility trends of the religious groups among the rural and urban population, or on the influence of the education-level (deviating fertility trends of university graduates), etc.
Such further considerations, however, also support the conclusion already drawn, that on the basis of the data which became available for the years up to 1947, there is a tendency toward a gradual leveling
