Communication
LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Sir: You published recently a review of Les chromosomes
humains (Caryotype normal et variations pathologiques) by Raymond Turpin and Jerome Lejeune, Gauthier-Villars, Paris, 1965 [Eugenics Quarterly, 13: 167-169].
Among his misstatements, J. M. Opitz pretends that some pictures of chromosomes published in this book are "retouched."
More than a simple fault of judgment, this is pure calumny. For the honest information of your readers, it seems necessary to publish this rectification.
