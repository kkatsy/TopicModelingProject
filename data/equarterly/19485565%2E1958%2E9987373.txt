INTERVALS BETWEEN CONFINEMENTS IN THE ABSENCE OF BIRTH CONTROL

ARious STUDIES of historic populations have been carried out on the basis oE family histories, some of which are readily available in the form of genealogies, while others are reconstructed in the course of such research. Using this approach, access is gained to a variety of data; in particular, the intervals between births, a subject much neglected in modern statistical study, are then directly available. Such data, on the other hand, concern populations in which birth control was much less frequently practiced than nowadays. Mostly confined to some segments of the leading classes, the practice was probably unknown to the bulk of the population until the end of the eighteenth century. Studies of the fertility of historic populations, therefore, are likely to produce information about the nature of human reproductivity when biological factors play the dominant part; in fact, this procedure promises to open some clues as to the manner in which these latter factors operate.
In the analysis of fertility here, each family whose history is known appears as a complex entity, with its number of births, and its time sequence of marriage, births, and termination of the marital union. Birth frequencies and family size are simple and current phenomena which have been studied much more frequently than the complex phenomena of this time sequence. The time sequence of births is the topic of this article which, without attempting to deal with the subject comprehensively, presents rather an example of what one may hope to learn from the time analy-

sis of births occurring in particular families. Nature of the Problem
In the absence of birth control children in families of sufficient marriage duration are usually numerous. For each family several distinct intervals between successive births can be noted. Using these data as raw material, an examination can be made of how the several birth intervals vary within the families and from one family to another.
The successive intervals are distinguished by the order of each preceding birth. Variations of birth intervals within the families, however, can scarcely be studied without note being taken of the effect of the birth order, whether regarded as a direct effect, or as an indirect effect of age of the mother or marriage duration, of which birth order is a correlated variable. Interfamily comparisons, furthermore, must be made for birth intervals of the same order, or else the variations due to family differences and those due to birth order differences become confused.
When a large number of observations are available, the best procedure is to analyze variations in birth intervals for completed families only, and separately for families of each given size.
Though preferable, this procedure cannot be used when the number of observations is small. It is then not possible to consider completed families only, nor to study families of each size separately. Even then, it remains necessary to preserve comparability, at least so far as orders of birth

are concerned. As a result, analysis of an aggregate of families having had at least n children permits, at the most, comparisons for the first n -- 1 birth intervals. In practice the comparison must be confined to the first n -- 2 intervals, because of the empirical finding that, in completed families, the last interval tends to be distinctly longer than all others irrespective of the preceding number of children or, in this case, irrespective of the order n of the last birth interval.
Since only the n -- 2 first birth intervals can be compared, n must at least be 3; in fact, it must be more than 3, or else each family in the study is represented by a single birth interval only.
Another complication arises from various observations showing that the interval between two successive confinements tends to be shortened when the child born in the first of these confinements (or all children in the event of a multiple birth) dies very soon, e.g., within its first year of life. Part of the variation between birth intervals, therefore, is attributable to infant mortality. To eliminate this factor, here considered as vitiating, the comparison is confined to intervals where the preceding child (or at least one child in the event of multiple births) has attained at least one year of age. In this case the corresponding interval is called normal.
The Data
From a tally of the parish registers of Crulai (a village in Normandy) for couples married in the years from 1674 to 1742, the family histories have been reconstructed, i.e., at least insofar as these took place within the village of Crulai.1
The families were followed up from marriage to the end of the marital union

by death of one spouse, or up to the last birth prior to the family's emigration from the village. The record is incomplete inasmuch as births may have occurred during a family's temporary absence from Crulai, baptisms may have remained unregistered, or a family history could not be reconstructed for other reasons (e.g., the family being inaccurately identified). Actually, some children for which there was no baptismal record were discovered because there was an eventual record of their death, their marriage, or some other incident revealing their existence. Hence, only such children of unrecorded birth were overlooked whose existence has not otherwise come to light. The number of these latter can be estimated as of a similar magnitude as that of children of unrecorded baptism whose existence was called to attention through some other record. Since these amount to a very small fraction of the total, these data can be regarded as sufficiently accurate.
For this study families were selected in this way. It was found that families with at least 6 confinements were both sufficiently numerous and had enough birth intervals suitable for analysis. Hence, attention was confined to these families. Among these were the following:
1. 32 families whose first 5 birth intervals were normal; excluding the last birth interval from study, these are families with at least 7 confinements.
2. 50 families whose first 4 intervals were normal.
3. 56 families whose first 3 intervals were normal.
As the second group of families is almost as numerous as the third, its study presents relatively greatest interest. These families, therefore, have been selected.
For each family, the average of the four intervals can be calculated, as well as its internal variance, which equals one-third of the sum of squares of deviations from

the mean. Table I shows, for each of the 50 families, the successive 4 normal intervals between births (of order 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, and 4-5), the mean interval, and the estimate of its internal variance. The families have been ranked by ascending order of these variances.
It will be noted that the last 4 families are clearly discontinuous from the 46 preceding ones, in the array of variances: the variance of the 46th family is less than 150, that of the 47th exceeds 275, and that of the 50th amounts to 400.
As stated in the foregoing, a few children have probably escaped from all records; more often than not, this would have occurred in the case of one child only escaping per family, since the chance of discovering--through some other record--at least one child whose date of birth or baptism is not known increases with the number of children escaping in a family. When only one child is omitted, one of the apparent birth intervals is, in reality, the sum of two intervals, other birth intervals being ascertained correctly. A sharp increase of the calculated internal variance is the most likely result in such a case.
That this is so can be demonstrated in a calculation of birth intervals for the group of those families whose first 5 intervals were normal: omitting arbitrarily one of their births, e.g., their fourth, the resulting apparent 4 birth intervals (where an interval 3-4 is substituted for the sum of the actual intervals 3-4 and 4-5) have an array of variances of which two-thirds exceed 150, while more than half are in the range from 150 to 450.
These considerations justify elimination of the last 4 families from the present analysis. The study, therefore, is confined to 46 families whose first 4 intervals between confinements were normal.
Analysis of Variance: Differences by Birth Order
For this limited aggregate, the distribution of birth intervals of successive order

is as follows:

The mean length of the interval increases with the order of birth. Is this a spurious effect, or are the observed differences statistically significant? The same question also arises with respect to differences among individual families.

The internal variances of the aggregate of 46 families can be hypothesized as arising from a population of families which is homogeneous in respect of this variance; an analysis of variance, therefore, is to the point. It furnishes these results:

The ratio of the mean variance among families to the mean variance of the residual is much greater than required at the 5per cent probability level, showing that inter-family differences are significant. The same holds for the ratio of mean variances for birth orders and the residual.
It follows that neither the inter-family nor the intra-family differences of intervals can be explained as merely accidental: if the normal birth intervals, 1-2 to 4-5, could be observed again and again in each family, differences among families, and intervals within the families, will subsist.

In summary: 1. Some couples are more likely than

203

others to bear children within short intervals.
2. Among the families of Crulai intervals between successive confinements tend to increase with the order of birth. The particular birth order has an effect whose real cause might be the preceding number of pregnancies as such, or the age of the mother, since birth order and mother's age are correlated. The small number of observations does not permit ascertaining whether birth order itself, or mother's age, is the principal determinant.
Decreasing, artificially, the intervals 2-3 by 2 months, intervals 34 by 3 months, and intervals 4-5 by 5 months (i.e., by the excess of their averages over the average of interval 1-2), the following distributions are obtained:

The four distributions are now very similar. Graphically speaking, the effect of birth order, or mother's age, results in a wholesale displacement of distributions to the right rather than in a flattening of the curves through widening in the direction of intervals of greater length.
In previous studies of populations practising no birth control, the effect of birth order has seemed to be negligible. This appeared to be the case with families of the leading class of Geneva at the end of the sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth century, and with the French Canadians who married in the early part of the eighteenth century. If the effect of the birth order is not the same among differ-

ent populations, it is probable that it varies also within a given population; in other words, the different families are not equally affected by birth order.
A further extension of this reasoning would lead one to try to account for the spectrum of each family's successive birth intervals by variations of the effect of birth order. Because of the manifold combinations of variations in the several separate intervals, an orderly effect of birth order can scarcely be expected to emerge. From such complex analysis, logical satisfaction could hardly be obtained.
It is more practical to posit some underlying biological mechanism which tends to augment intervals between confinements in direct relation to the number of preceding pregnancies, or the mother's age.
In the absence of birth control, marital fertility and, hence, intervals between confinements depend mainly on three factors.
1. The woman's fecundability, defined as the probability that she will conceive in the course of one menstrual cycle or, say, within one month.
2. The frequency of uninduced miscarriages and still-births, since confinements resulting in live births only are here under consideration.
3. The time lapse between a confinement and the next onset of ovulation.
In the period beginning with a conception and ending with the next onset of ovulation, fecundability is zero. Hence, we are concerned with fecundability in periods other than these.
The biological mechanism suggested here may affect fecundability, the frequency of uninduced abortions, or the time lapse until ovulation is resumed. In the first event, an increasing dispersion and skewness towards long durations is to be expected for intervals of successively high order, in the third instance, birth interval distributions would be displaced towards the right without a significant change in their shapes. In the second of these three possi-

204 Eugenics Quarterly

bilities, both types of effect should appear simultaneously. In other words, a constant shape of the successive birth interval curves occurs only if the biological action is of the third kind. This is very nearly the case observed here. It follows that the biological reason behind these observations seems to be an increasing delay in the resumption of ovulation with successive births.
Other facts lead to the inference that a relation exists between lactation and post-partem sterility. But this relation is subject to widely varying degrees of strictness: it may be nil for some women and absolute for some others; the latter would be women who do not ovulate for as long as they lactate. With women where this relation is absolute, it would appear already at the first confinement, or at an early age, to remain unaltered with successive pregnancies, or with increase in age; except for random effects, an unchanging individual trait is then revealed. With women for which the relation is loose at first, the suggested biological process would tend to strengthen it with time. In other words, the delay of ovulation caused by lactation would appear very early in some women, would tend to increase with successive pregnancies or rising age in others, and finally, perhaps, never arise in some.
Dispersion of the Intra-Family Intervals
Conception is a random process: there is merely a certain probability, called fecundability, that sexual relations will result in a conception. This conception, in turn, has only a certain probability to result in a live birth, or a confinement proper (other than an uninduced abortion, or miscarriage) . The delay in the renewal of ovulation, finally, is subject to random variations.
For these several reasons, the intervals between confinements, or births, in a given family have a random dispersal around the

expected variations resulting from birth order or age.2
This random dispersal is only a part of
the residual variance met in the analysis of
variance. If, as it appears to be, the effect
of birth order or mother's age varies from
one family to another, the residual variance
includes another term due to such varia-
tion (cf. Appendix).
In practice, these two terms cannot be separated; the possible limits can only be set of the variance resulting from random causes, namely 24 and 40, to the nearest integral number. Its square root, the measure of dispersion, then ranges from 4.9 to 6.3 months. If the distribution of deviations approximates the normal, deviations will be smaller than two standard deviations in 95 per cent of the cases. In other words, the normal interval between successive confinements will only exceptionally deviate by more than 10 to 13 months from its expected value. But the expected value remains unknown.
Instead of dispersals around unknown expected values, the differences can be considered between any two consecutive intervals. The random variance about these differences is twice that considered in the foregoing, and the corresponding standard deviation is of between 7 and 9 months. So long as birth order, or age, has no effect, the absolute difference between two consecutive normal birth intervals should not exceed from 14 to 18 months in more than 5 per cent of the cases (it being assumed that the difference between successive intervals is likewise normally distributed.)
2 Let it be assumed that fecundability outside the period of pregnancy and post-partem sterility is constant, equal to p; at the next onset of ovulation it equals qp, where q = 1 -- p; at the third, it is q2p, and so forth. The number of ovulations before a conception occurs averages 1/p, with a variance equal to q/p2. To this variance is added that of the number of ovulations which will not occur because of a conception; the latter variance depends, for a given woman, on variations in the duration of pregnancies and in the delay in resumption of part-partem ovulation.

205

In practice, of course, those differences
between successive intervals will not be
observed which result if birth order were
of no effect. But the average effect of birth
order, or mother's age, can be eliminated
in terms of the difference in the means of
the intervals. The variance about the dif-
ferences is now no longer twice the sum of
the variance caused by random processes
and the variation caused by birth order; it is smaller3 but still exceeds twice the vari-
ance from random causes only.
Assuming deviations in the observed dif-
ferences about their mean to be normally
distributed, their absolute value should not
exceed in more than 5 per cent of the cases
a value between x and 18 months, where x
is greater than 14 and smaller than, if not
equal to, 18.
The absolute difference, with respect to
mean values, between intervals 1-2 and 2-3,
and between intervals 3-4 and 4-5, is distributed as follows:4
3 The effect of birth order on a given interval is positively correlated with the effect of birth order on the subsequent interval.
4 This distribution has been obtained as follows: 1. All intervals, in completed months, 1-2 are increased by the nearest integral number of months of the difference between the mean of interval 2-3 and the mean of interval 1-2; the same is done with the pair of intervals 3-4 and 4-5. 2. For each family the difference between interval 1-2 thus increased, and interval 2-3 is taken. The same is done with respect to intervals 3-4 and 4-5. 3. The distribution of these gross differences (i.e., in completed months) is then tabulated. The first (zero) are differences in true value smaller than 1 month; the second (1) are differences of from 1 day to 1 month and 29 days (for months having 30 days), etc. The distribution in true value (actual nearest integral number of months) is obtained by adding to the above category "zero" one-half the number in the above category " 1 , " for the new 1-month category; for the remaining categories, the arithmetic mean of the corresponding gross categories (completed months) is taken in each instance for the new category (nearest integral number of months).
The distribution so obtained cannot very strictly be a normal distribution; actually, in the present instance, it differs only slightly from a normal distribution.

An absolute difference of 18 or more months occurs in fewer than 4 per cent of the cases, but in nearly 16 per cent of the cases differences are of 14 or more months; the difference corresponding to the 5 per cent level falls well within the limits which have been conceived but is near the upper of the two limits.

Inter-family differences
The distribution of intra-family means of the first 4 normal intervals is the following:

but is only slightly so, the median interval being 26.2 months. It can still, somewhat roughly, be assumed that 95 per cent of the cases occur in a range of 4 standard deviations centered about the mean, i.e., between 14 and 40 months. In the present instance, this range in fact covers more than 95 per cent of the cases, only one observation falling without it.
The estimated variance of the mean of the 4 intervals is the sum of:
1. the variance of the expected value of the mean
2. one-quarter the variance due to random processes
The first of these has been put between the limits 33.1 and 37.1 (cf. Appendix) ; the corresponding standard deviations are 5.75 and 6.1 months. The limits are close, and 6 may be substituted as an approximate estimate.
For each family, there is an expected value of the mean of the first four intervals, characterizing the couple's procreative ability;5 this shall be referred to as the characteristic interval. Its mean is estimated at 27 months, the rounded arithmetic mean of the 46 observed intra-family means of the first four normal intervals. We can presume that the distribution of this characteristic interval approximates the normal; accordingly, the characteristic interval will only rarely be either smaller than 15, or larger than 39, months. In other words, for the families of Crulai which have had 6 or more children, the interval characterizing their procreative ability is practically contained within a range extending by two years, from about \yz years to about 3i/£ years.
The lower limit of the characteristic interval corresponds to women whose ovulation is resumed no later than 6 months

after termination of pregnancy. Even then, fecundability would have to be practically equal to unity. With only average fecundability, a characteristic interval of only 15 months implies a very rapid resumption of ovulation. The upper limit of the range corresponds to women of either low fecundability or long periods after confinement before ovulation is resumed.
Observations other than those presented here tend to confirm that this range of procreative ability reflects very largely the range in delays of post-partem resumption of ovulation.6 Since, in a rural environment, women ordinarily breast-feed their children, the varying delays in the resumption of ovulation reflect variations in the influence of lactation on ovulation, as well as variations in the length of the period of lactation. Women with the shortest characteristic intervals show no effect of lactation on ovulation. Women with long characteristic intervals not only prolong lactation over a considerable period but also show a prolonged interference of lactation with ovulation.
Summary
For the present study use has been made of data on 46 families found at Crulai, a village in Normandy, between 1674 and 1742. These 46 families have had at least 6 children, and their first 4 intervals between confinements were normal (i.e., the child born at the last previous confinement has lived for at least 12 months). By the procedure adopted, the effect of infant mortality on birth intervals has been eliminated.
This small sample has sufficed to reveal that birth order, or mother's age, has a certain effect, and that there is a very clear variation in procreative ability among families.

Intervals between successive confinements

tend to increase with the order of confine-

ment; the increase is by about 5 months,

i.e., by about one-fifth, from the interval

between the first and second birth to the

interval between the fourth and fifth birth.

This increase appears to be attributable to

cause

and,

may, conceivably, be the real cause; but the

cause may also be the age of the mother,

birth order and age being correlated. The

data do not bear out which of the two is

the principal factor.

This effect of birth order, or of age, has

not been observed so far in the study of

historic populations. It is probable that

the effect is also variable among the indi-

vidual families of Crulai. Intra-family va-

nations of birth intervals, at any rate, are

mainly caused by random processes. The

standard deviation from random causes is

One of 5 or 6 months, and the coefficient of

variation is of the order of 20 per cent,

APPENDIX
Let » be the number of families studied, regarded as a sample drawn from an infinite population of families (population matrix). Let #,y denote the normal interval between confinementsof orders y and j + 1 in family /' (where / varies from 1 to », and./ from 1 to 4).
Xijdepends on several factors: the family /, the order./, and chance. The effect of birth order may be common to all families, but may also vary from one family to another; the effect may even be absent in some families and more than average in some others. But since for each family the same normal intervals (i.e. the first four) are considered, the effect of birth order may be regarded as nothing more than the difference, relative to the expected value of the mean of the first 4 intervals, in the expected value of the interval between confinements of order j and./ + 1. If this effect be denoted by r¿y, then ]C>r»ï = 0-
i
Denoting by #< the expected value of the mean of the first 4 intervals of family /, and by £</ a random variable of expected value zero, one may write:

We use the following notation:
x is the mean of #,- in the sample of» families, £i is the mean of the observed first four normal intervals of family ;', Xj is the mean of the observed » intervals of order j , x is the general mean of all observed intervals, £<is the mean of £,y in family /', iy is the mean of f.-y in respect of birth order./, i is the general mean of all values of f¿y r¡ is the mean of the » effects, r<y, in respect of birth order j .

209 The following relations hold:
Xi - Xi + £,-, Xj = X + Tj + |y,
X= X+ I In the analysis of variance, the sum of squares of deviations among families equals:
We denote by Vz the variance of #,· in the population matrix and by V( the variance of £; the expected value of the sum of squares equals:
The sum of squares of deviations in respect of birth order equals:
We denote by Vr the variance of ry in the population matrix; the expected value of the sum of squares of deviations among birth orders equals:
The total variance is calculated as follows:

hence:

53 p,y2 equals (K -- 1) times the variance of the effect of birth order j . Let us designate

as Vp the mean of the four variances corresponding to the 4 birth orders, 1 to 4. The expected value of the sum of squares equals:

4(» - \)VX + 4(» - \){Vr + VP) + (4» -

By subtraction one obtains the sum of squares in respect of the residual variation, which equals:

The residual variation, thus, depends on the random factor and on the inter-family variation of the effect of the birth order.
The 4 variances, Vz, Vr, Vp, and V(, are interrelated by three linear equations; furthermore, unless zero, they all must be positive; any combination of four positive values or zero satisfying the three equations is a solution. One such solution is obtained by making Vp equal zero : this corresponds to the case where the effect of birth order is the same for every family. This assumption, which is implausible, would result in a maximum of V(.

Another limit of V$ is obtained on the assumption that the effect of birth order is in the same direction, but of varying intensity, among the several families. In this event, such decreases in birth intervals as one might observe from one order to the next can result only from randomness in the rates of conception and accidental variations in the lapse of time until renewal of the ovulation.
To take these into account, let us use that expression of the variance which is based on the squares of differences, within each of two pairs of observed values, instead of the squares of deviations about the mean.
Let there be n observed values, xi ·· · x¡ · · · Xu· · · xn, with x their mean, then:
From this, the variance, V, is estimated:
E E to-
Thus, for each family the internal variance can be calculated by dividing by 12 the sum of the 6 differences within each of two pairs of the 4 observed normal intervals; the mean internal variance is then equal to the mean of the 46 values so obtained.
Let us consider family / and orders./ and k, where j < k. One may write: àx = xik -- Xij = rik --ru + £,·* -- I,-,- = Ar + A£.
By assumption, r is positive or zero. When àx is negative, Aj must also be negative so that, denoting negative variances by A,, :
| An£ | = | A,,* | + Ar > | The distribution of A£ is symmetrical, the pair of random differences, & and {/ occurring with equal likelihood as the pair £,-, £t. For negative variations in x, due to negative differences An?, there are an equal number of positive variations in x, due to opposite differences in A£. One may then write:
For the 46 families under consideration, 2EE(A,,x)2 = 13162,
hence, 13162
Likewise, V% ^ 39.7 On the other hand, since n = 46,
45(4P, + Vi) = 7747 3F( = 619 135 Ff = 5360.

211
Hence, finally, 23.8 ^ Vi ^ 39.7 33.1 ^ V. ^ 37.1 2.8 ^ Vr ^ 3.0 0 ^ Vp ^ 11.9.
intra-family intervals vary from two sources: random sources with variance Vt; and the effect of birth order which varies among families. The variance of the latter is Vr + Vp. The latter sum, rounded to the nearest integer, is between 3 and 15.
Variations due to birth order are small relative to dispersals caused by chance.
