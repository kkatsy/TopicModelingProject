CASTE AND CONSANGUINITY IN ANDHRA PRADESH

K. R. DRONAMRAJU Department of Genetics

Andhra Pradesh is a southeastern state of India inhabited by 35 million Teluguspeaking people. They are of special interest to a population geneticist because of their marked preference for consanguineous marriages. Dronamraju and Meerakhan (1960) were the first to publish data on the incidence of various types of consanguineous marriages in Andhra Pradesh. As both the investigators are natives of Andhra Pradesh and speak Telugu fluently, it was possible to record the complex relationships in the original language, and the hazards of interpretation were thus eliminated. The mean coefficient of inbreeding (autosomal) was .02 in the coastal districts, inhabited by at least 10 million people, and the most frequent type of consanguineous marriage was with a maternal uncle's daughter (known as Menarikam in Telugu). These observations were confirmed by later work, and it was reported further that the coefficient of inbreeding among parents of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis was significantly raised (Dronamraju, 1963; 1964a, b; Dronamraju and Meerakhan 1961; 1963a, b). A special feature in the findings was that uncle-niece marriages occurred in 7.2% of the total number of marriages investigated.
CASTE AND CONSANGUINITY
It was pointed out elsewhere that the rigidity of the caste system was perhaps ensured by encouraging consanguineous marriages, because endogamy within a

subcaste is the most important factor that has preserved the caste system (Dronamraju, 1964b). Other factors, sociological and economic, help to maintain the high rate of consanguinity even today. Two factors common for both Indian and Japanese populations are: (a) childhood betrothals, and (b) economic reasons (Ichiba, 1953). The latter, in Andhra Pradesh, may include the facility of giving a smaller dowry (sometimes none at all) by the bride's parents in a consanguineous marriage.
The caste system in the twentieth century is no longer so rigid as before. We are seeing the rapid breaking up of a long established mating system that has been in existence for at least 3500 years. The grandest genetic experiment at the human population level, although perhaps not deliberately designed as such, is coming to an end (see Dobzhansky, 1962, p. 234). Thus, it is important to study this population before the mating system becomes as random as in Europe or North America.
The breaking up of the caste isolates is followed by an expected decline in the consanguinity rate. The trend in consanguinity rates is shown in Table 1. The decline, especially since 1950, is significant (xi2 = 7.438).
In recent investigations it was found that the percentage of consanguinity is significantly lower in the two higher groups of the social order, namely Brahmans and Kshatriyas. In Table 2, marriages from the two higher Varnas are

pooled and compared with the consanguinity in the two lower groups. The difference between the two groups is significant (Xl2 = 6.202). In the traditional society it is difficult to imagine sociological reasons for lower rates among, say, Brahmans than in Komatis (Vaisyasand Sanskrit). Economic causes are ruled out because Komatis, comprised of merchants and traders, have generally been richer than the priests and scholars of the Brahman caste, and, judging from the social background of contemporary marriages, one should expect Brahmans to have higher rates of consanguinity. Thus, it seems certain that the difference in consanguinity rates between higher and lower Varnas observed today is due to the fact that the former are more prone to be influenced by modern factors than the latter. It is obvious that higher education and economic and employment opportunities have had a greater impact on the higher castes. Urbanization and literacy are

negatively correlated with high rate of consanguinity (Dronamraju and Meerakhan, 1961; Sanghvi, 1966).
FUTURE PROSPECTS
The late Professor J. B. S. Haldane urged (Haldane, 1963) that research in human population genetics should be undertaken quickly in the undeveloped countries because such countries
may go through a stage where infectious diseases are still prevalent, and ancient sexual customs little altered, but yet some members of the population either within or without the medical profession, are genetically educated. . . The critical stage, before the advent of modern hygiene and changes in marriage customs, but after the advent of geneticists, may last for only a short time; sometimes less than ten years. If this time is not utilized irreplaceable information may be lost, which would be of great value in planning the future in developed countries and even greater in those which are now undeveloped.
Haldane suggested that such research be conducted mainly by people of the same race and traditions as their subjects, and, I would add, by those who speak the same language, because the differences in language and other cultural factors between two states in India are often as great as those between two countries in Europe.

As both consanguinity rate and the incidence ofinfectious disease arerapidly declining in countries like India, it is important to utilize the existing mating systems for an evaluation of the importance of consanguinity in theetiology of infectious disease. The significant excess of consanguineous parentage among those suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis is of considerable interest. It is also important to study the children of intercaste marriages to determine whether they arein any way inferior or superior to the general population. Furthermore, such studies could be designed tounderstand such basic problems in human genetics as components of genetic load, as well as to benefit the improvement of public health in the population.
