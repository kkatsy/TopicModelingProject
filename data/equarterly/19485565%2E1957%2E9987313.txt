IT HAS OFTEN BEEN EMPHASIZED, most re-
cently by Planansky (37), Schulz (48) and others, that the evaluation by a psychiatrist of the genetic theory of schizophrenia is neither a matter of personal conviction nor a measure of loyalty to a certain school of training and thought. As in every other case of unclear etiology, the decision to accept or reject the genetic hypothesis should depend on the type of evidence accumulated and on the soundness of the conclusions drawn from these data.
The significant part played by nongenetic influences in the pathoplastic and psychodynamic aspects of schizophrenia has been discussed in previous reviews. Since that part has never been minimized by a geneticist of the modern variety, this review will be limited to studies concerned with the genetic elements in the etiology of schizophrenia. Apart from seeking an answer to the question of whether or not there is sufficient evidence for a genetic determinant or predisposing factor in this type of psychosis, an attempt will be made to review the historical development of genetic investigations in this area, how much is known about the heredity factor at this point, and how many problems are still unsolved.
Throughout this review, it may be helpful to keep in mind that from a genetic viewpoint a deviant behavior pattern is not considered as the result of a simple genotype-phenotype relationship, reducible to an aggregate of well-defined and easily differentiated interacting influences. A

psychotic behavior pattern is not simply regarded as the concomitant of a fixed congenital aberration any more than it is thought of as a self-limited error in homeostasis, or an unfortunate episode in adjustment. Genetically, a psychosis is viewed as a complex and continuous process in the biological history of the individual.
This general principle has been expressed by Planansky as follows:
"Simply ascertaining the presence or absence of psychosis in members of a family for the purposes of statistical analysis is apt to bring forth only partial information on outwardly observable characteristics of lives whose biological uniqueness remains unknown. The study of heredity and environment in human lives is facilitated by a dynamic concept of constitution, based on genie endowment. Continuous adaptive changes take place as new, genetically determined functions in their appropriate time enter into the individual's physiology, in order to fulfill life according to the image of the species in the prevailing environment. The cumulative effect of adaptive responses to environment in effect becomes incorporated into constitutional potentialities."
Methods of Genetic Investigation
The implications of this broad biological principle make it desirable to begin with a review of the methodological and historical aspects of genetic investigations in psychiatry. For obvious reasons, the technical and conceptual difficulties inherent

in population studies are particularly pronounced in this field.
1. The simplest and by far the oldest procedure is the pedigree or family history method. Even in the pre-Mendelian period --that is, long before the disease entity called dementia praecox had been established (1895)--many case reports were placed on record, which aimed at confirming the commonplace notion that psychoses tend "to run in families." Unfortunately, in a mental disorder which is as common and symptomatologically diversified as schizophrenia, the statistical value of such studies, quite popular until the early 1900s, is extremely limited. These limitations are not so much due to a lack of Mendelian orientation, which began to assert itself in the early 20th century, as they are due to the fact that older case reports were usually restricted to "interesting" family cases, loaded with what was ascribed to heredity, in order to prove the point. Obviously, however, the observation of a large number of schizophrenics in a given family, while suggestive of a gene-specific mechanism, does not rule out such other causes, as an unknown type of infection, psychic contagion, some special dietary or climatic deficiency, unusual stress factors, or the like.
2. The need of studying the heredity problems of schizophrenia in statistically representative and clinically homogeneous samples was recognized first by Riidin (40), whose classical monograph "Zur Vererbung und Neuentstehung der Dementia Praecox," was published in 1916. In the procedure developed by Riidin and his school, especially by Weinberg (60), Brugger (5), Kattentidt (23), Luxenburger (29) and Schulz (45), the statistically corrected expectancy (or prevalence) of schizophrenia in the general population was compared with that observed in different groups of relatives of schizophrenics.
Using this method, named the contingency method of statistical prediction, Riidin conducted the first study of a sample

of sibs and half-sibs of schizophrenics, that was later re-examined by Schulz as well as by Luxenburger (1930). Hoffman (13), Gengnagel (11), and Oppler (33) studied small groups of children of schizophrenics, while other investigators [Schulz (44), Walker (59), Konstantinu (25)] obtained comparable data on nephews and nieces, great nephews and great nieces, and first cousins. Kallmann's (16) first survey was focused on the expectancy of schizophrenia in a large group of descendants of schizophrenics and their sibs. All of these studies were completed by the mid-1980s. With respect to general population samples, that is, the ascertainment of schizophrenia rates for the general population, improved methods were subsequently devised by English and Scandinavian workers, notably by Essen-Moller (8), Fremming (9), Larsson and Sjogren (27), Slater (52), and Stromgren (57). Every one of these studies showed a significant difference between familial concentration and general prevalence of schizophrenia, with an increase in crude or statistically corrected expectancy rates observed in the different categories of relatives investigated, as they approach the schizophrenic family member in degree of genetic similarity. Considering the quantity as well as the quality of these studies, only some of which have been mentioned, and in view of their unanimity in this respect, it is highly improbable that further investigations will materially alter the pattern of distribution as indicated by this type of study.

The following is a range of the expectancy rates found by various observers in the different categories of relationship to schizophrenic probands:

General population

0.85%

Half siblings

7-8%

Full siblings

5-15%

with most investigators agreeing that the inci-

dence is over 10%

Children (of one index case)

8-16%

Children (of two index cases)

study for a minimum of five years. The range of schizophrenia rates found
in twin studies is as follows:

Concordance in dizygotic twins (one twin being

the index case)

3.3-16.7%

Concordance in monozygotic twins (one twin

being the index case)

66.6-86.2%

It is again worthy of emphasis that all investigators observed a significant increase in concordance from two-egg to one-egg twins. Of equal importance was the finding that the expectancy of the dizygotic twin of a schizophrenic proband proved to be approximately the same as that of other sibs (10-15 per cent), regardless of the fact that twins usually share the same environment at a comparable age.

Mode of Inheritance
None of the investigators who used either the contingency method or the twin study method was able to explain the increased incidence in the various categories of relatives of schizophrenics without assuming the existence of some genetic factor. In many studies attention was paid to economic status, to the frequency of sharing the milieu of an affected person, and to other facets of the individual's life conditions. Twin studies took into account such factors as order of birth, prematurity and birth weight, breast feeding, rate of infant development, intelligence, and handedness. None of these factors was found to be significantly associated with the occurrence of the psychotic process.
With the data requiring the assumption of a predispositional factor, the investigators felt obliged to explain its mode of transmission. Early observers were handicapped by the fact that the concepts of penetrance, expressivity, and modifying genes had not yet been formulated. In other words, they attempted to explain empirical findings according to simple Mendelian laws alone. Thus, Rudin, in 1916, suggested two recessive genes to be responsible. This theory was based on his finding a rate of less than 5 per cent for schizophrenia among the sibs of his index cases

in his first analysis. However, the same material when later reviewed by Schulz and Luxenburger yielded a considerably higher sib rate. A few years later, Hoffmann proposed either a two- or a threefactor type of recessive inheritance. About the same time, Kahn (15) expressed the belief in his monograph on schizophrenia and schizoid personality that the genetic mechanism seemed to be the same for both conditions. He thought of a dominant mode of inheritance, because of an apparently equal distribution of schizoid personality types among sibs and children. Later, in the 1930s, Kallmann assumed that a single unit factor was responsible for all clinical forms of schizophrenia, because of the observation of similar and dissimilar clinical forms of the disease in the same family. He believed this factor to be autosomal-recessive and subject to modification by other genes conferring a greater or lesser degree of resistance upon the individual. Especially in Germany during the 1930s a simple dominant mode of inheritance was favored and became the basis for eugenic sterilization laws. Since that time, it has been recognized that a recessive transmission is more likely. There are, however, a few old-timers such as Lenz (28), Roller (24), Slater (54) and Book (3) who still support the theory of dominance.
Corroborative evidence for a recessive hypothesis would require a greater frequency of the disease in the sibs of an index case than in his children--if random mating is assumed, an increased frequency among the children of consanguineous parents, and a high frequency of the disease in collateral lines. While comparative studies of sibs and children have been inconclusive in this respect, there appears to be a positive correlation between incidence of schizophrenia and consanguinity of parents. Weinberg and Lobstein (62), in a study of the Jewish population of Amsterdam, found a significantly higher percentage of schizophrenia in the siblings of index

cases whose parents were cousins, than among those whose parents were not related. This difference was observed although there were no cases of schizophrenia in any of the 27 parental cousin couples. In 211 twin index pairs without schizophrenia in their known ancestry, Kallmann found that 5.7 per cent originated from consanguineous parental matings. In some Scandinavian studies an increase in cousin marriages in the parents of schizophrenics was also reported. Collateral line investigations consistently yielded an expectancy rate in excess of that of the general population.
Those investigators holding to the dominant hypothesis base their belief on the reports of an equal or greater expectancy if the children of index cases are compared with their sibs, and on complex statistical comparisons of empiric figures. Since the rates found are known to be minimum rates for some categories of relationship and are subject to variability because of methodological difficulties, one wonders if conclusions based on formulae which treat these figures as absolutes are justified. It may also be noted that in the statistical treatment of such expectancy rates, random mating is assumed. In the light of modern psychiatric theories regarding mate selection, this assumption seems to be open to question.
Moreover, proponents of either mode of inheritance are forced to utilize auxiliary hypotheses. Kallmann believes in a single recessive factor as the main gene whose expression is modified by the action of other genes. According to Penrose, this is.a multifactor type of inheritance, and in the opinion of Schulz, too, most people are multiple carriers, but there is one dominant gene without which schizophrenia cannot appear; others postulate a dominant gene with markedly reduced penetrance in the heterozygous state. Upon close scrutiny, however, the various theories and their auxiliary hypotheses have a good deal in common in spite of their apparent diver-

gence. The need to extrapolate from empiric data, related to a prolonged and not yet clearly understood series of interactions, precludes the formulation of a precise theory. The diversity of the theories advanced would seem to indicate that until the pathophysiologic nature of the inherited vulnerability factor is identified, theories as to the exact mode of its inheritance will remain inconclusive. For assistance in this work, geneticists look hopefully to the biochemist.
Other unsolved genetic problems of schizophrenia have to do with the homogeneity and specificity of the schizophrenic genotype. Homogeneity refers to the question of whether schizophrenia is one entity derived from one genotype, or merely a phenotypic syndrome expressing various genetic combinations. With regard to specificity, the question arises, on the one hand, whether the genes predisposing to schizophrenia may not also predispose to other pathological behavior patterns, or, on the other, whether the genes are so specific that only Kraepelinian sub-forms of the disease are thus determined. The data available with respect to these questions are conflicting, and absolute answers have not yet been found.
It should be noted, however, that while many aspects of the genetics of schizophrenia remain as yet unclear, the results of genetic studies have served as a valuable point of departure for investigations in the fields of biochemistry and clinical psychiatry. An open mind towards the genetic theory of schizophrenia has led to interesting formulations concerning its essential psychodynamics. Most notable in this field is the work of Dr. Sandor Rado (38) and his school, who deserve credit for the attempt to explore the basic psychological organization of the genetically defined "schizotype."
