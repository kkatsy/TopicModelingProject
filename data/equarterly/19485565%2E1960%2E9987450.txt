ECONOMIC IMPACT OF INSTRUCTION IN FAMILY PLANNING A Proposal to the Japanese National Railways

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:26 08 December 2015

YOSHIO KOYA
Consultant in Family Planning Japanese National Railways

The object of the family-planningmovement is not only to regulate numbers of children but also to promote thereby the welfare and prosperity of the families induced to cooperate in the drive.
The Japanese National Railways (JNR) is pushing this movement forward, in order to improve the health and well-being of the families of its employees, which in turn will induce the employees to devote themselves wholeheartedly to the performance of their duties. This would mean that the work efficiency of the JNR staff will be raised and safe operation of trains, which is one of the main objectives of a railway carrier as a public utility, ensured.
It was in 1956 that the JNR joined this movement and set about giving its employees instruction in family planning. Since then about 65,000 families have thus been instructed.
The plan is to push forward this drive still further and see that all the families of the employees, numbering about 240,000 couples, receive such instruction.
Below is given an estimate of the results of family-planning instruction likely to be obtained in the event such instruction is carried out in the JNR in the future according to plan; an outline of the results thus far obtained is also given.

Needless to say, the instruction referred to has its impact on the recipients mentally as well as materially, but the statistical figures attached hereto are intended to indicate only the economic effect of such instruction. In other words, the figures are intended to represent the extent of the economic benefits that have been received, or are to be received, by the JNR management, the Mutual Aid Association of JNR Employees, and individual employees.
PROCEDURE FOR CALCULATION
During the two-year period from 1956 to 1958, 4,294 families were given individual instruction three times or more. Using the results obtained in this experiment calculations were made to find out how far the expenses of the management, association and employees were reduced owing to the decrease of the number of childbirths, cases of induced abortion, etc.
This will be followed by an estimate of the possible results of family-planning instruction to be applied to all families of married male employees of the JNR.
RESULTS
The reduction in the number of childbirths, cases of induced abortion and cases of miscarriage, as revealed in the survey made of 4,294 families that were

212

given necessary instruction and guidance three times or more during the period 1956-1958, is shown in Table 1.
How the figures given in Table 1 are reflected in the reduction of expense is shown in Table 2. It will be noted from Table 2 that the management of the JNR saved in one year 1,384,848 yen in terms of family allowance and the Mutual Aid Association, 2,451,406 yen in terms of delivery expense, nursing allowance, cost of induced abortion and cost involved in miscarriage, while the annual reduction in the pecuniary burden of the employees totaled 6,944,846 yen. In other words, the family-planning guidance as given to the 4,294 families has resulted in an annual saving of more than 10 million yen.
If it is to be assumed that the families of all JNR married employees from 26 to 45 years old are given the sort of guidance and instruction in family planning which has hitherto been given, then the number of childbirths, cases of induced abortion, etc., would be reduced as shown in Table 3 and an annual saving of 602,000,000 yen be effected, as is shown in Table 4.
It may be added that the figures given in the tables represent the results of one year. If and when guidance is to be given continually on a permanent basis, the results to be obtained would be incalculably effective.
Since all this means a definite alleviation of the monetary burden of the JNR employees, it may be safely averred that the family-planning movement should be pushed forward vigorously, as never before, if only for the promotion of the welfare of JNR employees.
(This survey was made on the basis of the data prepared by the Medical Section, Welfare Department, Japanese National Railways.)
