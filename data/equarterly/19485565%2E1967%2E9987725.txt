POPULATION OF THE CAHUILLA INDIANS: DECLINE AND ITS CAUSES

The impact of white civilization on Indian society in California was severe. Initially all groups suffered a decline in population. Eventually many disappeared altogether. Cook (1943) has estimated the aboriginal population of California to have been approximately 135,00 people at the time the Spaniards began to settle the area in the late eighteenth century.1 Cook's estimate is based upon a careful examination and appraisal of available source materials for central and northern California. For southern California, however, he accepted Kroeber's estimates. In the case of the Cahuilla, Kroeber estimated an aboriginal population of 2,500, although he did not indicate the empirical bases of this estimate (Kroeber, 1925). While the Cahuilla thus represented less than 2% of the total aboriginal population of California, by 1890 the surviving Cahuilla constituted 7 to 9% of the surviving Indian population. In other words, they survived early white contact in proportionately greater numbers than most other Indian groups. Moreover, the reduction in their population that did occur took place in the late nineteenth century alter the period of great population decline experienced by other groups. The purpose of the present paper is to examine the evidence for estimating the size of the aboriginal Cahuilla population and to determine the rate and possible causal factors involved in its decline.
1 This estimate does not include the Modoc, Paiute, and Colorado River tribes.

The Cahuilla inhabited three distinct regions in southern California (Fig. 1). The first of these embraced the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa mountain ranges. The second consisted of San Gorgonio Pass, the area around the entrance to the Pass on the eastern side, and the northern fringe of the Colorado Desert. The third was the region today known as the Coachella Valley, a part of the Colorado Desert. The total amount of territory attributed to the Cahuilla on most tribal and linguistic maps of California is somewhat over 5000 square miles, of which approximately 600 pertained to the Mountain Cahuilla, 650 to the Pass branch, and 3800 to the Desert branch. In this vast area, their habitation sites were widely scattered and generally isolated. Desert or mountains separated them from neighboring groups on all sides except in the extreme northwest where the Pass Cahuilla did come into intimate contact with the Serrano.
On the desert, life flourished in small oases possessing natural springs or wells dug by the Cahuilla themselves. Among the foothills of the mountain ranges on the western side of the desert, habitable sites were limited to the high-walled canyons with perennial streams. In the mountains, villages were nestled in small, well-watered canyons where privacy was imposed by the rugged relief so characteristic of these ranges.
In this habitat, the Cahuilla depended primarily upon gathering wild plant products for their sustenance.

Figure 1. The Cahuilla Area, 1850's. Inset shows location in southern California.

Despite the desolate appearance of the area, so abundant were the natural yields in some localities that the local Cahuilla group could live for long periods of time off a relatively few small parcels of land. vEach group had its permanent village and outlying gathering tracts to which it would repair in certain seasons. More than 60 varieties of plants were used by the Cahuilla for food (Barrows, 1900). Hunting was also an important activity, and a large number of animals contributed to their larder. By the time the United States acquired California in 1848, the Cahuilla were also practicing agriculture to a limited extent, but this was probably unknown to them in aboriginal times.2
2 Captain Lovell commented that "the soil is but little cultivated by this tribe, they being by nature an indolent and improvident people,

The Cahuilla were organized into patrilineal clans. Each clan occupied a distinct locality and its property rights were recognized by other clans. Leadership was vested in a single individual, who either inherited the office from his father or was elected to it by the clan members. Marriage was prohibited between clan members and also between members of the same moiety. Each Cahuilla clan belonged to either the Wildcat or Coyote moiety, and the
devote but little time, or labor to agricultural pursuits. Their principal productions are corn, melons, and squashes, and these to a limited extent . .." (Lovell, 1854). Although this agricultural complex was native to the Indian farmers of the Colorado River and is "typical," the same complex seems to have been introduced to the coastal Indians by the Spaniards. For the Cahuilla, it could have been aboriginal or acquired from the Spaniards. Native peoples, and perhaps among them, the Cahuilla, were receiving instruction in agriculture by their own request at the San Bernardino asistencia.

primary function of the moiety was the regulation of marriage.
In the 1850's, there were about 50 named, localized lineages or branch clans (Strong, 1929). A clan might consist of a single, localized lineage or several of them. The local group, lineage, branch clan, or single-lineage clan appears to have averaged 50 to 60 persons. The larger clans, with several collateral lineages, could range upwards of 200 or 250 people. Among the Desert Cahuilla, the collateral lineages or branch clans tended to be clustered close together, giving the appearance of a single settlement. Among the Mountain and Pass groups, however, the collaternal lineages or branch clans tended to be quite widely separated from each other, and as such, were discrete communities. Cahuilla settlements, therefore, ranged in size from a few houses to relatively large villages. The smaller communities were most frequently called rancherias, and this term is perhaps still the most useful one to distinguish them from the larger villages. There was a definite trend in all areas toward consolidating and forming larger communities after the Cahuilla came into contact with Americans.
Although the Spaniards passed through the area as early as 1774, their effect on the Cahuilla can be assessed only indirectly. We have only one brief mention of Cahuilla population from this early period. When the Anza Expedition passed through Coyote Canyon in 1774, Anza noted in his diary that they had passed more than 200 Indians in the canyon, or about the same number that were there in the 1850's (Bolton, 1930). In other words, the size of at least one Cahuilla locality seems to have remained unchanged during the years that affected so many other Indian groups.

Cook has stated, "There is no reason to suppose that the tribes outside mission influence suffered any diminution in this period" (Cook, 1943). While the Cahuilla did not completely escape mission influence, they were on the periphery of the orbits of San Luis Rey and San Gabriel missions, and the vast majority of them still had not become Christians by the 1850's. Until the census books of San Luis Rey Mission are located, if indeed they ever are, it is impossible to ascertain exactly how many Cahuilla were eventually included in the population of that mission. However, the probable effect of the mission can be judged by other means. San Luis Rey was not founded until 1798, and the missionaries did not begin to penetrate the interior seeking new converts until 1816 when the Pala asistencia was established. By 1826 mission activity began to decline, and in 1834 it ceased altogether with the decree of secularization of the missions. Thus there were only a few years during which the Cahuilla were likely to have been brought into the mission in any numbers. Also, we know that San Luis Rey had the lowest death rate of any of the missions.
Some Cahuilla are listed in the San Gabriel mission books. This mission established an asistencia at San Bernardino in 1819. Most of the neophytes connected with this asistencia were Serrano, and such Cahuilla as there were seem to have been largely from the Pass branch. Mission activity at San Bernardino ceased in 1835 when theasistencia was attacked and burned by a party of Cahuilla and Serrano.
In northern and central California, two of the most important factors contributing to the decline of the nonmissionized Indians were epidemics and punitive campaigns (Cook, 1943). In

contrast, southern California, in general, seems to have been relatively free of epidemics of major scope during the mission years, and there is no trace in the documents of any major epidemic affecting the gentile population. In those instances reported of expeditions to the mountains and desert to capture run-away neophytes from the missions, encounters with the Cahuilla were amicable, and on one occasion they aided in the capture.
In the absence of any adverse information in documents of the Spanish and Mexican periods and considering the short period of contact the Cahuilla are known to have had with the mission, it appears that the Cahuilla population did not seriously diminish between 1775 and 1850. Improvement of subsistence techniques through the introduction of agriculture may well have served to negate any losses from mission contact or disease. The Cahuilla population of the 1850's was probably at much the same level as it had been in aboriginal times.
Abundant documentation on the Cahuilla does not begin until the period of American sovereignty in California. Until this time, most of their area was relatively isolated and beyond the perimeter of Spanish-Mexico activity. For the Americans, however, the Cahuilla were a potential military threat since they were the largest surviving Indian group in southern California west of the Colorado River. Such groups as the Gabrielino, Fernandeno, Juaneno, and Serrano were by then approaching extinction, while the Luiseiio and Diegueno had declined considerably since pre-mission days. Census information was important to both military and civilian authorities and ranges from village head counts to estimates of the total Cahuilla population. The census

estimates of specific localities provide a check on the reliability of the general estimates.
In 1852, Benjamin Wilson was commissioned to prepare a report on the Indians of southern California. Wilson was selected because of his experience and reputation; he was a long-time and widely traveled resident of southern California and was recognized as the most knowledgeable man on Indian matters in that area. In preparing his report, he was assisted by Judge Benjamin Hayes and also probably by Cave J. Couts. While neither of the latter had been in California many years, both were well traveled in the region and also seem to have had a special interest in Indians. Wilson submitted his report in 1852 and stated that the entire number of Cahuilla "scarcely exceeds 3000 souls" (Caughey, 1952).
In 1856, Indian Agent John Rains also estimated that the Cahuilla numbered about 3000 (Rains, 1856). Rains, however, might have used Wilson's estimate. Although the report had not yet been published, he could well have had access to it through the Bureau of Indian Affairs.3 Special Indian Agent Kendrick, on the other hand, appears to have personally inquired into the matter. In 1857, he reported to the Superintendent of Indian Affairs (Kendrick, 1857):
There are many different estimates of the number of this tribe. Juan Antonio says he can bring two thousand five hundred warriors into the field, but from the most reliable information I can get, I think they number three thousand five hundred men, women, and children.
The general estimates, therefore, are
3 Wilson's report was not published until 1868, when it appeared in a series of ten installments in the Los Angeles Star. It was widely known, however, and in 1853 the Star published a comment on it.

fairly consistent. The Cahuilla, if not 3000, were at least numerous enough to give qualified observers that impression.
Southern California was surveyed in the early 1850's, and the field notes of surveyors 4 are an invaluable corpus of first-hand observations. According to the surveyor's reports, there were 22 Cahuilla settlements in 1854 (Table 1). Traditionally, each Cahuilla community consisted of a single clan or lineage. However, by the early 1850's several of them contained not only more than one lineage but also more than one clan. According to Strong (1929) there were about 50 named, localized lineages, or branch clans as he called them, among the Cahuilla in the 1850's, each of which consisted "usually of fifty or more per-

sons." By this reckoning, we again arrive at a total population of approximately 2500 to 3000 persons. However, we can also examine this figure in terms of the census reports for individual settlements. While such reports are not available for all Cahuilla communities in the 1850's, they do exist for the more populous ones.
In late 1843 or early 1844, many of the Mountain Cahuilla clans moved into the San Bernardino Valley and settled near a site known as Politana. They had been invited to settle on the San Bernardino Ranch by its owner, Jose del Carmen Lugo, to protect his cattle from marauding bands of Paiutes. This group consisted of five or possibly six clans, which had recently united politically under the famous Cahuilla chief, Juan Antonio. The Politana settlement is reported to have contained more than 40 warriors (Beattie, 1939). In fact, at the battle of Aguanga in

190

1851, Juan Antonio had 50 warriors,5 which would indicate the settlement must have contained 250 to 300 persons. In the same year, 1851, Juan Antonio and his band relocated in the San Timoteo canyon at a site known as Sahapta. There they remained until his death in 1863.
Los Coyotes, in Coyote canyon, was another populous cluster of Mountain Cahuilla communities. During the Garra Revolt in 1851, Captain Heintzelman led a small military force against the Cahuilla in the canyon and encountered 30 to 40 warriors (Heintzelman, 1851). This figure suggests a population of 150 to 250 people for these communities. At that time, the wiwaiistam clan which occupied the canyon was composed of five localized lineages, indicating an average of from 30 to 50 persons per lineage. The population of one of these lineages (or rancherias) was reported by Deputy Surveyor R. C. Matthewson in 1855 to have contained 60 persons (C.F.N.S., vol. 34). This suggests that the larger estimate of 250 for the several settlements in the canyon is the more reliable figure.
As for the villages on the desert, Agent Wentworth in 1862 reported that Agua Caliente, or Palm Springs, contained "about 200 souls in all," that Toros was "about 250 in number," and that Martinez was "the largest of these settlements in point of population." The estimate for Palm Springs seems reliable; it is the one location observed in that general area in 1855 that impressed the surveyor James G. McDonald as containing "a large number of Indians" (C.F.N.S., Vol. 34). Many travelers also commented on the size of Toros (e.g., McClave, 1862). We

know that by 1862 the two settlements at Martineze numbered close to 300 persons and contained seven clans or lineages. Prior to that time, only three clans resided in the Martinez locality. The other clans were drawn to Martinez at the outbreak of the Civil War when a wagon route between Fort Yuma and Los Angeles, by way of San Gorgonio Pass, was established. Martinez was directly on the route, and the prosperity born of trade with travelers had attracted four more clans to the location. In the 1850's, the population of Martinez was probably on the order of 150 to 200 people.
Thus, the reports indicate that the largest five Cahuilla villages in the 1850's contained a total of 1000 to 1200 people (Table 2), or an average of 200 to 240 per village. Since these five villages also contained 17 clans or branch lineages, the average size of the lineages was 60 to 70 people.
While these were the most prominent Cahuilla settlements in the 1850's, some other communities were also fairly large. In 1856, Captain H. S. Burton reported that of the Cahuilla settlements, "the village of Cabazon is much the largest and most important" (Burton, 1856). However, he seems to have meant the several rancherias clustered

close together which belonged to Cabazon's clan. In any event, Cabazon's own village, the villages of Potrero and Malki in San Gorgonio Pass and Indian Wells and Agua Dulce on the desert were all sizeable. There are enough reports to indicate that these communities averaged 100 persons minimally, or approximately 40 to 50 persons per clan or branch lineage, giving a total of 500 for the five.
The remaining 11 communities appear to have been small, such as the one in Palm Canyon. Surveyor McDonald noted in 1856 that this community consisted of "some 8 or 10 huts" and at the time, "about 30 Indians--mostly old men, women, and children" (C.F. N.S., Vol. 34). The rest of its members when McDonald observed it were probably at the clan's gathering tract. In total, it perhaps numbered 40 to 50 people. On the whole, an estimate of 50 persons per clan or branch lineage seems to be a reasonable average for the 11 small settlements, which yields a total of 550 for the group.
The number of Cahuilla residing more or less permanently outside their old aboriginal habitat in the 1850's is more difficult to determine. In 1856, Captain Ord made the observation that "each of the large cattle Ranchos near Los Angeles and San Bernardino has from fifteen to thirty Indians permanently occupied on it, they are numerously employed by the Mormons at San Bernardino . . ." (Ord, 1856). Such a group was described by Lt. Whipple in 1854: "Our camp is near a rancheria of Cahuillas, who appears to be peons of Cocamonga . . . a filthy and miserablelooking set, and great beggars . . ." (Whipple, 1856). Another settlement was on the Rancho San Jacinto at this time, and still another on the Rancho San Jacinto Nuevo y Potrero. When

Juan Antonio's group moved into the San Bernardino Valley, there was already a sizeable colony of Indians, some of whom were unquestionably Cahuilla. Thus, in the 1850's there appear to have been about 200 Cahuilla permanently residing outside of their traditional territory.
The foregoing discussion indicates that the total population of the Cahuilla in the 1850's was, in round figures, 2500 people, distributed as follows:

Large settlements:
Medium-size settlements:
Small settlements:
Residing outside of territory:

1000-1200
500 550
200

2250-2500
While this estimate is more conservative than that made by observers at the time, the two are in surprisingly close agreement and are mutually reinforcing. Moreover, this tends to confirm Strong's estimate of 50 to 60 per lineage. The Cahuilla population in the 1850's, therefore, can be said to have been between 2500 and 3000 people.
After the 1850's, it began to decline. Special Indian Agent Augustus P. Greene (1869) gave the total Cahuilla population as 1800 persons in 1869. In 1873, however, Special Agent John G. Ames reported that the Desert Cahuilla numbered "one thousand and eighty, distributed in about twelve rancherias." The Mountain Cahuilla totaled "eight hundred and fifty seven" (Ames, 1873). Thus, the 1873 total of 1937 persons represents a 15.8% decline from the estimated minimum of approximately 2300 living in the traditional area in the 1850's. While it is certainly a substantial reduction, it is somewhat misleading, insofar as it re-

fleets only the population that remained within the area and does not allow for the outward flow of those who were attracted elsewhere. One branch lineage of the wiwaiistam clan of Coyote canyon, for example, joined the Cupeno at Kupa during this period.
Some Cahuilla died during the smallpox epidemic of 1863, but the extent of this epidemic has been greatly exaggerated. One of the smallpox victims during this epidemic was Judge Benjamin Hayes (M.D.) who recorded in his diary:
The extent to which the small pox prevailed amongst the Southern Indians in the period from October 1862 to March 1863, has been over-stated. It was worse at San Juan Capistrano than anywhere else: there of 141 victims, full 130 were Indians. In San Bernardino, it was confined to the family of Mr. John Brown, and myself, amongst the whites; three Indians in the City of San Bernardino, and a few (including Juan Antonio) at San Timoteo, and at Saboba, on the rancho of old San Jacinto five Indians died.
It is doubtful that the epidemic spread to the desert, but since it is mentioned by Strong's Los Coyotes informants as the cause of their abandonment of the canyon at that time, it can be assumed that the Mountain Cahuilla had some losses (Strong, 1929). Their losses from smallpox, however, could not have been nearly so extensive as Strong implied, since 140 Coyote Indians were reported in a census of 1865 (Lovett, 1865), and one lineage, as mentioned, is known to have moved to Kupa. Moreover, Judge Hayes (n.d.) goes on to say:
Since regulations which, at my instance, the Justice of the Peace of San Diego adopted for the Indians of that township; I sent to Manuelito Cota, with a recommendation that he should enforce them among all the

mountain rancherias. This was on January 16, 1863. He did so and maintained a perfect quarantine for the Indian population until May following by which time the disease had completely disappeared in Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties. This policy saved them from contagion. Not a single case occurred of sickness from smallpox after January amongst any of the Indians south of Temecula, numbering probably three thousand souls from the coast to the Colorado desert.
During the next two decades, 1873 to 1895, the Cahuilla population does appear to have declined considerably. While it is difficult to obtain a comprehensive index of their population for a given year, a fairly reliable composite can be constructed. The data for these decades are presented in Table 3; the italicized values are the most reliable for each locality. For example, Smiley's total of 250 for the Cahuilla reservation specifically includes those Indians temporarily not present when the census was taken (Smiley Comm., 1891). For Saboba, the lower value is taken, since Luiseiios are known to have moved in at some time during these years, and hence can account for the increase. Even allowing for the influx of Luisenos, the total of 157 persons in 1883 would still not have been purely Cahuilla, since a few Serranos are known to have survived in that population until the end of the nineteenth century. Their number, however, was very small. The italicized values in Table 3, therefore, are not arbitrarily selected.
The total Cahuilla population within their traditional territory circa 1890 was 1239 persons. Approximately 300 resided outside the area in the cities of Riverside and San Bernardino. Between 1873 and 1890, therefore, the Cahuilla population living in the traditional area

decreased 36% in constrast to an estimated 16% reduction between 1850and 1873. The reduction for the entire period, 1850's to 1890, within the traditional area amounts to 46%. These data are summarized in Table 4.
Within the Cahuilla population as a whole, the regional branches declined at quite different rates. The Mountain Cahuilla population essentially had no loss; the Desert branch declined 52%; and the Pass branch declined 74% (Table 5 and Fig. 2).
What these figures suggest is that

those communities closest to the budding metropolitan centers of Riverside and San Bernardino suffered the greatest losses. In the 1850's, the Mountain Cahuilla clans were concentrated largely in a single village (Sahapta) in San Timoteo canyon under the leadership of Juan Antonio. As Judge Hayes (n.d.) noted, Juan Antonio died in the smallpox epidemic of 1863. These clans then returned to their old habitat in the Santa Rosa mountains and were subsequently geographically isolated.
While there is no simple explanation or single causal factor behind the decrease in Cahuilla population which occurred after the American occupation of California, one important underlying factor was improved communications. The 1870's were a great time for road construction and railroad building in southern California. The war was over, and that neglected corner of the state was anxious to open its lines of com-

munication to the east. The Cahuilla contributed to the labor force on these projects. When the railroad was completed, they became some its most dependable customers. While the desert attracted few whites until the present century, the bustling life on the coast side of the mountains held many attractions for the Cahuilla, and there are countless tales of their activity during this era. The breakdown of geographic isolation provided one of the conditions for Cahuilla population decline; and the increased number of Cahuilla reported in the urban areas of Riverside and San Bernardino by 1890 suggests that they were not dying out so much as moving out of their traditional area.
Referring specifically to the Mountain Cahuilla, Special Agent J. Q. A. Stanley reported in 1869 that "many of the young men and women visit the towns and settlements, and obtain em-

ployment as house servants, or work on ranches or in the vineyards" (Stanley, 1869). Reporting in 1877 on the status of the Mission Indians, Agent Colburn (1877) stated that they could "be divided with respect to their condition and manner of living into three classes:"
The first division may be defined as those who stay on or about the ranches or farms of white men, living by daily labor upon the farms. . . . Most of the larger ranchmen have about them one or several families. . . . These Indians do most of the ordinary work of the ranches, except when harvest-time, sheep-shearing, or some special season requires the employment of other help. . . .
The second class is made up of those who live in small communities, cultivating lands they have held for a long time and have been accustomed to call their own. . . . Each Indian family at these villages has a house and cultivates a patch of ground. . . . The Indian men plant their fields in the spring, give them a more or less thrifty cultivation till a season comes when they can get temporary employment on ranches, and then they leave their homes in charge of the squaws and old men, and go out to labor. . . .
The third class is rather small, and includes those that hang upon the outskirts of towns, pass wistfully through the streets, seldom asking for anything, but silently begging with their longing, pathetic eyes. At times, when they can get whisky, the men are besotted brutes, and the women are generally prostitutes, though the family tie is still strong enough to keep squaw and papoose with the husband. With this class are some unmarried women who are prostitutes. . . .
The accounts indicate over and over again that the Emigres were adults of reproductive age, the age group most likely to have been in demand and to have been attracted by wage work. The old and the very young stayed behind.

While both sexes were involved in the emigration, the implications were quite different for men and women and in turn for Cahuilla society itself. For the men, wage work could be a compromise; they could work a while, return home to the village, then leave again. The single woman, however, working as a household domestic or prostitute was more apt to have been employed on a year-round basis and hence, more liable to have been permanently removed from participation in the traditional society. These occupations were more apt to have resulted in the permanent loss to the community of women of reproductive age. And, of course, as whole families found it easier to subsist on the fringes of white civilization than in their native environment, the offspring were removed from the traditional marriage pool. Given the marriage structure that prevailed, these factors were vitally important in causing the breakdown of Cahuilla society.
Considering the distribution of Cahuilla settlements, the small size of the local groups, and the marriage rules, scarcity in mate possibilities was a factor even in aboriginal times. A Cahuilla could marry only someone of the opposite moiety who was not considered a close relative of his mother. These rules resulted in a system-imposed scarcity of eligible mates, which is reflected in the widespread practice of infant betrothal and a relatively elaborate social machinery for assuring marriage, which included a sizeable bride price.
There were some minor cultural and linguistic differences among the regional branches of the Cahuilla in aboriginal times, but social organization seems to have been fairly uniform; and although each branch was largely endogamous in the statistical sense, they were interdependent to a certain extent in that

marriage was possible and occasionally took place between them. Each branch thus functioned as a safety valve for the other in supplying spouse material. Limited as it may have been between the branches, the exchange was nontheless vital for the maintenance of the marriage system.
Bethrothal generally occurred at an early age, but marriage did not occur until after puberty. A preferred marriage seems to have been with a member of the mother's clan who was not considered to be a close relative. Among the Pass Cahuilla, and probably the others, as well, the mother served as a go-between between the two groups in selecting a mate for her son. What was important for the maintenance of the marriage system, however, was that infant bethrothal was not inevitable, nor was marriage with a member of mother's clan imperative. The primary requirement was that the bride be a member of the opposite moiety.
Given the marriage rules of Cahuilla society and the preferences (propinquitous groups), in aboriginal times mate choices were extremely (limited even under optimum conditions. At best, the number of mate possibilities probably ranged between 8 and 15. They would vary according to local conditions, such as the size and distribution of the local groups that constituted the marriage circuit, and from generation to generation.
In aboriginal times there was probably also an absolute scarcity of women of reproductive age. A census taken in 1854 of 18 Diegueno settlements indicates that reproductive-age males outnumbered reproductive-age females by 9% (Burton, 1854). A census taken the following year of both Luiseno and Diegueno communities indicates the same ratio (Couts, 1855). While some of

the differential might be attributed to direct loss of women to sqaw-men and to other factors that attracted Indian women from their communities,7 the differential is sufficiently high to suggest a relatively high maternal mortality. If this was the case among the neighboring Luiseno and Diegueno, it was doubtlessly similar for the Cahuilla. Thus, the system-imposed scarcity of marriageable women affected the local group, while the absolute scarcity affected the society as a whole.
The age structure of the neighboring Diegueno population in 1854, according to Captain Burton's report, was as follows: 33% pre-reproductive; 52% reproductive; and 15% postreproductive (Burton, 1854). While this does not indicate what the age structure of the Cahuilla was in 1854, it provides some idea and can be used as a rough index for present purposes. Thus, according to this index, a Cahuilla settlement of 65 people would have contained some 21 prereproductive, 34 reproductive, and 10 postreproductive age persons. Assuming a more or less equal division among the sexes, for each male, there would have been approximately 10 possible mate choices. Hence, the loss of one woman approaching or of reproductive age could reduce the local mate choice situation by as much as 10%. The decline in Chauilla population, therefore, need not have been the result of a mass exodus of people, but simply a small but steady drain of young women.
Because of geographical proximity to San Bernardino and Riverside, the Pass Cahuilla were the first to come into ex-
7 In speaking of the Diegueño rancheria of San Pasqual, for example, Special Indian Agent Greene (1869) commented, "I found the practice of selling young girls to white men prevailed to an alarming extent at this tancheria, so much so that it is almost impossible for an Indian to get a wife, unless he takes one at second hand."

tensive contact with whites. The Pass Cahuilla population also suffered the greatest decline. Moreover, they were the first group, according to Strong, (1929) to abandon the moiety regulation. Abandonment of the moiety regulation not only increased the number of possible mate choices, but also brought Cahuilla marriage regulations more in line with the practices of an "Indian society" that was emerging, and with American society. Eventually, the moiety regulation was also abandoned among the Desert and Mountain branches. What is interesting is not that it was abandoned, but that it lasted as long as it did. For a time before it was finally abandoned, individuals went farther and farther afield for mates, rather than change the social rules.
In aboriginal times, because of linguistic and cultural barriers, it is doubtful if there were many interethnic marriages in southern California (Fig. 3). Each ethnic group, each society such as the Luiseno, Diegueno, and Serrano, was endogamous. For the Cahuilla, as for other groups, there was little choice but to stay within the boundaries of the society, geographically and socially. When other societies such as the Serrano and Luiseno began to disintegrate, the individual Cahuilla was provided with alternatives: he could leave--settle elsewhere--or marry a non-Cahuilla or both. Over the past century, for example, the Pass Cahuilla and Serrano have extensively intermarried. Cahuilla society gradually but continuously diminished in number as communications improved ofter the 1850's, but an "Indian society" was coming into being that consisted of the remnants of onceautonomous groups. Many of the Cahuilla, individually or in family units, joined this new group and lost their identity as Cahuilla.

Part of the aboriginal environment of the Cahuilla was their neighbors-- the Serrano, Luiseno, and Diegueno. Culturally, they were quite dissimilar. Each had worked out its own system for the management and survival of its population. Basic to this for all groups was the territorial principle. Each lineage and clan had its own prescribed territory, which bounded those of other lineages and clans. Along the peripheries, those of the Luiseno bounded the Diegueno, Cahuilla bounded Serrano, and so forth. The activities of daily life took place within the boundaries of these small territories, which formed an endless chain interlinking southern California and connecting it with the north, south, and east. These small territories were home. There was nowhere else to go. European occupation disturbed this territorial basis of aboriginal society. It created alternatives for life where none had existed. As it happened, population declined.

Native societies had to regroup, reformulate. Where number was important, new rules were invoked. For example, kinship no longer formed the basis of ceremonial organization; the "party," its membership disparate, took over the activity. Those groups subjected most directly to European influences broke down sooner. The Cahuilla lasted longer because they were more remote, but the breakdown was inevitable. Their neighbors had changed. The social environment of which they had been a part no longer existed.
The significance of Cahuilla population decline is that it was not cataclysmic nor were its causes obvious. Neither warfare nor epidemics were factors. Rather, being provided with the alternative of assimilation, a situation that became possible after white contact, traditional Cahuilla society gradually lost its members and was unable to replace them. What happened to the Cahuilla was not unique, only the
