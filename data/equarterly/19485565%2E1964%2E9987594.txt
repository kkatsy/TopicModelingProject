The purpose of this paper is to present data centering on the 1960 Census for first admissions to the state mental hospital system of Ohio during the three and one-half years, July 1958 to December 1961, of current patient profiles and admission patterns as they pertain to migration. Another aspect of the analysis compares the current findings with 1950 patient profiles and patterns of admission for consistency or change (Lazarus, 1963; Thomas, 1963; Lee, 1963; Locke, 1960c).
This report deals with two types of migrants: (1) foreign-born, (2) nativeborn. The foreign-born migrants will be discussed first.
According to the 1960 Census, 4.1% of Ohio's population were foreign-born as contrasted with 5.4% for the United States. The foreign-born white population in Ohio numbered slightly less than 391,000. During the study period there were 1,507 foreign-born white admissions to the Ohio public mental hospitals. In the same interval, 23,298 native-born whites were admitted.
Fig. 1 and 2 show the average annual first admission rates to Ohio State public mental hospitals for white males and white females by age, nativity and residence. Table 1 presents the age-adjusted average annual first admission rates among white persons. The several previous reports on this subject have established the need to correct the crude rates because of the importance of age on admission rates and the much older age of

the foreign-born population. In Ohio, for example, the median age of the foreign-born and native-born whites was 59.5 and 28.4 years, respectively.
These age-adjusted rates for all diagnoses in Table 1 show that the nativeborn have higher rates of admission than do the foreign-born for males from metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas and for females from the nonmetropolitan area. Rates for females from the metropolitan area are about the same for native as for foreign-born. These findings represent an alteration in patterns of admission from the 1950 report for Ohio which found that even after "rates were

adjusted for age, the rates remained higher for the foreign-born" (Locke, 1960c).
As shown in Table 1, the higher admission rates for the native-born held for such diagnostic categories as alcoholism, psychoneurotic disorders, and personality disorders. However, the rate among the foreign-born was higher than for the native-born for those admitted with schizophrenia and mental diseases of the senium. The higher rate among foreignborn admitted with schizophrenia is consistent with the tristate study results of 1950 (Lazarus, 1963). There was no meaningful pattern of admissions among the remaining diagnostic categories.
Forty per cent of the foreign-born males admitted to Ohio public mental hospitals were from three countries: Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Poland. For foreign-born females, 38% of the admissions were from Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Poland. For both males and females the highest rates occurred for admissions from Austria-Hungary and Poland from among those countries with at least 35 admissions during the study period.

The foreign-born immigrant represents one group of migrants. Let us now turn our attention to the native-born.
Several surveys conducted by the Bureau of the Census indicate that approximately one-fifth of the American population changes its dwelling place each year. This finding is further testimony to an impression gained by many observers that our population probably is the most mobile of any nation in the world and that the rate of mobility today is higher than during any previous period of American History. Despite the obvious importance of migration to contemporary society, social scientists too often assume that Americans no longer face problems of assimilation. Indeed, we tend to believe that the concept of assimilation is relevant only to the experience of foreign-born persons entering this country. (Urban Studies Center, 1962).
For whatever the reasons, Table 2 and Figs. 3 and 4 show that rates of admission to the public mental hospitals of Ohio are higher for those native-born who have migrated to Ohio than those residents of Ohio who were born there. These findings agree with the results of the 1950 studies (Lazarus, 1963; Locke,

1960c). As shown in Table 2, this pattern also applies to such specific diagnoses as mental diseases of the senium, schizophrenia, and a conglomeration of "other" diagnoses. For those grouped in the diagnostic category "alcohol," the native migrant rate was also higher than the in-state born group except that among nonwhite males the rates were about the same. Among those admitted with the diagnosis "psychoneurosis" or "personality disorder," the white native migrant group had a higher rate than the white in-state born group, but the reverse was true for the nonwhite population. It is interesting to note that the

1960 data of Ohio for those admitted with schizophrenia is in much more agreement with the 1950 data of New York than with the 1950 data of Ohio (Lazarus, 1963).
Despite the findings of generally lower admission rates among the foreign-born migrant as shown in Table 1, Figs. 1and 2, and the negligible disparity between rates of the nonwhite males, there emerges an overall pattern of higher rates for migrants diagnosed as schizophrenia and mental diseases of the senium, the two ranking diagnoses among the nation's public mental hospital admissions.

For white males and females from the metropolitan areas, findings arein general accord with the hypothesis that migration and hospitalization for mental disorders are correlated. This pattern did not hold, however, forthe nonmetropolitan area. Indeed, an almost reverse

The data on economic characteristics suggest that the economically disadvantaged have the higher mobility rates . . . and, for men in this same age group, mobility rates are higher for men with incomes of less than $5,000 than for those with incomesof $5,000 or more. Whether low economic status generates mobility or whether high mobility has an adverse

effect in the short run on economic status still is an open question. (U.S. Dept. Commerce, 1962).
Studies have shown a correlation between admission rates to these Ohio public mental hospitals and education and occupation (Locke, 1958, 1960a, 1960b). The admission rates are generally higher for those with few yearsof school completed or who occupy lower level occupational positions, factors usually associated with low income. It may well bethat the diversity of the 72 counties is such that the available data does not depict therelationship between mobility and mental illness as clearly as do the few large metropolitan areas.
Among nonwhites, both sexes, the admission rates from the metropolitan Areas I and II were about identical. Many of the factors presented above with regard tothe nonmetropolitan findings may be equally pertinent inexplaining these nearly equal admission rates from areas with unequal migration rates.
SUMMARY
Migration and mental illness appear to be associated under certain conditions. Inasmuch as "about 35.5 million, or 20.0%, of the 177.4 million personsone year old and over who were living in the United States in March 1961 had moved at least once since March 1960" (U. S. Dept. Commerce, 1962), those factors in migration that affect mental health must be ascertained.
This study analyzed two types of migration. One type involved the immigrant--the foreign-born who migrated to the United States. Based on three and one-half years of admission data to the Ohio public mental hospital system the foreign-born have lower admission rates than the native-born. This finding is at variance with earlier studies whose re-

sults generally revealed higher rates for the foreign-born. The importance of periodically bringing facts up to date is highlighted by these 1960data which depart from findings based on 1950 or earlier material.
The second type ofmigration involved the native-born moving from their state of birth to another state (Ohio) ascompared to residents of that state who had been born there. These findings for 1960 were in concordance with findings for 1950 from three states; namely, that the native-born migrant has a significantly higher admission rate than the resident of the state of birth.
Another approach in analyzing the association of admission rates to public mental hospitals with mobility divided the State into five areas. Two areas represented metropolitan counties with high and low measurements of mobility. The findings agreed with thehypothesis that higher admission rates are associated with migration. The nonmetropolitan counties were divided into three groups based on measurements ofmobility. This analysis presented a reverse pattern; namely, thearea with theleast mobility had the highest admission rate tothe public mental hospitals. Several explanations for this finding were presented.
