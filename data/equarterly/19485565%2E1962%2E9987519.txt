The relative reproductive fitness of affected individuals, compared with the average reproductive fitness in the general population, is nearly zero. Therefore, indirect estimation of the rate of mutation (101) indicates that the mutation frequency from the normal alíele to the recessive phenylketonuria gene is nearly equal to the incidence of affected individuals in the population--i.e., between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 40,000.

affected (27), and the most striking clinical manifestation is mental deficiency. The urine of affected individuals reacts positively to tests for phenylpyruvic acid (C6H5.CH2.CO.COOH), the excretion of which is usually continuous throughout life, but occasional cases have been recorded in which only intermittent excretion was manifest (90).

only a few can communicate verbally, and there is no personality or behavior pattern which can be said to characterize the group (37). A few high-grade atypical cases (estimated to represent less than 1% of all phenylketonurics) have been described which, while apparently characterized by the continuous urinary excretion of phenylpyruvic acid, manifest near normal intelligence (24, 30, 39, 46, 50, 74, 100, 103).
The familial distribution of phenylketonuria is typical of that manifested by a classical Mendelian recessive autosomal trait. Statistical calculations have demonstrated good agreement between the segregation ratios and theoretical expectations. The incidence of first-cousin marriages among the parents of diagnosed phenylketonurics has been found to vary between 5% and 14%, invariably considerably higher than the frequencies in the general populations from which the cases were drawn (39).
BIOCHEMISTRY
The investigations of Jervis (62) and Armstrong et al. (6) have determined the basic biochemical peculiarity in the disease. Affected infants manifest from birth a deficiency in the "phenylalanine hydroxylase" enzyme system which converts phenylalanine to tyrosine (49, 61). Mitoma (78) has demonstrated that the enzyme system involves two protein fractions, both of which are normally found in the liver. Fraction I, a labile fraction, is present only in the liver; fraction II, a relatively stable fraction, is also found in kidney and heart tissues (79). The enzyme system requires diphosphopyridine nudeotide, which may occur in abnormally low concentrations in phenylketonurics (78), and ferrous ion; and the overall reaction apparently occurs in one step with no intermediates. Studies on

phenylketonurics have shown that fraction II is present in the tissues in normal amounts, and that the metabolic fault is based on a deficiency of fraction I (47, 67, 79, 109).
A majority of phenylketonurics are'] characterized by very light pigmentation: f very light skin, light blue eyes, light/ blond hair (35, 51, 57, 72, 89). Although! they tend to be lighter in pigmentation than the populations from which they are drawn (31, 39), no correlation has been found in affected individuals between pigmentation level and degree of mental defect (25). The depressed production of melanin may result from the metabolic block in the pathway of phenylalanine to tyrosine, the primary substrate for melanin formation. Directly ingested dietary tyrosine may serve as substrate for melanin formation, however, and normal pigmentation may therefore occur in phenylketonurics. Apparently, the pigmentary defect is at least partly based on competitive inhibition, the excess phenylalanine competing with tyrosine for the enzyme tyrosinase which is necessary for the formation of "dopa" (33) which may then be converted to melanin.
Affected individuals are unable to metabolize phenylalanine properly. Most food proteins contain approximately 4% to 6% phenylalanine (7). Since this "essential amino acid" (40, 111) is present in all natural protein foods, ingested phenylalanine soon accumulates in the blood, and phenylketone bodies (phenylpyruvic acid, phenyllactic acid, phenylacetylglutamines) are excreted in the urine. Phenylalanine accumulates in the blood in concentrations of 20 to 60 mg
j 100 cc, compared with normal levels of 1 to 2 mg per 100 cc. In the excretory process, phenylalanine is converted to its keto-acid analogue. The apparently re-

versible transamination (77) in the kidney leads to the characteristically large quantities of urinary phenylpyruvic acid. In addition, phenylketonurics excrete increased amounts of normal metabolites of phenylalanine in the urine (21). Their increased indican excretions, even though the net conversion of indole to indican is somewhat lower in phenylketonurics than in controls, suggest a general derangement of indole metabolism secondary to the occurrence of excess phenylalanine (15). The significantly lower levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the serum and of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the urine of phenylketonuric patients (9, 10, 55, 84) can be reversed by placing the patients on diets low in phenylalanine content (55). The disturbance of 5-hydroxyindole metabolism in phenylketonuria is due to an inhibition of 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase by the presence of excess phenylalanine metabolites (34, 55, 85, 98, 99) ). Thus, the disturbance of 5-hydroxyindole metabolism in phenylketonuria is secondary to the increase in phenylalanine.
The enzyme, 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase, does not occur in the kidney of the fetal or newborn rat, in which is manifest a gradual increase until the adult level is reached at about 33 days of age (56). If an analogous pattern of enzyme development occurs in the human, the development of this immature enzyme system might be inhibited by the presence of excess phenylalanine in early infancy.
As the condtion progresses, brain development jsjarrested and severe mental_ defxçjgncy_results, often recognizable by uie age of four months. Experimental diets marked by excess L-phenylalanine have produced analagous manifestations in rats and monkeys--i.e., high plasma

phenylalanine and phenylketonuria (8, 55, 107, 108). Monkeys subjected to such a _diet_from birth manifest profound mental retardation, and older (i.e. adolescent) monkeys exhibited retardation injgarnjng ability -(108). Evidently, abnormal metabolite accumulations and/or deficiencies (resulting primarily or secondarily from the enzyme deficiency and consequent metabolic block) interfere with normal development of the central nervous system (15, 70). The main reported neuropathological findings are micrencephaly and fibrous gliosis of the white matter (32).
The etiology of the mental defect in phenylketonuria is still unknown. The above observations, however, are compatible with the hypothesis that the arrested brain development may be the result of a decrease in 5-hydroxytrypJ^ amine (due to the secondary disturbánce in 5-hydroxyindole metabolism), which is essential to the developing, brain (55). There is no correlation between the concentrations of phenylalanine or its metabolites and degree of mental deficiency (20, 59, 60).
DETECTION OF PHENYLKETONURICS AND
DIETARY PROPHYLAXIS
The disease can be detected in early life, even before the onset of mental retardation, with relatively simple tests (2, 38, 97, 100, 114). Routine screening may be accomplished by qualitative determit nation of phenylpyruvic acid with ferric chloride (104) or with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (92). In the former method, a few drops of 5% or 10% ferric chloride solution is added to urine together with a few drops of IN hydrochloric acid (for acidification to a pH of about 2.5), and a positive test is indicated by the immediate appearance of a blue-g^eejuor gray-green color which begins to fade

within a minute (25, 100). False positives occur, however--e.g., in the presence of diacetic acid, salicylate, bilirubin, and possibly other substances. Also, from 5% to 10% of tests on known phenylketonurics are false negatives (26, 27). The 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine method depends on the production of a yellow turbidity when added, in 2N hydrochloric acid, to a positive urine specimen . Commercially-prepared paper strips are available, which are more sensitive than the above solutions--e.g., Phenistix by the Ames Company, Inc., and RT974 by the Lilly Research Laboratories.
The importance of efficient programs for identification of older phenylketonurics is demonstrated by the fact that most of the infants who have been diagnosed and treated in the first few weeks or months of life have had attention directed to their disorder through identification of an older affected sibling (5,19, 22, 41, 42, 43, 112, 113). By saving the state the future cost of institutionalizing low-grade mental defectives whose damage could be minimized by early detection and treatment of the inborn error of metabolism, such programs would save the state many times their cost (29).
The serum phenylalanine of affected children may rise within a day or two after birth (27), but detectable quantities of phenylpyruvic acid may not be excreted in the urine for as long as the first six weeks after birth (3, 4, 27, 41). Therefore, mass screening may most efficiently be carried out on babies six weeks of age and older--e.g., on the occasion of the first well-baby check-up (100).
More reliable tests for confirming phenylketonuria diagnoses, and also for evaluating the effectiveness of low phenylalanine diets, are based on quantita-

tive determinations of serum phenylalanine. The method of Udenfriend and Cooper (105) involves the utilization of Streptococcus faecalis for biological decarboxylation of the L-phenylalanine in deproteinized plasma to phenylethylamine, quantitative determination of which is made colorimetrically with methyl orange. This method requires relatively large amounts of plasma and the expenditure of many hours for each set of analyses. The above technique may be replaced by a modified phenylalanine decarboxylase method (51) in which commercially obtained decarboxylase (Tyrosine Decarboxylase from Nutritional Biochemicals Company) is utilized. Quantitative determination of serum phenylalanine by paper chromatography (11) involves the simplest technique but provides only crude quantitative estimates (65, 71). These, combined with the chromatographically demonstrated (qualitative) presence of O-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (11,12), have successfully been utilized as tests for confirmatory diagnoses of phenylketonuria. La Du's specific method of enzymatic spectrophotometry (71) provides for the rapid and precise analysis of plasma Lphenylalanine in as little as 0.1 ml of serum without prior deproteinization. The technique utilizes the L-amino acid oxidase of snake venom (from Crotalus adamanteus) for enzymatic conversion of plasma phenylalanine to the enolborate complex of phenylpyruvic acid, which is then measured spectrophotometrically.
If the metabolic defect is diagnosed at an early age--at least within the first six months of life--and proper dietary management provides adequate biochemical control, severe retardation can be prevented (3, 5, 7, 14, 16, 18, 19, 22, 23,41, 42, 43,44, 51, 66, 100, 112, 113). Affected

children whose treatment is initiated before the age of six months will probably fall into the borderline to normal range of intelligence (I.Q. 70 to 100), those whose treatment is begun between seven and eighteen months of age will probably achieve the status of educable mentally handicapped children (I.Q. 50 to 70), and those whose treatment is not begun until after the second birthday will probably be retarded beyond even the trainable (I.Q. 30) threshold (100). Similar treatment in older affected individuals has been of little or no value (68, 100). In some cases, dietary prophylaxis decreases from maximal effectiveness if not instituted during the first four to six weeks of life (7). At that age, milk is ordinarily the main food, and its phenylalanine content is approximately 50 mg per ounce (82). Dietary substitutes are mandatory for prophylactic treatments of phenylketonurics, and numerous appropriate recipes have been devised (1).
One commercial preparation (Ketonil by Merck, Sharpe and Dohme) consists of a casein hydrolysate amino acid powder, which is made by hydrolyzing the milk protein (casein) and removing most of the phenylalanine. The powder may be mixed with calculated amounts of oil, sugar, and water, depending on individual requirements. Another commercial preparation (Lofenalac by Mead Johnson & Co.) is a more complete formula, with fat, carbohydrate, and certain vitamins already added to the basic amino acid powder.
Due_to the facL-thatphenylalanineJs. an "essential_amjno_acid" (40, ljj^__its_ completeelimination from the diet is in¿ tolerable^,'The dietary requirements tend to vary inversely with age (1). Recommended minimum quantities for maintenance intake vary with the different investigators. Rose and coworkers

(95, 96) proposed a minimum daily intake of 1.1 mg L-phenylalanine for young adult males, and Snyderman et al. (102) reported that the daily requirements of normal infants range from 60 to 90 mg per kilogram body weight. Paine and Hsia (83) reported that the daily phenylalanine requirement of a sixmonth-old phenylketonuric was about 25 mg per kilogram body weight, and that for a fifteen-year-old phenylketonuric ranged from 5 to 15 mg per kilogram. Armstrong and coworkers (5) suggest a daily dietary intake of 25 mg phenylalanine per kilogram. Acosta and Centerwall (1) recommend the daily inclusion of 20 mg phenylalanine per kilogram "in the form of natural foods," in addition to the casein hydrolysate, to cover basic protein needs. The actual amount of phenylalanine required to maintain normal blood levels varies with each phenylketonuric patient and requires individual adjustment. After an initial depletion period of one to two weeks, during which the patient is given only the low-phenylalanine formula, more foods may be added to maintain the blood phenylalanine levels at 2 to 6 mg per 100 ml (1).
Phenylketonuric patients being many. tained on a special low-phenlalanine diet should be checked at least ^mce every several weeks., and the low plasma phenylalanine level maintained. A possible alternative method for gauging the efficiency of a low phenylalanine diet, which requires further investigation, may be by measurement of urinary indican (15). Phenylpyruvic acid excretion in the urine may not be used to measure the dietary effectiveness of biochemical control because detectable quantities do not occur in the urine when the plasma level falls below 10 mg per 100 ml (51).

HETEROZYGOTE DETERMINATION
The problem of correctly determining 'carriers' of the phenylketonuria factor has been largely but not entirely solved (110). The utilization of phenylalanine tolerance tests for hétérozygote detection was first described by Hsia et al. (48), and several methodological variations have been described which involve utilizing different techniques to measure the blood phenylalanine levels (13, 63, 73, 94). A load of 0.1 g of L-phenylalanine per kilogram body weight is administered orally after an overnight fast, and plasma phenylalanine levels are determined at one, two, and four hours after consumption of the test dose (49). The plasma levels of hétérozygotes generally tend to be about twice as high as those observed in normal controls (53); the plasma phenylalanine curve of the hétérozygote tends to be intermediate between the steep curve of the normal and the flat curve of the affected homozygote (63). Heterozygous 'carriers' have also been distinguished from normal individuals on the basis of fasting plasma phenylalanine levels without using a phenylalanine load (69). Phenylalanine-tyrosine ratios have been used with greater accuracy in identifying heterozygous 'carriers' (45). The urinary excretion of 5hydroxyindoleacetic acid is detectably lower in hétérozygotes than in normal controls (53). None of the above methods alone is sufficiently diagnostic to discriminate accurately between heterozygous 'carriers' and normal (homozygous) individuals (45, 52, 53, 110). The combined application of all the above tests in investigations of suspected 'carriers,' however, can facilitate a very high rate of accurate discrimination and identification of hétérozygotes.

ADDENDA
Commercially prepared paper strips have been used successfully in mass surveys to detect unknown phenylketonurics (119, 120). Guthrie and colleagues have recently developed an "inhibition assay" test for screening large populations of mental retardates more reliably (116, 117, 118). Small filter paper discs containing dried blood (or urine) are tested with Bacillus subtilis cultures in agar impregnated with beta-2-thienylalanine to inhibit bacterial growth. Phenylalanine is a specific antagonist of the beta-2-thienylalanine, and presence of the former facilitates a zone of bacterial growth (which is a positive test).
Recently, the Technical Committee on Clinical Programs for Mentally Retarded Children (of the Children's Bureau, Social Security Administration) has undertaken to coordinate and support phenylketonuria programs in the United States (121). The states of Michigan, Oregon, Wisconsin, California and Ohio now provide support for screening programs (115).
