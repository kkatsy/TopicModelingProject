A NOTE ON CHANGES IN AGE AT MARRIAGE OF FEMALES AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE BIRTH RATE IN INDIA
PREM P. TALWAR Dept. of Biostatistics University of North Carolina

First of all, I would like to clarify the apparent misunderstanding which is evident from my note, and many other such notes, attempting to show the relationship between age at marriage1 and the birth rate. One can think of studying the relationship between the female age at marriage and fertility in two ways:
1. Empirical observation from different studies where completed family size of different marriage-age cohorts is compared. This is what the authors of the paper under discussion (Basavarajappa and Belvalgidad, 1967) are doing in section 1.1. Here one should not overlook the fact that the marriage-age cohorts in such studies come from different socioeconomic statuses and thus their fertility differentials are not only the functions of their age at marriage but also of differentials in their socioeconomic statuses. For instance, it will be agreeable to all if I say that poor and illiterate people in India marry at a relatively younger age than the educated and the better-off people. Similarly, less educated and agricultural people of rural India have a marriage-age norm different from more educated and industrial people of urban areas. Hence the differences in the completed family size in these two groups cannot be attributed only to the differences in their age at marriage.
2. Observation by model studies. In
1 Age at marriage, here, implies female age at marriage.

this type of approach the age at marriage is raised hypothetically to a certain level, keeping the other parameters constant, and the effect on the level of birth rate is studied. We need such studies in order to assess the potentialities of a raise in age at marriage as a measure in population control programs. This sort of relationship is referred to by the authors in section 1.2. These types of studies assume some pattern of change in the agespecific birth rates (according to the assumption about the raise in age at marriage) and consider how they change the level of crude birth rate.
Basavarajappa and Belvalgidad (1967) refer to different attempts made in India, including ours (Zachariah and Talwar, 1964), and claim that "these analyses do not show how postponement of marriage which leads to changes in proportion married in various ages and in age composition, at least during the transition period, affect the birth rate." This is to bring to the notice of the authors that either of the two approaches stated below leads to the adjustment of the same factor:
(a) adjustment in the marital composition, or
(b) adjustment in the age-specific fertility rates. The increase in age at marriage would affect the proportion sterile and the proportion married; thus the age-specific fertility rates would change according

to the assumption about widowhood, sterility, or the pattern of marriage.
We have made an adjustment of the latter type rather than the former which the authors are referring to. Hence the factor of the marital composition has been taken care of in our paper in the transition period as well as in the long run (stabilized situation).
In section 1.3, the authors state their approach in determining the effect of raise in marriage age on the level of birth rate. The approach adopted by them seems to be very complex and involves many questionable assumptions, such as
(a) adjustment of the age composition for the 1961 census,
(b) assumption about the constant mortality for all marital status groups,
(c) the method of projecting the marital status distribution.
Of course, the test of the right recipe for pudding lies in its eating. The results obtained (in terms of reduction in the birth rate) are an evidence that the assumptions involved in obtaining the relationship between the age at marriage and birth rate have not achieved the desired accuracy and something has gone wrong somewhere. For instance, the authors come out with the result that the maximum reduction in the level of birth rate is on the order of 9.4 percent over that of 1961 when the age at marriage is raised from the 1961 level of 15.8 years to over 20 years. This increase in the age at marriage will definitely increase the length of generation and thus the level of crude birth rate will decline even if the couples manage to attain the same completed family size (total fertility). Not only the length of generation would increase but also the later beginning of marital life would reduce the completed

family size (Ridley and Sheps, 1965). Hence we expect both these factors operating in the analysis attempted by the authors. Coale and Tye (1961) through the Stable Population Analysis came out with the finding that "the increase of 2.7 years in the mean length of generation is associated with a reduction of 3.1 per thousand in the intrinsic rate of growth, which is equivalent to about 8 percent lower fertility without the change in age pattern." When the reduction in the completed family size is considered, the reduction in the crude birth rate will be all the more.
In other words, it seems to me that the smaller order of reduction in the level of birth rate obtained in the study of Basavarajappa and Belvalgidad is due to hazardous sets of assumptions made by the authors, especially in regard to projection of the marital status distribution. In my opinion, we (Zachariah and Tal war, 1964) adopted a less hazardous approach in assessing the relationship between age at marriage and the level of birth rate. A precise version of that attempt will be given here in order to clarify what I mean by "less hazardous approach."
Our approach can be outlined in the following steps:
1. The pattern of age-specific rates in India for 1961 was assumed to be the same as used by Coale and Hoover, 1958, which gives a total fertility of 5.41. When this fertility pattern is applied to the Indian age composition of 1961, we get a crude birth rate of 41.2 per thousand population which is quite close to the different estimates available for the actual level of birth rate in India.
2. It was assumed that the raise in age at marriage would change the pattern of age-specific fertility rates according to the assumptions on marital pattern,

widowhood pattern, and the sterility pattern. We did not consider marital fertility rates, as in that case we have to project age distribution by marital status, which is really a hazardous task. This changed pattern in specific fertility rates will take into account both the aspects of decline in fertility:
(a) increase in the length of generation
(b) reduction in the total fertility
3. It was thought more reasonable to have three sets of assumptions about the changed pattern of fertility rates when no woman was allowed to marry below the age of 20. These three sets of assumptions on fertility pattern are the ones which we think give the minimum, maximum, and the "most likely" reduction in the birth rate.
4. Age composition for the female population of India for 1961 onwards was obtained by projecting the 1961 census population on the assumption that the °e0 during 1961-1966 for females is 50 years and that it increases at the rate of 2.5 years in every 5 years. The Model Life Tables were used for the survival ratios in such projections (United Nations, 1956).
5. Once we obtained the age distribution and the pattern of age-specific fertility rates, the crude birth rates for different periods and for different sets of assumptions were calculated by the formula:
40
BFJ is the female population in the age group x to x + 5 in the year t, and sfj is age-specific fertility rates in the age group x to x + 5 in the year t.
It can be seen from the preceding that our analysis is based on the changes in-

troduced in the pattern of fertility rates by changes in the age at marriage only.

ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE SPECIFIC
FERTILITY RATES
Minimum reduction
Only patterns of specific fertility rates
change but the total fertility remains the
same:
(a) There is no change in the total fertility rate, which remains constant from 1961 to 1986 at the level of 5.41.
(b) The specific fertility rates at ages 15-19 will decrease from 92 to 0 during 1961-1966 and will continue to be 0 for the rest of the period.
(c) The specific fertility rates at the other ages are proportionately increased, so that the total fertility may be the same as in 1961. The actual rates are given in Table 1.

Maximum reduction
(a) The specific fertility rates at ages 15-19 will decrease from 92 to 0 during 1961-1966 and will continue to be 0 for the remaining period.
(b) Since women start marrying at age 20, it is reasonable to expect that not all would get married at the age of 20. So at ages 20-24 we ex-

pect a reduction in the specific fertility rates as a result of reduction in the number of women exposed to the risk of pregnancy for all the five years. But we do not think that the age-specific fertility rates in the age group 20-24 under the changed conditions will be less than that of 15-19 under the earlier situation. We, therefore, think that the maximum reduction we can expect in this age group is from 130to92. (c) There will not be any reduction in any other age groups. The specific fertility rates under these assumptions are given in Table 2.

Most likely change
(a) The specific fertility rates at ages 15-19 will decrease from 92 to 0 during 1961-1966 and will continue to be 0 for the rest of the period.
(b) In age group 20-24, apart from the decrease due to the decrease in the exposure period, there will be some increase due to reduction in the proportion of widowhood and also reduction in secondary sterility. Rough calculations show that the net effect of all these changes will be a reduction in the specific fertility rates from 130 to about 110.
(c) When the new cohort of those

who married under the changed conditions of marriage in 1961 reaches the age group 25-29, there will be an increase in the specific fertility rates due to a decrease in the proportion widowed, decrease in proportion sterile and lowering of the average parity of women of this age group. Our calculation shows that the specific fertility rates for this cohort might increase by about 15 units from 121 to 136. (d) Similar changes are expected in other age groups when the new cohort reaches those age groups. The estimated specific fertility rates are shown in Table 3.
Projections based on these assump-
tions of fertility and mortality result in
the crude birth rates shown in Table 4.
We may therefore conclude that if
Indian women are not allowed to marry
before the age of 20, the immediate ef-
fect is a decrease of about 10 to 11 births
per 1,000 population or a relative reduc-
tion of about 25 percent. The long-term
effect will be much less. The decrease
may range between 8 and 21 percent (see
Table 4). Our best estimate is a reduc-
tion of about 16 percent in the national
birth rate.
