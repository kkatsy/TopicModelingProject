REPORT OF MEDICAL GENETICS COURSE AT BAR HARBOR

During the month of August, 1960 a course in Medical Genetics was given at Bar Harbor by the members of the faculty of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and of the Roscoe B. Jackson Memorial Laboratory. The American Eugenics Society provided grants-in-aid to attend this course to 13 members of medical school faculties from the states of New York, New Jersey, Vermont and Connecticut.
The course, limited to 40 students, was conducted at Oakes Center. Classes were held from 8:30 A.M. to 12:30 P.M., and from 8:00 to 10:00 P.M. During the initial sessions, topics of basic interest in genetics, e.g. meiosis, mitosis, Mendelian heredity, population genetics, and histo-compatibility were discussed. Biochemical genetics, cytogenetics and statistical methods were discussed from various points of view. Cytogenetics, with its many recent advances, -was particularly well handled and was of great interest to the medically oriented students.
During the afternoon or late evening the students had an opportunity to see selected films of the recent McGraw-Hill series on genetics. Many of these movies were exceptionally good. Since many of the students were concerned with teaching of genetics to medical students, the

opportunity to see these films was most welcome. During the latter part of the course, there was a discussion of hereditary disorders of humans and of the frequently similar syndromes in animals, particularly in mice.
The course was well organized, and well presented. It offered a brief broad glimpse into many areas of genetics; such survey is of particular value to physicians whose interest in genetics is often confined to one particular aspect of the subject. While the limited time obviously dictated certain limitations in material, it seemed unfortunate that nucleic acids and bacterial genetics received little attention.
Obviously a successful course of this variety requires a great deal of labor, and the faculty from Hopkins and from the Jackson Laboratory are to be congratulated on their achievement. Such a course fulfills a real need in medical genetics at this time, and we hope that they will continue their fruitful educational collaboration.
