whether or not observed trends, for instance, the process of leveling the fertility differentials, will maintain themselves. It should be stressed here that two follow-ups should be organized in order to make the research project more fruitful and to secure comparable data. First, the same investigation can be repeated within a couple of years. Second, another project investigating women married during a five-year period may be carried out after some time.

A total of 11,000 forms were sent to women who had given notice of their intended marriages. In each municipality 1,000 forms were distributed. The percentages of returns varied from 14 to 26, and usable answers from 12 to 24. The average of total returns was 20.6 per cent, and of usable returns, 18.5 per cent. In the large cities--Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and The Hague--the total of 1,000 distributed forms was reached very soon. Hence these returns

In The Netherlands religious views are very important in social life and especially in family matters. Therefore it is important that the usable returns be numerous enough to make comparisons among persons with different church affiliations. Such com-

If we consider the data on family size reported in the 1947 census and distinguished as regards church affiliation and occupation and compare these data with our collected material, they are to a great extent similar. The same leveling trend is to be observed, and this time we have not only figures on family size but also stated wishes and comments that are often very striking.

Meaning of Results
The purpose of this summary is only to describe this project which was undertaken in The Netherlands to measure the desired size of family. Therefore no elaborate sur-

vey of the results will be given; only some conclusions will be mentioned.
In addition to the difference in opinion between Roman Catholics and Calvinists (who want to a much greater extent a family of three or more children) and the others, it is significant that among female manual workers there are proportionately more women who wish a small family than among non-manual workers. The same difference exists between women marrying manual workers and those whose future husbands belong to the professional and other intellectual classes. Most women hope to have fewer children than their parents had. The minority, which hopes to have more children, came from families with one or two children.
As several women desired an indefinite number of children, no exact average family size was computed. Table 4 gives information as to the number of children the women in different occupational groups would like to have.
Table 5 shows how the size of the family of the women's parents is related

to the size of the family they would like to have themselves.
Table 6 demonstrates the decrease in desired family size, differentiated by church affiliation.
The most conspicuous finding is that the Calvinists ("Gereformeerden") are less in favor of a small family than the Roman Catholics.

On the whole the results of the investigation were very satisfactory in that they clarified the motivations behind registered birth rate trends. The mail-questionnaire method proved workable. Analysis of the spontaneous comments led to interesting results. The women who wished less than three children mentioned overpopulation, financial circumstances, the possibilities of education and professional training, and
