FRANZ J. KALLMANN, 1897-1965
The distinguished career of Dr. Franz J. Kallmann as researcher and teacher came to a close with his death on May 12. His contributions to the field of human genetics were established with his classic work on the genetics of schizophrenia. By 1936, his opposition to Nazi laws requiring compulsory sterilization of mentally ill patients had made his position in his native Germany scientifically untenable. Coming to the United States, he founded almost single-handedly the discipline of psychiatric genetics in this country. He had a genius for selecting significant topics for investigation at a time when their genetic implications were generally ignored, if not actively opposed. In addition to his major work on schizophrenia and manic-depressive psychosis, he was known for his studies of homosexuality, various forms of mental deficiency, aging and longevity, tuberculosis and early deafness.
To those who knew him chiefly through his writings or presentations at professional meetings, one of Dr. Kallmann's notable characteristics was his ability to convey research findings and concepts with force, imagination, and elegance. Closer associates were particularly aware of his perseverance in the face of hardships, of the thousands of miles he traveled, and the extraordinarily long hours he and Helly Kallmann worked to gather field data in which were reflected the highest standards of thoroughness. Enjoying these activities immensely, he communicated his enthusiasm to all of us who traveled with him.
His absorption in research did not prevent him from developing a wide variety of interests, ranging from music and art to baseball, tennis, and soccer. Dedicated throughout to the principles of responsible and empathic genetic counseling, he could always find time in an overburdened working schedule for those who came to him for advice.
As members of his department and long-time co-workers, we share his loss with the scientific community. Individually, we will long remember the professional and personal guidance that he gave for so many years.
