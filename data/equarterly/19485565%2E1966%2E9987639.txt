INTRODUCTION
In the complex etiology of female breast cancer only four sets of causal factors are accepted fairly broadly: hormonal, familial, ethnic, and factors associated with parity. The importance of endocrines is indicated particularly by patients' remissions following premenopausal castration and postmenopausal hormone therapy, but no clear hormonal hypothesis has yet been advanced. Prevailingly higher risks of breast cancer among mothers and sisters of patients than among unrelated controls matched in age and environmental background have been clearly demonstrated, but no genetic analysis can ignore the possibilities of environmental factors that may also "run in the family." Differences in morbidity and mortality rates of breast cancer between populations are impressive, with multiples of six to ten in contrasts such as between Japanese and European samples, whether of females or of males; but they have not yet been explained. An inverse association between parity and breast cancer seems to be generally accepted, with highest rates among childless women and lowest among mothers of several children, particularly if the children are breast-fed; but it has been impossible to determine whether higher parity is correlated with the effects of lactation, with the effects of pregnancy per se, or both.
The purpose of the present review is to consider possible reasons for higher rates of breast cancer among most Caucasian populations in contrast with those

among almost all non-Caucasians. Carcinoma of the breast kills more women than carcinoma at any other site among "United States whites" today. After an outline and comments on various population data, the evidence for genetic and certain environmental effects will be reviewed and discussed, as background for commenting on some of the more outstanding differences in breast cancer rates between populations.
To attribute any component part of these differences to race per se without further explanation would be begging the question. Differences in gene frequencies between populations today are primarily the result of differential rates of natural selection that have operated over many generations, reflecting specific differences in the populations' environments. Insofar as the population differences in question are genetically controlled, the problem, then, is to discover a pair of contrasting ecological factors which have been imposing for centuries different rates of survival or selection, in the Darwinian sense, on Caucasian populations as compared with non-Caucasians.
Such a contrast is suggested in the artificial feeding of infants the milk of domestic animals, which has been practiced by the ancestors of Caucasians from remotest times, but by no other race, with minor exceptions. It is suggested as an hypothesis that the widespread artificial feeding of milk to infants may have permitted the survival of children whose mothers had larger numbers than usual of genetic factors, or "abnormal

mutant alíeles," which, it is assumed, contribute to limiting the lactation efficacyof some women. Such an hypothesis was indicated by Levin (1963, pp. 10-11). Among non-Caucasians the children of such women have usually died, since their mothers could not provide adequate artificial baby food. Thus the population frequency of the "abnormal" genes has not increased very much above their mutation rates. As these genes accumulated in frequency among Caucasian populations, they may have produced higher rates of breast cancer.
The various assumptions underlying this hypothesis will be examined and its rationale appraised, after noting some of the more striking population differences in mortality rates.
PART 1. POPULATION DIFFERENCES
IN BREAST CANCER FREQUENCIES
The salient feature in the worldwide distribution of breast cancer mortalities is the uniformly higher rates in populations of European descent. Within Europe itself the rates are highest in the northwest, declining in concentric circles to minimae in Greece, Portugal, and Spain. Rates of whites in Australia, South Africa, and South America are not very different from those in Europe or North America. Among non-Caucasians it appears that African Negroes may have higher rates than others; and East Asians, much lower rates. Chinese may have slightly higher rates than other East Asians of non-Caucasian descent. The very lowest rates may be those of Eskimos. Unfortunately, statistics are insufficiently reliable to permit very firm statements for any non-European population but the Japanese, whose rates during recent decades have

been from one-seventh to one-tenth those of Europeans.
Death rates for breast cancer among females per 100,000 population in a few selected countries are presented below from two sources: (A) WHO, 1963, Table 7.3.2., pp. 386-427--crude rates (followed by ratio of breast cancer deaths from all malignancies xlOO, in parenthesis); and (B) Segi and Kurihara, 1964, p. 113--age-adjusted rates. The principal cause of differences between the two sources lies in the age differences. Both sets of figures are for the years 1960-61.

Chile. These countries have substantial admixtures of American Indian ancestry, and it is probable that their records, postmortems, and so on are not complete. It is possibly for the latter reason that they are omitted from Segi and Kurihara's tabulation (B, above).
The departure of Finnish mortality rates from the high levels prevalent in northwestern Europe may be associated with the relatively recent arrival in the Baltic area of substantial proportions of the ancestors of modern Finns, as indicated by their blood-groups, language, and other cultural evidence. They are believed to have come from central Siberia during the neolithic era. Breast cancer may be less frequent in Siberia than in Europe.
Ceylonese data appear fairly reliable (Cooray, 1954).
There is good reason to give full acceptance to the markedly low rates of Japan as noted above. Age-adjusted Japanese mortality data are believed to be fully dependable. They are paralleled by age-adjusted prevalence rates (i.e., incidence rates) such as the following (for Miyagi Prefecture, population 1,727,044, contrasted with 10 U. S. cities for 1957 and 1952, from Segi et al., 1957a).

While cancer at all sites is about twice as frequent among females of corresponding ages in the U. S. A. as in Japan, breast cancer is about five times as frequent.
During the past 20-odd years female deaths from breast cancer have risen

among Japanese aged 70 or over. At younger ages, particularly among the poorer classes, they are virtually unchanged (Segi and Kurihara, 1960, p. 182).
Japanese in Hawaii have somewhat higher rates than in Japan, although they are lower than other races living near them in Hawaii. Their lower rates in general have been attributed to their habit of longer nursing (Strode, 1956), and it is well known that breast-feeding is more frequent and of longer duration in Japan than in most "western" countries. Japanese in Hawaii have produced age-adjusted mortalities considerably lower than other racial groups, but not so low in contrast with Caucasians as indicated above on national bases, according to 1947-54 data of Quisenberry (1960):

T. Hiramaya notes in a personal communication to Quisenberry (1960) that Japanese female deaths from breast cancer are about three times as frequent in Hawaii as in Japan. Quisenberry comments (1961) that "Japanese women in Hawaii have been slower in giving up nursing of their children than have Caucasian, Hawaiian and part-Hawaiian women. This probably accounts at least in part for the low incidence of cancer of the breast among Japanese women" [in Hawaii]. While this statement seems

4 Post Eugen. Quart.

entirely reasonable in explanation of much of the difference between Japanese and Caucasian rates, it does not necessarily account for the entire difference. The remaining component of difference may well be genetic.
It may be noted here that Japan had virtually no milk animals until the 1860's and virtually no dairies or mass consumption of milk until about 1910 or later. Today milk consumption is very low except in greater Tokyo and the island of Hokkaido, where most of the dairies are located. These are the two areas where breast cancer rates are notably higher than the national rate. Standardized mortality ratios for 1954-- 56 were over 130% for Hokkaido and from 115% to 130%, for Tokyo areas, while no other Prefecture exceeded 115%, on the national basis of 100% (Segi and Kurihara, 1960, p. 183). Presumably these differentials arose only a few generations ago and are largely environmental. Could they be associated with a latent nonhuman mammalian virus (e.g., polyoma)?
A similar situation is found among American Indian populations. Hoffman (1915, p. 220) has reported breast cancer rates as low as in Japan. Smith (1957, p. 391) reported age-corrected rates for American Indians in the United States in a base population of 428,225 that were about one-third the U. S. white rate. The numbers of American Indian deaths recorded per year 1949-52 from breast cancer--40 females and 1 male-- seem very low. The numbers expected in comparison with U. S. nonwhites are 104 females and 2 males; in comparison with U. S. whites, 124 females and 1.8 males. Steiner (1954) and Haenszel (1961) have reported Mexican migrant laborers' rates of about one-half those of Caucasian laborers. These figures are

not age-corrected and are based on nonrandomized samples of racially mixed people. It may be surmised that Indian and Mexican mothers nurse their infants more than do U. S. whites and that fewer nonparous women are included. Despite all the weaknesses of these data and despite the marked environmental differences between the two groups, it seems reasonable to suspect that some part of the explanation of their lower breast cancer rates may be genetic.
Eskimo data are even more scarce, but the breast cancer rate among them appears to be even lower than among Indians. Search for breast cancer in the literature of the past 10 years has revealed but a single Eskimo case. It is reported by Thomas (1961) among 13 carcinomas in a population of 850 Eskimos of both sexes during a 10-year survey.
Explanations of lower rates among Japanese and American Indians have been suggested in two fields--dietary and hormonal--but no specific point has been made. It has been said that Mongolian races differ from Caucasians in having lower pituitary function and lower basal metabolism; but, even so, the relation to breast cancer would not be clear.
It is interesting to note that in India Parsee women have breast cancer rates about three times higher than those of Muslim and Hindu controls (Paymaster, 1956; Khanolkar, 1961). While this is generally attributed to such causes as their higher rates of endogamy, later marriage, and earlier weaning of children, it may also be pointed out that Parsees are largely of Caucasian descent. Their ancestors, Aryan-speaking refugees from Iran during the Muslim wars, have intermarried very little with nonCaucasians.

Jewish populations have been frequently said to have more breast cancer than do other Caucasians (Table 1). This has been reported among several samples in New York by Newill (1961) and Schottenfeld and Lilienfeld (1963). Sorsby (1931) has reported higher rates among Jews than non-Jews in Budapest and Vienna but equal rates in London, Amsterdam, and Warsaw, attributing the discrepancy to the two former cities' having higher frequencies of intellectual Jews who marry later in life, have fewer children, and probably nurse them less than Jewish women in the latter three cities. Kallner (1962), comparing agespecific mortalities of occidental Jews in Israel with those of non-Jews in five European countries, indicates that the former have lower rates at ages 45 and over, but higher rates at ages 25 to 44. Oriental Jews in Israel have lower rates than either occidental Jews of Israel or non-Jews in the five European countries among all age groups. This observation

is reported also by Bertini and Ber (1964).
Negro populations appear to have more breast cancer than other nonCaucasians but less than Caucasians (Denoix, 1957; Lewis, 1942; Lewison, 1955; Oettlé and Higginson, 1958). Uttley (1959, 1960) has reported Negroes of Antigua, B.W.I., as having from one-half to one-third the mortality rates of Great Britain. Watler et al. (1961) reported about the same rates among Jamaican Negroes as among whites in Jamaica, with still lower rates among African Negroes, offering no explanation. Oceanic Negroes of Papua and New Guinea have less cancer of the breast than do Caucasians in relation to the frequency of malignancies at other sites, according to a study by Farago (1963). viz. 52 breast cases in a total of 461 tumors among females, ages unstated.
Probably the most reliable and most significant comparisons between Negroes and whites are offered by U. S. national data, since the methodology of ascertainment of the two groups is similar, and sample sizes are very large. In 1960-61 the age-adjusted death rate of females from breast cancer per 100,000 population among U. S. nonwhites was 19.51, contrasted with 21.38 among U. S. whites (Segi and Kurihara, 1964, p. 113). A similar difference is found throughout recent decades. Percentages of total deaths from all neoplasms in 1958-59 of these two groups were, respectively, 15.6 and 19.2 (Segi and Kurihara, 1963, p. 58). Incidence rates (i.e., prevalence rates) for breast cancer indicate somewhat greater differences. In 10 large cities during 1937 the age-adjusted incidence rates per 100,000 population for white and nonwhite women were, respectively, 66.2 and 49.4. The percentage of increase is 134 (66.2/49.4), far smaller

than those of European populations in general over Japanese. The nomvhite rate can be adjusted to 43.8 by estimating their white ancestry at one-quarter (Roberts, 1955), which produces a percentage of increase of 151. Corresponding figures for 1947 are rates of 72.6 and 53.9, percentage of increase of 135; corrected, 72.6 and 47.7, 152% increase. Negro rates are consistently lower than Caucasian but much higher than the rates of all other races.
Population differences in breast cancer among males reveal the same principal observations noted above for females-- the exceptionally low rate in Japan, the relatively low rate in Finland compared with other Caucasian populations, the relatively high rate of "U. S. nonwhites," and even higher rates of "U. S. whites." Pertinent data are summarized in Table 2. Higher male breast cancer rates have also been reported among Jews in New York than among non-Jewish whites,

which again parallels the situation among females (Table 1).
Schottenfeld and Lilienfeld (1963) comment that "probably the most striking epidemiological feature [of male breast cancer] is the low mortality . . . in Japan and Finland, countries which also have low mortality rates from breast cancer in females. Whether these differences are environmentally or genetically determined is difficult to assess." These authors look forward to analyzing data on first- and second-generation Japanese and Finns in the United States as part of a comprehensive investigation of breast cancer among males.
The parallel between male and female mortality rates among various populations strengthens the hypothesis of population differences in the frequencies of genetic factors. It weakens, but does not eliminate, those environmental hypotheses that concern females exclusively.
These environmental hypotheses are further weakened by the interpopulation differences amongfemales atyounger ages, even though early onsets are relatively rare. Female breast cancer death rates in 1960-61 prior to age 24 in Japan were about one-quarter those of "United States whites," rising from 26% and 27% in successive quinquennial age groups to reach 29% by ages 35-39 (Table 3). Whatever protective effects parity or lactation might provide would be less effective at these earlier ages, particularly if retarded a few years in manifestation.
In conclusion, four points appear noteworthy. The few non-Caucasian populations that have markedly high rates of female breast cancer include somewhat larger numbers of childless women and of mothers who limit or curtail lactation than do other populations of the same race. Examples include the Japanese in Hawaii and Tokyo, who have higher

rates than the average of Japan, and "nonwhites" in the United States, who have higher rates than African Negroes.
Secondly, it is reasonable to attribute the extraordinarily low rates among some Caucasian populations--such as those of southern Europe and certain

Latin American nations--to incomplete recording. The gradual increase of rates in these countries from year to year has continued to the latest year of record; whereas in the U. S., Britain, and certain other northern European countries there has been no recent increase, a situation that suggests that the diagnosis and recording of breast cancer deaths in these countries has now reached a plateau of high reliability.
Thirdly, it is noted that high rates of breast cancer occur in several Caucasian nations where breast-feeding is the rule, such as in Scotland and Sweden. While the first point indicates environmental factors, the third point indicates genetic factors. No reason is found to exclude the hypothesis that environmental and genetic factors are additive and complementary.
Lastly, the rarity of milk consumption in Japan and Ceylon and among American Indians is noted. In Japan, the two areas where milk consumption is greater than average are precisely the two areas with elevated breast cancer mortality--metropolitan Tokyo and the Prefecture of Hokkaido. These changes are so recent that they have no genetic implications.
While no final explanation of population differences in breast cancer rates is yet possible, it might be pointed out that genetic differences between populations are well established not only in "markers" such as blood groups and other biochemical traits, but also in genetic diseases. Thus, for instance, the Japanese have higher frequencies than do Caucasians in hereditary night blindness (Noguchi's disease), lower frequencies in Huntington's chorea and the muscular dystrophies. Such differences appear racial: "no environmental explanation is evident. The implication of a genetic

component in the population differences in breast cancer is proportional to the evidence of its heritability. This subject is discussed later in Part 4.
PART 2. PARITY AND LACTATION
A number of authors have reported a marked negative association between breast cancer and childbearing (bibliography in Day, 1958, pp. 24-28). This association, or correlation, seems to be generally accepted, although some studies have failed to confirm it (MacMahon and Feinleib, 1960; Segaloff, 1958). No satisfactory analysis has been made of the differential effects on breast cancer of full-term pregnancy with lactation versus without lactation; in other words, the differential effects on breast cancer of lactation per se. This hiatus in our understanding of breast cancer is conspicuous and unfortunate.
Kamoi (1960) has compared the total lactation time in years between 811 breast cancer patients and 1239 unaffected controls. The latter exceeded the former by significant margins in all age groups over 45, particularly from 55 to 64, whether urban or rural. The negative association between breast cancer and lactation was particularly marked in a subsample of 147 patients with a history of mastitis. Comparisons between the same subsamples of patients and controls with respect to parity gave similar results, as expected. The contrasts in parity appeared slightly less marked than in lactation, however, suggesting that lactation might be more important than parity per se; but it is impossible to separate the effects of the two factors in these data.
Similar conclusions may be drawn from the work of Macklin (1952, 1959b) and Wynder, et al. (1960) on patients and controls of European descent. It

would seem that investigations of European women might produce clearer results insofar as they have higher frequencies of breast cancer and, therefore, may be suspected of having higher rates of (hypothetical) "breast-cancer-producing alíeles" (i.e., a greater genetic variance) than do Japanese women.
Experimental work on mice indicates that lactation offers a protective effect against mammary cancer (Bonser et al., 1961, p. 405). It is tempting to extrapolate these results to humans.
Wynder et al. (1960) were unable to separate the effects of parity from those of lactation. They suggest the hypothesis that risk of breast cancer may be reduced by any factor that reduces or changes endocrine function, such as pregnancy, early menopause, castration, or excessively long aggregate time devoted to nursing, any of which may reduce the aggregate number of menses by the age of menopause (in this context, the endocrine functions considered are those related to the menstrual cycle). These authors indicate that nursing per se may not have a direct effect on breast cancer risk, since the great decrease in breastfeeding of recent decades has not been accompanied by a corresponding decrease in breast cancer, whereas pregnancy may reduce breast cancer risks insofar as it limits menstruation.
Other authors who have suggested hypotheses of a causal relationship between breast cancer and hormonal variation include Olch (1937) and Smithers (1952). The former reported that 54.7% of 342 breast cancer patients over the age of 50 had reached the menopause after the age of 50, which is almost five times as many as had equal delay in menopause in a control series of women without breast cancer. MacMahon and Feinleib (1960) also found later menopausal age

among patients than among controls. De Waard (1960) suggests that earlier onset of breast cancer may be associated with ovarian dysfunction, and later onset with adrenal dysfunction involving excessive estrogen production.
These comments suggest several fields for investigation. Among the questions that arise are: (1) Do high rates of miscarriages and/or stillbirths have the same effect in reducing breast cancer as do high rates of parity? (2) Does a single normal pregnancy with normal lactation of several months confer more than half as much protection against breast cancer as do two pregnancies, or one-third of three, etc? Such investigations would not appear too impracticable.
From the above considerations, the most obvious question that arises for the geneticist is whether the hypothetical genes that might appear necessary for the production or induction of breast cancer may act simultaneously in limiting the lactation function, as a pleiotropic effect; or whether, perhaps, they mayact directly on lactation alone and thereby produce breast cancer as a secondary effect. Such a problem would be more difficult to investigate.
Evidence of the negative association between breast cancer and lactation is strengthened by data on laterality differences. Left breasts have prevailingly higher cancer rates than do right breasts for married women under 70 among Caucasians, Negroes, and Japanese. Less marked differences in rates between left and right breasts were found among single women, and no difference among women over age 70. Left-right ratios for pooled samples of Caucasian women averaged 1.05 and for Negroes, 1.03, from a survey of the literature on 14 samples totaling 10,252 patients by Garfinkel et el. (1959). Their own data for Caucasians give ratios of 1.05 for single

women and 1.12 for ever-married women, regardless of age. Left-right ratios of breast cancer among males averaged 1.33 in pooled data of 347 cases.
Laterality in milk yield and fat content was investigated among 695 British mothers by Hytten (1956). Significant differences between left and right breasts were found in 96% for yield, and in 92% for fat content.
Laterality in hypolactation was found to be associated with breast cancer by Segi et al. (1957b, pp. 45 and 46). The ratio of left breast cancer to right was 1.29 among 1478 patients, of whom 414 were classified as having "poor milk secretion." Among these the ratio of hypolactation of left breasts to right was115 to 84,or 1.37. Among 1403controls with "poor milk secretion" 18% had hypolactation of the left breast; 11% of the right breast; and 71% of both breasts. The 414 patients with hypolactation were subdivided as follows:

Hypolactation

Breast cancer

Left Right Bilateral

Left Right Bilateral Total

95 26 113 234

18 45 96 159

2 13 6 21

The association is highly significant, x2(4)

for heterogeneity being 69, while among

the 184 unilateral cases (95 + 18 + 26 + 45) x2(1) is 41.5 (P<.001). This as-

sociation is significant at the 5% level

for each of four sub-groups--urban and

rural, with cancer of either the left or

the right breast.

i

No clear explanation of laterality phe-

nomena has been found, but the associa-

tion in laterality between breast cancer

and hypolactation does suggest a func-

tional relationship. Segi et al. (1957b, p.

45) comment that in order to explain

10 Post Eugen. Quart.

"why cancer of the breast is more frequent on the left side, it seems we should first make it clear why dyslactation of the left breast is more frequent than that of the right." Segi and Kurihara (1960, p. 183) note that "when one of the mammae shows deficient milk secretion, it is overwhelmingly more frequent that this mamma becomes the site of subsequent cancer than otherwise." Garfinkel et al. (1959, p. 629) conclude that "the development of breast cancer associated with poor milk secretion can only account for a minor proportion of the total left/right difference. . . .In terms of the total left/right ratio in the Japanese data, the association of poor milk secretion with the development of cancer can only account for perhaps one-fifth of the difference."
The last observation is consistent with the hypothesis that breast cancer is associated with and possibly produced by a number of different factors, two of which are dyslactation and genetic factors, the effects of which are independent and additive. Dyslactation itself may also have a genetic basis.
PART 3. ON THE GENETICS OF
BREAST CANCER
An impressive roster of studies have testified to the increased frequencies of breast cancer among various types of female relatives of patients, whether living or dead, contrasted with the frequencies among nonrelated controls. The results of some studies were inconclusive. In other studies there was a trend towards an increased risk among female relatives that failed to reach the level of statistical significance, possibly because of small sample size. In only one study (Murphy and Abbey, 1959) did the risk among sisters seem less than the risk among controls. Since the studies vary

widely in plan, the results cannot be pooled, nor can they be evaluated on a single standard as to statistical reliability. Methods of ascertainment vary particularly, as do the choices of controls, some of which are based on mortality or morbidity rates of the general population of females of similar age; others, on controls unrelated to the patient probands. Results that can be expressed in the form of risk among the relatives of patients (K) as estimated from comparisons with the general population (Penrose, 1953) or with unrelated controls (Macklin, 1952) are summarized from Tables 4 and 5 at right.
Twin studies have not contributed estimates of heritability, since insufficient numbers have been reported at advanced ages (Bonser et al., 1961; Busk, 1948).
There is no evidence that the relatives of breast cancer patients have an increased risk of cancer at other sites (Anderson et al., 1958; Macklin, 1959; Penrose et al., 1948; Smithers, 1948; Woolf, 1955).
Since familial factors need not be necessarily genetic, the possibility of environmental factors "running in the family" must be considered. For example, a family tradition for suppressing lactation artificially may be passed from mother to daughter, or between sisters; likewise, dietary practices and exposure to similar infections; or a viral strain, passing in mothers' milk from one generation to another. However, no direct evidence of a "milk factor" has been reported in man (Bonser et al., 1961, p. 134), nor of the polyoma virus, carried by saliva or excreta (Stewart, 1960).
Evidence against such nongenetic hypotheses as a "milk factor" is indicated by comparisons between the risk figures of patients' maternal female relatives in comparison with their paternal female

Vol. 13, No. 1

relatives of similar degree. Genetic factors would be expected to produce similar risks in maternal as in paternal relatives, assuming autosomal multifactorial control. In the contrasts between maternal and paternal aunts or maternal and paternal grandmothers in Tables 4 and 5 there is no consistent dissimilarity. As Macklin (1959a, p. 950) states, the marked resemblance between breast cancer rates of maternal and paternal aunts (2.7 and 3.2, respectively, in her data, above) and of maternal and paternal grandparents (4.0 and 3.6, respectively), "presuppose either an almost identical paternal and maternal environment, which is difficult to accept, or a genetic component in the determination of breast cancer."
Another indication against the hypothesis of a "human milk factor" is the relatively higher rates of breast cancer that prevail among the classes or strata

that practice the very least breast-feeding, and vice versa. This negative association is found within nations as well as between them.
In conclusion, it may be said that a sister or daughter of a breast cancer patient runs from two to three times the risk of unrelated women of the same age. Since the risk varies considerably between families, being very high, indeed, in some, close relatives of patients should have thorough breast examinations quite frequently. It seems probable that breast cancer is a rather heterogeneous "family" of malignant tumors rather than a single entity, which may explain part of the variation in risk estimates of different authors.

ism. All adaptive functions in all living things must be influenced by genetic factors, although the degree of this influence may be small in certain situations. Heritability of lactation in laboratory animals and dairy cattle has been shown to be rather low in comparison with that of other functions. Most estimates fall between .25 and .38 for cow

milk production and between .33 and .57 for butterfat (Hutt, 1964, p. 338; Shrode and Lush, 1947, p. 231). Yet, the improvements in cow milk production accomplished by a few generations of selective breeding have been spectacular, in both quantity and quality, which is proof enough of additive heritability. Genetic control by polygenes ("additive

the mother-daughter resemblances are substantial.
Similar results were reported by Pfändler (1949). Among 217 women whose mothers were breast-feeders, 182 were also breast-feeders, but 35 were not; among 118 women classed as daughters of non-breast-feeding mothers, 58 were themselves breast-feeders, and 60 were not. Again, the positive association between mothers and daughters is significant (P<.001). Pfändler considers a number of environmental factors in detail, but concludes that lactation is conditioned or controlled essentially by heredity.
Several authors have emphasized the high proportion of lactation failures

that cannot be explained by either the mother or her pediatrician. This proportion varied from one-to two-fifths of all failures in a number of British studies made under circumstances appearing conducive to breast-feeding, such being the prevailing policy of hospitals and pediatricians. While no author considers it possible to classify women in a clearcut manner according to their ability to produce breast milk, a number of authors express the opinion that unexplained failures may be "genetic" (Gans, 1958; Hytten, 1954d, pp. 1451-1452; and papers in their bibliographies).
The percentages of babies still being fully breast-fed at various ages in several studies are summarized in Table 6.

Two analyses of the causes of lactation failures are summarized later, one at the time of discharge of mother and baby from hospital (Aitken and Hytten, 1960), the other after eight weeks (Robinson, 1943). In the former it is noted that some 80% to 90% of British babies in 1951 were fully breast-feeding upon leaving hospital, the Ministry of Health having reported a percentage of 84.9 of 35,000 cases for that year. Figures at discharge time might reflect biological or constitutional reasons for lactational failure more fully than a few weeks later, when cultural or environmental reasons would be expected to have had more opportunity to commence operating.
Aitken and Hytten (1960) analyzed lactation failures among the 6456 women leaving Aberdeen Hospital in 1951-1953 as follows:

Their sample is large; their thoroughness, impressive. Genetic factors may be suspected, particularly in the first category of failure, and to some degrees in all categories except the third. Decreases in percentages from primiparae to multiparae are statistically significant (P<.01) in the fourth, fifth, seventh, and eighth categories. Among 2461 primiparae there were 396 failures upon leaving the hospital; among 3995 multiparae there were 602 failures. The frequency varied with age as well as with parity, but to smaller

degrees. Association with nutrition, size of body and size of breast was negligible.
Robinson (1943) reports lactation failures at various times up to the seventh month, based on 1100 consecutive cases for which consultation and therapy were sought by mothers at the Infant Welfare Centre in Norris Green, near London, during 1938-1940. The word "failure" is used deliberately, since the mothers appear to have been well motivated in all but about 12% of cases. Particular attention is directed again to the first and largest category: "Insufficient milk, no explanation." Despite every effort to stimulate lactation, the milk is reported to have "just dried up." The results are summarized by the following percentages:

General Insufficient milk, no explanation Temporary failure
Mother's condition
Illness, acute Debility "Felt ill" when feeding Low mentality Menstruation Pregnancy Difficult labor Breast (abscess, etc.) Mastitis Nipples flat Nipples cracked Refusal to nurse Socioeconomic

that milk yield is associated primarily with the amount of functional tissue in the breast. This varies widely, declines progressively with age after 20, and is not very closely associated with the size of the breast. Deficiencies in fat content also vary widely. After the first few weeks following delivery approximately one-fifth of his sample failed to nurse satisfactorily because of insufficient fat content, and approximately one-third failed for a combination of both causes.
Although lactation failure of a conscientious and well-instructed mother may be related to emotional factors and other environmental influences, Hytten points out a marked association between lactation performance and the well-known changes in the development of the breasts during pregnancy. He believes that these cannot be due to emotional or cultural factors insofar as they precede delivery. It seems equally difficult to attribute fat content to exogenous factors (Hytten, 1954c, d). He concludes that "failure of lactation is a real phenomenon," occurring in about 30% of the women in his sample of 148 who stopped nursing within 13 weeks after delivery despite every effort and facility. He disputes the claims of some advocates of breast-feeding that almost all British women can breast-feed if they want to.
A rare and possibly monomeric factor in lactation is reported by Ingold (1960) in a family history of unilateral nonlactation over four generations. The proposita and her mother nursed several children satisfactorily with their right breasts but produced no milk in the left. She described two of the mother's sisters as normal and a third sister as unilaterally affected, also their mother and their maternal grandmother, although uncertain as to which side. The author mentions a report in 1875 of four sisters who failed to lactate in the left breast but

nursed several children each with the right breast alone, apparently quite satisfactorily.
In conclusion, there is reason to assume that the most frequent cause of lactation failure in these studies is genetic. Such is the stated opinion of Dummer (1949); Gans (I958); Hughes (1948); Hytten (1954,1958); Pfändler (1949); and Wickes and Curwen (1957). The frequency of "genuine physical incapacity to lactate" has been estimated at 6% of all British mothers by Dummer (1949) and not less than 5% by Spence (1938). Hytten (1958, p. 58) estimates it as 30% of the 15.5% who are nonlactating upon leaving hospital, equivalent to almost 5% of all women.
If the frequency of women incapable of nursing two weeks after delivery under optimal conditions is higher today than a century ago, we must explain the change of rate in terms of environment. It would be impossible for the population frequency of "genetic nonlactators" to increase appreciably in a few generations. On the other hand, it is quite possible that the frequency of "genetic nonlactators" may be higher in British populations than in certain others, particularly in those of non-European descent. This might reasonably be attributed to greater frequencies of genetic factors for hypolactation in Caucasian populations (Hytten, 1958, p. 58).
From this and preceding sections it would seem reasonable to conclude, first, that among healthy, well-nourished Caucasian women under optimal environmental conditions for lactating, the variation in capacity to lactate is under genetic control to a small but appreciable degree; second, that a frequency distribution of lactation success of Caucasian women would include at its low tail end about 5% of mothers who fail to nurse their infants for even two weeks

without artificial feeding for no obvious reason, and who therefore might properly be termed "genetic hypolactators."
PART 5. ARTIFICIAL FEEDING OF INFANTS
In searching for environmental differences between Caucasian and non-Caucasian populations operating over many generations that might have caused differential selection rates in either breast cancer or lactation, or both, it was noted that Caucasians alone have a very ancient history of domestic animal milk, which is the ideal artificial food for infants. The domestication of all milk-producing animals was accomplished almost exclusively by Caucasians.
The original milk producer was the goat, the first ruminant to be domesticated, beginning some 8000 years ago in the Middle East (Zeuner, 1963, pp. 34, 149). Earliest finds are in Palestine and Persia. Goats and sheep were brought into Europe along the Danubian route with the earliest agriculture, pottery, and associated Neolithic elements.
Cattle were domesticated from various wild stocks between western Europe and northwestern India during early and middle Neolithic times, from approximately 4000 B.C. onwards. In Europe the foremost reason for domestication was probably milk, since the milking of goats appears to have been a very ancient practice throughout this area. Cows' milk has been an important food in northwestern Europe ever since. In India cattle were used primarily for transport, meat, and dung, the last as fuel and as binder for building purposes (Zeuner, 1963, pp. 241-244). Milking came in with the Aryan invasions, has been largely confined to the north, and has never been developed as in Europe. China probably received domesticated cattle primarily from Europe via Turke-

stan, but also from India, since the Indian zebu strain is frequent in southern China. Milking has always been extremely rare in China, cattle being used almost exclusively for labor. The yak, buffalo, and other relatives of western cattle are not milked.
On the great plains from Russia to Mongolia milk has been obtained from mares and asses as well as from goats, sheep, and cattle since the middle of the first millenium B.C. The milking of reindeer was already practiced at the dawn of history by Lapps of Norway and Tungus people of northeastern Siberia. The only other important development of milking among non-Caucasians is the cattle culture of the East African highlands; but while this may have once been more extensive, it is not ancient, probably having been introduced ho more than 1500 years ago (Coon, 1965).
Since it is a reasonable hypothesis that the widespread practice of artificial feeding of infants during the past 100 to 150 generations might have caused a relaxation in the rigor of natural selection in eliminating the abnormal mutant genetic factors assumed to be basic to inadequate lactation of human mothers, it would seem worthwhile to consider artificial feeding of infants among contemporary primitive peoples as well as among early Caucasian cultures.
Opportunity to examine artificial feeding practices among contemporary primitive peoples was provided by the Human Relations Area Files of New Haven, a copy of which is available at the University of Michigan. They contain abstracts on some 8700 cultures. Trait or category Number 853, "Infant Feeding," and Number 862, "Weaning and food training," furnish a rich source of ethnographic information, from which the following notes were taken.
Artificial feeding in some form is--

20 Post Eugen. Quart.

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:28 08 December 2015

or was--practiced almost universally, beginning very soon after delivery. In almost all cultures the mother refrains from nursing her infant until her colostrum has passed, usually on the third or fourth day after parturition. The only exceptions noted to the anticolostrum tabu are Jews and the Maoris of New Zealand (Wickes, 1953, p. 131). Otherwise, it is--or was--almost universal (Ploss et al., 1935; Wickes, 1953, p. 155). The primitive fear of colostrum is noted also throughout ancient Greek and Roman history and mythology but apparently died out in Europe during the 1880's (Levin, 1963, p. 13). The universal custom during these few days is to have the infant suck an adult's finger dipped in a thin gruel, honey, or milk. Perhaps it is allowed to suck a solid object, such as animal fat, which is removed when it causes choking. Breastfeeding is commenced as soon as the mother's milk comes, but supplementary feeding is introduced very frequently, almost always by six months and often earlier. Gruels or soups are preferred; solid foods may be partially masticated by an adult. It is gradually increased in amount while mothers' milk is diminished, ceasing at about the age of two, rarely earlier, and more often at three or four, perhaps not until another child is born. The age of full weaning varies widely among families within the same culture, as well as among cultures.
When a mother dies or is unable to nurse, the infant is usually turned over to a wet-nurse if one is available. Otherwise, it may be fed on the same substances used for supplemental feeding. Mortality is then apt to be high. In some cultures an orphan is customarily buried with its mother without attempting to wean it, particularly by the poor.
No impression was obtained of overall difference in the amount of artificial

feeding between one major area of the world and another, except for tropical Africa, where it was described more frequently and fully in the Area Files. All areas revealed differences between rich and poor. The Area Files include cultures of "primitive" Caucasian populations in North Africa, the Middle East, Balkans, etc., and of "primitives" as close to Japan as Luzon, Southeast Asia, and Northeast Asia. The significant conclusion for the present hypothesis is the universality of some form of artificial feeding supplementary to breast-feeding, suggesting that early weaning on a mass scale by Caucasians once they had domestic animal milk may not have been so radical an innovation as one might think.
Contemporary "primitive" cultures of Caucasians having one or more types of domestic milk-producing animal almost always supply their infants and children with generous amounts of nonhuman milk. The manner of feeding varies widely, from the sucking of fingers or other objects dipped in milk to the use of various types of vessels or the direct sucking at the animals' teats. This last practice would have had the immense advantage of reducing bacterial intake to moderate levels, whereas milk vessels must have become contaminated to a serious degree. Direct sucking has been practiced in the Canary Islands from Neolithic to modern times (Ploss et al., 1935).
Papers by pediatricians have reviewed a wealth of evidence of widespread and frequent artificial feeding of infants in antiquity among Caucasians (Davidson, 1953, p. 75; Garrison, 1923; Hymanson, 1934, p. 2; Wickes, 1953, p. 154; Wood, 1955). Gibbons' explanations of the fall of the Roman Empire include consideration of the abandonment of breastfeeding by patrician women who used to buy slave wet-nurses. Lycurgas, King of

Sparta, promulgated a law about 350 B.C. requiring mothers to nurse their own infants (Hymanson, 1934, p. 1). Indeed, the only Caucasians of antiquity who customarily nursed their own infants were the Jews, according to Davidson (1953, p. 75), who notes that the Mosaic Law required that infants be put to the breast even before the cutting of the cord. Both the Talmud and the Koran required mothers always to suckle their own young, permitting a wet-nurse only in cases of necessity (Lyon, 1933, p. 361).
Archeological evidence of the antiquity of artificial feeding of animal milk is abundant. Clay bottles are characteristic finds in the graves of infants in central Europe from about 900 B.C., those from Swiss lake-dwelling sites of the late Neolithic period being perhaps older. All are ovoid in shape, like an American football, with a large opening at the top protected by a long neck for filling and a nipple-like projection at one end for sucking. Most are equipped with four small feet for stability. They contain about a half pint of fluid. Some of the most ancient are illustrated by Lacaille (1950).
Greek and Roman graves have furnished great quantities of feeding bottles, generally of superior workmanship. Most were of well-baked pottery, but in later times many were of glass. They have been found in all areas of the Roman Empire but were particularly frequent in France, southern Britain, and Germany. Most of the graves date from the first century B.C. to the fifth century A.D., according to coins and other objects found in them. They varied widely in shape, from teapotlike to spouted pitchers, some of them resembling the human breast. References to archaeological sources are made by Lacaille (1950). A number of pediatricians have also de-

scribed them, not one of whom doubts the widespread use of milk for infant feeding in antiquity (Brennemann, 1923; Davidson, 1953; Deruisseau, 1940; Garrison, 1923; Lyon, 1933; Wickes, 1953; Wood, 1955, p. 479).
Perhaps the oldest find of its kind is from a suckling's grave of the late Neolithic period at Tours-sur-Marne, dating about 2000 to 1500 B.C. It is a crude vessel with thick, vertical walls and a flat base, both measuring about 4.4 cm. Open at the top, it has a nipple-shaped spout about 1 cm. long protruding outwards and downwards, obviously for sucking (Lacaille, 1950). Archaeologists appear to have no doubt of its purpose. And there is no doubt whatsoever about the abundance of domestic animal milk throughout most of Europe at that time; nor, indeed, for several centuries previously.
There is no archaeological evidence of nursing bottles among the ancient Jews (Garrison, 1923, p. 32).
One might wonder whether the unsanitary conditions of antiquity caused many infant deaths, as they did in medieval Europe--actually until recent decades. One wonders whether the infants of mothers who could not nurse, or would not, might have perished from contaminated milk vessels as frequently as if no animal milk had been available. Direct sucking of animals entails less danger.
In ancient Egypt the mural reliefs and frescoes of the temples show that children suckled directly from the udders of cows. The cow-goddess Hathor is thus represented in Item No. 1163 of Sudhoff's Catalogue of the Historical Section of the Dresden Hygienic Exposition of 1911 (Garrison, 1923, Chap. 1, p. 12). The long horns and lean, wiry bodies and limbs of the cows represented with the suckling children--often simultane-

ously with a calf--were characteristic of the cattle of antiquity.
Greek mythology is replete with references to the direct suckling of animals (Levin, 1963, pp. 18-19). Best known were the cases of Romulus and Remus, suckled by a wolf; Cyrus, by a bitch; Zeus and Amalthea (Garrison, 1923, p. 32), Jupiter (Wood, 1955, p. 474), Aesculapius, Dionysus, and the children of Zeus (Ploss, 1899, pp. 418^119), by goats; Pelius, son of Neptune, by a mare; Hercules' son, Telephos, by a doe; and Chloe by a sheep (Levin, 1963). Deruisseau (1940, p. 554) stated that the myths of antiquity concerning children suckling animals "should not be entirely relegated to the realm of fables"; and Wood (1955, p. 474) said that such legends "could not have been as far-fetched as it would seem."
The German physician Conrad Anton Sqierlein (1755-1825) recommended direct nursing from the udder of goats, noting that this practice was frequent among peasants in Germany and Switzerland. He pointed out that goats were far cheaper than wet nurses, that the animals' teats are easy to grasp and its disposition sufficiently friendly to permit becoming accustomed to the infant. A number of foundling homes followed his suggestions, where bottle-feeding was considered unsatisfactory due to the appallingly high mortality then prevalent. Zwierlein recorded repeatedly that the children flourished for two or three months but then almost always developed diarrhoea, which would be fatal unless they were quickly transferred to another diet. It may be assumed that pure goat's milk is too concentrated or strong for infants (Kon, 1959) unless the animal had been recently delivered. The above summary is confirmed in "Geschichte der Methodik der Kunstlichen Sauglingsernahrung," 1908, by Hermann

Brunings, another pediatrician (Deruisseau, 1940, pp. 554-555).
In 1775 a French pediatrician recorded that the Faculty of Medicine in Paris, responding to a request for suggesting how the high mortality in institutions for foundlings might be diminished, especially among those who were drynursed, recommended that they be placed directly at the udders of she-goats--a practice that was then adopted by the Foundling Hospitals of France (Hymanson, 1934, p. 5). The procedure was recorded by Alphonse Le Roy, one of the faculty members, as follows (Drake, 1930, p. 1053):
The cribs are arranged in a large room in two ranks. Each goat which comes to feed enters bleating, and goes to hunt the infant which has been given to it, pushes back the covering with its horns and straddles the crib to give suck to the infant. Since that time they have raised very large numbers [of infants] in that hospital.
The second half of the Eighteenth Century witnessed increased use of animals for infant feedings in institutions, according to Wickes (1953, p. 336), who writes that they had been "widely used before, mainly by the peasant class." He notes one author who recommended the she-ass instead of the goat. She-asses were used during the 1800's at L'Hôpital des Enfants Assistés in Paris, being permanently kept in stalls adjoining the wards (Wickes, 1953, p. 152). Since ass milk is considerably closer to human milk in all ingredients than that of any other animal (Kon, 1959), Wickes' notes are not surprising. Throughout the Nineteenth Century there were wellorganized movements to feed infants at the udders of domestic animals (Wood, 1955, p. 474).

ing of infants since the earliest recorded times are African Negroes. Ethnographic reports of the New Haven Area Files mention mothers throughout central and west Africa giving their infants generous quantities of pre-masticated gruel, often mixed with honey, by the first or second week of life and providing by the end of the first year a wide variety of cooked vegetable foods: bananas, ground nuts, maize, manioc, plantains, rice, sweet potatoes, yams. Meat and eggs were generally prohibited. While no report mentions the antiquity of supplementary baby feeding, it seems reasonable to assume that the practice antedated the introduction of food plants from America (maize, manioc) or Asia (bananas and rice). Plantains and a variety of roots have been cultivated and cooked in tropical Africa for a long time, offering abundant food for infants. Unfortunately, it has been impossible to ascertain how extensively they were actually utilized for infants in remote times.
Artificial feeding of infants has never been practiced extensively in Japan or Ceylon (the countries with lowest breast cancer mortalities of those considered most accurate), nor in aboriginal America.
In conclusion, it is indicated that artificial feeding of infants in small quantities to supplement mothers' milk is found today almost universally among primitive people and has probably been practiced since extremely early cultures, due to the universality of the tabu against colostrum, the "rights" of males (in primitive societies lactating women are apt to be aloof), and mothers' normal desire to give infants maximal nourishment even in an environment of plenty. A wide variety of artificial foods has been used; but none has ever rivaled the use of domestic animal milk, which dates from the earliest Neolithic cultures of Cau-

casian populations and a few neighboring populations such as some of the most westerly Mongolians and some of the most northerly Negroes, but no other populations. Although bacterial contamination of containers must have produced extremely high infant death rates, the direct sucking of animals' teats is fairly safe; and there is plausible evidence that this custom was widely practiced by Caucasians from prehistoric to modern times. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that a substantial proportion of the offspring of hypolactating Caucasian mothers would have lived. To whatever degree hypolactation may be due to "defective mutant genes," these genes would not have been eliminated from Caucasian populations by natural selection so rigorously as they must have been eliminated from all other races.
PART 6. BREAST CANCER AND MILK
CONSUMPTION
In searching for etiological factors that might suggest clues for clarifying interpopulation variation in breast cancer, mortality rates of 29 countries were listed in parallel columns opposite annual per capita production figures of domestic animal milk (Table 7). These are the only countries for which both sets of data are available (WHO, 1963; and FAO, 1964). The association between breast cancer and milk production roughly approximates a straight line, as sketched subjectively in Figure 1 (the data are too crude to warrant mathematical treatment).
Countries departing most widely from this straight line association are shown in the following list, ranked in order of their degree of departure. The milk production per capita and breast cancer mortality of each country are given ("C" and "D," respectively), together with its

The greatest three departures from the association are of nations that consume far less milk than they produce. Two other nations are heavy importers of milk or milk products. More exact figures of domestic consumption would bring these five closer to line. The departure of Finland may be explained by "racial" ancestry, as mentioned previously.
Breast cancer and milk production are both fairly highly associated with the degree of material or economic development of these nations, which suggests that the interassociation of the two variables may be quite spurious.
An association has also been noted between breast cancer and cigarette smoking among these countries. This, also, may be spurious.
Two other clues for explaining racial or ethnic differences in breast cancer

mortality rates are suggested by the smaller average mass of breast tissue of most Mongoloids, and their genetically distinct type of ear wax, which is produced by sebaceous glands distantly homologous with the mammary glands. The type that is almost universal among Mongoloids is dry, hard, light in color, and odorless, in contrast with the type predominant among Caucasoids and Negroids (Matsunaga, 1962).
For further consideration of the epidemiology of breast cancer, reference may be made to Bonser et al. (1961), Day (1958), Lilienfeld (1963), Wynder et al. (1960), and their bibliographies. A number of authors have mentioned the possibility of explaining population differences in breast cancer mortality by diet or endocrines, pointing out, for example, that the Japanese may have different thyroid secretions, lower pituitary output, and lower basal metabolism than have Caucasians. Wynder et al. (1960), discussing hormonal effects, point out that pregnancy and lactation induce ovarian rest and that any factor that reduces endocrine function tends to reduce the risk of breast cancer. None of these observations conflicts with the present hypothesis.
PART 7. SUMMARY AND HYPOTHESIS
1. A review of mortality rates of breast cancer in several nations indicates that most Caucasian populations have higher rates than have most non-Caucasians. The few cases of low rates among Caucasians may be attributed to incomplete or otherwise unreliable statistics, or to admixtures with non-Caucasians. Only one high rate is noted among non-Caucasian populations--that of "United States nonwhites," which is almost as high as the "whites' " rate. Japanese rates are higher in Hawaii and urban

26 Post Eugen. Quart.

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:28 08 December 2015

Tokyo than in rural Japan but are always much lower than any Caucasian rate. Breast cancer mortalities of males parallel those of females among the populations for which data are available.
2. While a number of environmental explanations of population variation have been entertained, the only environmental factor that has been shown to affect breast cancer rates consistently is parity. Its mechanisms of actuation are unknown; the effects of lactation and pregnancy per se have not been separated statistically. The higher mortalities associated with more privileged socioeconomic status are probably attributes of the lower parity that is also associated with this status. Relevant statistics are summarized.
Since Japanese rates are lower than Caucasian rates among males and among adolescent females, the differences cannot be attributed entirely to pregnancy or lactation.
3. The higher risks of breast cancer found by several authors among the nearer female relatives of patients are reviewed. Risks among more distant relatives are lower; among unrelated controls, lower still. Demonstration of equally high risks among paternal grandmothers and paternal aunts of patients in contrast with their maternal grandmothers and aunts, respectively, is considered as evidence for genetic rather than for environmental factors, such as "milk factor" (virus), which could not be transmitted by a patient's father. Multifactorial genetic control of breast cancer is assumed (perhaps better expressed as genetic conditioning). The effects of genetic and environmental factors may be in part additive.
4. Evidence is presented of genetic factors in lactation, the effects of which are also assumed to be in part additive. Studies are reviewed which indicate that

some 5% of British women fail to provide adequate milk for no known specific reason despite apparently ideal environmental circumstances. These women are assumed to have larger numbers than usual of genetic factors that limit lactation. They are termed "genetic hypolactators."
While genetic effects are evident in both breast cancer and lactation, it is not clear whether they depend on two distinct sets of genetic factors or on a single set. If the former, the problem arises of explaining how the cancer-producing factors could be affected by natural selection, since most cases of the disease appear after the reproductive years. If breast cancer and hypolactation are produced by the same set of genetic factors, there would be no such problem.
A single set of factors might produce both hypolactation and breast cancer, as by pleiotropy; or, it might produce only hypolactation directly, which might cause the breast cancer indirectly. In the first case one would expect a positive correlation between hypolactation and breast cancer both within and between populations; in the second case, between populations (Caucasoids would be high in breast cancer and hypolactation; Mongoloids, low) but not necessarily among individuals within a population (component symptoms or "formes frustes" of a syndrome are not often highly intercorrelated).
Whether there be two sets or one, it is also not clear whether the provocative factors are "normal" alíeles such as polygenes, causing no harm unless an individual receives an excessive number, or "abnormal" mutants. To illustrate, excessively short stature may be explained in some cases by individuals' receiving an unusually large number of normal "short-stature alíeles"; in other

Vol. 13, No. 1

cases, by abnormal mutants for dwarfism. The former hypothesis seems preferable.
5. In order to explain the prevailingly higher frequencies of genetic factors assumed to produce breast cancer in Caucasian populations, assuming that they are in some way associated with or dependent upon abnormal genetic factors in hypolactation, the hypothesis is suggested that their rate of elimination by natural selection might have become relaxed or diminished in remote prehistoric times among Caucasian populations-- and in no other--through the widespread development of domestic animal milk as an artificial infant food. Relaxed selection of genetic factors for hypolactation might have caused them to accumulate among Caucasian populations in sufficient frequencies to produce appreciably higher rates of breast cancer in these populations today, even where breastfeeding is the rule.
In support of this suggestion, the use of artificial infant foods among contemporary primitive people and of domestic animal milk among prehistoric and early historic Caucasian populations is outlined.
6. Environmental explanations of population differences are discussed. None seems likely.
7. The hypothesis of relaxation of natural selection explains all interpopulation variation fairly satisfactorily, with the exception of high rates of "United States nonwhites" (i.e., 19 per 100,000 contrasted with 21 for "whites"). If breast-feeding is more frequent among "nonwhites," as suspected, these figures are even more difficult to explain. Two suggestions are offered. The Caucasian ancestry of American Negroes, which has been estimated at one-fourth to one-fifth, may have greater effect than expected, perhaps because of environmental simi-

larities between "whites" and "nonwhites" in the United States. Another suggestion is that African Negroes have been using tropical plants as artificial baby foods since remote times in sufficient quantities to relax selection against lactation genes almost as much as is assumed among Caucasians resulting from the use of domestic animal milk.
8. No explanation is offered of the mechanics of the possible interaction of breast cancer and hypolactation. Their statistical association is discussed in Part 2; their genetic bases, in Parts 3 and 4.
The fact that high rates of breast cancer, high frequencies of hypolactators, and very ancient histories of domestic animal milk are found in Caucasian populations and in no other suggests that problems of etiology and epidemiology may well be investigated under the hypothesis of relaxed selection.
