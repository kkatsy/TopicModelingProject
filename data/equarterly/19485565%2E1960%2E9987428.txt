INTERMARRIAGE AND FERTILITY PATTERNS AMONG PERSONS IN MAJOR RELIGIOUS GROUPS*

N.! EITHER VITAL STATISTICS nor decen-
nial census figures have provided nationwide statistics on marriage and family patterns among the several religious groups, even though religion has been one of the central characteristics of American culture. A part of the gap can now be filled by data collected by the U. S. Bureau of the Census in March 1957, in connection with the Current Population Survey. (1) This nationwide survey covered a sample of 35,000 households selected scientifically to represent all elements in the population of the nation. An analysis of some of the results of this survey is presented in this paper.
The question on religion was worded as follows: "What is your religion--Baptist, Lutheran, etc.?" The question was restricted to persons 14 years old and over, because some religious groups regard baptized infants as members and others count as members only persons who have "joined" at about 12 to 14 years of age or older. This difference in practice would undoubtedly affect the replies to such a question for persons under 14. In the 1957 survey, the answers to all questions were voluntary;

Grabill in the preparation and review of this paper is gratefully acknowledged.

only one per cent failed to give a reply to the question on religion.
The intent of the question was to elicit each person's religious preference, though the same reply would be expected from most of the people regardless of the phrasing of the question. A preference question maximizes the proportion of the people who can be classified into the several religious groups and avoids the necessity of prescribing such a limiting criterion for inclusion as membership or attendance, both of which present some serious problems of definition. A preference question has the shortcoming, however, of drawing into the count for a given denomination some persons whose attachment to the group is nominal. It is possible that differences between the religious groups with respect to subjects discussed below would have been more distinct if the groups had been more narrowly defined.
DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS
Separate response categories were provided on the enumeration document for each of the six largest religious groups, as shown by official membership figures: Roman Catholic, Baptist, Methodist, Lutheran, Jewish, and Presbyterian. Other categories were also provided for "other Protestant," "other religion," and "no religion." For these groups, data were tabulated for persons 14 years old

and over and, in addition, estimates of the number under 14 years old in each of the major groups were made by classifying family members under 14 according to the religion reported by the family head and his wife (if any). In fam-

ilies with mixed marriages, the author classified half of the children according to the religion reported by the head and half according to that of the wife. (See footnotes in Table 1.)

that two out of every three persons in the United States in 1957 (66 per cent) were reported as (or estimated to be) Protestants, one out of every four (26 per cent) as Roman Catholics, three per cent as Jewish, one per cent as reporting some other religion, and three per cent as reporting no religion; one per cent made no report on religion.
Age--Figures on Protestants (by color), Roman Catholics, and Jews by key age brackets -- young dependent ages, major productive ages, and old age -- bring out the following points: At the extremes, nonwhite Protestants had a far larger proportion of young dependents than the Jews (42 per cent versus 28 per cent). White Protestants and Roman Catholics were intermediate and had about the same proportion of young dependents (34 and 36 per cent, respectively). At the same time, nonwhite Protestants had the smallest proportion in the productive ages and the Jewish population had one of the largest. In the old age bracket were smaller percentages of Protestant nonwhites and Roman Catholics than white Protestants and Jewish persons.
The median ages provide a convenient means for summarizing the differences in age groupings. Thus, the median age for nonwhite Protestants was 24 years, that for Roman Catholics was 29 years, that for white Protestants, 31 years, and that for Jews, 37 years.
The age differences reflect such factors as differences among the religious groups with respect to major period of immigration of the persons (or of their ancestors) and with respect to their birth and death rates during past decades. Persons reporting "other religions" include mainly Eastern Orthodox Catholics and Orientals, many of whom migrated to the United States several decades ago

33
and are now in old age. A relatively large proportion of those reporting no religion were in the adult age groups. It would be of interest to know how many of the middle-aged and older persons reporting no religion would have reported one in their earlier years, and to know how many o£ them would have reported each religion.
Sex--The percentage of men who were reported as Catholics was the same as the percentage of women who were reported as Catholics; likewise for Jewish men and women (Table 2). But three per cent more of the men than women reported no religion and three per cent more of the women than men reported themselves as Protestants. It would be informative to know how many of the men reporting no religion worked in relatively isolated places where there were no religious organizations, and how many were merely indifferent toward religion.
Color-- Seven-eighths of the nonwhites, as compared with five-eighths of the whites, were reported as Protestants. Six per cent of the nonwhites and 28 per cent of the whites were reported as Roman Catholics. So nearly are all nonwhites Protestants that almost any generalization which applies to nonwhite Protestants applies likewise to all nonwhite persons.
Region--In the South, 83 per cent of the persons of all races were reported as Protestants, as compared with 42 per cent in the Northeast and 69 per cent in the North Central region and the West. Approximately half of those reported as Roman Catholics and twothirds of those reported as Jewish were living in the Northeast. The Northeast had the smallest proportion reporting no religion and the West had the largest (4 per cent).

Residence--Among persons reported as Jewish, 96 per cent lived in urban areas. The corresponding proportion was 79 per cent for those reported as Roman Catholics, 57 per cent for those reported as Protestants, and 54 per cent for those reporting no religion.
The unequal distribution of persons in the several religious groups according to the key demographic variables is relevant to the following discussion of family data on religion. (2)
INTERMARRIAGE
In view of the fact that about twothirds of the adults in the United States are reported as Protestants, it would be theoretically possible for every Roman Catholic and every Jewish person to marry a Protestant. In such a hypothetical situation, rates of interfaith marriages for the Roman Catholics and Jews would be 100 per cent but that for Protestants would be less than 50 per cent.
Again, if religious ties were not strong and if other factors, such as race, social class, and geographic location were not to affect the selection of partners in marriage, persons in each religious group would tend to marry persons in any religious group on a random basis. In actual practice, of course, Protestants generally marry Protestants, Catholics generally marry Catholics, and Jews generally marry Jews. The question under discussion is the proportion of the couples who marry in or marry out of their religious group.
From the survey results on religion, it was possible to estimate the actual extent of intermarriage, for comparison with the amount which would have been "expected" on a random basis. Computations were made for married couples in which the husbands and wives were reported as Protestant, Roman Catholic,

or Jewish. In this study, a Protestant husband with a Protestant wife was considered as a couple belonging to the same religious group, regardless of whether they were members of the same or different Protestant denominations.
The findings showed that 94 per cent of the married couples consisted of husbands and wives of the same major religious group. If the couples had been paired off without regard to the religion of their marriage partner, only 56 per cent of them would have had a spouse of the same religion; 44 per cent would have been married to a person in one of the other two major groups. In Table 3 corresponding figures are shown for each of the groups.
Among the couples with either a Protestant husband or a Protestant wife, both the husband and wife were Protestants in 91 per cent of the cases; in the remaining 9 per cent, one of the spouses was reported as a Roman Catholic or a Jew. For couples involving at least one Roman Catholic, 78 per cent were unmixed Roman Catholic couples and 22 per cent were mixed Catholic-Protestant or Catholic-Jewish couples. And for couples involving at least one Jewish partner, 93 per cent were unmixed Jewish couples and 7 per cent were mixed Jewish-Christian.
If all of these couples had consisted of persons of one of the religious groups or another at random, 47 per cent of the Protestants would have been in mixed marriages, instead of the actual 9 per cent. In other words, there were actually only about one-fifth (19 per cent) as many Protestant-Catholic or Protestant-Jewish couples as would have been expected on a random basis.
The rate of mixing was only slightly larger for couples with one or both Roman Catholic spouses. Thus, the actual

mixture rate for Catholic spouses was 22 per cent and the expected rate was 84 per cent, making the actual rate only about one-fourth (26 per cent) as large as the expected rate. The minor differences which appear to exist between the mixture rates for Protestants and Catholics suggests that there is a higher rate of Catholic-Jewish than Protestant-Jewish intermarriage; the sample figures on such couples are quite small.
For couples with one or both Jewish partners, the ratio of the actual mixed marriage rate to the expected marriage rate was only about one-third that of Protestants or Catholics. Specifically, only 7 per cent of the couples with at least one Jewish partner had a Christian partner, whereas fully 98 per cent would have done so if they had married without regard to the religion of their partner in marriage. Hence, only 7 per cent as many Jewish persons outmarried as would have been expected by chance alone. The relatively low intermarriage rate for Jewish persons is no doubt a result in part of such factors as geographic concentration of Jewish population in

urban neighborhoods. In interpreting these "intermarriage"
(or interfaith) mixtures, it should be recognized that some persons change their religion after marriage to conform to that of their spouse, that some enumerators may have failed to follow the instruction to ask for the religion of each person in the household rather than to assume that all had the same religion as the respondent, and that some respondents may have, for one reason or another, misreported the religion of one of the spouses. Probably most of these factors would tend to make the Census Bureau's household survey figures show less mixture among the three major religious groups than marriage records show. (3)
Moreover, intermarriage among denominations within the Protestant group is not reflected in the preceding discussion. There may well be more cultural resistance to intermarriage of persons in some of the widely different Protestant denominations than between Protestants and Catholics or Jews, but the available data did not throw light on this subject.

Some persons reporting no religion may have ceased affiliating themselves with any religious group as a consequence of a conflict between their religion and that of their spouse. It is noteworthy, in this connection, that one million children under 14 years of age were living in families where the head reported no religion, whereas only about one hundred thousand children were in families where the wife reported no religion.
Finally, this study has not dealt with such related topics as differences in age at marriage and in the proportion who ever marry among the several religious groups. Thus, the findings may be affected by the extent to which Protestants tend to marry younger than Catholics and Jews and to which Catholics have a larger proportion in religious and educational work who never marry.
FERTILITY
Differences in the fertility rates for the several religious groups were measured in terms of the average number of children ever born per 1,000 women who had ever married (Table 4). Separate figures were compiled for women of childbearing age (15 to 44 years) and for women past the childbearing age (45

years and over). The rates for women of childbearing age are probably of more current interest than those for older women because they come closer to revealing eventual differences in reproductivity among women in the several religious groups who have been at the height of their childbearing during recent years; however, the rates for these women are affected somewhat by differences in age at marriage and in the timing of births after marriage.
For women of childbearing age, those reported as Baptists had the highest fertility rate. To some extent this finding may be attributed to the fact that about one-third of the Baptists are Negroes, and the fertility rate for Negroes is about 20 per cent above that of whites. Moreover, a majority of the Baptists-- whether currently in urban areas or rural--have probably grown up in the environment of the rural South, where the fertility rates are above those for the nation as a whole.
Despite the common belief--and evidence from other studies--that Catholics have larger families than other persons, (4) the Current Population Survey showed that the fertility rate for Roman

Catholic married women of childbearing age in the country as a whole was not significantly higher than that for married Protestant women in the same age group. (The fertility rates standardized for age, not shown in Table 4, were virtually identical for the two groups, namely, 2,206 for Protestants and 2,210 for Roman Catholics) The explanation lies, in part, in the fact that twice as large a proportion of Protestants as Catholics live in rural areas, and rural fertility rates are about one-fourth again as high as those in urban areas. Moreover, Protestants probably marry at a younger age than Catholics, on the average. Thus, although urban Catholic women may have higher fertility rates than other urban women, the surveyfigures indicate that Catholic women as a group in the entire nation do not have higher fertility rates than other women.
The fertility rate for Jewish women of childbearing age who had married was only about three-fourths as large as that for Protestant and Catholic women. As pointed out early in the paper, virtually all Jewish population in this country is found in urban areas, but the fertility rate for Jewish women was about 14 per cent below that for urban women of all religions combined. Also, according to independent studies, a relatively large proportion of Jewish workers is found in the professional and other white collar occupations, which require more than the average amount of education. (5) Women with husbands in such occupations tend to have 5 to 15 per cent fewer children than the national average. (The sample included only about 500 Jewish ever-married women 15 to 44 years old. This fact serves both as a caution in evaluating the results and as one of the reasons why the data are not shown in greater detail by related

subjects.) The (cumulative) fertility rates in
Table 4 for women 45 years old and over reflect the fertility experience of earlier generations. Here, again, the Baptist women led all the rest, but the Roman Catholic women of this older age range had about ten per cent more children on the average than the entire group of Protestant women. The rate for the older Jewish women, as for the younger ones, was about three-fourths as high as the national average.
The fertility rate for women of childbearing age was about 600 points lower than that for women above childbearing age. This difference is not a mere reflection of the incomplete fertility of the younger women; it also arises, in part, from the fact that, despite the upturn in the birth rate during the 1940's, fertility rates today are still considerably lower than they were 40 or 50 years ago. The point to observe here, however, is that the difference between the fertility rates for women in the two broad age groups varied widely among the several religious groups. For example, the differences between the fertility rates of older and younger women among Baptists and Roman Catholics--clearly the most fertile of the older women--were the largest (about 800 to 900 points). At the other extreme, the Presbyterians had one of the lowest rates among both the younger and older women, and the difference for this denomination was the least (only about 200 points). These and other facts suggest a long-time trend toward the convergence of fertility rates among the religious groups.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The nationwide sample data collected by the Bureau of the Census in 1957 show that, among married couples with

38 Eugenics Quarterly

the husband and wife reported as Protestant, Roman Catholic, or Jewish, about one-fourth to one-fifth as many couples included only one Protestant partner or only one Catholic partner as would have been expected if the persons had married without regard to religion. By contrast, one-fourteenth as many couples included only one Jewish partner as would have been expected on a random basis. Thus, the findings provide statistical evidence that intermarriage occurs much more readily among Protestants and Catholics than between Jewish persons and Christians.
Moreover, Protestant and Roman Catholic married women of childbearing age had borne approximately equal numbers of children per woman, on the average, even though a much larger proportion of Protestants live in, or grew up in, rural areas where fertility rates are relatively high. Among Jewish women of childbearing age and of older ages, the fertility rates were about threefourths as high as those for the country as a whole. Differences between rates for those of childbearing age and rates for older women suggest a trend toward convergence of the fertility levels among women in the major religious groups.
Undoubtedly, the differences between the major religious groups with respect to marriage and fertility patterns which have been shown by the survey data reflect differences in the age, color, geographic, and socioeconomic distributions of these groups as well as differences in religious doctrines with regard to family behavior.
