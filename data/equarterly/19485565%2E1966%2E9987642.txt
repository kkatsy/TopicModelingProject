INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE IN THE STATE OF HAWAII*

The extent of interracial marriage in the United States and its future course is a matter of considerable concern at present, being a highly sensitive aspect of the continuing Civil Rights debate (Shaffer, 1961; U. S. News and World Report, 1963). The control of marriage has been regarded as a constitutional right vested in the states; and although the number of states prohibiting such marriages has been declining, 19 states still define such marriages as punishable violations of the law (Barnett, 1964; Council of State Governments, 1964, p. 439; Mihanovich et al., 1952, p. 221). The prohibition of interracial marriage was challenged successfully at the state level in California in 1948, and most recently the U. S. Supreme Court has ruled that Florida's law on interracial cohabitation is invalid. In view of the fact that Florida recognizes the informal, common-law marriage, this Supreme Court decree has a close bearing upon marriage miscegenation laws, even though the Court did not pass judgment on interracial marriage statutes per se.
Unfortunately, there seems to be a simultaneous effort to achieve complete legal freedom to intermarry and at the same time to remove racial identification from all marriage and vital records, and hence from statistical knowledge. Such was the case in California, where data on

interracial marriage for that state are no longer available (Barnett and Burma, 1965). In the future we shall have even less information if the Negro group, in particular, continues to pressure for invisibility on statistically devised records. A few excellent studies have been made of interracial marriages, especially Negrowhite marriages, but no statistics have been gathered for the continental United States as a whole (Barnett, 1963a, 1963b; Burma, 1963).
Because our knowledge is fragmentary and irregular as to the extent or growth of interracial marriage, it is understandable that opposite viewpoints can be found in current sociological and family literature, as well as in the popular media. The special postmarital difficulties of interracial marriages have also been explored in particular studies, but again in a broad sense the outcome of such marriages is not known because of the absence of generally drawn data. A scanning of reference books and collegelevel texts on the family attests to this. For the continental United States no statistics have been produced that would enable us to specify the relative marital stability of Negro-white unions, or for that matter of any other interracial union. In the State of Hawaii, however, statistics on "interracial" marriage and divorce have been collected and published in some detail for a number of years. At the same time, because of the favorable social climate respecting racial mingling which has a special historical

explanation, intermarriages are quite extensive.
REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
In his classic study over a generation ago, Romanzo C. Adams assembled the data on intermarriage of the races in Hawaii and offered a rather complete social analysis of its variation and growth. His analysis of divorce was also sociologically well founded with respect to differences in the rates according to race. However, at that time only the race of the libellee was available for Hawaii as a whole; and only from a study of Honolulu was he able to disclose how racial in-marriages and outmarriages differed in divorce rate--with out-marriages having the higher rate, but not for all racial groups (Adams, 1937, pp. 214, 222). Twenty years later, utilizing published statistics, Cheng and Yamamura made a further detailed analysis of interracial marriage and divorce, and other population characteristics of the Hawaiians. In this case they were able to indicate for all of Hawaii the differential distribution of divorce according to type of racial mixture, again with racially endogamous marriages showing a lower rate than the out-married, but not uniformly so for all races (Cheng and Yamamura, 1957). Of recent data Robert Schmitt has inquired into additional aspects of Hawaiian interracial marriage, and Andrew Lind has reexamined the interracial divorce question (Lind, 1964; Schmitt, 1963, 1964).
DATA AND ANALYSIS
Classification
The identification of persons by one "race" or another, in an area where amalgamation is considerable and has been going on for some time, is undoubtedly

somewhat arbitrary. Published statistics do not show mixed-race persons, except for part-Hawaiians. The intermarriage of part-Hawaiians with part-Hawaiians of different ancestries, and even paired Japanese of mixed ancestries, etc., might in some instances be considered intermarriages. Hence, marriage and even population statistics that mask mixedrace persons undoubtedly understate the amount of amalgamation that has been and is taking place. The Vital Statistics Division of the Hawaii Health Department uses great care in its data classification; but as a recent report pointedly remarked, there is increasing difficulty in racial classification due to the extensive amalgamation, and such classification may soon become impossible. Incidental irregularities sometimes appear from one year to another in the published marriage and divorce statistics on race of husband by race of wife. In view of all this, any conclusions derived from these data should be regarded with considerable caution; but it is still believed that the errors are not so great but that conclusions of value can be drawn. Certainly, basic shifts in statistical averages can hardly be attributed to data classification.
Marriage
Utilizing the published statistics for Hawaii, the distribution of interracial marriage was charted for the 7-year period 1956 to 1962. Because race-by-race selectivity depends on a variety of circumstances requiring an intimate knowledge of Hawaiian social structure and customs not available to the writer, this background can be only acknowledged in this article. In evaluating the percentage figures shown (Table 1), the method of calculation and the difference in the relative size of each group should be noted (Besancency, 1965).

The extent of intermarriage is considerable, being 37%. Even if one counted Hawaiian with part-Hawaiian marriages as in-marriages, the overall figure remains at a high of 35%. This figure represents an additional increase over the ones reported by Adams: 15% mixed in 1912-- 1916, and 28% mixed in the 1930's (Adams, 1937, pp. 15-17, 20-21, 24, 214, 334, 336-347). This increase was participated in to some extent by all groups delineated in the several periods to date (Cheng and Yamamura, 1957; Lind, 1938, pp. 305, 308; Lind, 1964). The outmarriage rates of the Japanese, Korean, and Filipino women have increased remarkably since the pre-1930's.
Undoubtedly, the pure-Hawaiian class shows the highest out-marriage proportion, reaching 85% for the females; but it should be noted that 68% of the men married part-Hawaiians, and 40% of the women did so. The prediction by Adams (1937, p. 25) that as a pure racial group the Hawaiian is "destined to disappear at a comparatively early date" seems about fulfilled. The Spanish group, which had an 80-90% out-marriage rate in 1930-1934, is no longer delineated. The lowest figure for out-marriage was registered by the Japanese men (12.3%),

although Negro and Caucasian women were even more endogamous than were the Japanese women (17.6%, 19.4%, and 23.0%, respectively).
In interpreting the widely ranging proportions, the same circumstances offered in explanation by other analysts still appear correct: the sex ratio, the relative size of the group, residential location and concentration, occupational position, and the strength of cultural ties of each group (Adams, 1937, pp. 23, 28, 46, 142; Cheng and Yamamura, 1957, pp. 79-82; Lind, 1938, pp. 305, 308; Lind, 1964; Schmitt, 1963, 1964). There are variations, however. The Negro group represents a military situation with a male-female sex ratio of 221 in 1960, explaining the high out-marriage of the males and the low out-marriage of the females.1 The Filipino sex ratio of 179 would also explain in part the high male out-marriage rate, except that the Filipino females exceed the prevailing intermarriage rate. The sex ratio has some relevance to the low (19%) out-marriage proportion for Caucasian females; while small group size would help to explain the high Korean and Puerto Rican figures. About half of the Chinese males married Japanese women, but Chinese females married more widely into other groups. More Chinese and Japanese women paired with Caucasian men than did Caucasian women with Chinese and Japanese men.
The two Oriental groups, Japanese and Chinese, whose strong familism and cultural cohesion were remarked upon by Adams, once had a low out-marriage rate. Of all the groups their sex ratio

is near the normal at present, being 98 and 105, respectively. Yet, today, in the Hawaiian context, only the Japanese men are strongly endogamous (88% inmarried), and the Japanese women moderately so (77%); whereas the Chinese men and Chinese women show higherthan-average out-marriages (50% and 51%, respectively). It would seem that the sex ratio and cultural background should have produced a greater endogamy for the Chinese. While immersion of a small group in a larger culture might contribute to intermarriage, this factor does not hold in the continental United States where Chinese and Japanese endogamy prevails in spite of their numerical minority. Notwithstanding the shortage of Filipino women to Filipino men and their larger proportion in the total population, out-marriages are relatively less frequent for them than for Chinese women. Sex ratio, size of group, and cultural disparity, obviously, are only a part of the picture.
Divorce
In order to update our knowledge of the interracial divorce pattern in a more complete way, the divorces granted in the five-year period 1958-1962 were divided by marriages contracted in the preceding seven-year period 1956-1962. This is an acceptable procedure, used by several analysts, and the only one applicable to the published data. A different method of calculation would have yielded other ratios, but it is probable that the results obtained represent the approximate relative standing of each group.2 Analytical "controls" for inter-

o£ divorces was taken as a more representative set of divorces by race. The median marriage duration of Hawaii divorces is about seven years, and, in a sense, a longer base period for marriages--say 10 years--might have been taken. But since any method is arbitrary, and since

race comparisons were not possible from the data at hand, and remarriages are unavoidably included. Admittedly, this method does not purport to measure the exact proportion who will ultimately get a divorce. But if we regard the overall rate of 19.3% to be about the proportion of first marriages that end in divorce, then the ratios presented in this article might in a very rough sense be regarded as approximating the likelihood of the various marriage combinations to end in divorce.
The divorce rate for Hawaii was once higher than that for continental United States, but in recent decades the two rates have been rather similar. With social adjustments and general social stability coming to Hawaii, as Romanzo Adams predicted, the divorce rate has eased off. Reflecting their changing social condition, the major racial groups have also changed their relative divorce position over the years. Insofar as the other studies are comparable, the Japanese retain their exceptionally low ratio; the Chinese ratio (while low) has increased; but the part-Hawaiian ratio has decreased (Adams, 1937, pp. 211, 214, 215).
The mosaic of divorce ratios for the various racial groups and combinations, shown for the first time in this particular manner, reveals numerous variations. The explanation of these variations can be only hinted at, especially in the absence of other information on marital antecedents, occupation, religion, educational and class position, and other characteristics of the couples.
there have been no recent marked changes in the overall divorce rate or in the racial distribution of marriages, the shorter span was chosen. By so doing, the Negro group was also available from the published tables. Three sets of ratios were calculated with quite similar results: for the divorce/marriage periods 1958-1962 and 1956-1962, in addition to the one used in this article.

when organized groups intermarry with disorganized groups, the organized group will lower the divorce rate of the disorganized group to some extent, and vice versa.

tendency to divorce than either alone. In fact, Japanese husbands with Chinese wives have the lowest ratio of any combination (8.4). Interracial marriage in this instance cannot be said to contribute to divorce outcome.
Divorce ratios of cross-race compared to same-race marriages do not follow any one pattern but seem to depend on the kind of combination. Marriage of a Caucasian with a Chinese hardly reduces the ratio at all below the pure-Caucasian figure. Nor does the marriage of a Caucasian man with a Japanese woman present any additional divorce hazard, but for Japanese husbands taking Caucasian wives there is an opposite effect with the ratio mounting 50% above that for bothCaucasian marriages, and almost 150% above that for the pure-Japanese marriages. From the Caucasian viewpoint it is also apparent that the marriage of a Caucasian man to a part-Hawaiian reduces the ratio, but there is hardly any reduction for Caucasian wives who are married to part-Hawaiians. In mixed marriages the Caucasian husband, but not Caucasian wife, seems to have a stabilizing effect. Negro men marrying across racial lines do not thereby show any greater marital instability.
The high-ratio groups show another kind of relationship: out-marriage improves their marriage stability. But even here it depends upon which races intermarry. Filipinos intermarrying with Japanese, Chinese, or part-Hawaiians show decided betterment of their situation (for both males and females), but for the other groups only the females show a decline below the pure-Filipino rate. The Filipino man marrying a pureHawaiian has an even higher divorce expectancy than when he marries a Filipino woman.

CONCLUSION
These data for the State of Hawaii should indicate how extensive interracial marriage could become under conditions of social equality and freedom of the races, far different from the present situation in the continental United States.
As to the stability of intermarriage by race, in some cases the ratio tends to be one that stands in between that of the races individually considered, but in other cases the intermarriage divorce ratio exceeds that of the higher one. Again, in some cases but not in all, men intermarrying with another race have an advantage over women marrying within these same races. The pattern is extremely varied. As Romanzo Adams (1937) has competently pointed out, some explanation for differential divorce rates may be sought in the extent of intermarriage of each race,8 the conditions of freedom or loose social control that intermarriage betokens, and such factors as an imbalanced sex ratio and social disorganization; yet it should be apparent that the explanation lies, not in biological-racial factors, but in the cultural condition and customs of each group. As these Hawaiian data illustrate, whatever the explanation, interracial marriage does not necessarily lead to a weakening of family ties. Hence, exception must be taken to the recent statement of one researcher that interracial marriages are nearly three times less likely to succeed than ordinary marriages (Gordon, 1964, p. 348).
In spite of the considerable increase in interracial marriage in Hawaii, the divorce rate has stabilized at a level lower than in previous decades; and as a whole the mixed-race marriages are

Chinese and their low divorce rate is a major exception to this point.
