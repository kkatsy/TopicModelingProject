GOUT AND HYPERURIGEMIA IN A PACIFIC POPULATION GROUP*

G ARTHRITIS, a disease with a long
and honorable history, is characterized by violent episodes of acute, monarticular arthritis, by a ready response of that arthritis to colchicine (a drug which has no effect on other joint pains), and by an elevated serum uric acid. It is predominantly--about 90%--a disease of males. It is said to be more common among the intellectually brilliant.
The two characteristic features of gout --paroxysmal arthritis and hyperuricemia--are statistically linked but their exact relationship is unknown. Hyperuricema can be produced in several ways as has been stressed recently (1) . Some patients seem to synthesize increased amounts of uric acid while others, synthesizing an average amount, are unable to excrete it normally.
The familial nature of gout has long been recognized. Hyperuricema has been shown in as high as 25% of the first degree relatives of gouty proposai (2). The exact mode of inheritance has not been established. Some argue that hy-

peruricemia is the result of the combined, small effects of many genes while others maintain that a single gene controls the trait (2, 3).
Since it is likely that hyperuricema can be produced by different mechanisms, different patterns of inheritance may ultimately be found.
Until recently no data have been available on uric acid levels in Pacific Rim populations. Indeed, there have been no population data from any race or region. Several writers have, in the past, implied that hyperuricemia was rare in the Orient but this can be no longer maintained.
The work of Fisher (4) and Steuermann (5) in Hawaii and of our own group (6) have established beyond doubt that hyperuricemia is common in Filipino people under certain circumstances. Lennane and collaborators have noted similar findings in the Maori people of New Zealand (7) and many years ago Das Gupta commented upon the frequency with which he saw gout in the Hindu people of Nepal (8).

The investigational work here reported was done in association with Drs. James J. Lane, Jr., and William E. Reynolds and was supported by USPHS Grants 2A-5157 and A2663.

Our own interest in the population aspects of the problem was stimulated by the appearance in Seattle of several Filipino men with acute gouty arthritis. Filipinos are a small segment of the popula-

tion in the Pacific Northwest and gout is much less common than several other diseases. The juxtaposition of the two seemed beyond the realm of chance.
We conducted a survey of hospitaldischarges in Seattle (Fig.1) recording the races of all males with acute gouty arthritis andcompared this to the racial origins of all males admitted to the hospital (9). Identical diagnostic criteria were used for both groups. The results were startling in that Filipino males were admitted to the hospital with gout almost 20 times as frequently as non-Filipinos. The type of disease, whether with urate tophi or not,ageof onset, and degree of renal damage appeared similar in both groups. There was no particular region of the Philippine Islands represented in undue proportions.
These clinical findings suggested that hyperuricemia might be still more common in a group of normal Filipinomen as compared to a group of Caucasians. Arrangements were made to carry outa survey of a group of Filipino men working in theAlaska salmon canning industry and an age matched group of Caucasian federal penitentiary prisoners. In both cases completion rates of slightly over 90% were achieved andthus we believe the results are free of the bias occasionally introduced by using random volunteers for this kind of study.
Fasting early morning blood samples were obtained, blood pressures were measured and a questionnaire was completed on 113 Philippine Island born men whose parents were described as Filipinos andon88 Caucasians. All were 40 years of age or older. The serum uric acids were determined by the ultraviolet spectrophotometric method (10).

on healthy Scandinavian men and on U.S. Army inductees. Despite the wide age differences, the mean serum uric acids were identical. This finding tends to confirm thenotion that, after puberty, there is no change in the serum uric acid value withage.
The Filipino group (Fig.3) showed very definite hyperuricemia. Their mean serum uric acid was 1.3 mg.% greater than that of the Caucasians, a difference which is far beyond chance expectation.
Twenty-three Filipinos reported on their questionnaire that they hadhad episodes of severe joint pain (Fig. 4). These 23 individuals had a significantly greater mean serum uric acid level than those who gave no history of arthralgias.

Figure 4. The non-drug Filipino and Caucasian subjects (bottom line) differed by 1.2 mg. per 100 m. ± S.E.M. 0.18, a highly significant figure.

No such relationship held for the Caucasians. This finding is consistent with our initial hospital survey in suggesting that gout is more frequent in Filipinos.
At the bottom of the figure are data based on the question "Have you taken any medicines, such as aspirin, in the last three days?" Many medications including acetylsalicylic acid are known to modify uric acid excretion and, correspondingly, its blood level. We were trying to assure ourselves that the elevation was not due solely to drugs. As can be seen, the Filipino drug users had a significant elevation of their mean serum uric acid while the Caucasian drug users tended to have reduced values. Since the same types of patent medicines were being taken by both groups, we concluded that, in the amounts used, the

drugs per se had little effect on the uric acid level. In any case, confining our comparison exclusively to men whowere taking no drugs whatsoever (the bottom line), highly significant hyperuricemia among Filipinos was again noted.
One of the most interesting features of this problem lies in the fact that reports of Filipino hyperuricemia and gout have come from Hawaii and Seattle but not from the Philippines. In the Seattle environment it is possible to compare different population groups living side by side; differences are thus more easily discriminated, an epidemiologic tool of the greatest importance, and this comparison may explain the apparent discrepancies in the literature. It also raises the question of whether or not an environmental change secondary to moving across the ocean could conceivably induce the disease.
A number of environmental factors could not be controlled in our study, the most notable being the diets of thetwo groups. The diets were carefully evaluated and the Filipinos were not eating substantially more purine-containing foods. However, very small amounts of some medicináis can effect the renal tubules and produce hyperuricemia; itwas thought possible that condiments or other quantitatively minor portions of the Filipino diet might cause uric acid retention.
Accordingly, four hyperuricemic Filipino men were admitted to the hospital and were given a standard hospital diet without special foods. No difference in their serum values was detected whether they were on a self-chosen home diet or on the hospital food. Further, we have had the opportunity to check the serum uric acid levels of 50 Japanese seamen eating a shipboard diet with many elements common to the Filipino diet

(such asusing rice as theprincipal carbohydrate source). The mean serum uric acid value ofthe Japanese was 5.1 mg.%, a value indistinguishable from that of the Caucasian control series. We have tentatively concluded that the hyperuricemia is notdue to diet or other environmental phenomena.

In a genetically stable population a trait controlled by the combined small effects of many genes, such as height, should show a symmetrical frequency distribution curve. The suggestively bimodal curve noted in these studies and the successful dissection raise again the possibility of control by a single gene and the large proportion of the population (22%) in the hyperuricemic group strongly indicates the existence of a polymorphism. Regardless of the exact mode of inheritance, however, the findings require that selective factors, operating in the Philippine Islands but not in Western societies, be invoked to explain the hyperuricemia. A better understanding of these selective factors may lead to a better understanding of the nature of the disease.
In summary it can be said,
1. That a high incidence of gout and hyperuricemia has been shown to exist in certain limited Filipino populations,
2. That there is substantial evidence suggesting that this is not an environmental phenomenon but rather an inherited trait,
3. That the serum uric acid frequency distribution curve favors a single gene hypothesis of inheritance which, in turn,

implies the existence of a genetic poly-
morphism.
