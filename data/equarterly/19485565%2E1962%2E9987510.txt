CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS ATTRIBUTED TO SLEEPING PILL (THALIDOMIDE)
LISSY F. JARVIK
New York State Psychiatric Institute

IN RECENT MONTHS several reports ap-
peared in European literature linking a number of major congenital malformations to the maternal ingestion of thalidomide during the first trimester of pregnancy. Introduced in 1958, this drug was widely used as a sedative in general office practice as well as in the management of psychiatric patients. Furthermore, thalidomide was prescribed frequently for obstetrical patients because of its safety (no known toxic dose) and its effectiveness in inducing nightly sleep and controlling the nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. The popularity of this drug was reflected in the number of trade names under which thalidomide (N-phthalyl glutamic acid imide) and compounds containing it were marketed abroad. Distaval, Valgis, Valgraine, Asmaval, Tensival, Contergan, Softenon, Neurosedyn, Isomin, Kedavon, Telargan and Sedalis were some of the proprietary designations.
Toward the end of 1961, German investigators (Lenz, Kosenow, Pfeiffer, and Wiedemann) implicated thalidomide in the production of major congenital anomalies. Hence, the drug was withdrawn from the German market as of November 27, 1961.
The first reference to the untoward effects of thalidomide in British literature was contained in a note from the

managing director of the company marketing the compound. The letter was published in Lancet on December 2, 1961, and announced the withdrawal of the drug (Hayman, 1961). In the very next issue of Lancet, a report from Australia (McBride, 1961) described an increased incidence of congenital malformations in offspring of mothers who had taken thalidomide during pregnancy. Similar observataions were published by Lenz, Pfeiffer and Kosenow; Burley, Speirs, Kohler, et al.; Willman and Dumoulin; Russell and McKichan; Devitt and Kenny; and Morgan. The consensus as to symptomatology was that the extremities, particularly upper limbs, were invariably affected, usually in a symmetrical manner and with an equal distribution between the sexes. The most striking abnormality was failure of the development of the long bones, although absence of digits, polydactyly and syndactyly, was also seen. Furthermore, there were birthmarks (capillary hemangiomata) of the nose and upper lip as well as absence of the external ears and the eyes. Abnormalities of the gastro-intestinal tract were fairly frequent, with cardiac anomalies occurring less often. The nervous system, skull and spine apparently were spared. While the present evidence linking thalidomide to these de-

formities is purely circumstantial, it rests upon the following considerations:
1. A significant increase in the frequency of these congenital abnormalities after the introduction of thalidomide. According to McBride, for example, the frequency rose from the usual rate of 1.5% to 20% in infants of women who had taken thalidomide during pregnancy (cf. Lenz, 1962; Watson et al., 1961).
2. A positive history of thalidomide administration in a very high proportion of the mothers of affected infants. The exact percentage is under dispute (Lenz, 1962; Burley, 1962), but Speirs was recently able to verify that prescriptions for this drug were filled during early pregnancy for eight of the ten mothers of affected infants born in his locale between January 1961 and January 1962.
3. A high degree of overall similarity of the malformations observed in Germany, Australia, Great Britain, Belgium, Sweden and Switzerland, although there was individual variability.
4. Lack of a more plausible explanation.
Though circumstantial, the evidence presented is impressive.
Regardless of the fact that thalidomide was never marketed in the United States, the given observations are of interest to human geneticists in this country for a number of reasons. Should an etiologic relationship be demonstrated, it might provide another example of drug-induced congenital malformation. Studies are now in progress, in which attempts are made to duplicate the effect in animals (Burley, 1962).
It may be noted that most mothers (80% or more) delivered normal infants despite the administration, of thalidomide during the critical period in pregnancy. As would be expected from our lack of information concerning the mech-

anism of action, the reasons for individual differences in response to the drug are unknown. Thus, genetic factors may be of importance in predisposing mother or infant to the adverse effects of this compound. Examination of the karyotypes of 14 affected children failed to reveal any chromosomal abnormality (Pfeiffer and Kosenow, 1962).
No reports are as yet available concerning the incidence of congenital anomalies in children of relatives who had taken thalidomide during pregnancy. According to Pfeiffer and Kosenow, there was neither an increased incidence of congenital anomalies in the family histories of their series of affected infants, nor consanguinity among the parents. Interesting enough, a Brazilian research team (Freire-Maia) failed to confirm the genetic hypothesis in a study of 15 cases assumed to exhibit recessively inherited multiple bone aplasias and hypoplasias. The investigators did not mention in their letter whether thalidomide had been administered during pregnancy. If so, the abnormalities might be considered examples of phenocopies.
Investigation of the manner in which thalidomide produces certain anomalies may shed some light upon the field of congenital abnormalities. Isolated case reports of the development of myxedema and neuropathy, and at times a combination of both, may provide valuable clues for further research in this area (Alexander, 1961; Fullerton and Kremer, 1961; Lillicarp, 1962; Raffauf, 1961; Robertson, 1962; Scheid et al., 1961; and Simpson, 1962).
Lenz estimates that in Western Germany alone, 2000-3000 infants have been affected since 1959. Regardless of the role ultimately assigned to thalidomide, this calamity indicates a need for examining routinely the possible teratogenic
