INTRODUCTION
Hereditary differences between races or populations provide one o£ the best fields for studying human evolution, not only of the past but current, with implications for the future.
The present endeavor was prompted by reports of lower prevalence rates of defective distance vision among certain populations living until recent times in hunting or food-collecting cultures (habitats) as compared with Europeans. Such observations are frequent in anthropological literature of the past. While never disproved, they have rarely been examined critically. The alleged difference cuts across conventional racial lines, separating the species into two contrasted types--"unsullied wildmen" and "degenerate civilized." Such adjectives as these started a chain reaction of emotional speculation some decades ago which has obscured the situation, even though they may be based upon a quite plausible hypothesis--that of relaxed selection.
In spite of the many difficulties inherent in the study of functional traits, two important observations give encouragement to the consideration of distance acuity: a) most departures from the modal, i.e., the optimal standard of acuity for any population sample are associated with spherical refraction aberration (myopia or "nearsightedness," and hyperopia or "farsightedness"); b) these have a marked genetic basis. In the present review it is proposed 1) to outline

this basis, after noting briefly some race differences in defects not involving refraction; 2) to summarize a few reports which show measurable differences in the frequencies of refractive aberrations between samples of various populations; and 3) to raise the question of the phenomenon of selection relaxation as an explanation of the higher frequencies of defective vision among populations with long histories of agriculture and/or permanent settlement.
DEFECTS NOT DUE TO REFRACTION
Vision defects which are not due to obviously extraneous or environmental factors such as nervousness, inattention, poor cooperation, accident, and contagious or infectious disease may be roughly divided into a larger category of refraction aberrations and a smaller category of the more serious defects. The second category contains a long list of abnormalities, some not well understood and others which have been investigated for decades and contain among them a number of nosological entities which are under simple, i.e., monomeric, genetic control. Each is of rare occurrence, since its very severity limits or even prevents reproduction. While the cause of racial differentiation is not known, in the case of a rare, serious defect one may easily suspect that it depends on differential mutation rate when no variation in environment or selection force is conceivable. Five of the genetically controlled

traits exhibiting race differences are mentioned briefly.
Oguchi's Disease, or congenital night blindness, a form of hemeralopia congenita, is perhaps the best known. Most of the cases so far reported have occurred among Japanese. (Mann, 1957, p. 149). There may be several forms or types, each with a distinct genetic basis, but the principal authors believe it is always inherited as an autosomal recessive (Kawakami, 1924; Oguchi, 1926; Komai, 1934).
Lebefs Optic Nerve Atrophy also has been reported more frequently in Japan than elsewhere. Komai (1934, p. 15) writes: ". . . of all the hereditary diseases of the eye which cause blindness, this is the commonest among the Japanese." There are various forms, similar clinically but distinguishable by their manners of inheritance (Kawakami, 1926; Hogben, 1932). Relative frequencies among females in Japanese pedigrees are reported to be considerably greater than in European pedigrees (Imai, 1936; Waardenburg, 1935), which suggests that the two races may have distinct forms of the disease. This suspicion is strengthened by differences in onset ages--a single peak at 15 in Japan; two peaks, one of 15 and another between ages 20 and 43, among Europeans (Bell, 1928). These differences may be due to race differences in genetic background.
Phimosis of the palpebral opening with unusually large intercanthal width is almost unknown except in the Mongolian race, where it is not uncommon. Komoto (1920) has pointed out that it "is due to the excessive development of the connective tissue in the circumorbital muscle. Both the upper and lower lids are thickened and hardened, and they can only with great difficulty be turned back. It is transmitted as a clear Mendelian simple dominant character"

(Komai, 1934, pp. 9, 10). Spielmeyer-Vogt's Disease or juvenile
amaurotic familial idiocy, characterized by pigmentary retinal lipoid neuronal degeneration leading to blindness and death usually at ages 5 to 10, with autosomal recessive inheritance, appears to be more frequent among Scandinavians than other Europeans (Gilje, 1957; Sjogren, 1930-1931, p. 416). It is not unknown in Japan (Komai, 1934, 1947).
Tay-Sach's Disease or infantile amaurotic idiocy, another type of retinal degeneration controlled by a recessive autosomal gene, was first described in Jewish families and for some time was unknown among Gentiles but is now believed widespread in European populations. The gene frequency has been estimated in the United States among Jews at 0.01, among European Gentiles at 0.0015 (Kozinn et al., 1957). Estimates among Japanese of 0.0007 to 0.0034 and among Caucasians of 0.0006 to 0.0018 are reported (Neel et al., 1949).
HERITABILITY OF VARIATION IN
SPHERICAL REFRACTION
A number of theories of the etiology of aberrant refraction have been developed, each with a voluminous literature, of which heredity is but one. Pedigree analyses have produced controversial results which suggest that several monomeric genes may be involved --one or more perhaps acting as autosomal recessives and one or more perhaps as autosomal dominants, while in many families with several myopic members the hereditary mechanism seems to be polygenic. Most pedigrees give no clear indication of Mendelian unit traits, even though they may contain numbers of myopes, hyperopes, or both.
That heritability is high has been evidenced in three fields. Monozygotic

(MZ) twin pairs resemble each other to a far greater degree than dizygotic (DZ) twins in all degrees of refraction, the more so in proportion as the lower degrees of inter-pair differences are considered as constituting "no difference." Even when the degrees of difference of over one diopter are eliminated, the greater resemblance of MZ as contrasted with DZ twin pairs is very high (Table 1). Second, deficiencies of vision are very much more frequent among children of first cousins than among children whose parents are not related. The effects of

consanguineous marriage may be greater for ocular deficiencies (which include but are not limited to spherical refraction aberrations) than for any other class of abnormality investigated in a large comprehensive study of consanguinity in Japan (Miller, 1961, p. 120). Third, analysis of race differences provides evidence of heritability, as it is hoped may be demonstrated in this paper.
That the mechanism of heredity is not simple detracts in no way from its overall importance, however complicated it may be to investigate. No function may

prove to be more complicated than that of vision, in man or any organism, involving as it does the highest degree of coordination of many different parts under continuously changing circumstances --muscles both striped and smooth, nerves both central and peripheral, tissues of the greatest degree of specialization. To conclude that the form of inheritance of spherical refraction variation is usually polygenic should neither surprise nor disappoint. Polygenic systems permit greater degrees of buffering and finer adjustments. They offer a particular challenge to the pioneer investigator.
The pattern of variation is not simple. The frequency distribution of an unselected sample, ranging from highest negative diopters of myopia on the left through zero refraction (emmetropia) to highest positive diopters of hyperopia on the right, is quite different from the normal curve. It is decidedly leptokurtic with an exceedingly large modal class, long thin tails, and a mean which is invariably on the hyperopic side of emmetropia. Spherical refraction distribution is rarely symmetrical at any level, the tail of the curve for myopes being usually considerably larger in both length and thickness, although not dissimilar in proportions, compared with the tail for hyperopes, while in the body of the curve near the mode the hyperopes usually outnumber the myopes. The shape, symmetry, and positions of mean and median with respect to the zero point vary in different populations, particularly with respect to age.
Sex differences have been intensively investigated by Hirsch (1953) who refracted 2,574 men and 2,627 women. Among myopes of over --6 D he found about twice as many women as men, whereas among lower grades men out-

numbered women about 10 to 8. The higher category comprised only 1.5% of the myopia cases, the lower category 98.5%. He suggests that there may be two types of myopia, distinguished by the degree of dioptric aberrance, namely, a "high" (termed "degenerative" or "congenital") and "low" (tentatively attributed to "physiological or biological variation"). This study supports the classical view that high myopia is more frequent in women and low myopia in men. Less careful population studies usually indicate higher frequencies of both myopia and hyperopia in males than in females at all ages, but with greater differences among adults than children, and at all levels of dioptric aberrance. To what degrees these sex differences are genetic or environmental is unknown.
Among twins, higher concordance rates of monozygotic as contrasted with dizygotic pairs have been reported for numerous optic traits by several dozens of authors. A long bibliography is cited by Waardenburg (1950, p. 187). Several authors have published observations on collections of twins. Thus Holste (1941) reports refractions of 120 MZ and 120 DZ twins. Discordance is found in 9 of the 60 MZ pairs and in 27 of the DZ pairs. The 51 concordant MZ pairs consist of 29 emmetropic, 15 myopic, and 7 hyperopic; the 33 concordant DZ pairs are 28 emmetropic, 2 myopic, and 3 hyperopic. Nakajima (1962) found discordance for myopia in only 3 of 14 pairs of MZ twins and in his one pair of DZ twins in a preliminary study.
Five authors have published refractions in diopters which show the differences between the matched eyes of twin pairs at various ages (Huber, 1931; Jablonski, 1922; Jancke, 1941; van Roth, 1937; Waardenburg, 1930, 1950). Their results are pooled in Table 1 for 596 MZ

and 467 DZ pairs, combining positive refractions with negatives (hyperopes with myopes). An excess of smaller differences between MZ pairs compared with DZ is noted (77% vs. 56% <3/4 D), together with a deficiency of greater differences (23% vs. 44% ^ 3/4 D). This excess is marked at whatever level of "difference" one may select. Thus, defining matched eye differences of 1/2 D and over as "different" (and of 1/4 as "not different"), chi square for heterogeneity is 33, with p miniscule. With higher definitions of "different" the chi square values are also higher. Since the differences between dizygotic pairs usually increase with age as compared with monozygotic, these results might not be as great for children.
Since the degrees of aberration in spherical refraction as measured in diopters are not of equal magnitude, the variation is not continuous, and therefore no correlations can be made in refraction differences between twin pairs. Were such correlations possible, an estimate of heritability might be made. Two estimates of the prevailing range of interpair differences caused by environmental variation are reported, however, both based upon studies of European twins, namely, 2 D (Jablonski, 1922, p. 314) and 2i/4 D (Waardenburg, 1930, p. 614).
The second method of estimating the force of heredity is by analysis of the rates of vision defects among the offspring of parents of various degrees of consanguinity. In an impressive study of Japanese children in Hiroshima and Nagasaki ascertained through their mothers during pregnancy (when they were entitled to supplementary rice rations), the rates of vision defects were compared among four classes, namely, children whose parents were (a) first cousins, (b) first cousins once removed,

or ly2 cousins, (c) second cousins, and (d) unrelated (Miller, 1961). The results give strong evidence for the role of vision deficiency-producing "recessive genes," in so far as homozygosity at all loci is increased among the offspring of related parents. Congenital organic lesions of the eye associated with vision deficiency of 20/70 Snellen or worse are at the following rates among classes a-d, respectively: 0.0100, 0.0032, 0.0028, and 0.0017 (Miller, 1961, Table 4). Rates in other categories give similar results, i.e., congenital blindness, 0.0039,--, 0.0014, and 0.0006; acuity of 20/70 or worse not due to organic lesions, 0.08356, 0.0736, 0.056, and 0.06446; acuity of 20/40-50 not due to organic lesions, 0.06098,0.0544, 0.04647, and 0.04325. Other comparisons are made between only two classes: congenital Nystagmus associated with Snellen score 20/70 or worse, 0.0027 (a) and 0.0014 (c); frequency of visual acuity of 20/70 or worse, not due to organic disease and not correctable by minus spherical lenses, .0184 (a) and .0116 (c) (Miller, 1961, Tables 4, 5, 6, 11, 15, and 19). These results are all highly significant statistically. Miller also made careful comparisons between the four classes of children for a number of factors including month of birth, birth weight, present height and weight, mother's pregnancy history, child's organic disease not involving the eye, dental caries, blood pressure, neurological test scores, handedness, and also environmental factors such as economic and sociological status, food costs, father's educational history and school attendance. He states in summary: "The data indicated that the prevalence of these defects (in distant visual acuity) was influenced by heredity and by the events during or just after gestation. Under the conditions of this survey, however, no association was

A summary of the results of examinations and tests of children of two classes, a and c, is given in Table 2. Miller's report is the most complete and detailed, with the broadest sampling, of any population study of eye defects in the literature.
Preliminary results of studies by Nakajima (1962) in Japan appear to be indicating similar conclusions.
VISION DEFECTS IN OLDEST CIVILIZATIONS
Chinese and Japanese A number of authors have been im-
pressed by the high frequency of myopia in China and Japan, in contrast with Europe and particularly with other areas of the Far East which are close geographically to China and Japan but which have shorter histories of agriculture

(Holm, 1937, p. 55; Skeller, 1945, p. 189; Ts-tswang, 1921; Li, 1920).
One of the most thoroughgoing and convincing authors (Rasmussen, 1936) investigated the lenses manufactured in some 25 Chinese refraction centers serving over 100,000 persons, from which he makes estimates of very high rates of myopia. He summarizes several works written in ancient Chinese which discuss the wide prevalence of myopia, and comments (pp. 358-360): "Whatever the predisposing causes of this high incidence of myopia, one fact is certain: that it is widespread among all classes of Chinese, and, in view of the prevailing illiteracy . . . among 98 per cent of the people, that it must have taken many generations to bring about." He attributes myopia to heredity rather than to the direct result of "close work" (i.e., reading and writing) but he speculatively explains this Chinese inheritance in terms of Lamarck rather than of Darwin.

Note: "Deficiency" in the Caucasian cases is 3/10 or worse (data from Collins, 1924, Table 2); in Japanese cases 20/70 or worse (data from Miller, 1961, Table 46, page 107). The two standards are considered to be sufficiently similar to warrant a comparison between these samples of the two races provided that the differences are regarded with caution.

and 500 "oriental" soldiers of the U. S. Army, all born and schooled in Hawaii, may be noted briefly even though they were patients and therefore not randomly drawn samples of the two "races" (Braveman, 1952). Hyperopia was more frequent among the Caucasians at all dioptric levels, myopia more frequent among the "orientals" at high levels but approximately equal in frequency at low levels. The average refractions were --1.84 D for "orientals" and --0.99 D for Caucasians. There was no difference in cylindric refraction (astigmatism).
Miller (1961, pp. 106-107, Table 46) presents data for distance acuity as estimated from Snellen tests ("twenty" system) for six age-groups of children from Hiroshima and Nagasaki whose parents are not related, together with American data reported by Collins (1924). Organic lesions of the eye are included in both series. The results (Table 3) suggest markedly higher rates of "deficiency" at each age level among the Japanese, but Miller hesitates to conclude that these differences are due to race, properly

pointing out that "dissimilar survey techniques . . . make comparison of the observations of different investigators most unsatisfactory."
Refraction studies of a sample of Japanese and of Caucasian school children are summarized together in Table 4 and Figure 1. Both samples were selected at random, and the examinations were made under circumstances sufficiently similar to permit making this comparison, even though one group was in Japan and the other in California. The sample of Caucasians contains more hyperopes at every grade (intervals of 1 D) and fewer myopes at every grade but one (--1 D). Emmetropia is more frequent among the Japanese when this condition is denned as < ± 1 D , but the two samples have virtually equal frequencies of emmetropia when defined as < ±2D.

Conclusions: The Japanese in these samples

more frequently hyperopic at whatever dioptric

levels these two classes may be arbitrarily de-

fined. These differences are statistically signifi-

cant.

·Data from Majima, 1960, Table 3, and Blum et al., 1939, p. 86, respectively.

apparently without cycloplegia (Krusius, 1913), the two sets of data cannot be pooled.
The mean refractions in the paper of Krusius (1913) suggest that the Brahmins may be more myopic than the "untouchables" of the same region with whom they are compared, both samples being of pupils in the same Roman Catholic "Hochschule" (X = --0.30 and +0.01, respectively). But the difference between the medians is much less (--0.08 D and -{-0.01 D, respectively). Since this Brahmin series includes 13 cases of highmyopia (7 cases in excess of --10 D and 6 more cases from --6 D to --7y2 D), the median seems of more significance than the mean. In the study of Pendse (1954), the Brahmins and another caste show no over-all difference in mean refraction.
In both studies the Brahmins have a consistently lower rate of emmetropia, however broadly or narrowly emmetropia may be defined (Table 5).This is due to their having higher rates of bothmyopia and hyperopia at all levels of refraction than the non-Brahmins reported in the same study. Chi squares for these differences are high.
Egyptians
A number of studies are cited by Meyerhof (1914) reporting extraordinarily high frequencies of myopia among settled Egyptians, especially among Copts (Christians) but also among Muslims, in marked contrast with the low rates of groups until recently migratory or semimigratory in the deserts of southern Egypt, namely, Nubians, Bedouins, and Sudanese. Although all of the subjects examined were hospital patients and therefore not random representatives of their population, a high proportion was ascertained because of infection, chiefly conjunctivitis, which should not cause

198 Post

bias. Most of the settled folk were younger than the nomads.
While practicing ophthalmology in the Abbas Hospital in Cairo, Meyerhof (1914) was struck by the high frequency of myopes among illiterate Egyptians. Impressed with the great antiquity of

their civilization and believing that they afforded a good opportunity for testing etiological theories (including those of the direct effect or environment--i.e., "close work"-- and of the shape of the orbit), he collected data on the refractions of various "racial" groups passing

through the Hospital's outpatient service. Among 2,591 male and 1,107 female Egyptians he found 32% and 17%, respectively, to be myopic (1,686 Copts, 1,552 Muslims, 460 nomads). Among 750 male and 551 female Europeans he found 20% and 16%, respectively, to be myopic (principally southern Italians, Greeks, Maltese and Spanish Jews). Among 282 males and 265 females from the Middle East. (Syrians, Armenians and Turks), he found 22% and 10% myopic. He considered the higher rates of myopia among the Egyptians particularly significant, since they included large numbers

of illiterates, whereas the other two groups were all highly literate. Meyerhof considered that his results confirmed the observations of several earlier authors (whom he cites), based upon less exacting work, that Egyptians are more frequently myopic than Europeans.
His data for myopia show a marked correspondence between the rates of literates as compared with illiterates among both Copts and Muslims, each group having been recorded separately for men and for women (Table 6). This result seems acceptable, even though the sex differences among both Copts and Muslims are considerable. The latter might seem to reflect differences of environment, since in Cairo (as in many places) men use their eyes for close work considerably more than women. Meyerhof's failure to find a single myope among 178 Nubians, most of whom were literate, is also notable. Unfortunately, the refractions of Bedouins and Sudanese were not reported separately. However, Herrnheiser (1892) examined the refractions of Bedouins in his clinic at Prague and failed to find one myope among 32 adults, all of whom were devout readers of the Koran.

Jewish Populations
Reports of higher prevalence of defective vision among European Jews contrasted with Gentiles at all age levels have been frequent. While no study of the two groups is known in which the amount of daily "close work" has been equivalent, such as in the occupation of adults or the amount of reading at home of school children, nevertheless a number of studies appear to have been carefully made, and all of the results point in the same direction.
Most of the authors conclude that the principal vision defect which contrasts Jews from Gentiles is myopia. Some of them indicate that myopia is more frequent among males of both groups than among females; others indicate that intergroup differences are greater among males than females; still others indicate that myopia develops at earlier ages among Jews, noting that the rates increase more rapidly during later childhood among Gentiles and thus that intergroup differences have decreased slightly by the early teens. All of the authors who consider the question of etiology attribute the higher rates of defective vision found among Jews to heredity rather than to differences in living conditions or mode of life (Nicati, 1879; Kirchner, 1889; Stephenson, 1892; Botwinik, 1900; Gallus, 1922).
Pearson and Moul (1927, p. 114) reported myopia in 13.3% of 900 Jewish schoolboys in Aldgate, London, most of them children of immigrants, compared with 5.5% of 718 Scottish and 2.3% of 10,416 English schoolboys of the same ages tested under similar conditons. Astigmatism was found in higher frequencies among the Scots than among the Jews. Emmetropia was highest among the English.
Sourasky (1928) reported that 43.2%

of 1,649 Jewish boys ages 6 to 14 failed to pass a reading test for good vision (6/9 or better), whereas 21.7% of 600 Gentile boys failed the same test given under identical conditions in London schools. He notes that these results agree with the 1924 Report of the School Medical Officer for the London County Council, namely, that defectives (6/12 or worse) constituted 43.2% among the Jewish schoolboys, 20.9% among nonJewish. He writes that "the heavy incidence of defect among the Jewish boys is apparent from the very beginning of school life, at the age of 6, and is not very markedly less then, than towards the end of school life." (p. 200). From the fact that defective vision does not increase appreciably between ages 6 and 13 (his data are summarized here in Table 7), Sourasky concluded that it is "apparently not produced by the excessive amount of close work done by Jewish boys" (p. 211). "Comparative analysis of the refractive errors . . . reveals (a) but little (inter-group) difference in the distribution of errors, apart from a rather higher incidence of myopia and of low hypermetropia among the Jewish children. . . ."
Sorsby (1934, 1938, p. 394; 1951, p. 84) reported the refractions of 772 unselected Jewish and 672 non-Jewish school children in London (Figure 2). His comments merit quotation in full (1938, p. 396): "The paramount significance of heredity in the refractive states is well brought out by mass investigation of the refractive errors in childhood--i.e. before the effective onset of disturbing environmental factors--of different races. A case in point is the curve of frequency of the different refractive states in a series of Jewish and of Gentile children, aged four to eight. Following upon the finding that the incidence

of myopia in Jewish children in London at the school-leaving age is about double that of Gentile children, the refractive state of the two groups of children at the beginning of school life was determined (Figure 2). These curves of frequency during childhood bring out clearly the reason for the greater incidence of myopia in the adult Jewish population: the curve for Jewish children is decidedly flatter, i.e. the mode of refraction is on a lower hypermetropic level, and the whole curve is tilted towards the myopic side."

VISION DEFECTS AMONG PEASANT
CULTIVATORS
Ramos (1890, p. 57) reported refraction aberrations among 2,000 Mexican and 300 American Indian children of similar ages in the same schools, as follows: myopes, 4.4% and 0.3%, respectively; hyperopes, 3.0% and 0.6%; astigmatics, 0.5% and 0%; emmetropes, 92.1% and 99.1%. He used the same standards of examination for both races and describes the Mexicans as "mixed," presumably referring to Spanish ancestry. While he gives no description of the

Explanation in text. (From B. D. Karpinos, 1944, Human Biology, 16:13, with the kind permission of Dr. Karpinos and the publishers).

Indians, it seems safe to assume that they had a shorter history of agriculture and settled habitation than the Mexicans. Ramos adds that he had not found one case of myopia among some 2,000 adult "aborigines" whom he had treated in his ophthalmological practice, an experience shared by a colleague among 1,151 Indians.
Karpinos (1944) compared 1,000 American Negroes with 1,000 whites in visual acuity as scored by the Selective Service System in Snellen notations ("twenty" system). He found notably

more emmetropic eyes among the former at all levels of acuity in both of the standard age groups (18-24, 25-39) and writes in his summary (page 11) : "The difference between the two racial groups was somewhat larger in the older than in the younger age group, which may suggest that diminution in visual acuity with age is slower among colored than among white." He adds: "Whether the differences are due to racial (genetic) factors or to occupational or other social factors is a question that must be left open."

Since the average age of the younger group was 20.1 years among colored and 19.6 among whites, the latter had a slight advantage. In the older group both races averaged 30.6 years. Both races scored better in the younger age group. Details of the differences are shown in Figure 3.
This is the best study which has been found comparing American Negroes with whites in visual acuity. The 2,000 records were drawn at random from those of all selectees (drafted men) examined during the month of February, 1943, at the Joint Army and Navy induction centers of the (then) 48 states, including 2,567 colored and 21,139 whites. (These do not include the records of selectees rejected in preliminary examinations by the local draft boards, comprising .003 of the colored and .002 of the whites; nor of mental defectives; nor of illiterates; nor of inductees distributed to the Navy, which in February of 1943 received about 10% of the colored and about 23% of the whites) . The ascertainment of Karpinos' material was as unbiased and randomized as could be arranged.
Even though the differences in environment between American Negroes and whites are too great to permit the attribution of sample differences primarily to race, it is interesting to note the magnitude of these differences between the two races among the men drafted during World War II. Three categories of "Eye Defects" were reported separately for Negroes and "whites" (this term included all other races, such as American Indians). The published reports (Statistics: Periodic Reports of Physical Examination, Volumes 3 [Summary], and 15-25 [All Recorded Defects], November 1940-September 1945, National Headquarters, Selective Service System, U.S. Government) are actually photostats of typed sheets without page

numbers or marked subdivisions. Overall results of the examinations at Local Boards from November 1940 to September 1941 on 398,576 Negroes and 2,396,151 "whites" may be summarized as follows (Table 3 in section entitled "Eye Defects in Selective Service Registrants"):

In blindness and diseases of the eye there was no appreciable over-all difference between the races, although there was minor fluctuation among the rates of the diseases. In defective vision, however, the Negroes' rate was only about one fourth that of the whites. This ratio was approximated in each of the 48 states. To quote from the report (third of unnumbered pages in section "Eye Defects in Selective Service Registrants"): "Thus it appears that the visual acuity of physically examined Negroes is better than that of whites. This is confirmed quantitatively by a recent study of Snellen measurements of registrants examined at induction stations." (Reference is made here to the paper by Karpinos reviewed above).
Similar results were obtained from acuity tests of some 273,000 registrants for military service January 1957 through September 1958 (Karpinos,

1960). Of 51,282 Negroes and 221,310 "whites" (non-Negroes) examined, the test results of samples of about 50% of each group were randomly drawn for statistical analysis. Their average ages were 21.6 and 21.8 years, respectively. At every interval of the Snellen test the Negroes excelled, as shown by the following rates per 100 examinees passing the test:

Defects Among Populations of Hunters The principal concern of this review
is to examine the allegation that populations with long histories of agricultural economy and/or settled habitat have higher rates of vision defects than populations now or until comparatively re-

cently in a culture-habitat of hunters or food collectors. This is a somewhat different concept than the one reported so frequently in anthropological literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, that "savages have better eyesight than civilized peoples." The first concept is of a minority group of subnormals within a ("civilized") population, the modal group of which is not subnormal, while the second concept allegates rank inferiority to the mode, the mean, and a large proportion of the individuals. The second has been frequently denied, but the first has been fairly well substantiated by a number of studies, of which several have been mentioned above and two more will be summarized now.
The most outstanding studies known of vision defects in populations of hunters or collectors are those of Holm (1937) on Gabon Negroes in (formerly) French Equatorial Africa, and of Skeller (1954) on Eskimos in East Greenland. Both populations are considered "unmixed." Both samples were ascertained at random and include children and adults of both sexes. Examination of the fundus was made by ophthalmoscope after cycloplegia before refraction, which was recorded in diopters for each age. Both authors discuss their results at some length.
In order to contrast the frequencies of vision defects and of emmetropia with those in European samples, a summary of results is presented in Table 8 and Figure 4. Since two of the three European samples chosen are of young adult males, the samples of hunters are reduced in order to correspond as much as possible in sex and age distribution. The European samples are of Germans (Betsch, 1929, p. 372), Swedes (Stromberg, 1936, p. 288), and British (Sorsby,

1961, p. 1396). Holm's material was obtained from
the mission hospital of Dr. Albert Schweitzer at Lambare'n^ on the River Ogooue some 80 kilometers south of the equator. The "Gabons" of this region, also called "Palae-Negroids" and "forest Negroes," are considered most typical of the "pure" Negro. They are believed to have no history of agriculture or animal husbandry, having been hunters and gatherers living in virgin forests until the past generation. Although ascertainment was complete in the sense that everyone available in the hospital or its locality was examined, including visitors and all employees, their very presence at the mission implied some degree of selection. The sample comprised only a very small proportion of the gene pool and is deficient in children. It is probably not biased by patients, since all were suffering from infectious disease, none from aberrant eye refraction.
The more tractable and less shy were first tested subjectively for distance acuity by Snellen charts. Most of this sample were young and literate, males outnumbering females some 3.8 to 1. The average score of 1,302 eyes conformed closely with the modal group for Europeans, thus confirming the conclusion of Cohn (1898, p. 500), Wieser (1927, p. 89), and others that the modal visual acuity of man "in a state of nature" is not superior to that of "civilized" man. A second sample, 2,364 illiterates from 20 to 65, were examined objectively, largely because of the language handicap. They were refracted by skiascope at one half meter (corrected by subtraction of 2 D) two hours after the first instilling of cydoplegia (1% homatropine hydrobromidum, 1 to 2 drops at a time, three applications at 15-minute intervals). Members of several tribes are repre-

sented in both samples, but they are not distinguishable by any morphological criterion. Since they occasionally interbreed, they are considered to compose a single biological gene pool.
The frequency of all types of defect in both samples is notably lower than in any known sample of Asians or Europeans. No myopia of over --1/2 D was found among the 1,302 eyes of the first series and only 14 among the 3,624 eyes of the second, of which 7 were of only --1 D and 2 of --1/2 D. The 5 eyes between --3 D and --9 D constituted a rate of only 0.0014. The most myopic persons were under age 37, whereas 366 eyes or 10% of the sample were of persons 38 or older. Astigmatism of 1 D or over was found in only 29 eyes in the first series and 13 in the second, producing rates of 0.022 and 0.005, respectively. Cases varied from 1 D to 4.5 D, a majority being "against the rule," as in Europeans.
Another striking observation is the complete absence of the myopic cone among Gabon Negroes. This is a triangular area of degenerate retinal tissue on the temporal side of the fundus observed in about 10-15% of adult Europeans (Holm, 1937, pp. 142-153, p. 161). It is considered a distinct hereditary malformation, is progressive with age, and varies in frequency with the degree of myopia. Among some 24,000 Europeans of age 25 or over it has been reported in only 1% of hyperopes and emmetropes (Betsch, 1929, p. 372), but among myopes the frequency increases; it is 3% at --1 D, 16% at - 2 D, 29% at - 3 D, 50% to 70% at - 4 to - 6 D, 75% to 95% at --7 to --11 D, and 100% at higher diopters. If the conus cases were removed from a sample of refractions of Europeans, the frequency distribution of myopes would tend to balance that of

Vision Acuity

hyperopes, producing a fairly symmetrical curve. It is truly remarkable that not one case of myopic cone was found in fundus examinations of 2,729 eyes of the Gabon Negroes, of whom 179 were over 50 years old.
Sex differences were studied in the sample of illiterates. The average difference is small but significant--1,392 males averaged -J-0.36 D, and 972 females, -j-0.41 D. Chi square for refraction differences between the sexes with 5 d.f. is 1.6, which does not indicate homogeneity, with p ss .10. Among ten quinquennial age groups (20 through 65), the mean refraction of males exceeds that of females in only two--at ages 30 and 45. Age differences are progressive and correspond in trend to those of European samples, but the refractions are notably higher, i.e., more hyperopic (Holm, 1937, pp. 95-97):
20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 $ .21 .27 .37 .36 .41 .72 .52 .88 1.24 1.50 9 .31 .30 .33 .50 .63 .58 1.13 1.25 1.29 1.50
Age differences below 20 were studied in the second sample (of literates and illiterates), who were refracted subjectively and therefore cannot be compared with the first. Among 1,302 eyes in this sample only 8 exceeded + 2 % D and none exceeded --y2 D. The remaining 1,294 eyes were divided into two classes, as to whether the person had learned to read before the age of twelve (I) or after (II), the second class including illiterates. By arbitrarily grouping the ages, two observations may be noted: 1) a progressive decline in mean refraction, i.e., hyperopia, in both classes from age 13 to middle age, and 2) negligible difference in mean refraction at any age level between the literates of Class I and the illiterates and later readers of Class II, except at ages 10-12 when they were less hyperopic

than Class I. The numbers of persons are given (in parentheses) under the mean refractions, all of which are positive, i.e. hyperopic:

Age

These subsamples are unique not only in their size and subdivision by age but in having been drawn from a population of hunters. The results point strongly towards the conclusion that reading, or at least learning to read, plays a small role in the modification of spherical refraction.
Skeller (1954) refracted the eyes of 775 Angmagssalik Eskimos, a circumscribed population on the east coast of Greenland, as part of a thorough anthropological study. Since the total population numbered but 1,114 in 1927 and the entire East Greenland Eskimo population 1,470, Skeller closely approached complete ascertainment. He excluded 145 eyes with "morbid changes (maculae corneae, pterygium)" and those of young children; 183 astigmatic eyes; and 99 eyes in which the difference between the two refracting planes was > 0.5 D and < 1.0 D. He used a retinoscope at 0.5 meter (corrected by subtraction of 2 D) and employed cycloplegia (i/2% homatropine hydrobromide instilled 3 times during 2 hours prior to examination). Of the remaining 1,123 eyes (1550-145-18399), the distribution by spherical refraction shows a remarkably high rate of emmetropia: 26% were 0; 81% were under dr 1 D; 1 % were myopic, all of them under -- H/2 D; 13%were hyperopic with

-(-ID and fractions; 5% were hyperopic with -j-2 D and over, of which none exceeded +4i/2> D. Sex differences were negligible. Age differences were not notably different from those of Europeans. (The distribution in Table 8 is of a subsample of males aged 15-29).
Skeller's paper ends with a note on the frequency of myopia among populations of mixed Eskimo and Caucasoid descent (p. 188-190). Estimating the Eskimo frequency of myopia of --2 D or over at zero (he found only 9 myopic eyes of --1 D, 4 of --114 D, and none of higher negative refraction among 1123 eyes) and the Caucasian frequency at 4%, one would expect an intermediary frequency for the mixed populations which live on the west coast of Greenland. He cites the report of Donders (1864, p. 187) of 16 myopics of --2 D or over among 768 eyes, or 2%, in this region; also Lawaetz (1948), who "found all degrees of myopia to more than 20 D in a number which did not appear to be especially low." Skeller concludes (p. 190): "It is fairly reasonable to assume that the myopia frequency on the west coast is a consequence of (Eskimo) interbreeding with Caucasoids."
Mann (1954) has reported that "acuities of 10/5, 11/5, and 12/5 were not at all unusual" among aborigines of Western Australia, by E test. "In 50 consecutive tests . . . an acuity of 12/6 or better was obtained 27 times."
Hunters Compared With Civilized Populations
The three largest and most representative samples of Europeans known are referred to above. They were carefully refracted with cycloplegia after fundus examination. Since their bases of both ascertainment and examination differed from one to another and from those of

the Gabon Negroes and Eskimos, the six samples cannot be compared in detail, but even the most superficial appraisal brings out the excess of aberrances among the Europeans (Table 8, Figure 4). This excess is marked for both hyperopia and myopia. If the Europeans were more rigidly selected than the samples of Gabon Negroes and Eskimos to the extent that the most extreme cases of deficiency had been excluded by preliminary screening, this would only increase the significance of the over-all observation that European populations include higher proportions of vision defects than "primitives."
The five frequency distributions fall clearly into two categories. While all are markedly leptokurtic with mean refractions somewhat above emmetropia (i.e. towards hyperopia), both samples of hunters are distinct from all three of Europeans in three features. Their distributions are even more leptokurtic than those of the Europeans, due to the lower frequencies of both myopes and hyperopes of all degrees. For example, in Holm's data of Gabon Negroes the range within six standard deviations covers only 3.48 D, contrasted with 12.1 D for Betsch's sample of Germans. This situation suggests the lower variance in biometric, i.e., morphological traits which has been reported in feral plants and animals in contrast with their domestic relatives. The distributions are also more symmetrical, and, third, their means are less hyperopic than those of the Europeans. Since each European distribution is asymmetrical at a different region of the curve, the asymmetries tend to cancel one another when the samples are pooled. Perhaps the distribution curve of a larger pool of European populations would be more symmetrical. However, there would be no

Vision Acuity

reason to expect shorter tails. The mean refractions and the average
deviations from zero refraction, whether towards myopia or hyperopia, are as follows (in diopters):

CONCLUSION: SELECTION RELAXATION
Comparisons between any two races or populations in the frequencies of defects in visual acuity are not justified unless the samples are drawn on the same basis and examinations are made by the same methods, which should be as objective as possible. Even then the intersample differences should not be attributed entirely to race or heredity, since environmental variation cannot yet be satisfactorily evaluated and discounted. Population comparisons present many problems to investigators in the field. They become staggering to the "closet anthropologist" dealing with published data.
Nevertheless, the contrast between the lower frequencies of vision defects reported among several different samples of hunters or erstwhile hunters and the higher frequencies found repeatedly among populations with relatively long histories of agriculture and settled habitations is so striking that the accumulation of straws all blown in the same direction points strongly to the conclusion of relaxed selection. The point is raised only to be dropped at once, however, since it is far too important to be discussed in a brief review. The best discussions which have been found on the relaxation of natural selection in visual acuity attendant upon the growth of hu-

man culture are those of Crisp (1938), van Grunert (1934, pp. 8, 12, 16, 158), Holm (1954, pp. 229, 232, 236, 238, 243, etc.), Steiger (1913, pp. 425-431), and St. Wieser (1927). There is a short statement in Post (1962) concerning race differences and relaxation in color vision deficiency, a field offering several advantages over that of acuity.
Relaxed selection becomes particularly clear from comparisons between samples of Eskimos and African Negroes, as opposed to Europeans. It seems plausible in contrasts between samples of nonBrahmins and Brahmins in India. Two groups of Caucasians featuring higher frequencies of myopia than others, Egyptians and Jews, have longer histories of "civilization" than northern Europeans. Samples in China and Japan have frequencies of refraction aberrations approximately as high as those in Europe, although the distributions differ in details. Some of these studies are of refraction examinations, reporting the samples' percentage distribution of myopia and hyperopia; others are of acuity tests, reporting the percentages of Snellen categories; still others are subjective appraisals. All of them are consistent with the observation that a population's frequency of vision defects tends to be proportional to the elapsed time since it quit a "primitive" culture-habitat. All contribute at least a mite of circumstantial evidence, therefore, in support of the relaxation hypothesis.
Two rough estimates, or at least indications, of the heritability of that conglomeration of genetic entities comprising "vision defects" are found in studies of monozygotic versus dizygotic twins and studies of offspring of consanguineous parents versus those of unrelated parents. Fortified by these indications,

210 Post

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:26 08 December 2015

it might be presumed that the population differences noted here are controlled genetically in good part, as well as by variation of the environment. The fact that these population samples are of different race might be taken as additional indication of genetic control. But this is not necessary in view of the strength of the two other indications, and it might expose one to the accusation of circular reasoning.
The contrasts between various racial groups cut acutely across the lines of conventional races. There is no anthropological precedent for classifying Eskimos with Negroes, nor Europeans with Chinese. Yet a plausible explanation is offered for the particular frequency of vision defect which characterizes each racial group. It lies in the group's cultural or habitat history, since it depends upon the principal process for the differentiation of all racial traits--Darwinian selection. In the data presented, two results of the growth of culture from stone age to civilization may be speculatively indicated: a positive selection favoring low grades of myopia, and a relaxation of selection for acuity which would permit the accumulation in the population of a wide variety of hereditary deficiencies.
The hypothesis of relaxation cannot yet be proven, but it seems plausible. It is not unreasonable to suppose that early man was subject to the most rigorous selection for visual acuity. In the quest for food by whatever means, in the avoiding and combatting of enemies both human and non-human, visual defect would have led to speedy death at any age beyond that of the newborn, and at that age the more obvious defects may have been frequently eliminated by infanticide. Unmarked wildlands cannot be traversed efficiently under conditions

of leisure without good eyesight. When starved and fatigued, under stress of pursuit or being pursued, the intensity of natural selection must have been high. Probably it varied somewhat with culture-habitat--gatherers of nuts and roots with peaceful neighbors may not have been under as high selective pressures as hunters surrounded by predatory populations. It may have varied with physical environment, as from forest lands to plains. It may have varied in type as well as degree, some culture-habitats perhaps selecting slightly more for a mild hyperopia and others for emmetropia.
One may conjecture logically that throughout the long dawn of man's cultural beginnings a slowly growing proportion of individuals may have found partial relief from the pressures of selection. Occupations such as flint chipping and working with wood, fiber, skins, etc. do not demand the highest standards of distance vision. Culture-habitats which supported specialists in such industries were probably more tolerant of persons with slight refractive aberrations, particularly those who also possessed special abilities or virtues, and may have even favored a mild myopia. This relief may have been but slight until the cultures developed sufficiently to support fulltime artisans as well as agriculturalists. It may have increased following the domestication of animals, in so far as hunting may have been given up. With other developments of the neolithic revolution, the trend towards relaxation probably proceeded more rapidly. Cultures which protected large classes of the population or provided support for them, such as during the late Roman Empire, must have lowered the selection standard for vision acuity even further. One can reasonably imagine that hereditary deficiencies accumulated sufficiently under

Vision Acuity

such conditions to make possible quantitative estimates of differential population frequencies, if under exacting and standardized procedures, with carefully chosen samples and controls. It might be possible to make quantitative estimates of the force of selection through such studies.
Many questions arise from a consideration of the phenomenon of relaxed selection. Some of them might be answered by research which could be carried out by techniques now available. Among the fruits to be sought from an elementary understanding of the pathways of man's evolutionary past is a suggestion of theoutlines of the way ahead.
