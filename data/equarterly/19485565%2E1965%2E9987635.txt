A NOTE ON THE "TEST OF SIGNIFICANCE OF INTERVALS BETWEEN CONFINEMENTS OF DIFFERENT BIRTH ORDERS"

Louis Henry in his paper, "Interval Between Confinements in the Absenceof Birth Control" published in Eugenics Quarterly, Vol. 5 of December 1958, had shown that theaverage interval goes on increasing with the order of confinements (births). His conclusion was based on the analysis of variance technique which he applied to the data on intervals between different orders of confinement for a group of women who had given at least five normal births. The present note would attempt toshow that the analysis of variance technique will not be strictly applicable in such cases, and there is a need of a technique which can test the equality of means of p correlated variables on the basis of a sample of size N from Jb-variate population. The suggested technique will also be applied to judge the pattern of intervals for different orders of confinement.

(fecundity) of individual woman and relatively constant rate of reproduction over the reproductive span especially up to a certain stage of the reproductive life. This association in the intervals between different confinements brings a point of objection in thevalidity of the analysis of variance technique for testing the equality of the means of such correlated variables. The data are of the form that p-correlated variables are available on a sample of N observations. The hypothesis to be tested is that all these p-correlated variables have equal means. This is nothing but a multivariate analogue of "Students' t,"andthe test for it is given by Hotelling (1931):
T2=N ( x - -1 (X-M)
where x is the mean vector of a sample of N, u is a population mean vector, and S is the sample covariance matrix.

THE ANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEM
It is a known fact that there exists a positive association in the intervals between different confinements for the same woman. If a woman reproduces her one birth order in a short interval, she is likely to take a shorter time for other intervals also, till the last or last but one birth order. From the data under consideration, it was found that the correlation between intervals 1 to2 and 2 to 3was of the order of 0.53. Such phenomenon is generally attributed to differences in the biological capacity

DATA USED
Making use of the sufficiently accurate data given by L. Henry referred to above, collected from Parish Registersof Crulai (a village in Normandy) Hotelling's test will be applied to test the equality of means of the intervals for different confinements.

on four birth intervals (1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, and 4 to 5,* which can be called *i» x2, x3, xt). These four intervals between five confinements were converted into three contrasts (yu y2, y3) by taking the following combinations:
yl = x2-x1 yz=x3-x1 y3=xi-x1
Contrast could be conveniently chosen. Here, these three contrasts were chosen by maximizing the distances between the birth orders so that if overall value of T2 statistic comes out to be significant, we can test the significance of each of these contrasts and determine the stage of birth order which mainly contributes to this significance. These three contrasts have been treated as three correlated variables, in which case test ofsignificance in multivariate analysis in the problems of a single sample is applicable (Rao, 1952, p. 239). The details of various steps are given in the Appendix. The value of the statistic T2 is 5.2188 and is found to be significant as the5% as well as 1% level of significance. This would prove that the interval between different confinements does not remain constant, as inferred by L. Henry.
It will be of interest to test whether the interval between confinements increases continuously (with every birth order) or the pattern is of the type that the change is insignificant in the earlier birth orders and younger ages but becomes significant after a certain ageand birth order. The above data of 46 women will be used to make inferences on such ideas. Considering thefirstcontrast yv and taking the statistic (AT--1)7*! (shown in the Appendix), it was found that it is insignificant at the 5% level, meaning thereby that there is no in-

crease between the intervals 1 to 2 and 2 to 3 birth orders. The statistic (N--1)T2 (with the help of second contrast) is slightly significant at the 5% level but is insignificant at the 1% level. Coming to the statistic (AT-- 1)T3 (based on third contrast), it is found highly significant at the 5% as well as the 1% level of significance. From the statistic (2V-1)7\ and (N~l)T2, it can be said that there is no increase or almost negligible increase in the average interval 1 to 2 to 2 to 3, and there is very slight increase in the average interval 3 to 4as compared to the average of 1 to 2. The statistic (N--l)T3 shows quite significant increase in the interval 4 to 5 over 1 to2. While making statements about the sudden increase of interval 4 to 5, one must consider one more factor. The data used here are for those women who had at least five normal births. It does not consider whether these families have next birth orders or not. In case a few families have fifth as the last birth order, their interval 4 to 5 will be large; this fact may partly explain the sharp increase shown by the data.
SUMMARY
The multivariate analogue of "Students' t" showed that the interval between confinements did not remain constant with the order of confinement. In an attempt to find out whether the intervals increased continuously with the order of confinement or remained constant for some birth orders and then increased, it was found that there was no significant increase in the intervals from 1-2 to 2-3, almost negligible increase in intervals 1-2 to 3-4, and a sudden increase in the intervals 1-2 to 4-5. The sudden increase in the last case could partly be assigned to the fact that a few women might have had fifth asthe last birth order.
