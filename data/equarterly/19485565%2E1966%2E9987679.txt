GENETICS
Anti-Mongolism: Studies in an Infant with a Partial Monosomy of the 21 Chromosome. L. E. Reisman et al. Lancet, 1 (1966): 394-395.
A clinical picture that contrasts with Down's syndrome in many, but not in all respects, appears to result from the cytological converse of trisomy-21. Some of the contrasting stigmata are muscular hypertonia, downward-slanting eyes, and large ears. The abnormalities were shared by this child and another case, reported from France.
A Study of Maternal Age in Down's Syndrome. H. O. Akesson and H. Forssman. Ann. Hum. Genet., 29 (1966): 271-276.
Down's syndrome can be separated statistically into a category that depends upon maternal age and a smaller category, about a third, that is independent of maternal age. Approximately the same proportions are obtained either by mathematically fitting parameters to maternal age data or by assuming that the age-independent class always occurs at the frequency found in the youngest mothers.
Comment: Since about 96% of Down's syndrome is associated with trisomy-21, the above finding suggests that much of the nondisjunction is independent of maternal age.
Phenylketonuria in a Woman of Normal Intelligence and Her Child. T. L. Perry and B. Tischler.

New Eng. J. Med., 274 (1966): 10181019.
If mentally normal people may carry the genetic and metabolic defect of phenylketonuria (PKU), then to this extent the mental defect may be displaced onto their metabolically normal offspring; for it is suspected that elevated maternal blood levels of phenylalanine cause fetal brain damage. In the case reported, however, the child was genetically abnormal, the parents probably distant cousins. At least one screening program is finding twice as many cases of PKU as were predicted from the incidence of the mental defect, and the discrepancy may represent cases with normal mentality. Perhaps all pregnant women, as well as infants, should be screened for PKU.
Diagnostic and Therapeutic Implications of Persistent Hyperphenylalaninemia in an Infant Heterozygous for the Gene of Phenylketonuria. A. J. Schneider and S. D. Garrard. J.Pediat.,68 (1966): 704-712.
Any criteria that detect all cases of phenylketonuria in infants lead to erroneous inclusion of some heterozygotes, since the latter sometimes have high blood phenylalanine at early ages. These cases are common enough to double the apparent frequency of PKU. A case is reported of a child who presented all metabolic features of early PKU and was placed on a diet at 10 weeks. Unusual facility of control led to testing of the family and discovery that the father could hardly be a carrier.

Detection of Effects of Ionizing Radiation by Population Studies. G. Hems. Brit. Med. J., 1 (1966): 393396.
To be useful as detectors of small increases in mutagenesis, leukemia and specific locus mutation rates both require larger populations than those used up to now. The sex ratio is potentially a more sensitive detector, applicable to mutations resulting from increased background radiation or from ordinary occupational exposure. If 150 rads are necessary to double the mutation rate in man as in mice, and if the average human exposure to background radiation is 3 rads, only a fiftieth of present mutations is due to such radiation.

Natural Selection on Polymorphisms in Northeastern Brazil. N. E. Morton et al. Amer. J. Hum. Genet., 18 (1966): 153-171.
The tendency of natural selection to eliminate the deleterious side effects of frequent genes, and the reduced mortality in modern human populations, together leave little prospect for documenting many instances of selection in human polymorphisms. Even where selection does maintain a balanced polymorphism, the individual heterozygote may have no advantage in his own survival and reproduction; selection may be balanced in several other ways. A study of 16 polymorphic systems in Brazilian migrants demonstrated selection only with respect to ABO.

An Estimation of the Cumulative Mutation Rate for Sex-linked Lethals in Man Which Produce Fetal Deaths. E. L. Krehbiel. Amer. J. Hum. Genet., 18 (1966): 127-143.
The fall in proportion of male births with increasing parental age may depend mainly on the correlated age of the maternal grandfather at the mother's own birth. Among fetal deaths in Minnesota loss of males increased very significantly with maternal grandfather's age, while the relation with parental age did not attain significance. On the principal assumption that the excess male fetal deaths are due to recessive sexlinked lethals, the findings support the hypothesis that mutations accumulate with parental age in the gametes of males much more than in the gametes of females, presumably as copy-errors in DNA replication. The estimated mutation rate agrees with that previously obtained in a rather similar analysis in Italy.

The Gene Interaction Component of the Genetic Load. J. L. King. Genetics, 53 (1966): 402-413.
Interaction or synergism between deleterious genes may be more frequent than is commonly supposed. This would alter some present concepts about the relation between mutation rates and the genetic load, since synergism increases the efficiency of selective eliminations. Many "deleterious" genes might, in fact, be entirely harmless except in lethal combinations. Gene interaction may be postulated in any physiological system where a threshold of viability may be exceeded by combined small genetic effects.
Polyallelic Random Drift in Relation to Evolution. S. Wright. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 55 (1966): 10741081.
On the assumption that a great many of the possible alleles of any gene are nearly equivalent in selection, any species with large populations (in the millions) probably maintains a great num-

ber of alleles (e.g., hundreds) at most loci. Even under stable environmental conditions and large numbers, this genetic process is subject to perpetual drift in which the number as well as the identity of the alleles continually changes. This increases the evolutionary potential of a population far above that based on two-allele systems.
