T. HE THEORY OF ISOLATION PLAYS AN im-
pJoLrHtant role in modern neo-Darwinistic thinking, especially for the understanding of micro-evolution and race formation. The commonest and, from a bio-geographical point of view, most important type of isolation is geographical. One approach to this problem is to study the incidence of marriages between individuals from adjacent populations. The frequency of marriages in which both partners are from the same region is correlated with the mobility of the population and the degree of geographical isolation.
Investigations concerning cousin marriages, marriages between adjacent regions, and migrations are very difficult in the Scandinavian countries and require original field work and the collection of church register data from many different parishes.
The files of the large anthropométrie survey "The Racial Characters of the Swedish Nation" contain information about the birthplaces (parishes) of both parents of most of the examined conscripts. These data were used only for the grouping of the material into, e.g., rural or urban communities. This extensive material collected over a period of several years should give a good opportunity to study regional variations of isolation. I have therefore used these data for an investigation of the problem as outlined above with reference to the county of Norrbotten.
*Head: Professor Jan A. Böök, M.D., Ph.D.

The county of Norrbotten covers approximately one-fourth of the total area of Sweden. It is the most sparsely inhabited county of Sweden with an average of about 3 inhabitants per square km. About 65 per cent of the Lapps and 95 per cent of the Finns of Sweden live within this area.
II To the original material from "The Racial Characters óf the Swedish Nation" further data of about 1,000 conscripts were added. These individuals were examined by the late Professor H. Lundborg after the publication of the large survey, and the results have not been published before. The material does not include marriage data for the Lapps since these were not enlisted in the army at that time. As the material deals with marriages between parents of young men who underwent their military service in 1923-24, it can be said to reflect conditions at the turn of the last century.
The parishes have been grouped into 17 regions. Because of the smallness of some of the parishes a number of them had to be joined into larger suitable units.
To obtain a measure of the relative isolation of the different regions, the number of marriages with both partners from the same region have been calculated in percentages of the total number of marriages with at least one partner from the region in question. The result is shown in Table 1 and in Figure 1. A high value should correspond to a high degree of isolation.

Regions 10, 11 and 12 display the highest values. The lowest values were found in region 3 and in regions 13, 14 and 15 of the eastern part of the county.
The variation between regions was examined by means of the following heterogeneity test (Fisher, 1948) :

where p is the percentage in the whole sample, p the percentage in the partial samples and n the absolute number of marriages with both partners from the

same region in the total sample. The value of x2 is 27.5 with 16 degrees of freedom, which gives a significance level of 0.05 > P > 0.02. Most of the parishes have a frequency of intra marriages, which is higher than 50 per cent. The mean for the whole material is 57.8 per cent.
The inier-regional variations coincide roughly with two different areas which were presumably more broken up as isolates, one area consisting of regions 3, 8 and 9 and another area consisting of regions 13, 14 and 15. These areas are the most likely migration passages of the county: the eastern area for exchange of people with Finland and the western area as a main passage westward along the river Lule.
Ill The following correlations between the parameters mentioned above and the anthropological and demographical features of Norrbotten county as well as natural

barriers and passages are of further interest. Flodström (1915) has demonstrated that
in the beginning of this century region 3 (the parish of Jokkmokk) had a lower fertility than the rest of the county.
Recent detailed rearrangement of the primary material of the large Swedish anthropométrie survey "The Racial Characters of the Swedish Nation" has shown that about 1925 region 3 had a lower cephalic index than the surrounding regions (Beckman 1956). This indicates a Nordic introgression into region 3.
In a blood-group investigation of about 8,000 conscripts from this county it was found that the A-gene showed a significant heterogeneity in the regional distribution (the same regions as in this investigation were used). Region 3 also deviates from the surrounding regions inasmuch as the A-gene frequency is lower. As the Lapps who have high A-frequencies presumably

were the original settlers of the county, the regions with relatively high A-frequencies should be the oldest and most isolated ones. They should have had the least introgression from the Nordic and East-Baltic races. The low A-frequency in region 3 indicates an isolate-breaking immigration from the Luleâ area, which is known to be relatively Nordic (Lundman 1946).
Bylund (1956) mentions that the river Lule gives good opportunities of traveling to the inner parts of Norrbotten. The river Kalix on the contrary is pointed out as a difficult passage for migration, and the southern areas have had bad communications.
The eastern area is connected with other good water passages, namely, the rivers Torne and Muonio. Here the average stature is considerably lower than in the rest of northern Sweden and similar to adjacent Finland (Lundman 1946). The regions 13 and 14 are the only ones in the county of Norrbotten which have B-gene frequencies higher than 10 per cent, thus indicating a relationship with Finland, which has frequencies that always exceed 10 per cent (Beckman 1956).
Thus the frequencies of intra- and intermarriages, respectively, seem to agree with other observations insofar as they appear to fit into a pattern which may explain

some of the evolutionary features of the
population of this area.
As mentioned above, the average fre-
quency of zn ira-parish marriages for the
whole county was 57.8 per cent. Presum-
ably most of the regions should be con-
sidered as isolates in or about 1900.
Special investigations by Book and Kost-
mann (1956) indicate that at least parts of
regions 16 and 17 and region 12 constitute
geographical isolates.
