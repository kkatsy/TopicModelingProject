·-VKV is A RAPIDLY progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system found in the Fore linguistic group and their immediate neighbours in the Okapa Sub-District of the Eastern Highlands of New Guinea (Figs. 1 and 2). During the past decade, when this SubDistrict has been accessible to Europeans, this disease has been the subject of extensive investigations (see reference list). However, the cause of kuru is still unknown and no form of treatment has been found effective. The native people continue to account for it in terms of sorcery.
Kuru rarely lasts over a year and is often fatal in about six months from onset of symptoms. The first symptom is locomotor ataxia. This becomes progressively worse and is soon accompanied by a distinctive tremor involving the head, trunk and extremities. Within a few months, the patient is unable to walk or stand. Speech slowly becomes blurred and then unintelligible. The final stage, when the patient is completely incapacitated, is usually short, the mute victim very likely succumbing to starvation, infected decubitus ulcération or bronchopneumonia. Three stages--ambulant, sedentary and terminal--may thus be

recognized fairly readily. Post-mortem examination has revealed widespread neuronal degeneration especially in the cerebellum and extrapyramidal tract. The various clinical and pathological findings have been considered as suggestive of a toxic or degenerative process (Zigas and Gajdusek, 1957; Fowler and Roberston, 1959).
Some of the most remarkable features of the kuru situation are the very high frequency of the disease in the Fore linguistic group and the various population and family patterns which have been uncovered. This article is concerned with some recent work in this field.
SEX AND AGE DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE AF-
FECTED AND THE DURATION OF THE DISEASE
Kuru is predominantly a disease of adult females and of children. It has not as yet been found in anyone under four years of age. In males the distribution of age of onset is unimodal with a mean at about 14 years. In females, the distribution is bimodal, there being an earlyonset group (4-16 years approximately) and a late-onset group (approximately 17 years and over). A feature of the sex and age distribution is that the total number of kuru cases found in males is very close to the number of early-onset

female victims. In considering the age distribution, it seems important to distinguish between those who can be seen with kuru at any one time and those who have died from the disease (Fig. 3). The proportion of adult females seems to be higher in those seen with the disease. Such a difference could arise in various ways. For example, the average duration of the disease may be shorter in male and early-onset female cases than in adult females. Again, the differences may be due to a failure to detect and record some early childhood cases. If this were so, we might expect to find that the recorded cases in children were more often in the sedentary and terminal stages than were those in adult females. On the data available at present, this does not seem to be so. Another possibility is that the sex and age distribution is changing with time.

The results of a recent follow-up of kuru victims, carried out one year after they were first recorded, lend some support to the suggestion that the average duration of the disease may be longer in adult females than in other victims (Table 1). Out of 89 recorded victims, only six (all females) were reported as being still alive one year later. Some particulars of these six women are included in Table 1. Out of 105 kuru victims (including the above 89) recorded early in 1960, only three (all adult females) were alive sixteen months later. In one of these women, as shown in Table 1, there was some regression of kuru during this period but recently she was reported to have entered the terminal stage of the disease--a stage which none has been seen to survive. Earlier records include a few well-documented cases, one in a boy and several in girls, where kuru was

manifest for over two years before death. Furthermore, there are reliable records of several individuals who had been seen in the early stages of kuru and were later seen with an apparently full remission. Regression or remission seems to occur in about 2 or 3 per cent of cases in the South Fore. It will be of interest to see how this frequency varies with locality.
POPULATION STATISTICS
Table 2 shows the number of kuru patients recorded during recent Administration census of the Okapa Sub-District. The corresponding values for the prevalence (expressed here as the number of kuru patients per thousand of population) are also included in this table. In July 1959, C. Gannon recorded 13 males and 86 female kuru patients in the South Fore. Prevalence data are thus available for the South Fore for three separate occasions in the last three years. These data show remarkably little variation in the total prevalence of kuru in this Census Division. The proportion of males among the patients has increased but the change recorded so far is not significant. It will be of great interest, however, to see if the trend towards a higher proportion of males is maintained.
Table 3 shows the number of deaths from kuru recorded as having occurred in the intervals between recent Admintration censuses. These data indicate that there has been little change in the mortality rate from kuru in the Fore in the period concerned. The most recent figuresfor the South Fore show that kuru is responsible there for 30 per cent of the deaths in males and as many as 70 per cent of those in females. The large increase which occurred in these percentages since the 1960 census is probably attributable to the fact that the overall

death rate in the South Fore was considerably increased in 1959 by an influenza epidemic.
The data of Tables 2 and 3 furnish a basis for calculating a typical period during which kuru manifests itself before death. If we may assume that there is no temporal variation in the incidence or duration of the disease, we can arrive at an estimate of the typical duration by dividing the prevalence by the death rate. Using mean values for kuru prevalence and death rate for the whole Sub-district, we find the typical duration to be 7.8 months in males, while for females it is 8.8 months. Although the differences in these estimates of the duration of kuru may possibly be ascribed to chance, the suggestion that the average duration may be longer in females than males is an important one and deserves careful study by the observation of the actual duration in many individual cases. The possibility of there being significant differences in the duration of kuru at different ages and in different parts of the Sub-District must not be overlooked and this also needs detailed investigation.
Table 4 shows various population statistics for the four Census Divisions of the Okapa Sub-District as well as for the Kamano and Agarabi Census Divisions. In the Kamano there are only occasional cases of kuru, while as far as is known, no one born in the Agarabi has been a victim of the disease. This Division has been included for purposes of comparison since the rate of natural increase of its population may be considered to be typical of Eastern Highlands people free from kuru and with ready access to medical services. The various statistics have been calculated from Administration census records. As there has been a period of at least 16 months between recent

censuses of the South Fore (and still longer periods for some of the other Divisions) there have presumably been many infants who were born and also died between two successive censuses and who are not included in the records. Thus the estimates of the birth and death rates will be lower, and perhaps quite a lot lower, than theactual values. However, the estimates of the rate of natural increase of population, whichare unaffected by these discrepancies, are believed to be fairly accurate.
There aresome striking differences between the population statistics for the Agarabi and Kamano Divisions on the one hand and those for the kuru region on the other. From the Agarabi with its slight excess of females, through the Kamano with its approximate equality in numbers of the twosexes, we can observe a remarkable change to a largedeficiency of females in theother Divisions. The South Fore has the extraordinary overall sexratio of 166 males to 100 females. In some South Fore villages, males comprise 70 per cent of the population. The sex ratio is even more extreme in adults. There are twice asmany adult males as females in theSouth Fore as a whole, and in several villages, the ratio exceeds three to one.
Because of thegrave shortage of young adult females, and the not uncommon practice of girls of about fourteen years being bought in marriage bymales much older than themselves, a large proportion of theyoung men in theSouth Forecannot find wives. Until a few years ago, many menin this community werepreoccupied with local fighting. Now that warfare has been suppressed and roads have been cut through this rugged mountainous country, there is no natural obstacle to prevent them from leaving this region. Their emigration wouldob-

viously lead to a reduction in the rate of increase of the South Fore population. It might also be very detrimental to the health of the native population in those areas to which they migrate.
The rate of natural increase of population in the Fore Census Divisions shows rather large variation between the two or three intercensus intervals for which data are available. On the other hand, census data which are available for the Agarabi and Kamano Census Divisions for a longer period show comparatively little change from year to year in the rate of natural increase. The rate of natural increase in the Fore was probably unusually low in 1959 because of the influenza epidemic previously mentioned. It is of some interest that, for this period, there was in the North Fore a marked diminution in the recorded birth rate with little change in the recorded death rate, whereas, in the South Fore, there was a marked increase in the recorded death rate and comparatively little change in the birth rate. Such a difference could have come about if in the North Fore relatively more of the deaths resulting from the influenza epidemic were in newborn children (who thus did not get into the record) than was the case in the South Fore. The different values found for the rate of natural increase of population in the various Census Divisions reflect to a large extent the higher incidence of kuru in the Fore than eleswhere. It is especially noteworthy that in the South Fore the rate of natural increase of the female population has been negative throughout the last few years when census records have been maintained. It appears also that there is a natural tendency, under existing conditions, for the proportion of males in the South Fore to increase beyond its present extraor-

dinarily high value. The rate of natural increase of the sex ratio is currently between one and two per cent per annum. If, as native informants report, kuru is of recent origin in the Fore, a change of about this magnitude may have been taking place annually in the sex ratio for some years. On the other hand, it must be noted that the recent extension of medical services to the South Fore has probably resulted in a greater relative reduction in the death rate among males than females and so may have exaggerated this sex difference. The analysis of more detailed vital statistics, collected over a prolonged period, may well throw further light on this critical aspect of the kuru problem.
FAMILY STUDIES
Zigas and Gajdusek (1957), after recording that the aetiology of kuru remained obscure, went on to write, (p. 753), "Genetic predisposition is strongly suggested by the type of clinical picture the disease presents, by the unusual age and sex distribution of cases, by high familial incidence in a closely intermarried community, by the phenomenon of anticipation (cases appearing at an earlier age in the second generation), by occasional genealogies wherein several siblings have died of the disease on reaching approximately the same age, and by the pattern of apparent introduction of kuru through marriage into communities of low kuru incidence on the boundary between kuru and non-kuru regions. Nevertheless, the extensive neurological degeneration found on histological study strongly suggests some toxic factor."
Analysis of pedigrees bearing on kuru, collected in the northern part of the Fore area by Robson and Rhodes in January 1958, revealed distinctive family

patterns with respect to the disease (Bennett, Rhodes and Robson, 1958, 1959). Pedigrees collected subsequently in other parts of the Okapa Sub-District have also shown the same patterns (Bennett, Gray and Auricht, 1959).
Of the deaths recorded in pedigrees collected in the South Fore until August 1960, approximately 56 per cent of those in females and 11 per cent of those in males were ascribed to kuru. However, as shown in Table 5, over 80 per cent of the mothers of male and early-onset female victims of kuru themselves died from kuru. According to the South Fore pedigree records, about 40 per cent of the mothers of late-onset female victims died from kuru. Knowledge of these family patterns allows us to distinguish several classes of individuals who are particularly prone to kuru and to assign empirical risk rates to them. However, we need to find out much more about these patterns. It is desirable, for example, that we should know whether the patterns vary according as the mother or offspring first dies of kuru and also, in greater detail, how the patterns depend

on the ages of the individuals concerned. Some further light may be thrown on
this aspect of the problem by considering the deaths of offspring of women classified as those who died from kuru or from other causes. From Table 6, it may be seen that kuru was recorded as having been responsible for the deaths of 159 (i.e. 30 per cent) of the 534 deceased sons of women who died from kuru, as against only 32 (i.e. 5.5 per cent)

of the 580 deceased sons of women who died from causes other than kuru. There is very little difference, however, between .Parts A and B of Table 6 in respect to the percentage of sons who died from kuru aged 17 years or over. This is 15/534 (i.e. 2.8 per cent) where the mothers died from kuru and 13/580 (i.e. 2.2 per cent) where the mothers died from other causes. This difference may serve to emphasize the importance of obtaining more detailed knowledge of age dependence in the family patterns. From Table 6, we see that kuru was recorded as the cause of death of 396 (i.e. 60 per cent) of the 659 deceased daughters of women who died from kuru as against 338 (i.e. 51 per cent) of the 656 deceased daughters of women who died from causes other than kuru. Of the female deaths from kuru included in Part A of the table, 220/396 (i.e. 56 per cent) occurred in individuals recorded as under 17 years of age, as against 61/338 (i.e. 18 per cent) in Part B. Mothers in Part B had 318 daughters who died from causes other than kuru and 149 (i.e. 47 per cent) of these died under 17 years of age. On the other hand, mothers in Part A had 253 daughters who died from causes other than kuru and as many as 209 (i.e. 83 per cent) of these died under 17 years of age. Differences in the same direction are found in the cases of sons who died from causes other than kuru.
These family patterns are surely of significance for an understanding of kuru and its causation. But exactly what it is that is responsible for them we cannot say at present. The question of whether or not these patterns are consistent with any simple genetical model was considered by Bennett, Rhodes and Robson (1958, 1959). They pointed out that these patterns are very similar to those which would be expected if kuru

had the following simple genetical basis: that there are two autosomal alíeles Ku and ku and in females, homozygotes Kuku and hétérozygotes Kuku are earlyand late-onset kuru victims respectively, while in males the homozygotes Kuku are kuru victims but the hétérozygotes Kuku are clinically normal. Although kuru does have affinities with some types of spino-cerebellar degenerations, in many of which a familial incidence has been recorded, it seems rather improbable that, if kuru did have the above genetical basis, it would be present with such high frequency as it has in the South Fore. Temporal variation in the incidence of kuru, environmental agents and maternal habits are some of the factors which may contribute to the family patterns and about whose role we require further information. Certainly, there is much yet to be learned in population and family studies of kuru.
