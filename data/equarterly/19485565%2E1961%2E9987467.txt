THE CONNECTICUT TWIN REGISTRY

HE Connecticut State Department of Health is establishing the Connecticut Twin Registry. A listing of all multiple births occurring in the State of Connecticut since January 1, 1897, is being compiled. The birth records of all the local Registrars of Vital Statistics are being searched for multiple births occurring between 1897-1955. A duplicate set of punch cards on all multiple births occurring since January 1, 1956, is being furnished annually by the Public Health Statistics Section of the State Department of Health.
All multiple births are checked against death certificates. Only those multiple births in which at least two members survived to one year of age have identifying information punched on IBM cards. Information concerning perinatal, neonatal, and infant mortality is being collected but this information is not routinely placed on punch cards.
The Registry is being created to obtain a twin population to use in con-

junction with the Connecticut Tumor Registry for genetic studies of human cancer. The Registry is also intended to be used as a research source for studies of disease and studies in the fields of genetics, psychology, sociology, etc. The Registry will cooperate with trained individuals who wish to use its facilities for research purposes, and will supply available data to them.
Researchers requesting data of the Connecticut Twin Registry will be expected to abide by such requirements as may be set forth by the State Department of Health. All requests will be reviewed as to the qualifications of the investigator and to the merit of the proposed study. In order to avoid duplication of efforts, abstracts of information obtained and zygosity determinations will be requested of investigators using these facilities.
Requests for further information and/or use of the listings of multiple births should be made to:
