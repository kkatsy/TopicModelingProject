Most geneticists and demographers agree that, although the capacity for reproduction may be influenced by genetic factors and by such environmental conditions as nutrition and disease, variations in fertility between different subgroups within existing human populations arise chiefly from social and psychological factors. Since the great changes now taking place in the social structure of human societies probably have ah effect on fertility, it is desirable to investigate reproductive differentials in a variety of human societies at frequent intervals in order to assess the biological consequences of various social practices.
Many studies have clearly shown that differential fertility has existed with respect to educational attainment for many decades (see Kiser, 1960; or Grabill, Kiser, and Whelpton, 1958, for a review of these studies). The type, amount, and quality of formal education that Americans receive have changed very dramatically during the past 50 years. Changes such as these which are still taking place in American society undoubtedly have an effect on fertility and on the relationship between intelligence and fertility.
Many investigators have attempted to determine the nature of the relationship between intelligence and fertility (see Anastasi, 1956, for a review of the literature). The methodology and conclusions of most of these studies were based on the assumption that the relationship between the tested intelligence of an individual and the number of siblings

that individual had was equal to the relationship between the tested intelligence of an individual and the number of offspring that individual had at the end of his reproductive period. This assumption has been shown to be erroneous because of the fact that as intelligence decreases the probability of leaving no offspring increases and because the relationship between intelligence and fertility appears to be a dynamic one and may be changing rapidly (Higgins, Reed, and Reed, 1962; Bajema, 1963; Gibson and Young, 1965).
The few studies that have been based on the relationship between the tested intelligence of an individual and the number of offspring he has (Conrad and Jones, 1932; Willoughby and Coogan, 1940; Reed and Reed, 1965) have been based on samples which were either very unrepresentative with respect to educational attainment or which included uncompleted families or which included individuals which varied greatly as to age. These methodological shortcomings make it very difficult to (1) accurately estimate the relationship between intelligence and fertility; and (2) estimate the effect of psychological, social, political, and economic practices prevailing during a given period of time on the relationship between intelligence and fertility. The Kalamazoo Study (Bajema, 1963) was designed to overcome these methodological shortcomings of previous studies.
This report will describe the effect of educational attainment on the relation-

ship between intelligence and fertility among a group of native-born white individuals who were born in 1916 or 1917 and who took the Terman Group Intelligence Test while attending the sixth grade in the Kalamazoo, Michigan, Public School System.
THE SAMPLE
The individuals in the sample were (or would have been in the case of deceased individuals) either 45 or 46 years of age at the time the data were collected so that their fertility can be essentially considered to be completed. A previous report on this population (Bajema, 1963) described the data collecting procedures in detail and the statistical tests employed to determine that the sample did not deviate significantly from the population in terms of sex ratio or test score distribution.
Life histories were compiled on 979 (85.6%) of the 1,144 native-born white individuals in the population. Since most individuals do not graduate from college until age 22, it was necessary to exclude 22 persons from this sample because they died before reaching age 22. This prevents the biasing of the fertility data in favor of the college graduate group.
The population under study consisted of (1) white individuals only; (2) nativeborn Americans only; (3) predominately Protestant individuals; (4) individuals who spent almost all of their potentially most productive childbearing years during the Great Depression and World War II; (5) individuals who spent all or most of their lives in an urban environment; and (6) individuals with above average educational attainments.
The mean number of years of academic schooling (excluding business college and other nonacademic training beyond high school) was 11.99years for the population

under study. The correlation coefficient between IQ and the number of years of academic schooling was + .58. This is of the same magnitude as the correlation coefficient of + .57 between IQ and number of years of academic schooling observed by Benson (1942) in a follow-up study of 1,680 students who were tested in the sixth grade of the Minneapolis Public School System in 1923. The mean number of years of academic schooling was 11.76 years, and the correlation coefficient between IQ and number of years of academic schooling was +.61 for females in the population under study. For males the mean number of years of academic schooling was 12.22 years, and the correlation coefficient between IQ and number of years of academic schooling was +.58.
The data were divided into three groups with respect to educational attainment: 6-11 years (junior high and high school dropouts); 12--15 years (high school graduates but not college graduates); and 16+ years (college graduates). The data were subdivided with respect to sex also. Table 1 gives die number of individuals reporting in each class and their mean IQ score.
FERTILITY
The number of offspring recorded for each individual included in the sample does not include children who died prior to age one. Some children are counted twice; once for the father and once for the mother if both parents were born in 1916 or 1917 and attended the sixth grade in the Kalamazoo Public School System. (There were 32 marriages involving 63 different individuals where both partners were included in the sampie.)
The number of offspring per individual ranged from 0 to 15 (Table 2) with a mean of 2.29. The mean number of

offspring per individual was greater for females than males in the total sample (Table 3) but the difference is not statistically significant at the 5% level.

RELATION BETWEEN FERTILITY AND EDUCATION
The mean number of offspring per individual for the three educational attainment groups (Table 3) is significantly heterogeneous at the 5% level. Individuals with 12-15 years of schooling had the lowest mean number of offspring per individual of the three educational attainment groups. When the educational attainment groups are subdivided according to sex, it was found that among the males the college graduate group had the highest fertility while the females with the least amount of education had the highest fertility among the females (Table 3). Two-way analysis of variance indicated that the interaction between sex and educational attainment with respect to fertility is statistically significant at the 10% level.
The correlation coefficient between the number of years of academic schooling completed and fertility was +.009 and is not significantly different from zero at the 5% level. The relationship between the number of years of academic schooling completed and fertility was positive for males (r=+.O56) but negative for females (r= --.030). This difference between the sexes is significantly different from zero at the 6% level.

THE EFFECT OF EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTELLIGENCE AND FERTILITY

The relationship between intelligence and fertility is measured in this report by the coefficients of regression (slope) and correlation (intensity). These two statistics were calculated without the measurements being subjected to any kind of transformation. While the frequency curves of the IQ test scores follow the normal curve quite closely the frequency curves of the number of offspring are strongly skewed toward the zero end of the scale. The significance levels quoted, therefore, are approximations only. Nevertheless, the number in the various categories compared is sufficiently large to provide a reasonably accurate indication of significance.

The coefficients of regression and cor-

relation between intelligence and fertil-

ity for both sexes are all positive with

respect to each educational attainment

group (Table 4). Analysis of covariance

indicated that (1) the slopes (byx's) are

not significantly heterogeneous at the

5% level, and (2) the elevations (ayi's)

are significantly heterogeneous at the

1% level.

;

When the educational attainment groups were subdivided according to sex the coefficients of regression and correlation for males with 12-15 years of schooling and for females with 16 or more years of schooling were found to be negative. Analysis of covariance indicated that the three slopes (byx's) for males are significantly heterogeneous at the 5% level. For females the three slopes (byi's) were shown not to be significantly heterogeneous at the 5% level. However, the three elevations (ayx's) for females were shown to be significantly heterogeneous at the 5% level.

were compared within each educational attainment group with respect to the regression coefficients and correlation coefficients, the only sex difference that is statistically significant at the 5% level is that existing between male and female college graduates.
THE EFFECT OF EDUCATIONAL ATTAIN-
MENT ON MARITAL STATUS AND CHILD-
LESSNESS
Previous studies of the relationship between fertility and intelligence have shown that the exclusion of nonreproductive individuals from the sample can result in erroneous conclusions being drawn from the data (Bajema, 1963; Gibson and Young, 1965; Higgins, Reed, and Reed, 1962). Since the educational attainment of an individual is a function of his intelligence, it is desirable to determine if differentials exist between the various educational attainment groups with respect to marital status and childlessness.
The proportions childless for the three educational attainment groups (Table 2) do not deviate significantly from the mean proportion childless for the total

sample at the 5% level. The same is true for males and for females when the three educational attainment groups are subdivided according to sex. The proportions never married for the three educational attainment groups (Table 5) do not deviate significantly from the mean proportion never married for the total sample at the 5% level. The same is also true for males and for females when the three educational attainment groups are subdivided according to sex.

THE EFFECT OF EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT ON GENERATION LENGTH
Generation length is measured in this report by the mean age of the parent at the birth of all his children (Table 6). The mean generation lengths for the three educational attainment groups are

significantly heterogeneous at the 1% level. Two-way analysis of variance indicated that the interaction between sex and educational attainment with respect to generation length is statistically significant at the 1% level. The mean generation length for females is shorter than that for males within each of the three educational attainment groups. The difference between the sexes with respect to mean generation length decreases as the level of educational attainment increases.

DISCUSSION
The data of this study support the hypothesis that the effect of educational attainment (number of years of academic schooling) on fertility is nonadditive at the present for populations similar to the one on which this study is based. The fact that individuals with 12-15 years of schooling had significantly fewer offspring per individual than individuals with either 6-11 years or 16 or more years of schooling strongly supports this hypothesis. The relationship between educational attainment and fertility appears to be a bimodal one quite analogous to the relationship between intelligence and fertility for the total sample which was determined previously (Bajema, 1963). Another American study (Higgins, Reed, and Reed, 1962; Reed and Reed, 1965) and an English study (Gibson and Young, 1965) have also found that the relationship between intelligence and fertility is a bimodal one. In each case

the bimodal nature of the relationship between intelligence and fertility became apparent only when all of the childless individuals were included in the sample. The bimodal nature of the relationship between educational attainment and fertility is apparent in this study even when childless individuals are excluded from the sample.
Several investigators (Higgins, Reed, and Reed, 1962; Gibson and Young, 1965) have found that the probability of being childless increases as IQ decreases. In the population under study the probability of being childless also increases as IQ decreases (Bajema, 1963). However, the relationship between the probability of being childless and educational attainment in the population under study is very small, thus making it difficult to determine if the relationship is positive or negative (Table 2). The same is also true of the relationship between the probability of being unmarried and educational attainment (Table 5). Dice, Clark, and Gilbert (1964) also found a very small relationship between the probability of being unmarried and educational attainment. However, since the relationship between fertility and educational attainment also appears to be small the inclusion of nonreproductive individuals in the sample is necessary if estimates concerning the relationship between fertility and educational attainment are to be as accurate as possible.
The 1960 U.S. census data for 40-14year-old women residing in urbanized areas shows a linear negative relationship between educational attainment and the fertility of women (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1964). The observed relationship between educational attainment and the fertility of the females in this study is also negative and: not bimodal (Table 3). It is the strong bimodal

312

nature of the positive relationship between educational attainment and the fertility of the males in this study that makes the over-all relationship for both sexes a bimodal one. Since assortative mating for educational attainment is not complete (Kiser, 1965) one would not expect the fertility of males and females of the same age and educational attainment group to be equal. One might also expect to find differences in fertility between males and females of the same age and educational group due to age differences between the sexes as to (1) age of proband at time of marriage, and (2) age of spouse in relation to age of proband. These differences in fertility would be the result of the slightly different ways by which changes in socioeconomic conditions at specific periods in time might affect fertility.
The discovery that the relationship between educational attainment and fertility is positive for males and negative for females in the population under study may be a very important finding. Dice, Clark, and Gilbert (1964) also found that the relationship between educational attainment and fertility was different for males as compared with females. Their investigation, based on a sample of the population of Ann Arbor in Michigan, is the only previous study which compares the age-specific fertility of males and females with respect to educational attainment and which includes both unmarried and married individuals of both sexes in the sample. These differences between the sexes with respect to the relationship between educational attainment and fertility, if widespread, would make any estimate of the relationship between educational a'ttainment and fertility for the total population based on data that excludes males (fertility data from U.S. Bureau of the Census for example) very unreliable.

Sex differences in fertility within educational attainment groups would be expected to decrease if assortative mating for educational attainment were increasing. Kiser (1965), however, found no evidence for an increase in assortative mating with respect to educational attainment with the possible exception of college graduates when comparing white women who had been married only once, husband present, aged 35-44 with a similar group of women aged 45-54 from the 1960 census.
An increase in assortative mating with respect to educational attainment for the college graduates should increase the fertility of female college graduates. U.S. Census data for 1960 indicate that the fertility of white female college graduates aged 35-54 is positively related to the number of years of schooling completed by the husband (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1964).
The relationship between intelligence and fertility is positive within each educational attainment group in addition to being positive for the total sample (Table 4). When the educational attainment groups were subdivided according to sex the relationship between intelligence and fertility was negative for females with 16 or more years of schooling and for males with 12-15 years of schooling (Table 4). However, neither of these negative relationships is significantly different from zero at the 5% level. It is difficult to interpret all of these relationships because most of the coefficients of regression and correlation are quite low. The one major exception to this appears to be the relationship between intelligence and fertility among male college graduates (r=+.375). This high correlation is especially encouraging from a eugenic point of view because the proportion of male college graduates is increasing in the general population.

Vol. 13, No. 4 Fertility and Educational Attainment

The absence of any comparable data from other studies makes it impossible to determine how widespread these relationships are. Additional studies have to be made before any generalizations can be made.
There is a wealth of data which indicates that the fertility of college graduates has been increasing (Cook, et al., 1955 and 1959; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1964). The data clearly indicate that the fertility of female college graduates has increased more rapidly than has the fertility of the rest of the female population. Such an increase in the fertility of female college graduates should strengthen the bimodal relationship between educational attainment and fertility for the general population if the relationship for males in the population remains rather constant. This should also have the effect of making the relationship between intelligence and fertility for the general population more eugenic.
The proportion of college graduates in the general population is increasing. This increase has been accompanied by a rise in the quality of college freshmen (Wolfle, 1954; Project Talent, 1965). This should make the relationship between educational attainment and fertility a more reliable index from a genetic standpoint.
Both the correlation coefficient between educational attainment and fertility (r=+.009) and the correlation coefficient between IQ and fertility (r=+.O46) are positive for the population under study, although neither are significantly different from 0 at the 5% level. However, when the population is grouped into 6-11 years, 12-15 years, and 16+ years with respect to educational attainment, the relationship between educational attainment and fertility appears to be negative. This is due

to the facts that (1) the relationship between IQ and fertility is positive within each of the three educational attainment groups; (2) fertility is not highly correlated with either educational attainment or IQ; and (3) the relationship between IQ and educational attainment is not one-to-one.
Any discussion concerning the genetic effect that a particular relationship between educational attainment and fertility might have must take differences with respect to generation length into account. Differences in generation length among different genotypes can bring about changes in gene frequencies as well as differences in fertility among different genotypes (Cole, 1954; Bajema, 1963). There is a positive relationship between educational attainment and generation length (Table 5). Since individuals with higher intelligence completed more years of schooling (Table 1), the differentials with respect to generation length have a dysgenic effect on the population under study. Data from other investigations (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1964; Conrad and Jones, 1932) indicate that differentials with respect to generation length have certainly had a dsygenic effect on intelligence for many years among the general population.
Differentials in generation length with respect to educational attainment in the total population under study make the bimodal relationship between educational attainment and total reproductive performance (combined effects of generation length and fertility) for the total population under study more negative and less bimodal than the positive bimodal relationship observed between educational attainment and fertility. For males in the population under study the differentials in generation length make the relationship between educational attainment and total reproductive per-

314

formance less positive and less bimodal than the positive bimodal relationship observed between male fertility and educational attainment. For females the differentials in generation length make the relationship between educational attainment and total reproductive performance more negative than if only differentials in fertility among females with respect to educational attainment are taken into account.
The relationships between intelligence and fertility and between educational attainment and fertility observed in the Kalamazoo population undoubtedly differ in certain respects from those which existed in previous generations, those which existed concurrently, and those which will occur in future generations. Therefore, it is desirable to conduct additional investigations of this nature to determine how widespread these relationships are and how they differ from one population to another in space or time. In order to assess the effects of socioeconomic conditions on the relationships observed in the population under study, a similar investigation needs to be made of a comparable population which differs with respect to age only. Such an investigation involving a population of native-born white individuals who took the Terman Group Intelligence Test while attending the sixth grade in the Kalamazoo Public School System, but who were born in 1921 or 1922 instead of 1916 or 1917, is being planned. These two populations should differ from each other primarily with respect to the age at which they were exposed to such socioeconomic conditions as the Great Depression, World War II, etc. The similarities and differences between the observed relationships in the two populations should provide an estimate of how these changes in

socioeconomic conditions affected the fertility of different age groups with respect to intelligence and educational attainment.
SUMMARY
This is a follow-up study of 957 native white individuals born in 1916 or 1917 and who took the Terman Group Intelligence Test in the sixth grade in the Kalamazoo Public School System. The data were divided into three educational attainment groups (6-11 years, 12-15 years, 16+ years) which were further subdivided according to sex.
The relationship between educational attainment and fertility is negative but not bimodal for the females and positive as well as bimodal for the males in the study. The strong bimodal nature of the positive relationship between educational attainment and fertility of the males in this study makes the over-all relationship for both sexes bimodal and slightly positive. These differences between the sexes with respect to the relationship between educational attainment and fertility observed in this study, if widespread in the general population, make any estimate of the relationship between educational attainment and fertility for the general population that is based on data that includes females only very unreliable.
The negative relationship between educational attainment and generation length for both sexes in this study makes the relationship between educational attainment and total reproductive performance (combined effects of fertility and generation length) more negative and less bimodal than the positive bimodal relationship observed between educational attainment and fertility.
The fact that the relationship between IQ and fertility as measured by correla-

tion andregression coefficients was positive for each of the three educational attainment groups as well asfor the total sample while the mean fertility of the three educational attainment groupswas negatively related to educational attainment indicates that the use of fertility data subdivided into the most widely used educational attainment categories (<12 years, 12-15 years, and 16+years) to estimate therelationship between IQ and fertility may lead to erroneous conclusions.
