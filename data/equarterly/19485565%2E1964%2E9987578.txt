FAMILY SIZE, STATUS AND MOBILITY: SOME ARGENTINE AND AMERICAN DATA

INTRODUCTION
For at least two decades it has been pointed out that Argentine fertility and related population characteristics are more like those of the United States and Western Europe than like those of most other Latin American countries (Bunge, 1940, Ch. II). The data available support this position and it has been generally accepted as being true (Smith, 1960, p. 16 et passim). However, prior to the Census of 1960, Argentina had taken only four censuses (1869, 1895, 1914, and 1947); and, as in many other countries, the reporting of vital statistics has been of uncertain accuracy. Also, in Argentina little information on family size is available and that available is not entirely comparable to data for the United States.
These facts encourage reporting of data on family size obtained in connection with a study of economic attitudes of students in the two countries. Though the number of respondents is not large, identical data were obtained from similar student populations in the two countries for two generations. Some striking similarities and differences are revealed.
Responses were secured from 417
 In the preparation of this paper we have received valuable comments from Jerry W. Combs, Jr., Paul C. Glick, Wilson H. Grabill, of the U. S. Bureau of the Census; and from Charles F. Westoff of Princeton University. The authors accept full responsibility for collection, analysis, and interpretation of the data. The senior author was Visiting Professor of Sociology at the University of Buenos Aires under a Smith-Mundt grant when the Argentine data were collected.

young male students who were in the last month of their senior year in four public preparatory schools in Buenos Aires.1 Two-thirds of them were of voting age (18) and most of the others were 17. In many respects they appeared to be more mature than high school students in the United States, and 94.5 per cent of them indicated that they expected to pursue further studies, for the most part in a university. Accordingly, it was clear that if we wanted a comparable group in the United States, we should take students of a college. Responses were secured from an identical number of male students in Introductory Sociology or Introductory Economics at the University of Tennessee.2 In Buenos Aires responses were secured in November 1957, and in Knoxville in November 1960. In both cities the questionnaire was personally administered and it ap-

The authors are indebted to Professor Gino Germani of the Institute de Sociologia of the University of Buenos Aires for assistance in planning the study. They are indebted to the students in the senior author's Seminar in Industrial Sociology for assistance in designing the questionnaire and to two students, Seflora Ana Maria Deigo and Sefiora Martha Bechis de Ameller, for assistance in administering the questionnaire.
2For some other aspects of the study it was regarded as desirable to have an equal number of responses from Tennessee students. Responses were originally secured from 497 male students. The number was reduced to 417 by eliminating the responses of all seniors (26), all students with class unspecified (30), and 24 juniors selected by use of a table of random numbers. The respondents reported on are 90 freshmen, 272 sophomores, and 55 juniors.

peared that answers were conscientiously given.
The median and modal age of the University of Tennessee students was a year greater than that of the Buenos Aires students. Comparison of the two groups is made with the realization that: (1) Buenos Aires students are not necessarily representative of Argentina; (2) University of Tennessee students arenot necessarily representative of the United States. With reference to treatment of the data, it should be pointed out that two types of comparison will be made: (1) comparison of size of father's family of origin with size of son's family of origin and with socially related factors within each sample; (2) comparison of each of these findings for the two countries. For the first type of comparison we are not interested in comparability of the two samples but in what they represent in each country. There is no reason to believe that they are unrepresentative of students of the two areas at the educational level under study. Applicability of findings to other areas or other educational levels will not be assumed. For the second type of comparison, that between the two countries, we face the problems faced by all studies which compare data from countries with different social and educational structures. Though not extensive or definitive, a study such as this does provide some insight into the facts of intergenerational change in family size and socio-cultural factors related to this change.
The questions asked relating to family size were: (1) Apart from himself, how many brothers and sisters did your father have? (Aparte de el, cuantos hermanos y hermanas tiene su padre en total?) (2) Apart from yourself, how many brothers and sisters do you have?

(Aparte de ud. mismo, cuantos hermanos y hermanas tiene en total?) To obtain our figures for family size, one (for the person reporting or for his father) was added to the figure reported in each case. Thus, for this study family size means number of children in the family; for both generations the data include only fertile couples. The decision regarding inclusion or exclusion of deceased siblings was left to the respondent. There is no reason to believe that this decision would differ systematically by country or status group in such a way as to influence comparison.
Most of the students in Buenos Aires and Tennessee were born about 1940, and we may assume that most of their fathers were born between 1900 and1920 with 1910as a likely median year. Thus, all of the fathers' families and almost all of the students' families are believed to have been completed. It is assumed that cases of incompleted families will not be so numerous or irregular in distribution as to bias the findings.

SIMILARITY IN FAMILY SIZE
Size of father's family of origin is indicated in Table 1. The distribution into the three sizes, small (one or two children), medium (three or four children), or large (five or more children) is so similar for the two countries that the

samples could easily have been drawn from the same population.
Distribution of respondents by size of their own families of origin differs somewhat for the two countries (Table 2). However, for both countries the changes between father's generation and student's generation are of the same nature and similar in proportion. First, in both samples there is a large increase in families with one or two children. (For the student's generation the proportion of such families is three times as great as for father's generation in Tennessee and almost four times as great in Buenos Aires.) Second, in both samples the proportion of families with three or four children remains about the same. Third, there is an impressive decrease in large families in both (a decrease of threefourths in Tennessee and even more in Buenos Aires). The major shift, then, in both countries is from families with five or more children to families with one or two children, with the proportion of three- or four-child families remaining approximately the same.

STATUS AND FAMILY SIZE
As an indication of status, we took occupations of fathers and divided these into three categories: High--executive, lives from investments, professional, military officer; Medium--manager,

foreman, office worker, non-commissioned military officer; Low--skilled and unskilled worker (Warner et al., 1949, p. 168). The three classes correspond to those which Germani designates as Clases altas, Autonomas (High); Clases medias, dependientes (Medium); Clases populares (Low) (Germani, 1955, p. 149). They agree in general with occupational ranking which has been found valid in the United States. Though no systematic study is available of the correlation between prestige of occupations in Argentina and the United States, the high correlations found for five other western countries lead us to believe that evaluations in most western countries are similar (Inkeles and Rossi, 1956).
In Buenos Aires our figures for the size of the father's family of origin do not indicate the inverse relationship to status which has been frequently observed in western countries. In fact, the relationship is the opposite, but it is not sufficiently strong to be accepted as significant. For Tennessee, however, the relationship is in the direction generally predicted and is significant at the .01 level (Table 3).
Similarly, for the size of the student's family of origin, the relationship is not in the direction generally predicted in Buenos Aires and is in the direction predicted in Tennessee. In neither case is the relationship strong enough to beaccepted as significant; however, the fact that the relationships are in opposite directions should be noted (Table 3).

A definite explanation of the changes and relationships mentioned cannot be offered on the basis of data available. However, we can suggest the possibility that theremarkably similar changes in family size in thetwo samples occurred in quite different ways.
In the United States, the usual pattern for males is marriage in their early twenties. Between 1910 and 1940 the estimated median ageat first marriagedecreased slightly (from 25.1 to 24.3 years) (Bogue, 1959, p. 215). With the decrease in ageat first marriage, an increase in

students were probably marrying. The data indicate that in 1936, 81.4 per cent of the males in Buenos Aires who contracted marriage were 25 years of ageor above (Germani, 1955, p. 42).
Argentina's neighbor, Uruguay, is known to be similar to Argentina ina number of population characteristics. Figures on age at marriage in Uruguay are available for 1942 and indicate also that there more than 80 per cent of the males are 25 years of ageor above at their marriage (Demographic Yearbook, 1960, Table 21, p. 586).

24.3, which would mean that less than 50 per cent of these males were 25 or above (Bogue, 1959, p. 215). However, the Argentine and Uruguayan figures include not only first marriages, but all marriages. Fortunately, figures are available on civil status of persons contracting marriage in Buenos Aires for 1944 and succeeding years. These reveal that less than 4 per cent of the males contracting marriage had been previously married (Informe Demographico de la Republica Argentina, 1956, p. 270). If we assume that the percentage was approximately the same for earlier years and that all the males who contracted a second marriage were 25 or above, we should subtract 4 per cent from the figure of approximately 80 per cent given above. Thus, it would appear that around 1940 approximately 76 per cent of Argentine males contracting first marriages were 25 or above, as compared with less than 50 per cent in the United States. Of course unions without recorded marriage exist in both countries, but these are probably not an important factor in fertility of families at the educational level under study.
These facts suggest that in Buenos Aires in the period around 1940 delayed marriage was probably significantly related to fertility. Unfortunately figures are not available to indicate whether age at marriage was lower around 1910 when the grandfathers were being married and when families were larger.
The negative relationships of fertility to status and mobility in the United States has often been explained as being due to more family size planning by higher status and upwardly mobile families. The positive relationship which appears to exist in Argentina could be due to the fact that higher status and upwardly mobile persons can afford to, and

consequently do, marry younger than lower status and stable or downwardly mobile persons. If these conditions do exist, they provide an explanation for a negative relationship of family size to status and mobility in the United States and a positive relationship in Argentina, as indicated by the figures summarized here.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The data presented reveal a remarkable similarity in family size and intergenerational reductions in family size. Data are not available to establish the mechanism or means by which the intergenerational reductions in family size were accomplished. However, the available facts indicate that family planning and not age at marriage is the explanation in the United States. For Argentina it is unlikely that family planning after marriage is as prevalent as in the United States and it is probable that age at marriage is a partial explanation.
When family size is related to occupational status and occupational mobility, the two samples are found to be quite different. In Tennessee family size is negatively related to status and mobility; in Buenos Aires the relationship to status and mobility is in the opposite direction. Most of the relationships are not strong enough to be regarded as significant, but the observation of an opposite direction in each case is noteworthy. If control of family size is accomplished by different means, as suggested, opposite direction of these relationships might be expected.
