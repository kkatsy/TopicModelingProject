ADDRESS OF HIS HOLINESS POPE PIUS XII*
Moral Questions of Genetics of the Blood
An address delivered in French to blood specialists attending the seventh congress of the International Society of Blood Transfusion in Rome by His Holiness Pope Pius XII on September 5, 1958. This address is of significancefor eugenics because couples with problems in heredity are advised to obtain information from such counseling services as the Dight Institute for Human Genetics. It is pointed out that the decision to have children is left up to the parents by the Dight Institute, which is not a clinic to repress fecundity.

The International Congress for Blood Transfusion, organized by the international association of the same name, gives Us the pleasure of receiving you, Gentlemen, and learning of your activities.
Following your meeting, the Seventh International Congress of Hematology will be held. We are aware of the increasing importance of problems concerning blood in contemporary society and the practical application of the conclusions and of the resolutions which you will adopt. We are also happy to show you Our esteem and to welcome you cordially.
In addition to the seriousness of the matters under consideration which you have called to Our attention, you know that the Church, whenever she can by her presence or by timely intervention either to do great good or avoid great harm, does not remain indifferent to the problems which concern the individual and the social, temporal and eternal aspects of human destiny.
Hematology, the science of blood and of its diseases, involves biology, physiology and medicine to the greatest degree. Blood is, in fact, in a certain sense, the center where the exchanges of organic life take

place. It carries oxygen and the elements which assure the nourishment of all the cells. At the same time, it insures the elimination of waste by the cells.
It was long considered that blood was intimately bound up with life itself which seemed to pour out with it through open wounds. Even today the expression "to give his blood" means a sacrifice that a man has made of his life for a cause which he believes worthy of this supreme offering and which, at times, is identified with the highest ideals that humanity can offer.
Since the participants of the coming hematological congress have asked Us to speak of certain moral questions which come under the domain of genetics of the blood, We intend to take up now the general aspects of these problems and thus prepare the answer that We shall give them. Therefore, We shall discuss here some of the biological aspects of the genetics of the blood and the problems they give rise to.
I. CERTAIN MEDICAL-BIOLOGICAL ASPECTS
OF THE GENETICS OF BLOOD
We have already had the opportunity to speak of the mechanism of heredity in Our address of September 7, 1953, to the first International Symposium of Medical Genetics (Discourses and Radio Messages, Vol. 15, p. 253 ff.) and to announce then the important principles applicable to

scientific data of genetics in its relation to moral and religious questions. At any rate, in order to clarify Our subsequent development, We must again touch on some recent discoveries of which you have kindly informed Us.
It is generally known today that the red blood corpuscles have their own nature and that the human race is divided into four blood groups (A-B-O-AB). If "antigene" means the ability to produce in an organism the formation of substances called "antibodies" which may unite with antigenes and bring on first the agglutination and later the destruction of the red corpuscles, one can explain the existence of the four groups in the following manner:
Groups A and B each possess an antigene of their own but not a corresponding antibody but (at the same time) each possesses the antibody of the antigene of the other group. The AB group possesses two antigenes but no antibody. The O group does not possess any antigene but it does possess the two antibodies.
During the past decades the discovery of other systems has introduced a considerable complexity in the exact determination of the types of human blood. But what interests Us mostly is the discovery of the "Rhesus" factor which accounts for the pathogenesis of the hemolytic illness of the newly born and which, until now, has been of unknown origin.
A mother who has "RH negative" will produce antibodies for "RH" positive globules and if the child she carries is "RH positive," she will harm it.
Since blood groups are inherited according to the mechanism of heredity following essentially the Mendelian law, it is evident that to have a "RH positive" child, the mother must have an "RH positive" husband. If he is the son of parents one of which is "RH positive" and the other of which is "RH negative," there will be a 50 percent probability of having "RH positive" children. But if the parents are both

"RH positive," all the children will also be "RH positive." "When an "RH negative" woman marries an "RH positive" man, she finds herself in what is called the 'RH situation," and in potential danger of having sickly children.
Side by side with the dangerous heredity, one can also consider the positive aspects of this heredity. Medical science is mainly interested in the harmful consequences and it is understandable that these are most strongly stressed.
Actually, examples are not lacking of very gifted families in which remarkable physical and psychological qualities have been transmitted from one generation to another.
May We be allowed to point out once again a particular case because of the importance it has in the Mediterranean area. It refers to two illnesses that are viewed separately from the clinical standpoint but are characterized by similar alterations of the blood system.
The first affects certain areas of the Italian population, all of the Greek population and all areas of the Mediterranean basin where Phoenician colonization left its mark.
A child is born apparently normal, but the doctor already notes in him signs of illness which more or less rapidly will lead to death, usually before his 10th year. His development will be notably retarded, his color pale, and he will have a protruding abdomen which denotes an enormous enlargement of the spleen which often almost completely fills the abdominal cavity. The most careful therapy can only prolong a life of suffering and discomfort, and in spite of innumerable blood transfusions which represent a very heavy expense for the family, the fatal outcome is inevitable.
At the time that Cooley and Lee succeeded in diagnosing exactly what this sickness was in the descendants of Italians who had emigrated to the United States, Rietti, Greppi and Micheli of Italy described a sickness that was apparently entirely dif-

I I . PROBLEMS OF THE GENETICS
OF THE BLOOD
The painful situation which We have described and other analogous ones met with in the domain of the genetics of the blood deserve special consideration in order to resolve the particularly serious problems of the psychic and moral order.

regard to the hereditary characteristics involved. If they decide not to have children their decision is "eugenic," that is to say that they will not propagate the defective genes by begetting either sick children or normal carriers.
If, as usually happens, the probabilities of begetting a child who is a carrier of the defect are less than they feared, it may be that they decide to have other children. This decision is "dysgenic" because they will propagate the defective strain instead of arresting its diffusion.

We must emphasize first of all the necessity of furnishing the public with the indispensable information about blood and its heredity so that individuals and families may be on the watch for terrible accidents. With this aim, information and consulting

duties as parents. From the moral standpoint it could be wished that these instances were more numerous.
The Dight Institute is often asked if there are relationships between consultation and religious duties (Ibid, pages 1516). In reality, genetic consultation is apart from religious principles.
Consultation does not answer parents who ask whether they should have more children and leaves the responsibility of the decision to the parents. Therefore, the Dight Institute is not a clinic to repress fecundity. It does not furnish information on how to "plan" families, for that question is not within the scope of their objectives.
The book from which We take these remarks emphasizes with force and precision the importance of the work that still remains to be accomplished in this field. "Death," it says, "is the price of ignorance of the genetics of the blood groups."
Fortunately, medical science has at its disposal at present enough knowledge to help men to fulfill with greater safety the desire, so intimate and so powerful among a good number of them, to have a happy family of healthy children.
If a couple is sterile, the doctor will try to induce fecundity. He will put them on their guard against dangers they do not suspect. He will help them to beget normal and well-built children.
Better informed on the problems which genetics bring up and on the seriousness of certain hereditary illnesses, men have today, more than in the past, the duty to keep in mind the conquests of medicine and to avoid for themselves and for others many physical and moral complications.
They must watch out for everything

which could cause lasting damage to their progeny and which could involve it in a series of interminable misfortunes.
Let Us recall that, in regard to this topic, blood relationships among people, both in the family and in the community, impose certain obligations. Although the formal elements of every human community are of a psychological and moral order, the progeny constitute the material basis which must be respected and preserved from harm.
What We could say about heredity could be applied in a wide sense to the communities which make up the human race. But the danger here comes more from an exaggerated insistence on the sense and value of the racial factor.
It is only too well known, alas, to what excesses pride of race and racial hate can lead. The Church has always been energetically opposed to attempts of genocide or practices arising from what is called the "color bar." She also disapproves of all genetic experiments which cheapen the spiritual nature of man and treats him as another type of the animal species.
We wish you, Gentlemen, to continue successfully your work so useful to the human community. A more lively awareness of the efficacious help which you bring to so many sick people will be added to the practical teachings of this congress. From this conviction you will draw more ardor for carrying out your daily tasks and the certainty of having deserved the respect and gratitude of those who owe their life and health to you.
In pledge of the Divine favors that We call down on you, We grant to you, your families and to all those dear to you, Our Apostolic Blessing.
