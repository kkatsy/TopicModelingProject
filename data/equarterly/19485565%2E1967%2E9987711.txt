INTRODUCTION
Stochastic process analyses, particularly Markov chain techniques, are finding increased application in the field of demography. Because of the stochastic nature of demographic events, such phenomena as fertility and migration can readily be studied by the use of these mathematical models. For example, Sheps and Perrin (1964a, b) have used stochastic techniques to study human reproduction, Chiang (1961; 1964) the competing risks of various types of illness and death, and Musham (1961), Markov chains to describe the effects of migration patterns. In a previous paper, McGinnis, Myers, and Pilger (1963) presented a model of internal migration that supplies desirable modifications to certain assumptions inherent in the Markov chain approach. At this time we are able to present some data that lend further support to the position previously taken that a more dynamic model is required to describe the migration of human populations through time.
The Markov Chain Model of Migration
Any sequence of random processes that is ordered in time and that has a common outcome set can be studied as a possible Markov Process (Parzen, 1962, Ch. 6). Letting the initial distribution, either of proportions or of probabilities, among a finite set of states (locations) be represented by a vector a0, it is possible

to predict, by the use of Markov theory, the distribution at time t, represented by the vector a{. This is accomplished by the simple application of a matrix of transition probabilities, P, to the initial vector a0- The accuracy with which one can predict distribution of a population among a system of states at some future time depends upon the degree to which the system obeys the Markovian constraints. Thus, one restriction of chain theory is that only the state of the system at time t determines the state of the system at time t + 1. That is, it is not necessary to consider the distribution among locations prior to time t when predicting the state of the system at time í + 1. The past history of the system is irrelevant, and only knowledge of at and P are sufficient to give au-i- A second constraint of Markov chain theory is that the matrix of transition probabilities is constant for each time interval of transition (i, t +1). That is, the probability that an individual will move from a state, say So at time t to state S¡ at t+1 is the same as the probability of transition from S¿ to Sj between times tn and fn+1 for all n = 0, 1, 2. . . . This property is called the axiom of stationarity. As we shall see, emergent patterns of migration indicate that the Markovian constraints may impose serious limitations on the applicability of such a chain model to a migration system. A modification of the stationary chain approach to a more dynamic model has been suggested that has the elegance of the chain approach, but which relaxes the Markov constraints.

Chain Theory and Some Empirical Patterns
Perhaps the most relevant work in which stationary Markov chain theory is applied to a large body of data is the study of industrial mobility by Blumen, Kogan, and McCarthy (1955). They found the chain model to be a poor approximation of the mobility process for the entire sample studied. In particular, the probability of an individual remaining in a given occupation was underestimated. This poor approximation led them to re-examine the data by dividing the sample into "movers" and "stayers" and applying different transition probabilities to each group. Other investigators also have considered the mover-stayer dichotomy in greater detail (Goodman, 1961). This dichotomy appears to imply a crude hypothesis to the effect that "movers" are less permanently attached to a given state (industry in the Blumen, Kogan and McCarthy case) than "stayers."
When migration data are examined a similar pattern seems to emerge. Goldstein (1958, pp. 82-97; 1964) found in both Norristown, Pennsylvania and Copenhagen, Denmark that a majority of individuals studied had never moved. In contrast, a majority of those who had moved had done so quite frequently. In their analysis of a 1958 sample of the entire United States population, Taeuber, Haenszel, and Sirkin (1961) suggested that a large portion of the total population has lived in the same place while a relatively large percentage of the mobile population could be characterized as "frequent migrants." These findings suggest that a distinction between movers and stayers may be quite important in characterizing the propensity for future movement. In short, persons with a past history of migration are more

likely to move in the future than persons without past migration experience. This pattern tends to violate the axioms of Markov chain theory discussed above; and, hence, suggests that a more dynamic stochastic model may be necessary for analysis of migration phenomena.
A DYNAMIC MODEL OF MIGRATION
The fundamental principle upon which rests the model presented by McGinnis and his associates (sometimes referred to as the Cornell Mobility Model) has come to be known as the axiom of cumulative inertia. Increased residence creates deeper ties to a location, and other things held constant, implies greater resistance to severing them. That is, accumulated residence seems to generate inertia. The longer a person remains in a given location, the lower should be the probability that he will leave it (Taeuber, 1961).
More formally, let 5={51( S2 Sn] be a finite and closed set of locations. Let P(V) be the conditional probability matrix of transition with typical elements pufty Then P(t) is the probability matrix that describes the migration probabilities for some homogeneous set over the set of locations in S between times t and t+l. In this sense, we interpret a probability distribution to be the proportional distribution of the elements of a closed population among the states of the system. Since proportions satisfy the axioms of probability, this creates no formal violation of the probability model. Now let the set of elements in each location at each point in time be subpartitioned with respect to duration of residence, which can be assumed to have unit value equal to that of time. Denote this variable d = l , 2, 3. . . . Each time specific matrix P(O can be broken down into an ordered sequence

The axiom has an immediate conse-

quence. Since âpu is strict monotone with I.u.b.= 1,

(2)

This means that, given sufficient residence, any location becomes an absorbing state; in death if by nothing else. Moreover, the typical element of the major transition matrix, py(i), is a weighted sum of the duration specific matrices. That is,

jt>- = 2 w- to- (3)

where ¿w, is the probability that an individual has resided in state S¡ for d units of time. The following axioms complete the system suggested by McGinnis and his associates:

aPt = aP

(5)
Axiom 4 parallels the Markov chain axiom of stationarity, but in duration of residence rather than in time. That is, rather than require that the transition matrix remain constant and equal across time for each duration group, Axiom 4 requires that this probability remain stationary for each specified residence group. Axiom 5 requires that the proportion of movers from a location Su who go to a particular location S¡, remain invariant in duration of residence in S{.
While the major purpose of this paper is to present empirical data for examining the axiom of cumulative inertia, we have described briefly the consequences of the axiom that enables the modified

transition matrix, Pm to assume a more dynamic form.
Transition probabilities may be interpreted as rates of migration since they are equal to the proportion of a given set of individuals who are migrants during a given time interval. Just as in stable population analysis, where the total mortality rate may change depending on the age-sex structure of the population, even though the schedule of agesex specific rates remains constant, the modified Markov process outlined above permits the transition matrix to change according to the duration of residence structure of the population. It may be noted that the same approach can be taken with respect to other population characteristics that have been demonstrated to be relevant, in addition to duration of residence, for producing differential rates of migration.
A TEST OF THE AXIOM OF CUMULATIVE
INERTIA
There are at least three characteristics that data should possess for an adequate test of the axiom of cumulative inertia. First, the data should allow duration of residence to be assigned to each resident at the beginning of the migration time interval. Second, a move should entail the dissolution of ties with the places of origin, and place the mover in the category of "newcomer" within the place of destination. That is, the move should be sufficiently distant so that a recent migrant has significantly less ties to his new location than does an older resident. Third, the unit of time selected as a single duration unit should be small enough so that a single duration of time resident does indeed have significantly less ties to his environment than a three or four duration of time resident. The scarcity of historical

migration data satisfying these conditions has not permitted wide scale testing of the axiom.
The data presented in the following analysis are migration histories inferred from school attendance items on a 1958 questionnaire administered to approximately 1,700 senior high school students attending public schools in Seattle,

Washington, and three suburban school districts. Only students for whom school attendance histories were completely reported have been used in the analysis.

Because data are restricted to families that had children attending high school in 1958,the number of migrants making longer distance moves is very small. For this reason, a move necessarily was defined as movement between high school attendance areas. It should be noted that this may not represent a type of move that entirely satisfies the criteria for data suitable in testing the axiom of cumulative inertia. The duration of residence prior to a move is by single years and would seem to be short enough to satisfy the general requirements. The data are presented in Table 1, and the probabilities of movement in three different years by various duration of residence classes are plotted in Figure 1.
Although the data are not ideal, they indicate a definite trend that tends to support the axiom of cumulative inertia. The probabilities of movement decline by increasing duration of residence for each year. It should be noted that the total rates also decline from 1955 to 1957. This seems to indicate that high school seniors are less likely to move than juniors, and juniors less likely than sophomores. Virtually none of the students were seniors in 1956 and juniors in 1955, as only high school students in the year 1958 were included in the study. We have not presented durationspecific transition matrices because of the small number of cases in each cell. According to Axiom, 5, however, we would expect the marginal probabilities to parallel the cell probabilities.
SUMMARY
The empirical evidence reported in this paper provides further support for the axiom of cumulative inertia. Not only is information on duration of residence an important element in any

study of migration, but it provides a necessary modification for the Markov chain approach to migration probabilities. Future studies of the mathematical model will require data that will satisfy the criteria stipulated in this paper and will be of sufficient quantity to assure reliable within-cell probabilities of movement. This should make it possible to control for such important factors as age, stage in the family life cycle, different places of residence, and other meaningful sociological characteristics. In summary, we can restate, as others have done, that individual histories of movement are important for the types of analysis that increasingly are coming to play a major role in migration research (Taeuber, 1966).
