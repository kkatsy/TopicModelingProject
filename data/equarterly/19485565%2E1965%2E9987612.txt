INTRODUCTION
A relationship between number of children and religious affiliation has been reported by many of the studies of differential reproduction made in the United States and in other countries. Local populations differ, however, in their fertility patterns. Changes in the pattern of family size, moreover, have been taking place in recent decades in many parts of the world (Westoff, 1954). Additional studies of the relation of fertility to religious affiliation in particular populations are consequently needed.
This report presents the results of a study of the relation of number of children to religious affiliation and to frequency of church attendance in the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan. The information on which the report is based was gathered in the years 1951 to 1954.
Previous reports dealing with the relation of fertility to body dimensions, to education, and to occupation and income in the population of Ann Arbor have been presented (Clark and Spuhler, 1959; Dice, et al., 1964a, 1964b).
THE SAMPLE
The data upon which this study is based were obtained from a two-stage random sample of the adult, resident

population of Ann Arbor (Dice, et al., 1964a). The sample consisted of 545 males aged 18 years or older and of 546 females 17 years or older.
Information was obtained about the current religious affiliation of 97.2% of the males and 96.7% of the females included in the sample. Information about church attendance was obtained for only the 327 males and 351 females who came to the Institute of Human Biology to be interviewed. For these, information about church attendance is complete except for one female.
METHODS
In the second and final stage of sampling, one-fourth of the married males, one-fourth of the married females, onehalf of the single males, and one-fourth of the single females were chosen at random from the adult residents of each of the primary sampling units selected at random for the study. A larger proportion of the single males than of the other categories were included in the sample because of the scarcity of single males in the population.
For calculating means, proportions, and coefficients, the overrepresentation of single males in the sample has been compensated for by using an adjusted sample obtained by adding one-half the number of single males to the number of married males in each category. No such adjustment is required for the females. For calculating chi-square and

analysis of variance, the unadjusted sample has been used.
The age classes represented in the sample are: 24 years and younger (-- 25), 25-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-70, and 70 years and older (70+). The overlap in ages at each end of the intermediate age classes is due to a difference in the codings for those who came to the Institute to be interviewed and those who did not. This overlap, however, should produce no serious bias in the statistical treatments.
The number of children reported for each person included in the sample comprises only those children who lived for 24 hours or longer and who were acknowledged by that person.
RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION
The current religious affiliation of 47% of the males and of 55% of the females in the adjusted sample was with various Protestant sects (Table 1).

Twelve per cent of the males and 13%of

the females were Methodists, and 12% of

both males and females were Lutherans.

The remainder of the Protestants were

members of Presbyterian, Episcopalian,

Evangelical and Reformed, Baptist, or

Congregational churches or belonged to

one of the sixteen smaller sects repre-

sented in the sample. Roman Catholics comprised 10% of the males1 and 12%

of the females in the adjusted sample.

Greek Catholics made up a little over

1% of both the males and the females.

Buddhists, Judeans, and Mohammedans

together comprised less than 1% of the

sample. Thirty-eight per cent of the

males and 29% of the females reported

themselves to have no religious affiliation.

A greater proportion of females than

of males in the population of Ann Arbor

are affiliated with a religious group. In

every age class, a greater percentage of

males than of females reported them-

selves not to be affiliated with any reli-

gious group.

RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION AND AGE
The statement sometimes is made that the people of the United States are becoming progressively less religious. On the other hand, reports are made that membership in certain churches is increasing. If variation should occur among the age classes of our sample in the proportion of persons who are affiliated with any particular church or with none at all, this might influence the overall estimates of the relation between fertility and church membership.
The percentages of persons who are reported to be affiliated with each of the major religious groups represented in the sample vary erratically among the age classes. No consistent trend in percentage of church membership is evident among the age classes, for either the males or the females (Table 2). Variation among the age classes in the proportion of persons not affiliated with any religious group, when tested by chisquare, is nonsignificant at the 5% level

for both the males (.95>P>.90) and the females (.50>P>.25).
Variation among the age classes in the proportion of persons with any particular religious affiliation or with none, therefore, probably does not affect in any important manner the fertility relations in the Ann Arbor population as a whole.
RELIGION AND EDUCATIONAL LEVEL
In order to compare the amount of education of the several religious groups in Ann Arbor, we have computed the means of the number of years of schooling of those males and females in the adjusted sample who were aged between 40 and 70 years (Table 3). By the age of 40 years practically all will have completed their education, including those who have continued their professional training after graduating from college. In these calculations we have used the methods described in our earlier paper dealing specifically with education (Dice, et al., 1964a).

Fertility and Religious Affiliation

The mean number of years of schooling for the males in the adjusted sample aged between 40 and 70 years is greater for the Roman Catholics (12.8 years) than for those without religious affiliation (12.2 years) or for Protestants (11.5 years). The differences in amount of schooling between these religious groups, however, are nonsignificant at the 5% level. The superiority of the Roman Catholic males in amount of schooling evidently is largely due to the greater proportion of Catholics (73%) who had completed high school, than of nonaffiliates (59%) or of Protestants (52%). A smaller proportion of Roman Catholics (24%), however, had graduated from college than of nonaffiliates (28%) or of Protestants (26%).
For the females in the sample aged between 40 and 70 years the mean number of years of schooling is 12.3 for those without religious affiliation, 12.1 years for Roman Catholics, and 11.1 years for Protestants (Table 3). Again, however, the differences in means between religious groups are nonsignificant at the 5% level. The proportion of females who had graduated from senior high school is considerably greater for Roman Catholics (75%) than for nonaffiliates (57%) or for Protestants (50%). The

proportion of females who had graduated from college, however, is greater for nonaffiliates (30%) than for Protestants (12%) or for Roman Catholics
Variation thus is indicated to occur among the three major religious groups in Ann Arbor in the proportions who had achieved certain levels of education. Roman Catholic males and females, for example, excel both Protestants and nonaffiliates in the proportion who had graduated from senior high school. On the other hand, the proportion of Roman Catholics who had graduated from college is smaller than for either of the two other major religious groups. In mean number of years of schooling per person, the three major religious groups exhibit no significant differences from one another.
RELIGION AND INCOME
The mean yearly income earned by males aged between 40 and 70 years and who were employed full time has been computed separately for each of the three major religious groups represented in the adjusted sample. For computing mean income we have used the approximate median of each of the income

classes coded in our questionnaire (Dice, et al., 1964b).
Protestant males have slightly higher mean incomes ($7,366) than Roman Catholic ($7,293) or nonaffiliated males ($7,124). The differences in mean income between these religious groups, however, are all nonsignificant at the 5% level.
The proportion of males earning $6,000 or more per year is higher for Roman Catholics (55%) than for Protestants or nonaffiliates (40% for both). The proportion earning $10,000 or more per year, however, is higher for Protestants (20%) than for Roman Catholics or nonaffiliates (14% for both).
No evidence is given by our sample, therefore, for any consistent or significant difference in yearly earned income among the major religious groups in Ann Arbor.
RELIGION AND OCCUPATION
For comparing the occupational levels of the major religious groups in Ann Arbor, only those males in the adjusted sample whowere employed full-time and who were aged between 40 and 70 years were included in the computations.
The number of fully employed Roman Catholic males in the adjusted sample

who were aged between 40 and 70 years is only 16.0 (Table 4). When these are divided into occupational classes, the numbers are too small for satisfactory statistical comparisons. The available numbers indicate, however, that a greater proportion of Roman Catholics than of Protestants or of nonaffiliates were engaged in clerical or sales occupations. The proportion of Roman Catholics who were engaged in professional or semiprofessional occupations (25%) also is high, being surpassed only by the nonaffiliates. Conversely, the proportion of Roman Catholics who were service workers or laborers is smaller than the proportion of either Protestants or nonaffiliates.
A greater proportion of nonaffiliates than of Protestants were engaged in professional or semi-professional occupations. The reverse relationship, however, is exhibited by the occupational class composed of proprietors, managers, and officials. In the other occupational classes the differences between the proportions of Protestants and of nonaffiliates are mostly small and exhibit no consistent pattern related to occupational rank. None of the differences are statistically significant.
These comparisons consequently indi-

cate that no significant relationship exists between any major religious group in Ann Arbor and a particular class or level of occupation. In particular, Roman Catholics are indicated not to be inferior in their occupational level to Protestants or to nonaffiliates.
FERTILITY AND RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION
For comparing the fertility of the major religious groups in Ann Arbor we shall omit from consideration the age classes below 30 years. The families of many of these younger persons would still be incomplete.
The Roman Catholic males in the sample have a slightly greater mean number of children than the Protestants or nonaffiliates in the 30-40 age class, but smaller means in the 40-50 and 5060 classes (Table 5). Only three Roman Catholic males are included in the 6070 and in the 70+ age classes, too few for dependable comparisons.
Among the females in the sample, the Roman Catholics have a greater mean number of children than the Protestants in the 40-50 age class, but smaller means in the 30-40, 50-60, and 70+ classes (Table 5). Only one Roman Catholic

female is included in the 60-70 age class of the sample. Compared to nonaffiliates, the Roman Catholic females have greater mean numbers of children in the 30-40, 40-50, and 70+ age classes, but a smaller mean number in the 50-60 class.
Protestants exhibit no consistent or significant difference in fertility from those persons without religious affiliation. The largest difference in mean number of children between these two religious groups is in the 50-60 age class. In this age class, however, Protestant males have a larger mean number of children than nonaffiliated males, but Protestant females have a smaller mean number of children than nonaffiliated females. Further, the difference in number of children between Protestants and nonaffiliates in the 50-60 age class, as tested by analysis of variance, is nonsignificant at the 5% level for both sexes (P>.10 for both).
Fertility thus appears not to be significantly related to religious affiliation in the Ann Arbor population as represented by a random sample taken in 1951-54. The means for the number of children per person of the Protestants do not differ consistently or significantly in the

several age classes from the corresponding means for those persons who have no religious affiliation. Nor do the means for the number of children of the Roman Catholics differ consistently among the age classes from the means of either the Protestants or the nonaffiliates.
CHURCH ATTENDANCE
Frequency of church attendance might be considered to measure amount of religious devotion more accurately than church membership. Numerous persons in the sample who were not members of any church nevertheless attended church with some regularity. Conversely, some church members attended church infrequently or not at all. It seems desirable, therefore, to compare frequency of church attendance with church affiliation and with fertility.
Record was made whether each person interviewed at the Institute of Human Biology never attended church or whether the number of his church attendances averaged 1-4 per year, 5-12 per year, 1-2 per month, 2-3 per month, 3-4 per month, or 4 or more per month. For computing the average frequency of

church attendance for each religious group and age class, we have used the minimum number of yearly church attendances reported by each person. Thus, for the category coded as 5-12 church attendances per year, we have used 5 times per year as the basis for computation. The frequency of church attendance reported in Table 6 represents, therefore, a minimum estimate.
Roman Catholics attended church more than twice as frequently on the average as Protestants. This is true both for males and for females and for almost all age classes (Table 6). Protestants, in turn, attended church more than twice as frequently on the average as those who were not affiliated with any church.
FERTILITY AND CHURCH ATTENDANCE
For comparing fertility with frequency of church attendance the coefficient of correlation is here used. The coefficients of correlation between number of children and minimum frequency of church attendance per year have been calculated, however, only for the 40-49, 50-59, and 60-69 age classes. The age classes below 40 years have not been used because of the incompleteness of the fam-

ilies at these younger ages. The 70+ age class is not used because of the small number of persons in the sample who were aged 70 years and older.
The coefficients of correlation between number of children and minimum frequency of church attendance for the males are --.115 for the 40-49 age class, -.057 for the 50-59 class, and +.114 for the 60-69 class. For the females the coefficients are +.027 for the 40-49 age class, --.126 for the 50-59 class, and -.022 for the 60-69 class. The coefficients thus are not consistent in direction among the age classes, either for the males or for the females. Moreover, the coefficients are small and all are nonsignificant at the 5% level (P> .10 for all comparisons). No significant relation between fertility and frequency of church attendance is exhibited, therefore, by our sample of the population of Ann Arbor.
DISCUSSION
The religious affiliation of 47% of the adult males and of 55% of the adult females resident in Ann Arbor during the years 1951-54 was with various Protestant sects. Ten percent of the males and 12% of the females were Roman Catholics. The number of Buddhists, Judeans, Mohammedans, and Greek Catholics were very small. Thirty-eight per cent of the males and 29% of the females in the sample were not affiliated with any church. The three major religious groups in Ann Arbor are consequently the Protestants, Roman Catholics, and nonaffiliates.
Variation in mean family size among religious groups has been reported by numerous previous studies. The family size of Roman Catholics, for example, has been reported to be greater in many communities than that of Protestants

(Holmes, 1936; Whelpton and Riser, 1943; Grabill, et al., 1958; Freedman, et al., 1959).
In Ann Arbor, however, no significant variation in family size in relation to religious affiliation is demonstrated by our sample. Protestants, Roman Catholics, and nonaffiliates exhibit no significant differences from one another in the mean number of their children. It is true that the number of Roman Catholics included in the sample is too few for fully satisfactory comparisons. Only 33 male and 45 female Roman Catholics aged 30 years or older are included in the adjusted sample (Table 5). These numbers are nevertheless sufficiently large that if any important difference in fertility between Roman Catholics and any other religious group had existed, this should have been indicated.
The absence in Ann Arbor of any significant differential of reproductive rate in relation to religious affiliation is further supported by comparison of the number of children of each person with the minimum average number of his yearly church attendances. Roman Catholics attended church more than twice as frequently on the average as Protestants. Protestants in turn attended church more than twice as frequently as nonaffiliates. The coefficients of correlations between minimum number of church attendances per year and number of children, however, are nonsignificant at the 5% level, for both the males and the females in the sample.
Economic and social position also has been reported to vary among the religious groups in some populations. Roman Catholics, for instance, have been reported to occupy a generally lower economic position in certain communities than Protestants (Lorimer and Osborn, 1934).

No important variation in economic position or social status, however, appears to occur among the religious groups in Ann Arbor. The three major religious groups in the city, composed of Protestants, Roman Catholics, and nonaffiliates, respectively, exibit no significant differences from one another in the levels of education achieved either by the males or by the females. Nor does the religious affiliation of the males have a significant relationship to their occupational class or to the amount of income they earn per year.
Religious affiliation consequently appears to have no significant relationship to socioeconomic position in the population of Ann Arbor. A relatively large proportion of the population is engaged in professional or semi-professional occupations, and the general level of income in the city is high. The proportion of unskilled laborers is very low, being only 2% of the males of all ages included in the sample (Dice, et al., 1964b).
Persons affiliated with each of the religious groups represented in the city and those with no religious affiliation at all associate freely together in the economic, social, and intellectual life of the city. All must be influenced to a considerable degree by similar ideals and ambitions in regard to the most desirable size of family. The absence of a significant variation in fertility among the major religious groups in Ann Arbor may consequently be the result of the large degree of similarity among the religious groups in levels of education, classes of occupation, and amounts of income earned per year.
The absence of a significant fertility differential among the major religious groups which is reported in this study applies, of course, only to the population of Ann Arbor and only to the years 1951

-54 when our sample was collected. The population of Ann Arbor differs from many other local populations in its large proportion of highly educated persons and in its small proportion of persons with very low incomes (Dice, et al., 1964a, 1964b). The fertility pattern in this city consequently cannot be expected to be representative of that of the population of the United States in general.
SUMMARY
From a random sample of the resident population of Ann Arbor, Michigan, taken in 1951-54, it is estimated that 47% of the males aged 18 years and older and 55% of the females aged 17 years and older were affiliated with various Protestant churches. Ten per cent of the males and 12% of the females were Roman Catholics. Slightly over 1% of both sexes were Greek Catholics. Buddhists, Judeans, and Mohammedans together comprised less than 1% of the population. No religious affiliation was reported by 38% of the males and by 29% of the females.
Roman Catholics attended church more than twice as frequently as Protestants. Protestants in turn attended church more than twice as frequently as those not affiliated with any church.
No significant relation between number of children and religious affiliation is indicated to exist in the population of Ann Arbor. Nor is there a significant relation between fertility and frequency of church attendance.
Level of education does not vary significantly among the major religious groups represented in Ann Arbor, either for the males or for the females in the 40-70 age group.
Class of occupation and amount of income earned per year by the males aged 40-70 years likewise does not vary

significantly among the major religious groups.
It is suggested that the absence of a differential in fertility among the major religious groups in Ann Arbor is theresult of the general similarity of these groups in their levels of education, classes of occupation, and amounts of earned income.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The information upon which this report is based was gathered by the Assortative Mating Study of the Institute of Human Biology, University of Michigan. Donald J. Hager prepared most of the socioeconomic questionnaires, and J. N. Spuhler wasin charge of field operations. The records are now in the custody of the Department of Human Genetics, and access to them has been provided by James V. Neel, Chairman of the Department. The collection of the information was supported by a generous grant tothe University of Michigan from an anonymous donor. The analysis of the infor-

mation has been aided by a grant to Cranbrook Institute of Science from the American Eugenics Society.
