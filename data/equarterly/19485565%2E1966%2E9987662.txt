A NOTE ONTHE GENETICS OF "SCHIZOPHRENIA"
ARNOLD R. KAPLAN
Laboratory of Medical Genetics Cleveland Psychiatric Institute
Cleveland, Ohio

John D.Rainer (personal communication, 1965) hasbrought to my attention a possible butunintended interpretation of remarks included in my recent article (Kaplan, 1965) discussing the literature on the genetics of "schizophrenia." My comments included the statement, "Kallmann (1953) hasregarded family history as being of primary importance to accurate diagnosis of schizophrenia." The context of this statement involved my discussion of inconsistent concepts and observations between some leadingpsychiatric writers. These included discussions and reports reviewed in Kallmann's (1953) text, and Jackson's (1960,1964) criticisms of same. Rainer pointed out that my comment might be interpreted as theimplication byme that the family and twin studies described in Kallmann's text involved deliberate structural bias. He also pointed outthat Kallmann took great care to describe the methods that he designed tospecifically avoid any such bias in collecting his data.
My remarks were not intended to imply anydeliberate bias in the studies of Kallmann nor any of the other writers with whom his observations agreed or disagreed. I attempted to cite several examples of inconsistent conclusions by different writers and to relate the inconsistencies to reports by Mehlman (1952) and others whohave demonstrated the unreliability and inconsistency of di-

agnostic distributions reported by different psychiatric diagnosticians.
Different approaches and sampling procedures by Kallmann and his associates, compared with several other investigators, have provided different results (Rosenthal, 1964). The observations reported by Rosenthal (1961, 1962,1964), Tienari (1963), and Kringlen (1964a, 1964b) have described twin concordance rates that differ markedly from those previously reported by Kallmann (1946, 1953), Slater (1953), Essen-Möller (1941), and Luxenburger (1930). The reported inconsistencies emphasize the unsolved problems regarding psychiatric diagnosis, as well as biological studies that are tied to the symptom-oriented diagnosticsystems.
