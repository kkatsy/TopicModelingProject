INTRODUCTION
THE RATES of sex-linked color vision deficiency in nine areas of Great Britain reveal over-all heterogeneity and two distinct geographical clines, one grading from low rates all along the east coast to higher rates toward the west, the other, from low rates in Scotland and the North of England to progressively higher rates southwards (Kherubian and Pickford, 1959). The former cline has been associated with the invaders of the east coast during the early centuries of the Christian era (Pickford, 1959, p. 31). The latter has been tentatively attributed to the progressively longer histories of agriculture and settled habitat encountered from north to south, under the hypothesis that the intensity of natural selection against color vision defects became steadily more relaxed with the growth and diffusion of nonhunting cultures (Post, 1962).
Rates of "colorblindness" among geographic subdivisions of France and Japan show over-all homogeneity. Nevertheless, the French rates are markedly higher along both coasts and rather lower in two areas of inhospitable mountains, compared with the national average (Kherubian and Pickford, 1959). In Japan, one small area of high rate is reported (Post, 1962, p. 136).
The present endeavor aims to review the distribution of pooled protan and

deuteran rates among males within these three countries--the only parts of the world for which prevalence rates have been reported by relatively small geographical subdivisions--and to comment briefly on their histories of nonhunting culture-habitats, as a further test of the hypothesis that relaxed selection has played a role in the moulding of the distribution patterns.
GREAT BRITAIN
The British data stem from examinations by a modified Ishihara-Stilling test of 123,414 Royal Navy recruits at 77 centers. They were first reported as grouped into nine geographical areas, corrected for regional variation of intelligence, by Vernon and Straker (1943). These authors later transmitted detailed figures for each center by private communication to Kherubian and Pickford, who published them (1959). They are presented in Table 1, rearranged into five areas to enhance their homogeneity, and illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. The five new aieas are defined quite arbitrarily, as were the nine of Vernon and Straker.
The over-all distribution pattern of Britain is nicely summarized by Kherubian and Pickford (1959, pp. 69-72), who observe the extreme heterogeneity of the 77 recruiting centers (X2{76) = 330, p <0.001), the extreme hetero-

homogeneity and these would be homogeneous if the most aberrant center of each were removed--and finally, the two clines. These are quite clear even without rearrangement. Gradation southwards from Scotland is apparent along both the east and the west coasts; gradation from east to west is apparent whether in Scotland, the midlands, or along the south coast.
Both clines are significant statistically. The 77 rates of "colorblindness," each weighted by the reciprocal of its variance (N/pq where N is the number of men tested, q the rate of "colorblindness" and p = 1-q), are found to have a regression upon latitude of minus 0.118 and simultaneously upon longitude of plus 0.477. (Latitude is measured in degrees aiorth of 50° N. Because of the slant of the east coast, longitude is measured in degrees from this coast instead of from a single meridian such as that of Green·wich). Although the variation removed by the regression is highly significant there is also considerable residual variation. This may be attributed to fortuitous fluctuation resulting from such iactors as wars, epidemics, immigration, ·emigration, etc.; perhaps also, under the present hypothesis, to such factors as the ·differential survival of hunting populations, variation in local occupations and ·other results of the uneven diffusion of culture.
Each center's rate of "colorblindness" ·can be predicted by correcting the national rate of .0725 by the center's latitude and longtitude, as above defined, ·employing the corresponding regression coefficient. The difference between each reported rate and predicted rate is noted in the last column of Table 1, a plus value indicating that the former is higher, and vice versa. The smaller the difference, regardless of sign, the better the prediction. While no region of Britain

seems to have a marked excess of good predictions over bad, the London region seems characterized by rather bad predictions, all of them being too low, and the southwest of England by extremely bad ones, all but two being too high. (In order to balance the plus differences with the minus differences in the last column of Table 1, each difference must be multiplied by the number of men tested).
The first cline may be tentatively explained under the relaxation hypothesis by British history and pre-history. At any given time from the earliest Neolithic to the modern era, there have been "clines" from north to south in those aspects of culture which may be presumed to have offered occupations other than hunting, and thus produced a decrease in the rigor of natural selection against color vision defects (Neel and Post, 1963). In general, the transitions from hunting culture-habitats commenced in the south by repeated cultural invasions from the continent which diffused northwards, as did successive waves of improvements in agriculture and domestic industries, followed by various steps in the growth of urban life. This process may be logically considered to have permitted progressively larger proportions of the population to escape the more intensive natural selection of earlier culture-habitats with respect to "colorblindness."
The east-west cline may be explained similarly, in so far as the various waves of invaders landing along the east coast had shorter histories of culture-habitats productive of relaxed selection than the older inhabitants of Britain whom they displaced (Pickford, 1959, p. 31). The fairer coloration of the invaders' skin and hair may have been incidental. They plundered, looted, and later colonized precisely because of the wealth and pros-

perity of these older inhabitants, whose descendants in the west give testimony today of their longer histories of more "advanced" culture, by their higher rates.
Alternative explanations of the geographical distribution of "colorblindness" rates have been sought in vain. No aspect of human ecology has been found which might appear to have affected natural selection for this trait. A suggestion arises from the mild positive association between "colorblindness" and the density of horses and cattle. The fit is insufficiently exact to warrant much consideration, but since it is possible that animal densities today may provide some clue of what they were during prehistoric periods, which in turn might indicate human population densities, this association might be taken tentatively as additional indication of selection relaxation. The point will be noted again for France.
The distribution of defective vision acuity in Britain resembles that of "colorblindness" in one area only, Scotland, where each rate is lower than its national average. The resemblance fails elsewhere--defective acuity rates are higher than average in the Northwest of England where "colorblindness" is lower, whereas in Cornwall, Devonshire, and Wales defective acuity is lower than average and "colorblindness" higher. In general the higher rates of acuity defects are associated with urbanization and industrialization, bearing no resemblance to either of the clines found in "colorblindness" distribution (Martin, 1949).
FRANCE
The French data (Kherubian and Pickford, 1959) are from tests by Ishihara plates of 6,635 male students in Paris. Originally classified by the Département

of the mother's birth, they were condensed into 48 units by pooling certain adjacent Départements, and are thus presented in Table 2. The distribution of frequencies is in marked contrast with that of Great Britain, being characterized by a considerably higher national average, an over-all homogeneity -- X2(47) = S9, p =s 0.5--and no evidence of clines. Twelve of the 48 rates lie within the central range of two standard deviations above and below the national average of .0943, i.e. between .0869 and .1017.
Two regions of higher rates are evident, one along the Channel and Atlantic coasts, another along the Mediterranean. In the former the highest units are Pas-de-Calais, two units in Normandy and three along the Loire, but by lowering the definition of "highest" one may include Brittany and other coastal units to make the northern region continuous. The southern region consists of a thin strip along the entire Mediterranean littoral with a northerly extension along the border of Italy up into

Savoy as far as Lake Geneva. Two large regions of lower rates are noted, and one smaller region (Figures 3,4). While the bounds of all five regions are arbitrary, the considerations which follow are sufficiently generalized to apply within somewhat generous margins.
A more serious consideration is whether such differentiation of regions may be due merely to the fortuitous fluctuation of small numbers, as noted by Kherubian and Pickford (1959, p. 51). By pooling the three areas, Pas-de-Calais, Normandy and the Loire Valley into a "Tripartite Northern Littoral" region, the average rate (.131) is found to differ from that of the "Remainder of France" (.101) by a margin hardly within the limits of significance, giving weight to the number of men tested (the difference of .030 is hardly twice its standard error,

appreciably from the whole of France (,037±-016), as do all five of the regions. Each region, furthermore, is homogeneous within itself respecting the Départements which compose it, as shown by the Chi squares in Table 2. All of the units in the two regions of higher rate fall above the central range (from .0869 to .1017) and all those in the three regions of lower rate fall below it, most of them by a wide margin. Of the 23 units composing the "Remainder of France," 11 fall within the central range and 12 fall outside it.
The most salient observation to be made from the distribution of the five regions is the coincidence of higher rates with agronomic prosperity, and of lower rates with rather barren hills or mountains, mostly of scrublands or forests, where living standards as far as these may be derived from the soil--exclusive of modern industry and commerce in towns and cities--are relatively depressed. Pasde-Calais and the Loire Valley enjoy first class soils with highest agricultural production, while Normandy contains a

large proportion of the best cattle lands of France. The Mediterranean littoral is distinguished for specialized crops, market gardening and fruits, although the northerly extension of high "colorblindness" rates into Savoy is relatively unproductive and departs from the present generalization. The regions of lower rates present considerable contrasts from this situation, the largest occupying the inhospitable Vosges and Jura mountains, the second largest the stern "Massif Central." Most of both regions have poor soils and low agronomic productivity. The third region of low rates, north of and parallel with the Loire, is characterized by merely moderate to poor yields of crops. Further comparisons in other parts of France indicate a fairly consistent association between "colorblindness" rate and one form or another of agronomic productivity, including within this term both meat and dairy cattle, horses, fruits and particularly viniculture. The only serious departure is the high rate in mountainous Savoy.
Comparisons between "colorblindness" and areas of Neolithic settlement are, at first sight, unrewarding. Neolithic cultures reached France by sea along both coasts as well as overland, and sites are fairly widely scattered. No studies of population densities have been found, whether of early or of later periods. Opinions are divided as to whether Neolithic settlers sought the best soils, some authorities believing that they first cleared the forests from the lighter soils where the vegetation was less formidable. Since there is clearly room for speculation, the following points are suggested, which would appear reasonable although they cannot be proven. First, the earlier Neolithic settlements need not concern us particularly, in the present considerations, since population numbers were very small and the upheavals of later

migrations, wars, and pestilences were profound. Second, the somewhat denser populations of the later Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age were characteristically established on the more productive lands. These included all seacoast since fish were far more abundant then than now. Thirdly, hunting cultures and quasi-hunting cultures continued at least up to the dawn of history, according to Roman reports, and were rather definitely associated with marginal lands, such as the forested hills and mountains which characterize the two larger regions of lower rates. Indeed, the populace of these regions lead relatively out-of-door lives even today, outside of the larger towns, such as of shepherds and woodsmen, who might be expected to be somewhat penalized if "colorblind" (Neel and Post, 1963). Thus, on the whole, it may be seriously suggested that agronomic productivity and "colorblindness" may have gone hand in hand, the former producing the latter through a relaxation in natural selection with cultural advancement.
The region which departs most widely from this association is the Mediterranean littoral, where forested mountains press down fairly close to the sea, yet "colorblindness" rates are very high. Several explanations are offered for this. The population of this region is relatively dense on the fertile coastal strip and correspondingly sparse in the mountains. Because of this density and of the protection by mountains and sea, this population has been relatively stable. The coastal mountains are more productive than those of the interior, and formerly were irrigated. The entire littoral has always had an important fishing industry. Finally, and most important, it received not only the Neolithic substantially earlier and more broadly than did most of France, but likewise every

succeeding wave of higher culture-- Chalcolithic, Cretan, Greek and Roman --all of which flourished here more than in any other region.
JAPAN
The Japanese data come from the Ministry of Education, Department of Athletics, made by Ishihara Tests of 249,014 male and 166,952 female students. They were reported by Sato (1935, pp. 2229-2230) for 24 Prefectures in 11 Districts. Since they were reviewed in Eugenics Quarterly, September 1962, pp. 145-146, they need not be repeated here.
The rates are remarkably homogeneous, with a range of only .007 from lowest to highest, i.e., .036 to .043. Chi square for homogeneity (23) is 16, p s 0.4. Sixteen of the 24 Prefectures lie within the central range from .0386 to .0402 of two standard deviations below and above the national mean of .0394. No rate differs significantly from another nor from the national mean, except that of the southern part of the Island of Sado, with .074. Various groups or combinations of mutually adjacent Prefectures having low rates have been compared with other groups having high rates, but in no case other than that of Sado is there a difference of note. Even the lowest rate, that of two adjacent Prefectures on the Island of Shikoku with .036, differs from the highest, the Prefecture of Ishikawa on Honshu, with .043, by an amount which is barely significant.
A more logical comparison might be that between Shikoku and the entire District of Chubu in central Honshu, since the Japanese Districts are of ancient date and therefore may have more biological significance than the Prefectures. The former has the highest and

the latter the lowest rate of any District, respectively .0360 and .0403, but the difference is not significant.
This homogeneity is consistent with both the late date of the introduction of Neolithic cultures, which arrived from the mainland about 500 B. C, and their advanced development, which caused relatively widespread and rapid diffusion. The successive cultural advances of the metal ages also diffused rather broadly and rapidly, perhaps for the same reason. Thus, one would not expect to find evidence of late survival of large isolates of hunting cultures in Japan, such as may explain the two large regions of low rates of "colorblindness" in France. The one region of remarkably high rate, on Sado Island, points suggestively towards the mainland where prevalence rates are considerably higher.
The means of the five Chinese samples aggregating 53,455 males found in the literature, and recently reviewed in Eugenics Quarterly (1962, p. 135), are .050, .050, .056, .063 and .069. Sample sizes are all over 1,000. A sixth sample, totaling some 13,700 for both sexes, averages .0588 among males and .0041 among females (Liang et al. 1959) .These means from China are consistently greater than those from Japan. In the seven Japanese series, from authors other than Sato, reviewed in 1962 (ref. supra) the means are .031, .035, .048, .049, .050, .051 and .074 with an over-all mean of .0465 for the total number 11,570 males. For all 31 Japanese samples, including those of Sato and aggregating 260,284 tested males, the mean rate is .0397.
In view of the longer histories of Neolithic and metal age cultures of China, the higher rates on the mainland as compared with Japan give added support to the selection relaxation hypothesis. The contrast between China

and Japan israther strikingly paralleled by the contrast between France and Great Britain, in both cases the mainland country having higher rates of "colorblindness" and longer histories ofrelatively widespread anddense Neolithic populations, than the neighboring insular country.
SUMMARY
The geographical distribution of estimates of rates of sex-linked color vision defects arepresented for subdivisionsof Great Britain, France, and Japan, among males, pooling deuterans with protans. Certain aspects of the distributions are indicated with reference to the length of time deemed to have elapsed since the population relinquished hunting culture-habitats. The positive association in these countries, between "colorblindness" and such elapsed time, is considered as evidence for the relaxation hypothesis.
