INTERMARRIAGE AND RACIAL AMALGAMATION IN THE UNITED STATES

Within the last few years tremendous popular interest has been aroused in the subject of Negro-white intermarriage. Fifteen years ago Negro protest leaders claimed they were interested only in jobs and votes and consequently down-played talk of intermarriage. Moreover, conservative whites were comforted by Gunnar Myrdal's report that although the ban on intermarriage was for them the most important aspect of the caste system, Negroes considered it the least important of the various discriminations they were forced to suffer. Very recently, however, the attitude on the part of many Negro leaders toward intermarriage has changed. Increasingly, such leaders, particularly the younger ones, are saying, "Why not?"
Earlier, most Negro thinking tended to isolate political and economic discriminations from the social discriminations symbolized, par excellence, by white attitudes toward racial intermarriage. However, in the writer's opinion, such thinking represented faulty sociological analysis. A more thorough view of the situation reveals that restrictions on racial intermarriage may well be closely linked to the economic discrimination that Negroes in our society must endure. Davis (1949) has listed the main social functions of the family as the reproduction, maintenance, placement, and socialization of the young. Let us focus our attention on the placement function of the family in the contemporary United States, i.e. on the con-

sequences which birth into a given family has for the youngster's future social position. Let us first remember that the transfer of wealth in our society is largely accomplished by bequeathal from one family member to another. The possession of wealth in our society not only entitles one to receive regular monetary interest; it is also a source of power, credit, and prestige. Secondly, it must be recognized that although universalism is the predominant criterion for the matching of job applicants to job vacancies in our society, particularism is quite important for many segments of it. In particular, in the building trades, jobs cannot be obtained without admittance to the union's apprenticeship program and in many instances it is almost impossible to obtain entree into the apprenticeship program unless one is a son or other close relative of a union member. Third, social science research has established that entree to elite positions in our society is most easily obtained by those who grow up from birth in a family having relatively high status. Birth in a high status family, of course, provides the financial means for obtaining advanced education. In addition, however, it is invaluable for giving one a sense of familiarity with the activities and functioning of high status society. This familiarity not only reduces the fear of interpersonal contacts in such a society but also increases the motivation to become a full participant.

In summary, being born into one family rather than another is a very important determinant of one's eventual social status. How may this fact affect the relative status of Negroes and whites in our society? Consider first our pattern of familial inheritance. On a per capita basis white persons hold a far higher share of the nation's wealth than do Negroes. The formal and informal prohibitions on intermarriage serve to perpetuate this pattern of inequality since they make it unlikely for any Negro to inherit wealth from any white person. Secondly, Negroes are by and large excluded from those jobs to which entrance is strongly determined by particularistic factors. This occurs simply because the existing jobs are usually held only by whites. Third, the lack of close relatives among whites prevents many Negroes from having an easy familiarity with the terrain of the social world of white persons and hence makes them afraid to apply for jobs demanding such familiarity even when their technical qualifications are completely satisfactory.
Thus, it is apparent that increased mixing of white and Negro stocks might have a significant effect on the socioeconomic position of Negroes in American society. What insight can then be given concerning the length of time that might elapse before substantial mixing of white and Negro stocks in this country could occur?
We shall not pretend that it is possible to predict the time period which would be required to achieve an amalgamation of the white and Negro races in this country. Demographers have learned from painful experience that the future cannot often be predicted. However, we can create certain plausible sets of assumptions about future trends in Negro-white intermarriage in the

United States. We can then spell out for any given time period the arithmetic consequences for racial amalgamation inherent in each of these sets of assumptions. Such a delineation of the arithmetic consequences over time of given set of assumptions demographers term a projection. The more uncertainty exists concerning which of the possible sets of assumptions is apt to be most valid, the more advisable it is to prepare a large number of projections so that the consequences of many different sets of assumptions can be tested. However, the value of projections does not necessarily lie in their predictive power. They can also be useful tools for planned social change. If it became a national goal to achieve racial amalgamation within a given period of time, projections could show what the future course of interracial marriage would have to be to achieve that goal. Conversely, for someone with an interest in a particular set of assumptions concerning interracial marriage, the projections tell the consequences for racial amalgamation inherent therein.
In this paper we propose twelve separate sets of assumptions concerning trends in the incidence of Negro-white intermarriage in this country and go on to examine the effect which each of these sets of assumptions would have on the composition by race of the United States population at given time periods in the future.
METHOD
The general model for all of our projections may be described as follows. First, we assume that all marriages occur on a periodic but discontinuous basis every generation. That is to say, we assume that at the beginning of the time period covered by the model every-

erations later, etc. Second, we assume that all Americans can be classified either as white or Negro. There is very little error in this assumption since less than one percent of the United States population is not currently classified as either white or Negro. Third, we assume that all children of a Negrowhite marriage will be socially defined to be Negro. This assumption is in keeping with current American law and also the practice of the U.S. Bureau of the Census in conducting the decennial census. Note, however, that over time the physical difference between the socially defined white and Negro groups will become increasingly small. Fourth, we assume that the number of children per married couple is identical for white, Negro, andmixed couples. A consequence of these assumptions is that the racial composition of the United States population becomes a simple function of the proportion of whites who marry Negroes. In symbolic form our model is as follows:

A(g), theproportion of whites who marry Negroes in any given generation. In a previous paper we have shown that for the counties of California, the proportion of whites who marry Negroes is highly associated (r = .85) with the proportion of all brides andgrooms whoare Negro (Heer, 1966). In California, the larger the proportion of Negroes among all brides and grooms, the greater isthe proportion of whites who marry Negroes. In other words the sheer availability of marriage partners of Negro race is apparently an important factor in the proportion of whites who marry outside their own race. In this study we shall assume for all 12of our projections that this principle holds true not only on a spatial basis for California, but also for the United States on a temporal basis. That is,weshall assume that as the proportion of Negroes among all bridesand grooms in the United States increases over time, there will be a corresponding increase in theproportion of whites who marry Negroes. To include this assump-

where

tion into our model we must introduce a concept which weused in our previous paper. This concept, which we term

W(g)= the proportion of theUnited here R(g), is the ratio of the actual pro-

actual proportion of whites who marry Negroes. In symbolic form:
The general model for all of our projections can now be stated as follows:
W(g+\) = W(g) x {1-R(g) x [1 -
It is now appropriate for us to discuss R(g) in more detail. We assume that R(g) is a product of two additional concepts. The first of these is R(O), the ratio of actual to expected interracial marriage at the beginning of our model, and the second is Y(g), a function of the number of generations since the beginning of the model. The complete symbolic description of the general method for each of our twelve projections can now be described as follows:
W(g+ l) = W(g)x{l- Y(g) xR(O)
The twelve projections differ among themselves only in their values of Y(g) and R(O).
Let us first discuss the values of R(O) assumed for the projections. If our projections are to have any value, the values of R(O) which we assume should be at least roughly congruent with current reality. Therefore, we must base them on knowledge concerning the current state of Negro-white intermarriage in this country. Unfortunately, data on this subject are very incomplete. At the present time there are 31 states in which marriage between whites and Negroes is legal. However, in only four states are there any recent published records concerning them. For the period from 1950 to the present, the only data on Negrowhite marriage tabulated by state offices of vital statistics are as follows: California, for 1955, 1957, 1958 and 1959; Hawaii, for each year from 1956 to 1964; Michigan, for each year from 1953 to 1963; Nebraska for each year from 1961

to 1964. Table 1 shows for each of these four states during the above mentioned years: (1) the actual percentage of whites intermarrying Negroes (the A(g) values), (2) the ratio of the actual proportion of whites marrying Negroes to the proportion expected if marriages were at random (the R(g) values). Table 1 also shows data on marriages between whites and nonwhites (i.e., Negroes, Indians, Japanese, Chinese, Filipinos, etc.) for the 33 states of the United States Marriage Registration Area in 1960 (United States Public Health Service, 1960).

Our problem now becomes one of estimating what the current ratio of actual to expected Negro-white intermarriage might be for the United States. From Column 2, Table 1, we see that the ratio of actual to expected Negro-white intermarriage is extremely high in Hawaii relative to the other three states. Moreover, we see the ratio in California is more than double the ratio in Michigan. Nebraska's 1964 ratio is less than half

that of Michigan in 1963. We should expect that the 19 states in which intermarriage is illegal would have Negro-white rates close to 0. Of necessity somewhat arbitrarily, we have based our projections on the assumption that the national ratio of actual to expected Negrowhite intermarriage is represented more closely by the ratios for Michigan than by the ratios for the other three states shown in Table 2. Our reasoning was

as follows. Let us assume that the range of the ratios for large nonsouthern states is approximated by the California and Michigan ratios. Then, since the southern states and at least one nonsouthern state (i.e., Nebraska) have ratios equal to or close to 0, the ratio for the nation as a whole should be somewhere closer to the lower end of the range for large nonsouthern states than the higher end. Thus, the national ratio might be approximately similar to the ratios for the State of Michigan. These ratios for the State of Michigan range in size from .008 (that for 1953) to .017 (that for 1963). All of the ratios for the State of Michigan, presumed to approximate the national ratio of actual to expected Negro-white marriage, are considerably lower than the 1960 ratio of actual to expected white-nonwhite marriage for the United States Marriage Registration Area. This too is to be expected. The proportion of whites marrying nonwhites in the United States is no doubt considerably

higher than the proportion of whites marrying Negroes. For example, in Michigan in 1962 the ratio of actual to expected white-nonwhite marriage was .021, considerably higher than the ratio of actual to expected Negro-white marriage for that state in 1962 (.013) and very close to the ratio of actual to expected white-nonwhite marriage for the United States Marriage Registration Area in 1960(.023).
Because there is uncertainty concerning the national ratio, we have decided to base half of our projections on one somewhat arbitrary assumption concerning this national ratio and the other half on a second, again arbitrary, assumption. Our first, more liberal, assumption is that the current national ratio is equal to the ratio for the State of Michigan in 1963; namely, .017. Our second assumption is that the current national ratio is equal to Michigan's 1953 ratio, namely, .008. Thus for six of our projections the value of R(O) will be .008; for the remaining

six .017. For each set of projections with a constant value of R(O) we shall make six assumptions concerning Y(g).
The most conservative of our six assumptions concerning Y(g) is that Y(g) equals one. The five remaining assumptions all presume that Y(g) is greater than one. The two most conservative of these remaining assumptions suppose that F(g) is a function of the changing color complexion of the socially defined Negro group. Each presumes that the willingness of whites to marry Negroes (as measured by the ratio of actual to expected intermarriage) will increase as the amount of white blood in the socially defined Negro group increases. This is a plausible assumption since human beings are probably more apt to enter close relationships with people who are not too dissimilar from themselves than they are with people who are quite dissimilar. The more restrictive of these two conservative assumptions supposes that Y(g) is equal to the ratio of the proportion of Negroes among total brides and grooms at generation g to the proportion of Negroes among all brides and grooms at generation O. Since the proportion of Negroes among all brides and grooms at the current time is around .110, Y(g) is presumed equivalent to
.110 The second and more liberal of these assumptions presumes that
The remaining three assumptions for Y(g) suppose that whites will find interracial marriage increasingly acceptable over and above any increase in acceptability which is a function of the amount of white blood in the socially defined Negro group. This premise is quite congruent with the short-term trends observed for California, Hawaii, and Mich-

igan in the data available for the period since 1950. We have chosen to take the trend in the Michigan data as a model in the elaboration of this premise. In a ten-year time period, from 1953 to 1963, the value of R(g) for Michigan increased from .008 to .017. For this period the regression of R(g) with time in years was computed. The value of the regression coefficient was .0007, indicating an average rise of R(g) by this amount each year. We have assumed that for a full generation (approximately 27 years in duration) the increase in R(g) for the United States would be approximately 27 times the average annual increase for the ten-year period in Michigan, or .019 each generation. We have therefore supposed in each of these three most liberal assumptions, that in each successive generation R(g) would increase by .019. In one of the three assumptions which supposes this type of increase in R(g) we have presumed no increase in R(g) due to dilution of Negro blood in the socially defined Negro stock. In the two remaining assumptions we suppose additional increases due to dilution of Negro blood. These presumed additional increases are identical respectively to the increases we have previously assumed in our second and third assumptions for Y(g).
In summary, our six assumptions for Y(g) yield the following equations for the proportion white in successive generations.
= W(g) {l
W(g+l)=W(g)

x[\-W(g)] = W(g)

W(g+l)=W(g)x{l-[(.019xg) + R(O)]x[l-W(g)} (g) x (.019xg)
The six equations are then expanded to twelve upon assuming the value of R(O) to be either .008 or .017.1
RESULTS
The deductions from projecting our twelve sets of assumptions are shown in Table 2. Under the spanner for each assumption concerning Y(g) we show in the column marked a the results when R(O) is assumed to be .008 and in the column marked b the results when R(O) is assumed to be .017. The deductions from the most conservative of the six assumptions concerning Y(g) are presented in the two columns farthest to the left as Projections la and lb; the deductions from the most liberal of the assumptions concerning Y(g) are presented in the two columns furthest to the right as Projections 6a and 6b. Two features of these projections are especially striking. The first of these is that all of the projections show no substantial change in the racial composition of the nation during the next 100 years or so. After four generations, the nation would be 88.7% white if we base our prediction
1 In all twelve of our equations we have also assumed that R(g) never rises beyond a value of one.

on the most conservative projection, and 85.7% white if we base it on our most liberal projection. Thus, unless our most liberal projection is unnecessarily conservative, we can safely say that racial intermarriage will have little effect on the composition of the United States population by race within the next 100 years. The same positive statement cannot be made concerning the situation approximately 200 years hence. After eight generations, the proportion of the total population belonging to the white race would be only 49.7% according to our most liberal projection as compared with 88.4% according to our most conservative projection. The disparity between the projections reaches its greatest magnitude twelve generations hence. According to our most liberal projections, in 12 generations amalgamation of the two races will have been accomplished; according to our most conservative projections, after 12 generations the racial composition of the nation will be practically identical to what it is at present.
The second striking feature of the projections is the tremendous range between them in the time shown as necessary to attain complete amalgamation of the races. According to Projection 6b, the time necessary for complete amalgamation 2 is only 12 generations or approximately 324 years; according to Projection 6a it is 13 generations. According to Projection 5b, 14 generations would be necessary; according to Projection 5a, 15 generations; according to Projection 4b, 30 generations; according to Projection 4a, 31 generations; according to Projection 3b, 42 generations; according to Projection 3a, 90 generations; according to Projection 2b, 124 generations; according to Projection 2a, 265 genera-
2 Complete amalgamation is operationally defined as attained when the proportion of all brides and grooms who are white descends below 0.01%.

tions; and according to Projection lb, 662 generations. Finally, according to Projection la, complete amalgamation would not yet be quite attained even after 1,000 generations; after that very lengthy 27,000 year period the proportion of all brides and grooms of pure white race would still be 0.26%.
Because of this exceedingly wide discrepancy between the twelve projections in the time shown as necessary to attain racial amalgamation, it would be foolhardy to predict when amalgamation of white and Negro races in the United States might occur. The only prediction one might make on the basis of the results of these projections is that amalgamation in the United States will probably not occur during the lifetime of anyone now present. If racial amalgamation is indeed necessary to achieve full equality for the Negro, one might conclude that this equality will not be soon forthcoming. One might also conclude that an early resolution of the current tension between the races will probably not be possible.
