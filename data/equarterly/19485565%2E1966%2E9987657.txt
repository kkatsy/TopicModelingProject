CHILD-BEARING PATTERN OF AMERICAN WOMEN*

Fertility rate of an industrialized society is determined by a variety of factors. Besides the composition of population by age, sex, and marital status, other variables also influence fertility by creating conditions conducive to low fertility. Further, even under controlled fertility conditions, attitudes regarding family size and the time taken for its completion, have wide ranges of variation not only among individuals but also over one's own life cycle.
All these components of variation are characteristics of recent fertility history of the United States that have sustained the current fertility rate at its present level of around 25 per 1,000 population. But insofar as reproductive behavior is concerned, the population may be subdivided into relatively homogeneous groups as they differ among themselves with respect to demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and concomitant differences in intensities of motivation and ability to control the number of offspring. Consequently, the contribution of different segments of the population show significant variations around the national average.
This paper is the first of a series of studies of differential fertility based on 1960 census figures of the United States. A few aspects like the extent of childlessness and the number of children born by age and marriage duration groups of women have been studied in this report. Fertility differentials by occupation, education, income, and socioeconomic status

BAND PRESENT AND NUMBER OF CHILDREN
BORN
Data for 1960 have been obtained from one in one thousand sample as furnished by the Bureau of the Census in magnetic tapes. This study has been further restricted by including only those women who are married once and living with their husbands at the time of the census. The simplicity gained by this control does not seem to be outweighed by the limitations, since such women constitute 86% of those who are presently married. In Table I the percentages have been shown by age groups.
The relatively smaller percentage in the first age group is somewhat surprising. Of all women currently married, about 3.5% belong to this age group, which, in absolute number, is quite large. Dissolution of first marriages resulting

from death of husband appears to be an unlikely explanation. The above evidence probably indicates relative instability of early marriages.
The percentage is highest in the next age range, 20 to 24, and declines thereafter. White/nonwhite differentials are in the expected direction, which increase in magnitude with age.
Of the women married once and husband present, a large number has not yet given birth to children. Table 2 shows the distribution.
Ages 25 and onward are marked by greater childlessness among nonwhites than among whites, the differences ranging from 3 to 10 percentage points. This is difficult to interpret, although reversal in earlier age groups can be explained in terms of the well-known fact of greater motivation and success on the part of whites to plan their families. For both races, however, childlessness declines after age 15 and reaches its minimum in the age group 30 to 34, when it increases again. Increased childlessness after age 35 is somewhat surprising in view of the fact that more than 97% of these women were married for at least five years. Since these are all women married only once with husband present, an immediate explanation may be that first births postponed temporarily are more likely to be

postponed for an indefinite period. This proposition however, cannot be verified with the available data.
It may be observed that in any age group, the number of childless women can be subdivided into four groups. First, some couples are biologically incapable of having children. Second, some may have planned to remain childless. Third, those who married recently or became pregnant for the first time at the time of the census were also reported as childless. Fourth, some women, particularly those who are young, may have postponed their pregnancies to a later date. It is not known how these components affect the proportion of childless women in a given age group at a particular instant of time. However, the contribution of the fourth component should be relatively small in upper age brackets. Also, the proportion of women in the first category should be independent of age, although there may be genuine racial differences in fecundity. In any case, if the distributions are controlled by marriage duration in addition to age, then the minimum proportion of childlessness in any age and marriage duration category can be regarded as an upper limit of the proportion of sterile couples provided those who deliberately planned to remain childless are relatively few in number. This has been shown in Table 3.
For whites, the minimum of 3.9% occurs in age group 35 to 39 with marriage duration of 20 years or more. Nonwhites exhibit a minimum of 3.3% in age group 20 to 24 with marriage duration of 5 to 10 years. It can therefore be said that no more that 3.9% of white and 3.3% of nonwhite couples are biologically incapable of having children.
Of white women aged 45 to 49, married once with husband present, 22.1% were reported childless, although they

were married for 15 to 20 years. It is extremely unlikely that these women became mothers during the postcensus period. If sterility can explain no more than 3.9% of the cases, then the remaining 18.2% women must be those who decided to remain childless. For the same age group, the above percentage declines to 6.5 for marriage duration of 20 or more years. Neither the very high percentage of 18.2, nor the sharp decline to 6.5 can be explained with available data.
As may be expected, highest rates of childlessness are found in each age-race category where marriage duration is two years or less. The proportions also decline with increase in marriage duration. Fewer childlessness among nonwhites than among whites is found for marriage duration of five years or less. However, the reversal of this pattern for marriage duration of five or more years is difficult to explain. It may be recalled that a similar result was also found when marriage duration was left uncontrolled.
In general, childlessness increases with age for every marriage duration group. This is so because in any marriage duration group, higher present age is equivalent to higher age at marriage, which, biologically at least, acts as a deterrent to childbirth. But it is possible that the conditions that prevented a marriage to

take place early in life were precisely those that also prevented a conception to occur in matrimony.
Distribution of mothers by number of children born is shown in Table 4 where the last figure in each column refers to an open-ended interval.
Dissimilarities between the two distributions are worth noting. Nonwhite wives have shown higher rates of childlessness than white wives at ages 25 and above, but the deficit in total number of births created thereby is more than made up by nonwhite mothers. Thus a difference of more than 10 percentage points may be observed at ages 30 and above when comparisons are made between proportions of women who have given birth to largest number of children (7 or more). In fact, the nonwhite percentages are uniformly higher for 4 or more children. For whites, modal number of children born is 2, next highest being 3; but for nonwhites, no such preference is indicated. Thus, 75 to 85% of the whites aged 25 to 49 had 3 children or less as against 35 to 47% of the nonwhites who had 4 children or more.

women are all currently married and married only once with husband present, marriage duration can be obtained by substracting the age at marriage from age at present. Table 5 shows the distribution for white women only.
As may be expected, total number of children born increases with marriage duration. Also, if marriage duration is held constant, number of children born

is found to decline with increase in mother's age. Apparently, this demonstrates an inverse relationship between delayed marriage and fertility. But age at marriage may also be associated with socioeconomic status characteristics that probably are more direct determinants of the number of offspring.

horts. If the fertility pattern of the different cohorts remained relatively constant, then the diagonals corresponding to marriage duration groups 5 to 10, 10 to 15 and 15 to 20 could hypothetically be regarded as both birth and marriage cohorts. In that case, figures in the diagonals should increase consistently with marriage durations (the last interval being open-ended is left out). This is so because after a period of five years, all women move to the next age group; and the women who were not widowed, divorced, etc. during the decade, also move to the next marriage duration interval. For such groups of women, cumulative number of children born, under constant fertility condition, should never decline, but rather increase at reasonable rates. The observed trend does not conform to this pattern because of the wellknown fact of fertility increase and changes in spacing of births in recent years.
The last column is also interesting. A few years of fertile life is still left to mothers who are less than 40, but they have already borne more children than their predecessor birth cohorts. In fact, average number of children born to mothers aged 35 to 39 married for 20 or more years is 3.3 as against 2.9 for similar women in the age group 40 to 44.

Observing the reproductive patterns of the previous birth and marriage cohorts, it seems almost certain that completed cohort fertility will not decline, but may continue to increase over the next 10 or 15 years.
Nonwhites exhibit the pattern shown in Table 6.
The pattern is not dissimilar to whites except that nonwhite women have larger numbers of children in almost each age and marriage duration interval. The largest number of children born (4.5 per mother) corresponds to age group 25 to 29 and marriage duration of 10 to 15 years. Surprising as this may be, it has been also noted that the corresponding whites are the second highest fertile group (3.1 per mother), the largest (3.3) being the mothers aged 35 to 39 married for 20 years or more. It seems clear that a reduction in current fertility rates would not bring a reversal of the present trend of continuously increasing completed cohort fertility rates within next 10 or 15 years.
It will be interesting to compare the number of children born by woman's age and marriage duration as observed in 1960 against those in 1950. In 1950 whites had the pattern shown in Table 7.
Comparison between similar age groups in the two censuses reveals that for

each marriage duration category the number of children born has appreciably increased over the decade, with the exception of the highest marriage duration group where the figures are virtually alike. On an average, women in the broad agerange 25to 44 who are married for, say, 10 to 15 years, have given birth to 0.5 more children than the women in similar age and marriage duration group 10 years ago. To a large extent, then, the increase in number of children born measures a real shift to a larger family size.
While these are comparisons of fertility levels of women in similar ageand marriage duration group at two time periods, the same generation of women can also be followed to determine their reproductive behavior over the decade. Thus, a large proportion of women aged, say, 20 to 24 in the marriage duration category 5 to 10 years in 1950, moved to the age group 30 to 34 and marriage duration of 15 to 20 years in 1960. Some of them have either died or lost their marital status during the decade, but their exclusion from the 1950 group of women should not affect the cohort fertility rate in 1950. Accordingly, the difference between the total number of children born to these groups of women in 1950 and 1960 should measure the

increase in family size with a 10-year increase in marriage duration.
For the group mentioned above (i.e., women aged 20 to 24 in 1950 andmarried for a period of 5 to 10 years),number of children born per 1,000 women increased from 2,012 in 1950 to 2,915 in 1960 as both their age and marriage duration increased by 10 years. Corresponding shifts in the number of children born per 1,000 women aged 25 to 29 and 30 to 34 in the same marriage duration category in 1950 were from 1,880 to 2,979 and from 1,669 to 2,557, respectively. For each of these three age groups, the increase is of the order of one child per woman, as she moves from marriage duration category of 5 to 10 years to that of 15 to 20 years. For the next age group (35 to 39), this increase, although small in comparison to younger women, is still of the order of one-half of one child. All these data indicate that American women are giving birth to children quite late in their fertile period.
It is now possible to derive estimates of cohort fertility rates in 1970, on the basis of the results of the two previous censuses. Since such projection will depend upon the assumption made about the course of future fertility trend, it has been considered advisable to examine

Vol. 13, No. 2

only a segment of the distribution by age and marriage duration. Accordingly, for a few specific age and marriage duration groups, the trend shown in Table 8 may be observed if the increments in total number of births as described in the previous paragraph can be assumed to continue during 1960-70.
Figures for 1970 have been obtained by adding to the total number of children already born to a given cohort of women until 1960, the number expected to be born during the present decade. The latter has been made equivalent to the difference in total number of children born over 1950-60 to women who were in the same age group in 1950. It may be noted that if the constancy of relative rather than absolute increments is assumed, estimates for 1970 will be even higher, since cohort fertility rates in 1960 are higher than those in 1950. Admittedly, projections like these are nothing but elementary arithmetical exercises; therefore, the results can not be extended beyond the assumptions on which they are based. But one thing is quite clear from the above projection. If the 1970 cohort fertility rates are to remain steady at 1960 levels, most of the women over 30 will have to curtail their fertility during 1960-70 by at least 50% of the rate found during 1950-60. Evidences as yet do not seem to be in

favor of such a dramatic decline; accordingly, the 1970 cohort fertility rates will, in all likelihood, far exceed the 1960 rates.
The relation between current and cohort fertility rates is not simple. An immediate reduction of current fertility rate to 50% of its present level will have minor effect on cohort fertility rate in the short run. The latter, however, will decline if birth rate at a lower level can be sustained over a longer period of time. Further, cohort fertility of married women is determined only by the total number of children born to them and not by their dates of birth. The latter, however, is more directly related to current birth and population growth rate.
The child-bearing pattern of women is best understood when fertility data are analyzed by marriage duration periods. It is abundantly clear from 1960 figures that women married before they are too old hardly need more than 10 years of married life to replace themselves. Consequently, children born afterwards contribute towards population increase.
DISCUSSION
At present, mortality rate in the United States is around 9 deaths per 1,000 population per year. This is much lower than the current birth rate, which is about 25 per 1,000 per year. In terms of generation fertility, therefore, a decline in growth rate can take place (assuming no increase in death rate) only if women, most of whom marry during their life time, give birth to fewer children in future.
It will be interesting to examine the reduction in average numbers of children born per woman, if those who have borne four or more children have given birth to only three or only four. These

modified averages together with the actual average are shown in Table 9 for ages 30 and above.
It was observed before that in percentage terms, nonwhites exceed their white counterparts both at childlessness as well as at the other end of the continuum and that the actual averages are much higher for the nonwhites. Because of this extreme nature of the distribution of nonwhites by number of children born, the modified averages are drastically reduced (by about one child per woman), even when the maximum is limited to a number as high as four. Corresponding reductions in averages for whites are, however, small, as relatively few white women are found to have given birth to more than four children. It is also interesting to observe that white/nonwhite differentials are virtually eliminated at either of the two maximum limits.
A comparison between the modified averages (with a maximum of four) and the average number of children born by age and marriage duration categories will show that for white women these

averages match very well when the marriage duration is no larger than 10 years. For the nonwhites, this happens even earlier. As a result, a large number of these women are still left with quite a few years of fertile life even after they have been replaced by their next generation of children.
It may be repeated that the above calculations are based on women married once with husband present and that the population growth is also affected by the reproductive behavior of other women. Although the inclusion of all women may have the effect of depressing the averages, it seems unlikely that the generation net reproduction rate of younger cohorts of women will be less than unity if no more than four children are born to a mother.
