RESIDENTIAL AREAS AND DIFFERENTIAL FERTILITY

One of the forms of differential fertility that first came to the demographer's attention was the variation in birth rates between parts of an urban area. Several of the classic studies of differential fertility were based on contrasts between "rich" and "poor" districts within a city.1 Some well-known studies in the American literature later exploited the same approach, with considerable refinements in methodology (Thompson, 1939; Kitagawa, 1953) and the appearance of occasional publications in which it is still used (Kiser, 1961) suggests that the topic of fertility variations by residential areas continues to be of interest. In consequence of the discussion of "ecological correlation" in the sociological literature (Robinson, 1950; Duncan, et al., 1961), however, some uncertainty has arisen as to whether areal variations are to be accepted at face value as evidence of socioeconomic differentials. To clarify the question, this paper examines differences by residential area simultaneously with variation according to measures of the socioeconomic characteristics of the individual married couple.
The data are taken from the Household Survey of Indianapolis conducted in the summer of 1941 by the Committee on the Study of Social and Psychological Factors Affecting Fertility (Whelpton and Kiser, 1946). The survey data are limited to native-white married couples,

neither spouse married more than once, with the wife under 45 years of age. Virtually 100 per cent coverage of such couples residing in Indianapolis was achieved by the survey. The present analysis is further limited to couples in which the wife was 40 to 44 years old and in which both spouses were Protestants. In the original reports on the survey (Whelpton and Kiser, 1946, ch. ii), there were 5,283 such "both Protestant" couples. When the punch cards were retabulated for this study--some two decades after the original work--it was possible to locate only 5,268 couples. By comparison with the published figures, however, it is possible to determine that the missing 15 couples are scattered over most of the categories of the socioeconomic classifications, and their omission cannot possibly result in any significant distortion of the findings.
With minor variations, except for the use of a residential area classification, the variables examined here are the same as those studied in the original reports. In tabulating the education classifications, respondents stating only broad educational class (elementary, high school, or college) were grouped with respondents reporting themselves as nongraduates of those levels; e.g., grade school, year not specified, was combined with elementary, less than 8 years. In tabulating region of birth, individuals of unknown region were assumed to be born in the North. In tabulating tenure, cases with tenure unknown were combined with renters.

of the information in the Indianapolis Study reports, each household in the survey was identified by the number of the census tract in Indianapolis where it was residing in 1941. The residential area code for this analysis classifies each couple by the median contract or estimated monthly rent of the dwelling units in the census tract in 1940 (U. S. Bur. Census, 1942). Contract rent was ascertained in the 1940 Census for tenant-occupied units; for owner-occupied units, an estimate of monthly rental value was supplied to the census enumerator by the occupant. Inasmuch as the Household Survey data similarly include the rent actually paid by tenants and the estimated rental value of owner-occupied units, it is possible to classify each couple simultaneously by the rent level in the neighborhood wherein it resided and

the rental value of the particular dwelling unit in which it was living.
The two rent classifications must be positively correlated, of course, but intratract variation in rent requires that the correlation be far from perfect. There are appreciable numbers of couples in predominantly low-rent areas paying relatively high rents, and vice versa, as is shown by the top panel of Table 1.
Both classifications reveal the generally inverse relationship of completed fertility to socioeconomic status that prevailed in the general population at the time of the Indianapolis Study. See Figure 1, which is patterned after the method of graphic presentation employed in the study of Kitagawa (Kitagawa, 1953, Fig. 3). Dwelling-unit rent apparently is the more discriminating

classification, as is confirmed by the fact that it accounts for 15.7 per cent of the total sum of squares of children ever born, while tract rent accounts for 11.6 per cent. Yet, as Figure 1 makes clear, the investigator would not have been misled as to the pattern of differential fertility by rent if he had relied on the areal classification to establish this pattern. To be sure, from the tract classification he could not compute directly the slope of the curve of fertility on dollars of dwelling-unit rent, and to this extent the critique of "ecological correlation" is well taken.
The question remains as to whether the two patterns, since they are so similar are merely redundant. A negative answer is suggested by the lower panel of Table 1, where mean fertility is shown

for each cell in the cross-classification of couples by tract rent and dwelling-unit rent. In interpreting this table, allowance must be made for small frequencies in some cells. Where the frequencies are substantial, however, one generally finds a pattern of decreasing means, reading both left to right and top to bottom. Each classification, therefore, is related to fertility, to some extent, apart from its overlap with the other.
This conclusion can be stated in a more convenient form, by resorting to the procedure of multiple classification analysis. This method has been little used in demographic work2 but is applicable in any situation where indirect

standardization or the method of expected cases might be used. It provides a more elegant and more readily justified reduction of the data, in many instances, than do these techniques. It is computationally feasible now that highspeed computers make possible the rapid solution of large numbers of simultaneous linear equations.3 The model is as follows:

Yhy is the number of children ever born to the hih couple in the tth category of classification A and the ;th category of classification B; Y is the grand mean fertility for all couples; A, is an increment, or "effect," positive or negative, added to the grand mean for all couples in the «h category of A; and Bj is an increment for membership in the ;th category of B. There are a distinct effects for that many categories of A, and b effects for the categories of B, of which a--I and 6-- 1, respectively, are independent. The constants, Aj and Bj, are computed on the condition of least squares; i.e., so as to minimize the sum of the squared residuals, T ' U2hlj. This

maining ones of the effects, Aj and Bj. To take the place of the omitted equations, we impose the conditions,
This requires the effects to appear as deviations from the grand mean.
The solution of the normal equations for this model, using the data in Table 1, appears in Table 2, in the column for "combination (1)." Comparison of the "net effects" in this column with the "deviations" in the column immediately to the left suggests how controlling for one of the classifications influences our estimate of the extent to which fertility varies according to the other. Thus, the observed deviations of means for categories of tract rent vary from 1.71 (for tracts where rent is lowest) to -- .72 (for the highest rent tracts). When dwellingunit rent is controlled, or partialed out, this variation is from .81 to --.33. This would appear to be still a substantial amount of variation, however, and the pattern of differentials remains intact. To discuss the point in terms of "explained" variation, we may recall that dwelling-unit rent alone accounts for 15.7 per cent of the total sum of squares. When tract rent is considered along with dwelling-unit rent in the multiple-classification model, the proportion of variation accounted for rises to 17.0 per cent. If one chooses to regard these data as a random sample from some universe and to neglect their departure from certain of the assumptions of the analysis of variance, the appropriate F-test (Brownlee, 1960) indicates that this increment is highly significant: P<.001 for an increment due to the second classification, with 5 degrees of freedom, being this large if the true values of Ai=0 for all i.
It will be noted that the model assumes additivity of effects: the incre-

ment for A[ is the same regardless of which of the b categories of B is considered, and the increment for Bj does not depend on which category of A is involved. Because of its convenience and simplicity this assumption may be accepted by the analyst even if it results in some distortion of the facts. (The same kind of assumption and distortions due to it are at stake in conventional multiple regression analysis, for example). There may, nevertheless, be interest in testing the assumption. The current preoccupation of some sociologists with effects of "status inconsistency" seems to rest on the hypothesis, usually not explicitly formulated, that an additive model is not adequate to account for the pattern of the data.
If the question is approached from the standpoint of statistical inference, one may carry out an F-test for the significance of interaction (Brownlee, 1960, p. 520) in Table 1. The 47 cell means in Table 1 account for 17.7 per cent of the total sum of squares, as compared with 17.0 per cent for the additive combination of the two classifications. Since this increment is gained through the use of 34 additional degrees of freedom, it is not significant. (Recall the qualification on the applicability of the analysis of variance with these data.)
We can look at the problem of status consistency effects in another way. In Table 1, ignoring the last line for "unknown" dwelling-unit rent, the asterisked cells identify couples whose dwelling-unit rent is reasonably consistent with the prevailing rent levels of their residential neighborhoods. In cells above and to the right are couples paying lower rents than are common in their neighborhoods; and in cells below and to the left of the asterisked cells are couples paying higher rents than the average in

their residential areas. It would be easy to develop a social-psychological rationale for anticipating deviant fertility behavior on the part of couples in either of these latter two "status inconsistent" categories. Indeed, if we aggregate the couples in the three consistency categories, we find that the mean number of children ever born is 1.944 for statusconsistent couples, 3.005 for couples paying rents which are low by neighborhood standards, and 2.298 for couples paying high rents in comparison with their neighbors. On the face of the matter, either type of inconsistency increases fertility.
If, now, we return to our additive model, we may evaluate this finding. For each combination of a dwelling-unit rent and a tract rent category we may obtain the calculated mean fertility implied by the model, making use of the formula, Y'^zrY+Aj+Bj. Making this calculation for each cell of the table and multiplying the calculated mean by the number of couples in the cell (nyY'y) supplies the figures needed to aggregate couples into the three status-consistency categories. It is then found that the model implies means of 1.937 for statusconsistent couples and 2.992 and 2.314 for the two inconsistent types in the order they were given above. These fall short of the observed means by .007, .013, and --.016, respectively. It requires no test of significance to see that there is no effect of status consistency or inconsistency as such, apart from the effects attributable to the combination of statuses comprising the consistency type.
To summarize, the analysis thus far suggests that the areal classification of rent levels produces fertility variations which are partially independent of and additive to those due to the classification of individual dwelling units by rent. The

final problem to be investigated with these data concerns the possibility that the net effect of tract rent is attributable to some other variable or combination of variables that happens to be associated with the areal classification but which is itself more directly responsible for variation in fertility than is the character of the neighborhood as such. We are limited to the particular variables covered in the survey, but these include several already known to produce variation in fertility. The second multiple classification analysis summarized in Table 2 indicates that educational attainment of both husband and wife may be relevant, as their respective effects are not wholly overlapping. Age of wife at marriage is an obvious possibility for interpreting differential fertility by almost any other socioeconomic variable. Region of birth and tenure, though they do not produce major differentials, might be expected to show a pattern of areal clustering that could be helpful in interpreting variation by a classification of areas.
The approach, again, is that of multiple classification, making use of the type of model already described, which can be extended in a straightforward manner to encompass a considerable number of classificatory factors. Combination (3) in Table 2 includes in the model all the classifications mentioned, except tract rent, while combination (4) includes tract rent as well.
Inspecting the net effects for tract rent in this last combination, we see that control of additional variables has attenuated but not eliminated the effects attributable to the areal classification. In comparing combinations (3) and (4), we are interested in the question of whether adding tract rent to the battery of other variables results in accounting for addi-

tional variation. The answer is affirmative, although the magnitude of the increment is not great. The six classifications in combination (3) account for 26.3 per cent of the total sum of squares, the seven classifications in combination (4) for 26.8 per cent. On the same kind of significance test cited previously, this is a significant increment.
To summarize this second part of the investigation, variation in fertility by socioeconomic level of residential area may be partly due to such associated factors as education, age at marriage, regional origin, and tenure, as well as the rental paid for the couple's own dwelling unit. Not all of the variation related to areal classification can be so explained, however, since this factor has significant net effects when all the others are controlled.
This exploration, therefore, serves to bolster our confidence in the general validity of the findings of studies in differential fertility where areal variation was the sole source of information on socioeconomic differentials. At the same time, analyses in which an areal classification is examined simultaneously with several individual classifications of socioeconomic characteristics suggest that areal differentials in fertility may not be completely reducible to the areally clustered effects of some conventional individual variables.
