RELATIONS AMONG INTER-RELIGIOUS MARRIAGES, MINIGIORWATAO1 RY MARRIAGES AND CIVIL WEDDINGS
LOREN E. CHANCELLOR2 LEE G. BURCHINAL3

1 HIS REPORT is based on data for two types of inter-religious marriage patterns in Iowa from 1953 through 1957. The focus of the study is on the relations between inter-religious marriages, migratory marriages, and civil wedding ceremonies. In addition, some relationships between ages of brides and status levels of grooms with migratory marriages and civil weddings are tested.
HYPOTHESES
Inter-religious marriages represent deviations from the religious endogamy mate selection norm in American society (Glick, 1960). Previous analyses of the Iowa data indicated that religious endogamy is inversely related to theages at marriage of spouses and to the status level of thegrooms (Eurchinal andChancellor, 1962). These relationships were

interpreted asreflecting differences inthe reinforcement of the religious endogamy norm in the reference groups of persons from different status levels or thosewho married at different ages.
Two other characteristics, migratory marriages and civil wedding ceremonies, represent additional deviations from current marriage norms in the United States. Persons who are involved inmigratory marriages or in civil wedding ceremonies probably have different orientations toward marriage than those who abide by the norms for these two marriage characteristics. If they exist, the differences in marriage orientations between these two groups of persons area function of the differences the two groups of persons have had in their socialization and other premarital reference group experiences. The reference group experiences of persons involved in migratory or civil marriages should provide less support for the religious endogamy norm as well as less support for the importance of marriage in the bride's home town, home state, andfor a churchsanctioned marriage. Thedata available for use in the present investigation do

not permit determination of the direction of causality between the variables under study. We cannot say whether reference group experiences associated with marriage orientations which result in migratory marriages or civil wedding ceremonies contribute to the likelihood of inter-religious marriages; or, whether, given the circumstances which have led to inter-religious marriages, more of these couples than the religiously endogamous couples prefer, or feel forced, to marry in another state or to be married by a civil official. The present data permit only a test of the association of religious endogamy and migratory marriages and civil ceremonies.
On these bases, two hypotheses follow: 1) religious endogamy is lower among couples involved in migratory marriages than among couples who marry in the bride's state of residence; and 2) religious endogamy is lower among couples whose marriages are performed by civil officials than among those couples whose marriages are performed by clergymen.
Three additional hypotheses may be at least partially tested with the present data: 3) migratory marriages are greater among marriages involving younger brides than those involving older brides; 4) civil ceremonies are greater among the marriages of younger than older brides; and 5) civil marriages are inversely related to the status levels of the grooms. The test between age at marriage and migratory marriages is limited because comparisons can be made only between marriages involving resident Iowa brides and marriages involving brides from other states who were married in Iowa. Data for marriage of Iowa brides who were married in states other than Iowa are not available.
The three additional hypotheses are based on the view that reference group

influences associated with young age at marriage or with low status level provide less support for various sexual relationships and marriage norms (Kinsey, 1948, 1953) in the United States, including those under observation in the present study. Unfortunately, tabulations for the relationship between migratory marriage and status were not built into the original plan of analyses.
METHODOLOGY
The religious affiliations and ages of both spouses and the occupations of the grooms were collated for all first marriages between whites in Iowa during 1953-1957. The roughly two per cent ol

the cases lacking these data, as well as an insignificant number of marriages which

I

involved non-Christians, were omitted

from the study.

The spousal religious affiliation types

used in the present investigation are shown in Table 1. Roman Catholic affiliation was use3 as one category. The re-

a

maining spouses were originally classified as those who indicated a specific denominational affiliation (hereafter called

church-Protestants), those who referred to themselves merely as Protestants, but gave no denominational affiliation; and

those who indicated no religious affilia-

tion. Original tests of thehypothesis for the relationships between age levels and

inter-religious marriage rates were based

on the 16 spousal religious affiliation types obtained from the four religious

affiliation categories for each spouse. The

analyses between patterns of inter-religious marriage rates and the agesof

church-Protestant or Catholic spouses Pe with Protestant spouses or those who reported no religious affiliation were rela-

tively similar. Because of this similarity,

and for simplicity in reporting the data, the Protestant and the no affiliation cate-

gories were combined as the "other"

category as shown in the tables. In Tables 1 and 2, inter-religious marriages

represented by both types of unionsin

which the spouses did not report the same religious affiliations, and the com-

bined inter-religious marriage rates, are

reported. For ease of table construction, only the combined inter-religious mar-

riage rates are listed in Table 3. The

combined inter-religious marriage rates are used for testing thehypotheses. The

data for the two specific inter-religious

marriage types are provided for readers who maywant them.

the hypotheses than similar analyses for the church-Protestant populations. As can be seen from the tables, about 26% of the brides included in the first marriages under study were Catholics. Catholic grooms constituted approximately 27% of the grooms involved in the marriage population. It is estimated that about 16% of the Iowa population is Catholic. Since Catholics represent a minority group in most Iowa communities, the opportunities for a Catholic young person to meet, become acquainted with, and conduct courtship with another young Catholic person who meets various personal criteria are less than the corresponding opportunities for most church-Protestant youth. Because of their minority position in Iowa, inter-religious marriage rates among Catholics should be greater than corresponding rates for church-Protestants (Thomas, 1951; Locke, Sabagh and Thomes, 1957; Glick, 1960; Heer, 1960). Therefore, if the variables under study have some range and are related to inter-religious marriage patterns, the relationships could be observed more clearly in the Catholic populations.
The status levels of the grooms were based on the occupational code used by the Iowa Division of Vital Statistics. The high status level included professional men, farm operators, proprietors, managers, and officials; the middle status level included clerks, sales personnel, and men engaged in the crafts; and the low status level included operatives, domestic servants, laborers, and farm laborers. Men in the armed forces were retained as a separate category because this group undoubtedly contained considerable and unknown degrees of status variation.
RESULTS
Data are combined for the five-year period, since yearly percentages for inter-

religious marriage rates showed very little variation. None of the three tables provides the actual inter-religious marriage rates based on the religious affiliations of the brides or grooms. Interreligious marriages rates were greater among Iowa Catholics than among Iowa church-Protestants; approximately 13% of the church-Protestant brides, 24% oi the Catholic brides, 9% of the churchProtestant grooms, and 21% of the Catholic grooms entered inter-religious marriages from 1953 through 1957.
STATE OF RESIDENCE AND INTER-
RELIGIOUS MARRIAGE RATES
The hypothesis for the relationship between inter-religious marriage rates and migratory marriages was first tested by comparing the proportions of each spousal religious affiliation type for which brides were Iowa residents. Analyses were limited to the residence of the bride because of the customary practice of having the wedding in the home town of the bride. All tests supported the hypothesis for the first marriages of church-Protestant or Catholic brides or grooms. Larger percentages of the religiously endogamous and smaller percentages of the inter-religious marriages included brides who were Iowa residents. As shown in Table 1, the differences were larger among Catholic brides or grooms than among church-Protestant brides or grooms.
The data provided in Table 2 permitted retesting the association of interreligious marriage patterns with migratory marriage rates within controlled levels for the ages of the brides. In each of the seven age levels among churchProtestant brides, smaller percentages of the brides who married inter-religiously were residents of Iowa. Larger percentages of the brides who married endogamously were Iowa residents. The same

80 Chancellor, Burchinal

pattern was observed among all but the youngest Catholic brides. At each age level, the percentage differences of Iowa brides in the endogamous and interreligious marriages were greater among Catholic brides than church-Protestant brides. The analyses based on the control for the brides' ages provided additional strong support for the first hypothesis.
The hypothesis for the relationship between young age at marriage and migratory marriage was also tested by data given in Table 2. Data provided for all of the totals--totals for church-Protestant or Catholic brides, for both categories of brides, and for all marriages, some of which were not included in other analyses, were used to test this hypothesis. In all comparisons, the lowest percentages for resident Iowa brides occurred at age 16 and the highest at age 21 or 22. Smaller proportions of the teen-aged brides than of 21- or 22-year-old brides were residents of Iowa. Within the limits noted earlier, the data in Table 2 also supported the hypothesis for the relationship between age at marriage and migratory marriage. The most notable effects, however, were restricted to the youngest age level. The analysis was not carried beyond age 22, since the intent of the analysis was to test migratory marriage rate differences between the teen-aged brides and the brides with the lowest inter-religious rates--those who were 21 and 22 years of age.
TYPE OF MARRIAGE CEREMONY AND
INTER-RELIGIOUS MARRIAGE RATES
The second hypothesis was that religious endogamy is lower among couples who have civil as compared with church weddings. The data used in testing this hypothesis are shown in Table 3. In these analyses, the ages of the brides and status levels of grooms were controlled

because it was expected that the type of wedding ceremony would vary with these variables independently of the spousal religious affiliation combinations.
The percentages of civil ceremonies for the total first marriage comparisons, based on all age and status levels and shown as the last two sets of rows on the left of Table 3, provided the most general test of the hypothesis. For both church-Protestant and Catholic brides, civil ceremonies occurred about four times more frequently among all interreligious marriages than among all religiously endogamous marriages. This ratio was also observed in each of the three status levels for all church-Protestant or Catholic brides. When status was ignored and age was used as the control variable, as shown in the five sets of totals for each age and spousal religious affiliation combination on the left of the table, all comparisons agreed with the expected direction of difference. Furthermore, the expected direction of difference in the proportions of civil wedding ceremonies between the inter-religious marriages and the religiously endogamous marriages was observed in all 30 joint age and status comparisons for church-Protestant brides and Catholic brides.
The data uniformly supported the hypothesis for the relationship between inter-religious marriage rates and civil wedding rates.
The data in Table 3 can also be used to test the hypothesis for the relationships between younger age at marriage the religiously endogamous marriages rates. The hypothesis for the relationship between the ages of the brides and the percentages of civil wedding ceremonies was strongly supported. The percentages of civil weddings were highest among the youngest brides, regardless of the spousal religious affiliations, and declined consistently to the lowest rates for

Relations Among Inter-religious Marriages, etc.

brides who were 23 through 29 years old. Civil wedding rates increased slightly among the oldest brides. The decline in civil wedding rates from age 17 or under to 23 through 29, and then a slight increase, was observed for both the total populations and all three status populations of church-Protestant and Catholic brides.
In all comparisons among civil ceremony percentages for church-Protestant or Catholic brides in the five age levels and for the four total sample analyses, inverse relationships were observed between status levels and percentages of civil wedding ceremonies. Thus, these data uniformly supported the inverse relationship between status levels of grooms and civil wedding rates.
The age and status variables interacted to produce the least incidence of civil wedding ceremonies among couples which included brides between 23 and 29 who were married to high status grooms. The highest civil wedding rates were observed among couples involving brides who were 17 or 18 years old and married to low status grooms.
It was surprising to observe that civil wedding rates for endogamous Catholic marriages were at least minutely greater than those for endogamous church-Protestant marriages in 14 of the 15 comparisons between matched age cells in the three status levels. Ten of the percentage differences were less than three per cent. The five larger differences occurred in the two youngest age-level, low-status cells. Regardless of the ages of the brides, civil ceremony rate differences between endogamous Catholic marriages and endogamous church-Protestant marriages were negligible in the high status levels. Also, regardless of status, the differences were negligible in the 19 to 29 age range.
In all 15 comparisons between church-

Protestant inter-religious marriages and Catholic inter-religious marriages in which the ages of the brides and status levels of the grooms were controlled, civil wedding rates were greater among the mixed-Catholic marriages as determined by the religious affiliations of the brides. All differences exceeded the three per cent criteria used for the endogamous marriage comparisons. The mean difference in civil wedding rates between the two inter-religious marriage types was 14.6%. The corresponding difference between the two religious endogamous marriage types was 3.6 percent.
DISCUSSION
The two primary hypotheses were supported. Within the limits of the present analyses, migratory marriages and civil wedding rates were associated with low religious endogamy. Additional tests of these relationships with separate and joint controls on ages of brides at marriage and status levels of grooms provided additional support for the two hypotheses. As anticipated, greater support for the hypotheses was found in the Catholic marriage populations than in the church-Protestant marriage populations.
In turn, migratory marriage, as measured in this investigation, was related to younger ages at marriages. Also, civil weddings were separately and jointly associated with the extremes in the ages of brides at marriage and with lower status levels of grooms. The foregoing relationships suggest that deviation from one mate selection or marriage norm is related to deviations from other relevant norms. Ages at marriage, migratory marriages, civil weddings, status levels, and inter-religious marriages apparently are independently and jointly related to one another. These relationships pro-

82 Chancellor, Burchinal

vide additional support for the plausibility of the reference group theory used to develop the hypotheses.
Field research is needed to test these relationships more precisely and, if possible, to establish the direction of influence among the associated variables. The relationships among the variables studied suggest that younger ages at marriages, migratory marriages, civil weddings, and inter-religious marriages reflect greater emphasis on immediate gratifications associated with marriage, perhaps more impulsive marriage decisions, and certainly less cognizance or acceptance of conventional values and norms associated with social control over mate selection and marriage in the United States. The conventional values are reflected in marriages during one's twenties, in the bride's home town and, hence, state of residence, in church-sanctioned marriages, and in religiously endogamous marriages.
Whether marriage decisions should follow these or contrary norms is a value question. The present data cannot be used to answer this question. However, the present data have specific relevance to some of the value questions related to inter-religious dating and marriage which are frequently discussed in some marriage and family life education programs. An implicit assumption of some of these programs is that persons should be discouraged from seriously contemplating an inter-religious marriage. In general, church-related programs can be expected to focus more sharply on efforts to reduce inter-religious marriage rates. But the implicit bias against inter-religious marriages apparently extends into the marriage and family textbooks (Vernon, 1960). If the intent of any educational or counseling program is to reduce inter-religious marriage rates, the pres-

ent data suggest that such programs must begin with the recognition that entry into an inter-religious marriage is a function of one's general orientation to American marriage norms and expected satisfactions associated with personal interaction in marriage. Specific programs of education or counseling which are designed to increase the saliency of the religious endogamy norm will most likely come closest to attaining their objectives if basic education related to dating, courtship, marriage, and family relations are emphasized rather than if efforts are primarily concentrated on the negative factors associated with interreligious marriages in the United States.
For those who adhere to the value position of minimizing inter-religious marriages, other satisfactory results may also follow from broadly defined educational and counseling programs. Very likely young marriages (Burchinal, 1959, 1960), migratory marriages, and civil ceremonies will also be reduced, Apart from value commitments to either reducing or ignoring inter-religious marriage rates, all persons interested in the strength of the American family will agree that basic programs of family life education and effective counseling services provide a stronger basis for successful and enduring marriage relationships, whether these marriages are religiously endogamous or inter-religious marriages. Some researchers think inter-religious marriage rates will increase (Hoover, 1950; Thomas, 1951; Heer, 1960). If they are correct, basic education experiences for learning methods of constructive problem-solving, which may be applied to resolving differences in inter-religious marriages, will contribute to strengthening American family life.

marriages conducted in Iowa from 1953 through 1957 were used in the present study. These data were used to define three spousal religious affiliation categories: endogamous Catholic or churchProtestant marriages; marriages of Catholic and church-Protestants; and marriages of Catholics or church-Protestants with persons who indicated they were
Protestants, but who failed to provideany specific denominational affiliation; or persons who indicated no religious affiliation. Marriage record data for these couples were used to test relationships between inter-religious marriage rates and migratory marriage and civil ceremony rates. The data were also used to test relationships between ages of brides at marriage, status levels of grooms, and civil wedding rates, and between ages of brides at marriage and migratory marriage rates.
For the total populations and at each of several age levels, smaller proportions of the inter-religiously married couples included resident Iowa brides. Migratory marriages were observed considerably more frequent among the youngest brides as compared with the older brides. Civil wedding rates were greater among inter-religiously married couples than among the religiously endogamous married couples. This generalization remained when controls for the ages of the brides and status levels of the grooms were separately and jointly applied. In turn, civil weddings were greater among brides at the extreme youngest or oldest age levels and among couples involving lower status grooms. Lowest civil wedding rates were found among marriages

represented by brides between 23 and29
years of age who were married to high
status grooms.
The relations among migratory mar-
riages, civil ceremonies, inter-religious
marriages, younger ages at marriage, and
low status levels of grooms were inter-
preted as supporting a more general con-
ceptual relationship. This relationship
is that religious endogamy is related to
more general orientations toward mar-
riage. These orientations, in turn, are
a function of one's reference group ex-
periences.
