MALE ATTITUDES TOWARD FAMILY LIMITATION IN EAST PAKISTAN

"Higher fertility performance is quite common where effective birth control is not practised" (Coaleand Hoover, 1958, p. 50, note 9).
With a census-enumerated population of 50,840,235 in 1961, East Pakistan is one of the world's most densely populated regions. Its population density averaged 979 persons per square mile in 1961 (Census of Pakistan, 1961a).* This is particularly important when about 95 per cent of its rapidly growing population still live in the rural areas, directly and indirectly depending on agriculture for livelihood (Census of Pakistan, 1961b).2 During the intercensal period 1951-1961, East Pakistan's population grew at an average rate of 1.93 per cent a year, mainly because of a rapid decline in mortality and a continually constant high birth rate (Ahmed, 1962; Ahmed,
In the preparation of this paper, we have received generous comments and valuable suggestions from Dr. Clyde V. Riser of the Milbank Memorial Fund, Mr. W. Parker Mauldin of the Population Council, Professor L. Broom of University of Texas, and Dr. J. C. Caldwell of Australian National University. However, the authors assume full responsibility for collection, analysis, and interpretation of the data. The senior author is a (Visiting) Research Fellow in the Department of Demography at the Australian National University at Canberra, on leave from his position as Reader in Economics at the University of Rajshahi in East Pakistan.
1 Since a considerable section of East Pakistan consists of riverine swamps (3,205 square miles or 6% of 55,126 square miles land area), in computing the population density these riverine areas are excluded. Including these areas, its density was about 922 persons per square mile in 1961.
2 In 1961 more than 85% of East Pakistan's civilian labor force was engaged in agriculture directly, while most of the nonagricultural labor force derived their livelihood indirectly from agriculture.

1963; Krotki, 1963).3 The decline in mortality is mostly a result of the checks in the recurrence of widespread famines and epidemics which, for centuries, suppressed population growth (Census of Pakistan, 1951; Ahmed, 1962).4 This is especially so when, despite considerable betterment, expansion of medical, health, and sanitary measures as well as widespread use of antibiotics are still highly limited or mostly nonexistent in the remote villages.
Various practices of intentional family limitation are still unknown among the masses of population in East Pakistan. However, many people intrinsically feel the unusual burden of increasing family size of recent years; do not desire an unlimited number of children; and think of family planning, wondering if they could get some means quite easily and secretly, at no cost. This is especially important when the practice of family limitation through abortion which was found in Japan, Korea, and elsewhere is nonexistent in East Pakistan (Hong and Yoon, 1962; Gopalaswami, 1959; Koya, 1962).
3East Pakistan's 1951 birth and death rates were estimated as 59 and 46 per thousand population. For 1961 Krótki estimated a birth rate of 58 and a death rate of 32 per thousand population.
4Until recently, East Pakistan's population growth remained around 7% a decade; the highest, 17.9% during the decade 1931-41, and the lowest, 0.1% during the decade 1941-51, were marked by overenumeration in the first decade for political reasons and by famines and emigration in the second decade.

THE INTERVIEWED POPULATION
This paper presents the findings of a survey of the male attitude toward family limitation in East Pakistan, conducted toward the end of 1963. A group of highly qualified male interviewers interviewed 195 married males aged 20 to 54 years currently living with their wives. Widowed and polygamous men were excluded from the sample. The interviewers were asked to ascertain interviewee's age, if required, by reference to various important events, as age tends to be misreported in the population. Therefore, they could interview only those men who met the age and marital status qualifications and who willingly agreed to cooperate with interviewers in disclosing their personal characteristics.
By various population characteristics, the interviewed population differed somewhat from the general population and indicated a superior qualitative composition. They were more urbanized and educated than East Pakistan's population. They had higher occupational level and income per capita. The younger generation was somewhat overrepresented, and non-Muslims were underrepresented among the interviewed population. These factors must be kept in mind in evaluating the findings of this investigation.

The interviewed population had 646 ever-born children: 549 living and 97 dead (Table 1). About 17.7% of the ever-born children were dead when the interview was taken. Child mortality was higher in larger families. About 24 percent of the ever-born offspring among 13 couples with 8 to 11 ever-born children died as against 12 per cent among 111 couples with 2 to 5 ever-born children. As tested by chi-square values, coefficient of contingency, and coefficient of correlates, the number of ever-born children showed no significant association with education, occupation, and income but indicated high association with demographic factors such as the number of living children, the number of living sons, the age, and the number of years married (Table 2).
In addition to various socioeconomic and demographic characteristics such as age, education, income, occupation, years married, number of ever-born children, number of living children, and number of living sons, these 195 married males in the sample were asked several questions about their attitudes toward desire for children and birth control. Their responses are here examined and analyzed in relation to their socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Table 2 presents a summary view of asso-

ciations among the various characteristics of the sample population.
The desire for children showed closest association with such factors as the number of ever-born children, the number of living children, the number of living sons, the age, and the number of years married and limited association with factors such as income, education, and occu-

pation (Morrison, 1956; Hong and Yoon, 1962).

resent East Pakistan's masses, they at least reflected the pattern of attitude formation toward the desire for children and family limitation in the population as its socioeconomic and demographic features underwent changes during the preliminary period of the breakup of the tradition-bound and closed social setup (Chandrasekharan, 1952; Chandrasekhar, 1952; Agarwala, 1961; Patel, 1963).
THE DESIRE FOR CHILDREN
Number of Living and Ever-Born Children
Of 195 married males aged 20 to 54 years, 68 (34.9%) did not want additional children (see Table 3). The desire for children seems closely related to the number of living offspring already in the family. With increase in the realized family size, the desire for additional children declined. All but two males with 0 to 1 offspring desired additional progeny. Among families with 2 to 3 children, seven out of ten desired more offspring, while among couples with 4 to 5 children, seven out of ten expressed satisfaction with their present family size. But 4 of 20 males with 6 to 11 children already in the family still desired additional offspring. However, in the population as a whole, while about 86% of men with 0 to 3 children desired more offspring, about 72% with 4 and more desired no more. The critical change in attitude toward the desirability for more children seems to occur at the level of 4 living children. Thus, the desire for children in the traditional society is not always unlimited, even though their arrival in the family unit has hardly any rational limitation other than a physiological one.
The chi-square value between the desire for more progeny and the number of ever-born children (both living and

dead) in the interviewed population was 78.8, thus indicating no probability whatsoever of their significant association having occurred by chance (Table 4). This is quite expected, since the number of living children and the number of living sons depend on the number of ever-born offspring in the family. While 83% of men with 2 to 3 ever-born children desired more progeny, only 36% with 4 to 5 did so; the change in the desire took place with 5 ever-born children (Morrison, 1956).
That people do not intentionally desire more progeny never means that they would have no more offspring. There are considerable differences between desire and action in a population in which means to put desire into action not only are nonexistent and hardly practiced, but are looked upon with considerable caution and awe at first, which seems to be the case with almost all new things.
Number of Living Sons
A highly significant association was observed between the desire for additional children and the number of living sons in the family, the relationship being stronger than that between the desire for children and the realized family size (Table 3). Irrespective of income, education, and occupation, a stronger preference for male offspring was common among the population. About 71% of males who desired more children really desired more sons. Among 90 men in this group, 67% wanted more sons for economic reasons such as dependence in old age, security of the family, and so on; 29% considered daughters as burdensome and costly, rendering no return to the family; and only 15% desired more sons for a balanced family of both sexes. About 86% of males with 4 to 7 sons desired no additional children, while

Family Limitation in Pakistan

89% o£ men with only one son desired more children. Two males with 4 to 7 sons who desired more children and four sonless males who desired no more were quite atypical of their respective groups. In general, a strong manifestation of the traditional desire for more male progeny in the family was clearly observed in the population.
Preference for male offspring in the traditional way of life has its rational basis. A village family with more sons can develop a clan and diversify the occupation for living; farmers may use their surviving sons to run after their cattle when they can barely walk; and almost everybody wants more sons to support the min old age. While the parents expect a return from sons for bearing and rearing them, daughters leave the parents' home after marriage and hardly repay them for their troubles and sacrifices. On the other hand, a son's marriage brings fortune to the family in terms of a helper in household affairs to the mother of the family and also in terms of ornaments, furniture, and dowry that accompany the daughter-inlaw. The contrary is the case with daughters, which renders them burdensome and costly.
Duration of Marriage
The association between years married and desire for children was also highly significant in the population (Table 3). This is quite expected, since realized family size increased with duration of marriage and, therefore, deliberate aspiration for additional offspring declined. Thus, all males married for less than five years desired more children, while none married for more than 25 years did so. Ten males married for 5 to 9 years who desired no more children were atypical of their group. Two of them had no

living son at all. Therefore, by all indications, these males were nontraditional in their value orientation. On the other hand, four men married for 20 to 24 years desired additional progeny. Their desire for an increased number of children was influenced somewhat by their higher income, which would enable them to support a large family, and by their preference for more sons. They had a mean income of Rs 3,700/- a year and an average of 5.0 children (2.8 sons), and they desired an average of 1.6 additional offspring (0.8 sons) at least. Out of 18 males married for 15 to 19 years, six desired more children, the desire for more male progeny in the family accounting for their break from the main group.
Father's Age
Since the number of ever-born children, the number of living children, the number of living sons, and the duration of marriage are related to father's age, the latter must have significant association with the desire for additional offspring in the family (Morrison, 1956; Hong and Yoon, 1962). This is evident from the fact that all but one aged 20 to 24 years desired more offspring, while none aged 45 years and over did so. The exceptional man in the age group 20 to 24 was a 22-year-old Muslim tea-stall keeper, who had been married for about five years, had no children, and desired none. He had an annual income of Rs 600/- to support a joint family with several brothers and sisters dependent on him after the death of his father, who had been a day laborer. It seems that circumstances made him temporarily a pessimist towards life, angry with his dead father who had had too many children and left them as his responsibility after death. Five males aged 25 to 29

years who desired no more progeny were exceptions to their group. They had an average of 3.0 children (2.0 sons), their satisfied urge for male progeny accounting partly for their desire. On the other hand, six of seven males aged 40 to 44 years who desired more children strongly desired more sons for their family. Among males aged 30 to 39 years, six out of ten desired more children, while, among males aged 40 to 44 years, six out of ten were satisfied with their realized family size.
Education
Education, occupation, and income were significantly associated with desire for children at the 5% probability level, thus suggesting limited influence of these socioeconomic factors in changing the traditional pattern of attitude formation toward the desire for children in the family (Table 3). Therefore, it seems important to illustrate the pattern of association of these socioeconomic variables with attitudes towards the family size in the population.
In descending order of representation, illiterates, graduates, and matriculates were the largest three groups that accounted for 61.5% (120 males) of the sample population. A cross-tabulation of the desire for children by father's educational attainments apparently indicated that the desire for additional progeny increased considerably with educational levels. Thus, while 51.2% of illiterates desired more children, the proportion was 68.4% among matriculates and 84.6% among graduates, a phenomenon quite contrary to the belief that the desire for additional offspring in the family tends to decrease with educational betterment.
Among illiterates, matriculates, and graduates with desire for more children,

illiterates had the lowest mean age and mean marriage duration but the largest desired family size (4-5 children including 2.8 sons). While desired family size was smallest among graduates, intergroup difference was quite small. On the contrary, among these three educational groups with desire for no more progeny, realized family size was largest among graduates (5.5 children including 2.5 sons) and smallest among illiterates (4.1 children with 2.5 sons). Therefore, irrespective of educational attainments, ex ante and ex post family size depended largely on the realization of the desired number of male offspring in the family.
Among these three educational groups, matriculates exceeded both illiterates and graduates in the desired family size. Matriculates desired 4.6 children with 2.7 sons as against 4.4 children with 2.6 sons desired by illiterates and 4.2 children with 2.5 sons by graduates. Therefore, it seems that the desired family size in the tradition-bound population could register a slight increase during the initial stage of educational advancement before it would start declining with further improvement in tradition-breaking educational attainments.
It is important to note that the desire for children may not identify itself with a desire for an ultimate realized family size, because the latter may far exceed the desired family size in a traditionbound population whose reproductive performances hardly react to socioeconomic changes in the short run. In addition, ex post family size depends considerably on the realization of a sufficient number of sons in the family.
Income
In the interviewed population, income indicated better association than education with desire for children. In no

income group was there an absolute majority of those who desired no more progeny (Table 3). But, from lowest to highest income range, their proportion declined from 43.7% to 26.2%, thus apparently indicating a possibility of positive association between income and desire for more children. The income level Rs 3,000/- to 3,999/- a year had the highest proportion of those who desired no more progeny.
Interincome group difference in attitudes toward desire for children were not always consistent with established facts. Among those who desired no more children, realized family size was smallest among the lowest income group (3.8 children with 2.0 sons) who had a mean age of 36.8 years and a mean marriage duration of 17.1 years; the highest income group had the second largest family size; while, along with the highest mean age and mean marriage duration of 42.3 years and 18.9 years respectively, the income group Rs 2,000/- to 2,999/- had the largest family size of 5.8 children (2.7 sons). Among those who desired more children, desired family size was largest among the income group Rs 3,000/- to 3,999/- a year (4.8 children including 2.8 sons).
Among the income groups as a whole, the income group Rs 3,000/- to 3,999/had the largest desired family size, 5.2 children (2.9 sons), as against 3.9 children (2.2 sons) among the lowest income group, 4.8 children (2.6 sons) among the income group Rs 2,000/- to 2,999/-, and 4.4 children (2.5 sons) among the highest income group. Therefore, it is possible that, even though a short-run phenomenon, ex ante and ex post family size in recently developing economies could increase during the initial stage of income growth until aspiration for a better life would effectively influence the traditional population.

Income and various sociodemographic variables were cross-tabulated to test the significance of their association (Table 2). Income showed closer association with education and occupation (significant at P=.01). It also snowed significant association with the number of living children (significant at P=.05); this could be a result of lower infant and childhood mortality among higher income groups. Service holders and teachers who had comparatively fixed but assured income-flow formed 71.4% of the highest income group, while businessmen predominated the income group Rs 3,000/- to 3,999/- a year. By education, graduates formed 69.0% of the highest income group, while matriculates were more within income group Rs 3,000/- to 3,999/- a year. The lowest income group was composed mostly of illiterates.
Occupation
Among socioeconomic characteristics, occupation showed the closest association with the desire for children. Those who desired no more progeny were a minority in all but one occupation group, agriculturists with by-occupations being an exception. In addition, their proportion was comparatively higher in occupations such as manual labor and cultivation (48.3% and 45.5%) and lower in teaching and service (30.0% and 24.2%), thus apparently implying direct association between nonagricultural skilled occupations and desire for more offspring (Table 3). In other words, the proportion of those who desired more children was quite high among teachers and service holders, two occupational groups with a comparatively fixed but assured income-flow. However, desired family size was largest among agriculturists in general.

In the sample, agriculturists, service holders, and teachers formed about 61% of the population. Among those who desired no more progeny in these groups, agriculturists had the largest realized family size of 5.3 children including 3.2 sons. On the other hand, teachers and service holders were satisfied with an average of 4.8 children each (2.6 and 2.2 sons, respectively). Among those who desired more progeny, ex ante family size was larger among agriculturists who desired a family of at least 4.8 children including 3.0 sons. In contrast, service holders and teachers desired a family of at least 4.1 children each (2.4 and 2.7 sons, respectively). Finally, among the occupational groups as a whole, agriculturists desired a family of 5.0 children (3.1 sons) as against 4.3 children (2.5 sons) desired by the service holders and 4.4 children (2.5 sons) by the teachers. This pattern of difference could be explained mostly by the stronger desire for sons among agriculturists, sons being most important for their occupational survival.
Thus, larger desired and realized family size was common among agriculturists. This was a result of unsatisfied desire for sons in the family, sons being most vital to their living. Therefore, their realized family size must increase so long as desire for more sons remained unfulfilled.
ATTITUDES TOWARD BIRTH CONTROL
Responses to questions on the desirability of birth control and family planning must be shrouded with various qualifications in a traditional population, because most people hardly know of birth control as a deliberate policy mechanism, lack a full understanding of what it means in practice, and are still uncertain of its place vis-à-vis social

traditions and religious doctrines. However, it is not difficult to ascertain their attitude toward birth control for family limitation if provisions for easy, free, and secret birth control facilities could be made readily available around them. Of course, a liking for birth control for family limitation does not imply its adoption and practice in real life when people lack basic understanding of its various methods and facilities. However, the authors feel that a favorable attitude toward family limitation may be created through an effective and well-managed health education program designed to enlighten the people on the purpose, problems, methods, and desirability of birth control. This seems especially important for those who are willing to adopt family planning if they could get some easy and acceptable methods (Mauldin, 1963; Nortman, 1964).
About 73.3% of the sample population (143 males) expressed a favorable attitude towards birth control for family limitation (Table 4). Of all socioeconomic and demographic factors, only four variables: number of children, number of sons, education, and occupation indicated signficant association with desire for birth control.
Education
Education showed the closest association with willingness to adopt birth control for family limitation, the relationship being significant at the 1% probability level. Thus, while 53.5% of illiterates were favorably inclined towards birth control, the proportion was 67.4% among nonmatriculates, 84.2% among matriculates, and 92.3% among graduates (Table 4). Therefore, though the population was still traditional and means of family limitation were almost

Vol. 12, No. 4

Family Limitation in Pakistan

nonexistent, the desire for birth control at some stage was quite widespread. A negative attitude towards birth control was expressed by 46.5% of illiterates, 35.3% of nonmatriculates, 15.8% of matriculates, and 7.7% of graduates; the proportion of those who did not favor birth control gradually decreased with increased educational attainments.
Three graduates who were unwilling to adopt birth control for family planning were atypical of their group. They considered birth control an act against God's Will. Graduates who favored birth control were younger than those who opposed it, while the reverse was true among illiterates.
Thus, while illiterates were not always hostile towards birth conrtol policy, the magnitude of favorable inclination toward family limitation increased with educational attainments. In all educational groups, ex ante family size was larger among those who opposed family planning; this intergroup difference could hardly be explained by variations in age and years married. Among those who were unwilling to adopt birth control, mean age and mean marriage duration were highest among graduates and lowest among illiterates, while the reverse was the position among those who favored family limitation. In other words, illiterates were slower than graduates to form a favorable attitude toward birth control. As usual, irrespective of attitude towards family planning, those who desired more progeny were younger than those who did not.
Occupation
Occupation also showed close association with favorable attitude towards family limitation (significant at P=.O1). Thus, while 63.6% of pure cultivators favored birth control, 73.9% of businessmen, 84.4% of service holders, and

85.0% of teachers did the same, the proportion increasing with skill and training required for the work.5 Those who were not favorably inclined towards birth control were a minority in all but one occupational group (agriculturists with by-occupations); they formed a large proportion of laborers also (Table 4). Since education showed positive association with favorable attitude toward birth control, the rationale behind a comparatively stronger disliking of these groups for a deliberate policy of family limitation could be explained partly by their educational attainments. Among laborers, 79.3% were illiterates, while the proportion was 33.3% among agriculturists with by-occupations as against 31.8% among pure cultivators. But 55.0% of the unskilled work-groups (cultivators, agriculturists with by-occupations, and laborers) favored family planning. Therefore, a negative attitude towards family limitation was expressed by 45.0% of unskilled groups, 26.1% of businessmen, 15.2% of service holders, and 15.0% of teachers. Those who favored birth control were younger in age and had comparatively more literates among them. Illiterates and primary literates formed about one-third of businessmen as against only one-tenth of service holders; therefore, the proportion of persons with a negative attitude toward family limitation was higher among businessmen than among service holders.
Income
Though income did not show a significant association with a favorable attitude towards birth control, it seems to have had a direct relation with a desire for family limitation. While 65.6% of the
5 About 58.1% of all agriculturists (pure cultivators and agriculturists with by-occupations) favored birth control policy.

lowest income group favored family planning, this proportion was 85.7% among the highest income group, the proportion increasing with income. Thus, a negative attitude toward birth control was taken by 34.4% of the lowest income group, as against only 14.3% of the highest income group (Table 4). Only 6 of 42 men within the income range Rs 4,000/- and over were unwilling to adopt birth control. A comparison of those who favored and those who opposed family limitation among the lowest income group showed that illiterates constituted 73% (8 men) of 11 couples who disliked birth control, as against 43% (9 men) of 21 persons who favored family limitation in the group. In sum, higher income groups had comparatively more literates, more skilled people, and more persons with favorable attitude towards family limitation. Intraincome group differences in attitude towards family planning also could be explained mostly by differences in educational attainments and occupational pursuits.
Family Size
Among demographic characteristics, family size and the number of living sons showed significant associations with attitude towards birth control (significant at P=.O5). Those who opposed family limitation were a minority in all family size groups, but their proportion was highest (45.0% among men with 6 to 11 children and lowest (15.9% among males with 2 to 3 offspring (Table 4). However, excluding the group with 6 to 11 progeny, this association ceases to be significant. Apparently, a favorable attitude towards birth control decreased with increased family size.
Among two extreme groups (men with 0 to 1 and 6 to 11 children), those who favored birth control formed 66.2% of

the first group and 55.0% of the second group. This difference could be explained partly by the fact that both educational and occupational quality was better among the first group. While 53.8% of men with 0 to 1 children were highly literate (matriculates and over), the proportion was only 45.0% among males with 6 to 11 progeny. Second, about 76.2% of males in the first group were businessmen, service holders, and teachers, as against 65.0% in the second group. Third, males with 0 to 1 offspring were much younger (26.5 years mean age and 43.3 years mean marriage duration) than males with 6 to 11 offspring (mean age: 42.8 years and mean marriage duration: 20.8 years).
Educational and occupational quality was higher among men with 2 to 3 offspring (46.0% matriculates and over and 68.2% skilled workers) than it was among males with 4 to 5 children (38.2% matriculates and over and 60.9% skilled persons). Therefore, as against 84.1% of the first group, only 76.6% of the second group favored family planning. In contrast, those who desired additional progeny formed 73.0% of the first group but only 29.8% of the second family size group. Among those who opposed birth control in these groups, matriculates and over formed 20.0% of men with 2 to 3 offspring as against 9.1% of males with 4 to 5 offspring, and skilled workers constituted 50.0% of the first group as against 27.3% of the second group. This difference is well explained by the fact that while 90.0% of the first group desired more progeny, the proportion was only 27.3% in the second group. Thus, other things remaining the same, the family size alone could not generate a desire for birth control in the interviewed population.
To check this finding, a chi-square was run on the association between different

Vol. 12, No. 4

pairs of family size groups in Table 4 and their attitude under consideration. Chi-square values for men with 4 to 5 and 6 to 11 children (3.11) and for men with 2 to 3 and 4 to 5 offspring (0.96) are not significant even at the 5% probability level. But the chi-square value for men with 0 to 1 and 2 to 3 children (5.49) is significant at the 1% probability level.
Number of Living Sons
Attitude toward birth control showed closer association with the number of living sons than with the realized size of family, because, in the determination of realized family size, sons were most important. Up to the group with two sons, the proportion of those who favored family limitation continuously increased with the number of sons in the family. Even though those who favored birth control were a majority in all groups, their proportion was lowest among males with three sons, and it was not very high among men with 4 to 7 sons. Therefore, these groups need close scrutiny.
The group with three sons (22 males) were highly backward in educational and occupational quality. They had the lowest proportion of matriculates and over 31.8%). Six of 22 were illiterates, while agriculturists and manual laborers formed 45.5% of the group (10 males). Therefore, despite more sons, those who opposed family planning were comparatively more predominant among men with three sons (Table 4). The group with 4 to 7 sons had 57.1% matriculates and over, but agriculturists and laborers formed 49.9% of the group. Their occupational composition was thus highly unfavorable to the formation of a sympathetic attitude toward birth control. In sum, those who favored birth control were qualitatively superior to

those who opposed it; therefore, qualitative inferiority coupled with older age kept many people with more than two sons tradition-bound and averse to the idea of family limitation.
Number of Ever-Born Children, Age, and Duration of Marriage
Demographic characteristics such as number of ever-born children, age, and years married showned no statistically significant association with attitude toward birth control (Table 4). However, those who disliked birth control were a minority in all groups classified by the number of ever-born children or by the age of the father. But one group of males classified by the number of years married had an absolute majority of those who were unfavorably inclined toward family limitation (those married for 25 years and over), because eight of ten males in the group were agriculturists-laborers and undermatriculates. On the other hand, about one-third of males married for 0 to 4 years did not favor birth control, because many newly married couples wanted children before they would think of family limitation. This is quite evident from the fact that all of them desired children and that all but two had no offspring whatsoever. This fact could partly explain the somewhat higher proportion of those who were unwilling to adopt birth control in the young age group, 20 to 24 years old. However, qualitative characteristics of the population were most important in this attitude formation differential, agriculturists-laborers and undermatriculates being somewhat predominant in these groups.
Conclusion
In conclusion, it might be stated that, in addition to the formation of a favor-

able attitude toward desire for birth control, the acceptance of family limitation program by the majority of the population depends considerably on the ready availability of some easy and secretly usable technique. No method that is troublesome, contrary to the social custom of the physical seclusion of woman, and also costly would have wide appeal.
THE OVERALL PICTURE
This paper is an attempt to examine several socioeconomic and demographic variables of the interviewed population generally believed to be associated with desire for additional progeny on the one hand and with willingness to adopt family limitation on the other. Out of 195 married males aged 20 to 54 years in the sample, about 34.9% desired no more offspring, while almost 73.3% expressed direct willingness to adopt birth control if they were freely provided with some easy and secret means of family limitation. All variables considered for this analysis-- ever-born children, family size, living sons, years married, age, income, education, and occupation-- showed significant association with attitude toward desire for additional progeny, while four of these eight--education, occupation, living children, and living sons--indicated significant association with attitude toward family limitation (Table 2).
Sixty-eight persons who desired no more progeny differed considerably from 127 males who desired more children. In the attitude formation toward desire for no more offspring, demographic factors --number of living children and particularly number of living sons, age, and years married--were more important than socioeconomic factors such as income, education, and occupation. On the contrary, it seems that these socio-

economic factors tended to generate an increased desire for additional offspring by expanding the father's capability to support a larger family. However, this phenomenon could be a short-run one in a rapidly developing economy with its tradition-bound population still adhering to age-old ideas and thoughts.
These 68 persons, with a mean age of 38.1 years and a mean marriage duration of 16.1 years, had already an average of 5.5 ever-born children, 4.6 living children, and 2.5 living sons. On the other hand, 127 males who desired more offspring had a mean age of 29.3 years, a mean marriage duration of 6.6 years, an average of 2.2 ever-born children, 1.8 living children, and 0.9 sons in the family. Thus, the latter group had rational demographic reasons for their desire. Second, the average family and per capita income of those who desired more progeny were Rs 2,975/- and Rs 772/a year, respectively, as against Rs 2,462/and Rs 371/- per year, respectively, of those who desired no more children (Table 5). In other words, the desire for additional progeny was stronger among comparatively higher income groups. Third, differences between the groups by education and occupation were also important. In the population, about 46.7% were matriculates, undergraduates, and graduates as against 53.6% among those who desired, and 33.8 per cent among those who did not desire, additional offspring. Fourth, agriculturists and laborers formed 31.3% of the interviewed population, 24.2% of those who desired more progeny, and 44.1%of those who did not desire more progeny. It seems, however, that a comparatively stronger desire for additional offspring among higher income and educationaloccupational groups could be explained partly by differences in their demographic characteristics such as family

size, number of living sons, age, and years married. Though figures were somewhat rough, those who desired additional progeny wanted an average of at least 2.5 additional offspring including 1.7 sons over an average of 1.8 children including 0.9 sons already in the family. In other words, their ex ante family size (4.3 children including 2.6 sons) was smaller than ex post family size of those who desired no more children (4.6 offspring including 2.5 sons). But, most important, they desired a slightly larger number of sons, the factor that would ultimately determine their realized family size.
Among 127 males who desired more children, 91 men (71.7%) favored birth control, while 36 men (28.3%) did not. On the other hand, of 68 males who desired no more progeny, 76.5%(52 men) favored birth control, while 23.5%(16 men) did not. Educational and occupational standard was better among those

who desired more children, but their family size, number of living sons, mean age, mean marriage duration, and per capita income were lower than those who desired no more progeny.
Out of 195 married males, 52 persons opposed, and 143 favored, birth control. These two groups differed substantially in educational attainments, occupational quality, and income level, while demographic variables were hardly a distinguishing feature of them (Table 6). First, matriculates, undergraduates, and graduates formed 23.1%of those who opposed birth control as against 55.3% of those who favored it. Thus, educational attainment and a positive attitude toward birth control showed a direct relationship. This is further evident from the fact that matriculates and over constituted 42.3% of those who favored family limitation and desired no more progeny, while only 6.3% of those who opposed birth control and desired no

more children were matriculates and over. Second, agriculturists and laborers were 23.6% of those who favored family planning, as against 51.9% of those who were opposed; thus a negative attitude toward family limitation was stronger among inferior occupational group. Agriculturists-cum-laborers formed 87.5% of males who opposed birth control and desired no more progeny, as against 69.2% of those who opposed family planning and desired more children. Finally, average family income was higher among those who favored birth control (Rs 3,127/- a year) than that among males who opposed it (Rs 1,876/a year). Otherwise, demographic differences between the groups with opposite attitudes towards birth control were very limited.
Among those who opposed birth control, two distinct groups could be identified: (1) Some people disliked the idea of family limitation for religious and

superstitious reasons. They were highly traditional in value orientation and had a very limited understanding of environment. (2) Some persons were not favorably inclined towards family planning because they wanted children immediately, so never thought of family limitation as a necessity. On the other hand, among those who favored birth control, two important groups could be distinguished: (1) those who favored birth control for immediate family limitation, and (2) those who wanted it for childspacing (to postpone immediate childbirth for various reasons).
In essence, that birth control is not permitted by God does not automatically imply that everybody would be unwilling to adopt it. Only a few dogmatic believers might remain hostile to family limitation as a policy matter. An effective campaign for birth control would surely reduce their number to insignificance.

CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS
Two opposite forces were found operating in the population onthe formation of attitude toward desire for children. First, demographic forces such as expanding family size, age, andyears married tended to depress the desire for additional offspring, but they didnot necessarily generate a favorable attitude toward birth control. This is especially so because people become easily adjusted to changed circumstances. Due to their fatalistic attitude towards life--a common social phenomenon in the population--they seem habituated to consider both good and bad as emanating from God; therefore, they would rarely complain much against events they could not mold or change. However, though highly traditional, they were not so irrational as to desire an unlimited number of children in the family quite deliberately. On the other hand, when children were born as usual, they would gladly accept them as a gift from God and thus would depend on Him for their survival anddeath. Second, these tradition-bound people were not, however, arbitrarily opposed to birth control universally. On the contrary, since various means andmethods of family limitation were mostly beyond their imagination, knowledge, and understanding, they hardly thought of it in any way. In other words, not a complete absence of desire, but an utter ignorance about birth control as such was their basic problem for a favorable attitude formation toward effective family limitation undertakings.
