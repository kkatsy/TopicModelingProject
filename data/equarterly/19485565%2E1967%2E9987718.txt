The suggestion by Alland (1967) that the resistance to stress exhibited by schizophrenics is not genetic in origin but is a phenomenon induced by electrocoma and insulin shock therapy creates new complications for the hypothesis of Huxley et al. (1964). This hypothesis, further developed by Osmond and Hoffer (1966), requires some gene-based physiological defense against stress and trauma to compensate for the dysgenic qualities associated with schizophrenia. It was Kety (1960, p. 123) who first emphasized that some of the distinguishing biochemical features of schizophrenia may have been due to the residual effects of electroconvulsive or insulin treatment. The classic research of Selye (1958) has repeatedly demonstrated that exposure to one agent may induce cross resistance to another.
Alland's recommendation (1967) that comparisons be made between shock treated and untreated schizophrenics is certainly sound though hard to implement since the latter category of patient scarcely exists. Even mildly disturbed patients routinely receive tranquilizers before hospitalization. Such patients would be poor controls since phenothiazine drugs can also influence adrenocortical function (Smith, Maickel, and Brodie, 1963).
It must be recognized, however, that not all studies on schizophrenics were on shocked patients. These therapies became widespread thirty years ago, and

many reports on stress-resistance are of earlier vintage, in particular the observations on the low incidence of allergies and rheumatoid arthritis. And in some cases shock treatment produces the reverse of the suggested effect, increasing reactivity to histamine (Lovett Doust, 1953) and to allergens (Kerman, 1946).
The hope expressed by Alland (1967) that the incidence of schizophrenia might be related to the quantity of stress in different populations occupying different environments is shared by all investigators. But even if reliable data on the incidence of schizophrenia could be compiled, it would still be necessary to gauge the degree of stress in each culture. Urbanization and migrancy are regarded as stressful situations, yet pepsinogen secretion which is an index of duodenal ulcération, gives only equivocal evidence that Indian detribalization and rootlessness have any influence on one stress sensitive physiological system (Kuttner, 1964; Kuttner and Mailander, 1965). Another problem is that cultures change rapidly and atypical personalities exert a feed-back influence on normal individuals, making even the diagnosis of normalcy difficult (Kuttner, 1960).
