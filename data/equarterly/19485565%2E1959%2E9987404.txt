FAMILIES WITH MANIC-DEPRESSIVE PSYCHOSIS

w,HETHER THERE IS A RELATION BE-
tween affective psychosis on the one hand and marriage and propagation on the other hand has long been a matter of interest to psychiatrists. Pinel, for example, tells us that he was at pains to collect, between 1801 and 1805, statistics on this matter (which he reproduced in a table) but that, not knowing the proportion of single to married at given ages in the general population, he could not draw conclusions from the ratios he found among mental hospital patients: "On ne peut tirer dans les hospices aucune induction du rapport nume"rique observe" entre ces deux e"tats (mariage et celibat), en faveur d'une disposition plus ou moins grande a contracter la manie ou la melancolie." Nor, he said, could he properly draw any inference from the observation that among women patients with chronic and dementing processes there were many more spinsters than married women: but he suggests that marriage may have a prophylactic effect against inveterate forms of mental illness. Here we have the burden of many a subsequent discussion of marriage in this context. The point was succinctly expressed, eighty years later, by Kraepelin, then at the beginning of his career. "It is undeniable that in very many cases celibacy is to be regarded as the consequence of psychological immaturity or of a past or

still active mental illness. But marriage itself may have a prophylactic value, in spite of the risks it entails and the cares it brings with it: it gives greater satisfaction and security and saves people from excesses. It is the widowed and the separated who are most endangered, for they have often to bear nearly all the risks and troubles of marriage without enjoying any of its benefits."
A great deal of what has been written since consists of variations on that theme. It is true that our focus has altered and our field of interest widened: we have concerned ourselves as much with the patient's progeny and contributions to the genetic stock as with his personal well-being and hazards; we have tried to plumb his least accessible motives and dissect his social relations; and we have remembered that not all the mentally ill reach a mental hospital (Lewis, 1958). But the broad question is still being argued, chiefly in connection with schizophrenia. The mating habits and fecundity of those with affective disorders have received far less attention, which is surprising when we consider how manic excitement--or for that matter a sanguine hypomanic temperament--may predispose to ]heightened sexual activity and unrestraint, and how depression in contrast can militate against libidinal gratification.

Those who have addressed themselves to the problem are not yet unanimous as to whether manic-depressives differ appreciably from the normal population in the extent to which they marry and have children.
Where there is any dispute on this matter, we must all trundle our little wheelbarrows along to the great quarry which Essen-Moller has provided for us. No one has amassed such full and rigorously analyzed material as he in his unrivalled study o£ the fertility of manic-depressive, schizophrenic and epileptic patients in mental hospitals.
Now Essen-Moller's conclusions about manic-depressives were, summarily stated:
1. Their marriage rate is about normal before their illness; afterwards it falls to about half normal.
2. The length of the period following the illness does not affect the post-illness marriage rate.
3. The mortality rate after the illness is one and a half times higher than before the illness.
4. Before the illness the number of children of the married patients corresponds to that of the normal population: and in his series it diminished part passu with the general birth rate from the beginning of the century onwards.
5. After the illness the fecundity of the married patients is not less than it was before the illness.
6. Extramarital fecundity of manicdepressive women remains the same after the illness as it was before it.
And in general, he concludes 7. "The manic-depressives repro-

131
duce themselves about as much or as little as the rest of the population. Their lowered marriage-rate, and their raised mortality rate after the illness, have only a slight effect on their total reproduction because the age of onset for the illness is relatively advanced." (Essen-Moller, 1935)
A more recent investigator, Stenstedt, examined a smaller number of manicdepressives admitted to certain mental hospitals in South Sweden (Stenstedt, 1952). Like Landis and Page (1938), he found that married people were rather less frequent among them than in the general population, due allowance being made for age-distribution; but the difference was not statistically significant except in the married males. As to the fertility of those who married--the proportion of childless marriages and the number of live births for the married women among his manic-depressives were like those in the general population.
In a larger series drawn from mental hospitals serving populous areas of London, my colleague, the late Dr. Vera Norris (1956), calculated the age-standardized ratios of first-admission rates of single to those of married persons with manic-depressive psychosis: for men the ratio was 1.8, for women 1.6. In 0degaard's data (0degaard, 1946) the ratio was 1.5 for men, 1.3 for women. The preponderance of single persons in the London patients was evident in all agegroups except men and women under 30, of whom approximately the same percentage was single as in the corresponding general population of London. The discrepancy was greatest in men between 30 and 49: 34 per cent of the manic-depressive men of this age were single, as against only 17 per cent in the normal

male population of London. For manicdepressive women of this age-group the discrepancy was evident but less wide: There were 472 of them, 29.7 per cent of whom were single, as against 19.9 per cent single in the normal population.
It is fair to conclude from these and similar reported studies that the proportion of single men and women among manic-depressive patients admitted to mental hospitals tends to be higher than in the general population, but that the discrepancy is not gross, and is indeed hardly noticeable in the younger patients who have not yet entered on their fourth decade. Manic-depressive psychosis is therefore strikingly different from schizophrenia in these respects.
This finding in studies coming from several different countries is all the more impressive when we consider the wide variation in the apparent prevalence of manic-depressive psychosis in different regions.
Thus in Canada (Dominion Bureau of Statistics, 1954) manic-depressive patients account for only one-twelfth of all first admissions to mental hospitals, in contrast to schizophrenics who make up a quarter of all first admissions; similarly Dr. Kallmann expressed the opinion a few years ago, that "ordinarily this type of psychosis (manic-depressive) is known to be relatively infrequent, and is certainly less frequent than schizophrenia, even if the former diagnosis is applied quite liberally." (Kallmann, 1952) Yet in England and Wales (Registrar General 1955) it is the manic-depressives who amount to a quarter of all first admissions to mental hospitals, whereas schizophrenics contribute only a sixth of the first admissions. Whether we attribute this divergence to differences in diagnostic practice or to the administra-

tive and social factors that determine admission to hospital, it is remarkable that in spite of it English, Scandinavian and American data about marital status have so far revealed (with one exception) much the same state of affairs, so far as proportion of single to married patients is concerned, or ratio of first-admission rates for single to those for married manic-depressives. It may well be, of course, that data drawn from first admissions do not give a true picture, for Essen-Mdller observed that those patients who were judged to be manic-depressive in their first attack, but later found to be schizophrenic, had shown before the outbreak of their illness the same proportion of single to married as manicdepressives generally did, but after the illness behaved in this and other reproductive respects like typical schizophrenics.
The outstanding exception to the general findings about the fertility of manicdepressives is in Dr. Kallmann's twin data. From these he concluded that "manic-depressive twins and siblings marry less frequently, tend more often to remain childless when married, and produce fewer children if fertile, than is true for the non-psychotic persons among their co-twins and siblings, as well as for the general population. In fact, the fertility rates of our manic-depressive index cases are even lower than the corresponding rates of schizophrenic index cases." (Kallmann 1950, 1954) This is rather hard to reconcile with the conclusions from other studies, carried out with corresponding rigor. Three possibilities present themselves: (1) to take manicdepressive twins as propositi biases the sample of manic-depressives, since twins may have different reproductive behavior from non-twins; (2) the sample,

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:25 08 December 2015

consisting of 85 manic-depressive twin index cases, is perhaps unduly small for this purpose; or (3) the diagnosis of manic-depressive psychosis may have been made on different grounds from those adopted by Essen-Moller and other investigators. The first and third of these possibilities are evidently frafetched and unacceptable. We have no reason to suppose that twins, qua twins, marry less than other people or have fewer children, and Kallmann was exceptionally careful in applying, and explicit in stating, his criteria, both positive and negative, for diagnosing manicdepressive psychosis. Essen-Moller's criteria for delimiting his corresponding "nuclear" or typical group were mainly negative--exclusion of any with suspicious signs of schizophrenia--but even if this led to the inclusion of involutional psychoses which Kallmann would have excluded, it would have tended not to increase but to lower the age-standardized marriage and fertility rate. Similar considerations apply to Stanstedt's material. Whether the relative smallness of the sample of manic-depressive propositi in Kallmann's series could account to any degree for the discrepancy I am unable to judge, but it seems unlikely. In this dilemma, the prudent course seems to be to give more weight to the series which is larger and which can be followed up over a longer period. I believe, however, that Dr. 0degaard will tell us of some relevant, fresh material, more in keeping with Dr. Kallmann's finding.
Since the bulk of the data, apart from Dr. Kallmann's, derive from mental hospital patients, I thought it useful to take the total manic-depressive clientele of the Maudsley Hospital, where the number of outpatients diagnosed as manic-depressive is one and a third times

133
the number of inpatients with this diagnosis: in other words, many mild forms of the disease, which would not reach a mental hospital, are picked up in our outpatient department. Taking inpatients and outpatients together, there were, during the period 1949-1954, (Blacker & Gore, 1955; Blacker, 1957) 172 manic-depressive patients who had married between 1920 and 1929, and whose marriage had not been broken, by death or otherwise, before the woman reached the age of 45. It is evident from Tables 1 and 2, and Figure 1, (for which I am much indebted to Miss N. Goodman) that these patients, predominantly belonging to the Registrar General's social classes 2 and 3, did not differ in their fertility from the general population as recorded in the Family Census of the Royal Commission on Population. Nor is this a misleading comparison if the whole population of manic-depressives, single as well as married, are regarded. In the total sample of manicdepressive inpatients and outpatients at the Maudsley Hospital the proportion who were single, in the age-group 45-54 years, was practically the same, both for men (13 per cent) and for women (24 per cent), as for the population of the County of London, in which most of the patients lived (though appreciably higher than for the whole of England and Wales, where 9 per cent of men and 15 per cent of women of this age group are single).
There is, then, still room for doubt as to whether we have any striking quantitative departures to account for. Dr. 0degaard has, however, drawn attention to some points, which I hope he will elaborate in the ensuing discussion. He has, for example, in his illuminating papers on this topic, (0degaard, 1946,

1953) speculated about why the proportion of single persons is higher in men than in women in every diagnostic group except the senile psychoses; but his data show that though this is true for the total manic-depressive sample, it does not hold good for all the separate age-groups; the reverse relation, in fact, is found in the manic-depressive groups aged 31-40 and 51-60. Still closer to our present theme is his finding that in the prepsychotic personality of male patients sensitive and depressive types are twice as common among the married as among the single: "evidently their serious outlook on life, coupled with considerable depth of feeling and craving for human contact, are factors which are predisposing to marriage." In women, on the other hand, the trend seemed the other way. He also found that nearly half (48 per cent) of the manic-depressive men who were single had at some time been engaged to be married; so had over a third (37 per cent) of the manic-depressive women. As my colleague, D. L. Davies (1956), has shown, engagement tribulations often bespeak severe disorder in the emotional development of the personality.
There is further the question of whether marriages contracted by manicdepressives endure. The figures from our hospital (Blacker 1957) show that for the triennium 1952-1954, 82 per cent of manic-depressive patients who had ever married were still married when , they first attended the hospital, and that, of these more or less stable marriages, the average duration was 23 years for the manic-depressive men (of whom there were 377) and 21 years for the women (of whom there were 536): the average number of children born to these patients was 1.9. The divorced and separated, who represent some of the

failures of marriage, amounted to only 6.4 per cent of our male ever-married manic-depressive patients, and 6.3 per cent of the women: whereas for schizophrenia the corresponding figures at the Maudsley were nearly twice as high (11.5 per cent and 12.6 per cent), and for hysteria and abnormal personality appreciably higher, as you would expect. Similarly in Dayton's Massachusetts patients (Dayton 1940), only 5 per cent of the ever-married manic-depressives were divorced or separated. However, 0degaard, treating similar data from a rather different standpoint, found that the standardized admission rate for divorced manic-depressive men in Norway between the ages of 30 and 69 was 101 (as against 86 for the still-married patients) and for divorced manic-depressive women of that age group 166 against 117 for the still married). This he attributes not to the effect of divorce upon the patient's mental health but rather to the disturbing effect of the patient's personality and illness upon the maintenance of a harmonious marriage. (0degaard 1953)
Manic-depressive patients tend as a group to have physical and mental characteristics that are compatible with normal mental health but which are more often found among these patients than in the general population. Their "cycloid" temperament and their pyknic habit of body might well affect their choice of spouse, though in what way is a matter for conjecture: even if we subscribe to the "complementary needs" theory (Winch 1955), it is by no means clear what qualities in a mate would most gratify the needs of cyclothymic persons. However, a crude test of whether homogamy prevails can be applied by seeing whether those husbands and wives

(of manic-depressives) who themselves develop a psychotic illness show in that illness a manic-depressive picture. There are three collections of cases where both husband and wife became mentally ill-- Schulz's, Elsaesser's, and my own, (Schulz 1940, Elsaesser 1952, Lewis 1957) totaling in all 174 couples--but in none of the three series was there a significant difference, in the cases of the manic-depressive propositi, between the number of their spouses whose illness was schizophrenic and the number whose illness was manic-depressive. Assortative mating doubtless occurs, but I do not know of any satisfactory evidence on this. Nor do we know what effect community attitudes towards the different forms of mental disorder have in determining choice of partner, once illness has become manifest in an otherwise eligible man or woman. In some families the attitude is such that their members would not be willing to marry anyone who had had treatment in a mental hospital, whereas in other families the prejudice against a patient showing the aftermath of schizophrenia would be strong but there would be no objection to the apparently fully recovered manic-depressive. The "mating" habits of manic-depressives could be altered by changes in hospital policy regarding community care for psychotic patients and by changes in public attitudes because of health education, propaganda and myths: but here again we cannot say whether there has in fact been a change on this account.
Essen-Moller has demonstrated that, so far as fertility is concerned, changes in the reproductive behavior of the general population are closely reflected in the reproductive behavior of the manicdepressives. It may fairly be assumed that these patients will also be respon-

sive to changing social forces, which influence the probability of marriage. They are not likely to alarm us, however, so long as the marriage and fertility rates of manic-depressives approximate to those of the population in which the patients live. This situation may change rapidly. Introduction of an effective oral contraceptive; more precise knowledge of the genetic probabilities in this psychosis; general acceptance of the much promulgated view that every mental illness is "just an illness like any other"; a therapeutic advance that would nip most attacks of mania or depression in the bud before they disrupt the tenor of the patient's daily life--any of these probable events might make a lot of difference in the fertility of manic-depressives.
Though it is not strictly germane to our theme today, the apparent effect of marital state upon the course of manicdepressive illness deserves a brief reference. There are significant differences between the single and the married manic-depressives of both sexes in respect of duration of hospital stay. This was strikingly evident in Dr. Norris's large series (Norris 1959). Not only are single persons more likely to enter a mental hospital with this illness, but once there they are likely to remain longer. In other words, the single stay ill in hospital longer than the married. This, of course, touches again on the King Charles' Head of so many genetic and epidemiological studies of mental illness: how far can conclusions drawn from mental hospital patients with a specified disorder be taken to hold good for all persons with that disorder. No one will deny that many persons with manic-depressive illness have it in such a form and in such circumstances that they never enter a mental hospital, and may never even

consult a doctor for it. Many psychia-
trists would further maintain that there
is not a definite boundary, but rather a
continuous gradation, between manic-
depressive psychosis and psychogenic de-
pression or excitement. In the face of
these diagnostic quandaries, only a dog-
matist would be ready to laydown the
law at present about the mating and fer-
tility patterns in families with manic-
depressive psychosis.
