Significant increase in the incidence of blood group A has been found in gastric cancer. Clarke in Great Britain, and Buckwalter in the United States, studied secretor status in gastric cancer and did not find a relationship different from that in controls. We have chosen certain ethnic groups in the United States and Asia which are known to have different incidences of gastric cancer. We have found an increased frequency of the secretion of blood-group substances in patients with stomach cancer as compared to the controls. Saliva samples were obtained from those with gastric cancer and controls from Japan and the United States. The Japanese controls consisted of the spouse, siblings, and children of the patient. These were analyzed for blood-group substances by using a modification of McNeal's inhibi-

tion-agglutination technique. Secretornonsecretor status was determined by using the bimodal-curve technique, despite its limitations. The results were presented.
When the data were analyzed quantitatively with regard to each blood-group substance, A, B, and H, the results were as follows:
1) In the United States, gastric-cancer subjects secreted significantly more H substance (p=0.001) and A substance (p=0.05) than controls.
2) In Japan, the secretion of bloodgroup substances A and H was higher, but not significantly higher, in gastriccancer subjects than in the controls. Bsubstance - secretion findings were not significantly different from those in controls.
3) No significant differences were observed in secretion of blood-group substances as related to sex and age.
Preliminary studies have been made on other ethnic groups--e.g., Chinese and Filipinos.
