IN 1957, FESSAS AND PAPASPYROU de-
scribed a fast moving hemoglobin which, at pH 8.6, was faster than Hb A, but slower than Hb H, while at pH 6.5 it was separated from Hb A, but was more cathodic than Hb H. In 1958,Ager and Lehmann found, in an infant showing signs of thalassemia, a fast moving hemoglobin, which was called "Bart's" hemoglobin in the belief that it was different from that described by Fessas and Papaspyrou. However, Fessas (1959a) was later of the opinion that these twohemoglobins were probably identical.
Studies on abnormal hemoglobins of newborn infants have been carried out on a large scale in Singapore (Vella, 1959), in Djakarta Lie-Injo Luan Eng, 1959), in Greece (Fessas, 1959a) and in Thailand (Tuchinda et al., 1959). Studies on cord blood of Negro newborn babies were carried out in the United States by Minnich et al. (1959), Huisman andSebens (1960) and Weatherall (personal communication) and in Negroes in Africa by Hendrickse et al. (1960). Recently, a study of the hemoglobin of newborn babies in Malaya has been carried out (Lie-Injo Luan Eng and Ti, 1961) in all these studies a fast-moving hemoglobin was found in a proportion

of newborn infants (see Table 1). This hemoglobin disappeared after the first few months of life. The babies were found to be healthy.
What is the Significance of this FastMoving Hemoglobin? Although, during the surveys described above, it was found that the babies carrying this "Bart's" hemoglobin in the newborn period were healthy, this hemoglobin has also been encountered on rare occasions in disease states (Ager and Lehmann, 1958,Choremis etal., 1959,Ramot etal., 1959, Fessas, 1959b). Recently, two cases of chronic hemolytic anemia with hepatomegaly and splenomegaly associated with Hb H and Hb "Bart's" (Hb F & P) were found in two Chinese adult siblings.
The author has been puzzled why this hemoglobin was not found more often in disease conditions, when it is not rare in newborn infants. If the production of this hemoglobin were the result of the presence of a pathologic gene (and therefore able to lead to disease), in analogy to other hemoglobinopathies, it should be found more often. Assuming that the diseased patients die too early to be detected, the author has screened diseased and stillborn babies in Indonesia and Malaya in an attempt to correlate this fast-moving hemoglobin with disease and foetal death. A correlation was indeed found between the presence of a large

amount of this Hb "Bart's" (F & P) and a certain well-defined type of clinical picture.
Eight cases of severe hydrops and erythroblastosis foetalis with enlarged liver and spleen and pallor (four in Indonesia and four in Malaya) were found to have a large amount of Hb "Bart's" (Hb F & P) in the blood. (See Fig. 1.) In six of them, in addition to "Bart's" hemoglobin, a small amount of Hb H was also detected. They were all of Chinese origin, and were stillborn or died immediately after birth. The foetuses ranged in age from 28 to 36 weeks. The placenta was large, pale and friable. The liver was very much enlarged in all, while the spleen was enlarged in seven of them. There was severe erythroblastosis of the peripheral blood. Many target cells and thin cells were seen. Poikilocytosis and anisocytosis were present. It is of interest that the red blood cells in the foetuses showed the sickling phenomenon, although no Hb S was detected. Particulars about this sickling phenomenon have been reported elsewhere (Lie-Injo Luan Eng, 1961). Postmortem examination showed numerous extra-medullary erythropoietic foci in spleen, liver, placenta and other organs.

No antibodies were found in the infants.
The symptoms presented by all foetuses indicated an increased destruction of red blood cells with consequent hyperactivity of the erythropoietic system. Until now, the most important factor in the causation of hydrops and erythroblastosis has been thought to be isoimmunization of the mother against her foetal blood. In Western countries, the Rh factor was found to be the most important cause, while in Asian countries, the ABO blood incompatibilities were presumed to be responsible for the disease. However, no evidence of iso-immunization was found in our cases, while abnormal hemoglobin production Avas found in all of them.
As already mentioned, "Bart's" hemoglobin, in a low but appreciable amount, is also found in a proportion of healthy newborn infants. It is therefore tempting to postulate that the difference between the low concentration of the abnormal hemoglobin in the healthy newborn and the high concentration in diseased foetuses, and the absence or presence of clinical symptoms are based on the inheritance of one or two abnormal genes. Probably, in analogy to other hemoglobinopathies, the occurrence of

two abnormal genes leads to the diseased state, while the presence of one gene only is not sufficient to produce clinical symptoms, but finds its expression in a low concentration of the abnormal hemoglobin in the newborn infant. Although, in the parents, no abnormal hemoglobin could be detected, and the alkali denaturation of the hemoglobin was within normal limits, in most cases, both parents showed some hematological abnormalities. No increase of Hb A2 was found in the parents.
Chemical Basis of Inheritance. In the light of recent knowledge about the chemical structure of pathological hemoglobins, speculations have been put forward as regards the chemical basis of thalassemia and related conditions. It has been found that normal adult hemoglobin consists of two identical half molecules, each consisting of two polypetide chains, called the «- and the ßchains (Rhinesmith et al., 1957 and 1958). Normal adult hemoglobin A consists of two «· and two /?-chains and is called Hb a2/32. Foetal hemoglobin consists of two «-chains and two 7-chains and is called Hb «272 (Hunt, 1959, Hunt and Lehmann, 1959), while Hb A2 consists of two «chains and two 8 chains, is called Hb «282 (Müller and Jonxis, 1960). Hb H is made up solely of /8-chains of adult hemoglobin, and can therefore be called Hb /?.,. Hemoglobin "Bart's" is the counterpart in the foetal system, (Hunt and Lehmann, 1959) consists solely of y-chains and is therefore Hb y4. Ingram and Stretton postulated that the defect in thalassemia might involve either the «-or theßchains and introduced the terms «chain thalassemia and /J-chain thalassemia. He postulated that in «-chain thalassemia and /5-chain thalassemia, the defect is situated in, respectively, the «-chain or the y8-chain, without the production of elec-

trophoretic abnormalities, but with an impairment of the rate of production of the «-chains or /?-chains.
In «-chain thalassemia, impairment of the production of the «-chains in the formation of adult hemoglobin results in a surplus of /î-chains (/?-chains from adult hemoglobin). A surplus of these ^-chains leads to the formation of Hb ßi ( = H b H). Impairment of the production of «chains in the formation of foetal hemoglobin, results in a surplus of y-chains (y-chains of foetal hemoglobin). The surplus of these y-chains leads to the formation of Hb y4 or "Bart's" hemoglobin.
In ß-chain thalassemia, there is an impairment of the production of ßchains. Since foetal hemoglobin does not have j8-chains, this impairment has its effect only in the formation of adult hemoglobin. Impairment of the production of ^-chains then leads to a surplus of «-chains. These surplus «chains will be taken up by the formation of more Hb a2y2 (=foetal Hb F) and the formation of more 8-chains leading to a raised amount of Hb <*282 (Hb A2).
If so, our cases of hydrops and erythroblastosis foetalis would fit into the concept of «-chain thalassemia. In the normal foetus, usually a large amount of foetal hemoglobin and only a small amount of adult hemoglobin is formed. Severe impairment (which is to be expected in the homozygous state), of «chain production in this period would lead to the formation of a large amount of Hb y4 ( = H b "Bart's") and a small amount of Hb ßA ( = Hb H). This is exactly what we found in our hydropic foetuses. In several, no Hb H could be found, although an amount too small to be detected might have been present. It seems that, in the parents, who presumably have the trait, the suppression

52 Lie-Injo Luan Eng

is so slight that the surplus of ^-chains, leading to the formation of Hb H, could not be detected by the conventional methods used.
What is the Anthropological Significance of this "Bart's" or Fessas& Papaspyrou Hemoglobin} It is difficult to evaluate the anthropological significance at this stage of knowledge. As already mentioned it is tempting to postulate that the presence of an appreciable, but low, amount of this Hb "Bart's" in the newborn period represents the heterozygous or trait form of one or other pathologic gene, while the homozygous condition would lead to severe disease and mostly to death. That the mere presence of Hb "Bart's" (F & P) in the blood in the newborn period represents an abnormal gene seems unlikely since several workers (Huisman, Weatherall, personal communications), studying cord blood hemoglobin samples from Negro newborns by starch gel electrophoresis, found numerous samples to contain minute amounts of this hemoglobin, which on paper electrophoresis did not show this component. The incidence is so high that it seems unlikely that it involves an abnormal gene. However, a definite increase, with the component easily detected on paper electrophoresis is probably an inherited abnormality. This component has been noted in twins (Tuchinda et al., 1959, Lie-Injo and Lie Hong Gie, 1961) while a definite increase on paper electrophoresis has been found in two newborn babies on two successive births to the same mother (Lie-Injo & Poey-Oei, unpublished observations). It has further been found in definite disease conditions as mentioned above.
It is also not known whether, in the different races so far examined, an increase of this component in the newborn

period is the expression of an identical abnormal gene. It may be that the phenomenon of an increased Hb "Bart's" in the newborn period in Negroes and in Chinese, for instance, are not similar. They may have neither the same meaning, nor represent the same gene abnormality. However, the incidence of ± 5 % in the Thais and ± 4 % in Chinese may point to a link between these two groups. The majority of the Chinese in Malaya and Indonesia came from southern China. Since the Thais have a high incidence of Hb E, and Hb E is rare in Chinese, it is not probable that the Chinese have received the gene from the Thais, since this would have resulted in a higher incidence of Hb E in the Chinese. Probably, the Thais, as well as the southern Chinese, have received the gene from common ancestors from northern areas.
The higher incidence of Hb "Bart's" in Malays than in Indonesians may be caused by an admixture with Chinese or Thai blood greater in the Malays than in the Indonesians. It would be interesting to know the incidence in the northern areas of China, and in Burma.
