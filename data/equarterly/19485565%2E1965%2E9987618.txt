The nonwhite population of the United States has a substantially higher birth rate than the white population. In the period 1951-63, the crude birth rate of nonwhites varied between 30 and 34 per 1,000; the rate for whites was about 10 points lower, in the range of 21 to 24 per 1,000. The gap between these figures makes it clear that the family planning practices of the nonwhite population must differ considerably from those of the white population. Until recently, however, there was virtually no information available on the control of fertility among nonwhites.
The Growth of American Families Study for I9601 provides the first such information for a nationwide sample of nonwhite married couples in the childbearing period of life. Interviews were limited to 18- to 39-year-old wives, currently living with husband or with husband absent in the armed forces. The size of the sample was small--only 270, compared with 2,414 for similarly defined white wives. However, some of the differences between whites and nonwhites were so wide that even a small sample was large enough to reveal them. Table

Most of the nonwhite wives (256) were Negro. In addition, there were ten Japanese, one American Indian, one Chinese, one Eskimo, and one native of Guam.
The remainder of this article will present white-nonwhite comparisons on past, expected, and desired numbers of births; fecundity; the use of contraception; methods of contraception; and success in family planning.

how many children they would have altogether if they could have just the number they wanted and then stop, nonwhite wives gave replies that averaged 2.9 children, and white wives gave replies that averaged 3.3. Even with the limitations of small sample size and our imperfect measure of the number of children wanted, it is clear that the desired fertility goals of nonwhite married women are lower than those of white married women.
In spite of their wishes to the contrary, nonwhite wives have had and expect to have more births than white wives. The averages in Table 2 show that the past fertility of nonwhite wives exceeded that of white wives by 17% (2.7 births by 1960 vs. 2.3). The relative difference for total births expected was about the same (3.6 for nonwhite wives and 3.1 for white wives).
We have some reason for thinking that nonwhite wives will have even more births than they expect. As the above figures indicate, nonwhite wives expect

about the same average number of ad-

ditional births after 1960 as white wives.

Yet, as we shall see, they are less able to

control their fertility. As a result, it

seems likely that nonwhite wives will

have more additional births than they

expect. Perhaps their fertility will reach

their maximum expected average of 3.9

births per woman instead of their "most

likely" average of 3.6.

The data in Table 2 show that the

widest differences in fertility between

white and nonwhite couples are found

in the South, especially the rural South,

and among couples with little education.

Nonwhite couples living on farms in

the South have unusually high fertility.

There are only 33 wives in this group in

the average of 2.1 for white wives living on farms in the South.2 The nonwhite

able white wives, but expected over twice as many altogether (5.9 vs. 2.9).
As Negroes move from Southern rural areas to towns and cities, their fertility is greatly modified. Nonwhite couples with previous Southern farm residence (that is, either husband, wife, or both had lived on a Southern farm at some time) had an average of 2.6 births and expected 3.5 altogether (Table 2). These figures are well below the corresponding ones for couples still living on Southern farms; but they are still above those for nonwhites with no Southern farm background, which suggests that previous Southern farm residence has some influence on the fertility of nonwhite married couples.
Although few nonwhites remain on Southern farms, a large number have Southern rural background. In the present sample, nearly half (45%) of the nonwhite wives reported that they or their husbands had lived on a Southern farm at some time in their lives. Hence, the influence of Southern rural ways of life is still widespread in the nonwhite population.
When we come to nonwhite couples with no previous Southern farm residence, we find average past and expected numbers of births that do not differ significantly from those of white couples. In other words, by the time nonwhite couples are one generation or more removed from the rural South, their fertility is very much like that of the white population (see Table 2).
In 1960, only 43% of the nonwhite wives reported no Southern farm background for themselves or their husbands. This proportion will rise greatly in another generation, and the influence of Southern rural patterns of fertility behavior will inevitably diminish.

Educational attainment is also closely related to white-nonwhite fertility differences. The excess of nonwhite over white fertility is greatest among the leasteducated wives. Among wives with only a grade school education, nonwhite have had and expect about 25% more births than whites (Table 2). At the upper end of the educational continuum, however, nonwhite wives with a college education have had and expect fewer births than white wives in the same educational category. Data from the 1960 Census on children ever borne to ever-married women present essentially the same picture.
What we see in these differentials is the gradual adoption of attitudes and practices favoring small families as Negroes move from farms to cities and as their educational attainment rises. The culmination of this process is a welleducated Negro upper class with relatively few children.3 If we combine relatively well-educated couples (the wife has finished high school or has had some college education) and those with less education who have never lived on a Southern farm, we find that nonwhite married couples have nearly the same past and expected fertility as white married couples. Nonwhite wives in this group expect an average of 3.0 births, as compared with 3.1 for white wives. The average numbers of births by 1960 are 2.2 and 2.3 for the nonwhite and white wives, respectively. Inasmuch as this broad group contains 63% of the nonwhite sample, we may say that a majority of nonwhite married couples have and expect about the same number of children as white couples in similarly defined socioeconomic groups.
3 For a discussion of the low-fertility patterns of upper-class nonwhites, see E. Franklin Frazier, The Negro in the United States, Macmillan Company, New York, 1949, pp. 331-332.

The most important facts brought out here are (1) that nonwhite wives do not want more children than white wives, and probably want fewer; (2) that the fertility of a majority of nonwhite wives does not differ widely from that of white wives in similarly defined groups; and (3) that the differences that exist for the remainder of the nonwhite married couples are closely associated with characteristics that will have less influence in the future than they do now--previous and current Southern farm residence and low educational attainment. These findings give us reason to believe that fertility differences between whites and nonwhites will become narrower.4
FECUNDITY
There is reason to believe that in the recent past impairments of the reproductive system were more common among nonwhites than whites. One item of evidence is the high proportion of older nonwhite women who are childless. The 1960 Census shows that among ever-married women 50 to 54 years old, for example, the proportion who never had any children was 28% for nonwhites and 20% for whites. It seems likely that most of the childlessness among nonwhites was involuntary (due to physiological impairments), while most of that among whites was due to the voluntary prevention of pregnancy.5
The 1960 Census also shows that the percentage of ever-married women who
4 Fertility differences from the 1950 Census have also been cited as evidence that nonwhite fertility will probably decline in the future. See Ann and Everett Lee, "The Future Fertility of the American Negro," Social Forces, 37 (3): 228231, March 1959.
5 For evidence on the extent of involuntary childlessness among nonwhites, see Clyde V. Kiser, "Fertility Trends and Differentials among Nonwhites in the United States," Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly, 36(2): 149-197. See especially pp. 190-196.

are childless has declined to 14% for nonwhite women 25 to 29 years old. This compares with 12% for white women in this age group. In other words, if we use the prevalence of childlessness as a rough indicator of the presence of fecundity impairments, it appears that young nonwhite wives are more fecund than nonwhite wives a generation earlier, and are now about as fecund as young white wives.
Data from the present study show no substantial white-nonwhite differences in the prevalence of fecundity impairments. The proportions Subfecund6 are 33% for nonwhites and 31% for whites.
Although the overall proportions with impaired fecundity are about the same for whites and nonwhites, there do appear to be some minor differences in the kinds of impairments. A higher proportion of white wives reported that they or their husbands had undergone an operation for the purpose of preventing conception. The proportion reporting such an operation was 6% for white wives and only 3% for nonwhite wives.
However, nonwhites do not seem to differ from whites in the proportion of wives reporting operations that prevent pregnancy but that were performed to correct a pathological condition. The proportion reporting such operations was the same for both groups, 4%.
THE USE OF CONTRACEPTION
The use of contraception is less common among nonwhite than among white married couples. By the time of interview, 59% of the nonwhite couples

had used contraception, as compared with 81% of the white couples. The percentages who had used or expected to use contraception were somewhat closer: 76% for nonwhites and 87% for whites. The differences are statistically significant.
The use of contraception among nonwhites is closely related to Southern farm residence. Only 36% of the nonwhite wives living on Southern farms reported that they or their husbands had tried to limit family size (Table 3). This is the lowest proportion of Users7 found for any socioeconomic group in this study. Another 15% of the Southern farm residents expected to use contraception, so that slightly over half of them (52%, after rounding) had used contraception or expected to do so. Of the 48% who expected never to use contraception, 27% were Subfecund. Most of them would not have to use contraception to prevent

additional pregnancies. The remaining 21% were Fecund and said they thought they would never use contraception.
Nonwhite couples who have lived on a Southern farm, but no longer do so, are much more likely to use contraception. Apparently the move from rural to urban areas does much to change attitudes toward family size and the use of methods to prevent pregnancy. Another possibility is that migration is a selective process--i.e., that the men and women who leave the farms are already more ambitious and more likely to want to plan their families than those who stay. Also, we must remember that some of the husbands and wives with Southern rural backgrounds left these areas when they were children and have grown up among people who knew about and used contraception.
Whatever the explanation, we find that 60% of the nonwhite couples with previous Southern farm background have used contraception (Table 3). The proportion who have used or expected to use

contraception is 80%, which is not very far from the 87% for whites.
Couples without previous Southern farm residence differ little from those who come from Southern rural backgrounds. Slightly more of them have used contraception (65% instead of 60%), but slightly fewer have used or expect to use (78% instead of 80%). None of these differences is statistically significant.
Nonwhite wives with a college education report a high prevalence of use. Altogether, 95% of them have used or expect to use contraception, as compared with 93% for college-educated whites (Table 2).
Again, it appears that better-educated nonwhite couples readily adopt moderate family-size goals and methods of attaining them. This suggests that continued improvements in the education of nonwhites will bring an increase in the proportion using contraception.

METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
After nonwhite couples begin to use contraception, they tend to use less effective methods than whites. This is shown by the comparisons in Table 4.

· The total exceeds 100 because many couples used two or more methods.

One of the most important differences shown here is the greater reliance of nonwhite couples on douche, a method that is relatively low in effectiveness. Half of the nonwhite Users have used this method, as compared with only about a quarter of white Users. Among nonwhite couples, it is the second most common method, while among whites it ranks fourth.
Condom is the most popular method among nonwhites, as it is among whites. In fact, the proportion using this highly effective method may be somewhat greater for nonwhites than for whites, but we cannot be sure because the whitenonwhite differences are not quite large enough to be significant.
The proportions of Users using diaphragm and rhythm are both lower for nonwhites than for whites.
It is important to note that nonwhite couples show higher proportions trying to control fertility with the most readily available "female" methods: douche, jelly, and vaginal suppositories. Unlike diaphragm, these three methods may be obtained without a doctor's prescription, and, like diaphragm, they are applied by the wife. In other words, it appears that in many nonwhite families, the wife feels that she must take the chief responsibility for contraception; and she tries to do this without medical advice, which is generally less available to nonwhites than to white wives.
Another interesting feature of the comparisons shown in Table 4 is the fact that nonwhites show an average of 215 reports of methods per 100 couples, compared with 186 per 100 for whites. This means that the nonwhite Users tend to use more methods than white Users, probably in an effort to find methods that give them satisfactory protection.

FERTILITY PLANNING STATUS
Nonwhite couples have been much less successful than whites in planning fertility. Only 7% of the nonwhite couples have Completely Planned fertility, compared with 21% for whites (Table 5)8. But the most important contrast is in the proportion with Excess Fertility: 31% for nonwhites and 17% for whites.
The proportions in the intermediate planning groups (Partly Planned and Partly Unplanned) are nearly the same
8 The planning status groups are defined as follows:
Completely Planned: Users with no pregnancies and other Users who stopped using contraception in order to conceive before every pregnancy.
Partly Planned: Couples who had one or more conceptions before starting to use contraception because they wanted these conceptions as soon as possible. Any conception after use began occurred when contraception was stopped in order to conceive.
Partly Unplanned: Couples who have had one or more "unplanned" pregnancies, but have not had more pregnancies than wanted.
Excess Fertility: Either the husband or the wife or both did not want another child at the time of the last conception.

for whites and nonwhites. We may say, then, that the two color groups differ chiefly with respect to the proportions in the two extreme planning groups-- Completely Planned and Excess Fertility --and we shall focus attention mainly on the proportions in these groups.
As might be expected from previously described differentials, the white-nonwhite differences in planning status are greatest among couples on farms in the South. Among nonwhites living on Southern farms, nearly half (48%) have had more pregnancies than the husband or wife wanted (Table 5). This is the highest prevalence of Excess Fertility found for any socioeconomic group in this study. It compares with 20% for white couples on Southern farms. The only white group with a level of Excess Fertility anywhere near this consists of those with a poor education (the wife did not go beyond grade school) and a low income (the husband made less than $4,000 a year); such couples had 39% with Excess Fertility.

Among nonwhite couples, former residents of the rural South are more successful family planners than those who remain, but they are still not so successful as whites. A few of them have Completely Planned fertility (about 8%), but this is well below the proportions of 22% for the white population.
Also, the prevalence of Excess Fertility is lower among nonwhites no longer living on Southern farms (29% instead of 48%), but this is still well above the 18% for whites.
Obviously, the move from the Southern farm to other areas has brought with it a substantial improvement in the success with which nonwhite couples plan their families. But they have still not achieved the levels observed for the white population.
The extent to which nonwhites differ from whites in their family planning practices can also be seen when we compare the different education groups (Table 5). In every educational category, including the college group, nonwhite couples have shown less success in family planning than white couples. Their level of Completely Planned fertility is lower, and their level of Excess Fertility is higher.
Apparently, planning status is one fertility variable in which nonwhites differ consistently from whites, regardless of socioeconomic status. The white-nonwhite differentials vary in magnitude, but they are in the same direction in all education groups and all regions of the country (Table 5).

SUMMARY
The rapid cultural change that the nonwhite population is undergoing has left its mark on fertility differences between whites and nonwhites. We find that nonwhite couples have had and expect more births than white couples, and that this difference is brought about partly by the unusually high fertility of a minority of nonwhite couples who live in the rural South, and partly by the moderately high fertility of the many nonwhite couples who have Southern farm origins. Nonwhite couples with no Southern farm background have and expect about the same number of births as similar white couples. These differentials suggest that as the influence of Southern rural patterns of mating and childbearing diminishes, the fertility differences between whites and nonwhites will decline.
It is clear that nonwhite wives do not want as many children as they expect to have. They want about the same number as white wives or fewer.
Although there is some evidence that in the past there was a greater prevalence of fecundity impairments in the nonwhite population, the present study gives us no reason to believe that this is still true.
A lower proportion of nonwhites than of whites have used contraception, and a lower proportion expect to have done so by the end of the childbearing period.
Nonwhite couples are considerably less successful in controlling fertility than white couples. This seems to be true in all socioeconomic groups.
