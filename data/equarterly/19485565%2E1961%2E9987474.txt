OOME results of the latest census in the world's third most populous country have now been published. Though incomplete, their analysis is of great interest, and the implications often highly revealing.
The census of the USSR was taken on 15 January 1959, and the first results of the census were announced on 10 May 1959, reporting the total, urban, and rural population, by administrative subdivisions of the country, as well as the population of cities with 50,000 or more inhabitants and selected smaller urban places of administrative significance. The second results were released on 4 February 1960, cast in such a form as to publicize the educational attainment of the population, the distribution of population by ethnic-national groups, and the age-sex composition. A third summary of census results, released in December

1960, deals essentially, and not too intelligibly, with labor force and occupations.
Meanwhile, summaries of a few local census results--comparable more or less to the data reported for the country as a whole--have appeared in republican newspapers, and various kinds of fragmentary information have been announced in a multiplicity of Soviet sources. It is planned to publish the results of the 1959 census in some detail, but what exactly will be released, and when, is unknown.
The 1959 census was patterned on the (last) census of 1939. There were minor changes in the ordering and wording of the fifteen questions, but these need not concern us here.1 Judging by the general
1 Fifteen questions were asked in the 1959 census: (1) relationship to the head of the family; (2) permanently resident; (3) temporarily resident; (4) sex; (5) age; (6) married at present or not; (7) nationality; (8) native tongue; (9) citizenship; (10) educational attainment; (11) name of educational institution, if currently enrolled; (12) place of work; (13) occupation; (14) means of livelihood if without occupation;

criteria, it seems likely that the 1959 census may have been a more full and comprehensive accounting. For example, more time and care was devoted to its planning. The political environment was also different: in 1939 the popula: tion census followed political purges and the suppression -- on questionable grounds --of the 1937 census; in 1959 internal affairs were much more settled.
The Soviet censuses of both 1939 and 1959 stand out in striking contrast to those of other countries in certain respects. For example, in the Soviet census of 1939 about one-third more time per capita was spent on field work than in the United States census of 1940;2 this intensive emphasis on field work in Soviet censuses is undoubtedly due to the special procedures not normally found in censuses of other countries. For example, there is the three-visitation procedure: first, the enumerator assesses in a general way the district he is to cover, including a preliminary tabulation of the number of inhabitants and the scheduling of appointments with persons who may be hard to reach on the date of the actual census; second, the full-scale enumeration occurs; and, third, a kind of post-enumeration is carried out by a group of officials, including a prominent official of the local urban or rural authority. Theoretically, at least, the postenumeration check is supposed to cover 100 per cent of the enumerated population; in fact it is highly unlikely to be so complete. However, if a spot-check of the enumerator's work reveals errors, the
and (15) social group (workers; employee; collective farmer; handicraftsman, member of cooperative; individual farmer; handicraftsman, not member of co-operative; individuals in liberal professions; clergy).

particular enumerator's work would be thoroughly reviewed, and any pattern of intentional mistakes would certainly be viewed as a serious offense.
Another interesting characteristic of recent Soviet censuses is the requirement that the information be obtained from the individual himself, rather than second-hand, and--other things being equal --this should make for a more accurate count. Exceptions to this rule are said to be limited to persons who are unavailable, clearly incompetent, or unable to respond to the census questions, such as absentees, small children, and sick persons.
Many aspects of the first announcement of Soviet census results have been analyzed in detail in various Western sources, and therefore only supplementary remarks seem in order here.3 First, there is still some confusion concerning the prewar size of the Soviet population. In the first postwar Soviet statistical handbook it was claimed that the prewar figure of 191,700,000 referred to 1940; the incorrectness of this attribution was discovered in the West, and in the latest census reports the earlier figure is correctly attributed to 1939. However, it has now been revised downward, to 190,700,000, without explanation, although the difference can probably be traced to revised estimates of the size of the population in territories annexed by the USSR.
Second, too little attention has been
3 An early analysis of Soviet census returns was prepared by Warren W. Eason ("The Soviet Population Today," Foreign Affairs, July 1959). An impressively well-rounded study has been made by John F. Kantner of the Population Council ("The Population of the Soviet Union,' Comparisons of the United States and Soviet Economies, U.S. Congress, Joint Economic Committee, Part I, 1959, pp. 31-71.)

given to the fact, evident since 1957, that --while Western analysts in 1950 accepted the Soviet statement that the USSR's population was about 200,000,000--the Soviet authorities had direct data showing the population to be only about 180,000,000 in 1950.
Third, it is also significant that the official Soviet estimate for April 1956 of 200,200,000 inhabitants is quite compatible with the results of the January 1959 census. It is a credit to Soviet statisticians that, despite the chaos created by the second world war and its aftermath, they were able on the basis of current statistics to come up with such an accurate estimate of the total population in 1956, 17 years after their last census. In recent Soviet statistical handbooks all yearly figures showing the natural increase of population (i.e., excess of births over deaths) have been revised backward to 1950, presumably taking the 1959 census result as a starting point. These revisions imply an error in the 1956 official estimate of only 1,000,000, if allowance is made for emigration from the USSR in 1956-59.
The 1959 census revealed a population of 208,827,000, a figure far below earlier Western expectations and one which reflects very heavy war-produced population losses running to several tens of millions. The census also indicates that the USSR had in 1959 about 100,000,000 persons in places classified as urban or urban-type settlements. Comparisons of the 1959 census data with the 1956 data from Soviet current statistics has generated some skepticism concerning the accuracy of the estimated urban population in 1956 of 87,000,000; i.e., the 195659 rate of growth is thought to be too large. The data available at present--in particular, the statistics on non-agricultural employment which, in the Soviet

Union, shows a high degree of correla-
tion with urban population changes--
would rather indicate that the estimate
of urban population for 1956, like the
estimate of the total population for the same year, was probably highly accurate.4
The period 1939 to 1959 witnessed a
net growth of urban population of 39,-
400,000, while the rural population sus-
tained a net loss of 21,000,000. In newly
released estimates by Soviet statisticians,
8,000,000 of the urban growth is attrib-
uted to natural increase of the urban
population, 7,000,000 to the reclassification of former rural places,5 and 24-
25,000,000 to net rural-to-urban migra-
tion. The implied natural increase of the
rural population is 10-11,000,000, but, of
course, the loss of 31-32,000,000 to ur-
ban communities more than wiped out
this natural increase (as was true,
though on a lesser scale, in the period
1926-39).
The redistribution of the Soviet pop-
ulation in the intercensal period has
been subjected to careful scrutiny in Western sources.6 Gross population
4The accuracy of the 1956 urban population count has also been defended, indirectly, by Demitri Shimkin, "Demographic Changes and SocioEconomic Forces within the Soviet Union, 19391959," Milbank Memorial Fund, 1960.
5 Lorimer (The Population of the Soviet Union, 1946, pp. 147 and 149) apparently interpreted this concept erroneously in analyzing changes between 1926 and 1939. It can be demonstrated that in dividing up the components of urban and rural population change a residual method was used by Soviet statisticians which implies that the population of "reclassified" places must refer to the date of their reclassification, i.e., their subsequent natural increase and migratory gain or loss is included under the independent categories of "natural increase" and "migration," and not as Lorimer assumed.

shifts during and since the war were massive and involved many millions of peoples; in this sense, the net redistribution among regions appears relatively small. However, when one considers the urban and rural populations of different regions separately, it becomes clear that substantial net redistribution has occurred--shifts away from the north, west, and southern regions and towards the Urals and the east. Most important, such comparisons make clear that differential rates of industrialization and urbanization have in the last two decades, as during the 1930's, been major determinants of the direction and intensity of population redistribution in the Soviet Union.
EDUCATIONAL DATA
The data on educational attainment are impressive in terms of what the regime has been able to achieve in the way of expanding educational training and facilities as compared with 1939. Other comparisons, however, reveal a quite different picture. For example, per capita levels of educational attainment in the Soviet Union do not approach 1959 rates in the United States, no matter at what level the comparison is made,7 and--Soviet propaganda notwithstanding -- this holds true still more for women than for men, with a single exception.
It is also revealing that in 1959 there were 3,778,000 persons with completed higher education, 1,933,000 men and 1,845,000 women--but for a different reason. When these data are compared with statistics in Soviet handbooks showing employment in the civilian economy, two significant implications emerge.
7This refers to the levels of educational attainment. However, both in terms of annual graduations and of the total stock of such persons, the USSR is well ahead of the United States with regard to engineers and doctors.

First, the proportion of women with higher degrees who are not employed in civilian economy is quite low (reflecting the labor-force squeeze)--only about 12 per cent as compared with about onethird before the war, in 1937. Second, on the assumption that the proportion of males not employed at all (i.e., retired, etc.) would hardly be less than an arbitrary one-half of the female rate (this assumption can be partly supported on the basis of other reasoning), it appears that approximately 350,000 male college graduates are not employed in the civilian economy.8 This group consists almost entirely of specialists attached directly to, or associated with, Soviet military activities, ranging from high-powered research on rockets and missiles to teaching in military academies.
Another striking thing about the Soviet educational figures is the increased role of women in education since 1939. Below the level of completed higher education there is now a substantial predominance of females, and even at the level of completed higher education the ratio of men to women is roughly equal. But significant urban-rural and regional differences still prevail in educational opportunities as a result of the unequal geographical distribution of institutions and restrictive quotas on certain ethnic groups; in many areas, such as Central Asia, local customs which inhibit school attendance still operate to some extent.
8Soviet sources report minor deficiencies in the annual registration of college graduates employed in the civilian economy which should not be exaggerated (few countries have such a fine recordkeeping system on this segment of the labor force). The estimate of 350,000 male college graduates not employed in the civilian economy attempts to allow for 50,000 male college graduates incorrectly reported in the employment data as well as for transitional unemployment (a month's vacation is permitted between graduation and reporting for work), and for post-graduate study by a very small number of college graduates.

ETHNIC DATA
In the 1926 Soviet census ethnic group was defined as narodnost, or ethnic group in terms of origin; in 1939 a more subjective criterion was substituted, the concept of natsionalnost, and the individual was asked, "To what ethnic group do you consider yourself to belong?" While the USSR's total population increased by only 16 per cent 1926-39, the Russian population grew by 27 per cent, and this disparity reflects in great part the shifting of ethnic identity in favor of the Russians. Many analysts expected a significant shift in the period 1939-59 as a result of assimilation of non-Russians into the Russian group, although on a lower scale than 1926-39, since it was known in advance of the 1959 census that the same concept would be employed as in 1939. The present author, for one, was surprised that the group who considered themselves Russians did not increase more than the census actually shows;9 be that as it may, there is a relative comparability of concepts between the 1939 and 1959 censuses, whereas this was not true between (a) the 1897 and 1926 censuses, or (b) the 1926 and 1939 censuses.
In terms of intercensal changes in ethnic identification, it is difficult to make numerical comparisons between 1939 and 1959, despite the comparability of concepts. Ethnic information for the old territory was never fully reported, although the unreported groups were a relatively insignificant proportion of the total population of the old territory.
9An event, perhaps unprecedented in the history of Russian demography, has just occurred. Revised census data indicate a decrease in the number of Russians counted in the 1959 census by 400,000, although the total population remains constant. The decrease in the Russians is made up by an exactly comparable increase of Ukrainians, Belorussians. and Kazakhs. Presumably, this is a reclassification of persons of mixed ethnic strains.

Much more serious is the fact that--as acknowledged by Soviet officials--the data on ethnic composition in the territories annexed by the USSR in the period 1939-46 are in part unreliable. Among the groups for which it is difficult to get reliable prewar information are the Jews, Germans, and Poles in the annexed areas (not to mention the Germans and Poles from outside the annexed areas who were deported to the USSR and survived to 1959); and, as a reciprocal aspect of this problem, the number of Russians, Ukrainians, and Belorussians in the annexed areas. From the point of view of the population in the annexed territories, these data deficiencies are serious; but from the point of view of the overall ethnic composition of the Soviet population they are not important, since the population of the annexed territories constitutes but a fraction of the total USSR population.
The over-all ethnic structure of Soviet population has not changed appreciably in the last intercensal period. Russians still constitute somewhat more than half the total population of the country (increasing from 53 to 55 per cent), and, together with Ukrainians and Belorussians, the three leading Slavic groups form a preponderant proportion--76 per cent--of the total. Jews were unique in suffering losses approaching total extermination in the occupied regions of the USSR; but Estonians, Belorussians, and Ukrainians also experienced severe losses. On the other hand, one should notice the tremendous population explosion among the peoples inhabiting Kazakhstan, Central Asia (Uzbek, Turkmen, Kirgiz, Tajik, and Karakalpak), and the Transcaucasus (Azerbaijani, Armenians, and Georgians). These relative gains are due in part to the high postwar natural increase (excess of births

128 Roof

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:26 08 December 2015

over deaths), and in part, apparently, to less deep involvement in the war. The application of basic sanitary practices, and somewhat easier access to modern medicine and medical facilities, have brought the crude death rates in Soviet Central Asia down to an all-time low, while the birth rates remain extremely high. This is the "population explosion" in its classic sense.
The second and related way of viewing the ethnic data is to consider the ethnic composition of the population in different geographic regions of the Soviet Union. Here, in addition to the uncertainty which surrounds certain portions of the acquired territories, primarily in the west, we have to rely on scattered and inadequate statistics for the various territorial subdivisions within the pre-1939 boundaries of the USSR. But, again, the problem is not insoluble, for the data have been ingeniously pieced together (though not yet published) by Allen Hetmanek. On the other hand, for 1959 more information of this kind has already been published than was ever made available from the 1939 census.
In terms of the ethnic composition of different territorial subdivisions, there are a number o£ interesting trends. The basic trend is towards the dispersal of ethnic groups spatially and the breakdown of formerly compact ethnic settlement areas. For example, the proportion of Ukrainians in the USSR who live outside the territorial limits of the Ukrainian Republic is far greater today than in 1939; the same thing holds true for other leading groups, including, notably, the Russians (in Kazakhstan, Russians now outnumber the native Kazakhs by 1,300,000) and Belorussians. This trend tends to become more marked in combination with industrialization, improved transportation facilities, etc. It is, however,

often thwarted, or even reversed, where there are forcible displacements of peoples or interruptions of the normal processes of industrialization.
Leading exceptions to the trend towards dispersal are the Latvians and Estonians, who have tended to become concentrated in the Baltic area. This is largely the product o£ a return movement of Russianized Baits as an aspect of Soviet policy to maintain control of this strategic area; it may also in part reflect the continued desire of these peoples to emphasize the distinctness of their ethnic identity.
Ethnic data on the Armenians must be considered separately, for in the intercensal period there was an influx of some 100,000 Armenians into the USSR from France, England, the United States, and other countries. The position of the Armenians in the USSR is also unusual in that only about half of the Armenians in the country are located within the territorial limits of the Republic bearing their name; other major concentrations of Armenians are in the neighboring Transcaucasian republics of Georgia and Azerbaijan.
The situation of the Jews is still more atypical. In the pre-revolutionary period the Jews were concentrated in the "pale of settlement" in the westernmost regions of the former Russian Empire. The censuses of 1926 and 1939 revealed the breakdown of this settlement area and important migratory flows into central Russia. This movement became a torrent in the face of Hitler's armies, and today there are important colonies of Soviet Jews throughout Asia, despite the continued failure of the experiment to make Birobijan, in the Soviet Far East, a major settlement area for the Soviet Jews. Thus, unlike other leading ethnic

Soviet Population

groups in the USSR, Soviet Jews are widely dispersed among different geographical regions.
AGE-SEX DATA
The age-sex composition of the population at the time of the 1959 census is reported in the second census announcement. Neither in connection with the 1939 census reports, nor in the new census summaries, is there direct information on the cross-tabulation of population by age and by sex in 1939, although the new census releases contain an estimated distribution of the 1939 population by age and the estimated total number (i.e., not by specific age groups) of men and women. Fortunately, by use of indirect means, Western students have pieced together an age-by-sex distribution of the 1939 population which is probably only slightly inferior to the information which the Soviet government possesses and, for reasons inexplicable, continues to suppress. This information is critical for studying many aspects of the intercensal trends in Soviet population.
Let us compare the "expected" population in 1949 (derived by projecting the 1939 age-sex composition forward ten years) with the "actual" population in 1949 (derived by projecting the 1959 agesex composition backward ten years). In this way an idea can be formed of the scope and characteristics of excess population losses during and immediately following the second world war. The details of these computations will not be presented here, but the general conclusions are pertinent to the present discussion. The population alive before the war (ie., in 1939) seems to have suEered excess population losses from all causes (emigration, direct military and civilian casualties, losses from hardships associ-

ated directly or only indirectly, if at all, with the war, as in the case of deaths in Soviet forced labor camps) of roughly 25,000,000, consisting of 20,000,000 men and 5,000,000 women. The population ages 0-9 (born after 1939), furthermore, was in 1949 some 13-15,000,000 lower than could be reasonably expected in the absence of the war and attendant calamities. Thus, excess losses amount to the staggering total of (very) approximately 40,000,000.
These results differ from earlier, precensal expectations in three important respects: (1) The total of excess losses is roughly 50 per cent higher than generally anticipated. (2) The degree by which male losses ages 10 and above in 1949, considered as a whole, exceed the losses of females is far greater than anticipated (in fact, the discrepancy in male losses is nearly sufficient to account for the total discrepancy in losses). (3) The fact that male losses were spread fairly evenly over each five-year age group, ages 20-49, in 1945 is surprising; it had been assumed that male losses would be heavily concentrated on the center of the "prime" (ages 20-39) military ages in 1945.
If we were to draw a 'hypothetical' population pyramid, as it is called, on graph paper, with millions plotted on the horizontal axis and with the ages of the population by five-year groups plotted on the vertical axis, an almost perfectly symmetrical triangle would be outlined. The number of males, shown on the left half of the diagram, would nearly equal the females, shown on the right; and the successive gradations of the population by age would form a straight line from the lowest to the highest ages. The Soviet population in 1939 merely approached the symmetry of this triangle, for it bore the visible imprint of

birth deficits and/or excess mortality associated with the first world war, the Civil War, famine, and collectivization. In 1959, however, the population pyramid is still more grossly distorted; there are not only serious irregularities from age to age, but the upper portion of the pyramid is markedly skewed to the right, reflecting a predominance of women over men of 20,000,000 in ages above 30. (See Fig. 1.)
Among the most marked irregularities in the gradation of Soviet population by age in 1959 is the deficit of boys and girls ages 10-14 and 15-19. These deficits, of course, are the product of the great de-

cline in fertility and of excess infant and child mortality during and immediately following the war. In recent years, and in the immediate future, these irregularities have influenced and will continue to influence the annual number of entrants into the Soviet labor force, the prime military ages, the child-bearing ages, and the total size of the workingage population.
The legal age for entering the labor force in the USSR is sixteen (although certain exceptions are permissible, especially in rural areas). The new data indicate that the average annual number of youths reaching sixteen in the period

1951-55 was 4,100,000; these were born during the peak fertility years of 193438. In the period 1956-59 (survivors of 193942 births) the figure declined by 10 per cent; during the one year 1960, the 16-year-olds numbered only ca. 1,700,000, or less than the 1951-55 average by nearly 60 per cent. Additional single year-ofage information is not available, but, according to the census groupings, the average annual number reaching 16 in the period 1961-64 will be 3,100,000-- considerably above the level of 1960, but still far below the 1951-55 level. Probably not until 1966 will the average annual number of entrants into the labor force exceed the average of 1951-55.
The economic significance of these irregularities in the population structure has already caused major modifications in Soviet manpower policies; in particular, efforts have been made to spread their effects as much as possible by manipulating educational policies in such a way as to minimize full-time educational opportunities and to maximize labor-force participation.
These comparisons were derived from an examination of the reported age composition of the 1959 population. Other comparisons can be drawn with little loss of accuracy by projecting the 1959 data on different segments of the population backward to 1950 (by adding mortality 1950-58), and forward to 1975 (by subtracting mortality 1958-75).10
The male population aged 20-34 is often regarded as the backbone of a country's military manpower capability. Whether we consider the population ages 20-24, 20-29, or 20-34, the new data indicate that the USSR's peak of military capability in the postwar period, purely

from the point of view of human effectives, was reached in 1960-61, when-- significantly enough--major reductions of the armed forces were announced. In part these reductions were certainly due to the changed nature of modern warfare, large armies being more expensive and less necessary than they used to be; but the timing of these cuts was also part of the general effort to free manpower for the civilian economy.
In the future the male population aged 20-34 will decline continuously, reaching a level of 11 per cent below the 1961 peak by approximately 1968. Thereafter a modest increase can be expected, but the 1961 peak will not be reached even by 1975.
The principal ages of parenthood, again, are 20 to 34. Since the number of men and women in these age groups is approximately equal, the trends indicated for prime military ages also apply to the main child-bearing ages. Other things being equal, the population structure will lead to declines in fertility. It is not generally recognized that the fertility of Soviet women--when measured as the ratio of women in the child-bearing ages to the reported number of births --is at present about one-third lower than the fertility of women in the United States; most people still retain the outmoded picture of the Russian peasant as having a large family. Even specialists who are aware of the fact that Soviet women's fertility is lower than in the United States, frequently attribute this to the imbalance of the sexes caused by the USSR's incomparably greater losses of males in the war (United States losses totalled 300,000 men; Soviet military losses probably numbered 7-10,000,000). However, the facts do not support this point of view. When measured as the ratio of men in the relevant ages to the

132 Roof

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:26 08 December 2015

reported number of births, the fertility of Soviet men is one-quarter lower than the fertility of US males.
Given the catastrophic decline in the average size of the contingent entering the working ages (in the USSR, working ages consist of males aged 16-59 and females aged 16-54) in the late fifties and early sixties, it was earlier expected by Western analysts that there would be a substantial decline in the working-age population in 1961-62. This is not so. In April this year additional (fragmentary) data became available which suggest that the post-war peak in the working-age population may have been reached around 1958, that there was only a modest decline (half a million or so) 1958-60, and that the trend was reversed by 1961.
The differences in the computed size of the working-age population during 1958-61 are too small to be regarded as having statistical validity. They are undoubtedly correct, however, with regard to the general trend: surprisingly enough, the decline in the working-age population seems to be a thing of the past rather than of the future. By chance, during the years when the entering contingents were at such a low ebb, the deficit of youths was compensated by relatively large increases in the adult population of working age.
While the decrease was not substantial, we observe a truly remarkable reduction in the rate of growth. In 1951-55 the working-age population increased by 10 per cent; in 1956-60, by only 1.5 per cent. This situation would have had still more ominous implications for the Soviet economy were it not for the sex composition of the observed (slight) increase of 1,800,000 in the working ages during 1956-60. While females of working ages declined by 700,000, of more direct con-

sequence for the labor force was an in-
crease of males by 2,500,000.
In the period of the current seven-year
plan, that is 1959-65, the data from the
census indicate a net increase in the work-
ing-age population of only 4,300,000, or
only one-third of the increment of 13,-
400,000 in the preceding seven years.
There is abundant evidence that the So-
viet government is aware of the serious-
ness of this striking reduction in rate of
growth, for in recent years drastic meas-
ures have been taken to enlarge the pro-
portion of the working-age population
who are actually employed, to drain off
pockets of unemployment (especially in
western cities), to draw on marginal
groups (youths, old people and women),
and to reallocate manpower from less to
more essential segments of the economy.11
The number of youths permitted to
study full time in higher educational in-
stitutions, for example, has been altered downward,12 and meanwhile there is evi-
dence of the inclusion in the worker-
employee category of students who work
a few days a week under the new school
reform of 1958. Military forces were re-
ported to have been reduced in 1960-61
by 1,200,000.

Using these age groups as an index, the net increase in the able-bodied population in the seven-year period 1952-58 was 11,600,000 and in the seven-year period 1959-65 8,500,000. This illustrates the possibilities open to the Soviet government for pulling marginal groups into the labor force when needed.
12 In recent years the trend in full-time enrollment in higher educational institutions has been relatively stable. In 1960, however, if we exclude evening and correspondence students, the trend seems in the process of being reversed on a modest scale.

of women among virtually all branches of the national economy in the workeremployee category (industry, transportation, etc.) are due to any real change in the participation rates of women in the labor force. It does seem convincing, however, that Soviet officials can scarcely fear a labor shortage, given the efforts to reduce the number of working pensioners,13 and the still more important conversion of millions of workers and employees to a shorter work-week. In connection with the latter, however, the critical observer might well keep in mind the British and American studies during the war which showed the inefficiencies of an excessively long work-week and the increased production which often occurred when working hours were reduced.
Many Western observers (including the present writer) have attempted to compare assumed changes in the working-age population with the planned goal of increasing workers and employees by 11,900,000 by 1965. Such comparisons, it now seems, are not too meaningful. First, we do not know the volume of unemployed and other labor reserves which were untapped during the seven years preceding the initiation of the current plan, although scattered evidence suggests that it was considerable. Second, the coverage of the worker and employee category has in recent years been expanded in at least two major ways, making comparisons with earlier data difficult: (a) of greatest importance is the, in a sense, artificial inflation of this category by the inclusion as a result of a state de-

Recently Khrushchev has come out very strongly for the re-employment of pensioners in productive work, without loss of pension.

cree of several million persons as "workers and employees" who a year or so earlier were considered "collective farmers"; (b) also of significance is a similar inclusion in "workers and employees" of some 1,400,000 persons formerly listed separately as "members of productive cooperatives."
No conclusive answer can yet be given concerning the probable success or failure of the Soviet government in coping with the manpower pinch during the seven-year plan period. The data seem to indicate that the lowest point was reached during 1958-60 when, interestingly enough, above-plan increments of workers and employees were achieved (apart from the artificial increases mentioned above). The labor supply situation, as indicated by the data on working-age population, should become more favorable each year from now until the end of the seven-year plan period. Finally, one should never forget that laborforce shortages are, except in extreme situations, relative in nature, particularly in a country like the USSR, where the government has the possibility of tightly controlling the allocation and re-allocation of labor, and where decisions can be made to sacrifice one segment of the economy for the benefit of another.
Rather than a labor supply problem, the Soviet government seems to be facing the critical problem of achieving a massive geographical redistribution of the labor force away from the overpopulated western regions where large labor surpluses exist in many large cities as well as in the countryside, to the new centers of industrialization in the east. This problem has recently been widely discussed in the Soviet press and journals, and radical changes may be expected in the near future in labor-force policies, particularly in regard to recruitment and

to control over turnover among specialists and others.14
CONCLUSION
Although the information supplied by the Soviet authorities is still somewhat lacking in clarity and totally deficient in critical detail, some of the Soviet population trends are clearly visible, and the data provide important clues to future developments.
Recent rates of Soviet population growth are quite high, and if they remain constant in the future, the USSR's population will double in 35-40 years. It seems likely that even during the next decade the rate of industrialization and urbanization will slow down appreciably, although continued substantial shifts of population and labor force from rural-tourban as well as from urban-to-urban areas may be expected. A leading feature of future population trends in the USSR is likely to be a still more extensive movement of peoples to Kazakhstan, Central Asia, Siberia, and the Far East.
The Soviet Union's population is characterized not only by a diversity of peoples; these peoples often have markedly different rates of natural increase (excess of births over deaths). As compared with average annual increases of 17-18 per 1,000 inhabitants for the USSR as a whole, for example, the natural increase of the Estonians is only about 5 per 1,000 inhabitants, while the rate is 33 per 1,000 for the Azerbaijani. If these disparities

were to continue in the future, the Estonian population would require 80 years to double; the Azerbaijani would double in 25 yearsl Numerous other differences could be cited. However, it should be kept in mind that it is not these relatively small groups which will determine the future ethnic structure of the USSR, but the mortality and natality rates of the three predominant groups--the Russians, Ukrainians, and Belorussians.
The educational reform of 1958 will probably slow down--in the short run at least--the rate of growth of higher education graduates, and the quality of educational training will be markedly changed. In the long run, however, the Soviet government will undoubtedly again provide the basis for a rapid expansion of higher and secondary education, although it seems that some of the qualitative revisions associated with the reform (such as production training in the lower grades) may become more or less permanent aspects of Soviet education.
During the past decade the age-sex structure of the Soviet population has tended each year to become more "normal" from the point of view of its age and sex composition. Nevertheless, a quarter of a century will be required before the excessive imbalance in the sex ratio of the population aged 32 and above can become "normal" (modest excess of females). The severely depleted cohorts of 194148, on the other hand, have already entered the child-producing ages and their reduced numbers will continue to influence child-bearing in Russia until well beyond the third quarter of the century.
