AMONG THE ASPECTS of human behavior which have become increasingly susceptible to behavior genetics research are those aspects termed personality. Following the lead of such workers as Scott and Fuller (1951) and Thompson (1953) on the social and emotional behavior of animals, and the use of the twin method to investigate the genetic components of variation in human cognitive and social behavior by Eysenck (1951), Cattell (1960), and Vandenberg (1962), the present research is addressed toward clarifying the conflicting views surrounding the magnitude of the genetic component in the etiology of the psychoneuroses. Previous research in this area has been handicapped by the lack of a valid and objective taxonomy for neurotic phenotypes, attachment to a Mendelian framework leading to the use of twin concordances rather than posing the problem in terms of quantitative genetics, and, finally, no provision for sex differences in the heritability of neurotic phenotypes despite the recurring observation of a greater prevalence rate for females. Pioneering interests in the genetic aspects of the psychoneuroses have come mostly from outside this country (e.g., Slater, 1953; Shields, 1954).

The solution to the problems of taxonomy adopted in the present research involved substitution of psychometric patems obtained by the subjects on scales which had been empirically derived by the discrimination they made between phenotypically normal subjects and diagnosed criterion groups with phenotypically abnormal behavior (Hathaway and Meehl, 1951). Although most of the scales to be discussed were originally conceptualized in the context of descriptive Kraepelinian psychiatry, they were not expected to measure pure traits or torepresent discrete entities. The old idea of a disease entity has little utility in thebehavioral sciences, since we are most often dealing with continuity, not discontinuity, and measurement, not categorization. Personality scales, therefore, represent dimensions or continua of behavior, not categories. Such scales thus lend themselves to the assumptions of polygenic inheritance (Falconer, 1960) and allow the use of non-psychiatric subjects. Since each item in a scale was answered in a certain direction by a significantly greater proportion of the psychiatric criterion group than the normals, the greater the proportion of items endorsed in the same fashion as the criterion group, the greater the probability that a new subject is like the criterion group and the greater the probability of overlap in the polygenic systems underlying the phenotypic similarity. These statements are made with all due regard for the complexity of the gene to behavior pathway (Fuller and Thompson, 1960).

Thirty-four pairs each of identical (MZ) and fraternal (DZ) same-sex adolescent twins from the public high schools of Minneapolis, Saint Paul, and Robbinsdale, Minnesota, served as the sample for this study. The entire population of same-sex twins among the 31,000 children in the school was first enumerated. Forty-five pairs of girls and twenty-three pairs of boys volunteered, which constituted 75% and 43%, respectively, of the total possible twin pairs available in the selected sample of schools. Disregarding sex, the twins comprised 60% of the possible 113 pairs.
At the time of testing, the twins filled out a personal history sheet, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), and Cattell's High School Personality Questionnaire (HSPQ); they were weighed, measured for height, fingerprinted, and photographed. The diagnosis of zygosity was based upon extensive blood-typing with respect to nine blood groups following the procedure of Smith and Penrose (Gottesman, 1961). This resulted in 100% accuracy in the diagnosis of the DZ twins and at least 95% for the MZ twins.
Each scale of the two personality tests was first analyzed by means of the intraclass correlation coefficient for the two classes of twins and for sex differences. Subsequent to this analysis, the heritability indices were computed from the within-pair variances, H being defined as the proportion of personality scale variance (within families) associated with genotype. Estimates of heritability from twin studies underestimate the effects of genetic factors on total phenotypic variance (Gottesman, in press). From the comparison of the total groups of MZ and DZ twins, H equalled or exceeded 25% for 6 of the 14 HSPQ factors and for 6 of the 10 standard MMPI scales.

The results for the total group and by sex are given in Table 1. Of the five factors which configurally define the neuroses as a group on the HSPQ (Cattell, Beloff, and Coan, 1958), only two had appreciable heritabilities; F, depressed vs. enthusiastic, with 56%, and O, confident vs. prone to guilt, with 46%. Factor C, general neuroticism, actually had no genetic component of variance in this sample. The HSPQ factors were derived by factor analysis and not from their power to discriminate behavioral phenotypes like the MMPI scales. The rest of this paper will concern itself with the MMPI results.
Six of the ten standard MMPI scales have been found to occur with high frequency in the configurations associated with the various psychoneurotic diagnoses. Four of these six had appreciable heritabilities: Schizophrenia, 29%; Psychasthenia, 33%; Depression, 44%; and Social Introversion, 69%. The dimensions of Hypochondriasis and Hysteria had low or no heritability in the present twin sample. An experimental scale which measures susceptibility to anxiety or perhaps general neuroticism (Block, 1961) was also analyzed, yielding an H of 34%.
When the test results of an individual are characterized by the two or three most deviant (from the norm) scores in his profile, we have what are called 2 or 3 point code types. Code D Ft, for example, means that the subject received his two highest scores on the Depression scale and the Psychasthenia scale. In one study of psychiatrically hospitalized veterans (Gilberstadt and Duker, 1960), code D Pt characterized 76% of those patients receiving a diagnosis of anxiety reaction. Ninety-six percent of the patients diagnosed as schizoid or schizophrenic reaction were characterized by the 3 point

By a simple combination of weights3 for a) the number of scales in a code with appreciable heritability, b) the magnitude of H for each scale involved, and c) the degree of accuracy with which a code had been found empirically to differentiate a diagnostic category, it was possible to arrive at a rough estimation of the importance of genetic factors for various psychoneurotic syndromes. Table 2 shows the ratings resulting from this system. The ratings of low, moderate, and high are less stable for the sexes separately because of the reduction in sample size.

With one exception, genetic factors were rated as low in hypochondriasis/somatization reaction for the total group and by sex; males with this diagnosis and with code Hs D Hy profiles were rated high. Clinical descriptions (Meehl, 1956; Dahlstrom and Welsh, 1960) of this code type suggest a strong resemblance to patients formerly called neurasthenic. It is of some interest that such patients were historically considered to have a "constitutional" weakness of the nervous system. Genetic factors were rated moderate in the phobic/obsessive compulsive reactions, perhaps low for females. Moderate to low was the rating for depressive reactions. The highest ratings with re-

spect to heredity were for the syndromes of schizoid/schizophrenic reaction and anxiety reaction. Conversion reaction or hysteria was rated the lowest for the importance of genetic factors. It is worth noting that the impetus to the psychoanalytic movement was furnished by the singular success of Freud in treating conversion hysteria. This syndrome is still considered to be the best indication for psychoanalytic treatment (Fenichel, 1945).
One of the practical applications of heritability data on human behavior in the life sciences is the rank ordering of traits and syndromes from probably most susceptible to probably least susceptible to p.ryc/jotherapeutic intervention. The relative determinism implied here is only intended to suggest alternate or supplementary use of therapeutic agents such as drugs which intervene directly at a physiological level. It is recognized that most illnesses have a psychosomatic aspect, but the results of the present research suggest that the somatic component for some of the varieties of psychoneuroses is more substantial than current practices would have us believe. If such should prove to be the case, some of our therapeutic strategies might be more effectively couched in terms of biochemistry rather than insight. A patient presenting a mixture of syndromes could have his therapist's strategic planning facilitated by knowledge of the particular heritabilities involved.
A discussion of the implications for evolution of the demonstration of heritability for numerous aspects of human personality will be the topic for another paper. At the present time efforts are being made to confirm and extend the results of this study and other results related to psychopathology in general. Use is being made of the twin-family method with a sample of 180 pairs of twins and

substantial numbers of their parents and siblings. Hopefully, this type of research will confirm the viability of the psychology X genetics hybrid.
SUMMARY
This is a study of 68 pairs of normal, adolescent twins, half identical and half same-sex fraternal, whose personality had been assessed with objective psychological tests. Zygosity was established by extensive blood typing. The research attempted to clarify the conflicting views surrounding the magnitude of the genetic component in the etiology of the psychoneuroses by casting the problem in terms of quantitative genetics, using an objective taxonomy and providing for sex differences. Heritabilities, or the proportion of within-family variance associated with genotype, for the personality scales related empirically to the varieties of psychoneurosis ranged from 0 to .69 for the sexes combined; males and females treated separately led to values ranging from 0 to .84 for this particular sample of twins. It would appear that neuroses with hypochondriacal and hysterical elements have no or low genetic component, while those with elements of anxiety, depression, obsession, and schizoid withdrawal have a substantial genetic component under the environmental conditions obtaining for this particular adolescent sample. One of the implications of these kinds of results would be the supplementing of psychotherapeutic strategies with biochemical ones for those varieties of psychoneurosis with appreciable genetic components.
