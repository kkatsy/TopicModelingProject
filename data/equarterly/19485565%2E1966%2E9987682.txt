No feature of the Indian caste society is more resistant to change than its institution of marriage. In recent years, many other aspects such as untouchability, hereditary occupation, and food pollution have weakened. The regulations governing marriage, however, have been little affected in their essential biological aspects, although marriage ceremonials are undergoing changes.
There is a general misconception that the division of the population of India into a large number of castes and tribes has lead to a great deal of inbreeding. In a genetic sense, this is not necessarily true. Numerical strength of these castes and tribes runs into thousands or even millions, and is sufficiently large not to lead to inbreeding unless there are marriages of close blood relations. Thus, in India, endogamy is to be clearly distinguished from inbreeding.
There are three important regulations which largely explain the pattern of marriages in the country. The first one is the regulation of endogamy (marrying within the group of birth) which is the most important attribute of caste (jatt). The second one is the regulation of exogamy (marrying out) which applies to sections in which a caste is divided. It prohibits marriages between individuals who belong to the same section. These exogamous sections are usually small in number (15-25 for Brahmans), are known by a variety of names (gotra, kut, etc.),

and are transmitted in the male line. One of the important consequences of this regulation, as far as inbreeding is concerned, is to prohibit marriages between children of two brothers, although there would be no bar to marriages between children of two sisters or of a brother and a sister. The third one is the regulation of consanguineous (sapinda) marriages. It prohibits marriages between two individuals related through a common male ancestor up to the seventh generation on the father's side and fifth generation on the mother's side.
Brahmans of North India, in whom this institution has evolved luxuriantly over the last three millennia, have in turn influenced greatly the marriage pattern of other populations in the country. The influence is strongest on the Hindu, but Muslims, Christians, and other communities have not escaped this influence. Among the Brahmans, there exists a basic difference between the north and the south. The consanguineous (sdpinda) regulation has been enforced with great regidity in the north. In the south, it had to be relaxed to conform to the prevailing custom of great preference for consanguineous marriages at the time of entry of the Brahman influence in the first millennium B.C. Baudhayana, one of the earliest law-givers, mentioned in his Dharmasutra that this is one of the important customs in which the south differed from the north (Sastri, 1955).

and the south. Its language is IndoAryan and thus conforms to the north. For the consanguineous marriages,however, the population in general follows the customs of thesouth and encourages them. Brahmans are caught there in a difficult dilemma. Chitpavans and Madhyandins follow thecustom of the north and prohibit consanguineous marriages. Desasth (Rigvedi), Karhada, and Saraswat Brahmans follow the custom of thesouth and encourage them (see Fig. 1).

DATA ON INBREEDING IN INDIA
It wasat the World PopulationConference in 1954 that I presented for the first time quantitative data on consanguineous marriages from India (Sanghvi, 1954). This was followed by our study of inbreeding in 12 endogamous groups in Bombay based on a sample of 6,597 marriages (Sanghvi, et al., 1956). An opportunity presented to us later to carry outa consanguinity survey of rural areas of Andhra Pradesh during 1957--

58. A sample of 6,945 marriages was collected from 39 villages spread over 14 districts. Dronamraju and Meera Khan (1961) have also published some data on inbreeding from an urban center in Andhra Pradesh. To complete this picture, data on consanguineous marriages have been collected from 500 villages spread over the country along with the 1961 census operation. These data are expected to be published shortly by the Register General of India.
Inbreeding in Bombay
In our Bombay study seven of the groups were Marathi speaking Hindu castes, viz., Desasth and Sarswat Brahmans, Kayasth and Pathare Prabhus, Marathas, Agris, and Mahars. Rates of consanguineous marriages were low among the Brahmans and the Prabhus with coefficient of inbreeding1 varying from .001 to .003. In the other three castes, it varied from .005 to .007. Among the seven castes, the consanguineous marriage type that contributed mainly to inbreeding was the matrilateral crosscousin.2 In addition, there were three Muslim groups, viz., Meman, Bohra, and Khoja; a group of Parsis and a Christian group. The coefficient of inbreeding among the Muslim and the Parsis was high varying from .006 to .013. The Christians who were Roman Catholics gave a value of .001. In all these nonHindu communities, the first cousin marriages were of all the four possible types. There was evidence of decline in inbreeding among the Parsis, but not so in any other group.
1 Coefficient to inbreeding is defined as the probability that a pair of genes at any particular locus in an offspring is derived from a single gene present in one of the ancestors common to both the parents.

SURVEY OF ANDHRA PRADESH
Our study of inbreeding in rural areas of Andhra Pradesh was a part of a survey of smoking and chewing habits in relation to oral cancer conducted during 1957-1958. Three interviewers selected from Andhra Pradesh were specially trained for this purpose in Bombay. The work was carried out under supervision and independent checks were made for accuracy of information. A total of 7,249 men above the age of 30 years were interviewed during the course of this survey. Of these, 227 were bachelors and information on consanguinity was not elicited in 77 cases leaving a sample of 6,945 marriages for this study. During a preliminary run in this area it was found that there was a high proportion of maternal uncle-niece in addition to crosscousin marriages and information beyond this was not very reliable. On the other hand, sample checks showed that a small proportion of marriages reported as first cousin were actually of the second cousin type. On the whole it appeared that these errors on either side balanced each other and the data reported here may be taken as reliable for the rural areas of Andhra Pradesh.
The main feature of the data was a high proportion of uncle-niece and matrilateral cross-cousin types which accounted for two out of every five marriages. In addition, 2.13% of the marriages were of the patrilateral crosscousin type. Two marriages in the series were recorded as between children of two sisters. On further inquiry, it was found that they were exceptions and are not tolerated in the community. In other words, both the types of parallel cousin marriages are not permitted. The coefficient of inbreeding was .032 for autosomal genes and .051 for sex-linked genes, this excess for the sex-linked genes being

contributed entirely by the matrilateral cross-cousin marriages. The patrilateral cross-cousin marriages contribute no inbreeding for sex-linked genes and the contribution of maternal uncle-niece marriages is the same for autosomal and sex-linked genes. These levels of inbreeding which are exceedingly high for any large human population may be compared with some theoretical values. If, for instance, a population was perpetuated entirely by first-cousin marriages, the coefficient of inbreeding will be .0625. If it was continued by marriages only of first-cousin once removed, the coefficient will be .0313. The figures for Andhra Pradesh lie between these values.
Geographical Variation
The survey covered 39 villages spread over 14 districts of Andhra Pradesh. Of these, three villages were studied from each of 10 districts. From Nizamabad, four villages were covered. Two villages could be studied from each of W. Godavari and Chittoor and only one from

district are presented in Table 1. There Shrikakulam. The pooled data for each was a significant variation in the pattern of inbreeding in different districts, with highest concentration in the coastal areas of Vishakhaptanam and E. Godavari. In both these districts there was a high proportion of uncle-niece marriages and the coefficient of inbreeding attained high values of .045-.048 for autosomal genes and .O58-.O71 for sex-linked genes. There ·was a gradual decline in the inbreeding levels away from the coast. In the interior districts of Karimnagar and Nizamabad, uncle-niece marriages were almost nonexistent and the inbreeding levels were comparatively low. General pattern of variation of the coefficient of inbreeding for autosomal-genes is shown in Figure 2 and for sex-linked genes in Figure 3.
Social Variation
Analysis of the data according to occupation-caste groups is presented in Table 2. The classification is based on

pulling together castes with related occupations. Farmers include eight major castes and a number of others; artisans, etc., include nine major castes and several others; shepherds, fishermen, and harijans include two, three, and four castes respectively; and Brahmans, traders (Komati), Muslims, and Christians are single groups. Brahmans and traders showed comparative low levels of inbreeding and shepherds and fishermen stood at the other extreme in this respect. The large group of farmers and artisans were in the middle near about the average values for the region.

One of the interesting features that the study revealed was the pattern of consanguinity among the Muslims and the Christians. Like the Hindus in this region, these two communities practised uncle-niece and cross-cousin marriages; but did not permit the two types of parallel cousin marriages. This was in contrast to the custom among the Muslim and Christians in Bombay, where they practised all the four types of first cousin marriages. The local custom of consanguineous marriages in Andhra Pradesh had deeper roots than could be modified

by religious influence which came there at later stage.
Dronamraju and Meera Khan (1961) reported data collected from married inpatients of King George Hospital, and from parents of school children in Visakhapatnam. The coefficient of inbreeding for the patients was .028, and for parents of school children was .019. Their data further showed that inbreeding levels were higher in persons with rural background in conformity with the findings reported above.
EFFECTS OF INBREEDING ON MORBIDITY
AND EARLY MORTALITY
Consanguineous marriages reduce the frequency of heterozygotes in the population and distribute them equally to the two homozygotes. The homozygote, which is rare, has a proportionately bigger gain. If the frequency of two alleles at a locus is equal, inbreeding has equal effect on both homozygotes. This balance progressively changes as the frequency of one of the alleles gets smaller

and smaller. The inbreeding effect is most pronounced on homozygotes which are determined by very rare genes. For instance, phenylketonuria (a severe mental defect) which has an! incidence of about 1 in 40,000 offspring of unrelated marriages in the English population rises 13 times in the children of first cousin marriages. Similar observations have been recorded for albinism, ichthyosis congenita, amaurotic idiocy, and several other conditions. (Sanghvi, 1963).
Unfortunately, our knowledge of the role of heredity and in particular of genes which, when homozygous, contribute to morbidity and mortality is woefully inadequate. In order to overcome this difficulty, a number of empirical studies have been carried out comparing the effects in children of unrelated and consanguineous parents. These studies were critically examined by the Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation set up by the United Nations (1962). A summary of these results is given in Table 3.

United States consist of three series, published in 1858, 1908, and 1958. The earliest series was collected by correspondence and the second one, by reference to genealogical and other records. The data from France were collected under comparatively uniform set of conditions. The most extensive of these studies is the one carried out in Japan in which observations were made in children from birth up to the age of eight years. In general, all these studies show that the rates of morbidity and mortality are increased in the offsprings of the consanguineous marriages as compared to those of unrelated parents. The studies are, however, of very unequal scope and reliability for a quantitative generalization.
Extension of these results to Andhra Pradesh pose another serious problem. In all the three populations mentioned above, the coefficient of inbreeding of the population under consideration was comparatively low (less than .01) and no account was taken of inbreeding history of the population in the past. On theoretical grounds, it is likely that the situation in Andhra Pradesh may turn out to be very different and the effects on morbidity and mortality may not be as large. In order to estimate the decline in the frequency of deleterious genes, I have made some theoretical calculations as outlined below.
THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS
A random mating population with a certain incidence of lethal homozygotes (e.g., phenylketonuria) will have an increased incidence of this trait if it resorts to inbreeding. If inbreeding con-

tinues over a period of generations with a constant intensity (say, F), the incidence of this trait (aa)and the frequency (q0) of the lethal gene (a) will continue to diminish. If the gene in the original population was maintained by mutation, an equilibrium will eventually be reached. If the gene was maintained by advantage of the heterozygote, it will ultimately be lost. The scheme in Table 3a gives the first generation offspring of a population which has resorted to inbreeding (F).
The frequency of the trait aa will increase from q02 in the parental generation to a frequency qo2+Fpoqo in the first generation of offspring. If it is lethal (i.e., t=l) and inbreeding (F) continues for n generations, then qn, the gene-frequency in the nth generation, will be given by the following recurrence relation under the assumptions that there is no mutation (u=o) and no advantage of the heterozygote (k=o):

Similarly qH_1=qn.2(l -F) - q\_2(\ -F) and q\.1 = qin.1(l-F)2
if terms of third and higher order of q are neglected.
Substituting these values in (1), we get

-q\-*(l-F)*

(2)

Substituting similar values for qn-2, we get

continuing this process backward for n generations, we finally get

We have not taken into account so far the conditions necessary for equilibrium. Assuming that the equilibrium was maintained by a mutation rate u, we get the recurrence equation

Proceeding as above, we get

If the equilibrium was maintained by advantage of the heterozygote (k), the recurrence equation becomes

This has the same form as (1) when

where y = (l--F1)n and F1=F--k+Fk

With the help of equations (A), (B), and (C) it is possible to determine the fate of a gene under inbreeding over a period of generations. I have considered here three values of gene-frequency corresponding to an incidence varying from one affected per every 10,000 to one per million, under random mating. Mutation and selection rates required for equilibrium are given in Table 4. In subsequent calculations I have considered the consequences under mutation hypothesis and under selection hypothesis separately. For practical considerations, it may be pointed out that a large number of estimates of mutation rates in man cluster around the figure 2.5 xlO-5, corresponding to a gene-frequency of .005 and the corresponding incidence of 1 in 40,000.' Effects of inbreeding for periods of 50, 100, and 150 generations are given i in Table 5 (F=.05), Table 6 (F=.03) and Table 7 (F=.0I).
The results in Table 5 correspond to a situation that may exist for sex-linked deleterious traits in Andhra Pradesh. The effect is most pronounced on genes which are comparatively common and are maintained by an advantage of the heterozygote. For instance, gene-frequency declines from a value of .01 to a value of .000124 in 100 generations and correspondingly, incidence of the deleterious trait diminishes from a value of 591 affected per million to only

six per million. If this gene was,however, maintained by mutation, the genefrequency will tend towards its new equilibrium value of .002 giving 104 affected per million. Thus the results under the selection and mutation hypotheses are also strikingly different. Similar but less striking results are obtained for q = .005. For rare genes (g=.001), there is a decline in gene-frequency, but the differential effects of mutation and selection are not marked to be of practical significance.

The results in Table 5 (F=.03) correspond to a situation that may exist for autosomal recessive diseases in Andhra Pradesh. Gene-frequency for a trait such as phenylketonuria (^=.005) would have reduced to a frequency of .000994 under a mutation hypothesis and to a frequency of .000323 under a selection hypothesis at the end of 100generations. The initial incidence of 174 affected per million would reduce to 31 per million under mutation and 10 per million under selection hypotheses. If the initial gene-frequency was high (q=.01), the results are more striking. In Table 6 the results are given for F = .01 for comparison. The effect continues on rare genes, but not so marked as in the previous cases.
The results given above show how frequency of deleterious alleles would have considerably declined in a population such as that of Andhra Pradesh under inbreeding over a period of two millennia or perhaps longer. The effects of inbreeding observed in other areas of the world could not therefore be directly projected to this region. It would be most desirable to undertake such an observational study. In addition to the practical value of such a study to the population concerned, it would contribute useful information to our theoretical knowledge on the subject. For in-

stance, there is no direct evidence that deleterious autosomal recessive traits in man such as phenylketonuria or ichthyosis congenita are maintained by mutation. The inference of mutation is based only on indirect reasoning. An observational study of the type suggested here would provide for the first time such urgently needed evidence which has an important bearing on problems of human mutagenesis.
SUMMARY
Available data on inbreeding in India are reviewed. India is divided into two geographical zones: the north, with comparatively little inbreeding and the peninsular India with very heavy inbreeding. For instance, the coefficient for autosomal inbreeding in Bombay varies from .001 to .013 in different caste and religious groups and in the rural districts o£ Andhra Pradesh it varies from .015 to .048. Besides first cousin marriages, the practice of uncle-niece marriage is also prevalent in several parts of south India.
Available literature on genetic effects of inbreeding in human populations is briefly reviewed. In general, all these studies show that the rates of morbidity and mortality are increased in the offspring of consanguineous marriages as compared to those of unrelated parents. The studies carried out so far are, however, of very unequal scope and reliability for a quantitative generalization. In addition, areas such as those of Andhra

Pradesh where the levels of inbreeding are very high and where this custom is prevalent for two millennia or perhaps longer present a more complex situation. An observational study in such an area is urgently needed.
Formulae are given for calculating the decline in the frequency of deleterious genes under inbreeding over a period of generations. They take into account the alternative assumptions of mutation and selection for maintaining deleterious alleles in the base population. Under certain conditions, the decline in genefrequency is very marked. It also turns out that the consequences of mutation and selection hypothesis are sufficiently distinct in some cases so as to be useful to contribute direct evidence for the existence of mutation for recessive autosomal diseases in man.
