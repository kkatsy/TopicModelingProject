W.HEN HUMAN SERUM is subjected to
electrophoresis in starch gel (1), it is possible to differentiate the hemoglobinbinding a-2 globulin (haptoglobin) and the iron-binding ß-l globulin (transferrin or siderophilin) into a number of patterns. These variations in molecular structure are genetically determined, inheritance studies indicating the probable existence of at least five allelic haptoglobin (Hp) genes, and at least 12 allelic transferrin (Tf) genes (2, 3).
The inhabitants of most areas of the world have one of three alternative haptoglobin phenotypes, Hp 1-1, 2-2 and 2-1, representing homo or heterozygosity of two genes, Hp1 and Hp2. With few exceptions, this applies to the Pacific populations, so that a description of the rare subtypes is not germane to this discussion. It should be noted, however, that the Hp 1-1 and Hp 2-1 types can be further subdivided on the basis of the electrophoretic migration rates of two alternative Hp 1 polypeptides representing the alternative alíeles HpTM and Hpis (4). Since this subtyping involves hapto-

globin purification, reductive cleavage and separation on gels containing 8M urea, data on geographic distribution of the two Hp1 genes is not yet available.
Although 12 molecular forms of transferrin have been described, most of them are so rare that only four homozygous and 11 heterozygous phenotypes are known. Thus the genetic relationship among their respective genes is assumed, but not proven, to be allelic. Transferrin C is by far the most common molecular form, and therefore most human subjects are assumed to be homozygous for the gene called Tfc. Of the six transferrins which have a slower migration rate (all being designated by the letter D and an appropriate subscript), it is probable that Dx and DCM have the highest worldwide frequences, whereas the five fast-moving transferrins (named B with a numerical subscript) are rarely found in more than two per cent of a given population.
The purpose of this paper is to summarize the presently available information on the distribution of the Hp and Tf genes in Pacific populations. The data in Tables 1 and 2 were obtained from published reports and unpublished information kindly provided by colleagues or from our own studies.

·Since ahaptoglobinemia is uncommon in most of these populations, the Hpi gene frequency can be assumed to equal l-Hp* gene frequency.

DISCUSSION
As shown in Table 1, the inhabitants of theAsiatic mainland characteristically have low Hp1 gene frequencies, ranging from about nine per cent to 28 per cent in various population samples. As might be expected, the Japanese andFormosans resemble the mainlanders in this respect. Among the Polynesians, the Hp1 frequency is considerably higher (i.e. 45% to 60%). The somewhat intermediate position of thePhilippine islanders probably represents inter-racial admixture.
The sampled tribes in New Guinea consistently show a high Hp1 incidence, but in Australia there is said to be considerable variation (5). The only published results of starch gel electrophoresis analyses are those which appear in the table, representing a Western desert tribe.
On the North American continent, there is an apparent difference in haptoglobin gene distribution between the Eskimo and Indian populations, with a

high frequency of Hp1 in the Indians of southwestern United States as well as Central America. Considerable variation among the various Venezuelan Indian tribes has been reported (23), although the general tendency is for increased Hp1, in some instances approaching the very high frequency found in the one Chilean and three Peruvian tribes tested. Sutton (21) has suggested that there is a cline, beginning in Asia with low levels of Hp1, progressing to Alaska and increasing to a maximum Hp1 frequency from North through Central and South America.
In Table 2, which summarizes the data on transferrin phenotype frequencies, the various subtypes among the slowmoving (D) and fast-moving (B) proteins are not indicated because reference sera have not always been available for purposes of comparison. In general, the "slow" transferrins are distributed irregularly throughout Asia but are heavily concentrated in New Guinea and Australia, as well as parts of Central and South America. Because of the fact that the gene determining Tf Dj has a relatively high frequency in some areas of Africa, it will be important to determine if the apparent examples of Tf Dj reported in the Pacific area actually represent the recently described Tf DCM (25), from which it is difficult to differentiate by conventional technics. Another finding of potential significance is the high frequency of a fast-moving transferrin (Bo.!) among Navajo Indians (19) as well as in the Lacandon tribe of Central America (27). This protein has not been encountered in other ethnic groups.
Genetic drift is undoubtedly a major determinant of the gene distribution in population isolates. Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that the individual phenotypes may be associated in some

manner with processes of natural selection involving such regional environmental factors as temperature, diet and or infectious disease agents. It is unlikely, however, that the known physiological functions of the two proteins (i.e., the binding and transport of hemoglobin and iron, respectively) are directly involved in maintaining these polymorphisms. Recent studies (28) have failed to show any measurable differences among the transferrins in their ability to combine with iron or to deliver it to the marrow for hemoglobin synthesis. Furthermore, although it is well known that the level of serum haptoglobin usually varies according to phenotype (so that 1-1 > 2-1 > 2-2), the resultant differences in hemoglobin-binding capacity are not related in any obvious way to physiologic advantage.
SUMMARY
Distribution of the haptoglobin and transferrin genes in Pacific populations has been partially investigated. The available data are summarized and briefly discussed in relation to the origins of the populations and the hypothesis that these proteins may play some role in natural selection processes.
