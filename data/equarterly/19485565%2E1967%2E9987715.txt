The article by Baker (1966) reflects some of the methodological difficulties that occasionally seem to arise between physical anthropologists on one hand, and human population geneticists on the other. Baker (1966, p. 89) correctly indicated that part of the problem is terminological. Nevertheless, at the risk of sounding repetitive, it seems that further clarification is in order.
It is evident that adaptation, as seen in the current literature, is defined in far too broad terms to be very useful. The remainer of this communication will be an elaboration of this point and a presentation of a much narrower definition, already long familiar to population geneticists, but more scientifically adequate.
Adaptation, in evolutionary terms, has been couched largely in mathematical language due to the pioneering work of Fisher, Haldane, and Sewall Wright in the late 1930's and early 1940's.
Adaptation can be considered as a function of natural selection and in its simplest form as

W=l-s

(1)

where W refers to adaptation or fitness and s is the selection coefficient. Simple inspection shows that if the selection coefficient is large (but less than I), the fitness (adaptation) will be correspondingly small.
The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium can then be set up as (Li, 1955a)

* Currently on a leave of absence.

W = p*Wu+2pqW12 + q*WM (2)
where W is the "average fitness" of the whole population.
While an extended stochastical treatment is not germane here, suffice it to say that it has been available in the literature for over 30 years.
Certain aspects of adaptation, if adaptation is to have any evolutionary consequence, have become apparent since the rise of population genetics. (1) First and foremost, it must be stressed that "adaptation (W) is a response of population rather than individuals" (Li, 1955b), since to talk about individual adaptation does not make much sense as individuals cannot react for the needs of the population as a whole. (2) Selection, in opposition to the Darwinian "survival of the fittest" has to be translated into differential reproduction. This idea of differential reproduction statistically states that the organism that produces the greatest number of viable offspring is the most "fit" in the modern evolutionary sense. (3) Since we are assumedly talking about hereditary characteristics it takes generations, usually a considerable number of them, before any measurable changes in gene and genotype frequency become noticeable. This is particularly the case when dealing with human populations.
It is the contention here that unless the three above conditions are recognized, it becomes useless to talk about adaptation as an evolutionary episode.

Sickle-cell anemia is beyond doubt an example of a human adaptation to the environment, with malaria being responsible for maintaining the balanced polymorphism, which reverts to a predictable transient stage once the environment becomes nonmalarial such as the United States. (Allison, 1955). This has been experimentally verified and clearly satisfies the three stipulations outlined above.
But sickle-cell anemia is a classic example of a single gene substitution which makes the different genotypes easy to detect, since they represent obvious differences. This is not the case however, when dealing with the majority of human traits, and particularly those that have been so-called "racial" characteristics such as skin color, stature, etc. It is evident that any attempt to try to explain the adaptation of continuous variation (polygenic inheritance) is beset with difficulties.
While it is axiomatic that a considerable proportion of the visible as well as invisible biological variation in the human species is hereditary, its genetic structure remains uncertain at the moment. Moreover, the question of plasticity cannot be ignored, which compounds the difficulty of trying to separate the genetic component from the environmental variables. (Hülse, 1960).
Such traits as skin color, stature, body fat, surface area, and a host of others, have had more than their share of usage as "racial markers" in the past or more recently as examples of adaptation due to selection. What all these supposedly adaptive polygenic traits seem to have in common is a less than satisfactory explanation as to how such traits are selective, this being the obvious consequence of a generally recognized lack of knowledge regarding the underlying genetic structure. Further, such climatic adapta-

tions (Baker, 1958, Roberts, 1953) seen as physiological differences undoubtedly exist, but they have simply not been shown to have a genetic component and hence do not fall under the definition of adaptation proposed earlier in this communication.
Baker's adherence (1966, p. 83) to "the fact that man conforms as well as any species to Allen and Bergman's rules" seems questionable in view of the many exceptions to these rules. The impression these rules are valid as wide-sweeping biological laws is a regrettable one (Hülse, 1960; Scholander, 1955; Wilber, 1957).
While the gathering of a considerable body of descriptive data is always a necessity, what is even more sorely needed at this time, is a theoretical approach which will allow verification of the many assumptions concerning adaptation and selection of polygenic systems which have been debated in the literature now for a good long time.
