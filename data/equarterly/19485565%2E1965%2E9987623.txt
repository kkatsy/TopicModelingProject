THE CHANGING PATTERN OF POPULATION CONCENTRATION IN INDIAN CITIES*

INTRODUCTION
A lot of research has been carried out to discern an empirical regularity in the distribution of cities and towns by size, the pattern of which was observed to be the same for many countries large in population size and high, moderately at least, in the level of urbanization. Zipf's formulation of the rank-size rule was that of an inverse proportional relationship between rank and size, but later studies have conclusively shown that this law is not obeyed by habitats at all times and at all places. This is because urbanization is a dynamic process--a process of population concentration having two dimensions: (1) increase in size of individual concentrations, and (2) increase in number of points of concentration-- (Eldridge), and habitats experiencing these two-fold changes cannot be expected to follow a uniform pattern.
The urban scientists, in their attempt to establish an appropriate mathematical model have found what may be called the generalized rank-size rule given by the formula y =axb (Pareto's equation), where y is the population of the city of rank x, habitats being arranged in decreasing order of population. The parameter a refers to the size of the largest city and the exponent b is negative

(Zipf's formula is a particular case of Pareto's equation with b---- 1) and both of them are subject to temporal and spatial variations. Criticisms have often been raised that builders of this model have little to justify its use by establishing causal relationships between the related variables, but these questions are as unreasonable as to ask why a variable varies or why a variable has a given statistical distribution. The fact that a mathematical model is found to be reasonably satisfactory in a number of occasions justified its use in absence of a better model, and the onus should lie on the critics to disprove the propriety before its validity can be questioned.
The model builders have so far been guided by the simple consideration that habitats can always be arranged in diminishing order of population, irrespective of their location patterns, dispersions, and internal diversifications-- factors that are dependent on total population, social organizations, technology, and natural resources, and (for big cities at least) on international interdependence. They are perhaps not unaware of the structural and functional aspects of cities and of the fact that the growth and pattern of urbanization are related to a multiplicity of interdependent factors, but the study of their nature and strength of association is a difficult task, as few of the variables lend themselves to quantification. Elimination of some such

variables, of course, leads to a weaker relationship, while permitting some important generalization on the overall pattern including short-run projections.
The present paper aims to study the trend of Indian urbanization using the data available in the censuses on the distribution of habitats in different sizeclasses. Even such a simple series cannot be satisfactorily used because of changes in Indian boundary from census to census, apart from other usual errors of census data. It might have been possible to adjust the distributions for each of the census years to current Indian boundary, but the amount of labor and time involved in this would be beyond the scope of this paper. We have, however, restricted ourselves to the recurring assumption that the relative distribution of habitats by size-classes has remained invariant to areal changes.
The census reports show distributions of habitats according to size-classes as well as the corresponding total resident populations. As indicated before, it was not possible to adjust for errors of enumeration or for incorrect shifts between size-classes which, it is presumed, would not substantially alter our findings. Subject to these, an attempt has been made here to study the variations in three interrelated variables: (1) size-class; (2) rank, as available from the distribution of habitats; and (3) population. The nature of these variables is such that an observed relationship between any two of them can be checked through the third. Thus, if rank and size are related, the relationship must provide population estimates within any given size-class.
MODEL APPROPRIATE TO INDIAN SITUATION
The Office of the Registrar General, Government of India, has attempted to obtain a relationship between rank x

and the cumulative population Y of all cities having ranks from / to x. The form of relationship described by this model is the same as that contained in the generalized rank-size rule, i.e., Y and x are linearly related on a double-log scale. The results (not quoted here) obtained are apparently satisfactory when the graduated series is compared with the actual. But the ambiguity, otherwise latent, manifests itself as soon as the third variable, namely the size-class, is introduced in the picture. That is, the model based on rank and cumulative population fails to reproduce the distribution of habitats or of population by size-classes. The purpose here is to emphasize that a model seemingly satisfactory may finally prove to be anomalous, and use of any model must therefore be made with caution.
Clearly, then, the cumulative population and cumulative number of habitats do not obey Pareto's law, although at given points, the curve may be straightened on a double logarithmic scale. Treating Y as the independent variable does not either, as may be expected, make any improvement. So it may be concluded that the underlying rule, if any, governing the relationship between these variables is not given by Y^ax*, at least for the Indian situation. Further, if the relationship between rank and size can be described by Pareto's law, and if such a model is found to reproduce the distribution of population reasonably well, then the incompatibility of a similar relation between Y and x can be easily shown.
In our attempt to investigate the pattern of relationship, we have decided to restrict ourselves to urban areas only. Although data were hard to find, we have used, for censuses prior to 1951, the habitats of size 5,000 and over as urban

areas and have disregarded smaller towns, assuming that oversize villages were proportionately rarer in those days. We feel that this assumption will not seriously affect our results. For the later censuses, however, we have been careful to avoid, as far as possible, the large villages and to make some rearrangement in upper groups in order to avoid boundary confusions.
The ranks x obtained from the cumulative distribution of habitats have next been taken to correspond to the lower boundaries y of the respective size-classes. This procedure does not involve any assumption, as it can easily be verified from the population distributions of cities. We have then tried to fit the generalized or modified rank-size rule starting from the census of 1891. The method, as usual, is to find the linear regression of log y on log x, i.e.:
£(log y) = log a+b log x
The expected value of the largest city is provided by a and b (which is negative), the slope on a double-log scale, measures the relative decline in population size for cities of given ranks. Temporal changes in a reflect the growth of the largest city (the rank need not remain invariant over time), and changes in b measure differentials in growth of cities of varying sizes. Thus, a larger b (absolute value) indicates greater population differential between successive ranks, and conversely for a smaller b.

The values of the parameters as observed since 1891 are given in Table 1.
Comparison between the expected and observed sizes of the largest city presents difficulty because of the inherent problem in delimiting city boundaries. However, the figures are comparable in orders of magnitude. Estimates by size-classes (Table 3) are much better. The changing pattern of b (which is all through unidirectional) points out that during the seventy years of India's urbanization, larger cities have grown relatively more rapidly than smaller cities. This is so because if at time periods t^ and t2, the parameters are alt blt and a2, b2, respectively, then the ratio of populations for rank x will be (a2/a,)x h~\ such that the exponent of x is negative where both b's are negative but b2 is numerically larger than bx. Thus, the ratio decreases with increase in x. When bx = b2, as was the case during the last two censuses, the ratio becomes independent of x and hence assumes a constant value. The constancy of b appears largely to be due to real slowdown in the rate of urbanization during 1951-61 and to some extent due to different criteria used to determine urban areas in the censuses of 1951 and 1961. As a result, a number of places, especially in the smallest category, was excluded from the list of urban areas in 1961, but which according to the principles followed in 1951 census could have passed the tests of urbanization.

ever, the exclusion of these areas (which are small in size), does not drastically alter the population distribution by sizeclasses. Nor does it seriously affect the estimates of the proportion of urban to total population (see Discussion of Results for further discussion) and the parameters a and b.
The constancy of b may also indicate a turning point in India's pattern of urbanization. In the future, b may continue to decrease in numerical value. In that case, the pattern of growth will be reversed; i.e., the growth rate of larger areas may fall behind that of smaller areas. As a result the pace of India's urbanization may be slowed down. The present trend supports that fact as may be seen from Table 2.
It would appear that urbanization had been increasing at an accelerated rate until 1951. The rate was highest during 1941-51, after which it declined. True, a part o£ this decline might be due to changes in the definition of urban areas from 1951 to 1961, but the magnitude of this, as indicated before, would hardly be significant in effect. The forces that possibly helped the growth during 1941-51 must have been strengthened in the following decade which marked the first phase of economic planning. Thus

it might have been expected that the growth of urbanization would continue during 1951-61. But the observed fall in the growth rate in the decade tends to cast doubt on the prospects of rapid urbanization in future.
It may be recalled that the relationship between rank and cumulative population was found unsatisfactory as the model failed to adjust itself when the third variable, namely the size-classes, was taken into consideration. The adequacy of the present treatment using rank and size can not therefore be established unless a comparison is made between the actual and derived population distributions by size categories. The latter can be obtained from the following formula, where the first equation estimates the population of all the towns having ranks from 1 to « in decreasing order of population:
12
S ax* = 2 ax*- S ax"
In Table 3, the expected and observed population have been compared for the two recent censuses.

1 This approximate relation follows from the well-known Euler-Maclaurin formula (see Whittaker and Robinson. The Calculus of Observations, p. 135):

In our example o= l, /i = l and f(x)=xh. It can be seen that terms involving third and higher order derivatives become very small in comparison to those preceding.

It may be observed that there is a difference between observed and estimated urban population for both the years. The reason is that linear regression was used on the logarithmic transformations of the variables which, as such, does not automatically ensure equality between the actual and expected totals of the original variables, although it does so for the transformed variables. Adjustments must therefore be made before goodness of fit can be tested, and one such method may be to convert both the observed and estimated distributions in percentage forms. In that case, an overall measure of divergence can be obtained by calculating the index of differential composition A which is defined as the absolute sum of all the percentage differences with identical signs. The computation of Afor the year 1961 is shown in Table 4.
The value of A indicates that in the distribution of the observed population, only 3.21% of the total need be shifted to appropriate places in order to obtain a perfect correspondence with the expected distribution. It may, however, be noted that the value of A depends to some extent on the number of class intervals used. For example, if an interval is split into two, A may increase if the percentage differences for these two di-

visions happen to have unequal signs. Otherwise, A will remain the same.
Obviously, A is meaningless when the observations are not classified. In that case A becomes equal to zero. But if there are at least two groups that can be used to classify the data, A may lie anywhere between 0 and 100. Smaller value of A is an indication of lesser disparity between the two distributions, although any value of A is subject to a downward bias as mentioned before. However, the amount of bias is expected to be small, if the distributions compared are free from large irregular fluctuations. Even a few groups may be enough for practical purposes, if the selection of groups is independent of the

distribution patterns Thus, if three points are arbitrarily chosen to divide each of two distributions into four parts, then it will be extremely unlikely that A will be quite small even though the distributions are widely dissimilar. True, the power of the test increases with the number of groups, but it seems that A calculated from as few as five or even four groups may not be too far from reality. Therefore, comparison of A's based on different number of groups may not be unjustified.
In Table 5 values of A have been recorded for the successive censuses where the number of class intervals prior to 1951 was five, except in 1891, when it was only four.
The values of A suggest that the fit is uniformly satisfactory, which establishes the validity of this model. Thus, it may be concluded that a Pareto pattern of relationship cannot be formulated between rank and cumulative population, since, mathematically as well, the validity of such relationship is precluded by the validity of rank-size rule.
DISCUSSION OF RESULTS
The differential growth pattern of habitats may be examined now. For

this, we shall compare the percentages of population by size-classes for successive years, and our measuring coefficient will be the same index of differential composition A.
Increase in concentration of population in larger cities with increase in urbanization is apparent from Table 6. Variation in A is also commensurate with the increase except for the last one, which is a bit higher. It may be recalled that the 1961 definitions of urban areas became more clear and uniform than they were during the previous censuses. If procedures similar to 1951 were followed in 1961, the percentage in 5 to 10 thousand category would have been higher, and other percentages would have been proportionately reduced. In that case A would be smaller because the positive differences contributed by the last three size-classes would be reduced. Further, the percent urban to

total population will also rise. Forexample, if the percentage in the first size-class is raised from 9.0 to, say,12.0 (a large increase), A will decline to 8.2 and per cent urban will increase to 18.5. The differences, though not appreciable, add more consistency to the figures.
Next, we pass on to consider the effect of population growth on the average size of habitats by size-classes. Interestingly enough, average size within a given size-class has changed very little since 1891, and we may therefore conclude that the exit from and entry to a sizeclass have had very little influence on the pattern of distribution within it. This maybe seen from Table 7, which is based on all areas, urban and rural.
This table appears to have useful application to thederivation of estimatesof population distribution in the near future provided we can work out probable shifts of habitats along thesize-axis. Like vital rates, one can define size-class specific growth rates as the ratio of the difference between number of habitats in any size-class over a given time period to the number at the beginning of that period. Projection of these rates as well

as the average sizes in each size-class can be made by examining the past trend as well as the current and prospective future events that might influence their variations.
Of these two components, the latter, namely the average size, was found to change very slowly, and an extrapolation to near future on the basis of past trend may not be too erroneous. Like projections of future mortality rates, which can often be made with sufficient accuracy, it may be expected that projections of average size can be made fairly accurately in view of its relative stability.
Projected size-class specific growth rates will probably be less accurate (like projected fertility rates). One approach seems to be to concentrate on areas near the upper boundaries of any size-class and examine the possibility of their movement to the next higher category. This might improve the quality of estimates more than when the specific growth rates are projected as such. On the other hand, mathematical projections based on the model described in this paper may also be made. It may bere-

called that this model was primarily restricted to urban areas of sizes 5,000 and over, and further, the accuracy of this projection, like any other, will depend on the extent to which future estimates of the parameters of the model come closer to reality. In this connection it may bepointed out that thedeviation of the parameter a from thelargest city size is less important. More important from practical point of view, however, is to what extent the parameters a and btogether can estimate theredistribution of habitats by size-classes.
The utility of this method of population projection can not be emphasized until this is put to intensive testing. However, it seems that this approach to population projection has interesting possibilities and may open up other avenues of research. The prevalent method of population projection is based upon estimates of age-specific mortality and fertility rates together with a population distribution by age and sex. The method suggested here depends on the distribution of habitats by size-classes, the sizeclass specific growth rates, and average size in each size-class. If successful, the projected population by size-classes, being complementary to the projected agesex distribution, will meet an entirely different need of the planners.
SUMMARY
A linear relationship on a double-log scale (Pareto's equation) between rank and size has been found to be satisfactory

for Indian cities with population 5,000 and over since 1891. This result proves that an identical form of relationship does notexist between rank andcumulative population of cities up to that rank, although such a fit may be apparently satisfactory. There arein all three interrelated variables; namely, (1) habitats, (2) population, and (3) size-class. Asa result, the existence of a relationship between any two of them must be validated through thethird.
It has been noticed that the distribution of habitats within each size-class is positively skewed; and, further, average size of a habitat within each category has been very little influenced by the population redistribution over the past seventy years. This, together with the possibility of estimating the rate of shift of habitats from one size-class to another, appears to suggest an independent approach to population projection. Ifexperiments with this method prove tobe successful, then projections by sizeclasses will provide new kinds of information that will supplement those provided by the standard method, namely, projections by sex and age.
