TECHNIQUES OF STRATIFIED SAMPLING IN THE STUDY OF VARIATION OF THE HUMAN SEX RATIO

MARIANNE E. BERNSTEIN Boston, Massachusetts

Variations in the sex ratio at birth in Man and other mammals has been studied extensively by zoologists, sociologists, anthropologists, biostatisticians, and others. This has led to two, if not more, almost entirely different methods of obtaining unbiased data for studying this complex problem. Zoologists, such as Weir (1962), King (1918), and others including this author (1954, 1961) have concluded that, if small, homogeneous strains of animals, or groups of animals, or groups of humans, living under homogeneous environmental conditions are compared, the evidence is overwhelming that the sex ratio is controlled by genes, located on one, or most probably several chromosome pairs. However, if we greatly enlarge our sample often, if not always, such clear-cut differences as have been found by Weir in mice, by King in rats and by Martinez and this author in humans belonging to the upper social strata (Bernstein and Martinez, 1961) will become statistically unreliable, or opposite in direction, or disappear entirely. For instance, Weir and his associates had found, for almost a decade, that mice from a high blood pH line had about 15% more male offspring than mice from a low blood pH line through many generations of breeding. However, recently, repetition of the selection experiments of Weir by Wolfe (1961), "on a more comprehensive scale, led to production of new high and low

blood pH lines, but without the same correlated response for sex ratio . . ." (Weir, 1962).
Biochemical evidence suggests that specific genes control the amino acid sequence involved in the formation of specific enzymes in a living organism, and that the enzymes in turn regulate various metabolic actions. Mutations in genes are believed to result in altered enzymes, many of which trigger slightly different and often abnormal metabolic actions. One such abnormal metabolic action in man is involved in the diseases of the thyroid gland (myxodemia, Graves' disease, goiter, etc.). Scandinavian family data which had been collected by Bartels (1949) at the Copenhagen University Institute of Human Genetics, were made available to this author (Bernstein, 1951) and analyzed as to sex ratio irregularities. These data, as shown in Table 1, represent the totality of patients treated in Copenhagen since World War II for Graves' disease, and is a sample only insofar as Copenhagen contains only a small number of the world's patients suffering from Graves' disease. For his data, Bartels believes the gene or genes responsible for Graves' disease to be dominant in females but recessive in males; this author, therefore, listed four separate types of families depending on who, besides the prepositus suffering from Graves' disease, was affected with a thyroid disorder. Another, second set of data on thyroid disorder and its link to sex ratio variation is available from Finland. In a sample of 143 mothers

suffering from goiter, fewer sons (66) than daughters (77) were reported by Hillesmaa (1948), and since this sex ratio of 49.0 is not significantly different from that found by Graves for the children of mothers with abnormal thyroid activity, 51.3% male, the Finish data of Hillesmaa were added to the data in Table 1. It appears from the data of Table 1 that a disturbance in the basal metabolism of the human acts detrimentally toward the Y chromosome bearing sperms or the male zygotes during pregnancy in some unknown way. Possibly the fact that human males have a slightly higher basal metabolism than females normally has a bearing on this phenomenon on the apparent interrelation on thyroid activity of parent and sex ratio of offspring.
In 1954 this author reported a statistically significant relationship between sex ratio of offspring and occupations of both fathers and mothers. This prompted Martinez (1956) to investigate a possible relationship between sex

ratio and body build of both father and mother, since Heath in 1954 had published some evidence of a triangular relationship between occupation (i.e., college major), sex ratio of offspring, and somatotype of fathers who had been students at Harvard University. Martinez collected and analyzed somatotype data and information on sexes of children for 60 completed families of his private medical practice in Bogota, Colombia, S.A. Martinez found evidence of a significant relationship between size of Rhorer's index (weight/cube root of height) of either parent with sex ratio; and a still stronger interrelationship when data from both parents are combined in these 60 upper class families of almost pure Spanish descent.
Martinez also worked with a set of 68 families from the U.S.A., i.e., data published by Davenport in 1923 of families with Anglo-Saxon, Scotch, Irish, German and a few Italian surnames. This author believes that, when the somatotype of fathers only, as calculated by Martinez, is considered, the tabulations of the Davenport U.S.A. data do not show any meaningful correlation between Rhorer's index and sex ratio of offspring. It is interesting to note that for the Davenport data the values of Rhorer's index extend over a greater range (.95 to 2.25) than the values of Rhorer's index of the Colombian men (1.04 to 1.85), even though the two samples are almost of equal size (68 U.S.A. men vs. 60 Bogota men), indicating that the U.S.A. data constitute a racially more heterogeneous group than Martinez' own data from Bogota, Colombia. Apparently there is some assortive mating in the U.S.A. families (Martinez, personal communications, 1965), with stocky men marrying stocky women, for when somatotype data of both fathers and mothers were combined

by Martinez the sex distribution of the offspring in the 68 Davenport families related to somatotype of parents comes to resemble the distribution in the 60 Colombian families.
What appears to be a racially and socioeconomic homogeneous group of families is considered in the study by Damon and Nuttall (1965) on somatotype of fathers (ponderal index; height/ cube root of weight) and sex ratio of children. Results obtained by Damon and Nuttall on these fathers of "Old American" stock indicate that "the stockier the men, the more likely they were to have sons," (possibly Heath obtained similar results on the same set of data in 1954), whereas Martinez in upperclass Spanish-Colombian men had noticed an opposite interrelation. The Damon-Nuttall data constitute a sample of Harvard alumni with the data on offspring obtained 25 years after graduation. Though economically and sociologically they may (or may not) be comparable to the Colombian men of Martinez, they are quite different racially, so that the genes involved in the interrelation, if any, between somatotype of father and sex ratio of offspring may act quite differently chemically in the two or more racial groups involved. A finding by the physiologist J. B. Hamilton (personal communication, 1952) may have a bearing on this. Hamilton studied "the relationship between body mass and quantitative degrees of masculinity." He found that for younger men "such a relationship might be found to exist among members of a specific race or anthropological group, but not in comparisons of S. W. Europeans with N. E. Europeans, i.e., they are like diverse entities."
Another genetic factor has to be considered. In the Davenport data as ana-

lyzed by Martinez, both parents and offspring are adults, since Davenport was studying the inheritance of body build. A total of 34 families had both or one parent 60 years of age or older and were not considered by Martinez in his studies of sex ratio of offspring; however, he had to retain the families in which one or both parents were between 40 and 60 years of age in order to have enough data, and this introduces a bias in favor of long-lived families.
A relationship between type of occupation and length of life is indicated in the statistics on standardized mortality rates for males (whites only considered here) and occupations as published by Guralnick (1962) for the U.S. Public Health Service, using U.S. Census Bureau data. This author (1951) had found a relationship between occupation of fathers and sex ratio of offspring, and therefore each of Guralnick's occupational group can be assigned to one of two classes depending on whether, according to our tabulations, the specific occupation belonged to a group with an excess of male or an excess of female offspring. A small number of occupations from Guralnick's data had to be omitted; college professors as a group were not broken down according to subject matter taught, authors not classified as to whether fiction or nonfiction writers, nor doctors listed as to whether practicing or research doctors or psychiatrists, though in our studies the two kinds of professors (those teaching languages and social studies as against those teaching physical sciences) the two kinds of doctors (practicing doctors and surgeons as against research doctors, psychiatrists, and pediatricians) and the two kinds of writers (fiction writers as against reporters, nonfiction writers, and editors) showed very

different sex ratios for their offspring. In Table 2 we list standard mortality rates (the average for white male professionals given by Guralnick was 85), a theoretical figure indicating the likelihood of dying between the ages of 20 to 65 years of age. It appears that, by and large, occupations with usually an excess of daughters had below average standard mortality rates, whereas occupations with usually an excess of sons have average or somewhat above average mortality rates.
This author made a more direct study testing the hypothesis that there is a correlation between span of life and sex ratio of offspring. Utilizing biog-

raphies listed in Who Was Who in America, 1951-1960fivehundred fathers were chosen who had an excess of daughters among their children; for them the average age at death was 73.36 ±.425 years, whereas for 500 fathers who had an excess of male offspring, the average age at death was only 69.83±.447 years. The difference in age at death of 3.53 years has a standard error of less than .47 years and is statistically highly significant, in spite of the relatively small number of cases. Sampling was carried out with the goal of genetic and sociological homogeneity in mind. Using the biographies of Who Was Who in America, 1951-1960 confined the sample to the well-to-do, so that induced and otherwise avoidable abortions are at a minimum. The theory that the sex ratio at conception is much higher than at birth and that a minimizing of avoidable abortions (Bernstein, 1948) has been raising the secondary sex ratio in the educated, well-to-do classes practicing more scientific methods of birth control, has received new confirmation in the cytological studies of Petrikova et al. (1964). For 653 normal fetuses aborted for therapeutic or social reasons in the third to fifth month of pregnancy, the number of males per 100 females was found to vary from a high of 178 in the third month to 136 males in the fifth month of gestation. Secondly, all deaths in the data from Who Was Who in America, 1951-1960occurred between 1951 and 1960, the most advanced period in medical history, when a majority of upper class Americans died of degenerative rather than epidemiological diseases. At first fathers having an excess of sons and fathers having an excess of daughters were chosen without regard to occupation, but it soon became apparent that the arithmetic differences in length of

life for the two groups would not be statistically reliable with the limited number of cases available in the reference book. The author then decided to delineate the two classes further by chosing the 500 fathers with more sons only if at the same time they were engaged in what previously she had designated (Bernstein and Martinez, 1961) as "masculine" occupations. Similarly, the 500 fathers with more daughters than sons all were engaged in what the author had previously labelled as "feminine" occupations. By insuring as much as possible the anthropological, socioeconomic, and historical homogeneity of our sample, a pleiotropic gene complex appears to have been isolated which has wide-range physiological and psychological effects throughout life. This gene complex appears not only to affect choice of occupation and variation of sex ratio of offspring at the beginning of adult life, but to be involved in the rate of aging. It is interesting to note that for the group of fathers engaged in "feminine" occupations and having more daughters than sons, the average length of life, 73.37 years, is about equal to an average of the 1951-1960 expectation of life at birth for white women as reported by the Vital Statistics Division of the U.S. Bureau of the Census.
SUMMARY
The author presents evidence that the technique of stratified sampling must be applied in studying genetic, environmental, and anthropological causes of sex ratio variation. Data on length of life so collected point to an interrelationship between sex ratio genes, choice of occupation and rate of aging for 1,000 upper-class U.S. fathers listed in Who Was Who in America, 1951-1960. In another anthropologically homogene-

ous sample of families afflicted with Graves' disease, as collected in Denmark by Bartels (1949), the author found evidence of an interrelationship between abnormal thyroid disorders of fathers, mothers, and sex ratio of offspring, quite similar to a Finish study by V. Hillismaa in which the effect on the sex ratio of offspring was studied for goitrous mothers.
Data on body build of parents and sex ratio of grown offspring published by Davenport in 1923 and analyzed by Martinez (1956) comprise a quite heterogenous group racially and cover a time period during which significant changes in the sex ratio have been demonstrated by the author (1948). The Davenport data are not derived from the same population universe as the data collected by Martinez in Bogota, Colombia, nor the data on body build of Harvard alumni discussed by Damon and Nuttall (1965), and they show no significant relationship between body build of fathers only and sex ratio of offspring. The significant curvelinear correlation between sex ratio of offspring and somatotype of father found to exist for Harvard alumni is opposite in direction to the correlation found to exist in the Spanish-American families of Martinez'; the author believes that a somewhat different mutation of probably the same gene is involved in the two, racially differing populations, with the two alleles triggering differing pleiotropic actions.
