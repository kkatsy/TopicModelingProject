WHITE AND NONWHITE FERTILITY BY CENSUS TRACT FOR 1960

J. WILLIAM LEASURE AND NICHOLAS W. SCHROCK

PURPOSE
This study was designed to examine the relationship between fertility of whites and minority groups, primarily Negroes. The analysis is based on census tract data for urban areas in 1960 as well as aggregated data for these areas. Initially, the two largest Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSA's) of California were to be investigated. Then four other SMSA's of moderate size were selected for purposes of comparison with other regions of the United States. The six are: Los Angeles-Long Beach, San Francisco-Oakland, Atlanta, Mobile, Cleveland, and Philadelphia. The purpose of the analysis is to obtain some understanding of the nature and extent of the relationship between whites and nonwhites with respect to fertility and its variation by region. Regional differences may be a reflection of the different degrees of assimilation by nonwhites of the values of whites with respect to desired family size. For example, a stronger positive relationship in the North vis-avis the South between white and nonwhite fertility by census tract could indicate more social and cultural integration on the census tract level or for the SMSA in general. Not enough SMSA's are examined for an exhaustive statistical analysis; yet some insight may be obtained which can facilitate more extensive studies.
Census tracts are the smallest unit for

which censal data are reported. If other things are equal, it is generally true that a smaller geographic area is more homogeneous than a larger one with respect to income, education, and related social and economic characteristics. Thus, data by census tract rather than data for larger areas are preferable for an analysis of fertility based on racial differences apart from differences in income and education.
When data for larger areas such as the SMSA are aggregated and averages are used, some of the relationships among the population units comprising the aggregate can be obscured. For example, fertility and income might be inversely correlated for aggregated data but directly correlated for subgroups within the aggregate. Also, averages do not show the variation within the aggregate. However, both approaches are needed as they can supplement one another.
RESULTS
The child-woman ratio is used as the index of fertility. It is the number of children aged 0-4 per 1,000 women aged 15-44 enumerated in a census.1 Table 1
1 The child-woman ratio is affected by childhood mortality and for 1960 the U.S. infant mortality rate per 1,000 was 43 for nonwhites and 23 for whites. The rate for ages 1-4 was only 7 for nonwhites and 4 for whites. Thus, if the child-woman ratio were adjusted for mortality, the differential between white and nonwhite would be slightly larger. However, comparisons would not be significantly altered by such slight differentials in mortality, and urban nonwhite mortality is probably closer to white than is total nonwhite.
This ratio is also affected by misenumeration. In 1960 underenumeration of nonwhites under age 5 for the U.S. is estimated at about 7% and

gives the white and nonwhite mean child-woman ratio for the entire SMSA as well as the white and non-white median based on the mean for each census tract within the SMSA where there are at least 400 nonwhites. Thus, the median is based on only a part of the population in each SMSA. Even if the mean andthe median figures were based on the same universe, the two could differ as a result of differences in the fertility levels of census tracts by size of population. For example, if there are three census tracts each with 1,000 women aged 15-44, and the child-woman ratios in each are500, 600, and 700, the median will be 600 and the mean for the total will be600. But if one census tract has 2,000 women aged 15-44, and a child-woman ratio of 700, while the other two each have 1,000 women and ratios of 500 and 600, the median will be 600but the mean for the total will be 625. The largest census tract has the greatest weight in determining the mean for the entire area.
The interpretation of the classification of data with respect to white and nonwhite is given in Appendix 1. In the San Francisco-Oakland SMSA, nonwhite is separated into those tracts where nonwhite is at least 75% Negro, and where nonwhite is at least 75%non-Negro. In this SMSA the nonwhite non-Negro group is probably dominantly Oriental.
As expected, the nonwhite fertility is substantially higher than thewhite. With the exception of the mean for San Fran-
for whites, about 1.8%. (See Donald S. Akers, "Estimating Net Census Undercount in 1960 Using Analytical Techniques," [unpublished] paper presented at the annual meeting of the Population Association of America at Madison, Wisconsin, May 1962.) Therefore, if adjustments were made for underenumeration, the differentials between whites and nonwhites would be larger. However, the ranking and the order of magnitude of the correlation coefficients would not be altered unless underenumeration varied significantly by SMSA and census tract.

cients for the child-woman ratio by census tract between white and nonwhites and between whites and those with Spanish surnames for the two SMSA's in California. Except for California, the r2 do not exceed 27%; i.e., no more than 27 per cent of the variation in nonwhite child-woman ratios by census tract is related to variation in the white ratios. However, in the San Francisco-Oakland and Los Angeles-Long Beach SMSA's, the r2 are 47 and 48%, respectively. In contrast to this, the r2 in these two areas for whites and nonwhites (non-Negro) and whites and those with Spanish surnames are either statistically not significant or are relatively low. The much lower correlation coefficients for childwoman ratios between all specified combinations excepting those for whites and nonwhites (Negro) in Los Angeles-Long Beach and San Francisco-Oakland lends

emphasis to the significance of these two coefficients.
Similarity of ratios for whites and nonwhites could be interpreted in a number of ways. Nonwhites may be acquiring the family size attitudes of whites in the same census tract. Or, it may be that both whites and nonwhites in the same census tract are emulating a third group outside their geographic area. Also, the whites living in the census tract with nonwhites may be those with attitudes towards family size that are more similar to the nonwhites than the whites in other tracts. However, the difference between the SMSA's in California and the four other SMSA's indicates that whatever the factors are, they differ by area. And the differences could well reflect varying degrees of social and cultural integration.
Nonwhite fertility by census tract was plotted against median family income and median school years completed. On the basis of scatter diagrams we concluded that the relationship was weak or nonexistent. It appears that other variables may be more important and relevant.
Table 3 ranks the SMSA's by the mean child-woman ratios for whites and nonwhites. Except for Philadelphia, the ranking generally indicates that white and nonwhite fertility rates move in the same direction.
Another interesting relationship is

seen in Table 4 by ranking SMSA's according to correlation coefficients between white and nonwhite child-woman ratios by census tract and according to the spread or difference between white and nonwhite median census tract childwoman ratios. Only the SMSA of Atlanta shifts rank. The ranking is similar to what would be expected if it were postulated that the similarity in the levels of white and nonwhite fertility for the entire SMSA were directly related to the similarity by census tract. If similarity by census tract implies some social and cultural integration, then these statistics lend support to the hypothesis that as racial integration continues, the difference between the white and nonwhite levels of fertility will disappear.

CONCLUSIONS
Aggregated data show a tendency for the levels of white and nonwhite fertility to be directly correlated with each other, although nonwhite is always substantially higher than white. Thus, averages for the entire SMSA show evidence of similarity with respect to reproductive performance. Within the aggregates, however, the similarity by census tract is weak except in the two SMSA's in California. As stated previously, aggregated data may show a relationship, but for subgroups within the aggregate

such is not always the case. Speculation on these facts seems warranted even though the investigation was limited in scope.
California is reputed to be a land without tradition. Relative to such established areas as the East or the South, the people have been uprooted andcustoms are in the process of formation. Where both white and nonwhite groups are establishing new habits, the period of transition may permit a more effective communication of ideas and attitudes which would be reflected in fertility. The high degree of similarity between the data for Los Angeles-Long Beach and San Francisco-Oakland is manifest in both the absolute levels of white and nonwhite fertility rates and in the relationships between them by census tract. By contrast, the relationship between fertility for whites and those with Spanish surnames is weak. The Spanish-speaking people have retained many of their traditions, and it may be that this prevents them from readily adopting other attitudes.
Our results seem to support some aspects of the transition theory regarding the decline in fertility. Among other things, this theory--which is admittedly broad and general--states that changes in the social structure lead to a change in attitude toward family size. The similarity by census tract between whites and nonwhites for the two SMSA's of California may be the result of this uprooting of people and tradition. Such a cleavage with the past may make the nonwhites more receptive to the attitudes of whites who live in close proximity. When aggregate data for the entire SMSA's are used, child-woman ratios for whites and nonwhites show some relationship in the other cities also. Here, too, there appears to be a desire on the

part of nonwhites to adopt the attitudes of the whites. However, it may be that cultural integration is not sufficient in these cities to permit this relationship to appear by census tract also.
This interpretation is not based on data from an extensive study. More investigation would be valuable. Our hypotheses can be submitted to additional tests when the 1960 data on children ever born are released. These data are given on an individual basis and are cross-classified with color, education, and occupation. However, as a preliminary, 1950 census data on children ever born to women aged 15-44 were calculated for whites and nonwhites by state. The 23 states having more than 30,000 nonwhite women in 1950 were ranked according to the ratio of white to nonwhite. The southern states tend to have the lowest ratios; i.e., the differences in white and nonwhite fertility are relatively larger in the south. This is some further support, albeit limited, for our hypothesis that social integration will tend to bring white and nonwhite fertility closer together by lowering nonwhite fertility. Appendix 2 presents the ranking described above.
APPENDIX 1
Only those census tracts were analyzed for which characteristics of nonwhites are reported separately; i.e., those tracts where at least 400 nonwhites were enumerated. Where those with Spanish surnames or those of Puerto Rican birth or parentage are reported separately for the same census tracts, their totals are subtracted from the data for whites leaving non-Spanish surname or non-Puerto Rican in the white category. When a census tract had less than 400 of either of these two groups, data are not reported separately; hence, white will in-

clude those with Spanish surnames or those of Puerto Rican birth or parentage. However, in these cases, the latter groups are usually a small percentage of the total white population.
In addition, no comparisons between white and nonwhite were made by census tract if the white population after the above adjustment was less than 400. This criterion corresponds to the requirement for separate reporting of nonwhites. A further requirement is that there be at least 45 children reported in the ages of 0-4. This stipulation eliminates some of the more extreme cases where the tract area comprises some atypical family housing area.
The last stipulation is that a nonwhite census tract is classified as Negro if at least 75% of the nonwhite population is Negro. Except in the case of San Francisco-Oakland where many Orientals reside, the census tracts not meeting this requirement were excluded from the analysis based on census tract data. Therefore, nonwhite refers primarily to Negro. In the San Francisco-Oakland area, those nonwhite census tracts with a population of at least 75% non-Negro are classified separately. The San Francisco-Oakland tracts which were neither primarily Negro nor primarily nonNegro were excluded.
The aggregated data for whites exclude those with Spanish surnames and those of Puerto Rican birth or parentage where such data are reported separately. The aggregated data for nonwhites include Negroes and non-Negroes.
APPENDIX 2
Ranking of states with more than 30,000 nonwhite women according to the ratio of white to nonwhite children ever born per 1,000 women aged 15-44 is the following:

It should be noted that, at least with respect to California and New York, the large Puerto Rican and Spanish-American populations tend to raise the white fertility rates. Errors in reporting may vary by state, but the trend is clearly from the southern to the northern states.
