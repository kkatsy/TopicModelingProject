A. OPULATIONS OF RELATIVELY RECENT HY-
BRID ORIGIN provide u n i q u e material for
the detection of linkage, and may thus indirectly bring to light evidence for the genetic bases of variations in human behavior. Although associations between hereditary variations within established and stable populations cannot be considered as evidence for linkage, this principle does not hold for relatively new hybrid populations. Unlike genes belonging to a single alleic series, those at different loci do not attain equilibrium within a single generation within hybrid population but approach it over a number of generations (Rife, 1954a). Moreover, linked genes approach equilibrium more slowly than those located on different chromosomes, the rate of approach in linked genes being inversely proportional to the closeness of the linkage.
Suppose the parent populations of a hybrid one differ greatly in the frequencies of each of three pairs of alleles (Aa, Bb, and Cc). Let us further suppose that two of these sets of alleles (Aa and Bb) are closely linked, whereas the third set (Cc) is located on another pair of chromosomes. This will result in a higher and more persistent association between Aa and Bb, than between either Aa and Co or Bb and Cc within the hybrid population. In other words, higher and more persistent associations between some hereditary variations than between others within mixed populations may be considered as evidence for linkage between the former. This is especially true if the traits under consideration play no part in the selection of marriage partners, and if the associations are absent in stable populations, or vary in expression from one hybrid population to

another. Associations of this sort were recently found between patterns of the second interdigital area of the palm and shade of pigmentation within populations of mixed Negro-White origin (Rife, 1954b).
The foregoing methodology need not be restricted to the detection of the linkage relationships between known genes but may be extended to include traits whose possible heritabilities are as yet unsolved. It could be especially useful in the investigation of the role of heredity in bringing about variations in behavior, for it is difficult to visualize how nongenetic factors could bring about persistent associations with some simply inherited variations and not with others, within populations of hybrid origin, having essentially the same cultural background. During the past year the author had an opportunity to investigate three African populations of mixed origin for associations between simply inherited variations and behavior. These included 130 prisoners in Zanzibar; 51 Goans at the Kololo Secondary School in Kampala, Uganda; and 135 Cape Colored people in Capetown, South Africa. This paper is concerned with a preliminary report of the findings.
The Zanzibar Prisoners
The prisoners at Zanzibar were almost entirely of East African Bantu-Arab origin, with a preponderance of the former. Arabs and Bantu intermarry quite frequently, and varying degrees of intermixture were apparent among the prisoners. The majority were completely illiterate. Data were obtained on the following traits; ABO blood groups, cell sickling, finger and palm prints, stature, length of fingers, length of tibiae,

and discrimination of differences in weight. The last item required the subject to arrange three small boxes of the same size (approximately .5 cubic inches each) in order of their weights, from light to heavy. Their respective weights were 5, 6, and 8 grams. Among the 130 persons tested, 48 arranged the weights correctly, 82 incorrectly. No significant associations were found between ability to discriminate between weights and any of the physical traits employed.
The Goans
The Goans are largely of mixed Indian and Portugese descent, with the physical characteristics of Indians predominating. The Kampala Goans are almost entirely Roman Catholic and live largely within their own community, having their own societies, churches, and primary schools.
Data obtained from the 51 students included the ABO blood groups, palm and finger prints, a form board test consisting of 88 items which the subject attempts to assemble in 7 minutes,1 and the same weight discrimination test which was administered to the prisoners at Zanzibar. They rated much better on the weight discrimination test than did the prisoners at Zanzibar, 32 out of the 51 subjects doing it correctly.
No significant associations were found between either the blood groups or the hand prints with the form board test results, nor were either the blood groups or the form board tests found to be associated with performance on the weight discrimination test.
Tables 1, 2, 3, and 5 show the results of tests for association between hand prints and weight discrimination in each of the three mixed populations. In all of the tables and throughout the remainder of the paper, C symbolizes the group which was successful in the weight discrimination test.

and I the group which failed it. Note that there is no evidence for associations between palm patterns and weight discrimination in the Goans, but that there is a marked difference between groups C and I in the incidence of whorls on fingertips, members of group C in having over 15 per cent more than group I. The difference in the mean number of whorls per person of C and I groups is 1.5 ± 0.70, a significant amount, although not highly so. Arches occur in a slightly lower frequency in group C. The higher frequency of whorls in group C is reflected in a higher ridge count (Table 5), but here the difference is statistically insignificant.
The Cape Colored
The colored people in Capetown are chiefly a mixture of Malay and HottentotBushman, with some infusion of Bantu and European ancestry. Dr. Ronald Singer, of the Department of Anatomy at the University of Capetown, arranged for and assisted the author throughout in working with 135 Cape Colored people. These consister of 35 employees of the Medical School (sample 1 in the tables), and 95 male patients and 5 female nurses at the Brooklyn Tuberculosis Infirmary (sample 2) at Capetown. Hand prints were taken, and each person was tested for ability to discriminate between the weights. Group C includes 76, and group I includes 59 persons.
Tables 1, 2, and 3 reveal marked associations within both samples of Cape Colored between inability to discriminate between weights and the incidence of arches on fingertips, and also between ability to discriminate between weights and the incidence of palm patterns. Table 5 reveals a statistically significant difference in the mean ridge counts of C and I groups, C being higher. Table 4 shows that the higher incidence of arches among population I within the Cape Colored is attributable to a widespread distribution, rather than to only a few individuals manifesting high frequencies of them. This is not true

of the Zanzibar population. The magnitude of the differences among both samples of Cape Colored in the occurrence of ridge counts, arches, and palm patterns in populations C and I seems to establish beyond any reasonable doubt that they are real, and not due to chance fluctuations.
Discussion
Two out of the three hybrid populations which were investigated revealed significant associations between the ability to discriminate between weights and the incidence of patterns on hands. Whorls are the most highly developed patterns, and arches are actually patternless configurations. Among both Goans and Cape Coloreds pattern intensities on fingertips are higher among the C than among the 1 groups. This differ-

ence is expressed among the Goans by significant differences in the incidence of whorls, among the Cape Colored by corresponding differences in the frequencies of arches in C and I groups. Arches occur with slightly higher frequencies in the I than in the C group of Goans, while whorls occur less frequently in the I than in the C group of Cape Coloreds. These trends are illustrated in Table 1.
These differences are consistent with the rule that in populations throughout the world the incidence of arches varies inversely with that of whorls. African Bushmen have among the highest frequencies of arches known, slightly exceeding that of whorls. The fact that they comprised one of the major components of the ancestry of the Cape Coloreds likely accounts for the

marked difference in the incidence of arches in the C and I groups. Goans, as well as other Asians, are characterized by relatively high frequencies of whorls and low frequencies of arches, which may account for the wide difference in the incidence of whorls rather than arches, between C and I groups.
Ridge counts are used as another criterion of pattern intensity, and they are correlated to some extent with the incidence of whorls. Arches always have a ridge count of zero, and whorls tend to have higher numbers of ridges than do loops. Moreover, ridge counts have the highest heritability of all dermatoglyphic configurations (90 per cent in dizygotic twins according to Holt, 1952). Absence of a statistically significant difference between C and I groups of Goans in ridge counts, plus low significance of the difference in the percentages of whorls raises doubt as to whether or not these differences are real. But there is little or no room for doubt concerning the significance of the differences observed among the Cape Colored. The difference in the mean ridge count values of C and I groups is almost 2.6 times the standard error, indicating the odds are approximately 99 to 1 against it being due

to chance alone. The Cape Coloreds also show highly sig-
nificant associations between p a t t e r n s (loops, whorls, and vestiges) on the thenar/ first and second interdigital areas of the palm and weight discrimination. These differences are statistically significant on each of these areas, and are highly significant when pooled (Table 6).
The thenar/first interdigital and second interdigital areas are adjacent to each other, and patterns have higher heritabilities here than in other palmar areas. Moreover, it has been established that positive correlations exist between patterns in these two areas (Cummins and Midlo, 1943). Correlations exist not only between the incidence of patterns in these areas but also between intensities on fingertips and on the second interdigital area (Rife, 1943). Table 7 shows comparisons of the pooled incidence of patterns among individuals within the thenar/first interdigital and second interdigital areas, plus the absence of arches. These differences between the C and I groups are the most significant of all.
Finger and palm patterns are highly heritable and are established long before birth. Moreover, they are of no known

what thesame cutural influences through-

out their lives. In view of these circum- Summary

stances it seems impossible to account for the associations between hand patterns and weight discrimination performance onan environmental basis. Variations in the degree of association from one hybrid population to another, plus the absence of any associations between blood groups oranthropometric variations with either weight discrimination or theform board performance test strongly suggest linkage between genes responsible for hand patterns and ability to discriminate between weights. This implies, of course, that most likely there is a genetic basis for ability to discriminate between weights.

Samples of the three populations of hybrid origin (Zanzibarians, Goans, Cape Colored) were tested for associations between heritable physical variations and the ability to discriminate between small weights. Nosuch associations were found among the Zanzibarians. A significant association was found among Goans between the incidence of whorls on finger tipsand ability to discriminate between weights. Highly significant associations were found between both finger and palm prints and weight discrimination among the Cape Colored. These findings indicate a genetic basis for differences in the ability to dis-
