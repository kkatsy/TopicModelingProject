r RECENT CHANGES IN THE FERTILITY OF CONGREGATIONAL MINISTERS

CHRISTOPHER TIETZE, M.D. SARAH LEWIT

A,,,N INCREASING BODY OF INFORMATION Olí
the reproductive behavior of the American people has become available in recent years, and additional important contributions are expected in the near future. Most of this material has been derived from data collected on a nation-wide scale by such government agencies as the Bureau of the Census and the National Office of Vital Statistics. Nevertheless, opportunities still exist for special surveys of highly selected, homogeneous small groups, to be undertaken by private individuals or organizations.
An investigation of this type, described as the Congregational Ministers' Eugenic Survey, was carried out during the spring and summer of 1952 by the Reverend Bedros Baharian of the Quincy Point Congregational Church, Quincy, Massachusetts, and Mrs. Betty U. Kibbee of the Population Reference Bureau, Washington, D. C. The present authors had no part in planning the survey, but the records were made available to them for statistical analysis.
The Congregational Ministers' Eugenic Survey was conducted by mail. A brief questionnaire in postcard form over the signature of Pastor Baharian was mailed to all Congregational ministers in the United States. The information requested on the questionnaire was limited to the minister's year of birth, the fact and year of marriage, the number of his children, and the year of birth of each child. The original mailing list comprised 4,024 names. About half responded to the first questionnaire. Two additional mailings brought the total response to 3,108- Of these, 45 came from women or lay persons and were discarded,

leaving a total of 3,063 cards for analysis. This number represents slightly more than three-fourths of the original list--no mean accomplishment in a mail survey. The response ratio was fairly uniform throughout the country, except in the South where only three-fifths answered.
It is generally assumed that non-respondents in a fertility survey are more likely to be unmarried or childless than those who respond. To test this hypothesis, an effort was made to achieve by telephone complete coverage of a small subsample. For reasons of convenience, the Boston metropolitan area was selected for this purpose. Of the 184 ministers listed for that area, 146 had responded to the mail survey, 28 gave the required information over the telephone, 6 refused, and 4 had apparently left town. Of the 28 ministers reached by telephone all were or had been married, as compared with 94 per cent of the mail respondents in the Boston area. The average number of children per minister was the same in both groups. Because of the small numbers in the subsample, the result of the test is not conclusive as far as the entire survey is concerned, but at least it lends no support to the belief that non-response has introduced a serious bias.
Of the 3,063 ministers included in the analysis, 2,953 were or had been married at the time of the survey. Together they had produced 7,004 children. Only 27 ministers--less than one per cent--failed to report the year of birth while a somewhat larger number, 48, did not state the year of marriage. The year of birth was not given for 77 children. The "unknown" cases were distributed pro rata.

Because the information obtained in the survey includes the year of birth of the children, it was possible to compute measures of current1 fertility for a series of past years. Table 1 presents total fertility rates per 100 ministers for the period 1922-49. A total fertility rate represents the number of births that would occur if the current age-specific rates would prevail throughout the reproductive life span of the parental generation, and may be computed on the basis of male or female fertility. Total fertility rates per 100 white males in the United States have been entered in Table 1 for comparison. These are based on estimated numbers of births, corrected for under-registration. All figures shown in Table 1 are 5-year sliding averages, assigned to the middle year- For example, the figures for 1922 are based on births occurring during 1920-24.
The total fertility rate per 100 ministers declined from 309 in 1922 to a low of 215 in 1937. From that point it increased steadily to 334 in 1946 and remained virtually at the same level to the end of the period of observation. The increase from 1937 to 1946 amounted to 55 per cent. The trend was similar to that for white males in the United States although the initial decline among white males was somewhat greater than among the ministers, and the recovery, somewhat smaller. As a result, the relative positions of the two series were reversed in 1940. Prior to that year the total fertility rates were slightly lower for the ministers than for the generality of white males; subsequently the rates were slightly higher among the ministers.
Total fertility rates reflect the age-specific rates for the year or group of years on
1Used here to designate measures of fertility based on the events (births) of a given year or group of years. Into this category fall most of the conventional measures of fertility, such as birth rates, fertility rates, and reproduction rates. Terminology on this subject is still fluid. Stolnitz and Ryder (Population Index, 15(2): 114-128, April 1949) refer to "synthetic" rates. French demographers, e.g. Louis Henry ("Fécondité des Manages," Paris, 1953), speak of rates "of the moment."

which they are based. They do not necessarily present an adequate picture of the underlying pattern of fertility. Such a picture may be obtained by cohort analysis which is concerned with the actual reproductive performance of successive cohorts. Each cohort comprises the persons born (or married) in the same calendar year or group of years and is followed as close to the present time as is possible. For any cohort that can be followed to the end of its reproductive life span, the total number of children born per 100 persons can be computed. Comparison with more recent cohorts is possible in terms of the number of children born up to stated ages (or stated durations of marriage).

in 5-year sliding averages. The same pattern is used in all subsequent tables. Because only the years of the minister's birth and marriage, and of the birth of each child, and not the actual dates, were obtained in the survey, the "stated age" and likewise the "stated duration of marriage" in Table 5 do not refer to the exact age in completed years, but to the middle of the preceding year of life, e.g., to 29y2 years, or the middle of the 30th year, instead of exactly 30 years.
The earliest cohorts shown in Table 2, i.e. those born in 1870-89, can be followed to age 60 which may be considered the end of the male reproductive life span- By this age, the cohort of 1870-79 had produced 324 children per 100 ministers and the 1885-89 cohort had produced 280. Later cohorts can be observed for successively shorter periods. The latest cohort, designated as "1920," comprises the ministers born in 1918-22, the youngest of whom can be followed only to the 30th year.
The earlier cohorts present a clear picture of declining fertility. The number of children ever born per 100 ministers, prior to age 45, dropped from 292 (1870-79 cohort) to 235 (1905 cohort), a reduction of 20 per cent. The cohort of 1906 appears to represent the low point of fertility. This cohort comprises the men who reached the age of marriage and family formation during the economic depression of the 1930's. This cohort has not yet reached the end of its reproductive life span. It may be expected to produce a few more offspring and to eventually reach about 240 children per 100 ministers.
Later birth cohorts show a steep rise in the number of children ever born per 100 ministers up to the age to which they can be followed. The relative increase of fertility prior to 30 years of age from the lowest cohort to the most recent cohort is 112 per cent--from 58 children per 100 ministers in the 1907 cohort to 123 children per 100 ministers in the 1920 cohort. Fertility prior to 35 years of age increased 32 per

cent--from 140 children to 185 children (Chart 1).
To a large extent, these increases have been the result of a trend toward earlier marriages noted among the ministers as well as in the general population. Table 3 shows that 52 per cent of the ministers born in 1920 were married before reaching age 25, and 91 per cent before age 30; while of the 1910 cohort only 27 and 73 per cent, respectively, were married by these ages; and even lower proportions among men born in the 19th century. For white males in the United States the same trend is illustrated by the following percentages ever married at age 30, obtained in successive censuses:

Year Per cent 1930 73.0 1940 74.7 1950 84.4
As shown in Table 3, the proportion ultimately married has been very high among the ministers throughout the period cov-

ered by this study. If all the surveyed men in the more recent birth cohorts should eventually marry, which is unlikely, the record of their predecessors would be increased by an insignificant amount.
When children ever born are related to married ministers only, rather than to all ministers as in Table 2, the sharp increases in the numbers of children born to later cohorts are noticeably diminished. This is evident in Table 4 which shows children ever born per 100 ministers ever married. In contrast to relative increases of 112 per cent and 32 per cent, respectively, for all ministers. Table 4 reveals increases of only 70 per cent at age 30--from 80 children per 100 married ministers in the 1907 cohort to 136 children per 100 married ministers in the 1920 cohort--and 29 per cent at age 35--from 150 children to 194 children.

Because of the declining age at marriage, the ministers in the more recent birth cohorts have been married for longer periods by the time they reach a given age, on the average, than men in earlier cohorts. This factor accounts in part for the increases in

the number of children produced by the more recent cohorts prior to each stated age. To eliminate as far as possible the influence of the shift to an earlier age at marriage, Table 5 has been prepared in terms of duration and year of marriage instead of minister's age and year of birth-
The earliest cohorts shown in Table 5, i.e. those married in 1900-19, can be followed to the 30th year of marriage. Duration of marriage has, in this study, been computed from the year of first marriage. Many of the children reported as born in the third decade of marriage appear to be products of second or later marriages.
The picture of the earlier cohorts, in this case, marriage cohorts, is again one of declining fertility. The number of children ever born per 100 ministers ever married, prior to the 20th year of marriage, dropped from 368 in the 1900-04 cohort to 233 in the 1930 cohort, a reduction of 37 per cent.

is almost twice that observed between the birth cohorts of 1870-79 and 1905, although the interval is shorter by five years. The steeper decline is the result of selection by mortality which has affected the earlier marriage cohorts. Of men who had been married at an early age at the beginning of the 20th century, a much larger proportion was still alive at the time of the survey, than of those who had entered marriage at the same time but at more advanced ages. Since persons who marry young tend to produce more children than those who marry comparatively late in life,

Since the number of children born in the third decade of marriage or later will be approximately balanced by the effect of the small amount of permanent celibacy that is to be expected, a total of about 270 children per minister may be thought of as applicable to the birth cohort of 1915, roughly corresponding to the marriage cohort of 1940, and 280 children to the birth cohort of 1920. The latter figure would correspond to the actual performance of the cohort of 1885-89 (Table 2) and would exceed the expected total of the 1905 cohort, 245 children, by less than 15 per cent.

selection by mortality increases the apparent fertility of the early marriage cohorts to a significant extent. The effect of mortality on the more recent marriage cohorts is negligible.
The low point of marital fertility is represented by the cohort of 1930, although

While adequate statistics are not available that would permit cohort analysis of male fertility for the population of the United States--or for the white population --it is possible to compare the Congregational ministers with a large sample of college graduates who had responded to mail

questionnaires of the Population Reference Bureau. A total of 38,123 male graduates of 1921-28 were canvassed during 1946-53, i.e. 25 years after the graduation of each class. Assuming an average at graduation of 23 years, these graduates may be roughly equated to the birth cohorts of 1898-1905. At an average age of 48 years, these men had produced 182 children2 per 100 graduates. The corresponding estimate for the ministers, based on Table 2, is on the order of 240 children per 100 ministers.
It remains to be determined to what extent successive birth cohorts of ministers have produced and are producing sufficient offspring to assure their own biologic replacement. If all the ministers' children could expect to reach adult age, each 100 ministers would be adequately replaced by 100 sons. Since, on the average, about 95 girls are born along with 100 boys, 195 children of both sexes would be required. This theoretical minimum value must be increased by an appropriate allowance for mortality prior to the age of reproduction. Since the interval between two male generations is approximately 30 years, the number of children required for replacement can be conveniently estimated by multiplying the theoretical minimum (195 per 100 ministers) with 100,000 I30--130 being the number of survivors to age 30 in a generation life table that has its origin 30 years after the birth of the parent generation. A series of generation life tables for United States white males, with origins from 1905 to 1945, were computed from

official life tables from 1909-11 to 1950, supplemented by Dorn's3 estimates for 1960 and 1970. The replacement values thus estimated are compared in Table 6 with the numbers of children actually produced by, or expected for, the corresponding birth cohorts of ministers. It is evident that throughout the period covered by this study fertility has been in excess of the level required for replacement.
In summary, then, the Congregational Ministers' Eugenic Survey has provided data on the reproductive performance of a well-defined social group. These data show a steep increase in total male fertility rates in recent years which appears confirmed by birth cohort analysis. Further study, in terms of marriage cohorts, reveals that the apparent increase in fertility has, in the main, resulted from earlier marriages than heretofore. So far as can be ascertained, the average size of family has increased only moderately. By inference the survey contributes to a better understanding of the current trend of the birth rate.
