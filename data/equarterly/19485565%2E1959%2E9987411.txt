MARRIAGE AND FERTILITY PATTERNS OF COLLEGE GRADUATES*
PATIENCE LAURIAT
Bureau of the Census

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:25 08 December 2015

JL OR ELEVEN YEARS the Population Reference Bureau undertook annual surveys of college graduates of 10-year and 25year standing. These surveys, conducted from 1946 through 1956, were designed to measure trends in the fertility of college-educated persons. The graduates of 25 years previous would have virtually completed their families, whereas the graduates of only 10 years standing would be about midway through their most fertile years.
STUDY PROCEDURES
The universe from which the sample was drawn consisted of all the colleges with a reported enrollment of 500 or more students as listed in the Education Directory published annually by the U.S. Office of Education. It was a selfselected sample in that it consisted of all the colleges which indicated their willingness to cooperate. Each fall, letters were sent to the listed colleges--to the sociology departments, alumni offices, or presidents--requesting their participation in the Study for that year.
A mail questionnaire was deemed to be the most effective and practical method of contacting the graduates to be studied--those that had graduated 10 and 25 years previous from the colleges which had indicated they wished to co-

operate. Because of the limited office personnel and financial resources of the Study, the mailing of the questionnaires was to be done by the colleges in conjunction with their own mailings of literature to their 10-year and 25-year graduates. The brief post-card questionnaire included questions on the year of graduation, whether or not the graduate had ever been married and, if so, the number of children he (or she) had ever had. The 1955 and 1956 questionnaires were expanded to include, for evermarried graduates, the (calendar) year of marriage and the (calendar) year of birth of each child up to the fifth. The colleges tallied the results and returned the report forms to the Study office.
On the average, almost 145 colleges participated each year in the College Study. The highest participation occurred in 1950 and 1951 when about 200 colleges and universities cooperated. For five other years, the number of colleges ranged between 159 and 179. The participation was lowest for the first three years of the Study and the last year, when less than 100 colleges in each year cooperated.
The reasons for these fluctuations in the number of participating colleges are not specifically known. It is probable, however, that whether or not a college participated depended largely upon the workload and staff availability of the college alumni office or sociology depart-

ment when the requesting letter was received. Also, for some colleges, the decision regarding participation may have been influenced by the emphasis which the Study placed on the eugenic implications of the fertility of college graduates. In any event, a study was undertaken of the influence, if any, of the variable participation of colleges on the data. No large differences were observed between the data for the group of colleges which had participated in the Study for most of the survey years and the total colleges in any given year. Thus it appears that any bias resulting from the changing participation of colleges from year to year has little significance.
As the coverage of colleges varied considerably from year to year, so also did the number of responding graduates. Survey year 1950 had the largest number of participating colleges and graduates available to the Study--those with known address--almost 50,000 (Table 1). The year following the inception of the Study, 1947, shows the lowest number of colleges and graduates. Between 1948 and 1954, the number of graduates available to the Study each year exceeded 30,000.
The response rate has been over 50 per cent for every year, reaching a peak in 1954 and 1955 when 75 per cent of the graduates returned the questionnaires. The lowest response rate, 59 per cent, occurred in the 1956 survey, when the number of participating colleges and graduates available to the survey were also low. Discussing this, the Bureau points out that the low response rate and the small number of colleges were probably attributable to four factors: (1) Some revisions in procedures, (2) delays incident to the reorganization of the Study which may have caused some of the colleges not to follow up the initial

mailing as thoroughly as before, (3) war service which greatly reduced the number of male graduates in the class of 1946, and (4) a change in the questionnaire which some colleges interpreted so rigidly that questionnaires were sent only to graduates with a B.A. degree.
MAJOR FINDINGS
Table 1 summarizes the major findings of the 11 surveys which were conducted. The data reveal two important trends: (1) For both the older and younger graduates, male fertility was consistently higher than female fertility; (2) the younger women, 10 years after graduation, had already had a higher average number of children than the older women, 25 years after graduation. This latter trend first started to become evident in 1951 among all graduate women. By 1956, the difference between the older and younger women graduates was 15 children per 100 graduates.
Increases in fertility occurred among all four groups of graduates during the period the College Study was conducted. The increase among male graduates was greater than that among female graduates for both the younger and the older groups. However, for both sexes, the fertility of the younger graduates increased more than that of the older. The older men reported an increase of 34 children per 100 graduates, whereas the older women reported an increase of only 12 children per 100 graduates. Among the younger men, the number rose from 102 children per 100 graduates to 190, an increase of 88 children per 100 graduates, and the women reported an increase of 75 children per 100 graduates, from 95 per 100 in 1946 to 170 in the 1956 survey. Increases in marital fertility were of just about the same magnitude.

The proportions married among the various groups of graduates remained virtually constant during the 11 years the Study was conducted, except among women in the 1956 survey. Among the older men, the proportion ever married varied by only 4 percentage points, between 92 per cent for the graduates of 1922 and 96 per cent for the graduates of 1924. There was somewhat greater variation among the younger men in that the graduates of 1937 reported 83 per cent ever married and the graduates of 1939 reported 91 per cent ever married.
For women, on the other hand, the proportion married ranged between 71 and 80 per cent for the older graduates and between 73 and 77 per cent for the younger graduates. In 1956, both groups reported much higher proportions married--82 and 85 per cent, respectively. These higher proportions are probably due in large part to a procedural change in the Study inaugurated in 1956. Prior to that year, questionnaires had been mailed to all the men graduates but only to married women graduates; i.e., those designated as "Mrs." on the alumnae records. In 1956, questionnaires were sent to all women graduates with known address. This change was made for two reasons: (1) Some of the women shown as "Miss" on the alumnae records had probably actually married but had neglected to advise the alumnae office, whereas others may have been married, subsequently divorced, and had resumed their maiden names; (2) to make the procedures for men and women similar so that the results for the two sexes would be more comparable. That the procedural change produced the expected result--higher proportions married among the women and, therefore, a lessening of the differential between male and female fertility--is shown by

the greater increase for women than men in the proportion reported as married and a reduction in the difference between the number of children per 100 male and female graduates between the 1955 and 1956 surveys. However, the relative size of the change in fertility between the 1955 and 1956 surveys is practically the same for the colleges cooperating in either year as for the smaller number which cooperated in both years.
EVALUATION OF THE STUDY
The College Study data suffer from various inadequacies. The major one is that the sample upon which they are based is not a probability sample so that a direct measure of error or sampling variability cannot be obtained. Secondly, the fact that it was a mail survey is also, to some extent, disadvantageous because only those graduates with known address were available to the Study. Follow-up of nonrespondents was not attempted. A recent study of college graduates in England, which included some follow-up of nonrespondents, shows that the people who do not respond are less often married, more often childless, and less well-off economically.1 Furthermore, information on various significantly related social and demographic characteristics of the graduates, such as exact age, present marital status, occupation, income, etc., are not available.
It has long been suspected that response to the questionnaire has been related to parenthood, that is, that parents are more likely to return the questionnaire than are childless married graduates and unmarried graduates. A comparison of Census data for college graduates of similar age groups suggests that

such a bias is inherent in the College Study. However, the College Study data have shown the same general trends in proportions married and children ever born that available Census or national survey data have shown. Furthermore, there is no reason to assume that, to the extent that bias does exist, it would differ from year to year. Therefore, the data are believed to be reasonably reliable and to be comparable between years.
The data presented in Tables 2 to 4 on date of marriage and dates of birth are based on a subsample of the 1955 survey. In 1955, 70 colleges returned 9,343 original questionnaires to the Study office for further analysis. Although only two-fifths of the participating colleges returned the questionnaires, the questionnaires represent about one-half of all the available graduates. However, it must be pointed out that this subsample has inherent in it any biases of the larger sample.
The 1955 survey data relate to the graduates of 1930 and 1945. These groups are of particular interest. The class of 1930 graduated just as the country was entering the Depression years of the 1930's, whereas the class of 1945 graduated as the country was entering a period of prosperity following World War II. Because social and economic conditions differed during the years immediately succeeding the graduation of these classes, and since the fertility of the group as a whole is controlled, differences between these two specific graduating classes are to be expected. However, it is interesting to note that probbably most of the men who graduated in 1945 were those who had been rejected for physical unfitness by the Army during the war years. It is regrettable that data for a more "normal" group are

175

not also available for purposes of comparison.
The analysis to be presented here is limited to the experience of the graduates of 1930 and 1945 during the ten years immediately succeeding their graduation from college. Direct comparisons of the total fertility of the two graduate groups cannot be made at this time since the graduates of 1945 still had at least 10 to 15 years of reproductive capacity before them when they were surveyed in 1955. On the other hand, the graduates of 1930 had virtually completed their fertility by the time of the survey.

rates for the ten years immediately following graduation for the graduates of 1930 and 1945 by sex. Although the questionnaire did not specifically ask for date of first marriage, as opposed to current marriage, the question read, "Have you ever married?" If yes, a space was provided for insertion of the date. Thus, it was assumed that in most cases the date of marriage obtained relates to first marriage. This assumption is further substantiated in that no graduates reporting on children reported the date

176 Eugenics Quarterly

of birth of the first child as preceding the reported date of marriage.
The important trend that the marriage data show is that during the period 19301939, for both men and women, the older graduates married at a slower rate than the younger graduates during the comparable period 1945-1954. The difference for women, however, was more than twice that for men--171 first marriages per 1,000 women during the 10year period compared to only 73 per 1,000 men. This differential increase for women was great enough to reverse the differential marriage rate of men and women: Among older graduates, the men experienced a higher marriage rate during the 10 years following graduation than the women, whereas among the younger graduates, the women had married faster during the comparable 10year period than the men. The differential increase in marriage rates among the women probably also accounts for the reversal of the proportion remaining single within 10 years after graduation: Among the older graduates, 27 per cent of the women had never married by 1940 compared to only 20 per cent for the men, whereas the differential among the younger graduates was considerably less and in favor of the women--10 per cent compared to 13 per cent for the men.
For each year, with only two exceptions for the men, the annual first marriage rates were higher for the younger than the older graduates. The greatest differences occurred among the women, between those marrying in 1931 and those in 1946, and those marrying in 1932 compared to 1947. The low rates during 1931-1932 compared to the high rates of 1946-1947 probably reflect the differing economic conditions: 1931 and 1932 were depression years; 1946 and 1947 were post World War II prosperity

years. A comparison of the marriage rates
for the two sexes yields interesting results. For the older graduates, although the women experienced slightly higher first marriage rates during the years immediately after graduation, by 1934 the rates for women had become appreciably lower than those for the men. For younger graduates, higher female first marriage rates extended for a longer period of time after graduation, up through 1950. Thus, in both graduate groups, women married at a younger age than men, but the differential is greater among the younger than the older graduates.
ANNUAL BIRTH RATES
Table 3 presents annual birth rates for the four groups of graduates under consideration and birth rates for total native white women in the United States in the appropriate birth cohorts based on Whelpton's cumulative birth rates. The table relates only to births which occurred during the period 1930 to 1939 for the older graduates and women of the 1908-1909 cohorts and those between 1945 and 1954 for the younger graduates and women of the 1923-1924 birth cohorts. Births to total women prior to the periods under study were excluded from the calculations. An adjustment was indicated, but not made, to correct the rates for births prior to 1930 for the cohorts of 1908-1909 and for the births prior to 1945 for the 1923-1924 cohorts. The influence of these early births on the total rates presented here is believed to be negligible.
The most striking feature of Table 3 is the difference between the older and younger graduate groups compared to the older and younger cohorts of total women. For the older group, the birth rates for both men and women graduates

continued generally to rise throughout the period 1930-1939. The annual birth rate for total women, on the other hand, starting from a much higher level, declined during the period and was lower than that for both sexes of graduates during the latter part of the 1930's (1937 to 1939).
Among the younger group, fertility increased for both the graduate groups and for total women. Moreover, the birth rate for all women reached a peak in 1947, -whereas the birth rates for the graduate groups did not reach their peaks until 1952. For the younger group, also, the birth rate of total women was lower than that of the graduate groups during the latter part of the period, from 1950 to 1954. Thus, during the early years after graduation, the college graduates have their children at a slower rate, but they tend, to some extent, to "catch up" during the later years. This probably, in large part, reflects later age at marriage for college graduates than for all persons.
Table 4 presents parity-specific birth rates for the graduate groups being discussed. In calculating these rates, the

population "at risk" in any given year included those persons who had already experienced the immediately preceding event that same year. For example, women married in 1946 were included in the 1946 population "at risk" of a first birth although they may have married so late in that year that it would have been impossible for them to have a first birth during 1946. This was done because the data related only to year of marriage and year of birth, not to month and year of the event.
With few exceptions, the ever-married graduates of 1945 had higher parityspecific rates in each year after graduation than the ever-married graduates of 1930. An interesting exception occurs, however, which may indicate a real difference between the two groups in spacing patterns. First births to zero-parity ever-married men eight and nine years after graduation were higher for the 1930 graduates than for the 1945 graduates. The 1938 rate for the older ever-married men was 208 first births per 1,000 zeroparity graduates. The 1939 rate was 216. For the 1945 ever-married male graduates, on the other hand, the comparable

rates for 1953 and 1954 were 142 and 116 first births per 1,000 zero-parity graduates, respectively. This phenomenon characterizing the older men may reflect the fact that a significant proportion of them waited an exceptionally long time before starting their families. There is no such pattern among the females. Their zero-parity birth rates per evermarried graduate were consistently higher for the younger than the older women for the entire period.
Thus the data show that at least part of the higher fertility of the younger graduates is due to more graduates marrying and having a first child within ten years after graduation. A comparison of the first and second parity birth rates indicates that the higher fertility of the younger groups is also due to higher proportions of first-parity and secondparity graduates going on to have second

and third births. This may reflect a real increase in the size of completed families of college graduates. However, all that can be said at this time is that, within ten years after graduation, the graduates of 1945 had had more children than the graduates of 1930.
CONCLUSIONS
In the previous discussion of the limitations of these data it was stated that the sample from which they were obtained was not a probability sample and that, therefore, sampling variability could not be measured. However, the Mann-Whitney U Test, a nonparametric measure, had been used to test whether or not differences between the two graduate groups, males and females separately, are statistically significant. The tests indicate that the older and younger graduate groups differ significantly in

respect to marriage and childbearing. However, the amount of the bias in
the sample cannot be measured. As stated earlier, it appears likely that the graduates who responded to the College Study surveys were more married and had higher fertility than all graduates. Also, graduates of the cooperating colleges may have had larger families than the graduates of other colleges, especially the many colleges enrolling less than 500 students.2
With these limitations in mind, the data presented here have shown that the

1945 graduates, within ten years after graduation, had experienced higher marriage and fertility rates than the 1930 graduates during the comparable time period. Many factors, some known and some unknown, brought about the changes. However, given the 1930 depression and World War II prosperity, under conditions of, essentially, controlled fertility, the differences are those which are expected, based on other studies in the field. The extent to which social and psychological factors affected the marriage and fertility patterns of these graduates remain a matter of conjecture.
