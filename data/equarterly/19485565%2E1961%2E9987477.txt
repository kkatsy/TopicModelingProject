PENILE CARCINOMA AMONG JEWS

EMMANUEL MARGOLIS
Hadassah University Hospital Jerusalem, Israel

n.CSTIMATES OF THE incidence of-penile carcinoma in Great Britain, Western Europe and the United States range from 1% to 5% of all cancers in males (Bleich, 1950; Paul, 1957). Sanjurjo and Gonzalez (1960) found an even lower frequency in Puerto Rico. Sporadic reports from institutions of Asia indicate that the percentage of patients with cancer of the penis is much higher in that area, namely 21.9% in India, 18.3% in China, and 18.9% in other Far Eastern countries (Ngai, 1933).
It is maintained that cancer of the penis occurs relatively frequently in Negroes (Schrek and Lenowitz, 1947). Lenowitz and Graham (1946) found that in the United States cancer of the penis was fivetimes more common in Negroes than in whites.
The occurrence of carcinoma of the penis in Jews and persons who perform circumcision after birth is so exceedingly rare that isolated cases are widely quoted in the literature (Bleich, 1950; Dean, 1936; Reitman, 1953; Marshall, 1953; Paquin and Pearce, 1955; Amelar, 1956; Ledlie and Smithers, 1956).
Cancer of the penis occurs more often among Moslems, who circumcise their males at a later date, usually between 6 and 14 years, than among Jews, who perform circumcision on the eighth day

after birth. This might indicate that the precancerous changes can become well established at an early age and may progress to definite carcinoma formation even when the preputium has been removed comparatively early in life (Dean, 1935).
The fact that carcinoma of the penis occurs relatively frequently in Negroes, is infrequent in white non-Jewish men, and is practically unknown in Jews raises the question of racial susceptibility and immunity.
Is this distribution really due to inherited racial characteristics or is it dependent on environmental factors? According to Sorsby (1931) the immunity of the Jews should be attributed to circumcision and not to racial factors.
In a comprehensive study on the etiologic factors in carcinoma of the penis, Schrek and Lenowitz (1947) obtained positive correlations for the factors carcinoma of the penis, syphilis, gonorrhea, and the colored race. The authors believe the common denominator in these four factors to be poor sex hygiene. According to them, circumcision possibly lessens the accumulations of smegma and dirt, and in this way inhibits cancer.
Omitting the still inconclusive studies on the carcinogenic (Plaut and KohnSpeyer, 1947) or carcinostimulatory

(Pratt-Thomas and Heins, 1956) effects of the human smegma, we nevertheless feel that the hypothesis proposed by Schrek and Lenowitz (1947) is far from being indubitable. If this hypothesis were correct, one would expect circumcision during boyhood to also protect against cancer of the penis; and then it might be reasonable to present once more the question proposed by the Editors of Lancet (1932) 28 years ago, namely: If cancer of the penis might be prevented by the hygiene of circumcision, it is thus demonstrated that cancer is a preventable disease, and if it can be prevented in one organ by appropriate hygienic care, why can it not be prevented in other organs by similar hygienic measures appropriate to those respective organs?
Schrek and Lenowitz (1947) are aware of this. They therefore admit that the "individuals circumcised early in life are protected against cancer of the penis not by cleanliness but by some other process, the nature of which is not known."
The causes of penile cancer, being a part of the fundamental problem of cancer etiology, are still obscure. It seems therefore justifiable to concentrate our efforts on a thorough evaluation of the different characteristics and peculiarities of the patient and the possible causative factors. The correct answer might be detected in the interaction between them.
The possibility of racial susceptibility, or at least of racial predisposition, deserves due consideration. It is of interest, for example, that in the Hottentots a rather tight and elongated prepuce appears to be a racial characteristic; at the same time it was found that epithelioma of the penis is the commonest malignant tumor in male Hottentots (Hellman, 1955).

Up to the present time the evidence of circumcision as an effective measure against penile cancer is based upon negative rather than positive findings.
Positive data of confirmative value could be added if the cases of noncircumcised Jews developing penile carcinoma were collected and studied. If such a study then showed that, on the one hand, the incidence of cancer of the penis among noncircumcised Jews and noncircumcised Gentiles was the same and that, on the other hand, so was the incidence among circumcised Jews and circumcised Gentiles, it would then be possible to evaluate with certainty the protective importance of circumcision early in life.
However, cases of noncircumcised Jews are very rare, circumcision being a universal practice, a part of the religious rite of the Jews. Wollbarst1 did report finding one noncircumcised Jew with penile cancer. In the Tumour and Radium Institute of the Rothschild Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem, Israel, only one case of penile carcinoma in a noncircumcised Jew has so far been recorded. Recently, two instances have been reported {Cancer Bulletin, 1958) of carcinoma in Gentile patients circumcised in infancy. In both cases, an injury seemed to be an apparent factor in the etiology.
It might be helpful if contact could be established with physicians in the U.S.S.R. in order to obtain more authoritative information concerning the incidence of penile carcinoma among the Jews of Russia, who, since the Revolution, probably have not circumcised their newborns.
It will be of utmost interest to collect and study such cases. This data when analyzed might become a valuable contribution to the problem of penile cancer and the etiology of cancer in general.
