Introduction
F> ERHAPs ONE OFTHE most striking demographic phenomena in the world today is the use of induced abortion as a technique of family planning by over a million Japanese women annually. This situation is of special interest to the demographer and to the medical man because of the large amount of detailed research conducted by Japanese scholars. Seldom, if ever, has it been possible to obtain so comprehensive a view of abortion in a given society.
In this article, an attempt has been made to present, in summary form, the reasons for, characteristics of, and implications of the widespread use of abortion in postwar Japan. Also, a rather complete listing has been made of material readily available in English, in the hope that it may stimulate and aid further research on the topic.
Historical Background It would seem that consciously exercised
fertility control has been a feature of Japanese civilization since very early times. Down through the years, abortion, infanticide and contraception have been used in varying degrees by large segments of the population.
The first known use of abortion in Japan dates from approximately 700 A.D. Shortly before the start of the Tokugawa Shogunate (1603-1867), definite traces of abortion and infanticide can be found. During these early times, their incidence seems to have been sporadic and localized, related as it was to such natural calamities as plagues, floods, droughts and famines, which occasioned temporary population-resource problems. By the mid-eighteenth century, however, these practices had become widespread and permanent, so much so that in 1767

the shogunate deemed it necessary to issue an official edict prohibiting both abortion and infanticide.1
The adverse economic conditions in which a majority of the Japanese lived generally are considered to have occasioned the use of such drastic means of fertility control. Over and above the natural difficulties of subsistence, the people were burdened with a stringent system of taxation prevalent in feudal Japan. Significantly, the word mabiki, used to signify infanticide, has as its original meaning the thinning out of excess plants in a rice paddy. Thus, the Japanese "thinned out" some children in excess of the means of subsistence.
During the Meiji Restoration Period (1868-1912), a number of factors helped bring about a decline in the amount of abortion and infanticide. Among these were industrialization, higher standards of living, the influence of Western culture and again, official government opposition. The Restoration government, like its Tokugawa predecessor, took both positive and negative measures to remedy the situation. Especially important were its efforts to create a cultural milieu wherein large numbers of offspring would be considered desirable.2
This is not to say that abortion and infanticide disappeared completely. Haruo Mizushima, arguing from fertility trends of the latter half of the nineteenth century, and from present-day sex ratios of terminal births to women in the upper child-bearing

ages, concludes that these practices continued not only during the Meiji period, but even down to the present.3
The urban-rural fertility differential for Japan during the years 1880-1940 shows tendencies which cannot be explained except by postulating a large amount of fertility control in the rural areas. For, while the urban crude birth rates declined during this period, the rural rates showed a steady increase. Some of the increase can be accounted for by steadily improving birth registration among rural inhabitants, but by no means all of it. Mizushima concludes that infanticide must have been more prevalent in rural districts during earlier times, and that this practice gradually subsided allowing for an increase in the crude birth rates. It would seem just as reasonable to conclude that abortion also was widespread during the period.
Examining sex ratios of terminal births to women in the upper child-bearing ages for the years 1947-49, Mizushima finds that the sex ratio is positively correlated to the age of the mother and family size, and that the ratio is in general abnormally high. The only reasonable explanation would seem to be that some Japanese couples were expressing their traditional preference for male offspring by the intentional elimination of female children after birth.
After 1920, Japanese fertility began to decline steadily. The relative importance of various factors in this decline can only be surmised, however. Statistics on the production and diffusion of contraceptives, although incomplete, would seem to indicate the limited role played by this method of control.4 Official stillbirth rates for the years 1920-40, unusually high as they were, suggest the continued use of abortion. And, as has been seen, infanticide was not aban-

'doned entirely.5 Other factors which deserve consideration were the postponement of marriage and the shortage of men due to military or industrial service.
With the rise of militarism in Japan, official policy was geared to the building up of a large and healthy population, a sort of "super race." The National Eugenic Law of 1940, a concrete expression of this pronatalist policy, condemned abortion and infanticide except in cases where they were used with the express purpose of preventing the birth of defective offspring. Also, the reported production and sale of contraceptives for civilian use dropped sharply during this period.
Thus, direct evidence and analysis of official vital statistics indicate that abortion, contraception and infanticide were in use as means of family limitation in the years

prior to World War II. Unfortunately, the total amount of such limitation in the Japanese population, and the relative importance of each method employed, cannot be measured with accuracy.
This historical background is essential to an understanding of the present situation in Japan, since it illustrates that the use of abortion by the Japanese is not something only recently added to their culture, but that it has been a permanent feature of long standing.
Cultural Background
Analysis of the situation in postwar Japan is rendered particularly difficult by the presence there of attitudes and values hard for the average Westerner to understand.
When the Japanese speak of abortion as being "immoral," they do not necessarily include in that term all aspects usually taken into consideration by Americans. Neither Shinto nor Buddhism, the two largest religious creeds in Japan, categorically oppose abortion. And Shinto does not even recognize the child as a living person until it has "seen the light of day." Thus, the abhorrence of abortion based on the idea that it is in reality murder (and hence gravely sinful) is generally less strong among non-Westernized Japanese than among many other peoples.6
As a result, the Japanese tend to make a lesser distinction between abortion and other means of family limitation than do Westerners generally. They are not so likely to exclude instinctively and categorically the former as an acceptable means of family planning.
This attitude has been strengthened by language used in literature circulated throughout Japan. In some advertisements for chemical contraceptive products and in
6Even those aspects of Shinto and Buddhism which might tend toward moderation in this matter have little influence on personal behavior. Many of the Japanese religious adherents are so for traditional reasons, and place little importance on religion in their daily lives. For a further discussion of Japanese ideas on the morality of abortion, see below.

some family-planning advertisements in mass-circulation women's magazines, the character meaning "birth limitation" conveys the idea of "abortion" and/or "contraception." This leads to misunderstandings. In a 1950 public opinion poll, it was found that over 90 per cent of the women interviewed had at best only a vague notion as to the difference between the character for "contraception" specifically and that for "birth limitation" in general. Almost 50 per cent simply did not know there was a difference.7
Against this background, the passage of the Eugenics Protection Law, the official designation and special training of physicians to perform the operations, the controversy over family planning in the press, and the widespread advertising of chemical contraceptives contributed greatly toward a rather extensive acceptance of induced abortion as a means of family planning.
A survey conducted by the Mainichi newspaper is often cited to indicate the general attitude of Japanese toward abortion. Of those interviewed 38.6 per cent approved abortion in cases of financial distress; 18 per cent in cases where contraception had failed. The percentage of approval was higher where medical or eugenic indications were cited. On the other hand, opposition to the practice of abortion was voiced by 8.2 per cent for fear of moral degradation, and by only 2.9 per cent for religious reasons.8
There are signs that the reluctance among Japanese women to have an abortion may be diminishing. One indication of this is seen in the fact that the month of pregnancy during which the operation is most frequently performed has gradually become earlier.
Still one should not conclude that Japanese women are resorting to abortion glad-

ly or without remorse. The fact is that they consider delivery the natural course and regard abortion and contraception as unnatural. In many cases, however, harsh economic conditions have proven stronger than natural inclinations and desires.
An indication of the women's attitudes, cited by Dr. Koya, is the fact that many of them were found to have concealed their true identity during their investigation by government commissions assigned to review abortion cases. He interprets this as a sign of the reluctance and shame with which Japanese women are resorting to abortion.9
Postwar Economic Problems
In the years immediately following World War II, Japan entered a period of economic crisis. As a result of the war and subsequent settlements, she found her economy severely disrupted, and the rebuilding of it greatly hampered.
Geographically, she had lost 44 per cent of her prewar empire, including the highly industrialized area of Manchuria. Restrictions placed on the fishing area available to her caused a decline in output of this essential foodstuff, a staple in the Japanese diet. The resentments and ill will remaining from wartime conflict stood in the way of her establishing satisfactory trade relations with many nations of the world, especially her Asian neighbors and trading partners. In short, Japan's economic position simply was precarious for a number of years immediately following the close of World War II. Even today, it is far from satisfactory.
Population Increase
Intensifying an already serious economic problem were rounds of unprecedented population growth that Japan was experiencing. The repatriation of civilian and

approximately 6 million people into Japan proper. During this same period, the country went through the usual postwar "baby boom." Crude birth rates climbed to 34.3 per 1,000 in 1947and 33.5per 1,000 in1948, almost equalling the highest recorded rate in the nation's history of 35.0 per 1,000 in 1920-24.
Simultaneously factors were at work which caused an abrupt drop in the crude death rate. The hardships incurred by the civilian population during the war years had the result of eliminating many older and weaker persons. Thus, not a few died during that time who normally would have lived a few more years, and whose deaths would have been reflected statistically in

the death rates for the years after the war. Even more important were the medical and public health measures introduced by the occupation authorities, which contributed significantly toward raising the general health level of the Japanese people. Insecticides, pesticides and miracle drugs found their way into Japan in large quantities. As a result, in 1947 the crude death rate reached an all time low of 12.0 per 1,000 persons.
The rate of natural increase, whose previous high had been in the order of 15.0 per 1,000 climbed to 19.7 in 1947 and to 21.5 in 1948. The rate of population growth for the five-year period 1945-50 was 16.5 per cent as compared with 7.5 per cent for 1935-40 and 8.5 per cent for 1925-30.
This high rate of population growth might well have been absorbed by a nation with room to expand or with a healthy industrial economy. As it happened, Japan had neither, and soon found herself faced with a rather acute population-resources problem.
The Eugenic Protection Law
Concern over the effects that poor economic conditions were having on the health and welfare of the mothers of Japan led to the passage, in July 1948, of the Eugenic Protection Law. The widespread backing given to this law is indicated by the fact that, among the nine legislators introducing it, all five major political parties were represented. After its original passage, it was revised on several occasions.
As amended in May 1949, the law included the following provisions which, generally speaking, were designed to prevent the increase of inferior descendants and to "protect the life and health of the mother 'as well."10
First, the law legalized sterilization in cases where defective offspring might result,
10For the provisions of the Eugenic Protection Law, cf. Taeuber and Balfour, op. cit., p. 116, and for more detail, "The New Eugenic Protection Law in Japan," Eugenical News, XXXIII (March-June, 1948), 21-23.

or where the life or health of the mother might be endangered by delivery or pregnancy. The sterilization operation could be voluntary or, in some cases, could be ordered by state authorities.
Second, "Eugenic Protection Consultation Offices" were erected to provide advice and information on matters of marriage, eugenics and family limitation by means of contraception.
The third provision, and that which concerns us here, relates to abortion, or "artificial interruption of pregnancy" as it is called in Japan.
The original law, as of July, 1948, named reasons of eugenics or of health of the mother as sufficient to justify an abortion.11 It was stated that in case a physician (approved by the Japanese Medical Association) found it "necessary" to perform an abortion for any of the reasons enumerated, he could "with the consent of the person in question and spouse" apply to a commission for authorization to do so.
A May 1952 amendment, however, made it unnecessary for the doctor to consult any authorities before performing an abortion. The matter was left entirely to his discretion.12
An abortion was also allowed if the woman had conceived under threat of violence, or if, in the case of a married woman, she had been forced into extramarital relations against her will.
In May 1949, a number of liberalizing amendments were passed. The most significant among them provided that financial or socio-economic conditions of the couple in question could be sufficient to justify an abortion. As will be seen later, the majority of reported abortions have been performed under this provision, rather than under those pertaining to eugenic or health considerations.
11A complete list of these indications is given in "The New Eugenic Protection Law in Japan," p. 21.
12Unfortunately, this amendment will render future research in the field more difficult inasmuch as statistical data will be less complete and less reliable.

It can be said that the Eugenic Protection Law is extremely permissive. Many would agree with the conclusion that "The general effect of the law would seem to be first, to permit legal sterilization or abortion in almost any case for almost any reason if the patient desired i t . . ,"13
SCAP and the Eugenic Protection Law
The question has been raised as to the role of SCAP in the passage and administration of the 1948law. Since opinions differ greatly and since evidence is somewhat scarce, it is rather hard to make any definitive statements on the subject. However, it would seem that American occupation officials, at least in their official capacity, did not try to prevent or promote the passage of the bill or the use of abortion. Considering the problem one to be handled by the Japanese themselves, American personnel generally adopted a policy of "hands off."14
13"The New Eugenic Protection Law in Japan," p. 23. A similar opinion was expressed by Dr. Minoru Muramatsu in some untitled remarks made before Meeting No. 8 of the World Population Conference, September 2, 1954.
14For conflicting points of view on this subject, cf. George P. Garlin, "America's Modest Proposal," Commonweal, LX (July 9, 1954), 339ff.; Patrick O'Connor, "Birth Control in Japan," a letter to the editor of the Tablet (London), XCIX (March 29, 1952), 254, and Fumiko Y. Amano, "Abortion in Japan: Significance of its Legalization," Planned Parenthood Quarterly of Japan, I (April-June, 1950), p. 26.

General Effects of the Law
It now seems that, even among those originally in favor of the Eugenic Protection Law, not a few have been disturbed by the drastic results it occasioned. Apparently, many of these at the time considered it a mere recognition and legalization of a fait accompli. They hoped to regulate abortion by government control until such time as it could be eliminated or minimized by widespread family planning or by alleviation of the poor economic conditions. By formal regulation, they thought, harmful effects associated with criminal, clandestine abortions would be overcome. And as the title implies, and the body of the law states explicitly, the use of abortion for purposes of health and eugenics was foremost in the minds of many. There is no evidence to indicate that more than a small minority considered a rise in the incidence of abortion in Japan a desirable thing.
Nevertheless, since passage of the law in 1948, the number of induced abortions has risen steadily and rapidly. In January, 1949, there were 6,400 such operations reported; the total for that year of 264,100 indicates the rapid rate of increase. Latest figures show that for 1953 the total of reported induced abortions was 1,068,066. Table 3 gives a statistical summary of the use of abortion in Japan for the years 194954. As is the case with all abortion statistics

146 Eugenics Quarterly

these are quite inadequate, since the number of unreported and criminal abortions is still quite large. Many consider the true total to be at least twice the reported figure.15
It is evident, then, that the Eugenic Protection Law, far from being a mere recognition of an existing situation, has, in combination with other factors given rise to an enormous increase in the incidence of induced abortion in Japan.
Reasons Cited for the Use of Abortion
From the various studies made of the situation recently, a number of interesting and significant facts have emerged. But, one stands out above all, namely, that women of Japan are using abortion as another means of family planning, and that eugenic and health considerations have not been foremost in their minds.
Although the law was designed to protect the life and health of the mother and to insure healthy offspring, the number having abortions for these reasons has been quite small. A study, conducted by Dr. Koya and his associates, of 1,382 cases among married women showed that only 17.1 per cent had had the operation for health reasons. Only six mentioned "eugenic" considerations as having influenced
15Although some of the increase reflected in statistical data is attributable to improved reporting, nevertheless it is safe to say the total number of induced abortions in Japan has actually risen. The Japan Institute of Public Health, in what it regards as rather conservative estimates, places the total number of reported and unreported induced abortions for the years 1952 and 1953 at possibly as high as 1,940,000 and 2,330,000 respectively. In this connection, cf. Minoru Muramatsu and Hiroshi Ogino, "Estimation of the Total Numbers of Induced Abortions as Well as of Sterilization Operations for Females in Japan for the Years 1952 and 1953," Bulletin of the Institute of Public Health, IV (Sept., 1954).
16Yoshio Koya et al., "Preliminary Report of a Survey of Health and Demographic Aspects of Induced Abortion in Japan," Archives of the Population Association of Japan, II (1953), pp. 6-7. In a separate analysis of the 37 women who were childless at the time of the operation, 24 cases (65 per cent) indicated reasons of health. These represent but a small part of the total sample, however, and in no way vitiate our conclusion.

their decision to have abortion. The reasons most frequently named were "mainly for spacing," "mainly for economic reasons" and "mainly do not want more children."16
Thus, over 80 per cent of the women in this group based their reasons for having an abortion on factors identical with those used to justify other methods of birth control, that is, financial need, child spacing and the desire to limit family size.
Joban Coal Mine Study
Similar conclusions can be drawn from a study made by Dr. Koya in the Joban coal mining area of the Fukushima prefecture.17 Beginning in February of 1953, miners and their wives were subjected to rather intensive guidance in family planning. The aim of research was to determine the most effective way in which lower income groups could be persuaded to utilize contraceptives. That particular segment of the population was chosen because it has always been characterized by high fertility, and because Dr. Koya felt that its problems seemed to typify those of the nation as a whole.
The method of guidance was as follows. Members of the National Institute of Public Health made periodic visits for a number of days at a time, giving lectures, showing movies, distributing literature and giving individual advice where possible. To carry on during the absence of Institute officials, a midwife was appointed in the area for the express purpose of continuing family planning guidance. Leaders from local women's clubs were also used for this work. Aside from technical advice given on fertility limitation methods, there was a constant effort to impress on the couples involved the "desirability" of effective family planning, and "how unfortunate it
17Yoshio Koya, M.D., Director, National Institute of Public Health, gives an account of this survey in "Present Situation of Family Planning among Farmers and Coal Mine Workers," a paper presented at the World Population Conference, Rome, September, 1954, and in "A Study of Family-planning of Coal-Miners," an unpublished paper prepared by Dr. Koya and staff.

would be . . . if couples have too many children."18
The results of this study (as well as earlier studies made by Dr. Koya and his staff19) would indicate that, following contraceptive guidance, induced abortion increased significantly. And, as Dr. Koya testifies, "the decrease in births appearing after a period of approximately one year . . . was largely caused by artificial abortions."20
The reason for this seems to be that although the women involved considered family planning desirable, they had not adopted the attitudes of the Institute of Public Health with regard to the various means of attaining this end. The Institute of Public Health favored contraception, but frowned on abortion as an unsuitable and harmful method; the people made no such clear-cut distinction. Their final choice in any individual case seems to have been based on purely personal motives, not on the advice of public health officials. In general, however, abortion and contraception probably were used as substitutes for one another. Thus, contraceptive failures were followed by abortion, and repeated abortions often lead to contraception, or in some cases sterilization.
Evidence at hand fails to indicate that moral or health considerations are having much influence on choice of method. Convenience seems to have played a major role. As Dr. Koya points out, ". . . thus they resort to surgical treatment unhesitatingly avoiding troublesome contraceptive practices."21

These describe a similar study made in a rural milieu. 20Koya, "A Study of Family-planning," pp. 10-11. Recent reports from the same areas indicate, however, that after two years the incidence of induced abortion showed a gradual decline. 21 Ibid., p. 12.

Differential Between Contraceptors and Non-contraceptors
In a national survey it was found that by and large those who resort to abortion are more often contraceptors than non-contraceptors. Looking at this same fact from two aspects it was seen that: (1) contraceptors have experienced abortion more than have non-contraceptors; (2) for the country as a whole, pregnancies resulting from contraceptive failure were terminated by abortion in at least 50 per cent of the cases.22
With regard to the first point, the statistics in more detail are as follows: of those couples classified as contraceptors, 31.5 per cent had experienced abortion; 53.8 per cent had not. In 14.7 per cent of the cases, the experience was not determined. Among non-contraceptors, only 4.8 per cent had experienced abortion; 83.2 per cent had not, while 12 per cent of the cases were not determined. From this it might be argued that abortion is approximately 6 times more frequent among contraceptors than among non-contraceptors.
Secondly, the above-mentioned survey determined the outcome of pregnancies resulting from contraceptive failures. For the country as a whole, 50.0 per cent of such pregnancies were terminated by induced abortion. For urban regions the figure was 56.3 per cent; for rural regions, 44.1 per cent.
Abortion and Family Size
From the studies Dr. Koya made of a small sample group of women who had experienced induced abortion, he concluded that the highest incidence of abortion in Japan today is found among women of the 30-40 age group and among women with 2 or 3 children.23 Related to this is the fact that high-order births have decreased significantly in recent years. An examination^

of the birth rates by order of birth for the years 1947 and 1951 shows that between these years the rate decreased substantially in every classification after the third birth. Moreover, the decrease was progressively larger with the higher order births.24
From these two facts, it can be concluded that many women are willing to have the second and even the third child, but after that point begin to limit the size of their families. To a large degree, this limitation has been accomplished by means of induced abortion.25
Cost of an Abortion Operation
In any attempt to explain the extensive use of abortion by the women of Japan, the cost of such an operation must be taken into consideration.
In the Joban coal mine survey, it was found that most of the women had the operation performed for as little as 700 yen (less than $2.00), by utilizing public and private health insurance programs available to much of organized labor in Japan. Moreover, in not a few cases, the employer had borne a substantial part of the cost.26 In another survey of a less homogeneous group, the average cost was found to have been approximately 2,200 yen ($6.10).27
Obviously, such extremely low charges for an abortion operation have had the effect of putting this means of fertility control within reach of all but the poorest families.
Abortion and Population Growth
There are those who consider abortion a quite acceptable answer to Japan's current population-resource problems. Others
241953 U.N. Demographic Yearbook. The appreciable decrease in first births is due partly to the abnormally high rates in 1947, partly to the fact that fertility control is spreading rapidly in Japan.
25Honda, op. cit., p. 9, estimates that the number of births prevented by contraception annually is but one-fourth the total prevented by all means. This estimate was based on the year 1952. Others estimate this percentage at 30 per cent and, attribute 70 per cent of birth prevention to induced abortion.
26Koya, "A Study of Family-planning," pp. 11-12. 27Koya et al., op. cit., p. 9.

look on it as a "necessary evil" at best. Most Japanese, however, have rejected it as a suitable solution in view of the many and grave difficulties involved. Some of these difficulties have been discussed below.
One of the most significant biological facts about abortion as a means of fertility limitation is the need for frequent repetitions. The resumption of the normal cyclical functions of the female seems to occur more quickly after an abortion than after a pregnancy carried to term. Generally speaking, re-conception is a distinct possibility within a shorter period of time than in the case of a normal delivery. Moreover, during lactation the possibility of conception is sometimes minimized. When these natural safeguards of the health of the mother and the child are rendered inoperative by an abortion, repeated pregnancies may well occur at rapid intervals.
Such has been the case in Japan. In Dr. Koya's survey of 1,382 women, it was found that 49.1 per cent were pregnant within two years after the operation. And, of the women pregnant again, 74.1 per cent had become so within one year. Almost half of this latter group resorted to a second abortion.28 If, then, abortion were to be an effective means of population control, it would have to be repeated quite frequently by a large segment of the female population.
Recent Population Trends
Latest population statistics from Japan indicate a large drop in the crude birth rate for the year 1954. From 34.3 per 1,000 in 1947, the rate has dropped to 19.4 in 1954, a decrease of 43.4 per cent. In this same period, the rate of natural increase has fallen from 19.7 to 11.6 per 1,000. In view of the abnormally high birth rates in early postwar years, this decline is to some degree natural, that is, a return to normality. But, deliberate fertility control has been an equally important, if not more important, factor. Tatsuo Honda, estimating

the relative importance of methods of birth control, concludes that ". . . of the total number of births prevented by various means, those prevented by contraception represent only one-fourth." He also is of the opinion that ". . . the recent decline of the birth rate is chiefly due to abortion."29
Projections made by the Population Research Institute of the Japanese Welfare Ministry indicate a continued lowering of the birth rate, and, after 1960, a rising death rate. In spite of present high levels of unemployment, there is some concern being voiced over the projected age structure of future Japanese populations, and the possibility of a shrinking (relatively speaking) labor force.30
Abortion and Health
Aside from the demographic effects of abortion, its influence has been seen in other areas.
Although the majority of induced abortion operations are performed by competent physicians under strict specified conditions, still, a considerable number of women report post-operative complications. In Dr. Koya's survey, an attempt was made to determine the extent of such harm. The re-

suits, however, must be interpreted in the light of certain limitations if a true picture is to be obtained, namely: (1) the information was gotten by means of personal interview, not by medical examination; (2) the interviews were conducted anywhere from 18 to 41 months after the operation, so that some difficulties may not have had time to become apparent, or some had disappeared and had been forgotten; (3) no account of phychic effects was taken.
In spite of these limitations, 47.3 per cent of the women reported some physical complaint. It may be significant, in view of what was said about need for repetition, that the rate of complications increased approximately 5 per cent with each succeeding operation.31
Abortion and Morality
When the Japanese refer to the "moral undesirability" or the "immorality" of abortion, they are not necessarily passing judgment on the intrinsic morality of the act. Rather, they often have in mind the extrinsic, harmful effects that the widespread use of abortion has on individuals and on society.

One such effect, at present causing concern among the Japanese, is the use of abortion to terminate pregnancies resulting from illicit sex relations. There are indications that such use is rather extensive.
If the incidence of abortion is related to all women by age group, and then to married women by age group, the differences observed can be explained only by the assumption that abortion is used extensively by the unmarried.32 Obviously, with one of the strongest deterrents to illicit sex relations removed, that is, the fear of detection, this type of behavior may well increase, especially among the youth of the country.
Some married couples are opposed to use of abortion on grounds that could be called "moral" in the sense explained above. The Mainichi public opinion poll previously mentioned, found that 8.2 per cent of the participants opposed abortion because of a "fear of moral degradation." This would seem to indicate that many Japanese couples consider as degrading the refusal to accept the parental responsibilities following on the use of marriage. Even amid harsh economic conditions, such couples apparently regard the use of sex exclusively for the sake of sex as somehow harmful to their character and to their moral worth.
32Taeuber and Balfour, op. cit., p. 217. To what extent abortion was so used by the unmarried before passage of the Eugenics Protection Law is rather hard to say in the absence of reliable statistics for that period.

Sterilization
Up to the present, the number of sterilization operations performed in accordance with provisions of the Eugenic Protection Law has been relatively small, when compared with the number of abortions.33 ;There are indications, however, that this form of fertility control may become much more prevalent in the near future.
In one of Dr. Koya's studies, the attitude of the women towards sterilization was determined. Of the 1,382 participants, 49.6 per cent did not want to be sterilized; 23.5 per cent either wanted the operation, or had already had it; 25.8 per cent were undecided; and approximately 1 per cent said that they had no need for the operation, for example, they were widowed or divorced.34 From this, it would seem that perhaps 50 per cent of the women now experiencing abortion operations might under certain conditions decide to undergo sterilization.
Some comments made by Dr. Minoru Muramatsu at the World Population Conference hint that, because of the injurious results of repeated induced abortions now

being observed, official and medical opinion may favor an increased use of sterilization as a remedy for the situation. His concluding remarks are especially interesting:
Consequently, I believe that the role which female sterilization plays in the general picture of family limitation in Japan will undoubtedly become more and more significant. . . We are watching with keen eyes what is happening in Puerto Rico and other parts of the world.35
Conclusion
Admittedly, the legalization of induced abortion in Japan has contributed substantially to a lowering of the birth rate, thereby easing somewhat the pressures upon immediately available resources. But if in this respect it has mitigated a difficult situation, it provides no lasting or sound answer to a basic economic problem. In view of its restricted area and very limited agricultural land, Japan needs assured sources of raw materials and foodstuffs as well as outlets for its manufactured products.
Moreover, some are beginning to speculate as to the dangers of declining labor force and aging population inherent in so large and sudden a cut in the birth rate. Also occasions of justifiable concern arethe injurious effects abortion seems to behaving on the health, morals and general welfare of the people, individually and collectively considered. In short, the Japanese experiment with legalized abortion has left unsolved some basic problems, while adding new ones in the form of personal and social disorganization.
Other nations faced with problems associated with limited resources and rapid population growth have been watching with interest the drastic reduction of the Japanese birth rate consequent to thelegalization of abortion for socio-economic indications. In view of this, it would seem to be of utmost importance that American students analyze the Japanese experience in all its
