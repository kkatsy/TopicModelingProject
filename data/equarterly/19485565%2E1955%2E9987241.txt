There to the divorce picture.1 is neither any prohibition against the col-

Now, for the first time in the United States, a vital statistics office has included a query as to religious preference on its registration forms for marriage and divorce. In spite of thegeneral newness of the forms (which included several modifications and an entirely new format) and without any coercion being exercised, both parties answered the question on "Religious Denomination" in 95 percent of all marriages (over 20,000) and in 87 per cent of all divorces (over 5,000) which took place in 1953 in Iowa. Denominational preference among Protestants was less adequately given: where both parties were Protestant,

Monahan, "Religious Preference and Inter-Religious Mixture in Marriages and Divorces in Iowa," American Journal of Sociology (publication forthcoming) . Additional bibliography will be found in: Thomas P. Monahan and William M. Kephart, "Divorce and Desertion by Religious and MixedReligious Groups," American Journal of Sociology LIX (March, 1954), pp. 454-465. The new forms asked for the "Religious Denomination" of both parties. Because the parties to the marriage so frequently declared an association with a church, in comparison to what one would expect from church membership figures, it seems that many persons declared their religious preference although they were not actually church members.

Religious Composition of the Population from Marriage Data
In the absence of population statistics, marriage data can give us a rough approximation of the religious composition in an area provided there is no important variation in the propensity to marry, the age at marriage, or the age distribution of the different denominations. Such a use of marriage data could be negated by a largenumber of interstate or migratory marriages, or by an unequal frequency of remarriage between the different denominations. A distribution by denominations of "first" marriages of resident brides tends to eliminate such remarriage and residence distortions, and this kind of modification of marriage statistics under ordinary circumstances should give us a fair measure of the re-

The Jewish group constituted 0.3 per cent in all classes, which is about the proportion reported in the American Jewish Yearbook for 1954, pp. 3-7.

ligious composition of a population.2 As shown in Table 1, migratory marriages and remarriages alter the denominational percentages, but not drastically in Iowa. Because of the tendency for Catholics to marry at the place of residence of the bride, by church regulation, and because of the lower divorce rate among Catholics and the ecclesiastical restriction on remarriages when divorce does occur, the Catholic marriages (according to the wife's religion) constitute a somewhat higher proportion of the marriages after refinement is made for residence and "first" marriage.
Migratory Marriages by Denomination
Surprisingly enough, brides in "first" marriages in several of the large denominations were more often residents of the state than were the Catholic brides. For all denominations the degree of nonresidence is higher for the remarried than for the "first" married, and generally higher for the divorced segment than for the widowed class. Divorced persons in all denominations swell migratory marriage.
Occupational Distribution of Marriages by Religious Denomination
Such information is of value in interpreting age-at-marriage variations, divorce differentials, and the like.3 Although it cannot be taken as a reliable index of conditions prevailing in the population as a whole, the occupational distribution of
2There is no reason to assume that the age distributions of the major denominations are importantly different, or that their marital propensity varies to any significant degree. A discussion of marriage age follows. "First" as used in this article refers to marriages (or divorces) in which both parties are being married (or divorced) for the first time. For the statistical similarity of the distributions of marriage and population records for denominations, see Dominion Bureau of Statistics, Ottawa, Canada, "Some Characteristics of Husbands and Wives as Indicated in the Census and Vital Statistics," Reference Papers, 1950, No. 10, pp. 14-17.

marriages is at least suggestive. Where both parties did not declare their religion, or gave it as "Protestant" or "None," we find below-average percentages in the farm group and overrepresentation in the semiskilled and labor-service occupations. The Baptists (about one-fourth of whom were Negroes) show a similar pattern. The Lutherans are strongly represented in the farming class, and the Presbyterians tend to concentrate in farming and white-collar occupations.
The occupational pattern offers very little

explanation for the favorable divorce position of the both-Catholic marriages compared to total marriages; and the relatively greater occurrence of divorce among mixedCatholic marriages as compared with bothCatholic marriages finds only a slight explanation in their different occupational configurations.
Median Age At First Marriage
A much larger number of cases would be required to control these data for occupation, the major factor influencing age at

marriage. The occupational aspect is clearly evident in the Jewish group (52 men and 42 women) with median ages of 26.2 for grooms and 21.6 for brides. Considering the major denominations only, the Catholics had the highest median ages, and the Christian Disciples the lowest. But, on the whole it is remarkable to find a variation of only a year or two between the different denominations in their median age at "first" marriage. Couples getting divorced had been married about a year earlier than the average for 1953 marriages, again with surprisingly little variation appearing between religious groupings of divorces.

Marriages by Religious Ceremony
Prior Marital Status. The marital history of the couple is significantly related to the type of ceremony chosen. Whereas only 81 per cent of all marriages in Iowa were performed by a clergyman, in the case of "first" marriages the figure was 88 per cent. Widowhood for either party brought a drop in the proportion by religious ceremony. A divorce experience effected a further decline, so that only about half of the marriages in which both parties had at some

Monthly Variation
In studies which utilize samples of marriage records, one must be alert to the effect of religious constraints upon marriage during holy seasons. Outstanding is the fact that only 1.0 per cent of the both-Catholic "first" marriages in Iowa took place in March 1953. Even among mixed-Catholic marriages ( mostly under church auspices) there was a 50 per cent drop in marriages in this month. Protestant denominations showed no such variation. By excluding all marriages involving Catholics, the "seasonal" decline in this month disappears entirely.

time been divorced were officiated by a clergyman. Undoubtedly, in addition to the lesser concern of previously married persons with a religious ceremony, as shown by the widowed-only group, the various prohibitions of some denominations against remarriages of divorced persons within the church is an important factor bringing about this result. Nevertheless, divorced persons do get married--without church sanction.
Occupational Variations. A rather clear gradation in the proportion of marriages begun by religious ceremony appears according to the socio-economic classification. For "first" marriages the range is from about 80 per cent for the laboring and semiskilled groups to about 95 per cent for the farming and professional classes. The same variation is quite apparent in the "divorced" class of marriages also. It is noteworthy that the occupations with higher proportions of divorce (as shown by another study) also show higher proportions of marriages by civil ceremony for all marital types.4
By Religious Denomination. For "first"

marriages the affirmation of "Protestant" only or "None" was associated with belowaverage percentages by religious ceremony, while only one-third of those in the "Not stated" group were married by a clergyman. Intermarriage of Catholics greatly decreases the percentage by religious ceremony: from 94 per cent for the both-Catholic group to 71 per cent for the mixed-Catholic group. In the Protestant group of "first marriages involving couples of the same or different Protestant denominations, about 95 per cent were begun under religious auspicies.
For all religious groups the previously divorced were less often married by a clergyman. However, considering the frequent preachments against divorce, the drop in the percentage of "church" marriages seems only moderate for those couples declaring specific Protestant denominations. In cases where the religion of both bride and groom was recorded as "Protestant" only or "None", relatively higher proportions (over half of these marriages) were by civil ceremony. For the Catholic groups only one-third of the marriages involving a divorced person were by religious ceremony.

cator" of divorce with reference to other
aspects of the record. This method must be
employed cautiously, however.5
Using records for which the facts of re-
marriage were given (encompassing about
88 per cent), "first" marriages were found
to account for 68.5per cent of all marriages,
with variations among the denominations.
The proportions of "first" marriages were
higher than the average among Catholic
and Reformed couples.
One or both parties had had a divorce in
25 per cent of all marriages; and over 80
per cent of the remarriages involved a
divorced person. According to the husband's
or the wife's religion similar relationships
are observed, with some variations appear-
ing for the particular denominations. It is
apparent that in all denominations a
5There is undoubtedly some falsification of prior marital status. Previously married persons, through misunderstanding or intent, will sometimes claim to be "single." Divorced persons, especially, may seek to hide their status. Also, where multiple statuses pertain (widowed and divorced) one only (widowed) may be declared. Finally, if a large number of persons do not indicate their status it is risky to assume (on any basis) that there is no bias or desire for secrecy particular to one group or another, or that the unknowns would be distributed in the same proportion as the known data.

considerable proportion of the remarriages involve previously divorced persons. Although below average, in Catholic remarriages the Catholic had been divorced in half of the cases, and in three-fourths of the remarriages either they or their spouses had been divorced. In this regard some denominations registered lower "divorce" incidence among the remarried than did the Catholics, and others about the same proportions.
In evaluating these figures, it should be recognized that some denominations may restrict (in effect, prevent) the remarriage of their communicants by prohibition of remarriage of divorced persons. This could help to account for the "low" divorce percentages in remarriages for some groups. However, as these records show, such divorced persons may get married by a civil officiant and correctly declare their religious preference on the marriage certificate. In a previous article it was shown that Catholics probably had only half the divorce rate of the total Iowa population. And, here again, we find that in only 14 per cent of all marriages of Catholics (husbands and wives separately) was one or other of the parties divorced as compared with 25 per cent for

the whole population of Iowa. The proportion of divorces was lower among the marriages of persons who designated themselves as members of the Reformed Church than among the Catholics.
When we refine our statistics to refer to combinations of religion, so as to attend

more closely to those which are homogamous, we find higher percentages of "first" marriages among those of the same faith. The both-Catholic marriages show only 9 per cent of all their marriages involved a divorced person, versus 30 per cent for the mixed-Catholic marriages. Here, too, sur-

prisingly few marriages in the both-Reformed group involved a divorced person. A spouse was less often previously divorced in the marriages of Lutherans and Presbyterians than among those of Christian Disciples and Baptists. The Methodists rank in a middle position.
The Petitioner in Divorce Actions
Because remarriages differ from "first" marriages in many characteristics, it might be supposed that there would be a departure from custom and husbands would initiate more of the petitions. It turns out that there is no such difference. In both types of marriage the wife started the divorce action in 77 per cent of the cases.
The variation between the denominational groups was small. Women started the actions somewhat more often when both parties were Catholic, and mixed-Catholic divorces held only a slightly above average position.
Duration of Marriage Before Divorce
Broken marriages which linger before legal dissolution could tend to depress the yearly rate of divorce. On the other hand, a quickness to divorce might be taken as an

indication of marriage fragility. Do Catholics or some other religious denomination, we may ask, tend to have significantly longer or shorter marriage durations?
"First" marriages last considerably longer (71 per cent longer) than remarriages as measured by the crude mean and median durations of marriage at the time of divorce. In the general context of understanding, and in discussions of divorce and its elements, probably most people have "first"

divorces in mind. Since an unequal degree of remarriage in different groups could create a bias among the groups, and since couples in all groups have one chance to be counted as "first" divorces, it is most important that we concern ourselves with this class of divorces.6
"First" divorces of mixed-Protestant (denominational) marriages are dissolved 1.5 years sooner than the average (mean), and those of like faith last about a year or two longer than the average for the whole. The shorter duration of mixed marriages is most apparent in the Catholic types, where we find the mixed-Catholic group being dissolved over three years sooner than the both-Catholic marriages. The mean duration of the both-Catholic marriages (11.5 years) is 1.7 years above the average for all "first" divorces. Some other denominations (both-Methodist, for example) , it should be noticed, have as long or longer a duration as the both-Catholic type. In remarriages there is a considerable narrowing down of some of the denominational differences.
In general one can see in these figures a suggestion of a relationship between a low divorce rate and a longer duration of marriage. The both-Catholic marriages show lesser divorce incidence and longer duration before divorce than the general averages. Compared to these marriages, the mixed-Catholic types show higher divorce incidence and shorter marriage durations. There is no exact concomitance, however, between a low rate of divorce and a long duration of marriage for all denominational groups in this set of data. On the whole it appears that while divorces of Catholics
6See: Excerpts, Marriage and Divorce in Iowa, Annual Report of the Division of Vital Statistics, Iowa State Department of Health, Des Moines, Iowa, for 1950, pp. i, ii; and Thomas P. Monahan, "How Stable Are Remarriages?", American Journal of Sociology LVIII (November, 1952), pp, 280-288. There are no particular "impediments" to divorce in Iowa. A controlled analysis of Iowa divorces in recent years has shown that the greater proportion occur in the first year of marriage, declining rapidly after the second year and more slowly as the duration of marriage grows.

have a longer duration of marriage, it is not large enough to begin to account for the low level of divorces among them, especially since the durations for some of the other denominations are equally as long. If Catholic strictures operate to delay divorce among them, then some Protestant denominations must also exercise a strong constraining effect.
Prior Divorce in Divorce Cases
A high proportion of divorces are of the repetitive type. Indeed, our national divorce rate is constantly exaggerated by the increasing ease with which divorce-prone persons enter and reenter the marital lists in a sort of serial polygamy.
When the prior marital history of couples is given on divorce records, we may glean some information about the relative prevalence of divorce among different groups. A high proportion of "first" divorces and a low proportion of prior divorces would suggest (but not prove) a greater stability of marriage in a particular group. The information must be used cautiously, however.
In 18 per cent of the divorce cases both parties had been divorced before, and in 41 per cent of the cases one or both of the parties had been divorced previously. In data of this, type the Catholic husbands (and wives) do not have the advantageous position heretofore found, several denominations showing smaller percentages of prior divorce than the Catholics. Again the "Protestant" only and "None" groups register higher than average figures on prior divorces.
If we separate the marriages of like faith, the both-Catholic divorcees exhibit relatively low amounts of prior divorces, and the mixed-Catholic couples relatively high frequencies in this "divorce" scale. Within the Protestant group, divorces involving mixed denominations tend to show higher proportions of prior divorce than do those involving couples of like denominations.

For the previously married class of divorce actions, both parties had had a prior divorce experience in 35 per cent of the both-Catholic group and 34 per centof the like-denominations of Protestants. On the whole these figures suggest that remarried Catholics are as divorce prone as the average, and hence the Catholic ad-

vantage in general marital stability does not hold as well for remarriages.

under 18 affected by decree," and (3) "How many of these children living at home?" Although there has been a presumption that questions regarding "children" in divorces have been reported accurately in the past, cross tabulations of the new data and editing of the records revealed that the responses were not always consistent or clear. Therefore, these data must be considered with some reservation.7
7The old question, "Number of minor children affected by decree," probably obtained a count only of those children under 18 years, rather than all those who had not reached their legal majority (at age 21 years), which has been assumed in the past. Before we can draw reliable conclusions from divorce data for the United States, the information

Denominationally, the lowest percentage of "childlessness" was found in the bothLutheran group (27 per cent) followed by the both-Catholic group (32 per cent), with the average number of children in these groups for those with offspring under 18 years of age being the same. As to "children by this marriage" (all ages), both religious groups show only 23 per cent were childless at the time of the divorce. The mixed-Catholic types of "first" divorces had above-average percentages with no children,
on children needs a great deal of refinement and improvement. See, Thomas P. Monahan, "Is Childlessness Related to Family Stability?", American Sociological Review 20 (August, 1955).

but among divorces in which the wife was the Catholic the average number of children (for those having children under 18 years) was the same as for both-Catholic couples.
It was surprising to find that in the bothCatholic divorce class the average number of children per couple was not much above the average.
Conclusion
At the 1954 meetings of the Public Health Conference on Records and Statistics, the suggestion that an inquiry on religious preference be included on the proposed forms for marriage and divorce registration received a favorable consideration. But, not getting unanimous approval, "Religious preference or denomination" was recommended to the Conference and to state officials as an optional item to be included on the standard form for marriage

registration only. If persons who are interested in the statistical concomitants of religious preference would take positive action to further such an objective, and if the religious denominations themselves would lend their support, we could in time achieve an adequate nationwide program of population statistics, as well as marriage and divorce statistics, on the subject. It should be noted that the techniques are at hand which permit a perfectly anonymous collection of such demographic data (on a sampling basis, if need be) to which very few people could object.
The Iowa experience is a demonstration of the possibility of gathering such information on religious preference and the way it can be put to use. The continued accumulation of these records should enable us to further clarify our understanding of this important aspect of family life.
