THE CHANGING NATURE AND INSTABILITY OF REMARRIAGES

IT HAS BEEN A FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF i n OUr
society that the family is the cornerstone of social structure and that man, woman and child achieve greater personal and social development in the family than they could under any other auspices. Marriage, therefore, has been highly esteemed from early times and, as compared to other countries, the great majority of Americans have entered into the matrimonial state at an early age.1 In our history the remarriage of widows and widowers (which served to reestablish the family bond) was likewise universally acclaimed. None other than the first president of the United States, George Washington, married a "warm widow" (as a rich one was called) .2
Even though the laws of some of the colonies contained provisions for social dissolution of marriage and for remarriage of the innocent party, especially in case of desertion, divorce as we know it today was relatively rare in early America. In many states it could be obtained only by an act of the state legislature.3 Divorce was uni-

to be denounced as an open encouragement to "successive polygamy."4 The remarrying
of the guilty party in particular was some-

still strongly held in ecclesiastical circles.
Remnants of this moralistic attitude are
apparent even yet in certain aspects of our
divorce laws. One rather modern text on
the family (1943) declares, "There is rarely an innocent party to a divorce case."5 In
general, however, the attitude is growing

to a divorce after they follow the legal ritual and pay the necessary fees, in much the same way that they qualify for a marriage license or dissolve a civil contract.6
Early reformers had propounded that one way to reduce the divorce rate would be to remove the possibility of remarriage. However, the overriding right to marry whom one pleased, in the American tradition, made it impossible under common law and the States' rights provisions in the Constitution effectively to prohibit those who had their marriages legally dissolved from marrying again in one State or another. As yet, there is no limit to the number of spouses a person might legally acquire in a lifetime under our divorce system. Nor is this type of serial marriage behavior reserved for entertainers or persons of affluence, such as Tommy Manville who was reported to have had a dozen wives by the ;age of 58. One woman of modest means is rsaid to have obtained her 15th divorce in 'Oregon at the age of 40, and another 27year-old Tennessee woman already has achieved 16 divorces; while, between them, Another couple accounted for 21 marriages.7
CHANGES IN REMARRIAGE
Until recently, although there are no reliable statistics on the subject in this country, it had been the consensus that most divorcees did not remarry. Many well-known writers subscribed to the guess that only

about one-third remarried, while some others estimated it to be about 50 per cent and as high as 88 per cent.8 Available statistics do not easily lend themselves to an exact determination of the proportion of the divorced or widowed who ultimately remarry, now or in the past. In spite of the uncertainty of the information on "divorce," the data we do have, however, give considerable support to the new pronouncements that a large proportion of the divorcees remarry, perhaps as high as three-fourths.
In contrast to colonial times when widowhood accounted for nearly all remarriages, in the last few generations a new element has interposed itself into the American marital pattern--namely, the gradually swelling tide of remarrying divorcees. This drastic change is illustrated in the charts showing the nature of remarriages in the contiguous states of New York and Connecticut.9 Data from a number of other states and cities extending over a period of

According to some data in the early 1900's, New York City, with its large Catholic and Jewish population, seems to have lagged behind up-state New York in the extent of divorce among persons remarrying. However, by 1940 the two jurisdictions were not far apart (cf., National Office of Vital Statistics, Vital StatisticsSpecial Reports, Vol. 15, No. 19, and Vol. 17, Nos. 9 and 13). New York City currently publishes no statistics. Because of migratory-marriage effects state data cannot be accepted as being precisely definitive.

Some population survey data on marriages in all of the United States gathered in 1953 disclosed that 30 per cent of all marriages from January 1950 to April 1953 were remarriages for either party and in 13 per cent of all marriages both parties had been married before. Seventy-five per cent of the remarrying males and 70 per cent of the remarrying females had been previously divorced (Table 1).

Explanation for the change in the nature of remarriage is two-fold. With the increase in life expectancy widowhood has been occurring at older ages when eventual remarriage is less likely and, at the same time, divorce has been becoming more common for American couples at the younger marriageable ages. As a result divorcees predominate among those who remarry. Actually, if it had not been for the rise in divorce in the earlier years of life, the over-all proportion of remarriages would have been on the decline in the past 50 years in the United States.11

first marriages . . . (and) the percentage of failures is less among all second marriages than among all first marriages."14 This conclusion is shared by others but is in direct opposition to certain facts and needs careful evaluation.
The magnitude of the problem and the intricate psychological and sociological character of present-day remarriages will soon lead to an exploration and development of this field by social scientists. Some recent family textbooks, it is true, give it hardly any treatment at all; on the other hand, two monographs published in 1956 deal entirely with this subject. Unfortu-

Complexity of Problem
The social configurations and consequences resulting from remarriages of the divorced as compared to the widowed are remarkably different, howsoever regarded. To mention only a few aspects of the divorce relationship: the presence of children by prior marriages and the special custody and support arrangements for them, the existence--if not nearness--of former spouses, the still antagonistic community attitude toward divorce, and the personal trauma and sometimes bitterness engendered by the divorce experience--all offer peculiar complications in a divorce remarriage.
When it is seen that the three marital types (the single, the widowed, the divorced) intermarry, and that either party may show a complex history (once divorced and once widowed; twice divorced; etc.) a virtual kaleidescope of patterns comes into view. Since the total marital experience of the individual influences his behavior, from the psychological side alone the need for specificity in the study of remarriage classes appears to be of paramount importance in any research on marriage and remarriage. Strangely enough, although some research workers have made this point rather clear, most of the major studies in this field have failed to make use of such distinctions.15

group to have marriages and divorces registered in such a fashion as to permit the assessment of the fundamental facts of marriage, divorce, and remarriage. To a considerable extent, because of this lack of concern, this area of vital statistics has not been developed satisfactorily, and even elemental information on marriage and divorce is still wanting in this country.
A comprehensive question on the full marital history of both parties to a marriage or a divorce is a sine qua non for registration if we are to get broadly useful data on remarriage in the United States. Early proponents of registration and statistics recognized the value of such an item. The legal and statistical arguments for keeping such a record are so apparent that they require no special pleading. However, the reluctance of some state officials to inquire about marital background in their design of the standard forms for nationwide marriage and divorce registration has caused the proposed item to be grievously modified, permitting as an answer either the number of the marriage or the nature of the last marital dissolution. A uniform pattern enabling differentiation of the specific type of remarriage is thus impossible from state to state under the presently operating scheme. The prospects do not look good, therefore, for a completely adequate investigation of American remarriage in the near future from registration records.*

gility increased as the number of the marriages increased.16 A scattering of registration data in other areas can be found to support this position. Since the publication of that article a few other states have modified their program and have brought forth data of the same kind which (although suffering from incompleteness in part) substantiate the 1952 findings on remarriage as a whole.17 In the past year, as mentioned above, two monographs have been published which treat of the success and stability of remarriages and also elaborate on many other phases of the subject, upon the basis of rather specially drawn samples of remarriages.18
IOWA DATA
Only two or three states gather records showing the marital background of couples entering into marriage or being divorced. In Iowa a rather full marital history of the parties is asked for on the new (1953) marriage and divorce forms for state registration. With the help of Mr. L. E. Chancellor, the Iowa State Director of Vital Statistics, it was possible to obtain tabulation sheets on both marriages and divorces according to prior marital history of the couples. Whereas, heretofore, we have been limited in our analysis to remarriages by the number of the marriage without regard to type, now we have for the first time information detailed according to widowhood or divorce. In the period 1953-1955 Iowa marriages totaled 70,901; divorces, 15,502.
Representativeness
Iowa is a fairly representative area in the

mid-Western United States, with a strong agricultural base and a small-industry economy. An outward migration state, its population is over 95 per cent white, about onefifth Catholic and less than one per cent Jewish; and Des Moines, with a population of 178,000 in 1950, is the only city with over 100,000 inhabitants. There seems to be a liberal attitude toward divorce and no special legal impediments are imposed against it, although remarriage within a year without court permission is technically prohibited by law. In spite of Iowa's agricultural emphasis and non-urban nature, the divorce rate per 1,000 population in 1954 was 8.7 compared to the national figure of 9.2. In 1954 the duration-specific divorce rates indicated the marriage fatality rate in Iowa to be about 21 per cent of all marriages.19 All in all, even though it may not represent the condition prevailing in highly urbanized, industrial areas, or in other places characterized by a large nonwhite population, in its geographic region Iowa may be taken as a typical middle-American state.
The nature and accuracy of all data on marriage and divorce (and marital status) need careful appraisal, and familiarity with registration records gives one reason to be most cautious about small differences in findings. This matter and other methodological perplexities are variously discussed in the literature cited.
Nonresidence Differences',20
When marriageswere grouped according to residence a rather outstanding trait was disclosed, recalling the similar figures for Connecticut, New York, and other areas: nonresident brides and grooms registered a high proportion of prior divorce experience, 31 per cent, as compared to 13 per cent for those marriages in which both parties were Iowans. When divorces were

analyzed, it was found that Iowans who married in contiguous states, or elsewhere, also showed a much higher degree of prior divorce. There is a confirmation here of a previously observed tendency for divorcees in general to be unconventional and to marry out of state, either to escape attention or to avoid state regulations on remarriage following divorce.

A simple linear comparison of the Iowa marriages and divorces by type (Table 4) shows an imbalance in the two series. Remarriages are more in evidence in the divorce side of the picture, and this is because of the divorced class and not the widowed class of remarriages.
While migratoriness in marriage and divorce occurrences, heretofore noted, creates a major dilemma in analysis of data for a particular state, for which there is no easy solution in the absence of a nationwide registration system which would permit reallocations of data, refinement of the Iowa data on the basis of residence does not alter the basic contrast in the two series (unpublished tables). In fact, if marriages in which either party is Iowan are compared to divorces of only those couples who were married in Iowa (a comparison certainly not favorable to the divorce recidivism thesis) the relationship is practically the same as for the whole.

Population at Risk. For the calculation of the probability of divorce by marital type, customary Census data on the population structure by marital status are of no use (compare, for instance, Tables 1 and 2 with Table 3), and there is great doubt that the necessary details could be collected with sufficient accuracy in a decennial

estimates the "risk" population of remarried persons of each type. Marriage records, on the other hand, allow the remarried to be counted again each time they enter into another category. Aside from the question of misreporting of true marital status in marriage and divorce records, if bias is to be imputed to divorce ratios calculated with reference to marriage figures, it could be that the method overestimates the size of the remarriage base (s) and thus underestimates the true proportion (s) of failure. For a short time span, however, such a bias should be small indeed. Unfortunately, in order to estimate the true proportions of the many types of marital combinations one encounters, a very much larger Iowa total would be needed.
Another qualification to keep in mind is that marriages of different types (exposed to the risk of dissolution) have different durations extending into the past and contracted under varying circumstances, not exactly represented by the recent 3-year marriage figures for Iowa used as the basis of the following calculations.
Ratio of Divorces per 100 Marriages by Marital Type. The overall ratio,of divorces per 100 marriages in the 3-year period was 21.9. Since this figure is only slightly higher than that obtained by duration-specific calculations, the ratios shown in the chart and in Table 5 might be similarly considered, that is, as approximating the likelihood for each of the combinations of marriages ending in divorce (per 100 marriages).
Primary marriages (a first marriage for both parties) show a ratio of only 16.6 divorces per 100 marriages in that category, but where both parties had been divorced once before the figure doubles to 34.9, and where both parties had been divorced twice or more times before the ratio climbs to 79.4. Not all marital combinations are shown in the chart; some have too few cases per cell. One of the ratios obtained (a first-married bride with a twice-or-more divorced husband) appears extremely high. In this regard it must be remembered that

marital types which are relatively infrequent may not be accurately gauged in this 3-year compilation; and also, in view of the nature of the information and the method, the ratios can only be accepted as approximate. A certain variability appears in the set of figures, but one must hesitate about drawing any inference from them regarding any unequal fragility on the male or female sides which have a similar prior marital history. Allowances for a later age at marriage for divorcees as compared to first marriages (and mortality reduction before divorce could occur) would only accentuate the divorce ratios found. The duration of these remarriages before divorce takes place a second time is shorter than for the first marriages, and this would tend to exaggerate their "rate" of failure. Nevertheless, everything considered, the differences in the "divorce ratios" obtained need not be disqualified to any appreciable extent on these scores.
As to the widowed, they show abnormally low ratios: 9.9 for the both widowed once only, and 2.0 for the both widowed twice or more only. One very important element, which it is not yet possible to eliminate from the results for the widowed classes, is their much older age at remarriage. In a group of 14 reporting states in 1954, divorced grooms (last or prior status) remarried at about age 36, whereas widowed males remarried at age 57--and brides of corresponding classes about 5 and 9 years earlier, respectively.23 The low divorce ratios of the widowed may be due largely to the effect of joint-mortality, such that previously widowed couples do not survive as a unit to endure the rigors of divorce or make it necessary. The divorce ratio of first-married with widowed spouses bears out this surmise of age bias, as witnessed by the ratios of 15.1 for the widower with a first-married wife, and 16.8 for the widow with a first married husband.

CONCLUSION
Marriages which are successful must certainly survive the social storms of life. Those which do not can hardly be called a "success." One author in this field, who compared a divorced and a happily married group in great detail, based his thesis squarely on the point that "divorce is a criterion of marital adjustment."24 However, he and others have produced results which purport to show that remarried divorcees "on the whole are happy and adjusted in second marriages,"25 and a new school of thought seems to be developing around this belief. Whatever the reason for it, there is a fundamental contradiction between the two viewpoints: that remarriages of the divorced are more likely to end in divorce and that divorced persons are as successful in their remarriages as once-married persons.
For the first time in the United States we have been able to gather data on a broad

basis to show the incidence of divorce among remarrying classes. According to this information for one state, Iowa, as for marriage survival alone, it seems that the widowed who remarry fare as well as do the primary marriages, after making considerable allowance for the differential mortality effects upon the widowed group. With the divorced it is the opposite story: a divorce for one party weakens the strength of the marriage bond, and a second divorce experience greatly lessens the chances of survival of the marriage. It may well be that the twice-divorced, who are sometimes referred to as the "neurotics,"26 have only about 20 to 25 chances in 100 for a lasting marriage.
Such are the hard demographic facts for the general population of Iowa, at least. Incidental information from a few other cities confirms this finding. The qualifications to the Iowa data given above should not be overlooked, however; and similar

studies should be made to test the general or special validity of these findings.
All this is not to deny that there are other elements to a truly happy marriage; and the fact of mere legal endurance is not enough. Some marriages are indeed an endless round of tensions and conflict, until "death do them part." On the other hand some divorced persons do achieve a successful remarriage, and perhaps for the 50 per cent or so which manage to survive there is a high level of happiness.
If we take into account the higher proportion of married persons in the population of late, the divorce rate in the United States has been noticeably receding since the all-time high (1946) of the post-war readjustment period. From the demographic point of view, however, it seems we have gradually arrived at a stage in our American divorce history when the eventuality anticipated by Willcox and the statistical warning voiced by him can no longer be ignored.27 Our divorce rate is being com-

pounded by the repetitiousness of divorce among a divorce-prone population group,28 and there seems to exist in our American system a dual pattern of marriage, with "sequential polygamy" being the practice of a substantial minority of the population, entirely "within the law."29 According to one well-known family sociologist, "We are, in effect, operating a type of trial marriage system."30 A realization of these facts should arouse a host of theoretical speculations and perhaps some more extensive research on the subject of remarriage.
28 if we assume that 18 per cent of all first marriages are divorced, following which 75 per cent remarry and one-third of these fail a second time, and 50 per cent of the twice-divorced remarry with two-thirds of these failing again, a rough calculation comparable to Willcox's (op. cit., 1940, p. 350) would show the following: the initial rate of marriage failure being only 18 per 100 marriages, the crude overall rate because of repetitiousness of divorces would be 24 per 100 marriages.
