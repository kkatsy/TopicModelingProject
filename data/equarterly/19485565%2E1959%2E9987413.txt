INTRODUCTION
IN NUMEROUS REPORTS ON THE SEX RATIO
at birth of not only the human population but also many animals, it has generally been believed that the birth rate of males is, except for some rare species, about the same as that of females.
Ever since Graunt (1662) and Siissmilch (1741) reported that male births, compared with female, always show a numerical superiority, many workers have accepted their reports as quite reliable. As long as the mechanism of sex determination is explained by the action of X- and Y-chromosomes, the chances are 100:100 for both boys and girls. In practice, no matter what the theory, the higher rate is reportedly ascribed to male births.
Many differing opinions have been offered tentatively concerning reasons for the higher birth rate of males. Some of these are as follows:
1. Y-sperms are able to achieve fertilization more frequently than X-sperms. This view was held in common by Schultz (1918), Hertwig (1927), and Ciocco (1938). Schultz observed that
*Some references are incomplete because of the loss of many journals and reprints during the Korean War.

the sex ratios of stillbirths after fertilization of 3 months, 4 months, and 5 months were 123.7, 110.5, and 108.1, respectively. He furthermore claimed that the rate of stillbirths is 4 out of every 100 births, 8-10 months after fertilization; 9 out of 100, 4-9 months after fertilization; 14 out of 100, 3 months after fertilization. In his report on the sex ratios of stillborn or aborted children in several countries, Hertwig gave the following figures-- 128.3 in Germany, 142.2 in France, 131.1 in Italy, and 132.2 in Austria. Ciocco, in his sex-ratio study, reached similar results, thus endorsing the report of Schultz; that is, the longer the embryo remained in the uterus, the more the ratio decreased. This hypothesis, the present writers are led to believe, is more or less acceptable. It still lacks, however, some enforcement of the theory that Y-sperms have more chance to fertilize the eggs than X-sperms.
2. There is a commonly held view of long standing that Y-sperms are slightly lighter than X-sperms. However, this view is not acceptable because it has become clear that sperms do not approach eggs in the oviduct by swimming.
3. Hoelzel, Da Costa, and Carlson (1939) tried to solve the phenomenon (i.e., Y-sperms having more chance of

fertilization) with the hypothesis that in fertilization the equilibrium of the sexual hormones of the two sexes is maintained. According to Hoelzel et al., X-sperms in the male organs are more likely to be destroyed when they are combined with the X-chromosomes from the maternal side because the function of the sexual hormones could not be kept well balanced under these conditions. In other words, X-sperms which include X-chromosomes like eggs are easily repulsed by eggs, whereas Y-sperms are easily attracted by eggs, thus enabling Y-sperms to be fertilized more frequently with eggs.
As enumerated above, each hypothesis may claim soundness for its own viewpoint; nevertheless, none of them is founded, so far, on sufficient experimental fact. Further studies in this field must be made to bring about a final solution. The present writers have simply emphasized the well-known fact that Ysperms more frequently fertilize eggs than X-sperms.
The following report is a brief summary of research which the writers have undertaken on the sex ratio at birth of the Korean population, using material collected in recent years.* The writers hope that this report may cast light on establishing the actual situation in Korea in regard to the problem of the sex ratio at birth.
METHODS AND EXTENT OF THE
INVESTIGATIONS
1. The Investigation of 1956
* Our deep gratitude goes to the Asian Foundation whose assistance in contributing a large amount of printing paper has made it possible for us to carry out the task; also, to the highand middle-school principals, teachers, and students, who, with much enthusiasm and encouragement, have helped us collect the materials; and, last but not the least, we thank Mr. Yangeun Chung for his friendly advice on innumerable occasions.

The investigation of 1956 covered 14,655 families in Seoul, 3,572 families in Cheju Island, and 280 families in Ulnung Island. These families were asked to give their sex and the number of births taking place among them from April 1, 1955 through March 31, 1956. 2. The Investigation of 1957
The investigation of 1957 covered 12,616 families in 27 towns or rural areas in Korea. The same method was used as for the year 1956, for the period from April 1, 1956 through March 31, 1957. 3. The Investigation of 1958
For this investigation 10,914 families in many parts of Korea were sampled. Information such as the number of births, sex, birth order, and age of mothers at birth was obtained. This time particular attention was given to eliminating bias--the informants, as they were students, were asked to report on families others than their own, such as those of their uncles, cousins, neighbors, etc.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
With the material aid obtained from the above investigations, the problem of the sex ratio of the Korean population can now be discussed.
1. Historical Review. Ever since Graunt and Siissmilch es-
timated that more boys are born than girls, many workers have accepted this view. Lewis and Lewis (1906), Hartwig (1927), Russell (1936), and Ciocco (1938) made studies on the sex ratio at birth of the world population, and they all reported their findings. They all were of the opinion that 104-106 boys are born for each 100 girls.
Russell (1936) reported that the sex ratio at birth in Korea is 113.1, which indicates it to be one of the highest in

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:25 08 December 2015

the world. Many writers have followed Russell, expressing the view that the sex ratio at birth in Korea is one of the highest. Some other data, which have been collected through an official channel, indicate a still higher ratio than Russell's.
On the other hand, Matsuyama (1944) reported that the sex ratio at birth in Korea was the lowest: 100.7. He obtained his material from families of out-patients at the University Hospital. According to Matsuyama, previous statistical reports such as Russell's and his followers, which had described the Korean sex ratio at birth as one of the highest, were not supported by sound, unbiased investigation. Their observations, Matsuyama remarked, may have included enormous errors because of neglecting to consider the age-old attitude of the Korean family--that Koreans are better pleased to have boys born than girls. He asserted, therefore, that the previous data had erroneously shown a much higher ratio than actually existed.

With these two widely differing views in mind, the present writers wish to show their own findings. Table 1 on the sex ratio at birth is based on data collected recently during a three-year period.

Comparing the ratio in Table 1 with other countries, the writers can fairly assert that Koreans possess the highest sex ratio at birth in the world. In the

189
present study possible errors which may have occurred in the investigation conducted through official channels, as Matsuyama pointed out, are eliminated because students participated directly in the investigation. Still the result favors Russell's findings. Furthermore we are led to believe that the method used by Matsuyama--collecting material from patients--is not sound and thus less reliable, for this study has discovered that the sex ratio is low when the parents are physically weak and high when they are healthy. Matsuyama's findings, therefore, came from an extremely uncommon situation. The present writers are certain that the sex ratio at birth of the Koreans still stands among the highest in the world population, as the average sex ratio of Koreans from 1956 to 1958 is 114.99, and theratio is not significantly different for observation during a threeyear period.
The following reasons are assumed to explain the high sex ratio at birth of the Koreans: (1) Still unknown factors accelerating the fertilization of Y-sperms with eggs may be more widely distributed among the Korean population. (2) Korean women may have better physical constitutions than those of other countries. (3) Lethal factors are only slightly distributed in Korea.
The present writers are not able to put forth with certainty any one of these factors above as an explanation. Further hereditary studies of the Korean population may throw light on this problem. The solution must be awaited.
2. Sex Ratio at Birth (classified by area)

lower in Seoul and Cheju Island than in the other rural areas. Using this table, the following sex ratio is established (Table 3).

X2 = 0.30, DF -- 3, P -f-0.95.

The average sexratio in these areas is 113.78, and although each area does not show a statistically significant difference, it is clear that in Seoul and in the rural areas on the mainland the sex ratio at birth is higher than in the islands of Cheju and Ulnung.
Ciocco (1938) remarked in his report on theAmerican sexratio at birth, comparing American urban and rural areas, that there was no significant difference between the two regions, admitting the tendency for more boys to be born in urban areas than girls. Contrary to this finding, Diising (1884) of Prussia, Lewis and Lewis (1906) of Scotland, and Russell (1936) of England were all of the opinion that the rate of male births is higher in rural areas than in urban. The present writers have found that in the urban area (Seoul) more boys were born than in the rural areas. In the islands

the ratio is far lower, which may be explained in the following way: In the rural areas, when newborn children were dead, they were omitted from theregister of births, although they should have been included for the present study, for the rural areas are composed of comparatively less-educated groups. And among the dead, newborn boys were probably more numerous than girls. Another assumption is that sex-linked lethal genes are perhaps more widely distributed in rural areas. If this assumption is reliable, the sexratio of the newborn might bemore or less decreased in the rural areas. But further analysis of these assumptions should be made in the future, and as one method of analysis the writers have tried to calculate both the rates of marriage and fertility. 3. Sex Ratio at Birth By Different Occupational Groups of Fathers
The sexratio at birth has been examined according to the occupations ofthe fathers. For this purpose occupations are divided into four classes: mental, semimental (semi-physical), physical, and others.
As clearly observed in Table 4, the sex ratio is higher when fathers are engaged in physical work.
In Cheju Island (Kang and Cho, 1958), where the occupational grouping of fathers presents a specific aspect, no significant variation has come to light according to the occupational groups.

The sex ratio at birth, however, seemed to be higher in the physical-occupation group.
Bernstein (1954) classified the occupations of parents into masculine and feminine (originally Terman's classification) and pointed out that the higher sex ratio results from the parents' employment in a masculine occupation. Her results are tabulated as follows:

·I Parents in masculine occupation.
II Fathers in masculine, mothers in feminine. III Fathers in feminine, mothers in masculine. IV Parents in feminine occupation.

Bernstein's results are founded on the belief that one's occupation is ordinarily chosen according to his character; that

is, those who have a masculine character are employed in a masculine occupation; those with a, feminine character in a feminine one. They are also based on the belief that Terman's adaptation test can appropriately be applied in his classification of occupation.
The present writers have found almost the same results as Bernstein. Parents whose occupations are physical (masculine in Bernstein's category) have delivered more boys than those in other occupations. The sex ratio at birth has been shown to be the lowest among parents occupied in mental work. Especially the column "Others" in Table 4, which includes artists, journalists, and clergy (occupations all under the feminine category in Bernstein's classification) , shows the lowest sex ratio at birth except in Cheju Island. 4. The Sex Ratio at Birth According to Father's Education
In research done in 1958 the present writers examined the educational background of 10,914 families. Table 6 is based on these findings.

Table 6 indicates that the more highly educated the fathers, the lower is thesex ratio at birth. The difference, however is slight and is not at a significant level. It is apparently correlated with "thesex ratio at birth and occupation," which has been studied above. It is also according to common sense that highly educated persons would be employed in mental work, and the less educated in physical occupations. 5. Sex Ratio at Birth and Parents' Age
Table 7 is based on the data from 1958 in which the age of parents from 10,792 families wasknown; it indicates the relation of the sex ratio at birth to the age

ages. The same view had been expressed by Stieda in 1875.
It is still commonly accepted that when fathers are younger than mothers the sex ratio at birth is low. The present writers could confirm this view throughout their study of various reports and observations. When the age of parents differs, the sex ratio at birth also varies, but the reason for this variation has not been clarified as yet. It remains for future research to determine. 6. The Sex Ratio at Birth andParents' Health
Table 8 shows the relation of the ratio at birth to the parents' health.

of parents.
When fathers are older than mothers, the sex ratio is extremely high; when fathers are younger, the ratio is low. And the ratio is significantly different for parental-age relationships.
Many studies have been made on the relation of the sex ratio at birth to the parents' age, and yet none seem satisfactory as their results are so diverse.
Hofacker (1827) and Sadler (1830) said that when fathers are older than mothers the sex ratio at birth is much higher than in the opposite situation. Ciocco (1938) reported that with parents the same age the sex ratio at birth is higher than when they are of different

Table 8 indicates a higher sex ratio, showing significantly different levels with both parents in good health than when both are physically weak. This result leads to the establishment of the following hypothesis: When the health of the parents is good, there is a greater possibility for sound growth of the embryo. The finding, known from previous studies, that there is a higher birth rate for males in stillbirths and abortions, is evident verification that more boys are apt to be born when the parents are in sound health. If the parents are weak, the embryo also may become weak and consequently a higher death rate of embryos may follow.

7 Birth Order Many research workers have observed
that the sex ratio at birth varies with birth order. The present writers also have examined the relation of the sex ratio of the newborn to birth order. The following results were obtained:

Studies have been made on the relation between the sex ratio at birth and birth order by Lewis and Lewis (1906), Ciocco (1938), Lawrence (1951), and MacMahon and Pugh (1953); they have all asserted that the sex ratio of the firstborn is comparatively higher. Table 10 was made by Ciocco in his study of the American population.

King (1918) conducted experiments with albino rats, observing the sex ratio at birth in relation to birth order, and established the ratio of the first-born to be 112.0and that of the fourth-born to be 103.1. The findings of the present writers also disclose that the sex ratio at birth decreases as mothers bear more children. The reason for this decrease

has not yet been discovered, although many writers have tentatively suggested that the physical constitutions of mothers become weakened in proportion to the extent of their childbearing. 8. The Sex Ratio and Mother's Age
Following the research of Hofacker (1827) and Sadler (1830), many scholars such as Russell (1936), Martin (1948), Jalavisto (1952), Bernstein (1953), Novitski (1953) and Novitski and Kimball (1958) conducted studies on the problem of the sexratio at birth and age of mother. Table 11 is based on the findings of the present writers.

The differential in Table 11is significant. It indicates that the sex ratio at birth decreases as the age of mother increases.
Parkes (1926) pointed out that as mothers become older the sex ratio gradually decreases. Ciocco (1938), however, reported, after careful observations undertaken four times from 1917 through 1934 on the American population, that it was almost fruitless to try to find a certain trend in the sex ratio related to the mother's age, even though he isolated the differential in the sex ratio: 105.8 in mothers under 30 years old, 105.3 in mothers over 30. On the other hand, Novitski (1953), Jalavisto (1952), Novitski and Kimball (1958) reported that the sex ratio at birth was affected far less by mother's age than by father's age.

194 Eugenics Quarterly

Novitski (1953) reported that the sex ratio at birth presented a simple linear regression according to the increase of father's age. However, Novitski--later in collaboration with Kimball (1958) -- studying the American population, modified his former view in regard to the sex ratio and birth order and parents' age. He remarked that the secondary sex ratio is more affected by father's age than mother's and that the variation of the sex ratio according to parents' age presented a somewhat curved line rather than a simple one although it was impossible to make an equation to fit this relationship.
Since the present writers are not provided with data to explain the variation of the sex ratio according to age of father, it is impossible to insert our own viewpoint at this time. That mother's age brings about a variation in the secondary sex ratio has already been seen. The reason for this is very simple: the increase in age of mother causes general weakening in her constitution and deterioration of the quality of the eggs in particular. A similar observation can be made for the paternal side: as the age of father increases, the sperms deteriorate and fertilization is not accomplished so smoothly as before--thus the sex ratio might vary. If the gravity of the damage at birth owing to increased age on both paternal and maternal sides were properly evaluated, the relation of the sex ratio at birth varying with the age of father and mother would become clearly known. This problem still remains to be solved by future research.
SUMMARY
The writers have obtained some data on the sex ratio at birth of the Korean population to use as material for studies in population genetics.

1. The sex ratio at birth in Korea reveals the highest ratio among world populations as Russell (1936) had measured it. The ratio is 114.99.
2. The ratio is shown to be higher in Seoul and in other parts of the Korean mainland (114-115) than in the two islands, Cheju and Ulnung (107-109).
3. The ratios of groups engaged in mental and semi-physical occupations are shown to be lower than those of groups engaged in physical labor.
4. The ratios tend to decrease as fathers become more educated. But these ratios do not differ at significant levels.
5. When fathers are older than mothers, the ratio is high. But when the converse in regard to age is true, the ratio is lower.
6. When fathers and mothers both are healthy, the ratio is shown to be higher than when both have weak physical constitutions.
7. As a number of writers have already done, the present writers point out that the sex ratio is higher among the firstborn and lower in the subsequent births of Korean children.
8. The ratio is higher when the mothers are younger, but as the age of mother increases, the ratio decreases inversely.
