Many attempts have been made to link month or season of birth with various conditions of medical interest, such as prematurity (Bailar and Gurian), congenital malformations (Guthkelch, 1962), mental deficiency (Knobloch and Pasamanick, 1962), and cancer (Dijkstra, 1963). Some of these attempts have been based on simple comparison of numbers of cases born in each month; others have included an adjustment for length of month; and still others have included an adjustment for current birth rates or birth rates at the time the study group was born. Only a very few have been based on a comparison of the study group with a control group of the same age and sex distribution and, perhaps because of a lack of the necessary data, none at all have been based on a comparison of the birth date of the study population with that of a corresponding segment of the general population.
Although most attempts to link date of birth with medical conditions have ended in failure, it seems likely that such efforts will continue because of the correlations already established for a few conditions, notably congenital malformations. We therefore wish to enter a plea for proper comparison of the study data with the distribution of birth date in the general population or in a suitable con-

trol series and to illustrate the errors which can result from failure to do so. This will be done by considering data for a specific disease and population group; namely, cancer mortality in Connecticut residents 1957 through 1961.
In thefive-yearstudy period there were 19,917 deaths from cancer recorded in the white population of Connecticut. Date of birth was abstracted from the death certificates and entered on a duplicate set of the mortality cards prepared by the Connecticut State Department of Health. We are indebted to Mr. Edwin Tracy for providing these cards and the facilities for abstracting birth date. Exact birth date was not available for 489 decedents, leaving 19,428 cancer deaths for study. The distribution of these deaths by month of birth is given in the first column of Table 1. The second column of the table gives the ratios of observed deaths to those expected on the hypothesis of uniform distribution of deaths by month of birth and the third column adjusts these ratios for variation in the number of days in each month. The expected value for column 3 is based on proportion of days in each month. No additional information is necessary to calculate the ratios in columns two and three.
The ratios given in the fourth column

of Table 1 have been adjusted for the number of births by month in 1959, the midpoint of the study period, as determined from official Connecticut natality tabulations. In the fifth column theadjustment is to the reported number of births by month in the years when the study population wasborn, and the data in the last column of Table 1 are adjusted to the estimated distribution by birth date of the current living population. Column 5 is not as accurate as 6, since it does not allow for change in the population due to mortality and migration, especially month-to-month differentials in infant deaths. These factors affect the distribution of date of birth in the current population from which the cancer patients came.
To adjust for earlier birth rate by month (column 5) and birth date in the current population (column 6), the mor-

tality data were divided into 4 broad age groups (under 15 years, 15-44 years, 45-64 years and 65 or more years). In both methods the four age intervals were then studied separately and "expected" numbers of deaths calculated in proportion to the number of births in each month within each age interval. The expected numbers for each month were then added over the four age categories and compared with the number which were in fact observed for each birth month category.
Data for the adjustment illustrated in column 6 are not generally available.We have used special tabulations from the 1960 census in Connecticut, which included a question on quarter of birth. For ages over 15 years, the tabulations by quarter were then distributed into the corresponding months using tabulations, also specially requested, of active

social security accounts with numbers issued in Connecticut. For ages 0-14 years, the census figures were distributed according to registered births by month because the Social Security data were too scanty to be reliable. Since nearly all cancer deaths occur at older ages, this should introduce negligible bias.
Each adjustment of the data gives a different distribution. Adjustment to the estimated current living population (column 6) probably provides the most reliable comparisons and can be used as a rough standard for judging the other methods. Deviations of these other four methods from the adjustment to the current living population have been determined from Table 1 and are plotted in Figure 1. This figure shows the monthto-month variations which are superimposed by these adjustments on the distribution of column 6. These spurious deviations are as large as many of the birth-month cycles reported in the medical literature.
Unfortunately, data on month of birth in the living population are rarely available. However, for populations similar to those of Connecticut, the magnitude of month-to-month variation in cancer death rates will probably be similar, although the location of peaks and troughs may differ from those in Connecticut.
In conclusion, we may note that even though adjustment of the cancer mortality data to the estimated current population (column 6, Table 1) shows a suggestive cyclic pattern, the variations are not statistically significant. More detailed analysis of these data, including study of various age and sex groups and various types of cancer, has not yet revealed any variation in cancer mortality which can be associated with month of birth.

tions are formidable and should be carefully considered before undertaking any work on the subject. One such problem is month-to-month deviations from a uniform distribution of date of birth in the general population. These deviations can create spurious seasonal cycles as large as many of the cycles that have been reported in the medical literature.
