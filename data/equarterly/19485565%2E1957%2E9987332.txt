ferentials as well. Thompson, for example, ascribes rural-urban differentials to the more intense "desires to achieve and to possess" in the city, which children interfere with.4 Bell suggests that the higher fertility of suburbs may be due to the high proportions of people in them who have "chosen familism as an important element of their life styles" rather than upward mobility.6
If the assumption that children interfere with getting ahead is held by potential parents, it would explain greater restriction of fertility by those who are more mobile, or wish to be.6 But what if such people cease to believe this assumption? The purpose of this paper is to suggest that a considerable number of California suburbanites, and perhaps others, no longer consider children to be inimical to getting ahead. Data obtained in a predominantly uppermiddle class California suburb in 1955 indicate that upwardly mobile men do not appear to have smaller families than nonmobile men.

It is worth considering the implications of the fact that this trend has coincided with the coming of age of a generation raised largely in or near the metropolis.
Level of aspiration. Actual mobility may not indicate the relative strength of desires for higher status or willingness to sacrifice for it. It is possible that the non-mobile men in the sample experience the pressures of mobility as acutely as the mobile men, perhaps more so. A better test of the assumption that children are viewed as inimical to advancement lies in the relationship between level of aspiration and family size.
All employed men in the sample were asked: "Suppose you were offered an opportunity to make a substantial advance in your occupation. How important would you feel the following considerations to be, if they were required in order to make the advance?" Table 2 lists the considerations presented.7 The respondent was given a card containing the following responses. If he indicated that the consideration was "more important than any advance" he scored 1. If he said that it was "important enough to require serious weighing" or "not important at all in comparison to a substantial advance," he scored 0. Each consideration was scored in this manner except "moving away from this community." Here the responses just quoted scored 2, 1, and 0, respectively.
High scores on the scale indicate that many of the considerations would be con-
7The items for this scale were taken from Leonard Reissman's study in Evanston, Illinois. See . "Levels of Aspiration and Social Class," American Sociological Review, 18, June, 1953, pp. 233-242. Only those eight items were used which distinguished upper-middle class men from those of lower status and which Reissman regards as realistic requirements for upward mobility. Of those tried, two had to be dropped because they yielded too many errors in the scale. These were: "endanger your health" and "give us what leisure time you now have."

sidered more important than any advance. High scores thus indicate low levels of aspiration. Referring to Table 2, it is worth noting that few of the men have low levels of aspiration: less than one-fifth of them would regard a new routine, more responsibility, or loss of contact with friends as definitely more important to them than a substantial advance; while most of them would balk only at moving around the country a lot or leaving the community. This high average level of aspiration, together with the few "large" families, is exactly what one would predict from the assumption that children are regarded as a handicap to advancement.
When we look at the differences in family size in relation to levels of aspiration, however, it does not seem safe to assume that children are seen to interfere with advancement. According to Table 3, whitecollar men with more children have higher levels of aspiration. This finding merits attention, despite the statistical insignifi-

cance of the differences, because of the regularity of the differences, even when ruralurban background is controlled.

Rural-urban background shows some association with level of aspiration among these white-collar families. Metropolitan men do seem to have "greater desires to achieve and possess," as Thompson assumed. But they also tend to have slightly more children, as noted previously. All of these findings are internally consistent, even though not statistically significant. On what theoretical grounds might one expect a positive association between metropolitan background, level of aspiration, and size of family? Some hints are supplied by a consideration of attitudes about income and family size which emerged in the interviews.

Income. The data presented in Table 4 suggest that income and number of children may be associated differently for metropolitan and non-metropolitan men. Among white-collar men from non-metropolitan communities, those with a single child appear to have higher incomes than those with two or more children. But among comparable men from metropolitan communities, the greater the number of children, the higher the income. Objective-

ly, children and higher income appear to be alternatives for the non-metropolitan men but not for the metropolitan men.
A similar difference appeared in the attitudes of younger and older men. When asked: "What do you think is the ideal number of children in a family?" older men frequently commented that three or more seemed to be the ideal in this community, and then added that they did not see how these younger men expected to rear and educate so many children "properly" if times got hard. These comments seemed to imply an active awareness that children and income were incompatible. Such comments were rarely heard from the younger men.
Unfortunately, these comments were not

systematically sought or recorded, and so cannot be correlated with the type of community the men came from. But one could hypothesize that older men and those from non-metropolitan communities perhaps more often believe that income and children are inimical, while acting on this belief helps to produce a negative association between number of children and income.
Conclusions
An attempt to test the hypothesis that men who have advanced from the working class, or hope to advance beyond their present occupational position, have fewer children than non-mobile men is not supported by the evidence obtained from a random sample of 123 men living in a predominantly upper-middle class California suburb in 1955. The hypothesis is supported in only one respect: namely, that the entire sample appears to have a high level of aspiration and relatively few families of three or more children. But the upwardly mobile men do not have fewer children on the average than the non-mobile men, whether white-collar or blue-collar. And among white-collar men, those with more children have higher levels of aspiration, as measured here; although the differences are not statistically significant.
Some clues to a possible explanation of these findings are provided by certain observed differences between the men from metropolitan and non-metropolitan childhood backgrounds. It has been suggested that non-metropolitan men may have had a greater tendency to regard children as inimical to income. Why should they? Any explanation needs to account for this feeling and for the possibly lower levels of aspiration of non-metropolitan men.
One explanation may be that metropolitan men are somewhat more ready to adapt to the requirements of the urban occupational system, particularly its social mobility. It seems reasonable to assume that the type of scale used here to measure "level of aspiration" indexes not only desire for

advancement but also readiness to make any adjustments which are called for. The scale score may be seen as a resultant of both forces. Looking back at Table 2, one can see that adjustments to three kinds of change are suggested: in the job and its social relations, in primary group relations, and in residence. If men who have spent most of their childhood in metropolitan communities have had more experience in adjusting to these changes successfully, they could be expected to face such changes again more readily. Men from non-metropolitan communities may lack such experience, or have found it more disturbing. This view is consistent with Lipset's finding that men who spent their childhood in larger cities are more likely than men from smaller cities and farms to be upwardly mobile within large-scale organizations, even when education is controlled.8
A most important reason for younger men to regard advancement as compatible with a moderate number of children lies in the conditions of advancement which they have experienced. The younger, metropolitan men of the sample more often have a college education. More of them began at well-paying jobs and were able to achieve upper-middle class status earlier, without working their way up from lowly beginnings. Above all, they have achieved thier status during a period of prosperity. For any or all of these reasons it might seem to them that children were no obstacle to a higher standard of living. It is worth noting that in the Indianapolis Study "feeling of economic security" was found to be positively associated with number of children among those generally more-successful, upper-middle class couples who practiced effective contraception.9 According to the present interpretation this feeling of

213

security may well be a product of greater readiness to adjust to the requirements of a job advance or other change.
This analysis suggests in conclusion that greater restriction of fertility may be seen as a consequence of individual social mobility under conditions which appear to demand greater sacrifices in return for

higher status. Prosperity, higher education, and successful experience in adapting to the social mobility required by the urban occupational system all minimize the impact of social mobility, with the result that younger white-collar men from metropolitan backgrounds may no longer see children as inimical to advancement.
