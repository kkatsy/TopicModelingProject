In demographic terms, the trend of Puerto Rican fertility has not left room for great optimism. The crude birth rate of 40 characteristic of the past half century has been lowered only within the past two years and may only reflect the temporary breakup of families due to a large scale emigration. Various studies have indicated modest decrements in marital fertility, but these have been compensated for by earlier marriage. Combs and Davis in interpreting the lower age at marriage and the consequent increase of first order births hoped that it reflected a modern type response to economic conditions but feared, in the absence of wide-scale birth control practice, that it might only mean increased fertility. They suggest, in the light of the rapid modernization of the Commonwealth, that "family limitation sufficient to lower the birth rate substantially may be just around the corner."1 It will be the function of this paper to explore some of the factors influential in sustaining high fertility, and to give some indication of the extent and effectiveness of birth control practice among different groups in the island's population.
Source of the Data
The Social Science Research Center of the University of Puerto Rico has for the past three years been engaged in studies of attitudes relevant to fertility and birth control. The total project can be divided into three phases:
1. An exploratory study involving intensive qualitative interviews with a small number of families.
1"The Pattern of Puerto Rican Fertility," Population Studies, March, 1951, p. 379.

2. A large scale, objective type interviewing study to verify or nullify hypotheses developed in Part 1. Part A: Brief screening interviews with a sample of 3000. Part B: Longer interviews with a sub-sample of 1200.
3. A series of controlled experiments designed to test the conclusions of Phases 1 and 2 by employing various techniques of persuasion on selected groups in the population.
Field work has been completed for parts 1 and 2, and analysis has been completed for Parts 1 and 2A. The present paper will lean chiefly on the latter for its data, describing the other phases briefly in subsequent sections.
Phase 2A, conducted by Reuben Hill and the writer, secured information on the knowledge and use of birth control of 3000 Puerto Ricans. A five-to-ten-minute interview was conducted with men and women meeting the criteria of married (or mated) and fertile (at least one pregnancy) who entered nine of the island's public health centers between August and October of 1953. These centers give free medical care of practically all types to any individual desiring it. Table 1 compares several characteristics of the sample group with the total population.

not to select cases who appeared "too old." Consequently, whereas close to 9 per cent of the total population of married women is 55 years of age or more, less than 1 per cent of our sample falls in this category. Moreover, while the medians for education are identical, the sample has a dearth of cases in the extreme groups--no education and high school education--probably because these two groups are less likely to take advantage of free facilities. However, in general, the sample corresponds fairly well to the general population, although the possible bias involved in dealing with a "health-oriented" population cannot be determined.
Differential Fertility
Let us first see to what extent the members of the sample evidence differential fertility.2
In the youngest age group education and residence appear to bear little relation to fertility, perhaps indicating that in all groups family limitation is not initiated early in marriage. This is in accord with Hatt's attitude data which shows that well over half the population, with little difference, by education or economic level, believe that the first child should come as
2For evidences of differential fertility in the total population see J. W. Combs and K. Davis, "Differential Fertility in Puerto Rico," Population Studies, Nov., 1951; and Paul Hatt, Backgrounds of Human Fertility in Puerto Rico (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1952) Chapter VI.

soon as possible,3 and with our own qualitative data indicating that many women desire to get childbearing over with as soon as possible. However, as age increases, the differences in fertility increase, both education and residence appearing influential. Maximum fertility is achieved by the rural respondents of no education, and minimum fertility by the urban well educated.
Since these factors are of such importance, a brief examination of the trends in education and residence for Puerto Rico would seem relevant. Table 3 shows that the island has been moving steadily toward those factors associated with low fertility.

The Practice of Birth Control
Differential fertility is normally the product of differential use of birth control, but we do not usually associate Puerto Rico with birth control. Actually a good deal of family limitation is practiced. In the present sample, despite Catholicism, low average education, and youthfulness, 53 per cent

have at some time in their marriages practiced some form of birth control, and 37 per cent are currently using a method. A third of the sample has used or is using mechanical or chemical methods, a fifth have used or are using natural methods and a fifth are sterilized.4
Education, which was seen to be such an important correlate of fertility, shows a similar relation to birth control use. Fortythree per cent of those with no education and 60 per cent of those with six years or more of education have used birth control. Only a slight difference is shown by residence, but the combination of residence and education indicates that the latter has a greater impact on urban respondents.

Since education is strongly correlated with age in Puerto Rico, Table 4 shows the

effect of education when age is held constant.
In general the middle age group is the one most likely to have practiced birth control. This is not surprising, since they are more or less of the younger generation which is less conservative and has had more birth control materials available. Moreover, unlike the younger group, they are experiencing considerable fertility pressure. By and large, education continues to affect birth control use regardless of age, but its impact is most striking among the older groups. For younger individuals who have not yet felt the pressure of fertility, education makes relatively little difference. Thus, if an individual is well educated, once he feels the pinch of numbers on resources, he is much more likely to act than is the individual of the same age but with little education.
The Effectiveness of Birth Control
While the extent of birth control practice is of course important, the vital question is how effectively the methods are used. Table 5 gives some indication of the effectiveness of various categories of contraceptors.

·Modern methods refer to the usual chemical mechanical techniques; "natural" methods to withdrawal and rhythm, the latter representing a very small proportion of the "natural" category. Where combinations of "natural" and modern occur, they are included in the latter category.

4No other recent data on the frequency of birth control use is available. In 1947, Hatt reported that 6.6 per cent of a representative sample of the island's women were sterilized. However, the rate of sterilization in the past five years has probably increased considerably. More important, it is felt that Hatt's interviewing methods were not such as to elicit maximum reliability of response on this

subject. In our sample, 500 interviews conducted by nurses rather than trained interviewers showed a much lower proportion of knowledge and use of birth control, indicating the importance of careful interviewing. For more detailed considerations of sterilization, see Hatt, op. cit., pp. 443-452; and J. Mayone Stycos, "Female Sterilization in Puerto Rico," Eugenics Quarterly, June 1954, pp. 3-9.

Several points should be noted: (1) The fertility of the never users is not so different from the users as might be expected. In the earlier marriage period their fertility is extremely low, and in the older group, the difference in pregnancies between current users of modern methods and non-users is only 0.7. This may be partly due to the fact that individuals with lower fertility feel less need to practice birth control. Moreover, even within the two length of marriage groups, they tend toward the lower age limits. (2) Current contraceptive users have only slightly lower fertility than past users. (3) Current users of modern methods have the same fertility as users of "natural" methods. In the past users group, their fertility is even higher. (4) Sterilization, while the most effective method,5 is undergone too late to be of maximum effectiveness. (Thirty-eight per cent were sterilized after at least six pregnancies. The mean number of children borne by completion of childbearing is six for the total population) .
The main conclusion to be reached from the foregoing would seem to be that despite widespread practice of birth control, the

methods are used so late or so ineffectively that their effect on fertility is minimal. Among which groups in the sample is birth control most ineffective and what accounts for this ineffectiveness? Table 6 answers the first part of this question.
Table 6 shows that in general the better educated are more successful as regards birth control. They appear to have their sterilizations at an earlier date than the less educated and practice birth control somewhat more effectively. Among the more recently married, residence appears to make little difference in effectiveness, but in the older group urban cases appear to practice birth control with considerably more effectiveness.
The explanation for the erratic and shortlived utilization of birth control methods appears to have little to do with availability of materials. Seventy-six Public Health Units and as many sub-units are scattered over the small island and offer weekly prematernal clinics where free advice and materials are supplied. A fair number of women attend these clinics, but many never return to replenish their supplies.6
A possible explanation both for non-use

5Sterilizers have an unexpectedly high number of pregnancies in the "less than ten years married" group because of a bunching toward the end of this period. For each five year period of marriage except the first, they show fewer pregnancies than the other groups.

6In 1945 these clinics distributed, among other methods, about 40,000 dozens of condoms. By 1950 the figure had increased by only 7000. In 1950, the clinics showed a case load of 22,000, but in that year alone, 6300 cases dropped out of the clinics. (Department of Health Annual Reports.)

and ineffective use of birth control would be ignorance of methods. In terms of sheer awareness of the existence of various techniques of contraception, however, the present sample leaves little to be desired. Only 6 per cent said they had never heard of a birth control method, and even this estimate is probably too high (see footnote 4). Nine out of ten know sterilization, nine out of ten know at least one mechanical or chemical method, and six out of ten know withdrawal. As might be expected, a higher proportion of ignorance is found with the rural, the poorly educated, and the young.
A more serious drawback, especially as regards the effectiveness of birth control, concerns the time of inception of knowledge. In a culture where women are sheltered before marriage, and where discussion of sexual matters is generally taboo, even husbands and wives are reluctant to discuss birth control methods.7 Consequently, women tend to learn about birth control methods relatively late in marriage. In a sub-sample of 890 wives and 320 husbands (drawn from Phase 2B), 60 per cent of all methods known by the wives were learned sometime subsequent to the third pregnancy. Only 8 per cent were known before marriage. In the case of the males, 50 per cent of all methods known were known prior to marriage. The methods which would be of greatest use early in marriage are the ones learned latest. For example, sterilization is learned early, 22 per cent knowing this method prior to marriage, but other methods are learned much later.
Another important deterrent to use and effective use would be lack of motivation to practice family limitation, or adverse attitudes toward the methods themselves. In terms of ideal family size, there is little question that the average mother is in favor

of the small family. Seventy-three per cent of the women in our sample and 80 per cent of the women in Hatt's sample gave their ideal family size as three or less. Moreover, both Hatt's study and our own indicate that religious objections are minimal. There are, however, many other objections to birth control which make its adoption difficult and its practice short-lived.8
For the Future
At the Social Science Research Center we hope to be able to throw more light on the psychological and social factors associated with fertility. In Phase 2B, we have, along with more precise measures of fertility and birth control, more ample and precise data on such psychological and social factors. Traditionalism, levels of aspiration, modesty, family size ideals, and concern for virility are some of the psychological variables we are working with. Our data on interpersonal relations focus on matters such as communication between spouses, marital adjustment, and empathy. The influence of reference groups on knowledge and attitudes with respect to family size and family limitation is also being analyzed.
For the present, our information is probably sufficient to make a few generalizations and predictions. (1) An interest in the small family is characteristic of all socioeconomic and residence classes in the population. (2) Birth control is attempted by a large proportion of all groups in the society, though to a greater extent by the

Detailed analysis of these interviews is provided in the writer's forthcoming volume, Family and Fertility in Puerto Rico.

better educated. (3) A low degree of success is achieved, particularly by rural, poorly educated groups. (4) A great number of objections to birth control based on faulty or insufficient information are among the deterrents to the effective practice of family limitation.
There is every indication that only a fair-sized push would make users out of non-users and effective users out of noneffective ones. A natural push is occurring

gradually by means of increasing urbanization, education and secularization of values. An island-wide educational program would doubtless accelerate the fertility decline. But with or without a program it is a good bet that the "birth control corner" which Combs and Davis speculate about is not far off. Whether it is close enough to save the island's families the anguish of having too many children for their as yet slim resources is another question.
