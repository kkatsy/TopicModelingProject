DEFORMED NASAL SEPTA AND RELAXED SELECTION

The wide variety of growth abnormalities in the nasal cavity--conveniently termed together "septal deformities"-- are sufficiently frequent and serious to occupy a host of surgeons, who have produced a large literature. Yet no etiological explanation of their high frequencies has been offered other than that some cases are traumatic and others hereditary, together with the repeated statement that higher frequencies occur in Caucasian populations. The aim of this paper is to summarize the literature on the heritability of deformed septa; to present frequency data on samples of skulls from 22 populations, the largest of which is European; and to offer a hypothetical explanation of the higher frequencies found in populations with longer histories of "civilization." Briefly, it is suggested that the rigor of natural selection in eliminating hereditary and deleterious abnormalities has relaxed in populations with longer histories of civilization as contrasted with "primitives" who are still living in hunting or foodcollecting culture-habitats.

been reported, both indicating a high degree of heritability of septal deformation.
Schwarz (1923) described three categories of twin pairs: (1) mirror image identity, (2) twins similar in type and degree of nasal cavity deformity, and (3) twins different in type and degree. Frequencies for monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) pairs were:

The higher frequency of identity and similarity among monozygotics (28/53) than dizygotics (7/31) is significant statistically, Chi square with 1 d.f. being 6.2, P less than .02. This fact justifies making an estimate of heritability, which is

Schnitzler (1933) has reported similar results:

HERITABILITY AND RACE
While no family history investigation of septal deformity has been completed, hereditary factors are frequently assumed, in addition to environmental factors (Hinkel, 1887; Benjamins and Stibbe, 1927; Berblinger, 1928, p. 13; Jackson and Jackson, 1959, p. 38; Schaeffer, 1962, p. 19; Gill, 1963, p. 653; Davis, 1964).

.005) and the estimate of heritability which is thus justified is
M-D 73.5-29.6 43.9 __ 100-D - 100-29.6 ~ 70.4 ~ These two studies indicate that septal deviations are strongly influenced by hereditary factors as to type, site, and degree of deformity. They imply, as noted by Schnitzler (1933), that septal deformities cannot be explained primarily by environmental forces.
Population studies of septal deviation are limited to casual observations. Only two serious anthropological studies have been found (Gleitsmann, 1885; Talbot, 1894). No definitions or classifications of types of abnormality have been made. Yet the opinions of several physical anthropologists whom the author has questioned are consistent, that the highest frequencies occur among European whites, the lowest among hunting and food-gathering people such as certain American Indian and other aborigines, while Negro populations present intermediary frequencies. Such was also the opinion, it is believed, of two late deans of physical anthropology in the United States--E. A. Hooton of Harvard and Ales Hrdlicka of the Smithsonian Institution. Among the more recent medical authors who share this opinion are Berblinger (1928, p. 12); Keogh (1952); Jackson and Jackson (1959, p. 39); Gibb (1963, p. 1569); Gill (1963, p. 653); and Seltzer (1963). Somewhat broader consideration was given by Delavan (1887) and Talbot (1894, pp. 251-293).
METHODS AND MATERIALS
The wide variation of septal abnormalities defies classification, for which there is no precedent. Berblinger (1928, pp. 12-13) has described five "types" of deformities: bending, buckling, S-shaped doubling, spurs on base, and deviation

of the entire septum, with total frequencies ranging between 53% and 80% in four studies. Goodyear (1962, p. 6) estimated the total frequency at 90%. Gleitsmann (1885) in an excellent review of studies of some 2,500 Caucasian skulls cites from 69% to 77% asymmetric and deformed septa. Cottle (1960), Loring et al. (1958), and Heatley (1937) have published sketches of various "types" of deviation. In the present material, most of the asymmetries and outgrowths occur at the symphysis between the lower border of the cartilaginous region of the septum and the superior border of the vomer. The premaxillary and palatine ridges also are frequently deformed. The superior osseous region is more rarely deformed, and usually to less marked degrees. Any portion of the septum may be involved. (See Fig. 1 for some variations of deformities.)
Since the present considerations depend more on the degree of abnormality with respect to functional occlusion of the air passages regardless of the morphological type or site of the abnormality, skulls have been graded simply as to the degree of occlusion on left or right side in each of three regions: (1) cartilaginous region; (2) inferior osseous region, i.e., maxillary-premaxillary crest, palatine crest, and/or vomer; and (3) superior osseous region, i.e., vertical plate of the ethmoid. Four grades are employed: normal, slightly abnormal, markedly abnormal, and very markedly abnormal. These categories are of course arbitrary, subjective, ill defined, and far from satisfactory. But they are expedient for the present purpose and offer the only possibility of making the study. Sex was recorded, and side--whether the left or right nasal passage was occluded. Blockage or partial blocking by the turbinâtes on the side walls of the nasal passages

was also noted and recorded if to a marked degree.
Abnormal septa are defined as those that are considered to have sufficient asymmetry or unevenness to interfere to the slightest degree with breathing, on either side. The three categories are defined no more precisely than by the adjectives that describe them. They were established in the investigator's mind after examining several dozen Caucasian skulls repeatedly, then testing himself by scoring 100 skulls several times. Errors were 6% on the first test, lower on succeeding tests. Several dozen Caucasian skulls were examined and scored once or more each day thereafter prior to scoring non-Caucasians. While this procedure is far from exact, it does not seem unreasonable after a few days of practice; and the 6% error is considerably smaller than the differences in the frequencies of abnormalities encountered between "civilized" and "primitive" samples.
The principal problem, a serious weakness of the study, is the poor state of preservation of the septum in skulls more than a few years postmortem. The cartilage is very rarely intact, and both the inferior and superior osseous regions of the septum are frequently damaged and occasionally absent. Cartilage abnormalities are appraised by the state of the margin of the adjoining osseous region, i.e., the suture between bone and cartilage, either inferior or superior. The bony margin is normally flat; abnormality is indicated by a wrinkled or crinkled or bowed margin.
The decision of whether or not to score a skull exposes the examiner to an additional source of bias, against which he can fortify himself only by practice.
Another weakness is the impossibility of correlating skull morphology with nasal function of the living.

Particular care was taken to distinguish postmortem shrinking and warping of the septum from growth abnormalities. The former are usually distinguishable by cracks or breaks in the septum, mechanical appearance, rarity, and marked degree. In contrast, biological asymmetries are extremely variable, not only from one skull to another, but particularly from spot to spot within a septum, usually compound, and always irregular.
Twelve samples of skulls were examined (Tables 1 to 5) at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, ten samples at the U.S. National Museum in Washington. Of the former, the Europeans are modern Austrians; the Chinese are from northern China; the Egyptians are Islamic, i.e., recent; the Papuans, better termed "Papuo-Melanesians," are from New Guinea, New Hebrides, and the Solomon Islands; the Dakota and Montana Indians are from several northern plains tribes; the Aleuts are from the Aleutian Islands. Of the U.S. National Museum samples, the Europeans are German and Russian; the Egyptians are XII dynasty; the Chinese are coolies from Alaska, of southern Chinese origin; the Mongols are from Urga. The Hawaiian skulls and the Indian skulls are believed to be largely, perhaps almost entirely, unmixed racially, most of them pre-Columbian.
Since the samples differ widely in age, cause of death, and a host of selection factors stemming from their wide variation in culture (environment), they can hardly be regarded as unbiased representatives of their respective populations. This may be the greatest weakness of the present study.
RESULTS
The principal observation is the low frequency of normal septa in samples of

Vol. 13, No. 2

the three populations with long histories of "civilization." This is most notable in the cartilaginous region, for which the percentages of normal septa are 33 for the smaller Chinese sample, 37 for the modern Egyptians, and 38 for the Austrians (Table 1, second column). In contrast, the "primitives" range from 56% to 79% normal. The sample of Pueblo Indians from New Mexico and Arizona holds an intermediary position with 45% normal, which is particularly interesting since they have a long history of agriculture. Only the larger sample of Chinese departs from the principal observation, with 68% normal. (They were born and raised in Canton Province, then migrated to southern Alaska, where they died.) The proportion of "marked" deviations to "slight" is also higher among the "civilized" samples.
The inferior osseous region presents a similar contrast between "civilized" and

"primitive," but less pronounced than in the cartilaginous region (Table 2).
In the superior osseous region the contrast is even less pronounced and more irregular; yet the difference in frequency of abnormalities between the larger samples of Europeans and Eskimo is significant, viz. Chi square (2 d.f.) is 10.7, P about .01 (Table 3). Several samples are quite out of line, notably the Chinese from Alaska, XII dynasty Egyptians; and the smaller sample of Europeans. Nevertheless, the overall situation is the same.
The relative differences in frequencies of septal abnormalities between males and females, and between left and right sides were investigated in the largest two samples. No difference is indicated between either the sexes or the sides (Table 4).
Marked blockage or occlusion by excessive development of the turbinate bones--one or more of them--was re-

The Australian aborigines have a surprisingly high rate of occlusion; the Chinese coolies from Alaska, a surprisingly low rate. The Australians also have a higher frequency of deformed septa than samples of other hunting populations (Tables 1, 2, and 3).
DISCUSSION
The higher frequencies of septal deformities among populations of European descent in contrast to other races

that is often mentioned in medical literature seems to be fully confirmed by comparisons between the present skull samples of Caucasians and non-Caucasians. Critics have commented that this may be explained by the typically higher nasal bridges of Caucasians, by their more frequently elevated and highly arched hard palates, and/or by the greater reduction in size of their faces. Examination of the present samples of skulls does not support these explanations. Classification of "low" and "high" nasal bridges in 58 European skulls chosen at random fails to confirm an association with septal deformation, viz:

The Egyptian skulls have relatively few high nasal bridges; the Chinese, none; yet two of these samples have high frequencies of septal deviations. On the other hand, many North American Indians have high nasal bridges, and few have septal defects. Elevated hard palates are extremely rare in the Caucasian samples and absent in the others. The American Indian, Aleutian, and Eskimo samples are hardly more prognathic than the Caucasians.
Bilateral asymmetries of the nasal bones and of the premaxillae at the base of the external pyriform aperture have been studied in about one half of the skulls. While these asymmetries appear to be more frequent among Caucasians than among "primitives," no overall association with septal deformation is indicated. However, some of the more

exaggerated cases of left-right asymmetry in the breadth of the "nasal sill" at the base of the pyriform aperture suggest an association between the side of greater growth and the side with concave septal deviation, both of which factors contribute to enlargement of the nostril. On the opposite side the convexity of the septum, added to a reduction in the breadth of the "sill," produces constriction of the nostril. Such asymmetry often appears to be a result of differential speed of ossification between the two opposite sides of the vomer, and/or premaxillary and/or maxillary, along the mid-sagittal symphysis. These bones are of bilaminar origin, with complimentary ossification centers on left and right sides. Perhaps bilateral asymmetry in speed of ossification is under genetic control. This explanation was suggested by Hinkel (1887).
Evidence of trauma was sought in the European male skulls, since it has often been alleged that considerable numbers of septal deviations might have arisen from injuries, falls, etc., particularly during childhood (Keogh, 1952; Loring, et al., 1958; Klaff, 1956; Riggs, 1961;Jennes, 1964). Fifteen cases of apparent trauma are noteworthy, some of them questionable; but only six have deformed septa. The total number of septal deformations in the present sample of European male skulls greatly exceeds 15--they number 167 in the cartilaginous region, 104 in the inferior, and 71 in the superior osseous regions. One can hardly assume trauma to be more frequent among Europeans than among other races. No evidence of regeneration was found. The role of trauma therefore appears minor.
It might be suspected that European septa are thinner than those of other races, thus accounting for their greater frequency of deviations. In the present samples, on the contrary, the Eskimo and

Aleutian septa seem more thin-walled than the others. Their low frequencies of abnormalities convey only a minimal impression of the uniformity of their notably flat and symmetrical surfaces. Possibly the chewing of foods during childhood, i.e., jaw exercise, produces optimal growth of the facial bones, with minimal rates of deformities. It is not certain that young Eskimos and Aleuts chew more than other races, however. Possibly, abnormal septa are selected against at higher rates in colder climates, among hunters.
A number of other possible explanations suggest themselves, which unfortunately could not be tested. The ages of the European skulls were undoubtedly greater than those of other series; but since age changes in septal deformation beyond puberty are unknown, no age analysis was made. European diet and masticatory habits are quite different from those of the other populations; but, again, we are ignorant of the interrelationships of diet, mastication, and morphology. It would be interesting to compare the frequencies of septal deformities in populations recently acculturated with their savage ancestors, particularly if they differed in face form, malocclusion, overbite, etc. It is trite to point out that very little is known of the hereditary adaptations of any part of the body to environmental differences, even including the gross variations in climate such as between Oceania and Alaska.
It is noteworthy to add in conclusion that while the present samples differ quantitatively in the frequency of septal deformities, no two samples can be differentiated qualitatively by their forms. In all 22 samples the variation in the morphological details of septal abnormalities is extremely wide. Yet these details are found again and again in individuals of all samples. It would be

impossible to determine the race of any sample from the morphologies of its septal abnormalities.
HYPOTHESIS
Progressive decrease in the size of an organ as a result of changed or slightly diminished function and a correspondingly slight reduction in selection rate is a well-known evolutionary phenomenon, sometimes called "negative allometry." It is recognized that phylogenetic reduction in the face (Schaeffer, 1962, p. 19) and paraseptal cartilages (Beck, 1963) has occurred. But this evolutionary process is orderly and adaptive: it does not disturb functional efficiency. In contrast, the phenomenon of high frequencies of deformed nasal septal in a population is disorderly and maladaptive, resulting in losses of efficiency and function. It is suggested that this phenomenon corresponds to a marked rather than to a slight reduction or relaxation in the rigor or natural selection. In the abnormal septa observed in this study the variation in form of abnormality was marked, and none of the variants were adaptive; indeed, they were all disadvantageous.
Among the most profound environmental changes that the human species has experienced since its origin was the abandonment of hunting and food collecting as ways of life, resulting from the development of agriculture and/or pastoralism, several hundreds of generations ago. Our hunting ancestors were dependent, and contemporary hunting populations are still dependent, on the efficient performance of many faculties: keen vision and hearing, physical endurance under stress including starvation, etc. In contrast, agricultural environments have permitted tolerable livelihoods and almost normal rates of re-

production for persons with less efficient faculties, even with minor defects and abnormalities. This subject has been discussed more fully by Post (1965).
The "survival value" (to employ a Darwinian term) of a normal nasal septum in the wilds should be judged in the light of its functions--vis., the moistening, warming, and cleansing of air during respiration; the draining by ciliary action of discharge from the lacrymal ducts and several ostia into the pharynx; as well as olfactory sense-perception. The health hazards of septal deformities to civilized man are well known. Air must circulate freely and evenly to all portions of the nasopharynx. Septal deviation produces overventilation on the concave side, underventilation on the convex side. The former leads to excessive drying of the mucous membrane witht consequent paralysis of the cilia (Riggs, 1961; Gill, 1963). Underventilation at the orifice of an eustacian tube or ostium may foster low-grade tubal infection, leading to tinnitis or deafness in the former case or sinusitis in the latter (Griffin, 1897; Coakley, 1930, pp. 149-150; Heatley, 1937). Basic therapy is usually surgical correction of septal spurs, ridges, and/or deviations.
Septal deformities may be mild enough not to impede nasal breathing during ordinary quiet respiration, yet may interfere greatly with nasal breathing during exercise. The most comprehensive treatment of this subject is found in Proetz (1953, pp. 32-41, 67, 155-166, 194, 282283, 360-362, 383-384, 412-413).
To primitive man, mouth breathing presents very serious problems and hazards. The tracking of animals, pursuit of or flight from enemies, arduous seasonal migrations, and many other activities require sustained physical effort under conditions of nasal respiration except during sprints or spurts. Chronic

mouth breathers cannot keep pace, and those who lag from the group are often doomed. Guerilla warfare trainees know all too well the handicaps of a dry throat or blocked nostril, particularly in cold or dry weather, while living outdoors for several days and nights continuously.
The handicaps of mouth breathing in hunting culture-habitats were emphasized by the great traveler and ethnographer George Catlin, who described how carefully American Indian mothers used to train their babies to breathe through the nose (Catlin, 1872, pp. 1-4). During many years with Indians of North and South America, Catlin interviewed the chiefs and elders of some 150 tribes before their cultures were broken. Delavan (1887, p. 210) mentions Indians covering their mouths before falling asleep to train themselves in nose breathing.
Nasal deformities and the catarrh and infection they produce also impair the sense of smell, which may have been important in some primitive cultures. Travel and hunting in unmarked wild country can be facilitated by odors, principally of vegetation but also of animals, particularly at night in damp woodlands, as anyone with an unusually keen olfactory sense can appreciate. As Kalmus (1960) has said, "the sniffing and tasting of food and its subsequent acceptance or rejection have probably been of great survival value to primitive man."
SUMMARY
Genetic control of deformed nasal septa is evidenced in two studies of identical and fraternal twins, which are briefly reviewed.
The frequencies of nasal septa that are deformed sufficiently to impede nasal respiration are reported in samples of skulls from 22 populations, totaling 2,353

individuals. Samples of Chinese, Egyptian, and European skulls have about twice thefrequencies of abnormalities as have American Indian samples and about three times those of Aleuts and Eskimos. The proportion of markedly deformed to slightly deformed septa isconsiderably higher among the "civilized." A sample of Pueblo Indian skulls from theSouthwest ranks between the "civilized" and the other Indians. Ancient Egyptians rank lower than modern Egyptians.
Most cases of abnormality appear to stem from arrested development, on one side alone, ofa pair of ossification centers.
The markedly higher frequencies of deformed septa among the samples of "civilized" populations as contrasted with the"primitives" is attributed hypothetically to a reduction in the efficacy of natural selection among the former in eliminating thegenetic factors that produce septal deformities, during the many generations since their ancestors abandoned "primitive" cultures.
ACKNOWLEDGMENT
Gratitude is expressed to Dr. H. L. Shapiro and to Drs. T. D. Stewart and J. L.Angel, respectively of the American Museum of Natural History and the United States National Museum, for permission to examine skulls; also to members of their staffs for many thoughtful courtesies. Anumber of points werecontributed by readers of a preliminary draft, towhom grateful thanks are given.
