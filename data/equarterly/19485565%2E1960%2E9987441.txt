T
JLHERE HAS BEEN GREAT RETICENCE AMONG
most authors of textbooks on marriage and the family about developing the subject of premarital coitus and pregnancy as one of the underlying circumstances of marriage for a large proportion of Americans (44; 45). The historian Charles F. Adams, in an essay on fornication, illegitimacy, and premarital pregnancy in early New England times, pointedly remarked upon the "almost systematic suppression of evidence" by writers in his day (1, p. 480; 2, pp. 15960; 29, p. 600; 30, vol. 2, pp. 185-98; 7, Vol. 1, pp. 132-33, 154, 204, Vol. 2, pp. 43-44, 204, Vol. 3, p. 222). Recently, the investigations of Kinsey and his associates have done much to dispel the cloak of silence surrounding sexual behavior in general, but there is no doubt that present-day commentators and public figures tend to avoid the subject (32; 33; 27).
Even though sexual relations out of wedlock were severely frowned upon by

early Colonial churchmen and leaders, according to the records of the time such a practice was quite common. The community was generally tolerant, provided marriage was forthcoming, especially if there were a child; and, one's spiritual salvation could be restored if a public confession were sincerely given. During a period marked by a "moral reawakening," one-third of the couples in one church who were admitted to communion made such a confession (1, p. 497; 7, Vol. 1, p. 133). As civil law gradually took precedence over church doctrine, we find that although fornication becomes punishable by statute, prosecution is often suspended by marriage before the birth of the child.
Premarital pregnancy is a rather common phenomenon in most societies. In Scandinavian countries and other parts of Europe, where the biological continuity of a family is a first consideration, premarital pregnancy is an accepted part of the marriage system, and we find that one-third and more of all first births occur within 7 calendar months of mar-

riage (8 to 20; 23, 24; 27; 56, pp. 40, 86, 600-01).
In Australia prior to the second World War over one-fourth of all first births occurred before the end of 7 months of marriage; recently, however, the proportion has been much smaller, being in 1955 some 18 per cent before the end of 7 months and 21 per cent before the end of 8 months of marriage (3; 4; 21, p. 40; 49, p. 173). Interestingly enough, premarital conceptions in England (among first births to women married once-only, roughly within 8i/£ months of marriage) came to about the same figure, or 20 per cent in 1955 (26, p. 90). In the United States, also, various estimates suggest that women who marry are pregnant at the time of marriage to about the same extent. The figures regarding premarital sexual intercourse for men and women, indubitably, are much higher.
REVIEW OF STUDIES
Because birth records in the United States do not contain information on the date of marriage, a determination of the extent and the characteristics of premarital pregnancy in this country as a whole cannot be made in a direct way.2 Miscellaneous information does exist in the literature, much of it being an incidental by-product of special studies, such as those upon child marriages, elope-
2In Australia the day, month and year of birth and marriage are used in the determination; in Great Britain, the month (but not the day) of marriage is on the birth record. Birth records in the United States do not ask for date of marriage. The dates of marriage and births of family members have not been obtained in U. S. Census counts, either, and because of this the recently derived figures on births by duration of marriage and child spacing are only approximate, being especially inaccurate for the first year of duration of marriage. It is noteworthy that some published studies on child spacing ignore the element of premarital pregnancy. The 1960 U. S. Census does ask for month and year of birth and month and year of marriage in the sample enumeration.

ments, widow-pensioners, desertions, divorces, marital adjustment subjects, birth control program participants, obstetrical and gynecological clinic cases, persons receiving psychiatric treatment, parents of juvenile delinquents, and so forth (27, p. 35--10 per cent; 5, p 64-- white mountaineers, contraceptors, 25 per cent; 28, p. 100--parents of juvenile delinquents, 37 per cent, parents of nondelinquents, 28 per cent; and other references cited in this article). Unfortunately, many of these studies (besides being based upon rather selected population groups, with no common age or marital status refinement) do not specifically define what is meant by "premarital pregnancy."
In line with their interest in the success of "forced* or "shot-gun" marriages, social workers made premarital pregnancy a part of their inquiries into domestic discord. As early as 1915 the Philadelphia Municipal Court separated out this factor in its tabulations of social data on domestic relations cases (43: 1915, pp. 169, 180, 1916, p. 203, 1917, pp. 3233, 81-82, 1918, pp. 39-40, 85; 39, p. 303). Premarital pregnancies, determined by comparing the date of marriage with the date of birth of the first child, among widows receiving support in one state were several per cent higher than the 1915 Philadelphia findings. In interpreting the discovery that 19 per cent of the widows were premaritally pregnant, Colcord pointed out that these families of widows "were by no means an unstable segment of the population," and offered the suggestion that many such marriages were not really forced, and would have been contracted anyway (22, p. 93). Raymond Pearl in the late 1930s similarly classified a large sample of hospital maternity records, widely gathered, but the proportion of births which he

135

termed prénuptial was much smaller: 7 per cent for white mothers and 22 per cent for nonwhite mothers (40). Unfortunately, the time interval allowed before counting a child as premaritally conceived was not given in these studies. Among a group of native white, Protestant, non-contraceptors in their primary (first) marriage, the findings of the Indianapolis fertility study, conducted at about the same time, indicate that premarital conception may have been as high as 16 per cent (34, pp. 68-69).
The derivation of this kind of information by a system of record linkage is an old one (references on request). As part of an inquiry to determine the completeness of birth registration, Stouffer in 1934 traced a large group of urban marriages, predominantly white, which took place in Wisconsin in 1930, making special use of city directories and the postal system. From these data he developed certain aspects of the premarital pregnancy pattern, considering children born "within 7 months" (not otherwise defined) after marriage as premaritally conceived, which amounted to 17 per cent of the whole (48, pp. 143-46; 49, pp. 154, 172-76).
At about the same time Christensen sought to discover by record linkage the interval from marriages of couples within a county in Utah to the birth of their first child, if any, in the next four years (8; 9; 10). And, resuming and extending his careful line of inquiry on child spacing some 10 years later, Christensen traced for a five-year-span marriages to birth records for couples within an Indiana county (11 to 15). He has become the chief American investigator in the field of premarital pregnancy and its outcome, and a modern proponent of the record-linkage method of study (16; 17).

MEASUREMENT
The matter of honesty in reporting dates of marriage and dates of birth of children where there is a premarital pregnancy is an unknown quantity, and on this point we may only hope that falsification does not vary much from group to group within a universe of data. Aside from the question of accuracy of reporting, the method of measurement of premarital pregnancy--whether lunar months or calendar months are used, and whether 7, 8, or 9 months is taken as the dividing point--clearly affects the magnitude of the percentage found. If all marriages are included, since some of them are childless, a marriage-based figure will be smaller than one derived from birth records; and refinement of measurement according to first-births and first-marriages also has relevance. In comparing different sets of figures, the exact point of reference or definition of premarital pregnancy should be kept in mind. A retrospective study will also be somewhat more adequate than one which traces marriages forward on a state or local level, particularly because recently married couples are mobile and the premaritally pregnant are known to move away (even if temporarily) to avoid attention within their county or community of residence. The results for specially chosen groups might also be expected to vary, depending upon the age-level or the marital type, the class or the subculture in question. Each set of data, therefore, requires careful appraisal.
However, regarding special population groups, provided they are not too selective or unique, it is reasonable to propose that internal subclassifications of the data with reference to such characteristics as age at marriage, race-orcolor, religion, occupation, and the like,

136 Eugenics Quarterly

will reflect the underlying relationship in the population as a whole. For, if the pattern of premarital pregnancy as between parts within a subgroup were not generally representative of the prevailing situation in the population from which they derive, then we would have to assume that premarital pregnancy was somehow sifting out more of the premaritally pregnant in one part of the subgroup than in another part. Furthermore, we would have to assume that different classifications of the data had similar distortions within each or all of their elements. When one appreciates the degree of interrelatedness of the various social characteristics, such completely chaotic biases--to invalidate all of the contrasts found in the different subclasses studied--cannot be expected. One finds much more reason to accept the proposition of "suggestive representativeness of differences within special groups" than the opposite. [Christensen's presentation of cross-cultural "regularities" in premarital pregnancy is in accord with this thesis (20)].
The likely representativeness of internal contrasts within specially chosen groups of data is additionally confirmed when (1) There is a reasonableness about the differences discovered in the data which argues for their tentative acceptance; and (2) Diversely phrased special studies all strongly point to the same broad relationships regarding age at marriage, occupation, religion, raceor-color, or migration. If such is the case, then, we have good reason to believe that there is a basic underlying trend in the data common to all, and that the findings, therefore, roughly represent the relative condition in the population as a whole.
However, the results from special kinds of populations, even those which

have a broad origin, should not be used as a good demonstration of the magnitude of differences between groups or classes. The only satisfactory answer to the question of magnitude or complete representativeness would come from a general census or survey of the population, or record linkage, which is costly and has not been done for any sizeable group in the United States.
FAMILY PROBLEM CASES IN PHILADELPHIA
The Municipal Court of Philadelphia has been in operation for over 45 years and is well known in the community as an available socio-legal aid to families in difficulty. Although the principal legal issue of concern to the court in the domestic relations division is with the problem of non-support of wife or children (child dependency, delinquency, and illegitimacy being handled in other divisions of the court, while divorces are heard elsewhere), non-support is often not the exclusive or main issue in contention. All manner of family difficulties impel husbands and wives to seek out court assistance, ranging from family quarrels, or simple desertion by the spouse, to grievous cases of assault and battery (43, 1957). Basically, these cases are largely self-initiated and do not depend on social-worker referrals or reliefagency actions. A large proportion of the couples are living together, and their cases are settled often without a court hearing.
Statistical data presented in the Annual Reports of the court and elsewhere over the years show that while certain population classes appear more often than others with domestic problems, no segment of society is without some representation and the selectivity in these cases is a moderate one. The court is

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:25 08 December 2015

available to all and is used by all classes; it is not just a "poor man's court."
Premarital pregnancy, of course, does not inevitably lead to difficulty or preclude a lasting marriage. And, even in the more limited area of divorce where premarital pregnancy seems to increase the risk (14, 20), the great majority of divorce cases originate for distinctly different reasons (37, p. 24). Family problem cases of the kind to be analyzed here, it may be seen, draw upon an even larger part of the population. In the period 1950 to 1954, about 4,500 new families came to the domestic relations division each year for help, while Philadelphia marriages were averaging 15,000 a year, and divorces 3,200 a year.
Out of a total of 5,086 new families making application in the domestic relations division in 1954, 3,509 primary marriage families where the wife was a Philadelphia resident were separated for detailed analysis. Those couples who had children born before the expiration of 8 calendar months and 14 days were classed as premaritally pregnant, using the day-month-year of marriage and the day-month-year of birth of the children. (In addition, a smaller scale study of family cases in 1953 was made, counting children born in less than 8.0 calendar months as premaritally conceived.) Because various other facts were extracted from the records, it was possible to relate premarital pregnancy to other characteristics of the family. For the reasons given above, it is believed that this information will shed light on the probable variation regarding premarital pregnancy within the population as a whole. Of course, because the families are a special type, with "court" problems, these findings cannot be taken as an accurate gauge of the magnitude of premarital

137
pregnancy in the total population of Philadelphia or any of its elements. Trend. The proportion of premarital pregnancy manifested in different time periods is known to vary (3; 11, p. 57). In the Philadelphia court data for 1917 and 1918 (discarding the 1915 and 1916 results as somewhat dubious), the proportion of "forced" marriages (undefined) was about 14 per cent. Using the data for 1953, 471 primary white marriages in 630 families and 410 Negro primary marriages in 525 families, and weighting downward the Negro part of the total to compare with the population distribution in 1917-18, we find that 17 per cent of all couples had given birth to a child in less than 8.0 calendar months after marriage. A large part of the 3 per cent difference could be accounted for if a 7 month measure had been used at the earlier date. Nothing, therefore, can be said positively about any trend in premarital pregnancy among the families which came to court on the basis of these data. Marital Type, Race or Color. None of the studies made heretofore have refined their data for both race-or-colorand marital type, although such a distinction seems a fundamental one in marriage and family studies. It should be noted, however, that in most of the studies the populations were predominantly white. From the one major study which delineated the racial aspect, Pearl's study of maternity cases (40, pp. 181, 330; cf., 5, pp. 61-62), it might be expected that premarital pregnancy and illegitimacy would vary with race. In the United States, nationality or national origin data are becoming statistically indistinguishable because of intermarriage.
The 1917-18 court figures on race and nationality disclosed variations between the classes, although for some reason the

138 Eugenics Quarterly

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:25 08 December 2015

contrast between the whites and Negroes was small (Cf., 50, pp. 77, 135, 226; 51). If we compare the premarital pregnancy proportion in court families in 1953 (using 8.0 months or less as the measure) with the "forced" (undefined) marriage proportions in 1917-18, the figures for all classes of marriages of whites are 14 per cent in both periods; but, for the Negroes the proportions are 15 per cent in 1917-18 and 38 per cent in 1953. Whether this means that Philadelphia Negroes (or even those who come to court) have relaxed their moral standards cannot be said with any assurance, however.
In the domestic relations cases for 1954, Negro primary marriages (a first marriage for both parties) revealed a considerably higher proportion of children born in less than 8 calendar months and 14 days following marriage, in comparison to that shown by previously divorced or widowed couples, or 46 versus 22 per cent. White primary marriages registered only a slightly higher proportion than the remarried, or 20 versus 18 per cent. Court families of the remarried type quite often do not have children of the present marriage, reducing their premarital potentiality, and information on children in such families, is somewhat unclear, on the whole. These are strong technical reasons for refinement of the data for first marriages only.
In line with the foregoing, the 1954 family cases were tabulated and analyzed in terms of primary marriages subclassified for whites and Negroes.
In some of the cases no children had been born. If the wives in the primary marriage groups who had no children ever-born are excluded from the 1954 figures,the proportions of those who had children of this marriage born within 8 months and 14 days after marriage in-

crease from 20 per cent on a family basis to 22 per cent on an offspring basis for the whites, and from 46 to 51 per cent for the Negroes (Cf. Il, p. 57). As can be seen from Table 1, in a certain proportion of the families children were actually being born before the marriage

·Primary marriages are those in which both parties are married for the first time. Using the day-month-year of marriage and the day-monthyear of birth of the first child to each married couple, all those having children before the end of 8 months and 14 days after marriage were considered as premaritally pregnant. A smaller study of cases in 1953, using 8.0 months as the point of measurement (471 white and 410 Negro first-marriages) disclosed premarital pregnancy percentages of 14.6 and 44.0, respectively. Excluded from the above calculation were 8 white and 13 Negro couples for whom premarital pregnancy could not be determined.

took place: 1.6 per cent for the whites and 14.6 per cent for the Negroes. Since marriage in these cases comes after children are born, it might be supposed that free hospitalization and relief policies (Aid to Dependent Children under the Social Security Act) regarding "illegitimate" children might be a contributory factor in this result (41; 42). Type of Case. The classification of families in terms of the type of case they represent is somewhat of a judgmental matter, even as regards the charge of non-support. However, as between whites and Negroes, the degree of premarital

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:25 08 December 2015

pregnancy is more than twice as high for Negroes in nearly every category. The type of family problem alters but does not change the strong contrast in the percentages as between whites and Negroes.*
Type of Ceremony. All family cases in 1915 and 1916 (not refined for marital status), in spite of their overall ambiguity, showed civil ceremony marriages to be twice as often "forced" as were marriages initiated under religious auspices --for both whites and Negroes. Christensen's population studies confirm this relationship (11; 19; 20).
Oddly enough, the Negro group of primary marriages in the 1954 court cases shows no pronounced variation according to type of ceremony. This might mean that for Negroes religious and civil marriages do not represent distinct categories.
However, in the white group of firstmarriage families, not only do the religiously officiated marriages show about half the proportion of premarital pregnancy which appears in the civil-ceremony-only group, but also, rather significantly, those white first-marriages which were followed by a second ceremony (usually a church marriage following the civil marriage) register a percentage with premarital pregnancy falling midway between the religious-only and civilonly types of marriage ceremony. These double ceremony marriages may have a certain precipitousness about them, not necessarily due to pregnancy. (See Table
Religious Belief. Stouffer's urban data for Wisconsin showed no overall difference in the degree of forced marriage as between those performed by a Catholic or a non-Catholic officiant; nor did

·Primary marriages. (See Table 1.) fReligious includes a small number of joint civil-religious ceremonies, usually on the same day. Double ceremony marriages include second performances for the same marriage at different dates or places. Civil includes a few common law marriages. Not given includes ceremony or premarital pregnancy unknown.

Pearl's maternity cases show any difference between white Catholics and white Protestants (49, p. 175; 40, p. 181). Catholic "divorces" studied by Thomas, however, indicated that the mixed-Catholic group had a somewhat higher degree of premarital pregnancy (undefined) than the rest (50, pp. 82, 150; 51, p. 106).
Comparing Protestants with Catholics in the 1954 domestic relations cases, no noteworthy difference appears in the primary marriages of the whites as to premarital pregnancy. Only the Jewish group, as was true in Pearl's study, shows a lower registration in this regard. The higher socio-economic position of the Jewish group, and all that this connotes, would tend to account for their lower rate. The mixed-Catholic groups and the mixed-Protestant denominations, according to these figures, have higher proportions of premarital pregnancy than others in their respective classes (both Catholic, both of the same Protestant denomination; see Table 3.)
Among the Negroes, the variations between the religious groups are not at

all outstanding, but, once again, the percentages in all religious subdivisions are distinctly higher than among the whites. Only the mixed-Catholic Negroes resemble the white pattern of percentage increase in premarital pregnancy with mixture of religion.
Age at Marriage and Relative Age. A number of previous studies have shown that premarital pregnancy is highest at the younger ages and decreases with later age at marriage (11; 19; 20; 27; 46, p. 406; 50, pp. 150, 175, 182, 227; 51, p. 107). In the 1954 (and 1953) Philadelphia family cases we find the same situation with respect to the husband's and the wife's age at first marriage. (See Table 4.) No clear pattern of births before marriage, premaritally conceived, by age at marriage of the wife appears in the results, however.
Where the wife is older than the husband (whites and Negroes), or of the same age as the husband (whites), there seems to be a tendency for premarital pregnancies to be lower than the average. This is in accord with other findings, but the relative age relationship does not stand out as a predominant one in the scope of this study (50, pp. 89-91).

Table 5, (53, 1957, p. 224).] Surprisingly enough, for whites and Negroes, in both 1953 and 1954, first marriages which took place in Elkton, Maryland, which was a Gretna Green in former times, showed only a slightly higher percentage of premarital pregnancy than the overall average.
In the Negro group the results were quite remarkable and contrary to expectations. Only a small proportion of the first-marriagecouples (18 per cent) were both born in Philadelphia, but in this group was found the highest percentage of premarital pregnancy: 61 per cent. Where only one party was born in Philadelphia, or one party was born in the South, the percentages drop to 47 and 49 per cent, respectively. But the lowest figures of all were for couples both of whom were born in the South and married there, 34 per cent; while those couples who were both born in the South but married elsewhere showed an intermediate figure of 45 per cent. Indeed, since at least one spouse was born in the South in three-fourths of the cases, the

overall proportion of premarital pregnancy for the Negroes would have been much higher if they had followed the style of the native-Philadelphia Negro couples coming to court.
One interpretation of the 34 versus 61 per cent contrast in the Negro data might be that native Philadelphia Negro brides who are pregnant at the time of marriage have a greater likelihood of appearing in court than do those native Philadelphia Negro brides who are not premaritally pregnant; and that this same tendency does not apply to the Southern-based Negroes. There is not much reason to expect such an unequal parceling out with respect to premarital pregnancy as between Negroes of different mobility statuses. On the other hand, if the results are taken tentatively as an indication of the conditions that might actually prevail in the Negro population, then it might be supposed that Southern Negroes do not wait until the circumstances of pregnancy precipitate a marriage, but rather they move directly into marriage at an early age; while

the more mobile Southern Negroes, and Northern Negroes who become family court cases show a greater and greater tardiness in formalizing their marriages. Even illegitimacy in these court cases among Southern-based Negroes is slightly below the average. It is worth noting, also, that delinquency among children of Negro migrants into Philadelphia is lower than for native Philadelphia Negro children (47).

Among both the whites and the Negroes, again with the Negroes showing much higher percentages in every subdivision, the proportion of marriages with premarital pregnancy declines with increasing length of time the couples had been married prior to separation, or--if still living together-- prior to the time of application to the court. This is in agreement with Thomas's findings for Catholic divorces (50, pp. 99, 212, 228; 51, p. 105; cf., 31, p. 48). (See Table 6.)

tionship is evidenced by the figures on median duration of marriage for these families in trouble. For white couples in their first marriage, the median duration for those who were not premaritally pregnant and still living together was 9.2 years; for those already separated it was 5.5 years; premarital pregnancy without illegitimacy, and then premarital pregnancy with illegitimacy cause additional declines in the median duration. The Negro figures start out at 7.8 median years of duration for those not premaritally pregnant and still living together, and 5.1 years for those not premaritally pregnant but separated; and then the total figures drop in a similar manner to 3.6 years with premarital pregnancy alone, and to 2.7 years with illegitimacy added to the picture.
Here we see for couples living together, and for couples living apart, how they separate or come to court sooner if they have conceived children before marriage. The quickening of family crisis and separation is considerable. Persons who enter marriage under such circumstances, it seems, have special liabilities and difficulties facing them. Undoubtedly, this is to some extent also a result of couples being forced into marriage to protect the mother or to give the child a name, with youthfulness of the partners, and concomitant difficulties, adding further to the adjustment problems. Illegitimacy (children not of this union) in addition to premarital pregnancy before marriage shortens the marriage most of all. For Negro couples, especially, the total family problem is accentuated by the illegitimacy factor. (See Table 7.)
Occupational Level. Premarital pregnancy has been found to prevail to a greater degree in the lower occupationa'

Duration to application relates to cases where couples are still living together; duration to separation, for couples who have separated. The total is a composite of the durations to application and to separation. Illegitimacy in these first-marriage cases refers to children not born to this couple. The figures are a minimum because some may not be reported, especially the husband's illegitimate offspring. In addition to premarital pregnancy (this marriage), 3 per cent of all white first-marriages showed additional children born out of wedlock to husband or wife, and 12 per cent for Negro families.

Some persons argue, therefore, that the much higher Negro rate is merely a reflection of their occupational position. In the 1954 Philadelphia court cases there appears to be a rather definite inverse relationship between premarital pregnancy and occupational level among the white couples but only the suggestion of such a relationship for the professional and managerial class of Negro couples. (See Table 8.) This is in agreement with the only other study reporting on this racial variation (Pearl).
In all of the occupational levels the Negro percentages far exceed the percentages for the whites with premarital pregnancy. Even within the laboring group the premarital pregnancy figure for Negroes is much higher than for whites. The professional and managerial group of Negroes (but not the clerical group) tend to show a diminution in the prevalence of premarital pregnancy, but they still show as a group relatively twice the proportion registered by the professional and managerial group of

whites. The lack of contraceptive knowledge can hardly be paramount in this upper class. The equivalence of occupational groups between whites and Negroes may be questioned, and it would be desirable to control the comparisons still further for education, income, occupational mobility (Cf. 36), and neighborhood. Undoubtedly segments of the Negro group accept and conform to the mores of the white majority. However, one interpretation of these data, taking into account some other evidence, is that there is a fairly common set of attitudes or sexual performance at all levels within the Negro group, at least for the cases which appear in this study. [Illegitimacy, separately tabulated (unpublished) for these married couples, shows the same basic pattern as between whites and Negroes by occupational level.]
Undoubtedly there are several explanations for the differences within the white group. The upper occupational levels of whites may have a greater or more sophisticated knowledge of contraception, as well as different courtship patterns. There may be more self-discipline also in the higher occupational levels or other social outlets, in spite of their delayed age at marriage. In the lower occupational levels where future social and economic expectations may be low, and where any delay between the time of biological maturity and the time for social maturity for marriage may be something of a barrier to be circumvented, fortuitous pregnancies could easily result. Whatever the explanation, the noticeable differences between occupational levels in the extent of premarital pregnancy for white couples is probably a general one in our society.
CONCLUSION
One anthropologist of eminence,

George P. Murdock, speaking before the American Sociological Society in 1949, predicted the acceptance of premarital sex relations, as a form of trial marriage, in our society "within a very few generations," and personally approved of the expected change (38; 54; 55). Of course, great reliance was placed upon the use of contraceptives, so that the possibility of illegitimacy and premarital pregnancy were secondary issues. The problems surrounding illegitimacy and forced marriage (wherein couples have no original disposition to marry) cannot be lightly considered or ignored, however. At the same time it should be recognized that some premarital pregnancy in the United States may be merely a form of marriage precontract, or an anticipation of marriage, as it is in some other societies. If it were possible, the two kinds of circumstances should be separately investigated.
In a general way pregnancy before marriage may be considered to be one of a cluster of factors which characterize some families as being different from the rest. While there is some evidence to indicate that premaritally pregnant couples may be more disposed than the average to divorce (and perhaps desertion, non-support, and other unfavorable outcomes) , at the same time it is well to remember that the great majority of white families which are separated, divorced, or in domestic discord are not in the premaritally pregnant class.
The premaritally pregnant figure of 20 per cent found for the first-marriage, Philadelphia white couples in domestic difficulty in 1954, therefore, might be taken as probably not much higher than the prevailing extent of conception before marriage among all Philadelphia white families (using 8 calendar months and 14 days as the measure). Christen-

sen obtained a roughly similar figure of 21 per cent for the general population of Tippecanoe County (Lafayette), Indiana, and a slightly lower rate for Utah County (Provo), Utah (11; 20, p. 33). Taken along with other studies, it could very, well be that if all the facts were known conception takes place before marriage in about one out of five cases in the United States, recognizing however that many such marriages are by no means "forced."
The main outlines of the phenomenon of premarital pregnancy may be given tentatively as follows: (1) It is more typical of Negroes than of whites, and may also vary with ethnic or national-cultural origin; (2) The lower occupational levels of whites (not as clearly or certainly for Negroes) show a greater proportion of this kind of behavior than the white-collar and professional classes; (3) There is also some evidence which suggests that premarital pregnancy may decline with higher educational achievement (40, p. 182; 27, p. 45) ; (4) Metropolitan cities may evidence more of this behavior than smaller urban communities, although the ruralurban contrast has not been well demonstrated (49, p. 175; 11; 12) ; (5) Catholics and Protestants have shown no difference in this regard, although mixed-Catholic marriages tend to register more premarital pregnancy than homogamous religious marriages. Jewish couples, probably due in part to their favorable occupational position, are less often premaritally pregnant; (6) The younger the age at marriage the greater is the degree of premarital involvement; (7) Civil ceremony marriages show considerably more conceptions occurring before marriage takes place (for the whites) ; (8) Mobility, as evidenced by place of birth and place of marriage

among Philadelphia court families, shows somewhat of a contrary relationship to the expected one: the Philadelphia-based Negroes, in particular, and not the migrants having the highest proportion with pregnancy before marriage; and (8) Finally, the length of acquaintanceship in general is shorter and the length of engagement is often little or none in premarital pregnancy cases (50, p. 158-59, 167, 227; 51, p. 106).
The rate of illegitimacy for the Negro group is higher than for the whites, and the rate is growing. As these Philadelphia data and Pearl's study show, Negroes have a much higher rate of premarital pregnancy than the whites, also (40, pp. 181, 330). The higher rate is hardly to be attributed to social and economic status, because premarital pregnancy is quite considerable in the upper as well as in the lower occupational groups of Negroes, and the ratio of the proportions in the occupational scale is about the same as between whites and Negroes. Migration does not explain the result either, since in the domestic discord cases studied the Northern-based Negroes far exceeded the Southern-based Negroes in the custom or practice. Because of the finding regarding migration status, the theory that somehow the "slave culture mores" imposed upon the Negro are responsible for the results is rendered doubtful in the present-day context. One interpretation, recalling the extent of the behavior in Puritan New England and colonial times, is that Negroes may be following a custom of marriage precontract and have not come to accept the prevailing formal norms of the community, and are thereby evidencing a form of cultural lag. There is a strong presumption, nevertheless, that the sex customs of the Negroes as a whole are part of an American subcul-

tural system (25,p. 11;35,pp. 267ff; 53,
pp. 3-29).
Premarital pregnancy is certainly
worthy of more painstaking research and
discussion, in view of the extent of this
kind of behavior and its consequences in
family life.
