When in 1959 the frequency of red/ green color blindness was investigated in samples of various Hausa-speaking peoples in the northern part of Katsina province, northern Nigeria (Roberts, 1962), it was hoped subsequently to obtain comparative data from populations living in a contrasting environment. The opportunity to do so occurred a few months later during a visit to the heavy forest of the Niger delta. Here instead of the harsh glare of the savana of the North, illumination is much less intense for long periods on account of cloudiness, and the vegetation throws a dense shade, so that the inhabitants are exposed to an environment quite different in terms of light conditions from that of the northern peoples. In the delta some 400 male subjects of all ages from five upwards were tested; after the exclusion of close relatives there remained a total of 380 available for frequency analysis. These comprised a sample of 239 Ogoni from villages between 10 and 40 miles east, and a sample of 141 Abua from villages about 25 miles west, of Port Harcourt.
Testing was done with the thirteenth (1958) edition of Ishihara's Tests for Colour Blindness. The incorporation of six new plates in this edition considerably increased the usefulness of these tests for examining peoples not accustomed to reading numerals. The illiterate subject is merely asked to trace the course of a line winding across each of 13 colored cards. His performance in the different tasks indicates whether he

has normal color vision, or suffers from total color blindness, red or green blindness, or an incomplete color defect. The Ishihara test, like other pseudo-isochromatic tests, has its drawbacks; there are no charts for tritanomalous vision and, since fine discrimination (such as may be obtained by quantitative analyses from anomaloscope investigations) is impossible, differentiation of less serious degrees of color defect is not distinct, so that genetic analysis is limited unless the results can be amplified by those from other more intricate methods of examination. But it is not easy to employ an anomaloscope in the field with illiterate subjects whom one has to question and instruct through an interpreter who may have a quite different color terminology and concept of matching colors. On the other hand the Ishihara test is easily applied under these conditions, since most primitive people are acquainted with snakes and the observer can watch the ease or otherwise with which a subject traces the winding course of the "snake" across the page; it is one of the most successful of the simple tests for detecting the existence of a red/green defect (Belcher et al., 1958; Wright, 1957), erring if anything towards severity; it gives comparable results in the hands of different investigators; it has been widely employed so that comparative material is accumulating; arid for work in the field it is a useful tool, inexpensive and compact. The tests were carried out with the Ishihara cards by daylight either indoors or in deep shade

outside; illumination as indicated by a Weston exposure meter was very similar in both conditions.
RESULTS
The results of the tests are summarized in Table 1. No individuals were found who suffered from total color blindness. Differentiation between normal and defective was quite clear; only in the case of the subject classified as incompletely color blind was there any doubt. A subject was recorded as normal if, out of the 13 plates, he did not make more than two errors (either by tracing the line of the incorrect color or mistaking the course of the line); the majority of errors made by the normal subjects occurred in plates 36 and 37, in which many were able to see both lines. Those classified as color blind made at least six errors in plates 30-37, and had little difficulty in tracing plates 28 and 29; all were able to trace only one of the two lines in plates 26 and 27, and upon which line was chosen depended the diagnosis of red or green defect. The subject classi-

fied as "incomplete" successfully followed both lines in plates 26 and 27 despite errors in plates 30-37. The subjects with red/green defects were not sufficiently numerous to indicate any differences in incidence with age, for they were regularly distributed throughout the age groups. As is usually observed, green defects are of more frequent occurrence than red. The overall low incidence of red/green defects is very similar in the two groups and the slight difference is of course not statistically significant.
DISCUSSION
Although red/green color blindness was one of the first genetic characters to be identified in man, and has been one of the most extensively studied human examples of multiple allelism, it still presents a number of problems. As regards the genetics of the condition, it has been postulated that the gene for normal color vision is dominant over those responsible for the different degrees of red/green blindness, while the gene giv-

ing rise to a slight anomaly is dominant over that producing the more extreme red or green form; incomplete dominance however sometimes occurs. Two series of multiple alleles are probably involved in red/green blindness, one series being responsible for the red defects, the other for the green; the two series occur at different loci on the X-chromosome (Franceschetti and Klein, 1957), close to that governing glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, but not to that for the Xg blood groups. The phenotypic manifestation of these traits varies slightly with age (Chapanis, 1950; Lakowski, 1958), and environmental conditions (Hamilton et al., 1944). Yet, while knowledge of its inheritance is extensive, the biological significance of red/green color blindness, the advantages anddisadvantages it confers in evolution, has remained speculative, though the importance of good color vision is attested by its independent appearance on several occasions during evolution, among insects, fishes, reptiles and birds, but in no mammals except the higher primates.
The present results illustrate the type of problem requiring consideration.

Here the subjects examined experience light conditions quite different from those of the savana of northern Nigeria, yet the occurrence of color blindness in 8 out of 380 subjects (an overall frequency of 2.11%) is very similar to that found in the Hausa populations (11out of 609 subjects), studied by the same investigator using the same test cards, but who are very different in their genetic constitution from the forest peoples of the present study. How to account for this uniformity? It appears to hold throughout Africa south of the Sahara. This is shown by drawing together the data for red/green blindness in African populations that have been recorded by various observers during the last 25years using comparable techniques, all except one employing the Ishihara cards (Table 2). Among 537 Baganda at Kampala there were 10 cases (1.86%) (Simon, 1951); in Ruanda Urundi, among 1,000 Bahutu and 1,000 Batutsi there were respectively 27 and 25 cases (2.70 and 2.50%) (Hiernaux and van der Borght, 1953); there occurred 16 individuals (1.72%) in a sample of 929Congo Bantu at Leopoldville and Costermansville

(Appelmanns et al., 1953); there were 12 cases (2.95%) in a sample of 407 Bechuana (Squires, 1942), though perhaps this Bechuana sample is not strictly comparable with the remainder since Ishihara tests were not applied; among the Hausa populations examined the frequencies were 1.90% and 1.69% in Habe and Fulani respectively, and in a third Hausa group it was 1.59% (Roberts, 1962); in southwest Nigeria a small sample of 60 Yoruba adults at Ibadan showed 2 cases (3.37%); in northwest Tanganyika there were 2 cases out of 123 (Hangaza and Bushubi 1.63%), and in East Kenya 5 cases out of 198 (Roberts and Tanner, 1967). Each of these investigations referred to males. Widely scattered throughout the continent and drawn from a diversity of habitats as these samples are, there is remarkable homogeneity in the incidence of red/green color blindness--the differences between them are not statistically significant, and of course the incidences in the two samples in the present survey (2.09 and 2.13%) agree closely with all of them. This apparent homogeneity over the whole continent of sub-Saharan Africa suggests that the problem of the biological significance of the trait may be complex.
There is little doubt that normal color vision, with the increased quality and quantity of visual information it endows, must confer some advantage on its possessor over the color-blind individual, an advantage varying in degree with habitat and way of life of the population concerned. The nature of this advantage is suggested in one of the earliest literary references (Huddard, 1777) to a colorblind man, who was unable to distinguish ripe cherries among foliage. Polyak (1957) pointed out the importance of color vision to primitive human groups and particularly to females, in food gathering, in the choice of fruit which is

neither under- nor over-ripe, in hunting, and in the recognition of enemies by color. Pickford (1963) speculated on the degrees of handicap imposed by the different degrees of color defect. He suggested that protanopia is the most severe, because in it black is confused with dark reds and browns, greens are confused with light reds and browns, purples are confused with blues, and pink with skyblue, and these would be particularly severe in food seeking activities at dusk or dawn, when red fruits or brown animals would be confused with shadows by protans more than by deutans. Severe protanomaly would come next in severity, and then probably deuteranopia, while the least disabling forms of color blindness would be simple protanomaly and deuteranomaly. In the light of the disadvantage that it carries, why then does color blindness occur at measurable frequencies at all in human populations?
It may be that the polymorphism is balanced, the advantage that color vision possesses in normal individuals being balanced by some other advantage in the male color-blind hemizygote and the female defective homozygote. Such an advantage, it has been suggested, may lie in the ability of the color-blind to uncover cryptic colorations, and particularly of enemies; this ability is well shown if one collects caterpillars of the emperor moth in company with a colorblind entomologist (Ford, 1955). But it seems unlikely that the usefulness of the gene will be constant in magnitude in the various habitats from which the African samples have been drawn. It may be that the polymorphism is balanced in some other way, by some advantage of the female heterozygote about which nothing is currently known since she can rarely be distinguished from normal by present methods. Whatever the nature of the balance, the equilibrium

gene frequencies will depend on the relative degrees of the respective advantages, assuming mutation rates are constant. But, in either case, it hardly seems likely that variations in the usefulness of the trait will be so exactly counterbalanced by corresponding relative disadvantages as to maintain the frequency at a uniform level everywhere throughout the African continent. Perhaps the primary selective factors balancing the polymorphism should be sought among those operating extrinsically on a continental scale--for example, geographical factors common to all environments throughout the continent--or some intrinsic race specific factor, depending on the other characteristics of the genome of Africans, as Nijenhuis (1966) has recently argued in the case of blood-group frequencies.
But perhaps this is not a case of balanced polymorphism, for other explanations are possible. A conspicuous feature of the world distribution of red/ green color blindness frequencies, as is so clearly shown by the critical compilation of Kherumian and Pickford (1959), who have included only surveys acceptable on grounds of technique and internal consistency, are the marked differences between continental groups of man. For instance the incidence of red/ green defects in African populations is consistently and markedly lower than in Eastern Asians, and in these it is lower than in Europeans who have the highest general incidence of any indigenous human continental group. The African low incidence is comparable with that observed in Melanesians (though there are occasional settlements with higher incidence) (Geddes, 1946), Australian aborigines, and Papuans (Mann and Turner, 1956), all of whom are heavily pigmented peoples; the only other groups with a low incidence are some Eskimo (Skeller, 1954), and North Amer-

ican Indians (Clements, 1930; Garth, 1933). Such a distribution is compatible with the hypothesis that the red/green color blindness genes are today selectively neutral, the differences between continents stemming from the time when they were not, and the slight differences within continents being due to random variation in gene frequency. Unfortunately this convenient hypothesis merely puts the problem one stage further back in time.
Alternatively, perhaps there is no advantage attaching today to the color blindness genes, which are instead mildly deleterious relative to their normal alleles. In this case perhaps the losses of the color blindness genes through selection against them in color-blind males and homozygotic females are balanced by mutation to them, and it is variations in the intensity of selection against them, in the face of constant mutation pressure, that are responsible for the observed differences in gene frequency. Pickford (1958) suggested that color blindness might tend to be eliminated by natural selection less in civilised man than in primitives, and as Post (1962) has argued there is indeed an increase in frequency from the more primitive groups to the Europeans which may represent a diminution or relaxation of selection pressure against the color blindness genes in those of more advanced culture. In this case assume that the population here studied is in equilibrium with respect to the red and green blindness loci, in which selection against color-blind males is balanced by mutation to the defect. Assume that there is no inbreeding, and regard all types of red defect as under the control of a single gene, and all types of green defect likewise. The gene frequencies' are respectively .005(26) and .013(16). For a sex-linked gene such a balance is

achieved when q=3u/s, where q is the gene frequency, u the mutation rate and s the selection coefficient. Reasonable limits for mutation rates may be obtained from Penrose's (1961) summary of rates for other characters in man. For the deuteranopic gene, if u is set as high as 50 per million, then s is .0114; if u isset as low as 5 per million, then s is .00114. For the gene determining red blindness, for the same mutation rates, the values of s are respectively .0285 and .00285. These figures suggest that, for the protanopic gene at least, this hypothesismay be testable by family studies in a population of adequate size but sufficiently low color blindness gene frequencies, such as that investigated here.
As frequency data on red/green color blindness have accumulated on human populations, the problem of accounting for their differences and similarities has emerged. The present discussion has suggested that there are several previously proposed hypotheses which may be acceptable. But it is hardly justifiable to accept any one of these hypotheses while so much remains to be learned of other possible biological effects of possessionof the red/green color blindness genes.
SUMMARY
Frequencies of red-green color blindness are given in samples of two African populations from the Niger delta. Various hypotheses accounting for the differences and similarities in frequencies observed in human populations are discussed.
