THE MEDICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF DATE OF BIRTH

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:29 08 December 2015

JOHN C. BAILAR III and JOAN GURIAN 

Although there have been many scattered reports purporting to link month or season of birth with such diverse afflictions as cogenital defects, mental deficiency, and cancer, the significance of date of birth has been of serious concern to very few medical and scientific research workers. Some of the reasons for this neglect are that the subject matter seems slightly disreputable to many scientists, that the field has attracted an undue proportion of enthusiasts and faddists, and that results, when carefully examined, have usually been disappointing. Yet there remain a few valid reasons for seeking correlations between date of birth and the occurrence of certain medical conditions. A simple example is provided by the well-known correlation between maternal infections with rubella and the genesis of congenital defects. Since rubella is most common during late winter and early spring, and since it exerts its most harmful effects on 3-month fetuses, one might expect an elevated incidence of congenital malformations among infants born in the late summer and early fall. A seasonal pattern has in fact been observed for some congenital malformations, although it has not been directly linked to specific maternal diseases.
Some acquaintance with the scattered literature on correlations between birth date and certain diseases has led us to prepare the following review of results reported during the past three decades. Reports published before 1935 are gen-

erally omitted since they were reviewed by Huntington (1938), an enthusiastic believer in the effect of season of birth on many facets of human development and ability. A few new graphs have been prepared to supplement published material.
We have not generally indicated in the text our evaluation of each of the papers cited, because nearly all can be faulted for at least one major error in procedure or interpretation. There is, however, a single section at the end of the review in which the most common and most important errors and méthodologie problems have been brought together for unified discussion.
This review is presented with the hope of pointing out some of the méthodologie problems in studying correlations between month or season of birth and various medical conditions stimulating more careful study of the few areas where there is some reason to expect significant results.
DATE OF CONCEPTION AND BIRTH
Seasonal variations in birth rate and in the mortality of newborn infants affect the number of persons who were born in various months and are now subject to the risk of developing specified conditions. The high correlation between date of conception and date of birth makes it difficult or impossible to separate their effects; we shall not attempt to do so except in a later section on prematurity. However, Erhardt and associates (19G5) have emphasized the importance of making this distinction when the data permit.
In the United States, births are most

common (after adjustment for the number of days in each month) in August and September, and least common in April and May. There is a minor peak in February and a small dip in November. The range of variation is from about eight percent below the annual average to eight percent above average. This pattern is found throughout the United States, but there are some differences by geographic area and race. Nonwhite birth rates show somewhat greater month-to-month fluctuation than white birth rates, and for both the white and nonwhite population the variations are larger in the South than elsewhere. Variations were greater during 1948-54 than in 1933-40, and in some parts of the country the late summer peak has been delayed about one month in recent years. The male-female ratio at birth is slightly higher during May through July than in the rest of the year. Seasonal cycles in the U.S. birth rates have been summarized by Rosenberg (1966).
Otto and his associates (Noack and Otto, 1957; Otto, 1959, 1960), investigating birth rates in Germany and Switzerland since 1872, have found an aboveaverage number of births during January through June, with a slight peak in September; the excess was greater for illegitimate than for legitimate infants and for first-born than for later infants. On the other hand, Belavalgidad (1963) in New Delhi, found an excess of births occurring during the last six months of the year. Still other patterns have been reported from other areas.
These seasonal variations have been attributed both to biologic and social factors such as month-to-month variations in marriage rate, physical activity, and general health, and to environmental changes such as average amount of daylight, outdoor or indoor temperature, and humidity. None of these have

been directly shown to affect human conception or birth rates, although some suggestive evidence is at hand or could easily be obtained. For instance, a seasonal change in the proportion of plural births would suggest the influence of physical or biological cycles distinct from seasonal changes in exposure to conception. Edwards (1938) studied very limited data on the ratio of plural births to single births and concluded that this ratio does show a seasonal trend different from that for total births; this finding should be verified on other data before it is fully accepted.
Another factor that could affect seasonal birth patterns is fetal survival. High fetal mortality during certain seasons would naturally lower birth rates some months later. Hewitt (1962) found above-average fetal mortality (births expected 6 to 7 months later) in February through June and in October, as did Belavalgidad (1963). Pasamanick, Dinitz, and Knobloch (1960) studied various factors affecting birth rates by month and concluded that the data are consistent with either decreased fertility in the summer or increased fetal mortality slightly later in the year.
The State of Connecticut has published annual tabulations of births by month for over 100 years (Connecticut State Department of Health, annually). Despite great changes in many characteristics of the population such as occupation, living habits, and population density and distribution these data show a fairly stable seasonal pattern of birth rates (Figure 1). However, Otto (1959) found an increasing proportion of summer births in Germany during the past 90 years.
Some of the difficulties of studying the effect of season on birth rates, and various explanations for the trends ob-

served, were discussed by Huntington (1938).
COMPLICATIONS OF PREGNANCY
Many complications of pregnancy are known to affect fetuses and they may sometimes cause death or lasting damage. If these complications are more common in some months than in others, this could be reflected in a seasonal pattern of incidence for such disorders as cerebral palsy, mental deficiency, congenital malforma-

tions, or prematurity. The relationship between complications of pregnancy and time of year has received relatively little careful study, although scattered reports indicate some significant correlations.
The few published studies on eclampsia (Eufinger and Weikersheimer, 1933; Franco and Onnis, 1957; Harrar, 1936; Hauch and Lehmann, 1934; Pasamanick and Knobloch, 1958; Tottenham, 1933) suggest an increased incidence of eclampsia in the winter and early spring. Sev-

eral authors (Eufinger and Weikersheimer, 1933; Alfieri, quoted by Franco and Onnis, 1957) believe that the increase of eclampsia in these months was not accompanied by similar increase in pre-eclampsia. Further work will be needed to draw general conclusions about other complications of pregnancy, such as hyperemosis, cystopyelitis, and uterine bleeding (Franco and Onnis, 1957; Kleine, 1941; Otto and Glaas, 1959; Pasamanick and Knobloch, 1958; de Rudder, 1952) and to determine whether these are in part related to variations in the health of infants.
DURATION OF PREGNANCY
Several early studies agreed in showing that pregnancies resulting in summer births were, on the average, several days longer than those resulting in winter births (Bernhart, 1938; Censi, 1932; Guthman and Knos, 1937; von Khreniger-Guggenberger and Schurrer, 1932; Kustner, 1931; Noack and Otto, 1957; Otto and Glaas, 1959). Various ingenious explanations were advanced for these fairly consistent seasonal differences. However, other authors have found an opposite correlation (Hewitt, 1961; von Winkel, cited by Wahl, 1938) or no correlation at all (Horst, cited by Wahl, 1938; von Knorre, 1933). Wahl (1938) studied over 4,000 spontaneous term births and showed that under the usual rule of thumb for calculating expected date of delivery (nine months and seven days from the beginning of the last menstrual period) there appeared to be a three day excess in the length of pregnancies terminating in the summer when compared with those terminating in the winter. However, he also gave figures adjusted for variation in length of month; the summer-winter difference nearly disappeared. It would be helpful

to know whether previous writers had also counted the number of days in each pregnancy. Record and Leek (1963) have discussed some of the other problems in determining the exact length of gestation. Relationship between season and prematurity have received limited attention (Bivins, cited by Huntington, 1938; Katz, 1953; Noack and Otto, 1957; Otto, 1960; Siani, 1937), and no general conclusions are possible.
The scanty and conflicting evidence does not permit any generalizations regarding seasonal variations in either the duration of term pregnancies or prematurity rates. If such variations do exist, they are either small enough to escape detection with the methods that have been used for analysis, or they vary from one area or population to another in such a way as to obscure the underlying patterns.
INFANT MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY
It is generally agreed that infant mortality and morbidity from respiratory infections is lower in the summer than in other seasons, but that this is more or less balanced by a summer peak in gastrointestinal diseases. The relative importance of these two cycles varies from place to place and from time to time, so that the highest infant mortality and morbidity rates for all causes combined may come in any season. Deaths from winter respiratory infections and summer diarrheas no longer present the threat which they once did, but there are still significant month-to-month variations in stillbirths and in the mortality of newborn and very young infants (Anon, 1943; Eastman, 1945; Hewitt, 1963; Otto, 1960; Pankaama and Räihä, 1957; Sinkko, 1937).
Figure 2 summarizes recent infant mortality data for the United States.

The official tabulations from which the data were drawn (National Vital Statistics Division, annually) aregiven by date of death rather than date of birth. However, most of thedeaths occurring before 28 days of age actually occur in the first two days, so it seems reasonable here to accept month of death as month of birth.
The greatest number of deaths before the ageof 28 days occurred in July, two months before thepeak birth rate. However, rough adjustment for variations in births shows that thehighest infant mortality rate occurred among those born in May andJune. A comparison of mortality attributed to four broad causes of death--congenital malformations, immaturity alone, immaturity with other conditions of early infancy, and all other causes of death (primarily birth injuries, postnatal asphyxia, pneumonia, and hemolytic disease)--is given in Figure 3, which shows the relative level of infant

mortality for each of these causes. While it is often difficult to determine causes of infant mortality, it seems unlikely that there could be reporting errors which would create fictitious seasonal cycles for specific groups of causes. Comparison of Figure 3 with the birth curve in Figure 2 suggests that the May-June peak in 28day mortality rates is the result of a large excess of deaths associated with prematurity in late spring and early summer, while mortality from congenital malformations and from "all other causes" is nearly constant. If adjustment were made for the short gestation period of immature infants, these peaks inmortality associated with immaturity would be somewhat smaller and would probably correspond to conception dates in October and November.
The patterns observed in mortality from prematurity (Fig. 3) do not necessarily imply a higher incidence inMay

and June. It may be that prematurity rates areconstant from month to month, but that prematurity or its associated conditions is more often fatal in the late spring and early summer than at other times.
Only the most severe diseases of infancy are reflected in mortality figures. There have been several attempts to determine the importance of other indices of illness or impairment, especially fever and weight loss of newborns. Despite conflicting patterns in various geographic areas and time periods (Adair and Stewart, 1926; Bakwin and Bakwin, 1929; Meredith andBrown, 1939; Salber, 1956; Tyson, 1927), results suggest that further work may beof value.
The subject of neonatal illness and death in relation to season seems to have almost disappeared from themedical literature. Further study might lead to the

identification of maternal or fetal factors associated with observed seasonal variations in infant mortality and morbidity from certain illnesses, notably prematurity.
SIZE AT BIRTH, GROWTH, AND DEVELOPMENT
The older medical literature is sprinkled with occasional references toseasonal variation in the average height and weight of newborn infants and in their subsequent growth and development. Sanders (1934) reviewed the early literature on this subject and concluded that the evidence suggested, but did not conclusively demonstrate, some increase in birth size in late summer and early fall. More recent studies have often agreed in showing summer births to result in heavier babies than winter births

(Bivins, cited by Huntington, 1938; Dupin, Masse, and Correa, 1962; Li, 1963, but there have been some reports (Brenton, 1922; Kustner, 1931; Noack and Otto, 1957; Otto, 1960; Pasamanick and Knobloch, 1958; Salber and Bradshaw, 1952) that babies born in the summer are lighter than average, at least in certain segments of the population. Studies of postnatal growth and development in relation to birth date have also been inconclusive and contradictory (Chenowith and Canning, 1941; Fitt, 1941, 1955; Mills, 1941; Porter and Baird, 1927; Schiotz, 1937). The divergence in observed patterns may be due to such things as local variations in maternal activity or employment during pregnancy, climate, or diet, as well as to unrecognized biases in the selection of persons for study.
CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS
The extensive literature on congenital malformations and season of birth has recently been reviewed (Bailar and Gurian, 1965), so only brief comment will be made here. Seasonal cycles in the occurrence of several congenital malformations have been demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt. These malformations include anencephaly, patent ductus arteriosus, and congenital dislocation of the hip. It is especially interesting that these three malformations also share the unusual characteristic of being more common in girls than in boys, and there is suggestive evidence that the seasonal pattern in patent ductus arteriosus, at least, may be confined to girls. Reasons for these seasonal cycles and for possible differences by sex are unknown, and much work remains to be done.
INTELLIGENCE AND MENTAL ILLNESS
Reported correlations between intelligence and birth date have attracted more

popular attention than any other facet of this subject. Three statistical approaches have been used to search for significant variations: studies of birth date of persons attaining distinctions which are in some way related to ability or intelligence; studies of persons with mongolism or other forms of mental deficiency; and studies of intelligence test scores of persons in the presumably "normal" or "average" populations. Although workers in this field have not always clearly differentiated between these three approaches, there seems to be no reason for which they must all show the same cyclic patterns, if in fact any exist. They will be discussed separately.
Petersen (cited by Huntington, 1938) and Huntington (1938) studied entries in various directories of eminent persons and concluded that persons who achieve unusual success show an exceptional tendency to be born in winter; Pintner and Forlano (1934) made a similar study but detected no convincing pattern by birth month.
It seems reasonable to assume that among persons admitted to colleges or universities, a relatively high proportion are of superior ability, and that seasonal patterns of birth date might correspond to those reported for eminent persons. Of two reports investigating the distribution of birth date of college students, one (Mills, 1941) found the greatest number in late autumn, while another (Chenowith and Canning, 1941) found the preponderance during June through September. The latter also shows that students born in December through January had above-average scores on psychological examination (unspecified, not I.Q.), but below-average college grades, while two other reports (Forlando and Ehrlich, 1941; Held, 1940) showed that students born in the spring or summer scored

96

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:29 08 December 2015

slightly higher on psychological tests than those born in the other seasons.
Studies of birth date among persons with below-average intelligence (Blonsky, Looft cited by Huntington, 1938; Knobloch and Pasamanick, 1958; Pintner and Forlano, 1939; Schachter and Cotte, 1947) suggest that subnormal intelligence may be less common or less severe in persons born in the spring than in other seasons. A possible effect of climate on mental deficiency is suggested by data from the southern hemisphere (Pintner and Forlano, 1939) showing a six month difference in cycle corresponding to the difference in climatic season, and by a finding of Knobloch and Pasamanick (1958) that rates for first hospital admission of children with subnormal intelligence were higher among persons born in years when the mean summer temperature was higher than usual than among children born after cooler summers. Sterling (1960) has discussed many of the biases and méthodologie pitfalls encountered in work of this type; the most important are noted in the Methodologie Problems section that follows.
Four reports (Collmann and Stoller, 1962; Edwards, 1961b; 0ster, 1953; Playdell, 1957) on mongolism by month of birth have shown, respectively, no seasonal pattern, a peak in May through July, a peak in April, and two peaks in April and October. Lander et al. (1964) have emphasized the problems of finding a suitable control population.
Knobloch and Pasamanick (1962) have provided a review of recent work on seasonal and other factors related to mental subnormality.
Correlations between season of birth and intelligence in the "normal" population have been studied with more care and diligence than such correlations in the superior and subnormal populations,

although all three fields now receive less attention than they did two or three decades ago.
Pintner and Forlano (1943) reviewed seven series of intelligence tests on "normal" populations. Six of these seven series showed the lowest mean intelligence score for persons born in the autumn or winter. In most cases the difference between high and low season was very small (on the order of one or two I.Q. points). Pintner and Forlano (1943) also reviewed the many explanations which had been offered for differences in intelligence by month of birth. These included seasonal variations in temperature, sunlight, date of weaning, infant mortality with selective removal of impaired children, infant morbidity with selective damage of the survivors, average age at school entrance, seasonal differences in birth rate by ethnic group, selective planning of births by more intelligent parents, and a "basic animal rhythm."
Roberts (1944) also reviewed the early literature on intelligence and season of conception. He accepts a correlation between summer conception (spring birth) and below-average intelligence but attributes this to a tendency of more intelligent parents to have an above-average proportion of babies during the winter months. This conclusion is supported by his finding, based on a small sample, that the seasonal difference in intelligence vanishes when winter-born children are compared with their own summer-born brothers and sisters.
It is not possible to evaluate here all the various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain on physical or biological bases the observed differences in intelligence or achievement by month of birth. It is sufficient to note that they have been numerous, contradictory, and often supported by a train of impeccable

logic based on very doubtful premises. While the existence of small differences is now fairly well established, it seems most likely that they are due to seasonal differences in birth rate of various parental classes or to other selective factors, rather than to more direct effects of date of conception or birth.
There have been scattered reports (Lang, 1931; Pile, 1951; Sauvage Nolting, 1934, 1939, 1951, 1964, 1965; Tramer, 1929, 1944) that mental illness, as well as mental deficiency is related to month of birth. This question, like many others concerning month of birth, must remain open until more extensive data are available and subjected to careful examination.
OTHER DISEASES
There have been attempts to link month or season of birth with the incidence of several diseases usually appearing among older children or adults. These have generally met with indifferent success.
Loxton and Gold (1961) found a high relative incidence of rheumatoid arthritis among persons born September through February; this difference was statistically significant but needs verification from other sources.
Miller (1963) in a comprehensive survey of distant visual acuity loss in nearly 7,000 Japanese children in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, found a possible correlation between spring birth and the subsequent appearance of myopia.
Lang (1929) found a moderately large excess of goiter among persons born in the first quarter or first half of the year.
Data on the incidence of tuberculosis (Ehrlich, 1947; Petersen, cited by Huntington, 1938; Huntington, 1938; Stur, 1953) and cancer (Bailar and Gurian, 1964; Ederer et al., 1965; Dijkstra, 1963;

Maurer and Wendt, 1958; Sauvage Nolting, 1966; Stur, 1953) in relation to month of birth are contradictory but it is likely that no significant variations exist for either disease, with the possible exception of cancers occurring in the first year of life.
Average length of life, or longevity, may be considered an index of mortality from all causes combined. There seems to have been no published report of longevity in relation to month of birth since Huntington (1938) found that persons born from January through March or April live somewhat longer than those born from July through September.
METHODOLOGIC PROBLEMS
Formidable methodologic problems arise in attempting to correlate various diseases with date of birth. They may be grouped into four overlapping categories: biases in case collection, errors in determining the population from which the cases were drawn, improper application of statistical tests, and lack of care in framing questions to be answered.
In searching for variations in season of birth, comparisons are always made (at least implicitly) between incidence rates or relative ratios for the different birth date categories. Valid rates or ratios require reasonably accurate determination of both numerators (the numbers of cases observed in each category) and denominators (the number or proportion of persons in each category who could develop the condition). It is not possible to list here all the possible biases in determining the number of cases born in each month or season, but two examples will illustrate the problem.
First, studies of intelligence and month of birth have for the most part ignored social class variations in seasonal birth patterns, although there is some

98

evidence for such differences. For example, upper socio-economic groups have been found to have a somewhat elevated spring (Goodenough, 1941) or winter (Pasamanick et al., 1960) birth rate when compared with lower socio-economic groups. Comparing birth date of college entrants (who are more likely than average to come from upper socio-economic groups) with birth date in the general population, rather than with persons from similar family backgrounds, could therefore lead to incorrect conclusions. A similar source of error was noted by Preston (1942), who discussed urbanrural differences in birth patterns and showed that adjustment for such differences destroyed the systematic pattern in college matriculation which Mills (1941) reported.
A second example of possible bias is provided by a study of the height and weight of 20,000 young men (Fitt, 1955). The men were examined for an army draft, but the author does not state whether his sample included all men registered, or only those inducted. If the latter was the case, the height and weight cycles that were reported could be explained by the differential removal from the population of persons with various conditions associated with body size above or below normal, such as mental deficiency, congenital defects, or deferral for the completion of college work. Variation in socio-economic class, if correlated with both birth date and body size, could also be important here.
Problems in determining populations at risk of developing various medical conditions are probably easier to recognize, but they may be very difficult to resolve. In studying month of birth of cancer patients, for example, it is clear that an assumption of uniform distribution of births in the general population would be unwarranted, even if adjust-

ment is made for the varying number of days per month. Adjustment to the number of births in each month might be better, but most cancer patients are middle-aged or older and birth patterns may have changed in recent years. In addition, the study population may include many persons migrating from areas with different natality patterns. Adjustment to the number of births per month as reported several decades ago could be hazardous because these births do not reflect current survivors (Figure 2). The possible effects of some of these problems have been discussed elsewhere (Kesselman and Bailar, 1964).
Improper application of statistical significance tests is common, but unfortunately some of the most serious misapplications do not lend themselves to brief exposition in nontechnical terms. Such problems include the testing of hypotheses on fragments of data, the post hoc stating of hypotheses to be treated, and confounding hypotheses. A recent paper by Sterling (1960) should be consulted for an explanation of these. Edwards (1961a) has reviewed methods of fitting mathematical curves to cyclic trends.
Much of the published work on month or season of birth has suffered from a lack of care in designing studies and in framing questions to be answered. It is possible, for example, that some of the work on duration of pregnancy was in fact concerned with deviations from expected date of delivery as determined from a rule of thumb, rather than with the actual number of days gestation (see section entitled Duration of Pregnancy, and Record and Leek, 1963). More common, and more serious, are problems related to sample size. It is not generally appreciated that very large samples may be required to demonstrate small annual cycles. No specific guidelines can be given, but an adequate search for a sea-

sonal fluctuation of ten percent inthe frequency of a given condition would probably require at least 10,000 cases. Larger fluctuations could of course be found with more modest samples.
A less obvious problem in study design arose in thework of Mills (1941) oncollege admissions. As he pointed out, young persons are less likely to beready for matriculation at the beginning of the academic year if their birthdays arejust passed than if they are several months older; his data reflect this bias most strongly at ages 15 and 16 but it may still be present at age 19. It also seems possible that a decreased probability of college admission at a specific age may not be entirely compensated by an increased probability in later years. This could cause all or part of thebirth date cycles reported among noted men by limiting the advanced education available to certain birth-month cohorts.
Another type of problem is illustrated by the finding (Bailar and Gurian, 1961) that theaverage age at death of persons born in May and June was about one year less than for those born in February and March; this was true even when infant mortality was excluded. This observation, being an average age, is free of thevarious biases in determining numbers of deaths per month. However, it does depend on the distribution of birth date in thegeneral population. Changing birth patterns or other factors could result in different age distribution for persons born in different months. Their average ages at death might then differ, even if they have identical agespecific mortality rates.
This catalog of problems arising in the study of season of birth should not unduly discourage further work when there are specific reasons for seeking correlations between birth date and various conditions. The publications of afew

investigators, especially those dealing with congenital malformations, show that careful work and thoughtful evaluation of the results are not impossible, and that they may lead to useful results.
SUMMARY
There is clear evidence of month-tomonth variation in infant mortality and in the occurrence of several congenital malformations including anencephaly, patent ductus arteriosus, and congenital dislocation of the hip. In addition, there is suggestive evidence for seasonal cycles in births of persons with several other conditions arising during fetal life or early infancy. Thedata at hand do not suggest that further examination of birth-date cycles in relation to diseases appearing in older children or adults holds much promise. Much more work is needed onthe observed association between date of birth andcongenital malformations, particularly with respect to sex ratio and to seasonal variations in specific noxious stimuli which might injure developing fetuses, such as maternal infections or ingestion of various foods and drugs.
A large amount of effort has been expended on the study of date of birth and various conditions of medical interest, but relatively few such correlations have been found and adequately confirmed. There exist a few careful and soberly evaluated studies in this general field of endeavor. They should be used as models for future work.
