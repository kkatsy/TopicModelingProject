INBREEDING LEVELS IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES*

NEWTON FREIRE-MAIA
Laboratory of Genetics, Faculty of Philosophy University of Paraná Curitiba, Pr, Brazil

ONE OF THE PARAMETERS ENTERING INTO the general theory of the structure of populations is the inbreeding rate (Wright, 1922, 1951).
In man the value of this parameter is determined not only by physical but also by cultural and socio-economic factors. As a consequence, the estimation of rates of inbreeding is of interest to population geneticists, physical as well as cultural anthropologists, and sociologists; moreover, the ultimate elucidation of the factors controlling rates of inbreeding in man will require the talents of all of these disciplines.
It is doubtful whether inbreeding plays as important a role in modern human populations as it played in primitive societies or in the structuring of populations of most other animal species. This notion stems from two facts. First, human populations are, in the main, characterized by the avoidance of mating between the closest of relatives. Second, contemporary human populations have themselves been derived from more inbred populations of the past. The first of these tends to reduce enormously the inbreeding rates, and the second reduces the overall effect of inbreeding on the frequency of homozygosity for deleterious, recessive genes, genes which will have been heavily exposed to the action of natural selection in the past (for a

discussion of this second problem, see Haldane, 1939). These facts notwithstanding, human populations are the only "natural" populations for which reasonably reliable estimates of inbreeding exist.
In spite of the fact that a considerable amount of energy has been expended in efforts to characterize the mating behavior of man, surprisingly little data of value to the population geneticist exists. This is primarily due to the failure to quantitate observations. Thus, information that a particular group is largely inbred, or practices preferentially cross-cousin marriage, or discourages unions between close relatives, etc., has little value in the evaluation of inbreeding coefficients though these statements may have meaning for the cultural anthropologist.
This paper will summarize the data thus far collected on several contemporary human populations, and will attempt to indicate the rather striking differences which exist. No attempt will be made, however, to delineate the factors responsible for this wide divergence of inbreeding rates. European Countries
In Europe, data are available for a number of countries: for France (Boudin, 1862; Dally, 1864; Berdllon, 1872; Lacassagne, 1876; Stieda (1)»; Mulhal, 1892; MayoSmith, 1895; Wulz, 1925; Dahlberg, 1938;

Data for Portugal, based on official statistics, are presented in Table 1.
With a few exceptions, the frequency of first cousin marriages found in these countries is in the neighborhood of one per cent. Some of the exceptions are to be found in Scotland, where villages with frequencies of 9 and 17 per cent are known; Norway, where it has been estimated that 7 per cent of marriages involve first cousins; a few communities in Germany and Switzerland where frequencies around 15 per cent have been encountered; and an isolated village in Sweden with a frequency of 7 per cent.
Asiatic Countries
Data are known for Japan (Kawakami, 1931 (4); Tsugawa, 1941 (4); Akimoto and Shiwazaki, 1941 (4); Neel, Kodani, Brewer and Anderson, 1949; Kida, Kanokogi, and Kojima, 1949; Schull, 1953) ; In-

United States and Canada
Some information regarding the U. S. population in the 18th and 19th centuries has been given by Dean (1903, (2) ) , who assumed first cousin marriages were about 0.5 per cent of the total in Iowa, and Arner (1908), who, by using the method developed by G. H. Darwin (1875a), estimated the frequency of first cousin marriages in 18th century New York to have been 2.76 per cent, in a 19th century county in Ohio

to have been 1.12 per cent, and in a large genealogy including about 7,500 marriages to be 1.07 per cent. Arner assumed a rate of 0.5 per cent for the total of the "more progressive American communities." Estabrook and McDougle (1926), in an analysis of a tri-racial isolate in Virginia, revealed that since the late 18th century, 7.23 per cent of the marriages were between first cousins, 4.82 per cent between first cousins once removed, and 7.83 per cent between second cousins. The incidence of consanguineous marriages up to and including fourth cousins was 49.40 per cent. Nofirst cousin marriage has, however, been recorded among the 44 marriages contracted during the last two generations.
Information r e g a r d i n g contemporary American populations has been given by Glass (1950) and Steinberg (1950, 1956). A detailed analysis of the situation among the Mormons and their relatives, who show, as a whole, inbreeding rates at the same extremely low levels of the non-Mormon populations (about 0.05 per cent first cousin marriage) has been made by Woolf, Stephens, Mulaik, and Gilbert (1956). Brown (1951) analyzed 107 marriages in a rural population in Kentucky and found an inbreeding pocket with 6.5 per cent of first cousin, 0.9 per cent of first cousin once removed, and 11.2 per cent of second cousin marriages. The total frequency up to and including fourth cousins was as high as38 per cent. Herndon and Kerley (1952)

studied another predominantly rural population in the mountains of North Carolina and found that from 1830to 1950 1.57per cent of marriages involved first cousins, and a total frequency through second cousins of 6.72 per cent. During the period 19101950, these frequencies were, respectively, about 0.6 and 4 per ¿ent. Compared tothe situation in the general population of the United States, even these rates can beconsidered as very high. This "high" frequency of first cousin marriages (0.06per cent), characteristic of a rural and somewhat isolated American population in the period 1910-1950, is similar to those found in Rio de Janeiro and Sâo Paulo, Brazil's largest urban centers, and in Buenos Aires and Montevideo, in recent times.
For Canada, the only data available refer to a small parish, St. Denis, where 4.5 per cent of the marriages involve relatives up to and including third cousins (Miner, 1939).
Argentina and Uruguay
Data from the Archdiocese of Buenos Aires, which includes only the city of Buenos Aires and the Martin Garcia Island, and from the Archdiocese of Montevideo, which encompasses six of the 19 Uruguayan departments, are presented in Table 2. The data are inadequate for an estimate of the total inbreeding level in Argentina as a whole. For Uruguay, however, as our data refer to about 50 per cent

Different shades correspond to different coefficients of inbreeding. The Viques Island (26) is not .presented at its real position.

of the whole population, it would appear that the frequency of first cousin marriages is in theneighborhood of 1 per cent.
Puerto Rico Puerto Rico is divided into two dioceses
of about equal size, San Juan and Ponce (cf. Figure 1). Theincidence of consanguineous marriages in each of the parishes of the Diocese of San Juan is given in Table 3; similar observations are not available for the Diocese of Ponce. Figure 1 shows the

distribution of the different inbreeding levels in the Diocese of San Juan.
Brazil
Tables 4-7 present data which, supplemented by data previously published (Freire-Maia, 1952, 1954, 1957a), afford a rather complete picture of the inbreeding levels obtaining throughout Brazil (Figure 2). The method of data collection and implications of these data have been presented inextenso elsewhere (Freire-Maia, 1952, 1957a,b).

Jamaica
No actual data are available on the inbreeding levels in this British Colony. Davenport and Steggerda (1929; pp. 14, 17, and 442) and Doran (1942) have asserted, however, that the frequency of consanguineous marriages is high. In Seaford Town, a high level of inbreeding is said to prevail. In this community there exists a white isolate of German origin. The genealogy of one of the families of this group, Kameka, has been given by Davenport and Steggerda (1929; plate 29, cf. their Table 332). Analysis of this genealogy affords some notion of the frequency of consanguineous marriages in this white isolate (Table 8). The original description of the pedigree is not particularly clear, and our estimates must be viewed as rough approximations of the actual inbreeding rate existent in the family.
Discussion: The Comparability of the Data
The methods which have been used to obtain data on inbreeding in different populations are sufficiently dissimilar that it is unlikely that the data are strictly comparable. In some instances, the entire popula-

tions of small communities have been studied, and, presumably, the data so obtained will yield a clear and trustworthy picture of the situation at that particular time in the history of the community. More frequently, it has been necessary to sample marriages, and consequently the data may or may not be representative of the true situation. Among the sampling procedures which have been employed are survey of physicians' families through a questionnaire published in a medical journal (Pearson, 1908a,b), hospital file analysis (Bell, 1940), students' families surveys (Kawa-

kami, 1931), home visits (Frota-Pessoa and Filkueiras, 1957), visit to homes with newly born children (Kilpatrick et al., 1955), pregnant women registration (Neel et al., 1949), analysis of genealogical charts (Ellis, 1936), survey of applicants for legal abortion (Romanus, 1953), official marriage records (Larsson and Sjögren, 1954), etc. A simple enumeration of these techniques is, in itself, sufficient to suggest that it is unlikely that the results of such surveys would be strictly comparable.
Another factor affecting the comparability of the information from different countries is the disparity in the number of regions or localities which have been sampled. Nations widely surveyed have a greater probability of presenting widespread variation in the local or regional inbreeding rates than those countries which have been studied only superficially. In addition, some data referring to "localities" include the surrounding rural areas and are not, there-

fore, comparable to information taken from strictly urban populations.
In some countries, official statistics provide information on the number of consanguineous marriages contracted each year, but the data so obtained underestimate the true population parameters (Serra, 1956). In Catholic countries, the data obtained through dispensations granted by ecclesiastical authorities to the canon impediments of consanguinity seem to be quite reliable, but they do not describe the inbreeding level of populations in a given time, but only the inbreeding level of a segment of these populations, namely, the fraction of the population which marries in a specific period. Thus, for example, Brazilian contemporary populations may show inbreeding levels as much as 20 per cent higher than those detected among recently contracted Catholic marriages. With official as well as Catholic data, an estimate of the inbreeding level of a population can be

obtained by indirect methods; these estimates are, of course, subject to a number of biases.
Conclusions
Table 9 summarizes the mean incidences of first cousin marriages detected in recent years in a number of countries. As has been pointed out, these data are not strictly comparable, and inferences from these data must be cautiously drawn. The following general conclusions can be drawn, however, from a consideration of Table 9:
1. The highest local rates of inbreeding are to be found in Brazil, Japan, India, and Israel. The Japanese mean frequency is, however, higher than the corresponding figure for Brazil. It is not clear how Japan would compare with Israel or India.
2. American populations are noteworthy in their extremely low inbreeding rates. The mean frequency of first cousin marriages in the United States is probably lower than 0.1 per cent.
3. Some localities in Puerto Rico and Sweden show "intermediate" inbreeding levels, being half-way between the extremes found in the U. S. and Brazil and Japan.
4. In several European countries, notably, Denmark, France, Italy, and North Ireland, the mean frequency of first cousin marriages is certainly less than 1 per cent. In England, Wales, Germany, and Holland, this frequency is probably lower than 0.5 per cent; whereas in Portugal, it may lie between 1 and 2 per cent.
5. Two Latin American countries, Uruguay and Puerto Rico, exhibit inbreeding rates lower than Brazil's. The frequency of first cousin marriages in Uruguay is probably in the neighborhood of 1 per cent.
Summary
A review is made of the general levels of inbreeding in contemporary populations of several countries. Data on Catholic marriages are presented for Brazil, Puerto Rico, Uruguay and Argentina. In addition, in-

formation based on official statistics is giv-
en for Portugal, Holland, and Italy.
Acknowledgments
I am especially indebted to the Bishops
and Priests of Brazil, Puerto Rico, Uru-
guay, and Argentina for providing the in-
formation on the incidence of consanguin-
eous marriages in a number of dioceses and
parishes in their countries, and for permit-
ting me, in many instances, to examine
their files.
I should also like to acknowledge my in-
debtedness to the organizations which pro-
vided funds for travel and bibliographic
studies (National Research Council of Bra-
zil, Rockefeller Foundation and CAPES);
to Drs. J. V. Neel, W. J. Schull, Flavio Re-
sende, and J. N. Spuhler; to A. Freire-Maia,
L. Sc, Miss G. Yesley, and Father Angelo
Serra, SJ; and to the Dutch and Italian Em-
bassies in Rio de Janeiro.
