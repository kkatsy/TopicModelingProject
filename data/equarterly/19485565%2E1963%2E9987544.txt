DELAYS IN CONCEPTION: A DISCREPANCY RE-EXAMINED
ROBERT G. POTTER, JR.,* CHARLES F. WESTOFF, and PHILIP C. SAGI

INTRODUCTION
CONCEPTION has elements of a chance event, and in any pregnancy interval a wide variation of conceptive delays may be expected. Even among regularly menstruating women, only a minority conceive the first month they try, and delays of a year or more are not uncommon. The matter has interest for demographers because, together with pregnancy wastage, involuntary delays of conception limit the extent to which birth intervals may be regulated. At the same time, a general description of conceptive delays has practical value for the physician, since it provides him with a standard by which to assess the conceptive performance of his patients.
Unfortunately, the two main sources of information about conceptive delays have yielded discrepant results. The average interval between marriage andfirst pregnancy in the reported absence of contraception typically exceeds by an appreciable margin the mean delay reported as following deliberate interruption of contraception (Westofï et al., 1961a). Successful contraceptors usually report delays averaging 5 or 6 months, with three-quarters to four-fifths of these wives becoming pregnant in 6 months and 90% within a year. Before contraception, delays of first conception average 10 or 11 months, with not quite twothirds of the women conceiving in the

first 6 months and only 80% pregnant within a year (See Table 1).
Thus, the discrepancy is sizable, and, despite previous analyses, its basis remains obscure. In this paper, advantage is taken of the longitudinal character of the Family Growth in Metropolitan America Study--hereafter abbreviated as the FGIMA Study--to explore the subject further.
HYPOTHESES
Among FGIMA couples, the conceptive delays reported by successful contraceptors as preceding first and second pregnancy average 5 months less than those calculated as preceding the first pregnancy in the reported absence of contraception. In a previous analysis (Westoff et al., 1961a) confined to data collected from the first of two interviews, it was concluded that sample selectivities as well as measurement errors contribute to this large discrepancy. For example, it was found that the elimination of premarital conceptions, though necessary on other grounds, tends to select against short delays of first pregnancy before contraception. Although the size of this effect can not be rigorously quantified, it is unlikely that it accounts for more than a small part of the 5-month discrepancy.
Then, too, voluntary factors appear to play a secondary role. Relatively few couples acknowledge trying to speed conception by augmenting coital frequency at special times of the month, and most such efforts occur only when the couple

find themselves slow to conceive (Potter et al., 1962). Thus, the notion may be doubted that successful contraceptors conceive more quickly because they make special efforts to hurry conception, while couples not yet practicing contraception let nature take its slow course.
Two hypotheses are tested in this paper. First, some of the respondents who reported no precautions taken before first pregnancy may actually have practiced contraception but in the interview forgot this fact or chose to conceal it. This type of error could have a large effect. For example, if the frequency of undisclosed contraception were as high as 15%, this would probably suffice to inflate the calculated mean delay by 3 months or so and to reduce the proportion conceiving within a year from 90 to 80%. Moreover, such a high frequency of undisclosed contraception is not altogether implausible in view of the fact that so many respondents gave inconsistent replies when asked duplicate questions about use and nonuse of contraception in two interviews administered 3 years apart (Westoff et al., 1961b). Lev-

els of consistency were especially low among users of rhythm, withdrawal, and douching, possibly because some of these women were uncertain whether to view their techniques as bona fide contraception.
The second hypothesis was originally proposed by Tietze (1956). A wife who wants another pregnancy eventually but who conceives while practicing negligent contraception might be tempted to rationalize the pregnancy as planned. Any such tendency would increase the frequency of very short delays reported by supposedly successful contraceptors.
DATA
At first interview, the FGIMA sample consisted of 1,165 urban, native-white, once-married American women who recently had a second live birth and who had experienced not more than one miscarriage. These restrictions with respect to pregnancy wastage and number of live births mean that the FGIMA couples are somewhat more fecund than average. Three years later, " 905 wives from the original panel were reinterviewed. Thirty of the 260 nonrespondents were

deemed ineligible for reinterview, but most of the attrition was due to inability to locate respondents who had moved. As a group, the 260 nonrespondents include a disproportionate number of Catholics and members of the working class.
During their first interview, respondents were asked whether they practiced contraception before each pregnancy. When they answered "no", their conceptive delays were estimated by calculating intervals between marriage (or previous delivery) and next delivery and then subtracting an allowance for gestation time. When they reported contraception, they were asked whether the pregnancy occurred after deliberately stopping contraception (a planned pregnancy) or while practicing contraception or omitting it to take a chance (an accidental pregnancy). Those who reported a planned pregnancy were finally asked to recall the number of months they waited for conception after terminating contraceptive measures.
All questions, except the last, were repeated in the second interview. Thus, it is possible to distinguish respondents who answered consistently in the two interviews from those who gave inconsistent replies.
Of special interest are the respondents who first reported no contraception before first pregnancy but then in the second interview reversed themselves. To the extent that this group includes a disproportionate number of respondents who failed to disclose use of contraception before first pregnancy, their delays of first conception will be longer than average. Another interesting group are those who report a pregnancy as planned in the first interview but then report the same pregnancy as accidental in the next

interview. On the assumption that this group includes a proportionately greater number of rationalizers of contraceptive failure, their reported conceptive delay will prove shorter than average.
The above two hypotheses may be defined operationally in another way. Respondents who consistently report a pregnancy as planned in both interviews will report delays averaging longer than 5 months because proportionately fewer persons rationalizing contraceptive failure are included among them. Respondents who consistently report not practicing contraception before first pregnancy will exhibit delays averaging less than 10 months because they include proportionately fewer respondents failing to disclose contraception. As a consequence, the difference in average conceptive delay between the two groups of consistent reporters should be less than 5 months.
RESULTS
Results, including the outcomes of significance tests, are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. All conceptive delays associated with separations or premarital conceptions have been removed. Most of the observed differences are as hypothesized and of a size to be practically significant. However, the numbers of respondents are not large enough to invest these differences with a high level of statistical significance.
The 5-month discrepancy is nearly halved when the two groups of respondents giving consistent reports are compared. Nearly all of this reduction appears to depend on the removal of respondents failing to report use of contraception before first pregnancy. To be sure, there is also a tendency for respondents reporting a pregnancy initially as planned and later as accidental to claim shorter-than-average delays. How-

56 Potter et al.

ever, not many respondents belong to this category, and the differential in conceptive delay between them and respondents more consistent about reporting a planned pregnancy is small. As a result, contrary to hypothesis, the wives reporting a planned pregnancy in both interviews do not show an average conceptive delay longer than 5 months.
On the other hand, those who consistently report no contraception before first pregnancy average 8 months as compared to 11 months for those who first

report no contraception but then later recall its use. Of course, some respondents may have neglected to mention contraception both times, so that even 8 months may overestimate the conceptive delays of this sample.
Taking the twice-interviewed women as a whole, there are 325 of them who report not practicing contraception before first pregnancy. The conceptive delays calculated for this group average 9 months as compared to 12 months for the corresponding group of 153 women

interviewed only once. This differential of 3 months does not necessarily mean that the 260 nonrespondents include a disproportionate number of uncooperative wives who chose to conceal their use of contraception. On the basis of several indirect checks, it was concluded (Freedman et al., 1959) that in a national sample such dissimulations were rare. A more likely explanation is that the 260 nonrespondents were over-represented with Catholics and members of the bluecollar class; these groups place greater emphasis upon rhythm, withdrawal, and douching as methods of contraception than do other groups; and, as already noted, users of these methods have particular problems remembering in which intervals they did or did not practice contraception.
DISCUSSION
Because the above results fail to attain high levels of statistical significance, they must be accepted with caution. Taken at face value, they imply that the conceptive delays calculated for respondents reporting no contraception before first pregnancy are more subject to error than are those reported by successful contraceptors, at least in the present sample. The principal source of distortion, namely, failure to disclose practice of contraception, doubtless applies to some of the other samples cited in Table 1, though the degrees of relevance remain conjectural.
Discussion of the proportion becoming pregnant in the first month has been deliberately avoided, since special problems are involved here. With reference to the Indianapolis and FGIMA Studies, it has been argued elsewhere (Westoff et al., 1961a) that both types of data on conceptive delays tend to exaggerate the proportions conceiving in the first month.

Actual proportions may be nearer .2 than .3 and certainly lie well below .4. Further corroboration comes from an analysis (Vincent, 1961) relating to several thousand French mothers having nine or more live births. Vincent estimates the probability of conception per menstrual cycle among newlyweds conceiving postnuptially to be 25.2±0.4 per cent. He reasons that this proportion might be raised to .27 or .28 if wives marrying at ages less than 20 were excluded.
If all these newlyweds had the same fecundability and if this shared monthly chance of conception remained constant, then one would expect the average interval between marriage and first birth to be approximately 1/.27 to 1/.28, 3.6 to 3.7 months. What Vincent finds is an average interval of 5 months, indicating at least some variation in fecundability. Of course, Vincent's population is selectedly fecund, so that 5 months must be regarded as a lower bound. Nevertheless, Vincent argues persuasively that the selection on fecundability is not as intense as one might first think. Given that weaning is early enough so that the average period of postpartum amenorrhea is fairly short (estimated as 7 months in his population), then most couples will be able to have large families, provided that they marry young and keep their first marriage intact and provided that they take no deliberate steps to limit family size. It is to be kept in mind that several groups are known (Henry, 1961) to average 8 or 9 children even when cases of primary and secondary sterility are included in the average. Thus, the selection on fecundability may not be much greater in Vincent's population than in the FGIMA sample. If this interpretation is accepted, Vincent's data represent additional evidence that mean
