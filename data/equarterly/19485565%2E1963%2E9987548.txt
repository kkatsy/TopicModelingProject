POPULATION DIFFERENCES IN RED AND GREEN COLOR VISION DEFICIENCY: A REVIEW, AND A QUERY ON SELECTION RELAXATION

I read with great interest the paper with the above title by Dr. Richard H. Post published in the September 1962 issue of Eugenics Quarterly (Vol. 9, no. 3, pp. 131-146). The idea that population differences in color blindness may be due to selection is not new. Garth (1933) already mentioned this as a possibility, and I also discussed this hypothesis in a monograph published in 1961. We owe to Dr. Post, however, recognition for the great task of bringing together all frequency estimates available in the literature and for the tentative explanation of them in terms of selective mechanisms. Although I think that Dr. Post's thesis in a general way may be correct (as shown by the paper I published in 1961), I want to point out some mistakes in his tabulation of data concerning the American Indians and to make other remarks about the frequencies of color blindness observed in these populations.
In Table 1 of his paper Dr. Post lists the following American Indian populations as hunters and food gatherers: Navajo (showing data from Garth, 1933), Ramah Navajo (Spuhler, 1951), several North American Indian tribes (Clements, 1930), Indian fullbloods plus Sioux (Garth, 1933), Brazilian Indians (Mattos, 1958), Caingang (Salzano, 1961b and Fernandes et al., 1957), and Carajas (Junqueira et al., 1957). There are some minor errors in the tabulation: for instance, the Indians tested by me are indicated as living in the State of Paraná,

while they actually live in Rio Grande do Sul, and the frequency giving for the Caingang Indians tested by Fernandes et al. (1957) is the uncorrected one, not the one given by the authors after taking into account the fact that many individuals in the sample were biologically related. But, of course, this is not important. The point stressed by Dr. Post is that all these populations have lower frequencies of colorblind persons compared with populations of pastoral-agricultural economics.
Let us see what the evidences are for grouping all these groups under the heading of hunters and gatherers. No doubt, the Navajo have had a subsistence economy based mainly on hunting, but they had agriculture as well. Concerning the Ramah Navajo tested by Spuhler (1951), Spuhler and Kluckhohn (1953) state that their "subsistence pattern is a combination of sheep husbandry and dry-farming agriculture" (page 299). Clements (1930) does not indicate which tribes he had tested, mentioning only that they were Indians from California and the Southwest. The latter may have subsisted primarily on hunting, but the California Indians were mostly gatherers; hunting and fishing were not very important for their subsistence. Concerning the groups tested by Garth (1933), again no tribal subdivisions are given; he states, however, that most of the Indians tested were Pueblos, Navajos, and Sioux. As is well known, the

Pueblos practiced agriculture extensive-
Therefore, as indicated, several groups of North American Indians were wrongly placed in the hunter-and-gathering category. The situation concerning the South American Indians is in no way better. The Caingang have had more than 100 years of contact with the neoBrazilian way of life and subsist presently mainly by means of agriculture. The Carajas are primarily fishermen, with some agriculture; therefore, we are left just with the Indians studied by Mattos (1958). A list of the tribes investigated by him is presented in the accompanying table. As shown there, of the 359 individuals studied only 81 could be placed in the hunter-and-gathering category.
The evidence presented for a low fre-

quency of color blindness among hunters and gatherers is thus much weakened by the different subsistence categories to which the majority of the groups just discussed belong. The small number of populations studied which still have a hunter-and-gathering type of economy is not surprising due to the low number of individuals available for study and the difficulty in locating such groups. As a matter of fact, an international group met in Geneva from November 27 to December 3, 1962, under the auspices of the World Health Organization, just to establish plans for a coordinated study of such populations all over the world. The urgency of such investigations was stressed there, since groups with this type of economy are rapidly disappearing.

·Although Mattos mentions in the summary of his work that he studied 230 males and 129 females, he actually gives information in the lists presented about 231 males and 128 females.

Let me finish with a word of caution against easy generalizations. Although Dr. Post emphasized the tentative nature of his conclusions, there exists the danger that people will start to quote the paper without the necessary reservations. Just to illustrate the need for more data, I may mention that Mattos (1958) found no color blindness among the Caingangs of the State of Sao Paulo; Fernandes et al. (1957) found 6.4% of defectives among the Caingangs of Paraná; and I found 4.3% in the Caingangs of Rio Grande do Sul. Nevertheless, all these populations can be placed in the same level of cultural development. And which of these figures should be taken as representative of the Caingang? If the Mestizos studied by me (Salzano, 1961b) are included in the analysis of the data, striking differences are to be found between Caingang localities in Rio Grande do Sul. In one, I found 9.7% of defectives; in another, all individuals tested were normal. Reasons are given in Salzano (1961b) to regard this as a possible instance of the action of genetic drift. Mattos (1958) found no colorblind individuals among Guaranis from the State of Sao Paulo; I studied recently a large Guarani family living in the State of Santa Catarina with several colorblind

persons, including two women. More
data are certainly needed concerning this
trait in primitive groups, and I hope Dr.
Post's review will serve to direct atten-
tion to this need.
