INTRODUCTION
For almost fifteen years, studies of consanguineous marriages and of consanguinity in general have increased. Freire-Maia (1957) and then Serra and Soini (1959) have compiled an exhaustive bibliography on the subject. The progress made possible in the human sciences by advances in quantitative techniques has been responsible for the heightened interest in the subject of consanguinity. Actually consanguinity data have pertinence for many of the biological sciences. In demography, in order to study marriage patterns, it is certainly important to determine the number of consanguineous marriages in a population. Structural anthropology, as demonstrated so ably by Lévi-Strauss, is concerned with the influence of cumulative heredity (consanguinity) upon human society. These studies are of the utmost importance because they have served as patterns for the introduction of quantitative theories in a field where precision and foresight were unknown. If ethnology and structural anthropology can be enriched by consanguinity data, then contemporary sociology and other investigations of occidental populations also may benefit from a study of the decline in the frequency of consanguineous marriages.

Physical anthropology also can be strengthened by the acquisition of facts brought to light by consanguinity studies. By formulating the concept of isolation, population genetics has clearly presented the possibilities for the evolution of human societies toward the normal or the pathologic. If physical anthropology is to emerge from its present crisis, it can be only through the application of Mendelian genetics to human populations. It has been established that the questions raised by morphological differences among bones (although studied through the ages and classically associated with paleontology) can only be interpreted or even solved in this sense. Ferembach (1961) has stated clearly what the impact of the isolation theory may be upon paleontologists and upon others who study primitive populations on the historical level. Anthropology devotes more and more time to these problems; and it seems that the fate of this science rests, on the one hand, on the evolution of biométrie techniques and, on the other hand, on the constant progress realized by quantitative genetics and population genetics.
The findings of consanguinity studies also bear upon sanitary and medical projects. When, in our time, in response to a variety of pressures both internal and external, the isolates dispersed, they founded a number of partial populations in larger units. This phenomenon has been reflected favorably in the im-

proved physical well-being of our occidental populations. The day will come when we will be able to measure these transformations and appreciate the conditions that gave rise to them. The prevailing exogamy has contributed greatly to a reduction in the frequency of tuberculosis and a number of recessive illnesses, such as illnesses of the nervous system. The heterosis phenomenon, virtually triggered by the new modality of the couple's choice, has also contributed to a change in the physiognomy of populations, as shown, for example, by the increased height that seems to be the rule in occidental populations.
This research has been fruitful in still another area: migrations. Whether migrations are studied by geographers, demographers, or sociologists, it is necessary to find some means to determine and compare genotypes (in order to evaluate the effect of distance). Measurements of the effects of human displacements, essential for the geneticist's studies, are equally as interesting to those studying migrations in an historical or contemporary context. The researches of the Swedish Geography School on this subject parallel those of the biologists, as we have stated elsewhere (Sutter, 1960).
From this rapid survey we may conclude that population genetics--and more precisely consanguinity studies-- deal with human phenomena from which no student of the human sciences may remain aloof. All these studies reveal how necessary it is to establish a close collaboration between these various fields. It is obvious, for instance, that sociology alone could solve the problem of the split of isolates, since it is demonstrated that it is in the psychology of individuals of marriageable age that lies the explanation of the social

phenomenon studied here. The marriageable individuals are those who, by their behavior, are responsible for the new situation; it is at this point of the social evolution that we should try to explain the phenomenon described here.
PRESENT RESEARCH
Method Used
The method used here to estimate the consanguineous marriages of all the French departments between 1946 and 1958 is the one used in a previous study covering 1926-1945. (Sutter and Tabah, 1948). We used the dispensations required by the Roman Catholic Church to solemnize marriages between the following degrees of relationships: the third degree, which we shall indicate as 3D (uncle-niece, aunt-nephew); the fourth degree, 4D (first cousins); the fifth degree, 5D (first cousins once removed); the sixth degree, 6D (second cousins); and, finally cases where we deal with double cousins. The first work on consanguinity --by Orel, 1932--used a similar method in the diocese of Vienna, Austria.
In practice, the Church gives all dispensations requested except for the third degree, which since 1935 has been given only in exceptional cases. Actually, the number of such marriages has always been extremely small (see Sutter and Levy, 1959). On the other hand, the French archdioceses and dioceses--some 87 of them--comply with the laws of their corresponding civil districts. In some rare cases, where the religious and departmental jurisdictions do not agree completely, the township or the district prevails. For instance, the district of Vouziers in the Ardennes belongs to the Reims episcopate (Marne); the city of Villeurbanne (Rhône), to the Grenoble diocese (Isère). There is always the

possibility that the population may revert to endogamy, depending upon the degree of ecclesiastic or civil control.
The annual figures for consanguineous marriages, degree by degree, were supplied to us by the religious administrations. The percentage of marriages that are consanguineous in the degrees specified was derived from the number of religious marriages annually. Here there is a problem we pointed out in 1948, at the time of our first publication: some dioceses, although they keep the parish registry records, do not convert them into annual statistics. A thorough study has shown that the percentage of religious marriages by department is, like all demographic phenomenon, rather rigid, remaining very steady through the course of time. Strictly civil marriages, marriages among persons of other faiths, and also remarriages of divorcees maintain the same frequency.
Yearly variations in Catholic marriages seldom exceed 5%. It is, therefore, sufficient to gather, for instance, records of two or three years of religious marriages and compare them with the number of civil marriages to obtain the proportion of religious marriages in the area.
The statistics on consanguineous marriages presented in Table 1, for 1946-- 1958, cover about 3,450,000 Catholic marriages. In each department, for the periods 1946-1950, 1951-1955, and 19561958, we have reported the number of marriages involving each of the degrees of relationship specified above and the percentages of such marriages with reference to the total number of Catholic marriages solemnized in the area.
Table 1 shows the extent to which the disappearance of consanguineous marriages has become a generalized fact. This holds true not only for each degree

of consanguinity but also for its percentage of the total number of marriages. In any case, this percentage has decreased in all but seven departments where it has been stationary: AlpesMaritimes, 0.66; Charente, 0.68; Eureet-Loir, 0.54; Haute-Marne, 0.59; DeuxSèvres and Vienne, 0.50; Tarn-et-Garonne, 0.68. This may be explained, however, by pointing out that the percentages for these departments are extremely low; in other words, they have reached a new (lower) equilibrium.
The dispersion of the isolates, upon which (on the matrimonial level) partial populations are founded in larger unities has consequently continued actively in recent years.
We restrict our observations on this point, reserving our right to study later, precisely, degree by degree, this decrease in the frequency of consanguineous marriages. One day it will be necessary to study the social aspects of this very definite phenomenon: the disappearance of endogamy. For the time being, it is simpler to view this evolution on the biological level alone, since any metrical appraisal must of necessity involve genetics and accordingly provide exact information on individual biological structures.

of Consanguinity

·'

For each department the average coefficient of consanguinity expresses clearly, by itself, the probable incidence of homozygosis. This coefficient, called a de Bernstein or F de Wright, represents the probability that two similar loci, in a person picked at random from the population under study, are identical. It enables us to evaluate, a priori, this probability for any individual in the population. Using our previous and

the rural departments having no important city areas.
From 1926 to 1930 the following departments had the highest values:
In the Alps: Hautes-Alpes, BassesAlpes, Haute-Savoie, Savoie.
In the Pyrénées: Ariège, Hautes-Pyrénées, Basses-Pyrénées.
In the Massif central: Ardèche, Lozère, Aveyron, Haute-Loire, Cantal, Corrèze, Puy-de-Dome.
In the Massif armoricain and the bordering departments: Morbihan, Côtesdu-Nord, Finistère, then Loire-Atlantique, Vendée, Maine-et-Loire, Mayenne, et Manche.
In the East: Meuse, Moselle, HautRhin, and Bas-Rhin were the centers o£ endogamy, though to a lesser degree.
From 1936 to 1940 (Fig. 2), as frequently pointed out, dispersion of the isolates quickened, and we witnessed the disappearance of endogamy. The agricultural districts from the Massif armoricain to the East border, on the one hand, from the north to the Pyrenees and from Burgundy to the Mediterranean shores, on the other hand, were affected most by the phenomenon and became homogeneous little by little. The Alps and the Pyrénées, the Massif central, the Massif armoricain, and the East were also affected but, nonetheless, managed to retain their previous aspect.
Finally, in the latest period (19561958) endogamy has almost completely disappeared. (Fig. 3). Only seven departments are left to weigh with the scale used in 1926-1930: Corsica, BassesAlpes, the three departments of the Massif central, where a strong endogamous tradition remains--the Aveyron, the Cantal, and Lozère--and, in the West, the Morbihan and the Mayenne.
We must emphasize that if, instead o£ giving our results department by de-

partment, we were to give them community by community, we would see at once that the incidence of consanguinity rests solely upon a few communities that have kept their endogamic character intact. The dispersion of the isolates is a phenomenon that depends on the "all or nothing" principle, as shown previously in the results cited for two departments (Sutter and Tabah, 1955). Be that as it may, this tendency toward homogeneity in the population becomes evident when we compare the distribution of consanguinity coefficients within the various departments over a period of time: the average and the variance of this distribution have decreased simultaneously. (See Table 3.)
From 1926-1930 to 1956-1958, the true average has gone from 85.6 to 22.4 and the variance from 2,216 to 164. Note the peculiarity of the World War II period (1941-1945): although the average is lower than during the previous period, the variance is higher, 1,191 against 991. This can be explained by a fact pointed out previously: a return to endogamy caused by the war. This revival of consanguineous marriage that

values for average coefficients ofconsanguinity and perinatal mortality, there is a coefficient of correlation of 0.74 -± 0.08 (Sutter and Tabah, 1948, 1951); and with the number of deaf-mutes counted at home by the 1946 census, there is a coefficient of 0.57 (Sutter and Tabah, 1952). From the same data Lamy and Frésal (1958) have found a correlation equal to 0.57 with twin births as a whole; in fact, it exists only in thecase of dizygotic twins. Aubenque (personal communication) has found some interesting correlations with certain causesof death, such as congenital cardiacmalformations.
Indeed, wecannot accept these results without further investigation; so many factors are involved in the preceding phenomena that new inquiries are necessary to affirm the genetic aspects. In our case, we propose to analyze the study of relationships between thevarious factors, among them genetic aspects and perinatal mortality. Lamy and Frésal (1958) have shown the existence of a high correlation between consanguinity and themother's age at thetime of twin births. The two factors may operate simultaneously.
Be that as it may, in many countries research is under way to confirm the role

of genetic structures on demographic
phenomena, especially mortality: Serra
and Soini (Italy), Freire-Maia (Brazil),
Goldschmidt and collaborators (Israel),
Neel (United States and Japan). Neel is
preparing an exhaustive study of the
question.
