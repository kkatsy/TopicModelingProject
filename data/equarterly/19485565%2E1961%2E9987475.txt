1 HE ATTITUDE of the Japanese Government toward sterilization differs from that toward induced abortion. Control is likely to be stricter over the former than the latter, except in cases where sterilization is performed for "eugenic" reasons.
Under the Eugenic Protection Law, passed in 1948 for eugenic reasons and to protect the life and health of the mother, both sterilization and induced abortion are permitted in cases where either the mother or father has a hereditary disease, psychosis or leprosy. Relatives within the fourth degree of consanguinity suffering from the former two also constitute legal grounds for either abortion or sterilization. In addition, both are permitted when pregnancy threatens the life of the mother. These provisions involve rather clear-cut medical grounds about which there is little ambiguity.
Induced abortion is further permitted in the case of "a mother whose health may be affected seriously . . . by delivery from the physical or economic viewpoint."1 For sterilization, the law does not explicitly prescribe an "economic" basis, but latitude and ambiguity in the

exercise of this and possible other motives are latent in Article 3, paragraph 5, which permits sterilization "when the mother already has several children and every pregnancy and delivery can lower her health." First of all, the term "several" is ambiguous. How many is several --two, three, or more? Also, the word "lower" is a vague expression, involving a subjective judgment of grade of health. It is quite natural, thus, that much misunderstanding and varying standards should have arisen under Article 3, paragraph 5.
The figures on sterilization prepared by the Government from reports of designated doctors2 (Table 1) indicate a rapid increase in sterilization cases during the past decade. Table 1 shows that the number of sterilization cases rose from less than 6,000 in 1949 to over 44,000 in 1956, an almost eight-fold increase in seven years. The number of cases has decreased slightly since that time.
The finding that next draws our attention is that relatively few cases are performed for eugenic reasons, usually accounting for less than 5 per cent of the total. Another striking fact is the rapid increase from 5.8 thousand in 1951 to 21.2 thousand in 1952 to 31.2 thousand in 1953in the number of cases relating to

paragraph 4, Article 3, that is, cases in which pregnancy threatens mother's life. Since obviously diseases serious enough to threaten life could not possibly increase so rapidly within a year or two, the major part of the added cases should properly be ascribed to paragraph 5 rather than to paragraph 4 of Article 3 of the Law. Apparently in 1952 and 1953 paragraph 5 was not invoked at all by the designated doctors, a situation they corrected in 1954 when adverse effect on health was cited almost twice as often as threat to life.
The conclusion is therefore warranted that the rapid increase in sterilization cases in the past decade was mainly based on health considerations, which in essence is birth control. In other words, the rapid growth of sterilization in recent years is a manifestation of the intense desire of the general public to control family size, as was observed in the case of induced abortion.
What, then, is the difference in motivation for induced abortion and for sterilization? This question will be treated in the forthcoming section after this part is ended with a breakdown of the sterilization cases by sex, shown in Table 2. Although male sterilizations account for less than 5 per cent of the total every

year, the proportion increased from 1.4 per cent in 1949 to 4.2 per cent in 1957. By 1959 this proportion was down to 3.0. It is interesting that these differences coincide with the trend of sterilization cases as a whole, suggesting that sterilization is apt to increase only by a more active participation of men.
The findings presented thus far were based on figures from reports of the designated doctors who sterilized a total of some 350,000 persons between 1949 and 1959. This number does not represent the total for Japan, for many were sterilized on black markets, for a total estimated at three to four times the operations performed by designated doctors. Whatever the true figure, sterilizations are exerting considerable influence upon

the reproductivity of the Japanese population and it is quite natural that the Government should attach importance to this practice. Before taking any countermeasures, however, it is essential that the Government ascertain the reasons and circumstances that impel people to undergo sterilization.
In consideration of these needs, our staff initiated a study in January 1958 which thus far has collected information from 812 persons sterilized since the Eugenic Protection Law went into effect. Of these, 180, or 22 per cent, were husbands and 632 were wives. The number of respondents varied with the questions, however, since respondents frequently could not give unequivocal replies. The interviewers were for the most part medical doctors, plus some adequately trained midwives from our staff. The sources from which cases were drawn are shown in Table 3.
Our first consideration was to investigate the reasons for resorting to sterilization. The results obtained from 4773 respondents are shown in Table 4. The most conspicuous finding from Table 4 is that almost three times as many cases were motivated by the desire to control family size as by medical reasons. This proportion is much higher than the one found in the Government's data based on reports of designated doctors. Moreover, the likelihood must be considered that many cases would be impelled to seek some medical ground for the sterilization since on this basis they would pay a smaller health insurance fee, although their basic motivation would be family limitation.
We next checked the number of living children each couple had at the time of

sterilization. As indicated in Table 5 three-fourths of the mothers had three or more living children when sterilized and over a third (35%) had four or more living children. Only 3 per cent had but one child, and only one person was childless. Almost half the women (43%) were 30 to 34 years old and had two or more children.
It is worthwhile to compare these figures with those for induced abortion, obtained from 1,382 wives interviewed by us in 19524 (Table 6). Although the latter survey is somewhat outdated, it is still valid as far as number of children at time of abortion is concerned.
The data in Table 6 suggest that if people are not sterilized before they have more than three or four children, the

likelihood is that of the two methods, they will avoid future births by induced abortion rather than by sterilization. It will be noted that while different family size occurs with about the same frequency among the induced abortion group (except at the extremes), the sterilized group is concentrated at the three children level and 82 per cent of them had two to four children. This indicates clearly that some concept of optimum number of children operates more forcefully among couples undergoing sterilization than among those resorting to induced abortion.
A similar relation is observed regarding age (Table 7). A great concentration (43%) of the sterilized are in the 30-34 year age group, compared with 28% of the induced abortion group, who are found with almost equal frequency in the two adjacent age groups. That the 30-34 year age group is the modal group is not surprising since by this age the great majority have borne as many as three children and at the same time still face ten to fifteen years of reproductive capacity.
Another factor influencing sterilization is the sex of the children in a family. This is important in Japan where sons are deemed necessary.
By observing the figures in Table 8 diagonally, we get a frequency distribution of families by the sex composition

of their children. For example, 26 of the 812 families have one child, divided in their sex composition as follows:
fm 10 : 16
The 173 families having two children are classified in their sex composition as follows:
ff fm mm 34 : 95 : 44 The 325 families having three children are distributed as follows:
fff ffm fmm mmm 34 : 125 : 120 : 46 Observing these figures, one notes that the distribution favors the male component. In comparing the observed frequency with a theoretically expected frequency based on the present sex ratio by age of the Japanese population as a whole, we conclude that families with male children resort to sterilization more readily than do those having only female children.
Besides the above, many other factors influence the decision to undergo the operation: physical, psychological, marital, and others. Particularly important is the consciousness that permanent infertility will not disturb the existing good relation between husband and wife.
Another factor that helps a person decide to resort to sterilization is an awareness that physical well-being is never weakened or threatened by such an operation. Incidentally, some of the women in our study feared a masculinization of their bodies and some men feared feminization, a fear that can be overcome when patients realize that this operation has nothing to do with hormone secretion. However, insofar as sexual interest is concerned, we felt a need to conduct a careful investigation, inquiring also whether or not the patients were satisfied with the operation. In

view of the complexities of psychological and biological approaches, we proceeded as carefully as possible, omitting a fairly large number of cases who gave ambiguous or vague answers.
As observed in Table 9, about twothirds of the women and almost all of the men indicated no change in sexual feeling. Interestingly, more than onefourth of the women answered that an excitement took place at sexual intercourse--probably resulting from the realization that, having been sterilized, they would never become pregnant. As for the psychological effects, an impressive finding was that 10 per cent of the wives expressed regret. Our interviewer asked why. Most of them did not answer, but some said that they wanted another child and others replied that their husbands began to hold them in contempt, as if they were no longer women.
We come now to a most important consideration--who takes the initiative for the sterilization operation (Table 10). In nearly 30 per cent of the cases of female sterilization, the wife took the initiative and the husband agreed to the operation. In 22 per cent of the cases, the operation was performed with consent of

both husband and wife. Incidentally, among the latter group some said that it was difficult to answer who of the two suggested the idea first. Thus, in a little over half the cases, the initiative was taken by the wife, abetted by the consent or concomitant initiative of the husband. In an additional 15 per cent the wife was the initiator but she had to prevail upon her husband to agree.- Husbands took the initiative for the wife's sterilization in 27.5% of the cases, twothirds of the time with the wife's ready agreement.
With regard to male sterilization, the situation is somewhat different. In 86.3 per cent (2, 3 and 5 in Table 10), the initiative was taken by husbands with their wives readily consenting threequarters of the time. This implies that husbands are more positive and progressive about this than wives. If the distribution in Table 10 is examined horizontally instead of vertically, it is found that disregarding whether the spouse agrees readily or reluctantly, male sterilization results in 5 per cent of the cases when the wife takes the initiative compared with 31 per cent of the cases when the husband is the initiator. When they propose the operation jointly, 13 per cent of the operations are on males, 87 per cent on females.
Since as noted earlier in this paper, sterilization is a means of practicing fam-

ily planning, we investigated the relationship between sterilization and other methods of conception control.
None of the 720 people for whom this information was available underwent sterilization without some previous experience in birth control. As noted in Table 11, the fact that 275 out of 720 persons, or 38 per cent, resorted to sterilization without ever having had an induced abortion also is worthy of note. It is presumed that these people, having practiced conception control successfully, decided to undergo sterilization to avoid the troublesome use of contraceptives. In contrast to these, 445 of 720, or about 60 per cent, had had experience with induced abortion before they decided to undergo sterilization. The average number of abortions per family experiencing abortion is 1.6. It is amazing that about 10 per cent of the sterilized persons had undergone induced abortion three or more times.

These findings show us that sterilization is often resorted to as an alternative to conception control, or as a remedy for induced abortion. This also suggests that if induced abortion is strongly suppressed or prohibited at a place where facilities for conception control are limited, people may be inclined to become sterilized.
Our sample area affords an example of this. At the Kanikita Steel Mining Company in Iwate Prefecture, located in a remote place, the workers live in a very limited area in the mountains. The incentive to control births there is extremely strong because of the poor facilities to bring up and educate children, so that the great majority of the families practice conception control. However, they often fail in the use of contraceptives, because they are poorly informed on the correct technique and contraceptive supplies are inadequate. When wives become pregnant accidentally, they are very anxious to go to town to have abortion induced, a very expensive undertaking. Hence, sterilization is resorted to as a necessity, preferably on the male because husbands can undergo surgery at a smaller cost.
SUMMARY
1. From fewer than 6,000 sterilizations in 1949, the number performed by designated doctors increased to over 44,000 in 1956, with a slight decline since then. By 1959 they had performed some 350,000 sterilizations. Estimates of the total in Japan, including black market operations, amount to three to four times this figure. It is clear that this practice is

exerting a considerable influence on the reproductivity of the Japanese population.
2. The reason for this development is not an increase in serious diseases that necessitate the operation, but rather the disposition of couples to resort to sterilization as a means of checking births.
3. Number of children is a most significant factor in the decision to undergo sterilization. Among the sterilized couples in our survey, the modal group had three children, comprising 40% of our families. The existence of a male child is important in the decision to resort to sterilization. Other motivating factors are economic, physical, marital, psychological, etc.
4. Female sterilizations account for more than 95 per cent of the total. The proportion of male sterilization cases, though small at any time, increases when the whole number of sterilization cases increases, suggesting that sterilization is apt to increase only by a more active participation of men.
5. The husband takes the initiative in cases of male sterilization and the wife in cases of female sterilization. However, in a fairly large number of female sterilizations, the husband took the initiative. Cases of male sterilization undergone by the desire of the wife are very rare.
6. Sterilization is being used as an alternative to conception control or induced abortion. This suggests that if induced abortion were powerfully suppressed in any way (or at a place where conception control was inconvenient), sterilization would become increasingly popular.
