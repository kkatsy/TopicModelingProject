THE CONCEPT OF ADAPTATION IN THE STUDY OF HUMAN POPULATIONS

If a biologist may be permitted a few brief comments concerning the usages of the term "adaptation" raised by the anthropologist P. E. Lestrel (1967) during his critique of P. H. Baker's paper (1966), it perhaps will be possible to clarify certain points that are extremely important for workers in human biology. The indiscriminate use of mathematical symbols to "define" the word "adaptation" adds nothing to explaining the complicated process of adaptation as seen in human populations nor does it make the definition "more scientifically adequate." Lestrel confuses the concept of defining a word with the methods used to recognize the entity that is being defined.
The concepts of adaptation and fitness certainly bear a relationship to one another, but it is by no means true, as was stated by Lestrel, that these terms are synonymous. Nor is it true, as was implied by Lestrel, that the early population geneticists Fisher (1930), Haldane (1932), and Wright (1949) considered these words to mean the same. This becomes quite obvious after a cursory reading of their papers cited above.
To almost all evolutionists the concept of adaptation has centered around the interaction between the organism and its environment (see, for example, Simpson, 1953; Mayr, 1963; Bock and von Wahlert, 1965; Williams, 1966). It is useful for human biologists to note the differences between "physiological adaptation" and "evolutionary adaptation." The former describes the responses of adult tissues to different environmental stimuli. The increase in

number of red blood cells in an oxygen-
deprived environment is a good example.
It is also important to realize that the
ability to modify the adult phenotype
with changes in environment is itself an
evolutionary adaptation. The process of
evolutionary adaptation can be thought
of as any evolutionary change that re-
duces the amount of energy necessary
to maintain the interaction between the
organism and its environment see Bock
and von Wahlert, 1965, for a detailed
discussion of these terms).
Most biologists, and I suspect most
anthropologists, will find it difficult to
apply Lestrel's concept of adaptation to
their researches. Baker's method of the
study of adaptation in human popula-
tions is more apt to yield the better
results.
