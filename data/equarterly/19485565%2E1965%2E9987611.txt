ENVIRONMENTAL VERSUS GENETIC INTERPRETATIONS OF BIRTH-ORDER EFFECTS

The effects of birth-order differences on the risks of pre-and post-natal morbidity and mortality, like those of parental age differences, may reflect to some degree the operation of genetic causes. This being the case, there is reason to consider in what ways such causes may be distinguished collectively from those that are environmental in origin, and to what extent present information may serve to place limits on the magnitude of the genetic component.
Interest in the special risks to the child associated with advancing parental age, as indicating possible elevated mutant frequencies in germ cells of aging parents, has been current for nearly ten years (Penrose, 1955; Sonneborn, 1956) and preceded the discovery that at least one genetic condition, mongolism, is in fact due to gross chromosomal mutations that are especially apt to occur in older mothers. Similarly, the special risks associated with advancing birth order might be regarded as possibly indicative of the operation of genetic causes of another kind, associated with maternalfetal incompatibilities and the increased likelihood with each successive pregnancy of maternal sensitization and antibody production. Genetic differences at the Rh locus are known to give rise to effects of this kind (although those at the ABO locus do not, because the associated antibodies are ready formed and do not require prior maternal sensitization in order to affect the fetus). Just how numer-

ous and important such systems are is still a matter of speculation, and to what extent they may contribute to the elevated risks associated with advancing birth orders is almost entirely unknown.
While perinatal mortality might perhaps be regarded as the most likely manifestation of the actions of antibodies from sensitized mothers that cross the placenta and interfere with the normal development of the embryo, there is at least some evidence that congenital anomalies of living children may also arise as a consequence. For example, mothers of children with familial athyrotic cretinism have in certain instances been found to have in their circulation high titres of antibodies against thyroid tissue (Sutherland, et al., 1960), and experiments with laboratory vertebrates tend to confirm the implication that exposure of the embryo to antibodies against particular tissues and tissue components (such as those against proteins from the lens of the eye) can induce developmental anomalies in the expected organs or regions of the embryo (Langman, 1964). In this connection, it is of interest that substantial elevations of the risks of strabismus, and of certain other congenital malformations of the nervous system and sense organs, have been shown among children of advanced birth order, independent of the age of the mother (Néwcombe and Tavendale, 1964). Thought should therefore be given to assessing the possible magnitude

of the genetic component in birth order effects associated, not only with fetal and child mortality, but with congenital anomalies of living children as well.
Examination of the kindred problem of identifying a genetic component in a number of parental age effects has shown that environmental factors may mimic the anticipated genetic effects in a number of ways, and that a final separation of the two sorts of contribution may depend upon the availability of much greater amounts of empirical data than are currently at hand. The same may well prove true of the genetic contributions to birth-order effects. Nevertheless, the problem is worth pursuing as far as the available sources of data permit.
In the present study use is made of information contained in routine records of live births, stillbirths, child deaths, and handicaps of children.
MANNER OF OBTAINING THE DATA
Information concerning the birth order of a child and the ages of its parents is normally recorded together only at the time of the birth, on the birth registration form. If a child is stillborn, this fact is recorded with the other information on a single document. However, if the child is born alive and later dies or is noted to be affected with some handicapping anomaly, this separately recorded information can usually only be related to the birth order and parental ages by matching, or "linking," the two independently derived records concerning the one individual. In practice such record linkages involve comparisons of names and other identifying information, such as birth dates and birth places, to ensure that the paired documents in fact relate to the same persons.
Linkages of infant death records with the birth records of the dead children are

now carried out routinely, by hand, in a number of registration areas. Such clerical matching operations tend to be laborious and costly, however, and for this reason are not generally applied to deaths beyond the first year of life.
Recently, computer methods have been developed by which linkages of records from large files can be carried out rapidly and accurately, despite the common imperfections and unreliability of the individual items of identifying information (Newcombe, et al., I959; Kennedy, 1961; Newcombe and Kennedy, 1962). These methods have now been employed to link to the birth registrations, records of child deaths beyond the first year of life and records of handicapping conditions among living children.
THE SOURCE RECORDS
Use is made in the present study of stillbirths, infant and child deaths, and registerable handicaps for the Canadian province of British Columbia, linked as necessary either with the birth registrations, or with the physician's notices of birth, which for this province are separate documents although they are assigned the same series of birth registration numbers. The details of: the record files and of the linkages carried out are given below:
Infant Mortality
Published statistics of deaths under one year of age among children born in the calendar years 1952-60 include tabulations from the routine manual linkages with physicians' notices of births, in which the parental ages and pregnancy orders are stated. In this connection, pregnancy order differs from birth order in that it includes pregnancies terminât-

ing in early fetal deaths, whereas birth order takes cognizance only of those giving rise to stillbirths (i.e., fetal deaths following gestations of 28 weeks or more) and to live births. Breakdowns of the numbers of infant deaths and of live births, simultaneously by pregnancy order and maternal age group are given in special reports on infant mortality in British Columbia (Division of Vital Statistics Special Reports Nos. 42 and 64).
Stillbirths
Tabulations were carried out directly, without record linkage, from punchcard records of 2,403 stillbirths in the years 1953-58. Of these, 5 failed to state mother's age or birth order, or both, so that the tabulations by these two variables relate to 2,398 records.
Child Handicaps
Records of handicapping conditions of children born alive in 1953-58 and registered as handicapped over the years 1953-61 were linked by computer with the birth registrations of the same children to produce a single summary record containing birth order and maternal age. A total of 4,716 such summary records were produced. (Of 5,478 handicap records, 762 failed to link to any British Columbia birth record, and there is reason to believe that nearly all of the children concerned were born outside the province.) Of the 4,716 linkage summary cards, 5 failed to state maternal age or birth order, or both, leaving 4,711 for tabulation.
Child Deaths
Records of deaths of children born alive in 1953-58 and dying before the end of 1958 were similarly linked by computer with the appropriate birth

registrations to produce death-birth summary records containing birth orders and maternal age. A total of 6,437 such linkage summary records were produced. (Because the province of birth is stated on death registrations, it was possible to select for linkage only the deaths of children who were said to have been born in British Columbia; 19 death records relating to such children failed to link to an appropriate birth record.) Of the 6,437 death-birth summary records, 33 failed to state maternal age or birth order, or both, leaving 6,404 for tabulation.
Live Birth Controls1953-58
Published statistics on live births in British Columbia over the years 1953-58 contain tabulations of the numbers of births distributed simultaneously by maternal age and birth order (Vital Statistics of the Province of British Columbia, Eighty-Second Report to Eighty-Seventh Report). These data served as controls in studies of stillbirths, child handicaps, and child deaths among individuals born over the 1953-58 period.
COMPUTER METHODS
The nature of the methods by which successive routine records relating to the same individual or family may be linked by computer to yield case and family histories of reproductive and health events has been described in detail elsewhere (Kennedy, 1961; Newcombe, et al., 1959; Newcombe and Kennedy, 1962). Recent improvements in the basic programs and use of a more modern computer (Control Data G20) have resulted in rates of file updating and linkage into individual and family histories in the vicinity of 2,000 incoming records per minute.

Tabulations from the files of stillbirth records, and of linkage summary records for handicaps and deaths, were carried out on the G20 computer using a generalized tabulation program known as FREAK, written by AECL's Computing Section. Another computer program, likewise provided by the Computing Section and known as NEWSTAT, was employed to derive relative risks for the different pregnancy and birth orders, independent of maternal age effects, together with the associated confidence limits, using the mathematical procedure of Woolf (1955).

INFANT DEATHS
The numbers of infant deaths among children born in British Columbia during 1952-60, together with the numbers of live births and the infant death rates per 1,000 liveborn children, are given in Table 1, broken down simultaneously by pregnancy order and mother's age group.
Differences in infant death rates associated with different pregnancy orders may conveniently be expressed as relative incidence figures for the successive pregnancy orders. These are provided by the expression x=aB/Ab where x is the rela-

tive incidence for a given pregnancy order, a and A are the numbers of "affected" and "control" children of that pregnancy order, and b and B the corresponding numbers for all other pregnancy orders combined. Confidence limits, at the 95 per cent level, are represented by the antilogarithms to the base e of (y ± 1.96 standard deviations), where y is the natural logarithm of x, and its standard deviation is \/^fw= \/^JTJ{\Jä + l/A + l/b + lB) (Woolf 1955).
Application of the methods to data from Table 1, broken down by pregnancy order alone, is illustrated in Table 2. The results indicate an increasing risk of infant death with advancing pregnancy order. However, since maternal age is closely correlated with pregnancy order and may itself be contributing to the elevated risk, there is no certainty from the above comparisons that the effect is due primarily to differences in pregnancy order.
To permit study of pregnancy-order effects from which contributions due to maternal age differences have been removed, the same kind of calculation may be carried out separately for each mater-

nal age group, using data broken down simultaneously by pregnancy order and mother's age. The individual relative incidence figures for a given pregnancy order may then be combined into a single weighted mean relative incidence, X, which equals the antilogarithm to the base e of Y where y^z^wy/^w; 95 per cent confidence limits for X are given by the antilogarithms to the base e of (Y± 1.96 standard deviations), where the standard deviation of Y is l/VXw (Woolf 1955). Application of the method to data from Table 1 is illustrated in Table 3.
The results indicate that the increasing risk of infant death with advancing pregnancy order persists even when contributions from maternal age effects are removed. There is, in fact, a consistent increase in risk for infants of successively higher pregnancy orders, which is the more striking when contributions from maternal age effects are removed (Fig. 1). Conversely, using an essentially similar statistical procedure, a U-shaped curve for changes in relative risk with advancing maternal age can be demonstrated, which become more marked when contributions from the pregnancy order effect are removed (Fig. 2).

In view of the confidence limits, the pregnancy-order effect may be regarded as compatible Avith an almost linear increase in risk with each successive pregnancy, such as might be expected for effects which depend upon sensitization of the mothers by fetuses which are in some way immunologically incompatible. Such evidence alone is insufficient to distinguish causes of this particular kind, which must be regarded as essentially genetic in origin, from environmental

causes which may mimic in their effects the consequences of maternal sensitizations. Some basis for the distinction might be provided, however, by information concerning the ages of the children at the times of death, since ;the lethal effects of maternal-fetal incompatibilities would be expected to diminish in relative importance with an increasing period of survival beyond the event of birth. This kind of evidence will be discussed later.

STILLBIRTHS, CHILD HANDICAPS, AND
CHILD DEATHS
Similar statistical treatments have been applied to data from records of stillbirths, and from the birth-death and birth-handicap summary records derived by computer linkages of the appropriate registrations for children born in British Columbia in the period 1953-58 (Table
4). Stillbirths exhibited a birth-order ef-
fect essentially similar to that for infant deaths, apart from the well known special risk of stillbirth among firstborn offspring, whereas child handicaps as a group showed no such effect; somewhat unexpectedly, the child deaths, which included a substantial proportion beyond the age of one year, showed a larger increase in risk with advancing birth order than did infant deaths alone (Fig. 3, cf. Fig. 1).
Since handicaps among living children are not, for the most part, influenced by birth-order differences, it may be inferred

that neither the maternal-fetal incompatibilities, nor the environmental variables associated with birth order, are especially important in their causation. The possible exceptions to this rule, strabismus and certain other congenital malformations of the nervous system and sense organs (Newcombe and Tavendale, 1965), serve only to emphasize that such effects are either rare or, if other than rare, of slight consequence in most instances.
The increased effect of birth-order differences on the risk of child death, as compared with that of infant death, can hardly be accounted for in terms of lingering influences of events that have occurred during pregnancy, because these would be expected to diminish progressively with time. The observation implies that there must be an environmental component in the birthorder effect upon mortality, which increases beyond the first year of life. This influence can be checked directly.

* Relating to children born 1953-58. Handicap and death registrations linked by computer to the birth records of the same children.

Breakdowns of the child death data by the ages at the times of death confirm that the birth order effect is, in fact, small in the first six days of life when many of the infant deaths occur, and that it increases strikingly thereafter (Table 5 and Fig. 4). In view of the abrupt transition from a small effect in the first week to a large effect in the next

three weeks, the home environment would appear to be involved. In this connection it is noteworthy that the risk of death from infectious diseases is strongly correlated with birth order, independent of maternal age (Newcombe, 1964).
One simple explanation would be that the risk to the most recent child is in-

creased where the mother is already busy looking after a number of previously born sibs, while another would be that birth rank may be to some degree negatively correlated with socioeconomicstatus. Discrimination between these two sorts of environmental effect might be achieved by examining the risks tofirstand second-born children in relation to the numbers of later-born brothers and sisters. Such a test will become possible in the near future using the reproductive and health histories provided by the computer linkages of vital records into family groupings. Also, some evidence is available now,in that thesafest pregnancy orders, from thestandpoint of the risk of infant death, are notthe samefor mothers af all ages (Table 1). Thus, for mothers up to age 24 first births are the safest, from ages 25 to 34 second births are thesafest and, beyond that, third or fourth births are less prone to die in infancy. This suggests that child spacing prior to the current birth may be an

important factor in that part of the birth-order effect which is environmentally conditioned.
CONCLUSIONS
Genetic causes in the form of maternal sensitizations byimmunologically incompatible fetuses clearly contribute little, if anything, to the large birth-order effect upon risk of death beyond the first week of life. Neither do maternal sensitizations appear to contribute to the production of any large fraction of theregisterable handicaps of living children, for which no birth-order effect can be detected from the combined data for all causes (although a few conditionsmay be exceptional in this respect).
The possibility remains that such incompatibilities may contribute, and perhaps contribute substantially, to the increased risks of stillbirth, and of death in the first week of life, among children of the higher birth orders.
