CONSANGUINEOUS MARRIAGES IN ITALY

ITALIAN OFFICIAL STATISTICS PROVIDE in-
formation on the frequency of first cousin marriage (without specification of different mating types) and of uncle-niece and auntnephew marriage. Figures are given for different regions according to an administrative subdivision. It may be of some interest to explore what kind of information can be extracted from such data and point out at the same time their existence to students interested in human population genetics.
Table 1 gives the frequency of uncleniece, aunt-nephew and first cousin marriages contracted in 1953 in the 19 administrative regions in which the Italian territory is divided. Figure 1 shows the localization of the regions. The mean coefficient of inbreeding (a) has been calculated from the three types of marriages and

for each region and is given in Table 2. For a discussion of the genetic implications of the mean coefficient of inbreeding see Haldane & Moshinsky (1939).
Isolate size as defined by Dahlberg (1929) has been calculated from the data on first cousin marriages and of marriages to parents' sibs for each region, and is also given in Table 2.
The formulae are:
2b (b-l) n = for first cousin marriages,
and. 4b (b-l) for uncle-niece and aunt-
n = (2-{-b) c nephew marriages,
where b is the average number of marrying children per family and c is the incidence of the type of consanguineous marriage

taken into account. I take b = 2 , but this is a conservative figure for most Italian regions, since it would imply a stationary population.
Recently Morton (1955) showed that non-randomness in consanguineous marriage affects to a great extent the estimates of isolate size based on different types of consanguineous marriage. Non-randomness is evident in the case of marriages to parents' sibs, where those between uncle and niece are much more frequent than those between aunt and nephew.
Morton, using data from Austria and from Japan, showed that non-randomness is significant among different mating types of first cousin marriages and persists in the different mating types of first cousin once removed, second cousin once removed, and second cousins. Non-randomness in first cousin marriage is also evident in a series assembled by Shields and Slater (1956).
The present data confirm the discrepancy between the two mating types uncleniece and aunt-nephew. Uncle-niece marriages in 1953 in Italy are approximately 10 times more frequent than aunt-nephew

The number of potential mates for each individual should be therefore roughly between 200 and 700 in Calabria and 120 and 420 in Sicily.
