Abstract of an unpublished dissertation on file at the University of Texas, Austin, Texas, 1955

A study has been made of 2802 index cases* based upon student application and medical records at the Texas School for the Deaf in Austin, Texas to determine if there has been an increase in hereditary deaf children over the past seven decades beginning in 1881. Deafness was considered to be hereditary only if more than one member of a sibship was affected or if one or both parents of a deaf child were affected. Both dominant and recessive types of hereditary deafness were included.
It was found that the proportion of index cases in families containing hereditary deaf children produced by hearing parents among all index cases of relevant size in the school has not increased, while the proportions of index cases in families containing hereditary deaf children produced by one or two deaf parents among all index cases in the school have shown a slight increase.
It was found that deaf persons marry less frequently than do hearing and that they marry later when they do marry. Deaf parents of hereditary deaf children have comparatively smaller family sizes than do hearing parents of deaf children.
*Each index case consists of the eldest affected member of a sibship.

A definite positive selection of deaf persons by other deaf in marriage was found.
It is doubtful that increases in the proportion of index cases produced by one or two affected parents could have taken place by the production of deaf children by deaf parents generation upon generation in view of the reduced fecundity of the deaf. Such increases may be accounted for by the additional production of families having at least one deaf child by one or two deaf parents who were themselves the children of hearing parents.
Earlier workers predicted the number of deaf persons would increase rapidly as a consequence of additional deaf children produced by matings between two deaf persons. The fact that the rate of increase is only slight may be explained by the comparatively low probability of matings between the hereditary deaf since (according to this study) the hereditary deaf make up only about 35% of all deaf.
Rapid increase in the proportion of hereditary deafness may yet come about in the future as the reduction of environmental causes increases the probability of matings between hereditary types.
