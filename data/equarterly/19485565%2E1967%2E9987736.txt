INTRODUCTION
Sex-linked defects in color vision (color blindness) have become fairly well established as anthropological marker traits, despite the fact that they are pathological. Their advantages and disadvantages are discussed by Post (1962) and Kalmus (1965), who also review considerable population data and comment on the prevailingly higher frequencies among various Caucasian and Far Eastern populations in contrast with lower frequencies among populations having shorter neolithic and post-neolithic histories. The slightly lower frequencies of Japan contrasted with China, and of Britain contrasted with France, are consistent with the somewhat shorter histories of neolithic civilization of each of these insular nations contrasted with its neighboring mainland (Post, 1963). Considering the above statements, it would be rather significant to compare the frequencies of defects in color vision in Korea, which is a peninsula, with those of neighboring China and Japan and to compare all three rates with those for color blindness in islands almost isolated sociogeographically from the mainland of Korea.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
To compare color blindness in Korean island population with that found on the mainland, five islands (Figure 1)

were chosen because these particular islands are far off the coast and infrequent transportation between islands and Korea is provided so that the personal migration between them has not been significant. The city of Seoul was selected as the representative area for the inland population.
Three thousand four hundred eleven children in seven elementary, middle and high schools in Seoul and 9,181 children on five islands were investigated. They were in an age range from 9 to 22. Only

one member of each sib was examined within a school. Ishihara plates (40th edition, 1962) were used. Any subject suspected of defective color vision was retested a few days later. All failures and all doubtful cases were then tested with H-R-R Pseudo-isochromatic plates (American Optical Company), which are designed to define the subtypes of defectives. Doubtful cases were asked to describe the shape, number and location of the pertinent figure on each plate, tracing the line with a fine brush.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The results of the studies of children in Seoul and on the islands are presented in Table 1.
Taking the male rate of 0.055 in the Seoul population as the best estimate of gene frequency (pooling abnormal protan and deuteran alíeles, and disregarding the female rate), this Korean sample falls only slightly below the national average of China but well above that of Japan. Based upon aggregate samples of 67,155 and 260,284 respectively, as reported by various authors, the national averages of China and Japan are estimated as 0.040 and 0.058 by Post (1963). This relationship in the gene frequencies of the three countries corresponds to the antiquity of their cultural prehistories subsequent to hunting and gathering times, in conformity with Post's ob-

servations (1963) and discussion regarding China and Japan, since the lag of Korea behind China in prehistoric culture was consistently less than that of Japan.
On the other hand, consistently low frequencies of color blindness in four islands, displaying rates of only 0.0424, 0.0426, 0.0451, and 0.0339, have been detected through the investigation, and these rates are not consistent with that of inland Korea (X2 = 6.45), but rather with that of Japan. The great deviation of the islands from inland Korea and their close homogeneity with Japan also should be explained by Post's statement since the lag in prehistoric culture on these islands is similar to that of Japan.
Many workers have described their estimates of the higher rate of deuterans compared to protans; about four times and twice the rates of protans can be observed in inland Korea and on the islands, respectively. More extended studies for the investigation of the phenomenon that the proportion of protans to deuterans on the islands is less than that in inland Korea should be developed in the near future, giving special consideration to the gene interactions between protan and deuteran.
SUMMARY
Examination for the defects in color vision was made of students from the

Seoul area and from several islands isolated from inland Korea. Three thousand four hundred eleven children in Seoul and 9,181 children on islands were tested for color vision by using Ishihara's and H-R-R Pseudo-isochromatic plates.
In the present studies, 5.5 percent of the Seoul male population and 3.9 percent of that in the islands were defined as color-blind. Between those two populations there was a significant difference in the frequencies. Such an inconsistency should be caused by the deviation in the frequency of deuterans in each popula-

tion since the difference between rates of protans in the populations was rather negligible. As Post has stated, the lagging of the prehistoric culture to theislands would result in such a low frequency of the defects in color vision.
