The age of marriage is the product of individual decisions to marry at a particular age. These individual decisions are influenced by various factors, both social and economic. Marriage, in turn, brings about a significant change in the individual's life, so that the age at which a person marries has a series of implications, both for the individual and the society. A few of these concomitants of the age at marriage will be analyzed for the United States in this paper. The analysis is undertaken in the context of the sharp decline in the age at marriage in the United States during the decade of 1940-50 and a slight continuation of the trend during the subsequent period.1
PREMARITAL PREGNANCY
Increasingly associated with the marriage pattern in the United States is premarital conception, which takes place in about one out of five marriages (Monahan, 1960, p. 145). Though not so frequent as in Scandinavian countries and certain other parts of Europe, it is sufficiently common to be considered in connection with the age at marriage. Moreover, the proportion of marriages

with premarital conception is on the increase in the United States as revealed by the data on the intervals between marriage and the birth of the first child. The children born within eight months after marriage may be regarded as the outcome of premarital conception. Among women married in 1940-44 there were 80 such births per thousand marriages (Table 1.) In 1955-59 the number of births within eight months rose to 160, indicating that the rate of premarital conception had doubled. Indices of the ratio of the number of first births within eight months to first births within 18 and 84 months are also shown in the table for each cohort of marriages. An increase of either index indicates that premarital conceptions have risen faster than the overall rate of marital childbearing as measured by the number of first births.
Some form of inverse relationship of premarital conception with the marriage rate is apparent from the data, as can be seen from the rates given in the last row of Table 1. The low marriage rates of the period 1930-34 were accompanied by relatively high premarital pregnancy; and the latter reached a relatively low level during the 1940's, when the marriage rates attained their peak. The subsequent decline of the marriage rate was accompanied by a rise in premarital conception. This suggests that premarital pregnancy tends to counterbalance the fluctuations in the marriage rate by

forcing some of the postponed marriages to take place in periods when general conditions are less favorable for marriage.
A few other studies have shown that premarital pregnancy bears an inverse relationship to age at marriage. It is most common in early marriages, say for wife's age below 18, and drops sharply as the age at marriage advances.2 This helps to explain the rise in premarital conception accompanying the decline in the age at marriage after 1940, a trend which continued until the latest year of available data. Even without any further change in the proportions marrying at various ages, the average registered age at marriage is likely to decline further in the coming years. This will be so as the inflated cohorts of children born during the "baby boom" period, which immediately followed the end of World War II, enter the young

marriageable ages.3 As a result, premarital pregnancy may continue to rise in the near future.
LABOR FORCE
The labor force participation of women is a function of both the age at marriage and the duration of marriage. With the exception of women marrying at age 17 or earlier, the pattern of labor force participation by duration of marriage is fairly uniform for all marriage ages. Irrespective of the age at marriage, they all start with relatively high labor force participation during the first two years of marriage; the proportion drops sharply during the next three years and declines further during the five years following (Table 2 and Fig. 1). However, marked variations exist in the actual levels of participation rates of women by age at marriage, for each of the marriage durations within the first five years. During these periods of marriage,

the labor force participation increases with the later age at marriage, until it stabilizes at a fairly high level for those marrying at age 21 and above. After the first five years of marriage, the differential in the labor force participation by age at marriage is not very great, and ultimately tails off. Early marriages, therefore, can be regarded as having an adverse effect on the labor force participation of women in two ways. First, single women have substantially higher participation rates in the labor force com-

pared to their married counterparts, age by age, except for those below 18 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1953, pp. 83-84). Secondly, those who marry earlier, especially before age 21, experience comparatively much lower participation in the labor force during their first five years of marriage. The earlier marriages of the recent period are, therefore, not without significant loss of labor force to the nation.
An intervening variable affecting the labor force participation of women by both age at marriage and duration of marriage is fertility, or the proportion of women with at least one child. The sudden drop in the labor force participation of women during the two to four years from marriage can be partly explained by a corresponding rise in the proportion of women with children during this period (Table 3). Similarly, the decline in the proportion of women with at least one child with the increase in the age at marriage is capable of explaining, to some extent, the higher labor force participation during the first five years of marriage among women marrying later. If the very early marriages are in many cases forced by illicit conception, as has

been observed, then the wife is in no good position to accept employment for some period after marriage. This is indicated by the very low participation of women in the labor force at the short duration of marriage for the very early marriages. A great deal depends too on the lack of opportunities for employment in those ages without the training and skills necessary for any kind of vocation.
Not only do women marrying early more often have at least one child, but the total number of children they have within almost any duration of marriage is greater. This is seen in Table 3 from the proportion of women with three or more children. Early marriage is, therefore, also associated with higher fertility.
EDUCATION
In the analysis of the relationship between education and the age at marriage it is customary to use education as the independent variable.4 However, inter-
4The relationship has been found to be Ushaped curvilinear, with the lowest median age at first marriage for both males and females with one to three years of high school education (Glick, 1957, p. 115).

esting results are obtained by treating the age at marriage as the independent variable and comparing the average educational attainments of individuals marrying at different ages. For this it is necessary to control the present age. Information in this form, to the extent available, has been compiled for women in Table 4. It shows that, for any given group of present ages, the later the age at marriage of women, the higher is the average education generally. Also among women with the given age at marriage, those with higher present age have somewhat lesser degree of education. This indicates an increase in the level of education for successive cohorts of women and shows that the pattern of continuing education after marriage is not very prevalent among women, except perhaps to a small extent among marriages occurring before age 17. There is, therefore, no doubt that the present trend toward earlier marriage is not without its negative influence on the educational standards of the population in general.

STABILITY OF MARRIAGE
The very stability of marriage is related to the age at marriage. The marriages at younger ages are by and large more unstable compared to those at more mature ages. This is seen in Table 5, which shows the percent of ever married women living with their first husband by the ageat first marriage, for different marriage cohorts of white and nonwhite women. The percent in unbroken first marriages is smaller for women married at earlier ages for each of the marriage cohorts, and in general, the earlier the marriage the smaller is its chance of surviving from such hazards as divorce and separation. Widowhood, on the other hand, comes to women who married later in life more often than to those who married earlier, for corresponding durations of marriage. This seems to account for therelatively lower percentages of unbroken marriages for

a few of the older ages at marriage in each marriage cohort. This effect ofthe age at marriage on widowhood becomes increasingly more prominent aswemove toward earlier marriage cohorts. The greater instability of youthful marriages is seen among both whites and nonwhites, though between the two racesthe data also reveal higher instability of marriages among the latter.
CONCLUSIONS
The decline in the ageat marriage in the United States during the last two decades has been associated with several related phenomena. Premarital pregnancy, for example, hasincreased during the last few decades, being more common in early marriages. Since the average age at marriage is likely to register further decline in the United States when the children born during the postwar "baby-boom" enter young marriageable

ages, premarital pregnancy is likely to continue to rise.
In addition, the changing age at marriage is associated with the labor force participation of women in a complex way. First, single women have substantially higher participation rates in the labor force compared tomarried women, for each age except those below 18. Secondly, those who marry earlier, especially before age 21, exhibit much lower labor force participation rates during their first five years of marriage. However, there is an intervening variable in this relationship, namely, the role of children. Women marrying at an earlier agemore often have had at least one child for each marriage duration. This fact helps to account for their lower rates of participation in the labor force.

Furthermore, women marrying early characteristically have lesser education, and the pattern of continuing education after marriage does notseem to be prevalent among American women.
Finally, the stability of marriage itself is related to the age at marriage. The younger marriages have less chances of survival from the hazards of divorce or separation.
