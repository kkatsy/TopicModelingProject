Use of education as one of the major variables in studies of differential fertility has become a standard practice. Occupation and income are other important variables, but ordinarily they are used to describe characteristics of the head of the household or of the chief income recipient. These variables are powerful but somewhat less direct determinants of a woman's status. Analysis in terms of education can be carried out in a straightforward manner simply because a woman can always be identified by her educational attainment, measured in terms of highest degree of school completed. Further, unlike occupation or income, education is a fairly stable characteristic; therefore comparisons over time can be made with less ambiguity. Occupational mobility and increase in income are phenomena that may take place any time during one's economically active life, whereas educational achievement rarely changes after a certain age is reached. For example, women of a given age and occupational category at a certain instant of time have probably had during their life cycle widely .divergent occupational experiences which must have exerted unequal influences on their reproductive patterns. Education, on the other hand, is relatively free from these problems.
By virtue of the simplicity inherent in education as a variable, it becomes possible to include all or ever-married or currently married women in a study on

fertility. However, this research is restricted only to those women who are married once and are living with their husbands. This has been done for operational simplicity and for comparative studies because precisely the same group of women has also been cross-classified with respect to other socioeconomic variables. This is not a serious limitation since such women constitute about 86% of all women who are presently married.
The data used in this study have been obtained from the one in one thousand sample for the 1960 census and from published reports for the previous censuses. Table 1 illustrates the changes in educational composition of white women during the past decade.
The proportion of women in age range 20 or over who have no or little education increases with age for both the years, but at a much lower level in 1960. A similar phenomenon was observed when the 1950 figures were compared with the preceding census. The percentages, showing 1 to 3 years of high school education have changed very little during the decade. Four years of high school education appears to be the mode which for the age-range 20-44 accounts for more than 40% of all women, with little variation from one age-group to another. Improvements in this category are noticeably high for all ages and especially at ages 35 and above. College education is also becoming more and more popular.
It may be mentioned that a comparison like this will always show improve-

ments whenever the earlier records show a decline with age. If the proportion aged 20-24 is higher than, say, those aged 30-34 in 1950, the 1960-1950 comparison between age-groups 30-34, being equivalent to comparing the survivors of age-group 20-24 after ten years with those who were 30-34 ten years ago, will in all probability show an increase, since mortality is hardly selective to affect this pattern. In fact, at any instant of time differences in educational attainment by age-groups measure differential opportunities available to different birth cohorts.
Comparisons over censuses also provide opportunities to validate or reject hypotheses regarding secular movements. For example, if the amount of education is something which one receives relatively early in life (excluding, however, higher education), then a given birth cohort should be expected to show stability at least after a certain age. In other words, the 1950 age-cohort of, say, 25-29 should closely approximate the 35-39 age-cohort of 1960, and so on. This is fairly so at the high school level or 1

to 3 years of college education. The difference is highest for women aged 1519 in 1950 for all groups. This may not appear to be unlikely, in view of the relatively young age.
There is, however, a uniform reduction of 5 to 6% for women aged 20 and above in the "none or elementary group" as they get older by ten years. Apparently, it may seem that these women have moved up the educational ladder during the ten-year period. This however is unlikely, unless there has been a successful adult-education program throughout the country. Remembering the fact that in both these years the figures correspond to women who are married once and are still living with their husbands, the apparent discrepancy can be resolved if it can be found that the marriages that took place during this period were upwardly biased toward higher educational categories. That this is so can be seen from Table 2, where the distributions by education for the age-groups 30-34 in 1950 and 40-44 in 1960 have been compared and adjustments made for the recent marriages

which are roughly equivalent to those women aged 40-44 in 1960 with marriage duration of ten years or less.
For any educational group, the change over the decade is the result of a gain by new marriages and a loss by dissolution of marriages through death, divorce, etc. At the last census, 267,000 women aged 40-44 reported a marriage duration of ten years or less. That these marriages were unequally distributed among the educational groups is quite clear from Table 2. The last two groups suffered a net loss and the first three have gained,

the gain being substantial for the highest educational group. There is a net decline of 22,000 for the entire age-group and, considering the new marriages, total dissolutions during the decade amounts to at least 289,000 (excluding the marriages that were both consummated and dissolved during the decade). Assuming that the total dissolutions can be distributed pro rata, the distribution of women who, in 1960, have retained their marital status of 1950 has been presented in column 4. This assumption may appear to be somewhat restrictive in the sense that dissolution rates are higher in lower education categories. But for a rough estimate, as attempted here, such refinement is unnecessary, particularly because the main point has been established by a direct comparison of the two distributions. Differences between the figures in the last two columns reveal in relative terms that fewer first marriages take place in upper agebrackets for women low in educational attainment.
For the nonwhites, the distribution by education assumes the pattern shown on Table 3.

The proportion with no or elementary education has declined considerably over the decade. But this clustering of nonwhites in 1960 largely exceeds the corresponding concentration of whites in 1950. Compared with 1940, however, 1960 nonwhites are found to be relatively more literate than 1940 whites. It is possible that the differences, at least in the lower level of education, will be smaller and smaller in the future. The immediate effect of increased literacy is manifest in higher proportions in one to three years of high school, which for the first time exceeds the corresponding proportions of whites for the entire agebracket 15-44.
The upward movement has continued throughout the educational ladder, but the rates are relatively lower for the two upper groups. Increase in four years of high school education also deserves particular attention.
EDUCATION OF WOMEN AND NUMBER
OF CHILDREN BORN
Differential fertility by age and educational categories may be examined from Table 4.

Inverse relation between education and cumulative fertility is quite apparent. During the decade, however, there has been a general increase in fertility for all age and educational groups, and the pattern of this change is far from uniform. In 1950, the difference in cumulative fertility between the highest and lowest education groups went up and up with age of women.
Thus, on an average, women with no or elementary education had a higher reproduction rate, regardless of age. In fact, the total difference between the average number of children born ranged from a minimum of 0.5 for the 15-19 age-group to a maximum of 1.6 for women 45-49 years old. For the year 1960, the difference begins with a minimum of 0.4 at age 15-19, reaches a maximum of 1.4 at 25-29, declines to 0.7 in the next age-group, and again increases to 1.0 for women aged 45-49. Clearly, this was due to a relatively higher rate of increase in cumulative fertility for women in the highest than for those in the lowest educational group.
If the 1950 cohorts are followed till

1960 and if the differences between the total number of children born are calculated for those who were aged, say, 2024 in 1950 and 30-34 in 1960, the figures in Table 5 will be obtained.
The reader is reminded that women aged, say, 30-34 in 1960 are not strictly comparable to those aged 20-24 in 1950. A large part of the former group, however, comprise the latter in the sense that they survived from death or broken marriage or did not move up the educational ladder. The remainder were those who married after the 1950 census was taken. But late marriages, which generally take place more in upper educational categories, also reduce the exposure to pregnancy during any given time period. Assuming therefore that the confounding effect of these factors is relatively small on the general pattern of reproduction, the figures demonstrate a definite reversal in the trend of crosssectional fertility. Thus while it is true that in both the censuses education and fertility are inversely related for all ages, the number of children born during the decade is positively associated with the mothers' education, except, however, in the lowest category. (Even here women with minimum education have borne fewer children during the ten-year period than those who are the most educated.) It is possible that women down the educational axis have given birth at a rela-

tively younger age to larger numbers of children as against the educated women who preferred to distribute their pregnancies over larger intervals.
A projection of cohort fertility based on reproductive behavior during the last decade may be interesting. The assumption is that women of 1960 age-cohorts continue to reproduce at the rate of 1950-1960. Accordingly, women who will move to age-groups 40-44 and 4549 during the present and the following decade, while retaining their present marital status, will have children as shown in Table 6.
Thus, if the general pattern of completed fertility classified by years of school completed remains the same during the next 15 years, the continuation of current fertility pattern will raise the completed family size by unity regardless «3f the mother's educational achievement. Mothers in the age-group 40-44 in 1980 will be giving birth to three children, if they have had the highest education. Correspondingly, those with minimum education will, on an average, bear four children during their reproductive period. The other educational categories lie between these two extremes.
Changes in reproductive pattern of the nonwhites may be seen in Table 7.
Increase in fertility, regardless of education, is quite apparent. It may be ob-

served that in 1950 the cumulative fertility for the age-group 40-44 was the highest (even higher than 45-49). In 1960, the corresponding age-group has receded by ten years. Thus, mothers aged 30-34 have borne more children than mothers in any other age-group, with one exception for those with a college education of one to three years, where the figure is quite off the mark (and hence doubtful) when compared with the row or the column. For all other educational categories, the figures are surprisingly high and in fact show a reverse trend with increase in age through-

out the remainder of the fertile period. For the nonwhites, college education of one to three years appears to be more favorable to motherhood than four years of high school education in 1960, while the reverse was true in 1950. For the whites, fertility and education are inversely related, and until 1950 this was so for the nonwhites as well. It appears that education used as a dassificatory variable would produce sharper stratification for the nonwhites than for the whites since the former have begun to move up in that dimension relatively recently. Thus highly educated non-

whites may have values and life aspirations identical to corresponding whites, but at the bottom of the scale the two races will show characteristic dissimilarity. Accordingly, theorizations relating fertility and education should find clearer demonstrations among nonwhites than among whites. The failure of the present data to conform to that pattern may tempt researchers to hunt for possible interpretations, but this may better be postponed until the next census is taken.
PLACE OF RESIDENCE
Differentials in the total number of children born may be seen in Table 8. Although urbanites are disproportionately well educated, this comparison makes more sense than using occupation as a classificatory variable, because most of the occupational groupings are

either characteristically rural or characteristically urban.
Cumulative fertility is therefore lowest in urban and highest in rural farm areas for all age and education categories. However, the difference between the two extreme education categories is minimum in urban areas and quite large in rural farm areas and in between are rural nonfarm areas. In other words, for any age-group, increasing trend in number of children born with decline in educational attainment is most prominent in rural nonfarm and least in urban areas. Further, each of these trends has the same starting point since women who have four and more years of college education show very little difference in cumulative fertility, regardless of their place of residence. The disparity between urban and nonurban areas increases as the women are followed further down the educational level. Com-

Education and Fertility

221

paring rural nonfarm with rural farm areas, one may see that the gap widens and subsequently narrows down, and quite often the direction is reversed, indicating thereby that fertility differentials between these two areas are virtually nonexistent for women who have the least education.
In urban areas, number of children ever born per woman aged 40-44 ranges from a minimum of 2.3 for the highest to a maximum of 2.7 for the lowest educational category. Corresponding numbers for rural nonfarm and rural farm areas are 2.3, 3.6 and 2.5, 3.8, respectively. It is hardly necessary to speculate over why education acts as a stabilizer against environmental variations and why the least educated nonurbanites

have given birth to one more child than their urban counterparts. '·

INTERCENSAL INCREASE

It will be interesting to observe how these women compare with their tenyear-older cohorts ten years ago. Relative increases in cumulative fertility over this period, for white women only, may be seen in Table 9.
Barring a few negative figures, the percentage increase is sufficiently large for all age-groups and places of residence. Older women (40-49) with less education (one to three years of high school or less) show little increase and account for most of the negative figures (or decline in fertility). Even if these

fluctuations be assumed random, the conclusion follows that these women have reacted quite differently than those belonging to other age-cohorts and/or educational categories.
For the "none or elementary" group the percentages decline progressively over age, while this is not so for the rest of the categories. For college-educated women, the fluctuations are rather irregular, but on an average the percentage increases for these women are larger than the corresponding increases in the lowest education category.
Except in a few cases, urban areas show a larger percentage increase in cumulative fertility than rural areas, and rural nonfarm areas generally occupy an intermediate position. The larger increase in urban areas is however due to a smaller base in 1950; and in absolute numbers, cumulative fertility in urban areas is yet the lowest for all age and education categories. Grabill et al. (1958) observed that "the increases in fertility that occurred during 1940 to 1950 were such as to bring a narrowing of the differentials in fertility by education of the women." Evidently, this has continued through 1960, but the effect is more visible in urban than in other areas. It seems that at the present rate differentials will continue to remain significant for some time in the future.

Only women who are married once arid living with their husbands have been considered for operational simplicity. Such women, it may be mentioned, constitute 86% of those who are presently married.
Composition of women by education has undergone significant upward movement during the last decade. This is true for all ages and for both whites and nonwhites. In 1950, only 15% of white women aged 25-29 had some college education as against 23% in 1960. Fifty % of the nonwhite women in the same age-group had no or elementary education in 1950 and just in a matter of a decade the figure has declined to 26%.
Inverse relationship between education and cumulative fertility continued to persist in 1960, but with reduced intensity. For all age and education groups fertility has increased, and often the absolute increase has been found to be directly related with education. The gap between highest and lowest educational categories has thus been reduced. White women aged 35-39 had on an average 2.5 to 3.2 children down the education axis in 1960. Corresponding range in 1950 was 1.7 to 2.9. Nonwhite women also exhibit similar decline in fertility differentials. This narrowing down of fertility differentials is more visible in urban than in rural areas.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
The reproductive performance of women has been studied for the year 1960, with education as the principal classificatory variable. Data used for this analysis have been obtained from one in one thousand sample of the 1960 census.
