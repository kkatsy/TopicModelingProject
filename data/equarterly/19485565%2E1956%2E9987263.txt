LXHEUMATIC FEVER IS AN IMPORTANT, relatively common disease having its usual onset in childhood. The heart is usually affected. (1) It has been estimated that for each death of a person under 20 years of age due to the combined causes of pertussis, diphtheria and poliomyelitis, there were 50 deaths due to rheumatic heart disease (2).
The etiology of rheumatic fever is obscure, and its incidence in the population is not obtainable. As it is a disease which appears to "run in families," the family unit has offered the best approach for genetic studies.
It is an accepted fact that certain individuals are more susceptible than others to the acquisition of many diseases. In recent years it has become clear that the character of the host is one important factor in resistance and susceptibility. The biological pattern of development of an individual is determined both by his hereditary constitution and his environment during his life experience.
For more than fifty years the clinical impression that heredity is a significant factor in the concentration of rheumatic fever in certain families has been widespread. This belief was based in large measure on the observed familial incidence of the disease (3).
There have been several family studies in rheumatic fever. These have considered the relative roles of environment, contagion, and heredity as factors responsible for the high familial incidence of the disease. More recent family studies have

demonstrated a higher degree of familial association in families with parental rheumatism, and a greater frequency of cases among the progeny of rheumatic families than controls.
Modern Genetic Theory
The study of human heredity as a medical subject is a relatively new field. In the past there have been a number of purely genetic studies on rare conditions. In recent years, medical genetics has assumed a prominent place in clinical investigations. The application of genetic techniques to human material involves certain difficulties but is not, for the most part, beyond clinical medicine. The reasoning is simple and the arithmetical details are easy to follow and apply.
Many conditions appear to "run in families," and the observed familial incidence cannot be considered as conclusive evidence for heredity. The attempt to link heredity with familial incidence has been associated with the concept of constitution which embraces a variety of poorly defined traits. Modern genetic theory refers to explicit cellular and functional attributes and properties whose precursors have a concrete and real existence in the germ cells and the soma.
Fundamentally, all statements about heredity refer to the chromosomes upon which the genes are located. Variations in the mechanism of heredity depend on processes associated with the maturation of the germ cells and the fertilized egg. Inasmuch as all hereditary characters probably

depend upon the effect of a variety of exogenous factors for their somatic expression, hereditary traits may be variable in the time and degree of their expression. Not infrequently they may fail to be expressed altogether, even though the host may be genetically susceptible. It is therefore essential to evaluate the effect of nongenetic factors, environmental, dietary, or bacterial.
In the study of any hereditary condition, the pattern of inheritance is described in terms of some one of the known mechanisms of inheritance in man (4, 5). By the use of appropriate formulas which have been derived on the basis of experimental studies, the theoretical distribution of susceptible individuals in a series of human families is made and compared with the actual observation for each family size. If agreement is obtained, the data are considered to be consistent with the hypothesis postulated. Consistency with a postulated mechanism is not in itself proof. Other mechanisms of heredity must be excluded. Significant differences between observation and expectation negate the mechanism postulated. Consistent deficiencies or excesses of cases may indicate nongenetic effects if bias in the data is excluded. For these reasons the requirements of the data suitable for application of genetic formulas are one of the most important aspects of the genetic analysis. The bias introduced and the errors of interpretation arising from a lack of recognition of these requirements in rheumatic fever data must be taken into account.
Methods of Genetic Analysis
The incidence of a disease or condition among twins is frequently used to establish the possible role of genetic factors. It would be expected that traits in which heredity plays a prominent part would not occur so frequently in both members of fraternal twins as in a pair of identical twins. Such studies have given results consistent with the hypothesis that hereditary factors

are important in rheumatic fever (6).
Various methods of genetic analysis may be utilized. A simple measure of familial association is a comparison of the ratios of affected siblings to total number of siblings for several matings. Pedigrees or family trees are frequently used to chart the descent of disease or defect in human families. This method has limitations. Estimates of affected progeny for certain common matings is presented in Table 1.

·The mating type (italicized) is the one most commonly encountered clinically for each mechanism of inheritance. Negative parents are considered carriers.

In using simple genetic ratios the assumption is made that the clinical data are representative of the matings for each type in the general population. This is rarely attained in ordinary clinical material due to bias in the selection of families for study, for in view of the small size of human families in comparison with experimental material, certain families without any positive siblings should occur in the general population by chance alone. Such families would not be represented in samples drawn from a clinic population which includes at least one case in a family.
The Lenz-Hogben Formula. The use of simple Mendelian ratios for genetic analysis may be expressed in terms of varying family size and total affected siblings by the following formula:

·Values of ft, are computed from Hogben's formula.
Values of s/l--q' have been computed from LenzHogben formula for the several values of p and q in our data; (sp/1--q' may be computed for each family size and applied as a genetic factor for prediction) .

To compute the expected number of cases in a group of rheumatic families of given size, the appropriate factor is multiplied by the number of families of that size (ns). The standard error (o2)_ is obtained by multiplying the appropriate value of ks by the number of families. For example, the expected number of cases in the two-membered families in our data is obtained by multiplying the factor 1.143 by 9, the number of two-

membered families. Its variance (o8) is obtained by multiplying 9 by 0.122. This procedure is followed for every group of families arranged according to family size and parental diagnosis. Probably the best proof of the hereditary mechanism would be available from an analysis of families selected because one or both parents were rheumatic. These data are preferable for genetic analysis since they are not biased by selection of affected children and can therefore be analysed directly by the application of simple Mendelian ratios.
Genetic Studies in Rheumatic Fever
Genetic and epidemiologic studies in 1937 and 1943 (8, 9) revealed that the distribution of cases among 471 children in 113 rheumatic families was consistent with a genetic mechanism of simple recessive inheritance. These families were selected because of the presence of at least one rheumatic child. It was concluded that hereditary susceptibility is the primary factor responsible for the concentration of rheumatic fever in certain families.
An hereditary factor in rheumatic fever has been reported by other investigators. In 1952, Gray, Quinn and Quinn reported agreement with a simple recessive gene hypothesis in 40 New Haven families similarly selected (10). There was a paucity of cases in three positive by positive matings. In a Toronto study by Uchida in 1953, it was concluded from a genetic analysis of 58 affected families that no definite mode of inheritance could be established from the limited data (11). In 1953 Stevenson and Cheeseman studied 462 families in Belfast which were ascertained by an affected child, and 51 families ascertained by an affected mother (12). It was concluded that inheritance played a major role in determining familial aggregation of cases but that a Mendelian mechanism could not be established.
Further investigation of the pattern of inheritance in rheumatic fever was under-

41

taken by Wilson and Schweitzer in 1954 (13). The families of a selected parent were brought under observation without regard for the presence or absence of rheumatic fever in the unselected mate or in collateral relatives.
Pattern of hereditary susceptibility in rheumatic fever. The genetic analysis of 109 rheumatic families in 1943 is presented in Table 3. Among fifty families in which one parent was rheumatic (p -- 0.50), the observed frequency of 117 rheumatic children is not significantly different from the expected value of 111.9 ± 6.43, the deviation being 0.79 a. In the families with two non-rheumatic parents, 101 cases among 251 offspring were observed in comparison with 90.0 ± 5.35 cases expected (p = 0.25). The deviation is on the borderline of significance, 2.06 u.
The use of the Lenz-Hogben formula to estimate the number of cases which should be observed is illustrated by this analysis. The agreement obtained, assuming theoretic frequencies of 0.25 and 0.50, constitutes presumptive evidence in favor of a simple recessive gene mechanism in

rheumatic fever. There was no agreement when mechan-
isms such as a single dominant gene, sexlinkage, two or more recessive factors, or more than two dominant factors were postulated. Although the operation of a double dominant gene was not entirely excluded, application of this hypothesis to the data gave an estimated frequency of 8 per cent for the disease in the general population, a value far higher than is estimated by current observers.
The assumption that the mechanism is a single autosomal recessive gene is consistent with the data and with the general observed incidence of the disease. It is also the simplest concept which may be postulated. It was therefore felt that for purposes of further analysis, this genetic mechanism should be assumed and, if correct, the results would substantiate it.
In our 1954 study the following analysis was made. Families of a selected parent were brought under observation without regard for the presence or absence of rheumatic fever in the unselected mate or in collateral relatives. The data were arranged

in parental mating types and appropriate Mendelian ratios applied. Standards tests for dominant, sex-linked, and recessive inheritance were done.
Genetic analysis supported the single recessive hypothesis and excluded sex linkage, dominant and multiple-gene hypotheses. A comparison of the number of cases so far observed and the number expected for different parental family types is presented in Table 4. The number expected at the present age was obtained by application of an age correction factor. There were 52 families which were considered genetically susceptible and in this group there were 40 cases observed among 121 siblings. The familial incidence was negligible in the genetically nonsusceptible families. Only 3 cases were observed among 525 children in 239 families.
It will be noted that of 49 cases finally expected, 40 have so far been observed. Since all of the siblings had not passed the peak age of onset of the disease, the data were corrected for present age. On this basis, 45 cases are expected at the attained age and 43 are observed. Good agreement is noted at the attained age of the children. A few additional cases are expected in the susceptible families as the younger children reach the ages of maximum incidence. It is unlikely that any considerable number of new cases will occur at older ages. In the earlier study, 130 individuals who were nonrheumatic at the ages of 13 to 25 years have remained non-rheumatic during 11 additional years.

Comment
Genetic analysis of human data is limited by the relatively small family size as compared with experimental material. This may preclude complete expression of an hereditary trait. In addition, diagnostic difficulties may prevent adequate ascertainment of cases. This is particularly true in the diagnosis of rheumatic fever in adults since physical signs of rheumatic heart disease often regress and childhood illness is

not accurately recalled. In the absence of a specific diagnostic test, complete reliance is frequently placed on historical information or a limited physical examination. In this study, evidence of rheumatic heart disease determined by physical, fluoroscopic and electrocardiographic examinations was required for confirmation of a diagnosis of rheumatic fever. In spite of the rigid diagnostic criteria utilized, there were probably a few errors in parental classification in

43

families where information was limited concerning collateral relatives. The continuous medical supervision of the families, the majority from infancy to past the peak age of onset, minimized possible diagnostic errors in the children.
The conclusion that the pattern of inherited susceptibility is a recessive character rests on the agreement between observation and expectation. Equally important for the interpretation of recessiveness are the observations in the lower half of Table 4 (f-h). The insignificant number of cases in 239 families where one parent is non-rheumatic and not known to have close kin who are rheumatic is strong evidence that recessive inheritance is involved.
Complete agreement with a specific hereditary mechanism may not always be obtained even in conditions of proven heredity. It is well known in experimental material that certain modifying factors, endogenous or exogenous, may influence the expression of hereditary traits. This may also occur in human disease. The differences in type and severity of manifestations of rheumatic fever among members of a family suggest differing degrees of susceptibility which perhaps reflect endogenous modifying influences. There are probably also exogenous factors which may influence the expression of the disease in a susceptible child.
The adequacy of recessive inheritance to describe the distribution of cases among these families does not exclude a more complicated mechanism. It is, however, the simplest hypothesis, requiring no additional assumptions.
The results of these investigations in two family generations support the concept of single recessive inheritance. It may be noted that the analytic procedures in the two studies were different. The procedures in the second study are more satisfactory because they do not require the statistical adjustments that must be made when the affected child is the index case. When data are collected based only on parental selec-

tion, the standard Mendelian methods of analysis are fully adequate. Where information on the antecedents of the parents is meager, statistical analysis based on estimates of population frequency is used to determine the pattern of inheritance. This method of analysis requires a series of families collected as a random sample. This important condition is not fulfilled in clinic families.
The primary role of heredity in the familial concentration of rheumatic fever has been established in this and other published investigations. These observations emphasize the importance of identifying the genetically susceptible family to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment. The medical supervision of these families affords an opportunity for investigation of the nature of the inherent factor responsible for susceptibility. They are also useful for the study of exogenous factors which may be responsible for the development of rheumatic fever in a susceptible child. Current etiologic concepts may be explored within this framework.
The demonstration of hereditary susceptibility does not exclude the operation of environmental factors. Like most published family studies, our investigations concern a clinic population which excludes families of higher economic level. The economic status and living conditions which prevailed in 1955 among the susceptible and non-susceptible families was comparable and far superior to those in the earlier study in 1943.
These studies indicate that in the general population there is a distribution of children who are susceptible or unsusceptible to rheumatic fever on a genetic basis. Genetic analysis gave good agreement with single recessive inheritance while excluding other mechanisms.
