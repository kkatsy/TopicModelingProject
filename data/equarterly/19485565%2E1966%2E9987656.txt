The development of new techniques of analyzing census returns have made it possible to make a valid estimate of child mortality independent of vital statistics data (Brass, 1963). The analysis of the Burmese census reveals that the Chinese and Indian minorities have distinctly lower child mortality rates than the Burmese population grouping.
Both Indian and Chinese groups constitute small minorities of the total population. Of the urban population in Burma in 1953 of about three million, approximately 10% were Indians and Pakistanis; about 6%, Chinese. The proportions of males in both populations is uncommonly high. In the Indian group, there were 182 males for every 100 females; in the Chinese group, 121 males for every 100 females.
Indian and Chinese minorities have been in conflict with the Burmese majority. There have been riots over job competition, particularly between Indians and Burmese. The Chinese have been in a more favorable position for several reasons. While many of the Indians came as laborers to work on the railways and in the mines, many of the Chinese came as traders, so that they hold positions in commerce and industry that have produced considerable wealth. There was some resentment of the conspicuously more prosperous position of the Chinese. About 77% of the Chinese and 56% of the Indians were engaged in commerce, industry, and transport, as against 19% of the Burmese (Andrus,

1948). The Chinese have achieved similar positions of economic strength in neighboring countries as well. In Thailand in 1947, 71% of all business owners were Chinese, although the Chinese were only 3% of the population (Coughlin, 1960). Within the framework of two foreign minorities who have a favorable economic position, it is interesting to examine the mortality differentials between these two groups and the Burmese population.
RESULTS
The most striking aspect of the results is the mortality differential among the ethnic groups: the Chinese have the lowest mortality, the Burmese, the highest. In Table 1, the urban Burmese group has a sq0 value (probability of dying between age 0 and age 5) of .352. For the urban Indians and Pakistanis, 5<7o=.275; for the urban Chinese, 5q0= .221. The Burmese have a 28% greater likelihood of dying before age 5 than have the Indians and Pakistanis and a 59% greater likelihood of death than the Chinese. At age 3, the differences are even more pronounced. The estimates are probably most accurate for ages 3 and 5.
The Indian mortality seems greatly underestimated here for the first year of life and is probably underestimated at other ages. Whether the underestimation results from easier forgetting of children who die soon after birth or to a

lesser importance attached to death of children is not clear from the data. The lower mortality rates of the Chinese may reflect their more favorable economic circumstances and may be the consequences of cultural patterns of cleanliness that promote better health.
The mortality rates for the rural village tracts is estimated here to be about 10% lower than for the urban towns. This finding is consistent with expectations due to more favorable health conditions in the rural areas prior to 1954. It is possible that part of this difference

could be accounted for by easier forgetfulness of deaths in the rural environment where burial of infants is perhaps easier and less involved with officials than in the towns.
Of the data in Table 1 and Figure 1, the xq0 values are most subject to doubt. Brass' own evaluation of his method states that the !#,, values are least valid, which is unfortunate due to the particular interest in infant mortality, and because vital statistics give parallel information on infant mortality.

infant mortality, which can be seen in Table 2.
The infant mortality was apparently diminishing rapidly during the period 1947 to 1955. In 1953, the xqa figures would result from deaths that occurred in 1952 to 1953, whereas the sq0 figures would concern deaths in the period 1948 to 1953. The isqo figures would go even further back in time, so that the mortality figures in Table 1, though derived from data collected in 1953 and 1954, actually concern mortality accumulated over the preceding years and do not represent actual mortality conditions existing in 1953 or 1954. The census-based xq0 value for the urban total of about .200 in Table 1 is somewhat low to be consistent with the reported infant mortality rate of 231 for the year 1953 in Table 2. The method employed in deriving the !q0 from census data is essentially conservative, and the values in Table 1 are plausible minimum estimates. The infant mortality rate according to vital statistics are probably overstated, for the reason, as Sundrum suggests, that "It is generally known that the under-registration of births is greater than the under-registration of deaths. If this is true also for infant deaths, the recorded infant mortality would be an

over-estimate" (Sundrum, 1957). The reduction in the infant mortality rate indicated by vital statistics between 1947 and 1955 could be partly an artifact, resulting from steady improvement in birth registration. Nevertheless, the reduction to the levels of 173 in 1955 and 126 in 1961 strongly indicate a real and rapid improvement in health conditions over the period as a whole.
METHOD
A 1953 census of 252 towns in Burma included a sample of about 300,000 evermarried women who were asked questions about numbers of children ever born and numbers of children surviving. The questions were tabulated by "race," the largest groups being the Burmese, Indians, and Chinese, and by age of mother. The children of women 15 to 20 are very young, having an average age of about 1 year. The average age of children whose mothers are 21 to 25 is about 2 years. The proportion of dead children to children ever born for mothers 15 to 20 closely approximates the infant mortality rate. Likewise, the proportion of dead to ever-born children of mothers aged 21 to 25, when adjusted by a correction factor, approximates the probability of a child's dying by age 2. The exact sizes of the correction factors depend upon the shape of the fertility curve. Brass calculated various sets of correction factors for varying shapes of the fertility curve as measured by the rx¡rít where rx equals the ratio of children ever born per woman aged 16 to 20; and r2, for women aged 21 to 25 (Brass, 1963).1

of children ever born, for each age group of mother. This proportion subtracted from 1.000 gives the figures in column (5), the proportion dying, which closely approximates the mortality rates found in column (7). The correction factors in column (6) are interpolated from Brass' tables, with the values dependent upon the shape of the fertility curve.
For the Union totals, either urban or rural, the technique poses no particular problems. The Union totals of children born and surviving are compiled by ever-married women. Since in Burma very few children are born to never-

married women, it is possible to make a fairly accurate estimate of rx¡r% with only a minor adjustment to make the 20% sample more closely conform to the census totals. Certain technical problems are posed in the breakdown by race, for the data on children ever born and surviving is tabulated only for those women married once and still married. Hence, those women divorced, widowed, or remarried and their children are left out of the data. The shape of the fertility curve must be estimated using additional information consisting of (1) age of marriage by race by children ever born and surviving; (2) Union totals

for race by age and sex; (3) Union totals for children ever born and surviving for both ever-married women and once-married women. This additional information makes it possible to approximate closely the shape of the fertility curve for each race. Confidence can be maintained in the results since the multiplying factors are fairly insensitive to small changes in the fertility measure.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to estimate the differential fertility by racial group because of the failure to include one question in the census. If the question, "How many children were born during the preceding year?" had been asked, such an estimate would be possible. It is to be hoped that sample surveys of the population in the future will ask this question as well as that about the number of children ever born and surviving.
