Both private enterprise and governmental agencies at all levels--Federal, State, and local--have come to recognize the need for an understanding of population characteristics and trends in their planning and administration. Depending upon the issues at hand, questions arise not only with regard to population size, composition, and distribution, but also on social and economic characteristics. The present paper explores the major implications that the structure and trends of the population have for health problems.
POPULATION CHANGE FROM 1940 TO 1970
Population growth: During the century ending in 1940, population growth in the United States was largely a product of a more rapid decline in the death rate than in the birth rate. Immigration was secondary to natural increase in this growth, but still an appreciable factor (1). Since 1940, the situation has changed materially. Immigration is no longer an important element in our population growth, and a sustained high birth rate, rather than further mortality reduction, has since given us a large population increase. The 1960 census of population yielded a count of more than 180,000,000, including Americans abroad (Table 1). This marked an increase of almost one-fifth since 1950. According to projections by the Bureau of the Cen-

sus, the population is expected to increase by about one-sixth in the 1960's, or to a total of around 210,000,000 by 1970. Viewed in longer perspective, a population increase of more than 50 percent is in sight for the span from 1940 to 1970, which approximates the length of a generation.
Scientific advances and recent rapid population growth have contributed to present shortages in public health and medical care facilities and personnel. Because of the increase in numbers alone, there is urgent need for an expansion in both facilities and personnel during the present decade. For example, in 1959 the country had a ratio of 141 physicians per 100,000 population (2). Simply to maintain this ratio, the number of graduates in medicine and osteopathy would have to be raised from 7,400 in 1959 to 9,600 in 1970. Merely to keep the ratio of dentists to the population near its present level of 57 per 100,000, the number of dental graduates would have to be doubled by 1975. In the case of nurses, both population growth and an increasing demand for services in the hospital, the doctor's office, and the home, and also in industry and public health have given rise to an estimate that about one-third more will be needed during the present decade (3). Closely associated with these increased needs are the corresponding requirements for more paramedical personnel at all levels of training, from the professional to the semi-skilled (4). Beyond

these needs for health personnel engaged in providing services are the; additional opportunities being created for research scientists in the medical and allied fields (5).
Changed population attitudes and growth in voluntary health insurance, as well as advances in medical care practice have led to a rise in the hospital admission rate from about 6 per 100 in 1931 to about 14 per 100 in 1960 (6). Although hospitals, nursing homes, and other medical care facilities must be accommodated to the size, characteristics, and trends of the population to be served, shifts in the patterns of disease and of patient care require important consideration in planning for economical administration. The importance of planning in order to meet population needs is clear in the implementation of the Hill-Burton program enacted in 1946 for the construction of hospitals and amended in 1954 to encourage construction of nursing homes, diagnostic or treatment centers, and rehabilitation facilities. An insight into population characteristics and trends will also be required to implement the Community Health Services and Facilities Act of 1961, with its provisions for the support of such out-of-hospital services as nursing care of the sick at home, homemaker services, and screening clinics for periodic health appraisal.2 The demographic structure and trends in localities and larger areas enter into the consideration of problems of environmental health, where the concern is essentially with preventive measures and safeguards against

pollution of the air, water, food, and

_;

Age: Since the pattern of illness and in-

jury varies strikingly with age and sex,

the structure of a population with re-

gard to these two characteristics will

bear upon its medical care and public

health programs. At the two extremes

of life--the ages under 18 years and ages

65 and over--the population in the

country increased by more than one

third from 1950 to 1960. Although

smaller rates of increase are expected

from 1960 to 1970, the gains in num-

bers will be very appreciable--almost

10,000,000 at ages under 18 years and

about 3,500,000 at ages 65 and over. The

number of young people--those at ages

18-24--actually declined from 1940 to

1960, but an increase of more than 50

percent is expected in the decade end-

ing in 1970. However, only a small in-

crease is in sight by 1970 for the num-

ber at ages 25-44. For ages 45-64, a

steady growth of somewhat over one-

sixth is in evidence for each decade from

1940 to 1970 in Table 1.

As a result of these shifts, the proportion of the total population at ages 1824 years and at ages 65 and over will rise from 1960 to 1970. On the other hand, a decrease is expected for the proportion at ages 25-44, while the proportions at ages under 18 and at ages 45-64 will be practically unchanged. With almost 30 percent of the total population at ages 45 and over during the current decade, chronic disease and mental health will continue as outstanding health problems.

Sex: The more rapid reduction in the mortality of females than of males is giving the country an increasing excess of women. However, this is not the case under age 18, which is influenced in

Demographic Spectrum

favor of males by the sex ratio at birth. For the broad range from 18-44 years, during which most marriages occur, males and females will be practically equal in number by 1970, following a 30-year period with an excess of females. Most noteworthy is the trend in the sex ratio at ages 65 and over, from 105 females per 100 males in 1940 to an estimated 132 females per 100 males in 1970. Race: A relatively high birth rate and a rapid reduction in mortality have brought the proportion of nonwhites in the population to 11.4 percent of the total in 1960, compared with 10.4 percent in 1940. Each age group shared in this rise. With a social-economic strati-

fication different from that for the white population, the nonwhites have a relatively greater concentration of the health problems usually associated with a lower level of living. However, the health situation of the nonwhites should improve the more rapidly with their economic advancement and also with an expansion of public health and medical care programs.
INFANCY AND THE SCHOOL AGES
However favorable the rates of morbidity and mortality in infancy and childhood may appear for the country as a whole, the many cases of illness and death point up important health problems. Thus, in a total population of al-

most 65,000,000 children under age 18 in 1960, there were about 150,000 deaths during the year, of which nearly three-fourths were in the first year of life. In fact, about 70,000 deaths were recorded within the first week of life. Adding to this figure the like number of fetal deaths yields an annual toll of about 140,000 perinatal deaths, with prematurity as a major factor. It has been pointed out that the rate of decrease in infant mortaliy has slackened since about 1950, and the question has been raised as to whether further substantial reductions can be realized until significant gains are made with such problems as prematurity, congenital malformations, and other conditions associated with early infancy (8).
For children under 15 years of age, the National Health Survey recorded recently 2,158,000 impairments, or at a rate of 41.0 per 1,000 persons in that age group (9). Over one-third of these were orthopedic impairments, over one-fourth involved speech, nearly one-sixth related to hearing, and one-twelfth were visual. The same source also shows that more than one-sixth of the children under 15 years had some chronic condition; for eight percent of those affected, the condition involved some limitation of activity.
Data from the Crippled Children's Program of the Children's Bureau are also indicative of the magnitude of the problem of chronic conditions and physical impairments in early life (10). This program reported that 339,000 children under age 21 years, or 4.9 per 1,000, were under care in 1959. Here also congenital malformations play an important role, accounting for more than one-
fourth of the cases. Nearly one-fifth of
the cases were attributed to diseases of
the bones and organs of movement;

other conditions of appreciable frequency were cerebral palsy, crippling due to poliomeylitis, disorders of the eye and hearing, and impairments from accidents. Many of these crippled and handicapped children owe their survival to improved pédiatrie care. For such handicapped children, their schooling may also lead to emotional problems if they are treated difierently from the others. Also important among children are problems of dental health, nutrition, safety in a wide variety of circumstances, physical fitness, and the growing incidence of venereal disease (11).
Such, in brief, are the major health issues in a child population increasing by an average of about 1,000,000 each year during the current decade. With the child as the focus, the issues involve the family, the physician, and both voluntary and public community agencies, particularly the school. Each has a vital part in an integrated program for child health and welfare.
EDUCATION
An educated public is highly healthconscious. Through articles on health in newspapers, magazines, and other mass-media, the public soon becomes aware of new medical and public health problems and of the scientific findings that may benefit health status. Such a public is receptive to improved public health and medical care services, especially those made known through community health education, and is also concerned with any undue lag in the application of new knowledge (12).
An index to the rise in the educational status of our adult population is provided by the median school years completed by those aged 25 years and over. This median rose from 8.6 years in 1940 to 10.6 years in I960, and the outlook

Demographic Spectrum

is for a further rise to 12.0 years by 1970 (13). Contributing to this rise are increasing proportions enrolled in school, particularly at the early adult ages. Largely because of compulsory requirements, practically all children at ages 6-15 years are in school. At ages 16-17 years, the proportion increased from 68 percent in 1947 to 83 percent in 1959. Even at ages 25-29 years, there was a rise from 3 percent to 5 percent for the same period. Also noteworthy is the rise of 5-year-old children in kindergarten from 53 to 63 percent (14).
These increasing numbers and proportions of young people in school emphasize the role of school health programs in the national well-being. Although some generalities may be set out for such programs, they must necessarily be adapted to local circumstances and characteristics of the population served. The school offers unique opportunities for observing and securing care for health problems and remedial defects, for the formation of health habits, and for inculcating lifetime health attitudes.
Currently there is frequent reference to shortages of personnel with professional and sub-professional training. The principal ages at which such skills are acquired fall in the 18-24 year range, where an increase of over 8,000,000 is expected from 1960 to 1970. If the proportions remaining in school continue to rise, these shortages may be alleviated in some degree; the health professions and allied occupations will naturally look for their fair share (16).
MARRIAGE AND THE FAMILY
Both morbidity and mortality data indicate a better health status for the married than for the unmarried (17). This is usually attributed to selective factors; many in a seriously impaired

state of health elect to stay out of marriage and others in poor physical condition, but willing to marry, are passed by. Marriage is also presumed beneficial to emotional health and offers the advantage of family care to a spouse in case of illness.
The advantages of family life have been accruing to increasing proportions of the population since 1940, as evident in Table 2. For example, the proportion of young women at ages 18-24 years who are married rose from 42.5 percent in 1940 to 55.5 percent in 1961. Over the same period, the proportion of married men at ages 25-44 years increased from 75.6 percent to 83.7 percent. However, it may be asked whether the selective factors related to health have weakened with the rapid rise in proportions married, particularly in view of the marked reduction in average age at marriage (18). Not only have the proportions married increased, but also the proportions with dependent children. In the short period from 1952 to 1960, the proportion of husbands at ages 25-44 years with dependent children under 18 years rose from 79.1 percent to 86.3 percent.
Improved chances of survival have increased the average length of married life and, by the same token, have decreased sharply the proportion of families broken prematurely by the death of a spouse. This, in turn, has greatly reduced the social and economic burden of orphanhood, with its attendant health problems (19). However, the more rapid improvement in the chances of survival for women than for men has increased the probability that a wife will outlive her husband; in other words, the chances of eventual widowhood have increased. Moreover, the average length of widowhood has also increased with improvement in longevity.

At the older ages--65 and over--in 1961, only 37.4 percent of the women were married, compared with 72.3 percent for men, as Table 2 shows. This differential is produced not only by the greater likelihood of widowhood for women (since they have the lower mortality and are usually younger than their husbands), but also by the higher re-

marriage rates for widowers than for widows (20). The advantage of family life for older men is also evident in their living arrangements. Thus, 83.5 percent of the men were living in families in 1961, but for women the proportion was only 67.6 percent. Of these older persons living in families, those who had lost their spouse still had the advantage

of care by another relative (21).
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
Issues of health in relation to economic activity arise at most stages of life, even before entry into the labor force. An unhealthy or physically handicapped youngster would hardly prepare for a strenuous occupation. In fact, it is not at all unusual for industry to set some minimum physical requirements to applicants for employment. For the working years of life, health programs of industry, government, and voluntary agencies are geared to problems of accident prevention, the control of occupational disease, and general health maintenance. Finally, discussions of health problems during the later years have a role in preretirement programs offered by some companies (22). The magnitude of these issues depends on the numbers and characteristics of the population involved and also upon the changes in the patterns of industry.
Most men up to 65 years are in the labor force. For ages 65 and over, the proportion has been declining steadily due to the shift from agricultural to nonagricultural occupations, the movement from rural to urban areas, and the development of our Social Security program and of private pension plans. For women, labor force participation rates have been moving upward at all but the young ages, where they are starting family life. For both sexes, the outlook is that these trends will continue (23).
Although most males at the prime ages are in the labor force, the participation rates are greater for the married than for the single--most likely a reflection of their better health status and a sense of family responsibility. For example, in 1960 the labor force participation rates for males at ages 25-44 years

were 98.7 percent for those married with their spouse present, and 90.5 percent for the single, while the others had a midway rate of 94.7 per cent (Table 3). As expected, the pattern of labor force participation is quite different for women, family responsibility keeping the rate low for the married and the need for self-support making it high for the unmarried. Most men under 65 work fulltime, but about one-fourth of the women workers of that age period are on a parttime basis (24).
The upward trend in labor force participation by women was shared by the married and also by those who had been married and had dependent children with them, as evident in Table 4, where 1951 and 1960 are compared. The only category of women not sharing in this rise are those who had been married but were separated, divorced, or widowed at the time of the survey and had no dependent children present.
In 1960, 18.6 percent of the married women with dependent children under 6 years of age were in the labor force; the proportion was 39.0 percent where the dependent children were all over 6 years of age. Substantially higher are the proportions for women with dependent children but without their husbands --39.8 percent where the children were under 6 years of age and 66.2 percent where all were over 6 years. For these sizable proportions of mothers at work there are important problems in the health care of their children during their absence; they may also experience strains on their own physical resources in tending to both their jobs and their homes.
The postwar era has witnessed the introduction of new and complex industrial and agricultural processes, new types of industries, and a growth of serv-

168 Spiegelman

ices in health, education, and recreation. With these developments has come a shift in the occupational structure of the working population. Between 1947 and 1960, the proportion of employed persons engaged in white collar occupations rose from 35 to 43 percent and those in service occupations from 10 to 13 percent (25). Meanwhile, the proportions in blue collar occupations fell from 41 to 36 percent and those in farm occupations from 14 to 8 percent. There are

marked variations according to age and sex in the proportions engaged in these broad occupational categories, as evident in Table 3. Thus, white collar occupations involved 54.6 percent of the. employed women, but only 37.3 percent of the employed men. Similarly, larger proportions of women than of men are in the service occupations. On the other hand, blue collar occupations accounted for 46.2 percent of the men, but for only 16.4 percent of the women; a corres-

ponding situation is found in the farm occupations. With advance in age after 20-24 years, the proportion of employed women in white-collar occupations falls off steadily, while the proportions in service occupations and farm occupations rise. For men, advance in age after 20-24 years brings declining proportions in blue-collar occupations, but for whitecollar occupations a level of about 40 percent is maintained from age 25. Both the service and farm occupations take added importance among men after age 25.
These differentials in patterns of economic activity obviously enter into consideration in program planning for occupational health (26). A case in point is provided by the rapid automation of industry, with its increased demand for special skills and its virtual eradication of opportunities for the unskilled. A

study group of the World Health Organization "observed that automation must be considered both as a source of possible improvements in mental health and as a source of new types of strain which will require full consideration and fully planned preventive action" (27). As an example of the favorable impact of automation on physical health, it has been remarked that ". . . closed equipment and control at a distance will reduce tremendously medical problems where they are related to chemicals" (28).
Studies in England and Wales have shown that the higher mortality of the less favored social economic classes is a product of their environment rather than of occupational hazards (29). It seems likely that, with recent health trends, social-economic class variations may have been reduced materially (30).

POPULATION REDISTRIBUTION
AND MIGRATION
The decade from 1950 to 1960, which witnessed a marked growth of population, also saw a great redistribution of population within the country consequent to a movement to the West, a shift from rural areas to urban places and from cities to suburbs, and the migration of nonwhites from the South to the cities of the North (31). During the decade, the West gained a net of 3,850 000 persons by migration, while the South lost 1,404,000 (Table 5). The Northeastern States had a gain of only 336,000, but the North Central States

lost 121,000; each of these regions of the North had a gain of over one half million nonwhites and a loss of whites. The outstanding feature with regard to age is that both Arizona and Florida more than doubled their population of persons 65 and over between 1950 and 1960. Although social and economic considerations are undoubtedly the leading influences in this great internal migration, health is also an element of some importance (32).
As a result of the movement from rural areas, the urban population rose from 64.0 percent of the total in 1950 to 69.9 percent in 1960. In the latter year, Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSA's) contained over three fifths of the total population of the country; these areas are essentially made up of adjacent counties economically and socially oriented to one or more central cities of 50,000 and over (33). These SMSA's increased in population by 26.4 percent between 1950 and 1960, but the central cities within them grew by only 10.8 percent, and most of this was by annexation of adjoining territory. On the other hand, the area within SMSA's but outside the central cities, in which the suburbs are contained, had an increase of 48.5 percent.
The migration of nonwhites to the central cities of SMSA's becomes evident in an increase of 50.6 percent in their number from 1950 to 1960, compared with only 4.7 percent for the whites. In 1960, almost 95 percent of the SMSA population outside the central cities was white. The shift from city to suburb has been largely by the more affluent families, while the migrants to the cities are in poorer circumstances for the most part.
The sprawl of population outside the cities and the changed character of the

Demographic Spectrum

population within them has given rise to new health problems in both areas (34). Rapidly growing communities find they must develop or expand facilities while the older central cities face the task of modernization. These problems relate to hospitals and their associated services, the private practice of medicine, and the functioning of voluntary health associations and like community organizations (35). Also affected importantly are the programs of local health departments and community plans for health services, including environmental and industrial health. Rapid shifts of population have made these problems acute because the issues must be faced by complex structures of local government, and frequently in the presence of competing needs (36).
In addition to these problems arising from the movement of population seeking new permanent residence, there is the health problem of migratory workers, who are largely young persons of limited education, and include a relatively high proportion of nonwhites (37). These health problems are important to the migrants themselves, to their employers, and to the communities through which they travel and in which they live temporarily. The problems arise not only in the provision of health services, but in gaining acceptance by the migrant workers and their families. It has been generalized that "In many areas, the usual living and working conditions of seasonal farmworker families contribute to disease and disability" (38). Furthermore, "There can be no assurance that a service started in one location will be completed in another, even when a migrant follows instructions." Meeting these health problems is the responsibility of local, State, and Federal government, the employers of migratory work-

ers, and also the workers themselves.
THE OLDER AGES
The population at the older ages--65 years and over--has already been described as one with rapid growth in numbers and with an increasing predominance of women, about two-thirds of them unmarried and a sizable proportion not living with relatives. These characteristics become more pronounced with advance in age toward the terminal years. Thus, between 1950 and 1960, the population at ages 85 and over increased by 61 percent, compared with a 25 percent rise at ages 65-69 years. In 1960, the sex ratio was as high as 115 females per 100 males at ages 65-74 years, and 133 females per 100 males at ages 75 and over. The proportion unmarried among older women, according to data for 1961, rose from 53.4 percent at ages 65-74 years to 78.5 percent at ages 75 and over; a corresponding situation is found for males at the older ages, although the proportions unmarried are much smaller.
With advance in years at the older ages, the proportions remaining in the labor force fall off rapidly; among those still in employment, the proportions decline for wage or salary workers, but rise for the self-employed and private household workers. Although much is heard of the movement of older persons to milder climates after retirement, on the whole the migration rates of those 65 and over are smaller than those for younger persons. Increasingly poor health with advance in age is a factor in the declines in labor force participation and also the lesser rates of migration.
Aging, in all of its aspects from the biological to the social, has become a matter of national concern in the postwar period. The biological area--con-

172 Spiegelman

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:27 08 December 2015

sidered in a broad sense--encompasses studies in the physiology, biochemistry, and structural changes of aging (39). A separate topic is the psychology of aging. The social aspects of the aged under study include their demography, their housing, their income maintenance (with due consideration to employment and retirement), and their health maintenance. On each of these topics, the literature continues to accumulate rapidly and is already vast (40). Underlying this literature, either explicitly or implicitly, is the common theme of health.
Many demographic features related to the health problems of the aged require elucidation. Thus, it may be asked to what extent medical care needs are complicated by social needs. For example, it has been noted that the hospital admission rates and stays of the unmarried exceed those of the married (41). Inquiry in this area may be extended to take into account the family status and living arrangements of the aged. This brings up another area in the demography of the aged about which very little is known, namely, the extended family (42). This concept relates to those relatives of the aged living nearby, some even next door, but in another household, who may be available in time of need. So far, census data show nothing on this matter, although the monthly population survey by the Bureau of the Census furnishes a convenient vehicle for its collection.
Further study is needed on health as an influence toward retirement, and also on the effect retirement may have upon health (43). In commenting on the relatively high mortality rates observed in some pension plans soon after retirement, Myers inferred that the effect was produced by a tendency for those in an unhealthy state to retire as soon as per-

mitted. Thompson and Streib stated that "people in poor health tend to retire, and not that retirement affects health. It should be noted, of course, that our data does not necessarily refute the notion that a radical withdrawal from sustaining activities results in a decline of health." A point may be made as to what, if any, stresses are raised by retirement and how they manifest themselves.
Another pertinent question is whether or not the population is accumulating an increasing proportion of physically or mentally impaired lives at the older ages. On the one hand, the control of infections may be reducing the proportion of lives that would otherwise reach the older ages with organic impairments as sequelae. On the other hand, medical advances have prolonged the lifetime of many with physical impairments and thus brought them into the older ages; diabetics are a prime example. In fact, scientific advances and the consequent increased opportunities for "medicated" survival have added to the complexities of medical care at the extreme ages (44).
An insight is needed into the changing social, economic, health, and medical care patterns in a sample of persons in their late productive years traced to their terminal ages. Inferences from such a life history may differ in many respects from those currently based upon comparisons of contemporaries at different ages. For example, the relatively poor economic status of those now aged 75 and over reflects a productive lifetime of low earnings by present standards, the experience of the depression of the 1930's, little opportunity to save, erosion of savings by inflation, small proportions in receipt of Old-Age and Survivors Insurance benefits, and rather low benefits. On the other hand, when those now in

Demographic Spectrum

late productive life reach these advanced ages, they will have the advantage of savings by home ownership, life insurance and otherwise, many will have an income from private pensions, and all but a small fraction will be in receipt of OASI benefits of sizable amounts.
CONCLUSION
The boundaries of demography are hard to define (45). Because of space limitations, the present discussion does not refer to such topics as wealth and religious affiliation, nor has it said anything on health attitudes in relation to demographic structure (46). For many segments of the population, there are important gaps in the information on such matters as health expectations, self-appraisal of health status, attitudes toward health maintenance, and attitudes toward financing and utilization of health services. Whatever the health attribute under consideration may be, it should be recognized at all times that the demographic structure of the country is dynamic, and that plans and programs are more properly guided by trends than by the current situation.
