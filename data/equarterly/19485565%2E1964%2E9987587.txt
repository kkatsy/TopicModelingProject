INTRODUCTION
The occupation and the level of income earned by each member of a capitalistic society indicate to some degree the amount of his natural ability. Those persons who have high ability will usually be engaged in more demanding occupations and will in general receive higher incomes than those with less ability. For the analysis of genetic trends within human populations, therefore, class of occupation and level of income often are used as measures of inherited ability.
Consideration of the fertility of women in relation to their occupation or their income is impractical. The majority of married women are housewives, and the family income is derived mostly from the earnings of their husbands. This study, therefore, will be limited to the occupations and the earnings of the males only.
Some past studies of the relation of fertility to income have included family income from every source. Receipts from investments and the earnings of the wife and children have thus sometimes been included. That part of the family income which best measures personal ability, however, will be the in-

come earned by each individual. In this report, consequently, we shall consider only earned income.
This report will describe the relation of number of children to class of occupation and to level of earned income in the male population of Ann Arbor, Michigan, as exhibited by a random sample taken in 1951-54. Comparison also will be made between the level of income and the amount of education of the males. The eugenic significance of the relations of fertility to class of occupation and to amount of earned income in the Ann Arbor population will then be considered.
THE SAMPLE
The persons whose attributes are described in this report were selected from the adult, resident population of Ann Arbor, Michigan, by a two-stage method of sampling, each stage being random (Dice, Clark, and Gilbert, 1964). The field study was conducted during the years 1951-54. The part of the sample here considered consists of 545 males aged 18 years and older. Of these, 367 were currently married and living with their spouses, 119 had never married, and 59 were widowed, separated, or divorced. Nine of the males were classed as Negroes, 24 as Mongolians, and 2 as white XIndian.
Each person drawn in the sample was asked to come to the Institute of Human

Biology for a set of anthropometric measurements and to fill out a "long-form" questionnaire. For those who for any reason failed to come to the Institute, a "short-form" questionnaire was filled out. Both questionnaires gathered information about number of children, amount of earned income, and occupation; but the information was less detailed for the short-form than for the long-form questionnaire.
Information is complete for the age, marital status, and occupational status of each of the 545 males included in the sample. The number of children is unknown, however, for 3 married males. The occupation is unknown for 1 single and 1 married male. The level of earned income is unknown for 9 single and 20 married males who were employed full time. Information about level of income, nevertheless, is complete for 93.1% of these males. Further, after a careful search, no evidence was found for a concentration of the "missing" males in any level of education or class of occupation such that their omission might seriously affect the randomness of the remaining sample in respect to level of income.
METHOD
In the second and final stage of sampling, one-fourth of the married males, but one-half the single (currently unmarried) males, in each selected sampling unit were drawn at random to constitute the sample. In order to compensate for the over-representation of single males in the sample, their number in any given category may be divided by 2 and the quotient added to the number of married males to produce an adjusted sample of males. Such an adjusted sample has been used for the calculation of means, ratios, proportions, and coeffi-

cients. For computing chi-square or analysis of variance, however, the unadjusted sample has been used.
The age classes used in this study include those males aged 18-24, 25-30, 3040, 40-50, 50-60, 60-70, and 70 years and older (70+ ), respectively. The overlap in ages at each end of the intermediate age classes is due to a difference between the long-form and short-form samples in the age codings employed. This overlap, however, should produce no serious bias in the statistical treatments.
Fertility, as the term is used in this report, refers to the number of children reported to have been produced by an individual or group of individuals. Record was made only of the number of children who lived 24 hours or longer and no account was taken of still-births, miscarriages, or abortions.
EMPLOYMENT STATUS
Employment was at a high level in Ann Arbor during the years 1951-54. Of the 300.5 males in the adjusted sample aged 30 to 70 years, for example, 88% were employed full time and 3% part time, 5% were students, and 3% were retired. Only 1.3% were classed as unemployed.
A somewhat smaller proportion of the never-married than of the previously married or currently married males were employed full time. Of the males in the adjusted sample aged 30 to 70 years, only 75% of those never married, but 92% of those previously married and 89% of those currently married were employed full time.
OCCUPATION
Our classification of occupations follows in general that of Edwards (1940). The population of Ann Arbor, however,

is entirely urban; there is consequently no class of farmers and farm managers nor one of farm laborers and farm foremen. Also, we have combined service workers of all kinds, including domestic service, protective service, and other types of service into a single class of service workers (Table 1). Further, because of the small number of unskilled laborers in the sample, we have in some comparisons combined service workers and laborers into a single occupational class.
The ranking of occupations by Edwards, with professional workers at the top and unskilled laborers at the bottom, gives only a rough indication of the relative amount of inherited ability in each of the occupational classes. It cannot be assumed, for example, that the position of any particular occupation in the classification indicates that the workers in that occupation are superior in all their abilities to the workers who occupy a lower rank.
Professional and semiprofessional workers constitute a considerable proportion of the sample. The presence in Ann Arbor of the University of Michigan and of other intellectual institutions contributes to this abundance of professional workers. Twenty-six per cent of the fully employed males in the adjusted

sample aged between 30 and 70 years were professional or semiprofessional workers, 8.5% were service workers, and only 1.5% were unskilled laborers (Table 1). In the older age classes the proportion of professional workers is somewhat smaller and that of service workers and laborers somewhat larger than in the younger age classes.
FERTILITY AND OCCUPATION
No consistent or statistically significant relation between mean number of children and class or rank of occupation can be detected among those age classes in the sample in which the families of the males can be assumed to be approaching completion (Table 2). Our sample thus fails to demonstrate an appreciable relationship between fertility and class of occupation in the male population of Ann Arbor during the years 1951-54.
INCOME
No fully employed male included in the sample was earning less than $1,000 per year. Incomes of between $1,000 and $3,999 per year were earned by approximately half the males in the adjusted sample who were aged between

18 and 30 years and who were working full time (Table 3). The proportion of males with such low incomes reaches a minimum of 14% in the 40-50 age class and rises again at ages older than 50 years, reaching 47% in the 60-70 age class.
Incomes of $6,000 or more per year were earned by 50% of the working males who were aged 40-50 years, by approximately one-third of those aged 30-40 and 50-60 years, and by about one-fourth of those aged 60-70 years.
Incomes of $10,000 or more per year were earned by 18% of those males in the 40-50 age class of the adjusted sample who were employed full time (Table 3). In the age classes above 50 years the proportion of males with incomes of

$10,000 or more ranges from 14 to 17 percent. A few of these males were earning more than $25,000 per year.
The mean yearly income of the fully employed males in the adjusted sample, as estimated from the medians of the income classes recorded on the questionnaires, reaches a maximum of $7,538 per person for those in the 40-50 age class. The mean incomes of the males in the 50-60 age class ($7,167) and those in the 70+ age class ($7,115) are fairly close to the mean for the 40-50 class. Further, the mean incomes for the 30-40 class ($6,248) and for the 60-70 class ($6,282) are not far below those of these other age classes. Only in the 25-30 age class ($4,094) and 18-24 age class ($3,589) are the yearly earnings of the Ann Arbor males moderately low.

INCOME AND EDUCATION
A positive relation between income and amount of education is well known to occur in the United States. Such a relationship is clearly demonstrated by our sample of the Ann Arbor population. Of the males in the adjusted sample who were employed full time and who were aged 40 years and older, for example, 59% of those earning $10,000 or more per year had graduated from college, while only 7% of those in this income group had received no education beyond junior high school (9th grade). Conversely, of those males in the 40+ age group who were earning less than |4,000 per year, only 5% had graduated from college, while 79% had received only a junior-high-school education or less.
In order to secure a measure of the relation between income and education in the Ann Arbor male population, we have calculated the correlation coefficients between yearly earned income and years of education for those males in the adjusted sample who were employed full time and whose income levels were known. For computing incomes we have used the approximate median for each of the income classes recorded on the questionnaires. For computing years of education we have used the approximate

median of each educational class following the method described by Dice, Clark, and Gilbert (1964).
The coefficient of correlation between yearly earned income and years of education is +.31 for the 18-30 age class of the males, +.29 for the 30-40 class, +.47 for the 40-50 class, +.51 for the 50-60 class, and +.28 for the 60-70 class. All of these correlation coefficients, except that for the 60-70 age class, are significant at the 5% level, and some of them are significant at the 1% level.
MARITAL STATUS AND INCOME
Fifteen percent of the males in the adjusted sample aged 40 to 70 years who were earning under $4,000 per year had never married. Seventeen percent had previously been married but were currently divorced, separated, or widowed (Table 4). Thus, only 68% of the males aged 40 to 70 years who were earning less than $4,000 per year were currently married and living with their spouses.
In contrast, only 1.2% of the males in the 40-70 age group of the adjusted sample who were earning $4,000 or more per year had never married, and less than 5% had previously been married but were now divorced, separated, or widowed (Table 4). Ninety-four percent of the males in the adjusted sample aged

40 to 70 years who were in the income classes above $4,000 thus were currently married. Only a small amount of variation in the proportion currently married occurs among the $4,000-$5,999, $6,000$9,999, and $10,000+ income classes.
Low income is evidently negatively associated with both the likelihood of marriage and the permanence of the marriage relation among the males in the Ann Arbor population.
MARITAL STATUS, INCOME, AND FERTILITY
Since marital status is highly correlated with level of income in the Ann Arbor male population, it is to be expected that there will be a greater difference in mean number of children between the married-only and the marriedplus-single males for the low income than for the high income groups. This expectation is confirmed by our sample. The married males aged 40 to 70 years who had incomes of $l,000-$3,999 per year have a mean of 2.31 children, while all the males of this age group, including single as well as married, have a mean of only 1.94 children. In the upper income levels, on the contrary, the difference in fertility between the married males and the married-plus-single males is small. For all those with incomes of $4,000 or more, for example, the mean number of children is 2.03 for the married-only and 1.95 for the married-plus-single males. Only small variations occur among the several income levels above $4,000 in the relative fertility of the marital status classes.
We conclude that comparisons of the fertility of those earning low incomes with the fertility of those earning high incomes would be in considerable error if based on the number of children of the currently married persons only.

FERTILITY AND INCOME
For the analysis of the relation between number of children and amount of income we shall consider only those males who at the time of the field study were employed full time. We shall also restrict our attention to the ages between 30 and 70 years.
The males in the older age classes of the sample have usually a larger mean number of children than those in the younger classes (Table 5). Part of this progressive increase in number of children with the age of the father undoubtedly is due to the families of the younger males not being fully complete. The smaller families of the younger than of .the older males, however, may in part be the result of a general decrease in family size in the decades before 1950.
While there is thus a general progressive increase with age in the mean number of children of the males included in the sample, this increase is not regular in any of the income classes. Nor are the variations of family size with age synchronous among the several income classes. Some of these irregularities are obviously random variations due to the small numbers in many of the categories. Some of the irregularities, however, may

be due to fluctuations in economic conditions or to changes in other socioeconomic factors which may have affected the fertility of the several age and income groups in different ways or to different degrees. Grouping of the 10-year age classes into larger units to obtain greater numbers for statistical treatments might consequently lead to erroneous deductions.
The most fertile income class in the Ann Arbor population in 1951-54 was comprised of those males who were earning $10,000 or more per year. In the 30-40, 40-50, and 50-60 age classes the means of the number of children for those fully employed males who were earning $10,000 or more per year are consistently greater than the means for those with smaller incomes (Table 5). In the 60-70 age class, the males with incomes of $10,000 or more have a somewhat smaller mean number of children than those with smaller incomes, but the number of males in this age and income class is too few for critical comparison.
The differences in mean number of children between the $10,000+ income class and the lower income classes are fairly large in most of the age classes. Only for the 50-60 age class, however, is the difference in number of children between the $10,000+ and the $6,000$9,999 income classes significant at the 5% level (.05>P>.025). Nevertheless, the consistency with which the means for the number of children of the $10,000+ income class exceeds in most of the age classes the means for the lower income classes indicates strongly that in 1951-54 those males in the Ann Arbor population who were earning incomes of $10,000 or more per year were in general more fertile than those with smaller incomes.

Those males who were earning between $6,000 and $9,999 per year, however, were not more fertile than those with smaller incomes. On the contrary, in the 50-60 and 60-70 age classes the $6,000-$9,999 income class has smaller mean numbers of children than either the $l,000-$3,999 or ?4,000-$5,999 classes (Table 5). In all the age classes the differences in number of children between the $6,000-$9,999 income class and each of the classes with smaller incomes are nonsignificant at the 5% level. It is evident, therefore, that the $6,000-$9,999 income class does not follow the pattern of the §10,000+ class in being more fertile than the lower income classes.
The $4,000-$5,999 income class has larger mean numbers of children than the $l,000-$3,999 c j a s s j n t h e 3O_4o, 50-
60, and 60-70 age classes, but a smaller mean in the 40-50 class. At ages older than 40 years, however, the differences in means between these income classes are small. In all the age classes the differences between these two income classes in number of children are nonsignificant at the 5% level. The $l,000-?3,999 and $4,000-$5,999 income classes thus appear not to differ significantly in their fertility.
The coefficient of correlation between number of children and amount of yearly earned income of the males in the adjusted sample who were aged 30-40 years is +.05, but this coefficient is nonsignificant at the 5% level (P>.10). The 40-50 age class has a coefficient of +.25, which is significant at the 5% level (.05> P>.02). The coefficient for the 50-60 age class is +.20, but this is nonsignificant at the 5% level (P>.10). The 6070 age class has the negative coefficient of -- .04, but this also is nonsignificant.
The consistently positive coefficients of

correlation between number of children and amount of earned income exhibited by the 30-40, 40-50, and 50-60 age classes of the males in the sample suggests that there may have been in 195154 an overall positive relation between fertility and level of income among the males aged 30 to 60 years in the population of Ann Arbor. The small size of the positive coefficient in the 30-40 age class probably results from many of the males in the lower income classes beginning their families at a younger age than those who have spent many years in obtaining an advanced education. The small negative coefficient exhibited by the 60-70 age class might be taken to indicate a dysgenic relation between fertility and income in past decades, but the absence of significance for this correlation makes such an interpretation uncertain.
Our sample of the population of Ann Arbor thus indicates that in 1951-54 the mean number of children for those males who were aged between 40 and 60 years and who were earning $10,000 or more per year was greater than the means for those who were earning less than $10,000. No significant relation between fertility and level of income appears to occur among the $l,000-$3,999, $4,000-$5,999, and $6,000-$9»999 income classes. The evidence strongly indicates that the $6,000-$9,999 income class is at least not more fertile than either of the two lower income classes.
DISCUSSION
No evidence for either a dysgenic or eugenic trend in respect to inherited ability in the population of Ann Arbor is given by the relation in the sample between fertility and class of occupation. The absence of a significant relation between these attributes may in part be

due to the small number of persons included in some of the occupational classes. Only 4.0 laborers and 26.5 service workers, for example, aged between 30 and 70 years were included in the adjusted sample. The numbers of persons who represent some of the occupational classes are consequently too few in many of the age classes to provide a satisfactory basis for statistical comparisons. Nevertheless, if a large difference in fertility between any of the occupational classes in the population had existed, it should have been indicated by the sample.
An inverse relation between number of children and amount of family income was reported by most of the early studies of this relationship. Based on information gathered in 1935-36 in many cities of the United States, for example, such an inverse relation was reported (Kiser, 1942). Likewise, in the United States as whole in 1949 the number of children less than 5 years old of wives between 15 and 49 years of age was inversely related to family income (Kiser, 1952).
Some recent studies report that at least in certain populations those families which have the highest incomes have more children on the average than those with intermediate incomes. Information gathered in the 1950 census, for example, indicates that married women aged 45 years and older exhibited in general an inverse relation between their fertility and their family income. Among the younger married women, aged 15-44 years, on the contrary, the birth rate was higher for those with family incomes of $5,000 and over per year than for those with intermediate incomes. Those families with incomes of less than $1,000 per year, however, were the most fertile income class of all, both for the urban

and rural nonfarm population and for the United States as a whole (Grabill, Kiser, and Whelpton, 1958). A change in the relation between fertility and income consequently may be in progress in the United States and perhaps in other countries (Wrong, 1958).
Unfortunately, most of the past estimates of the relation between fertility and income have been based on samples of the currently married persons only or, more rarely, on samples of the evermarried persons. The omission of the never-married persons from consideration must have produced considerable errors in the estimates. Earlier in this report we have pointed out that, at least in Ann Arbor, a larger proportion of never-married and of divorced, separated, and widowed persons occur in the lower than in the upper income levels. The fertility differential in relation to level of income reported by many previous studies, therefore, has probably been exaggerated. We actually do not know what the relation between fertility and income in the United States has been in the past or is at present when the single as well as the married persons in the population are considered.
Family size in Ann Arbor can be assumed to conform fairly well to the number of children desired by each pair of parents. Family planning is practiced by most inhabitants of the United States. Considerate parents limit the number of their children to those they can rear and educate on the amount of income currently available or anticipated during the period their children will be dependent upon them. A larger proportion of those families in the United States in which the husbands earn $7,000 or more per year, however, plan the number and spacing of their children than of those families which have the lowest incomes

(Freedman, Whelpton, and Campbell, 1959).
The greater mean number of children of those Ann Arbor males who were earning $10,000 or more per year than of those with smaller incomes is probably due in considerable part to their financial resources being sufficiently large to support and educate several children without undue financial strain (Stern, 1960). The cost of rearing and educating a child, however, is not the same in all families, but varies with the services and education each child receives. The cost per child for food, clothing, housing, books, medical and dental services, recreation, travel, and other expenses may be much greater for a family in an upper or middle socioeconomic class than for one in a lower class. The cost of education in particular is much greater for those children who are sent to college or perhaps also to graduate school than for those whose education stops on or before the completion of high school. Those parents with limited incomes who are striving to give their children the best possible home advantages and education will consequently plan usually to have smaller families than those who are less ambitious for their children.
The absence of an appreciable difference in fertility between those Ann Arbor males earning $6,000-$9,999 and those earning less than $6,000 per year indicates that the members of both these income groups were restricting the sizes of their families to about the same degree. It is probable, however, that they were doing so for somewhat different reasons. Those with the lowest incomes were perhaps limiting the size of their families in considerable part because they could not provide food and other essentials to a large number of children. Although those parents who had in-

comes of $6,000 to $9,999 per year could provide the necessities of life to more children than could those with very small incomes, they would in general probably be more ambitious for their children, especially in respect to education.
Most of the males in the $6,000-$9,999 income class were well educated. Of those in this income class aged 40 years and older, 49% had graduated from college and some had taken graduate work. It may consequently be assumed that a large proportion of the families in the $6,000-$9,999 income class would plan to give their children at least a college education. The smaller average number of children of those males who had incomes of between $6,000 and $9,999 than of those with incomes of $10,000 or more probably represents in part, therefore, a restriction in family size in order to provide a good education and other advantages to the few children they could afford to support adequately.
Should there be differential mortality among the children of fathers with different amounts of income, this might affect the relative contributions of the several income classes to the heredity of the following generation. Unhealthy living conditions, deficiency of proper food, lack of medical care, or insufficient parental care may result in heavier mortality among the children of parents with very low incomes than among the children of parents who are financially able to provide more adequate support (Woodbury, 1925). The rate of infant mortality in most cities of the United States, however, has been very low during recent decades. Differential mortality related to parental income may consequently be assumed to be of only slight importance in the population of Ann Arbor.

Males who spend many years in school and college usually begin their families at a somewhat older age than those whose education is terminated when they are younger. Because level of income and amount of education are correlated, as described above, it is to be expected that those males who ultimately reach the higher income levels will on the average produce their families at an older age than those who remain in the lower income classes. Fewer generations per century may consequently be produced by those males in the higher than by those in the lower income classes. In this report, however, we have not attempted to assess the eugenic significance of variation in generation length, but have considered only the possible effects of variation in fertility in relation to occupation and to level of income on the heredity of the immediately following generation.
Level of income is undoubtedly related positively to hereditary ability. Men of great ability can be expected to receive on the average higher incomes than men of low ability. Ability includes not only intelligence and special aptitudes, but also those features of temperament which may affect the socioeconomic position of the individual. Such traits of personality as industriousness, imagination, cooperation with others, and dependability, for example, are here included in the concept of ability (Cattell, 1957; Dice, 1960). Most or perhaps all of these mental traits are to some degree inherited (Cattell, 1950; Strandskov, 1955; Vandenberg, 1962).
Education and experience, of course, also affect level of income. So do numerous features of personality which may be acquired or modified during the lifetime of each individual. Heredity, however, undoubtedly controls to some degree the extent to which each individual is able

to profit by education and to acquire those traits of personality which may affect his earnings.
The educational achievements of the males in the sample support the conclusion that those with incomes of $6,000 and over per year possessed greater abilities on the average than those with smaller incomes. Fifty-nine percent of the males in the adjusted sample aged 40 years and older who had incomes of $10,000 or more per year and 49% of those with incomes of $6,000-$9,999 were college graduates. In contrast, only 12% of the males in this age group who had incomes of $4,000-$5,999 and 2% of those with incomes of $l,000-$3,999 had graduated from college. Insofar as ability is measured by the level of education achieved, therefore, those Ann Arbor males aged 40 years and older who were earning $6,000 or more per year were more able on the average than those with smaller incomes. Level of income, however, would not be expected to be so reliable an indicator of ability for the males younger than 40 years, many of whom would not yet have reached a level of income representative of their capabilities.
Those males in the population of Ann Arbor who were earning $10,000 or more per year appear to have been more fertile than those who had incomes of less than $10,000. Thus, those males in the adjusted sample aged between 50 and 60 years whose incomes were $10,000 or more had on the average produced 1.9 times the number of children of those with incomes of $6,000-$9,999, 1.3 times as many as those with incomes of $4,000$5,999, and 1.4 times as many as those with incomes of $l,000-$3,999. Likewise, in the 40-50 age class those males who were earning $10,000 or more per year had produced larger mean numbers

of children than the males in each of the smaller income classes (Table 5). Inasmuch as 17% of the males in the adjusted sample who were aged 50-60 years and 18% of those aged 40-50 years were earning $10,000 or more per year (Table 3), an appreciable proportion of the male population aged between 40 and 60 years exhibited a positive relation between fertility and level of income.
The positive relationship between fertility and level of income in the Ann Arbor population, however, is limited to those males who were earning $10,000 or more per year compared to those who were earning less than $10,000. The males in the $6,000-$9,999 income class, on the contrary, have smaller mean numbers of children in most age classes than the males in one or other or both the $4,000-$5,999 and $l,000-$3,999 income classes, although in no comparison is the difference in means significant at the 5% level. The $6,000-$9,999 income class thus appears clearly not to be more fertile than either of the two lower income classes.
Insofar as level of income measures inherited ability, the greater fertility of those males who were earning $10,000 or more per year than of those with smaller income suggests than an eugenic trend toward an increase in ability may have been in progress in the population of Ann Arbor during the years 1951-54, when our sample was collected. The occurrence in the Ann Arbor population of any general eugenic trend of inherited ability, however, is contradicted by the mediocre fertility of the members of the $6,000-$9,999 income class, many of whom had achieved high levels of education and must consequently have possessed considerable ability.
The eugenic trend toward improvement in inherited ability which is sug-

gested to have been in progress in Ann Arbor was limited, therefore, to only a part of the population. The overall effect of this eugenic trend on the population as a whole would consequently be expected at best to be small.
The actual relations of level of income to intelligence and to those traits of personality that may be subsumed under the heading "ability" unfortunately are little known, and no adequate measures of these relationships have as yet been devised. In particular, it has not been demonstrated that those traits of intelligence or of personality that may contribute to the earning of a large income are all of benefit to society in other socioeconomic relations.
From the evidence presented above and on the basis of our current knowledge of the relations between income and ability, we can conclude only that, due to the superior fertility of those males who were earning §10,000 or more per year, a small eugenic improvement in hereditary ability may possibly have been taking place in 1951-54 in the population of Ann Arbor. No satisfactory methods are available for measuring the amount of improvement in hereditary ability to be expected in the next generation due to this differential fertility, if indeed any overall improvement actually was in progress.
The conclusion reached by this study, suggesting a small positive relation between fertility and income in the population of Ann Arbor, differs from the conclusions reached by most previous studies, which in general have reported a negative relation between fertility and income. One possible reason for part of this difference is that we have included the single as well as the married persons in our sample, while most previous stud-

ies have recorded the fertility only of the currently married persons.
The inclusion of the single as well as the married males in our sample, however, evidently does not account for all the difference between our results and those of most previous investigators. Ninety-three percent of the males in our sample aged between 40 and 70 years who were earning $10,000 or more per year were currently married (Table 4). The omission of the single persons would consequently affect only slightly the means for the number of children of the males in this income class. In the $1,000$3,999 income class the omission of the single males would considerably affect the means for the number of children per person. The $l,000-$3,999, $4,000$5,999, and $6,000-$9,999 income classes in our sample, however, do not differ significantly from one another in their relation between fertility and level of income. The inclusion of the single males in our sample, therefore, can account at most for only a small part of the differences between our conclusions and those of earlier studies.
Another possible reason for at least part of the difference between the conclusions reached in this study and those reported by most earlier studies is that the population of Ann Arbor may differ in its fertility pattern from the populations previously investigated. Every population must be to some degree unique in its fertility relations. The population of Ann Arbor is exceptionally well educated and contains large proportions of highly skilled and professional workers, many of whom earn relatively high incomes. The excellent educational facilities available in the city make the education of children less expensive than in many other communities. These and other factors undoubtedly

166

Dice, et al.

contribute to making the fertility pattern in Ann Arbor different in at least certain respects from the fertility patterns in other cities.
Whatever the reasons may be for the difference between our results and those of most previous studies, the evidence indicates that those males in our sample who were earning $10,000 or more per year had produced a greater mean number of children per person than those with smaller incomes. This positive relation between fertility and level of income suggests that, insofar as level of earned income measures inherited ability, there may possibly have been in 1951-54 a small eugenic trend in the population of Ann Arbor toward an improvement in ability.
SUMMARY
Information about employment status, occupation, yearly earned income, age, marital status, and number of children was obtained from a random sample taken in 1951-54 of the resident population of Ann Arbor, Michigan. The part of the sample here described consists of 545 males aged 18 years or older.
Of the 300.5 males aged 30-70 years included in the sample, as adjusted for over-representation of single males, 88% were employed full time and only 1.3% were unemployed.
Professional and semiprofessional workers comprised 26% of the fully employed males aged 30 to 70 years. Only 8.5% were service workers, and 1.5% were unskilled laborers.
The sample does not provide significant evidence that the workers in any particular class of occupation differ in the number of their children from the workers in any other occupational class.
The mean yearly earned income of those males employed full time reaches a

maximum of $7,538 in the 40-50 age class. Only 14% of the males aged 4050 years were earning less than $4,000 per year, and 18% were earning $10,000 or more.
The coefficients of correlation between amount of yearly earned income and years of education for the fully employed males in the sample are positive in all the age classes and range from +.29 in the 30-40 age class to +.51 in the 50-60 class.
A greater proportion of the males who were earning less than $4,000 per year had never married; and a greater proportion were divorced, separated, or widowed than of those with larger incomes.
An estimate of the relation of fertility to level of income in the Ann Arbor population based on the number of children of the currently married males only would be in considerable error.
The mean number of children produced per adult individual, irrespective of his marital status, was greater for the group of males earning $10,000 or more per year than for the lower income groups.
The income classes $6,000-$9,999, $4,000-$5,999, and $l,000-$3,999 exhibit no significant differences from one another in the number of their children.
Insofar as level of earned income may measure inherited ability, the greater fertility of those males who had incomes of $10,000 or more per year than of those with smaller incomes suggests that possibly a small eugenic increase in hereditary ability may be expected in the next generation of the Ann Arbor population.
