THIS SUBJECT is difficult to discuss, since there is no generally accepted definition of childhood mental illness, and since data in the field of human heredity are accumulating so rapidly that concepts derived from the data are in a state of flux.
A broad definition of childhood mental illness should be extended to all disorders in the development or maturation of the child--his body, including his brain; his mind and personality--which result in inadequate or disturbed relationships to the physical world and with the people, significant and otherwise, in the child's life. Mental illness in childhood usually involves some degree and kind of mental retardation, at least in passing, as well as neurological disturbances, visceral or somatic dysfunctions, learning and adaptive difficulties, and disturbances in behavior, perception, language, symbol formation, ideation, and fantasy. The maturational curve of the mentally ill child is not smooth. It may lag, stagnate, regress, fluctuate erratically, or accelerate, especially at critical growth epochs. There are also to be observed the total gamut of defense mechanisms which may even determine the clinical picture and which are referred to as behavior disorders, conduct disorders, character disorders, emotional disturbances, neuroses, psychoses, etc.

The rapidly increasing knowledge in psychiatric genetics has disrupted many of our hallowed convictions concerning heredity but has given us instead more useful and informative ones. The nature-nurture controversy is being resolved by reemphasizing the intricacies of heredity and environment, each equally dependent upon the other and each equally important in the ongoing pattern of development and behavior (Fuller, 1954; Dunn, 1962).
Thus, it has been shown that, since we now have an explanation for mongolism (Down's syndrome), the disease is found to be neither typically hereditary nor environmental. It arises from a deficit in the mechanism by which the hereditary material is passed on from parent to offspring. It is still not clear "whether the deficit in the genetic mechanism is itself hereditary or environmental" (i.e., the advanced age of the mother (Beam and German, 1961).
Clemens Benda's (1960a, pp. 1, 2) masterful analysis of the pathology and clinical course in mongolism may be looked upon as a prototype of those mental illnesses arising in early development and determined by "misfiring in nuclear fission." Mongolism is a prenatal growth deficiency in which central growth regulation is at fault. The resulting deceleration of growth and differentiation occurs in every cell and is reflected in every organ. Stagnation of unused hormones from endocrine organs leads to further

degenerative processes, secondarily. The fetal arrest is typical of the sixth to twelfth week of intrauterine life, though the anomaly probably occurs at fertilization. A normal anlage for structural organ development is laid down and appears to persist until the second to third month of intrauterine life, but then the chromosomal defect, present from the beginning, expresses itself in a deceleration of growth and of differentiation in every organ with a consequential immaturity in functioning of the organism as a whole.
I have suggested (1962) an analogy (certainly nothing more) between this condition and schizophrenia in early childhood in which organ structure continues in a normal way but basic patterned function retains the primitive plasticity of the embryo in all functional areas, including the capacity to reverse itself. No cellular or chromosomal pathology is determined in schizophrenia, although genetic studies furnish significant data (Kallmann and Roth, 1956).
Closely related to mongolism are the chromosome anomalies in patients with abnormalities of sex differentiation. Indeed, the mongol often has this pathology also. Included are the gonadal dysgeneses, hermaphroditics, who often have other multiple defects, with more or less mental deficiency and emotional problems. As children, especially the milder cases, they are often referred for care for mental illness or emotional disturbance and often are incorrectly diagnosed as schizophrenics. The chromosomal anomaly is described as a nondisjunction during germ cell formation. Similar multiple developmental defects occur as in mongolism. Also stagnation of hormones in the endocrines, even in fetal life, may explain the failure in gonadal development or atrophy later.

This suggests that the gonadal deficiencies and their associated features are secondary (Kallmann, 1961).
Another group of related congenital disorders which suggest hereditary factors are those which involve multiple defects in the ectodermal or cutaneous tissues and the central nervous systems. In this group are the Sturge-Weber syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, which have in common multiple involvements of the skin with hemangiomas or sebaceous cysts, pigmented plaques, and tumors, with similar involvements in the brain leading to calcifications, convulsions, mental retardation with progressive features, deterioration, and death. Like the previously described conditions (mongolism and aberrations in sexual development), they also have other multiple defects and deformities, such as skull shape and size; eye anomalies; mouth deformities, including a high palate and defective dentition; spinal column defects; hand defects; extra-pyramidal and motility disorders; muscular hypotonia; language and speech disorders; mental deficiency; and emotional disorders (Jervis, 1959; Melchior, Benda and Yakovlev, 1960; Polani, 1960).
Quite recently, partial trisomy has been detected in several cases of Sturge-Weber's syndrome (three of 18 examined) by Patau et al. (1961). Their conclusion was that "chromosomal abnormality of some kind . . . . is always present, even though its microscopic demonstration may usually be impossible with the available methods . . . we advance an interpretation in which the Sturge-Weber Syndrome appears as a prototype of a large etiologically unique class of syndromes, individually rare but collectively probably accounting for a substantial part of all multiple congenital anomalies including those with retardation."

So far no chromosomal abnormality has been demonstrated in tuberous sclerosis (Jervis, personal communication), although it and the Klippel-Feil Syndrome would seem to belong to this forecast.
These groups of patients are important in our discussion of mental illness in children. Many of them are referred to the child psychiatrist and to hospitals for mentally ill children, usually incorrectly diagnosed. If they are mute, or especially retarded in language, the referring diagnosis is often autism. Considerable clinical experience is required to recognize the developmental deviate child as distinct from the schizophrenic autistic child. Schizophrenia is also associated with many dysplastic developmental deviations. The functioning level and behavior are not easily distinguishable in these two groups of children in the early years.
Also, many children may have these developmental syndromes and not be grossly mentally defective--or not defective at all. Such children are often referred to clinically as emotional disturbances, and the significance of the developmental anomaly, even when apparent, is often played down. However, it is appropriate to refer such patients for psychiatric guidance. Their problem, once recognized, will make it possible to alleviate emotional stress and guide them in community living in accordance with their capacities and limitations.
Our latest knowledge concerning phenylpyruvic acid oligophrenia is of great importance conceptual-wise to the field of childhood mental illnesses. Knox (1961) has pointed out that this condition cannot properly be called a congenital form of mental deficiency, or be regarded as being determined by heredity only, since the mental deficiency can be prevented if the inborn error in me-

tabolism is diagnosed shortly after birth and a phenyl alanine-free diet is furnished during the critical period, which is before six months through two years of age--or the period of myelinization of the central nervous system.
The same period is further recognized to be the critical time for avoiding emotional-social deprivation in an infant and also represents the crucial stage of development in language and awareness of the self as distinct from the nonself. Gross deprivation during this period may lead to a retardation in mentality and personality almost as severe as phenylpyruvic acid oligophrenia and as irreversible (Bowlby, 1951; Bender, 1960). Consequently, any very early institutionalization in suspected cases of mental deficiency may contribute as much to the final mental defective state by failure in suitable early treatment as inborn metabolic errors or brain defect. Severe psychological trauma or critical changes in a child's life during this period may also disrupt normal personality development.
The most important contribution to the demonstration of a hereditary factor in childhood schizophrenia has been made by Kallmann and Roth (1956). They studied prepuberty schizophrenia in 52 twins and 50 singletons, with 17 of the twin index cases having been monozygotic and 35, dizygotic. The diagnostic criteria were rigid in that all young or autistic children were excluded and only those cases were accepted in which there was a distinct change in the behavior of the child who previously seemed to develop normally. "The most frequently observed symptoms were diminished interest in the environment, blunted or distorted affect, peculiar conduct especially in motor activity, diffuse anxiety with phobias and vague somatic complaints, bizarre thinking with a tend-

ency toward exaggerated fantasies, and hallucinations." The psychosis occurred in the index cases before the age of 15.
In comparing the data from these preadolescent schizophrenic cases with Kallmann's comparable adult sample (691 twin index cases), the investigators found an essential agreement in intergroup differences with respect to the twin concordance rates as well as with respect to the schizophrenia rates of the parents (12.5% and 9.2%) and the sibs (12.2% and 14.3%) of the index cases. Fathers and mothers contributed equally to the parental schizophrenia rate. Two-egg and one-egg co-twins of schizophrenic index cases differed as much in concordance for preadolescent schizophrenia (17.1% and 70.6%) as they did with regard to adult schizophrenia (14.7% and 85.8%). These findings indicate an early effect in childhood schizophrenia of the same genotype assumed to be responsible for the basic symptoms of adult schizophrenia. Psychosis of the co-twins of early schizophrenia cases occurred sometimes before and sometimes after adolescence. There appeared to be an increase in the number of early schizophrenia cases among the co-twins and sibs of early index cases and a definite excess of males over females in preadolescent groups. The authors deemed it justifiable to conclude that both forms of the disease were biologically determined.
Creak and Ini (1960) used the pedigree method in studying 102 families of psychotic children, 60 of them thoroughly. Their findings were inconclusive, but it was noted that this was a heterogenous sample both of psychotic children and of parents. At any rate, the risk of psychoses or mental defects was found to be higher among the sibs of psychotic children than for the general population (England).

Another significant observation was made by David E. Sobel (1961), who studied infants born to schizophrenic women in New York State mental hospitals. Between 1950 and 1958, 218 schizophrenic women gave birth to 222 children (including four sets of twins). The perinatal mortality rate was 8.1% as compared to 3.6% in the general population. The incidence of developmental defects or malformations was 3.2% as opposed to 0.8% in the general population. It was suggested that such malformations might be expressive of a metabolic, biochemical, or hormonal defect in the parent, the existence of which had also been of causal significance in producing schizophrenia in the parent.
Data concerning the familial incidence of schizophrenia in children diagnosed childhood schizophrenia, accumulated from the Children's Service of Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital between 1934 and 1956 and from the Creedmoor State Hospital Children's Unit since 1956, yielded the following results.
In 1950, a follow-up study1 of 143 schizophrenic children who had received shock treatment from 1938-1942 was made (Table 1). Family histories indicated that 57 of them (40%) were known to have a parent with a recorded or suggested diagnosis of schizophrenia; 15 (10%) had both parents so recorded; and 11 had siblings under treatment for schizophrenia (Bender, 1953).
In 1953, a study was made (Table 2) covering 90 children under seven years of age, diagnosed schizophrenic on Bellevue children's ward between 1935 and 1951 (Bender, 1955). A total of 44 parents were mentally ill. Seven fathers, 13 mothers, and 14 siblings were schizophrenic.

Bender and Grugett (1956) reported family data on 30 young schizophrenic children under the age of seven, selected at random from 142 observed on the children's wards of Bellevue from 1934 through 1951 and compared with 30 matched nonschizophrenic children observed at the same time (Table 3). Twelve children had fathers who had either been clinically diagnosed as schizophrenic or whose social adjustment was such as to call out a label of "ambulatory schizophrenia." In five of these cases only the father was so considered; but in seven, the father plus one or two other close relatives were considered schizophrenic. Fourteen children had mothers who were known to be schizophrenic. In this group, nine children had another relative who had been hospitalized or treated for mental illness of varying diagnoses. In four of them, the other relative was the father. Altogether, 22 had at least one sick parent or sibling, while seven children had only collaterals who were known to be sick. In 11 cases, both maternal and paternal lines had records with deep psychopathology. Ascertainment in this report was minimal.
Between 1935 and 1957, about 450 children were transferred from the Bellevue children's psychiatric ward to Letchworth Village, a New York State institution for the retarded. Between December 1956 and March 1959, in monthly visits to Letchworth Village, 100 of these patients were re-examined by us (personally 69, or by record). This group included 65 boys and 35 girls. Familial concentration was conspicuous. One-fourth of the children, or 25, were from eleven families of two and three siblings. Nine other children had another disturbed sibling at Bellevue, and five other children had a record of a disturbed sibling. Hence, 38 of the 100 children had a

known defective or disturbed sibling. According to the family histories, 22 of the children had a known mentally ill or criminal parent. Of the five sets of twins in this group, only one pair was represented by both members at Letchworth Village. Three of the others were of opposite sex and represented by boys, whose twin sisters had remained at home. Once again, these figures are minimum estimates.
In 1961 (Bender), a study was made of 51 case histories of children known over 25 years at Bellevue City Hospital and

New York State facilities. These children had been diagnosed "schizophrenic" before puberty, although they also showed some form of convulsive disorder. They were classified in five groups:
1. Ten children who were autistic, nonverbal, had been treated by many methods in widely different facilities without responding. Severe grand mal convulsions developed and could not be controlled. No child had a definite family history of institutionalized schizophrenic relatives, although one parent and some collateral relatives received therapy for what was called ambulatory schizophrenia.
2. Eight children with some initial normal development were disturbed in childhood and revealed evidence of motor and impulsive disorders. They tended to progress in puberty, with deteriorating intelligence and increased impulsivity, myoclonus and temporal lobe disorders. There was no family history of schizophrenia or other condition.
3. Thirteen children, disturbed in childhood with dramatic psychotic features, developed grand mal convulsions with diagnostic EEG's. All responded to anticonvulsant drugs. Family histories revealed neglectful, abusive parents, but no schizophrenia.
4. Nine children demonstrated typical clinical symptoms of epilepsy and schizophrenia. There were strong schizophrenic family histories in six and history of definite brain damage in several.
5. Thirteen children were typically schizophrenic with isolated episodes of atypical convulsions. In eight, there were family histories with close members having known schizophrenic psychoses.
Thus, in these 51 children who were diagnosed schizophrenia but also developed convulsions, 31 appeared subse-

quently to be suffering from some organic condition rather than schizophrenia. Family history of schizophrenia was lacking or weak in these cases. In the remaining 20, schizophrenia and epilepsy occurred together or there were atypical convulsive episodes in the course of the schizophrenic process. Fourteen of these 20 had close relatives with schizophrenia.
This catamnestic, longitudinal study reveals that the diagnostic aspects of childhood disorders with schizophrenialike and convulsive features become clarified with time and a careful analysis of family histories.
Heredity in convulsive disorders in children (epilepsy) has been investigated as extensively as that in schizophrenia. Similar problems exist in determining a core or specific diagnostic type. The age of onset appears to be another important variable. According to W. G. Lennox (1951), the incidence of epilepsy in the relatives of probands with asymptomatic epilepsy was found to be 7.2 times as high as the incidence in U.S. World War I and II draftees. In another study of children, C. Oumstead (1955) investigated the siblings of 1,000 English children with any kind of seizure or fit. The observed morbidity rate was reported to be 14% to 28% of convulsive disorders in two-thirds of the group.
In a recent review of the subject by J. D. Metrakos (1961), mention was made of an investigation by a group of Montreal researchers who had explored the question of "heredity as an etiological factor in convulsive disorders." Among other data, the analysis included the twin studies of Conrad (1940), Rosanofi et al. (1934), Lennox and Jolly (1954), and their own--altogether a series of 350 pairs of twins. Among the monozygotic twins, 60% were concordant, while in the dizygotic group, only 10% were concord-

ant. Matrakos' study of families of 68 affected child probands as compared to the families of 132 unaffected children showed an incidence of around 1.5% of all classes of relatives of the unaffected children, while approximately 10% of the parents and siblings of the convulsive probands were affected and 1.5% of the grandparents and cousins.
According to EEG studies, 35% of examined siblings of "centrencephalic" (idiopathic) probands showed significant EEG disturbances, while in control sibships no such pathology was found. In Metrakos' opinion, these findings were of particular significance since they delineated a specific form of epilepsy which can be identified electroencephalographically in over one-third of the siblings. A similar incidence of EEG dysrhythmias was found in the families of epileptics by Lennox and Jolly (1954). Familial patterns in the EEG records of all types of behavior disorder in children were reported by Kennard (1949).
Genetic factors have long been assumed to play a role in allergic states and many psychosomatic disorders; i.e., asthma, diabetes, celiac disorders, dysautonomia (Freedman et al., 1957), etc. These conditions are common features in schizophrenic and other mentally ill children. A separate review would be necessary to particularize the hereditary factors in these syndromes.
Another area involving concepts of congenital, familial, and hereditary influences on development is the one comprizing disturbances in language development, including congenital aphasia and developmental dyslexia or, more generally speaking, the learning difficulties. Some problems of this kind are seen in many children who are not and should not be considered mentally ill. Moreover, severe handicaps such as congenital apha-

sia are not readily distinguishable from autism, for example. Many children are classified as mentally ill because a combination of factors makes it impossible for them to function under the circumstances in which they are placed. Consequently, it will be found in any hospital facility, such as school or clinic, for problem children that learning retardation, especially in the area of language with more or less specific reading disabilities, presents major diagnostic and remedial difficulties that must be dealt with if the children are to be expected to develop adequately.
A specific etiology in many cases of dyslexia, aphasia, and language retardation or lags has been postulated in terms of a deviant maturity of cerebral dominance or laterality. A familial trend in left-handedness has been suggested (Orton 1937; Hallgren, 1950). The same authors believe that cortical dominance problems, left-handedness, language retardation, and reading disability are interrelated and tend to be both familial and genetically determined. My own clinical experiences agree with this hypothesis.
The following features are important in line with my evaluation (1958) of the problem: 1) a slower maturation in language skills, especially reading; 2) a slower neurological patterning with 'soft' neurological signs and motility awkwardness; 3) an uneven pattern of intellectual development; 4) a subsequent reading disability predictable in the preschool period; 5) a poor maturation of cortical dominance, with left-handedness or 'mixed dominance'; 6) confusion in rightleft orientation; 7) immature personality development; 8) the number of boys involved is several times that of girls (as in other developmental problems); 9) familial histories are often significant and

helpful in diagnosis and prognosis; 10) a syndrome with predictable outcome is observed, in which the hereditary pattern is an essential feature.
The inheritance of handedness was recently studied by Falek (1959). He concluded that hand preference is the result of both genetic endowment and early home training. He quoted Ramaley (1913) as having found the genetic mechanism in hand preference to be simple recessive, Chamberlain (1928) as undetermined, and Rife (1940) as polygenic, with Trankell's (1955) statistical analysis of these studies pointing to their agreement. Merrell (1957), like Falek, emphasized the need to consider both heredity and environment.
There is, of course, a great deal more literature on this subject, much of it contradictory. In my own opinion (1958), there is no condition of congenital aphasia in children. The condition most closely resembling it is the early stage of a severe congenital dyslexia. Such children are often slow in developing speech. However, they do so in due time and show the other features of dyslexia, i.e., problems in cortical dominance, family history of language retardation and cortical dominance problems, motor awkwardness, and personality immaturities.
As clinicians we are inclined to think of inheritance only in terms of defects, deficiencies, and disease processes. It should hardly be necessary to remind ourselves that each unique individual child is the product of inheritance working throughout the whole evolutionary process. It has been said by Herrick that "all behavior evolves from a substrate of great antiquity" and by Ginsberg (1954) that "no attempt to explain behavior is complete without taking the genetic and evolutionary aspects into account." This behavior includes the inherited capacity

as well as the necessity to interact with the environment and modify the inherited pattern experientially. Each child also carries the potentials for recreating the race as a carrier of inherited endowments, including the ability to become modified by interaction with the environment.
Potential abilities and special capacities for resisting disease and building defenses are part of the inherited pattern. Documenting such inherited factors is not as readily done as identifying chromosomal pattern disorders or specific enzyme deficiencies or errors in metabolism, but such concepts are a part of genetic thinking. At any rate, Sabin (1954) has shown that genetic factors determine susceptibility and resistance to virus disease of the nervous system.
For example, the difference between girls and boys in respect to the many developmental disorders may be due to special capacities in the female to compensate for these defects, as suggested by Kallmann (1956), or it may be due to a lessened capacity of the male to maturate smoothly, as suggested by Falek (1960).
There are various studies indicating a different incidence and course of mental illnesses, mental deficiency, and other developmental disorders in the two sexes. Apparently the male is more vulnerable to all developmental disorders. It has been reported that all forms of mental deficiency are more common in boys (Malzberg, 1953). Geneticists claim that in man and animals, females demonstrate a propensity for greater biological vigor than males, possibly related to the second X chromosome (Falek). Similar sex differences, with greater resistance on the part of the female, have been documented for neonatal mortality (Vital Statistics) and for congenital malformations (Murphy).

In prepuberty schizophrenia, Kallmann and Roth showed a reduced expectancy for girls under 15, as compared to boys, in the index cases (37 males to 15females), in the schizophrenic co-twins (18 males, 4 females), and in the affected siblings of the index cases (13 males, 5 females). They also found that males had an earlier onset (average 8.8 years) than females (11.1 years). They ascribed these differences to biological or genetic factors. The male/female ratio reverses after puberty, when the number of women exceed men in schizophrenic breakdown progressively with age.
Further data confirming the greater incidence of mental illness and developmental disturbances in boys than in girls were accumulated from the Bellevue children's service and New York State hospital facilities for children. Bender and Yarnell (1941), in a study of 250 children under the age of six in an observation nursery at Bellevue Hospital in a five year period from 1934 to 1939, found a boy/girl ratio of 2/1 for all diagnoses.
In 1951, an analysis of the incidence and course of childhood schizophrenia was made at the children's ward of Bellevue Hospital. Table 4 shows the incidence of schizophrenia in children hospitalized from 1935 to 1951 by age and sex, with boy/girl ratio. It will be noted that the ratio of boys to girls is different for different age levels. The lowest fig-

ures are seen at the 6- to 7-year level, when girls present a picture of acute psychoses from which they may quickly recover. They are highest in boys at the ages of 8 and 9 years, when girls are in remission and more boys tend to be disorganized.
In Table 5, data on all Bellevue children observed in 1950 are tabulated by sex and age and with the boy/girl ratio for all diagnoses. This tabulation shows an even greater preponderance of boys over girls at the 8- and 9-year levels.
When the 1950 population of mentally ill children at Bellevue is studied by diagnoses (Table 6), the largest diagnostic category is represented by schizophrenia with 100 children, or nearly onethird of the total. At the same time, the boy/girl ratio of 3.7 was the lowest for schizophrenia among all diagnostic groups. In behavior problems with acting-out against the environment, boys exceeded girls by 7.4 times.
As Kallmann (1959) has said, "The varying phenotypic expressions of this deficiency (schizophrenia) apparently depend on the type and degree of constitutional defense reactions that can be mobilized against the gene specific vulnerability to stressful life experiences. The difference between the childhood and adult types seems to lie, at least in part, in a number of secondary factors which lower constitutional resistance and interfere with containability of early cases."

According to Dobzhansky (1962), "Genes determine not 'characters' or 'traits' but reactions or responses of the developing organism to its environment."
As our knowledge of specific genetic factors and our working concepts derived from them are enhanced, our understanding of mentally ill children is also bound tobe broadened. Along these lines it will become possible to apply bothspecific and empiric preventive methods and therapies.
