A MULTIPLE VARIABLE APPROACH TO THE ASSORTATIVE MATING PHENOMENON

In recent years a renewed interest in the study of the phenomenon of assortative mating has developed. This paper examines assortative mating as it may be operating through three different characteristics of spouses. Educational level, socioeconomic origin status, and number of siblings of one spouse are shown to be correlated with the same characteristics of the other spouse. By considering variables simultaneously, mate selection by educational level can be seen to explain much of the correlation found for the other two variables because of the known intercorrelations between the three variables within the individual. The implications and extentions of such a simultaneous analysis of variables pertaining to assortative mating may be of interest to those studying population genetics as well as those interested in sociological questions.
Both biologists and sociologists have taken an interest in this topic. Sixty years ago the biologist F. E. Lutz was one of the first to point out the relevance of assortative mating to biologists and sociologists. In a study where he examined the relationship between stature, span, forearm length, and longevity of spouses, he concluded with the following statement:
The writer has on hand data which show that this principle (homogamy) applies to certain insects and spiders as well as man. So that we are doubtlessly dealing here with a real biological factor as well as one of sociological interest (Lutz, 1905).

Two recent articles emphasize the importance of assortative mating for human genetics. Spuhler provides an extensive review of the literature, along with results of his own research on assortative mating in Ann Arbor, Michigan (Spuhler, 1962). The essential hypothesis that relates assortative mating to human genetics stated by Spuhler says, "The population consequences of positive assortative mating (homogamy) are similar to those for inbreeding in that the proportion of heterozygous genotypes is reduced, and that of homozygous genotypes increased, in comparison with the proportions expected under random mating" (Spuhler, 1962).
The other article linking assortative mating to population genetics deals with social characteristics such as educational level and socioeconomic status. Kiser used census data to show that assortative mating takes place with regard to these two characteristics and suggests that this may have implications for those who are studying population genetics (Kiser, 1965).

Assortative mating encompasses all

mate selection which is not random mat-

ing. The most frequent type is homogamy, which is the mating1 of spouses

with like characteristics. A substantial

At present there are two prevalent theories as to how assortative mating takes place: (1) It occurs either as a re-

suit of the propinquity of the potential spouses (Marvin, 1918), or (2) it occurs as the result of some conscious selection by the person of a mate that is like himself with regard to a certain characteristic (Burgess and Wallin, 1943).
The following analysis describes and evaluates the effects of certain variables on assortative mating when the variables are considered as a system, rather than individually. In most studies in the past a single variable has been examined with regard to its role in assortative mating. Since most of the variables used are correlated with each other, they need to be examined simultaneously. The methodological issue involved here was formulated as follows by Karl Pearson:
. . . for two very distinct characters, stature and eye-colour, we have found quite sensible measures of homogamy. We cannot doubt in the face of this that like actually tends to mate with like in the case of man. Whether this arises directly from choice in stature or in eye-colour, or from choice of correlated organs it is not possible to determine. If from the latter source, then it is very probable that the measure of homogamy would be somewhat larger, if we could hit upon the directly selected organ (Pearson, 1900).
Unfortunately, neither Pearson nor subsequent investigators dealt adequately with the problem of how to distinguish a "directly selected" from a "correlated organ" and how to show that assortment with respect to the latter is a consequence of assortment on the former.
Data are available to examine the roles of education and socioeconomic origin status, along with number of siblings and first job status, in a representative sample of American couples. The data are from the tabulations of the study "Occupational Changes in a Generation" (Blau and Duncan, 1961). The sample is a national cross section, clustered sample

of American males. The information is based on the March 1962 Current Population Survey conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census and a supplementary questionnaire left by the interviewer for completion by each male 20 to 64 years old in households which fell in the sample. Over 33,000 households were visited. The results of these interviews were weighted and inflated to conform to the noninstitutional population of the U.S. in the 1960 census with regard to age, color, and sex.
The tabulations under analysis here are restricted to those males in the sample currently married and living with their wives. Data were obtained on the number of school years completed by the husband and wife as of the 1962 survey date, the number of siblings of each, the occupation of the husband's father and the wife's father when each spouse was age sixteen, and the occupation of the husband in his first full-time job. It is impossible to determine from these data whether marriage preceded, coincided with, or followed the completion of all schooling of the spouses. In general, it can be assumed that the measures on father's occupation precede the time of marriage. The number of siblings need not have been fixed by the time of marriage. Thus the present results are not strictly comparable with those that would be obtained with a sample of marriages in which the spouses' characteristics pertain to the date of marriage.
Educational level, socioeconomic origin status as determined by the occupational status score of the mate's father using Duncan's scale (Reiss and others, 1961). and the number of siblings of each mate are used to determine the amount of assortative mating present. When wives are grouped by age for the white population as in Table 1, the cor-

relations between educational levels of husbands and wives range around .6; the correlations between the socioeconomic origin statuses of the two spouses are about .3; and the correlations between number of siblings of each spouse are near .2. Examining the correlations for the nonwhite groups one sees that they

tend to fluctuate somewhat more. It is also true that there is a substantially smaller number of cases for them. For this reason the nonwhites will not be included in further analysis here. One can conclude that there is a strong tendency for assortative mating to take place by educational levels, a moderate tendency for socioeconomic origin status to sort mates, and a weaker relationship for number of siblings.
It is well known that these three variables are correlated with each other; hence the homogamy tendencies observed may be just an artifact of mates sorted on one variable without the other two entering in directly. It is for this reason that a system of variables must be used, so that assortative mating might be studied using several related variables simultaneously. Table 2 shows a correlation matrix with the means and standard deviations for each variable for the 27-31 year age group. It may be considered as being typical of each of the other age groups with only slight variations. This age group was selected because it was the age group nearest to the present time for which most members

are likely to have completed their education.
Whether one believes the propinquity theory or the "conscious homogamy" theory, he is led to see that educational level is the important factor. With this in mind, and the fact that there is a correlation between education level and socioeconomic origin status, one might suspect that the association between socioeconomic origins of the mates might be greatly reduced if the correlation between education and father's socioeconomic status was controlled.
Table 3 lists the zero-order correlations between socioeconomic origin status and the partial correlations between socioeconomic origin status with education of the mates controlled, and with education, number of siblings, and first job status of the couple controlled.
The effect of controlling for the association between educational levels of the spouses is to reduce substantially the correlation between their socioeconomic origin statuses. For the younger age groups it cuts the correlation almost in half, and for the older groups it is reduced by only about one-third. When education, number of siblings, and first job are taken into account the correlation is reduced by at least 45 percent in all age groups. One would conclude that

almost half the association between socioeconomic origin status of mates is due to assortative mating by education. The correlation that remains for origin status can be thought of as a direct effect of the parent's status on the mate selection of their offspring. This direct effect may be thought of either as a conscious awareness by the potential mates of the other person's socioeconomic origin status, or it may result from direct parental influence in the selection of a mate as Sussman suggests (Sussman, 1963). Educational level has a much larger effect than does number of siblings. The data support Schiller's finding that there is little or no assortative mating by number of siblings (Schiller, 1936).
We have seen that there is a strong tendency for assortative mating to take place by education; that over half of the moderate assortative mating by socioeconomic origin can be accounted for by the assortative mating by educational level; and that number of siblings and firstjob of the husband play a very minor role in assortative mating. Table 4 is included so that the reader can examine the patterns of assortative mating by education and socioeconomic origin. The table presents ratios (for all age groups of the population combined) which show the degree to which combinations occur with greater or lesser frequency than would be expected on the hypothesis of random mating. Examining the top panel, one sees that for education the ratios along the main diagonal exceed unity, and that one or two steps off the diagonal the value of the ratios decreases sharply. For the socioeconomic origin ratios in the bottom panel it appears that the ratios decrease as one moves away from the diagonal, but that the ratios remain relatively near unity with several exceptions to the de-

creasing patterns. In considering this type of ratio the marginal frequencies should always be considered. The pattern of the ratios supports the conclusion that assortative mating by educational levels is much more pronounced than by socioeconomic origin status.
By making the plausible assumption that educational level of the potential mates is the chief characteristic by which assortative mating takes place we were able to account for a significant part of the correlation for another prominent characteristic, socioeconomic origin status.
The question as to why assortative mating exists remains unanswered. Whether it occurs because people actually seek spouses with characteristics similar to their own, or whether people are sorted

spatially by some characteristic and then marry someone who is at hand, still has not been determined. Neither hypothesis is contradicted here. Both of the following arguments seem plausible. Education sorts people into physically separate groups at a time when they are most likely to marry. Those people who drop out of high school have little or no contact with those who remain in school. Those who finish high school, but do not go on to college, get jobs that are different from those who dropped out of school and therefore are not in close association with the high school dropout group, and they are also isolated from those who go away to college. Likewise, the college student is isolated from the high school dropout and the high school graduate. On the other

hand, educational level may be a variable that mirrors social psychological variables relating to aspirations, goals, and styles of life which are probably seen as important characteristics to have in common with one's mate.
While the analysis presented in this paper would support either hypothesis concerning the process by which assortative mating occurs (and it may well be that both are operating), the significance of the paper rests in the fact that there are interrelationships which exist between the characteristics of the individual, which in turn may result in correlations between characteristics of spouses, which may not be intuitively obvious or easily explained without examining simultaneously all the characteristics that are involved. It remains to be seen if selection of a mate on a basis of a similarity of educational level may also result in a selection to some degree on such characteristics as intelligence, height, or other characteristics that might be passed on to the offspring of such a union. It also remains to be determined how the social psychological variables mentioned are associated between spouses when selection has been on a basis of similarity in educational level.
In order that this might be done there is a need for investigators in severalfields to collaborate or at least supply comparable data that will allow an examination of the interrelationships between variables involved in the assortative mating phenomenon.
