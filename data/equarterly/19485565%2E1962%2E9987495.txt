PRELIMINARY REPORT OF ACTIVITIES OF THE CONSANGUINITY STUDY GROUP OF THE SCIENCE COUNCIL OF JAPAN*

JAPANESE PEOPLE have several characteristics making them favorable material for genetic study. Above all, consanguineous marriages are much more frequent than among average Europeans. Moreover, families are larger and their members are less dispersed. Registration records are fairly complete and reliable. Some of these demographic characteristics, however, are rapidly disappearing.
In November, 1957, the Science Council of Japan organized a subcommittee of consanguinity study under its Genetics Committee for the study of this problem. The subcommittee under the chairmanship of Professor T. Komai secured the cooperation of 64 investigators and 68 collaborators, outlined a project of study, and started its activities in the summer of 1958. The Ministry of Education of the Japanese Government and the Rockefeller Foundation gave generous financial support to the study.
Our activities consist of three branches: 1) studies on school children in Shizuoka, 2) studies on residents of isolated villages, and 3) studies on patients of some common hereditary diseases. :
*Presented at the Tenth Pacific Science Congress of the Pacific Science Association, Honolulu, August 21 to September 6,1961.

Most of the field work has been completed, and we are in the stage of arranging the data for statistical treatment and further genetic study. This paper should, therefore, be considered as an interim report.
Somewhat previous to our project, human geneticists of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, under the chairmanship of Professor J. V. Neel, had launched another project with similar purposes to study children in Hiroshima, Kure and Nagasaki.
1. THE SHIZUOKA STUDIES
The city of Shizuoka was chosen for its similarity in population size (about 300,000) and in the cultural status of its residents to Hiroshima, Kure and Nagasaki. Our data, therefore, may be directly comparable with findings obtained at these cities in western Japan. Shizuoka (Fig. 1) is easily accessible, located midway between Tokyo and Nagoya, and Dr. Okamoto and his staff of Saiseikai Hospital there were highly cooperative.
From 12 primary schools of the city 9,320 children were subjected to anthropométrie and psychometric measurements and to medical examinations. Accurate data on blood relationship of their parents were obtained. The registration records in the city office served for this

purpose. It was sometimes possible to trace back pedigrees as far as five generations making it possible to get precise data on the degree of consanguinity. The data thus obtained were carefully checked by information obtained in interviews with parents and relatives. This genealogical work also furnished us with data on the mortality of the sibs of the children under examination.
Japon
Figuie 1. Map o£ the city o£ Shizuoka.
All children were accurately measured for stature, weight, chest circumference, sitting height, head circumference, head length, head breadth, head-ear height, and acromion breadth.
These children were also given psychometric tests of Binet-Tnaka scheme.
Medical examinations of the children were also carried out. Lack of time and facilities prevented us making thorough examinations of all of them. After making preliminary examinations of all the children, 794 offspring of consanguineous marriages and about 3,000 offspring of control non-consanguineous marriages were subjected to thorough examinations by experts of various specialties.
Dr. K. Ohkura and his assistants arranged all anthropométrie, psychometric and medical data for statistical treatments, while Dr. K. Ito is performing the

mathematical analysis of the data. The present analysis is preliminary.
As Table I shows, the rate of cousin marriages among the parents of the children was 4.42%, and the mean coefficient of inbreeding (F) was 0.0044. The rate varied according to districts within the city. Consanguinity among residents of the peripheral regions was distinctly higher than among those in the central region (F. 0.00822 vs. 0.00238). Table 2 shows the frequency of consanguinity by individual which is somewhat different from that of family.
The 12 schools were classified according to the grade of consanguinity of the parents into group A--peripheral regions (4 schools, 823 families, F=0.00749-- 0.01157); group B--middle regions (6 schools, 3,142 families, F = 0.00412-- 0.00667) and group G--central regions (2 schools, 2,195 families, F=0.00236-- 0.00246). Mortality including natural abortions, stillbirths, and deaths before six years of age among children of nonconsanguineous versus consanguineous marriages (of the grade up to first cousins) is shown in Table 3. These data are analyzed statistically in Table 4. This table indicates that the mortality in the consanguineous children is significantly higher in groups B and C than that in the non-consanguineous controls. No such tendency is apparent in group A. We suspect that bad environmental conditions in homes of the A group have raised child mortality and obscured the mortality due to genetic causes.
The regression of stature and body weight on inbreeding coefficient and age are shown in Tables 5 and 6. The regression of stature and body weight in males of group A and of stature in females of group B shows significant values. Other regressions show no significant values, and that of body weight in

Examination on problems of intelligence are still in progress.
Table 7 shows the incidence of color blindness. Ophthalmologists in our group have found an incidence of colorvision deficiency among boys of 4.89% and among girls of 0.28%. These figures are nearly identical with those commonly known for Japanese. The ophthalmologists also attempted to discriminate hétérozygotes of color-vision deficiency by means of a flicker photometer. Sixty per cent of hétérozygotes for protanopy have been defected by a slight deficiency of sensitivity to the light on

the longer-wave length. Radiographie examinations have dis-
covered various minute anomalies of ossification in hands, which would have passed unnoticed by ordinary observations. Some of these may be of genetic interest. The orthopedic investigators also obtained material for bone-age determination. Odontologists made careful examinations of the dentition of more than 2,500 children by taking plaster casts and radiograms of the dentition.

Kyoto, Wakayama, Nagano and Fukushima and examined residents of isolated villages in their vicinities. These studies were designed to elucidate breeding structure, size of the isolates and its changing trend, effect of genetic drift and the distribution of genes for various he-

reditary traits. It was also hoped that cases of some rare genetic diseases might be discovered by the survey. The consanguinity relationship of the residents was studied from registration records, as well as by interviewing relatives and elderly people. Special attention was given

to data on fecundity, abortions, stillbirths, neo-natal and infantile deaths. ABO and MN blood types, P.T.C. taste deficiency, color-vision deficiency of the villagers were also studied. Medical examinations were carried out on most subjects. The rate of consanguinity between married couples among the residents was often much higher than the corresponding figures in other parts of the country.
A comparative study of all the data is under progress by Dr. T. Yanase. For in-

stance, the Hoshino isolate which is typical of those studied contains complicated types of consanguineous marriages in high frequency, so that the mean degree of inbreeding is several times higher than those found in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Figure 2 shows changes in the degree of isolation with time as examined by classifying the material of two isolates (Hn and OS) according to the year of marriage beginning at 1906 in 10-year intervals. The inbreeding coefficient (F) reached its peak during the 1916-1925 or 1926-1935 period, and decreased gradually to 1955 when it dropped abruptly. As in other areas, a wider choice of marriage partners has become possible in recent years.
In such isolates, the question arises as to the relative meaning of consanguinity (Stern). Special calculations are required to find a true F value in these populations. Such studies have been done by Yanase (in press) with the data of some isolates in Kyushu.
The relative incidence of the four

subtypes of consanguineous matings as studied in isolate populations is shown in Table 8. A and B types are relatively smaller than in the general Japanese population where these types are distinctly larger than C and D, so that the mean F value shows a tendency to approach the corresponding random value.
3 . STUDIES ON PATIENTS OF SOME COMMON
HEREDITARY DISEASES
Blindness: Dr. Nakajima and Professor Hagiwara made an extensive survey of

the causes of blindness on inmates of schools for the blind, and of rehabilitation centers of the whole country. Questionnaires relative to 8,709 blind patients were answered. Table 9 shows that 23.3% were children of consanguineous marriages, including 16.7% of cousin marriages. Analysis of these data aids in the reexamination of current views of inheritance of some eye diseases. For example, the incidence of consanguinity among parents of the patients of hydrophthalmos and glaucoma was 27.5%, while the

Deaf-mutism: Dr. T. Furusho examined 892 deaf children in schools for the deaf in prefectures near Tokyo with an audiometer. The consanguinity of their parents and the mortality and abnormalities among sibs were studied byregistration records and interviews. Graduates of these schools were also similarly studied. Results are shown in Table 10. A similar study on deaf children is being carried out by Dr. T. Mori in the Prefecture Yamaguchi. Both investigators paid special attention to the difference between congenital and acquired deafness. The extensive data thus obtained are being analyzed. Furusho has discovered three marriages between congenital deaf patients who had each congenital deaf sibs with normal progeny. This finding strongly suggests the pres-

Mental deficiency: Kishimoto studied 649 mentally retarded children in primary and middle schools in Nagoya. The children were classified according to their I.Q. scores into debilitates (I.Q. 70-51), imbeciles (50-26) and idiots (25 and less). Among idiots more cases due to non-genetic causes were discovered than among debilitates and imbeciles. However, as Table 11 shows, the consanguinity of parents is highest for idiots (13%). The study of parity suggests that the second- or third-borns are more frequently affected than the first-borns.
