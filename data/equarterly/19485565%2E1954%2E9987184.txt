I. THE BREAK-UP OF ISOLATES Its Genetic Consequences in Two French Départements*

JEAN SUTTER LEON TABAH

TLHE THEORY OF PANMIXIA, made use of in
the genetics of population, presupposes numerous exceptions in actuality. The disappearance of consanguineous marriage in a recent period clearly reveals that marriage customs have evolved to a great extent from one generation to another. The break-up of isolates is examined here in reference to two French départements: Loir-et-Cher (population 240,000) and Finistère (population 750,000). In both cases we are concerned with two periods: Loir-et-Cher 1919-1925 and 1944-1953; Finistère 1919 and 1951-June 1953. Changes in frequency of consanguineous marriages are studied for each commune, of which there are as many as 297 in each département. The break-up of isolates appears as a recent phenomenon and its consequences on the genetic structure of the population are important, as is shown by statistical studies limited to the most endogamous communes. Mortality must have been lowered automatically thereby.
*More complete results will be published in Population, journal of the Institut National d'Études Démographiques (Paris).

I The genetics of population in its essential theories poses the hypothesis of panmixia; in other words, the population is enclosed, marriages are made at random, and fertility is identical for all couples. This hypothesis is far from the true facts; six exceptions can be distinguished thus far to panmixia: (1) selection (differential fertility) ; (2) consanguinity; (3) choice of spouse; (4) mutations; (5) migrations; (6) the full complement and the limits of the population. It is not necessary for the population to be unlimited for panmixia ío be realized. One can imagine that marriages are contracted at random in populations large or small. There exists, however, an essential difference between the two extremes. The distribution of genotypes turns out to be stable in the course of time if the complement of the population is sufficiently great. If the complement is reduced, this distribution becomes modified from one generation to another. Again in this last case the population must be enclosed; otherwise the migratory exchanges would act in the same manner as an increase in the complement.

In actual fact the population of one nation is divided into segmented populations in continual transformation. Dahlberg has called isolate each one of these populations of limited complement within which an individual can find his spouse. We know now that there exist purely demographic isolates or isolates of a religious, ethnic, social, or professional origin. Presumably isolates, before the development of industrial civilization, must have maintained from ancient times a certain rigidity and a stable make-up. This stability would have been destroyed in the course of the nineteenth century by the development of industries, transportation facilities, the extension of migration, etc. We have few precise data on the extent of this phenomenon, which has been called the breakup of isolates. We have tried here to establish some data, both past and present, on this problem while studying the evolution of isolates and its genetic consequences in two French départements.
As in Dahlberg's hypothesis we assume that within the communes or groups of communes studied marriages are made at random. Therefore the number of consanguineous marriages testifies to the size of the isolate, that is, to the number of individuals among whom the spouse can be chosen. The exactness of this hypothesis will be verified subsequently by examining the distance existing between the residences of the spouses.
II The two départements under consideration are Loir-et-Cher (Loire Valley) and Finistère (Brittany). Both are little urbanized. The former can be considered as representatives of 35 or 40 French départements where exogamy seems to have prevailed for a long time; the latter ranks among the 10 or 15 départements where endogamy has remained strong until now. Finistère differs from Loir-et-Cher mainly in three respects: the frequency of consanguineous marriages has remained high until recently; there are

fewer outsiders; and fertility is greater, iince it can be estimated that the mean family size is greater by one than that of Loir-et-Cher.
As in our previous studies, the statistics on consanguineous marriages are based on religious dispensations granted by ecclesiastical authorities consisting of the following degrees: between uncle and niece and aunt and nephew (third degree) ; first cousins (fourth degree) : cousins of unequal degree (fifth degree), the issue of first cousins (sixth degree) ; and double cousins. The ecclesiastical statistics are compared with the state marriage statistics io allow for the possible incidence of purely civil marriages.
Thanks to the archives of the Bishop of Blois (Loir-et-Cher) we have been able to establish valid statistics on the rate of consanguineous marriages during several periods between 1812 and 1953: 1812; 1826-1857; 1870-1877; 1891-1953. The character of the development of the frequency of these marriages is as follows: from 1812 to 1835 it is roughly constant (between 2 and 3 per cent) with only one or two years running higher figures than these; it then rises above 3 per cent and, except for a few years at 4 per cent, in actual fact remains there until the First World War, when it falls slightly. This frequency returns to 4.1 and 3.7 per cent for 1919 and 1920, respectively, only to fall once more. In 1923 it is at 1.9 per cent, maintaining itself roughly at this figure during the following years, only to slump finally from 1931 onward (0.9 per cent). It rises only slightly during the Second World War. During the fifties it falls to 0.4 and 0.5 per cent.
A few comments can be made on this 150year development. The increase of the years 1830-1835 coincides with a demographic expansion; the population of Loiret-Cher then increased rapidly from 211,000 to 270,000 inhabitants, which could explain the increase of endogamy. The

influence of wars is conspicuous: the war of 1870-1871 had brought about a slight increase which was shown again in 1914-- 1918, this time in a definite manner, and, less strongly, in 1939-1945.
For Finistère we have precise figures only after 1911. Figure 1 shows the development of the frequency of consanguineous marriages since this date in comparison with Loir-et-Cher. We see that the decrease has been rapid since the Second World War as the rate changes from 5.6 per cent in 1919 to 0.6 per cent in 1946. It is easy to see that the two curves have the same profile. The influence of the two world wars, if not simultaneous, is equally clear. The important thing is to establish whether or not there exists a displacement of 15 years between the two terminal points of the development of the number of consanguineous marriages; the situation in Finistère since 1946 is comparable, in

all its elements, with that in Loir-et-Cher since 1931. This fact, added to the picture given us by Loir-et-Cher for 150 years, shows that the theory that isolates have been breaking up since the beginning of the nineteenth century is not exact, at least if we restrict ourselves only to the example of France. This breaking up seems to be a recent phenomenon which has had repercussions largely on the existing generations. Let us now estimate the breadth of this phenomenon while examining what took place at the level of each of the communes of the two départements.
Ill On the basis of the preceding data, we have studied the development of isolates in the course of one generation, that is, from 1919 to 1953. Table 1 shows the period studied in Loir-et-Cher with their demographic characteristics (census of 1921 and 1946) :

The ecclesiastical archives of Loir-et-Cher allow us to distribute the spouses according to the commune of their origin. Apart from these figures we have been able to establish for each commune the number of consanguineous spouses per 1,000 inhabitants. If the consanguineous spouses had been distributed homogeneously throughout the whole département, we should have found 4.4 per 1,000 inhabitants during the first period under consideration and 1.2 during the second. According to these figures, the communes were distributed as in Table 2.
According to the 1919 figures, 4.4 and over, the number of communes fell from 120 to 20. According to the 1944-1953 figures, 1.2 and over, the number fell from 220 to 88. We see that the disappearance of consanguineous marriages from one period to the other is not at a rate correspond-

ing with the figures; the disappearance is more evident in the higher figures. A more searching study would show that this is in accordance with a purely demographic factor: the number of inhabitants per commune. We may add that each of the six natural geographic regions of Loir-et-Cher presents its own evolutionary character.
For Finistère the years studied with their demographic characteristics (census of 1921 and 1946) are shown in Table 3.
Ecclesiastical statistics do not allow us to establish the number of consanguineous spouses per commune but only the number of consanguineous marriages per 1,000 inhabitants. (See Table 4).) If they were distributed homogeneously throughout the communes, we should have had 0.9 per 1,000 inhabitants in the first period and 0.2 in the second.

At the 1919 rate, 0.9 and over, the number of communes fell from 123 to 30; at the 1951-1953 rate, 0.2 and over, from 201 to90. As in Loir-et-Cher, we can see that the highest rates are the ones affected by the decrease. Geographically, the distribution is also very significant.

of the size of isolates, reckoned from the percentage of marriages of the sixth degree, provides supplementary proof of this. The totals are recorded in Tables 5 and 6 both for the départements and for the most endogamous communes of each. They show the number of persons from among whom, during two different periods, spouses could have been chosen. The entirely theoretical aspect of these figures should be kept in

cients of consanguinity. Table 7 shows how these coefficients have varied in the group of communes which we have just cited, and for the periods studied.
In these, the most endogamous communes, the decrease of the mean coefficient of consanguinity is due above all to the quasi disappearance of marriages of the fourth degree. On the other hand, marriages of the sixth degree still represent 2.5

per cent of the marriages in Loir-et-Cher and 1.8 per cent of the marriages in Finistère.
For the periods studied we have inquired into the theoretical number of carriers of one or two characteristics born of marriages of the fourth to the sixth degree per 100 carriers in the total population. We have adopted the simplest hypothesis, that of monohybrid, autosomic, and recessive characteristics, and we have assumed that the gene frequencies were 10-1 and 10J^2 in the population. Table 8 shows the results of this calculation:
We see that the carriers of one characteristic, and even more the carriers of two characteristics, were relatively numerous in the period following the Second World War among the descendants of consanguineous marriages, even when the characteristics were very widespread in the population (p = 0.1). In Loir-et-Cher, in 19191925 nearly 40 per cent of the carriers of two characteristics (the gene frequencies of which were 10-3/2) would have theoretically been the issue of marriages of the fourth to the sixth degree, which nevertheless represented only 12 per cent of the total marriages. Nor have we yet taken into account the possible recombinations between loci. It has been shown that one of the effects of a strong endogamy is the augmentation of the frequency of carriers of several characteristics, for, among consanguineous couples, the frequency of multiple récessives is more greatly increased than of simple récessives, compared with non-consanguine-

ous couples. This phenomenon is more especially pronounced as the variance of the coefficients of consanguinity of the various couples constituting the population is small, which is the case among the most endogamous populations.
The influence of consanguinity in causing rare characteristics to appear has lessened considerably in recent years as a result of the great decrease in marriages of the fourth degree. Variance in the coefficient of consanguinity must have simultaneously increased greatly.
It should be emphasized that the preceding computations assume that unions other than those of the fourth to sixth degree have negligible coefficients of consanguinity. But this evaluation appears doubtful for the communes studied, for endogamy is particularly strong there; unions of the sixth degree are relatively numerous, and it seems hazardous to assume that unions of the immediately higher degrees are almost non-existent. On this basis, the figures obtained above ought to be considered as overestimated, especially for the earliest period. Although this cause for error is not negligible, it cannot be denied that the decrease in the rate of consanguinity has resulted in the marked lowering of the frequency of the rarest characteristics.
VI
To show the importance of this transformation of marriage to the level of the great demographic problems, we have exhaustively studied the death rate in eight

communes of Finistère: Plozevet, Esquibien, Goulien, lie de Sein, Cleden cap Sizun, Plogoff, Primelin and Mahalon. From 1919 to 1929 there were 1,893 marriages in these communes, of which 183 were consanguineous from the third to the sixth degree. Comparison of mortality, at different ages, among the descendants of the 183 consanguineous marriages and among the descendants of 281 families taken at random from among the 1,710 non-con-

sanguineous has given the results in Table 9.
We see that the break-up of isolates has contributed by a far from negligible fraction to the lowering of mortality in these communes from one generation to the other. We can say in closing that the profound changes which have recently taken place have strongly influenced the genetic structure of the populations studied and their demographic constants.
