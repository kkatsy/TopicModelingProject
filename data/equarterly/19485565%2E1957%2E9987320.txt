INTRODUCTION

A,LMONG THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF MED-
ICINE, ophthalmology is particularly well
placed for the study of human genetic changes. First, hereditary ocular characteristics and lesions are numerous. Secondly, the transparent media of the eye permit examination of the lesions with a precision unknown in the other domains of medicine. This is why ophthalmologists have also become geneticists.
For a physician genetics must not only be a pure science but a useful science to his patients. Medical art naturally consists in healing, but it also consists more and more in prevention. It is essentially in preventing the dissemination of hereditary diseases that genetics finds its usefulness. In the present state of our society prevention cannot be practiced in the whole population. Obligatory social eugenics, which gravely restricts the individual liberty of the parents, is not applicable today nor to be hoped for in the future, to our way of thinking at least. On an individual basis, however, the physician may be called on to counsel parents on the risk of having a child with a particular disease. He establishes a genetic prognosis founded on the study of the family in question (number of cases, consanguinity, etc.) and on the

laws of genetics which apply to this disease. This genetic prognosis permits the physician to express in percentages the risk for the parents of having children with this disease. If the risk is high, it may be best to advise against procreation, and possibly even against marriage, but of course this is only a suggestion. The final decision rests with the husband and wife, who are free to act as they please.
The establishment of a genetic prognosis always requires study of the individual family, calculation, and often meticulous research. That is why we thought it would be useful to draw up tables which recapitulate the large majority of the situations in which consultation is sought. On the left of the tables are listed those diseases which are sufficiently grave to justify a genetic consultation. In the remaining columns are the appropriate prognoses according to the family history, for example, father affected, no other cases in the family, parents first cousins. The designation of relationships is always given in relation to the child to be born.
Families may also be classified according to the mode of transmission of the disease. For example, in the case of retinitis pigmentosa (a degenerative disease of the eye that eventually leads to blindness) the risk is the same when any grandparent is affected, but in sex-linked diseases, such as colorblindness, the risk depends on which of the four grandparents is affected.
In order to avoid one excessively large and inconvenient table, we have made three

tables: one for the autosomal (not sex- not related, the risk of a child's being strick-

R = 2q- 2q-y4 = q* 2. If the family history is negative but the parents are related, the risk is considerably augmented. This supplementary risk can be calculated from special for-

DOMINANT AUTOSOMAL EYE DISEASES
(See Table 2)
We have indicated twenty dominant eye diseases sufficiently grave to have need of a genetic consultation. These are:
Congenital cataracts, dystrophia myotonica, hemeralopia (Nougaret's type), granular corneal dystrophy, lattice-like corneal dystrophy, familial atrophy of the optic nerve (different from Leber's disease) aniridia, glaucoma, neurofibromatosis (von Recklinghausen), osteopsathyrosis (Lobstein) , retinoblastoma, ptosis congenita, epiloia (tuberous sclerosis) (von HippelLindau's disease), craniofacial dysostosis (Crouzon), colobomatous conditions, oxycephaly, Marian's syndrome, acrocephalosyndactily (Apert), Struge-Weber's disease.
We know today that diseases called dominant are rarely completely dominant. There are practically always a certain number of hétérozygotes who apparently are not affected. What we call the penetrance of the gene is the percentage of hétérozygotes obviously stricken. The calculation of penetrance is most important for the genetic prognosis of dominant conditions. In effect the risk is always less than that predicted by the Mendelian ratio for absolute dominance. We cannot discuss here the different ways of calculating this penetrance. Our estimates are based on the published literature and on our personal calculations and evaluations.
1. In order to shorten the table, we have omitted mention of the risk of a stricken child in a family in which there has never been a manifestation. With or without consanguinity this risk is practically nothing. It is equal to the rate of mutation.
2. If one parent is affected, the risk of the next child being affected is 1:2, a risk which is proportionately diminished accord-
p ing to the lack of penetrance R = ---
3. Unlike recessive disease there is only

a small increase in risk with consanguinity in dominant conditions (see Table 2).
4. If both parents are affected, one-half of the children will be homozygotes, probably more seriously stricken than the parents themselves; one-half will be hétérozygotes of whom P/2 are stricken in the same way as the parents. Thus, with complete penetrance, three-fourths of the children would be affected. As a matter of fact this proportion is almost always smaller.
5. If healthy parents already have an affected child, we must first think of a mutation. In this case the risk of the next child being affected would be almost nil. We can, however, also admit a direct transmission by one of the parents, who would then be a latent carrier because of lack of penetrance. These two conditions were taken into account. The first was given a weight nine times that of the second.

congenital nystagmus, dyschromatopsia, hemeralopia (recessive type, different from Nougaret's type), choroideremia, Leber's optic atrophy, and ocular albinism (albinism of the eye only).
Sex-linked heredity is characterized by lack of transmission from affected father to son. A healthy male cannot transmit a sexlinked disease, even if the disease exists in the family. On the contrary, any woman related to an affected male may be a carrier of the disease, provided that the relationship is effected through an uninterrupted chain of women.
1. In a healthy family, the risk is very small for a son, and practically nil for a daughter. In order to shorten our table we have omitted to mention it.
2. In a healthy family, the risk is practically the same with or without consanguinity.
3. If one parent is affected, the risk depends upon the parent and the penetrance
a) father affected R Ô= 0 R 5 as P
if P = 0, as in recessive sex-linked affections, R = 0. All the daughters, however, will be carriers, able to transmit the disease.
b) mother affected (1) incompletely dominant diseases (Congenital nystagmus, Leber's diseases) RS = 5 5 % . R 2 = 55%.P
(risk is greater than 50% because the mother may be homozygous).
(2) recessive affections
R $ = 99%.
4. Consanguinity can increase the above risk but only if the relationship of the parents is effected through women or through affected males (without interposition of a single healthy male). If, for example, the parents are first cousins, the risk can be increased by consanguinity only if the affec-

ted parent is the father and if the relationship is through the mother of the affected father and through the mother of the healthy mother. Under these circumstances consanguinity increases the risk for both sons and daughters (see Table 3). The rather complicated formulae are not developed here for lack of space.
5. If one grandparent is affected, the paternal grandparents cannot transmit the disease through their healthy son. On the contrary the maternal grandparents can transmit the disease (see Table 3).
6. The same for the uncle (aunt).

CONCLUSIONS
The establishment of a prognosis in genetics is more delicate that might commonly be supposed, especially if we wish to take advantage of the progress made by genetics in recent years. It requires a great deal of information which is often difficult to bring together, for example, the frequency of a disease in the population, the rate of mutation, the degree of penetrance, etc. Often there is no precise, published figure in the literature. So we must content ourselves with a personal evaluation, which is evidently somewhat arbitrary. Genetic prognosis requires in addition to all this certain special mathematical procedures which can seem very difficult to those who use them only occasionally.
Faced with this complex problem we decided to establish tables which would be easy to consult and which would indicate immediately the chances of a child being stricken. These percentages have only suggestive value. They can be modified according to particulars of heredity in a specific family. It should also be said that in families theoretical ratios are rarely realized. Each case is subject to the same degree of chance, exactly as if we were to play a slot machine only once.
Without enforcing obligatory measures offensive to human liberty, we think that
