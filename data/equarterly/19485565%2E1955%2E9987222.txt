RELATION OF POPULATION CHANGES TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF GENETIC FACTORS
Report on Meeting 23 of the World Population Conference, Rome 1954

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 06:37 07 December 2015

Introduction
In opening Meeting 23 of the World Population Conference, Book pointed out that the most important fact we have to face in relation to all problems of human populations is the tremendous diversity of the individuals who make up these populations. Cultural diversities have long been studied. The more recent studies of genetic diversities are in the field of the rapidly growing sciences of genetics and biology. But man's diversity in regard to his genetic potentialities has such far-reaching consequences that it should not and cannot be left to the consideration of only biologists and geneticists. If there is to be a realistic science of man, individual and group genetic differences cannot be disregarded.
This meeting is concerned with human genetic differences in the larger framework of population genetics and medical genetics. The genetic base underlying individual differences in mental and emotional development is not yet well understood and is the subject of Meeting 25.
The science of population genetics is just coming of age. Its theoretical aspects were developed more than a score of years ago by Haldane, Wright and others. Its experimental work was confined chiefly to drosophila. Objective data on human beings seemed far in the future. But all this has been changed by the use made of the blood groups in the years since the war, by other means of determining genetically determined traits, and by improved methods of measuring consanguinity.
The papers presented to this session reflect this change. Sanghvi measures the genetic relationship of the different castes

in India described by Wahlund as the world's largest experimental material for the study of human genetics. Sutter and Tabah describe the breakup of isolates in France: "l'Eclatment des Isolats." Kishimoto, Matsunago, Komatu, and Furuhata describe differential survival in Japan under different types of mating and for various characteristics. Demographers, geneticists, and anthropologists in great numbers are making objective studies on the population genetics of man. As the psychologists follow suit, our understanding of the effects of migration, racial admixtures, and differential mortality and fertility should make rapid and cumulative growth.
In the medical field, human diversity expresses itself in three main directions, namely, in (1) genetic diseases or defects, caused by specific and potent gene mutations; (2) individual gene constellations which constitute a necessary prerequisite for the environmental causation of aspecific disorder; and (3) individual gene constellations which constitute an important basis of reaction types to be considered in terms of vulnerability or predisposition for disease as well as for health and in terms of individual response to therapeutic measures. The first part of the meeting was concerned with these aspects of medical genetics.
The Prevalence of Genetically Based Disease and Defect
The frequency of genetic disease and defects and of specific genetic morbid predispositions was presented by Tage Kemp, Director of the Institute for Human Genetics in Denmark. The prevalence is

2. Stable equilibrium due to (a) recurrent mutation, or (b) advantage of the heterozygote
3. Unstable equilibrium (a) in connection with disadvantage of the heterozygote and (b) in certain types of social selection.

Dr. J. Bogdan of Rumania took exception to all these conclusions. He held that progressive biology has demonstrated that the development of the individual is determined not by a hypothetical combination of genes but by the conditions of development, that the base of heredity is constituted by the type of metabolism, which in turn can be influenced by the environment, that the so-called pathological heredity determined by a morbid gene is an erroneous conception. The evidence offered for this position, particularly that concerning vegetative hybridization, was held by Lerner and other discussants to run counter to the experience of modern biology. It was felt that the free intercharge of ideas among scientists of all countries should help to clear up such misconceptions.

1. Neutral Equilibrium (a) The principle discovered in 1908, independently by Hardy and Weinberg, is the classical example of neutral equilibrium. It arises when there is random mating (panmixia) and if no genotype has any selective advantage, expressed either in terms of fecundity or in vitality, over any other genotype. Gene frequency changes which can take place by chance (drift) remain permanent. Within large groups this effect is insignificant, but differences originally produced by lack of homogeneity in small parent populations can remain for long periods. All estimates of gene frequencies made by serologists are based upon the assumption of random mating and absence of natural selection. The fact that good agreement exists between observation and theory in such calculations suggests that the genes con-

cerned are in a state not far from equi-

The Mechanism of Gene Frequency Alterations
Changes in gene frequency, both due to chance and to natural selection, are likely to be continually proceeding. The mechanism was discussed by Penrose.
It is reasonable to assume that any hereditary trait which comes under observation is due to a gene whose frequency is not changing very rapidly. Unless a gene were nearly in equilibrium, it would not have survived to be observed. Hence, in order to understand the nature of gene frequency alterations in natural populations, the conditions of genie equilibrium must be

librium.
(b) Deviations from random mating do not disturb the gene frequency provided that all genotypes are equally fit. Thus, neutral equilibrium is compatible with both assortative mating and inbreeding. These processes, so long as they last, increase the proportion of homozygotes at the expense of heterozygotes. The opposite processes of dissortation and outbreeding have the converse effect. There is outbreeding when two previously isolated populations mingle, or in cases of migration, but the gene frequency in the total human

likely to survive and changing the fitness of better ones. Obvious examples of improved fitness pertain to sugar diabetes with the discovery of insulin or to eye defects with the invention of optical and surgical remedies. Important examples of changed fitness in a changed social environment have been adduced by Sjogren: the genetic basis for dyslexia (writing and reading difficulties) may have become subject to negative selection in literate societies while it may be neutral in illiterate ones. Similarly, certain high-grade mental deficiencies imply a rather moderate social handicap in non-industrialized communities but may become seriously disadvantageous in industrial systems. In Sjogren's striking phraseology "these forms of oligophrenia--without any genetic change or any change in the clinical picture having taken place-- have acquired an increased malignancy." Considering differential fertility, this social malignancy may actually imply increased reproductive fitness. The meeting was not charged with value judgments and hence did not express opinions on whether a relative increase in such genotypes was desirable.
Selection may be directed against or in favor of heterozygotes. Dependent on how widespread positive selection is as compared to negative selection for heterozygotes, the genetic consequences of intercrossing of formerly separated human groups will be very different.
Nachtsheim presented rates of mutation for various pathological genes, ranging from lXlO2 to 1.2X10"8- It is likely that such rates of spontaneous mutation will remain more constant than intensities of selection. This will lead to slow changes in the frequencies and distributions of genes. In particular, there will be an increase in the proportion of those genes involved in diseases and abnormalities whose origin by mutation is not sufficiently counterbalanced by selection. This increase in pathological genes is particularly likely because of the long-range effects of reduced selection due

to the saving of lives by therapeutic measures. Artificial increases of potentially unfavorable genes are also bound to occur because of the widespread use of mutagenic radiations of medicine and industry, not to speak of war.
Formerly, geographically or sociologically separated populations and subpopulations -- so-called isolates -- reproduced within themselves. They became genetically different from one another as the result of selective forces or of chance.
The break-up of isolates due to better transportation and other factors leads to a scattering of clusters of like genes over the population at large. One consequence of this is, at least temporarily, a decrease of homozygotes, thus reducing the number of individuals homozygous for deleterious recessive genes. This reduction, however, will not take place with traits which depend on recessives with relatively high frequency or on dominant genes.
The reduction in deleterious homozygotes will often shield from negative selection those genes which become carried increasingly in healthy heterozygotes. Very slowly, mutation will fill up the new population with the shielded gene until the proportion of homozygotes rises to the former level.
The loss of adaptive gene combinations by isolate breaking is difficult to evaluate. The future seems likely to bring a large scale redistribution of genes by the interbreeding of diverse populations. Our present knowledge is too incomplete to foretell the consequences of such intermingling. Many geneticists feel that the result will not be harmful. Others are hesitant to adopt such a view so long as it has no basis in objective studies. The increased independence of modern man from formerly restrictive environmental agents may often --but perhaps not always--mean that no loss of adaptiveness is involved.
The elimination of morbid mutations can be achieved more efficiently by birth selection than by death selection; and this does not necessarily imply an authoritarian

abridgement of the freedom of action of the individual. Present frequencies and distribution of human genes are the result partly of processes beyond the control of man, and partly of man's voluntary actions and inactions. In an increasing manner, future frequencies and distributions will be predictable on the basis of human activities. This will mean increased responsibility since whatever we do or omit doing has its definite inescapable consequences.
The Need For Objective Data and Critical Research
There was general agreement that the only way to follow and control and study the whole body of pathologic genes in a population, "our load of mutations," is through a permanent systematic and thorough medico-genetic registration, a recording or reporting system, comprising all the patients in the population who are afflicted with a serious hereditary condition and also their families. This view was stressed by Leon, Evang, Kemp and others.
Such an epidemiological, genetic-hygienic control can be established in districts, regions or countries where the civilization has developed to a certain stage. The public health system and social care must be well-organized. Hospitals and other institutions for diseased and defective as well as the public care system must have attained a certain standard.
By means of such a genetic-hygienic registration we can follow the hereditary diseases in a population. We can check on their behavior. We can ascertain whether they decrease or increase in frequency and form an estimate as to whether the genetichygienic measures are carried through in the right way. Ultimately we can limit their prevalence.
Thorough instruction in human genetics, especially genetic pathology, ought to be included in the drriculum of medical schools.
There is need to break down the barriers

between disciplines, as pointed out by Lacroix, Aubenque and Kirk. International action is needed to standardize or at least to clarify definitions and terms. "Psychosis" for example is, as we know, not only a medical but certainly also a social diagnosis. Confusion will undoubtely arise unless great care is taken in defining terms.
In regard to nearly every aspect of human genetics, the nature-nurture problems are with us. Their solution, specific for each trait, is of prime importance to reaching conclusions on the distribution of genes in the population. Studies of maternal age and birth order throw light on these problems, as shown by McKeown. The review of twin studies by Gedda emphasizes the importance of twins as most valuable material for the evaluation of the hereditary and environmental components of an unlimited range of traits. There should be a world-wide search for the largely untapped reservoirs of identical twins reared apart. More work should be done in co-twin control research and with the "twin-family method," as well as in studies of foster children and orphans.
These conclusions on the importance of twin studies in the field of psychogenetics and psychosomatics meet with the expectation of the animal psychologists, as reported by Scott and Fuller, that the development of methods of measuring basic emotional and physiological differences at the earliest possible point in development is basic to an understanding of present and future distributions of human genes.
If, as seems likely, knowledge of human genetics increases as rapidly in the next ten years as in the years since the war, studies in the genetic qualities of populations can be expected to play a constantly increasing role in advancing human welfare. We may close with the words of Sauvy; "The sciences of demography and human genetics share a common ground. Their union can be exceedingly fruitful for the future of the human race."
