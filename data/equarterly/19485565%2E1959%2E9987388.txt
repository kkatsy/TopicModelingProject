T».HE QUESTION OF GENE DISPERSION a n d
the related concept of isolation by distance are relevant to a number of genetical problems. Application of the theories to human populations is at the initial stage, but authors like Book, Cavalli Sforza, Freire-Maia, Morton, Spuhler, Sutter and others have already made important contributions to the subject.
I wish to present some preliminary data pertinent to the population of the Parish of Ovanaker, which is located in middle-east Sweden and had, in 1944, 8000 inhabitants, in an area of 520 square kilometers, much of it covered by forest. Ovanaker is mostly a rural community, but some industrial activity has developed in recent years. It has good communications and no geographical barriers.

cent of marriages were such in the period 1900-1944. The rate of marriages with neither partner born in loco remains constant. (Table 1)

No significant difference as to the sex of the local partner is observed in the first period, while in the second the husband is significantly more often the local partner. (Table 2)

In the period 1900-1944 population size steadily increased and migration rates indicate that family size rather than immigration contributed to the increase.
Partition of marriages according to the birthplace of partners provides a better estimate of population mobility than crude migration rates. In the period 1850-1899, 62 per cent of marriages contracted in Ovanaker were between people born in the parish, while only 42 per

The geographical distance between birthplaces of partners was obtained by taking road distance in kilometers from church to church in the various parishes. Distances within Ovanaker were arbitrarily considered as zero.

Figure 1 shows the location of the birthplaces and the number of mates born outside Ovanaker who have been married to persons born in Ovanaker in the period 1900-1944.

The distribution of these distances up to 200 km. has been analyzed. The earlier period did not provide large enough figures for an efficient analysis.
Figure 2 shows the number of marriages as a function of distance. The points are the observations and the line is the fitted regression line.
If the number of marriages is related to the population size at the various distances, the factor of population density is formally taken into account. This is shown in Figure 3, where / is now the ratio of number of marriages to the population size for each distance group around Ovanaker. The curve has approximately the same shape as before,

but the best fit has been obtained by giving to d the exponent 1/5.
I am inclined not to assign much weight to these curve-fitting exercises. It is enough to note at this stage that the distributions are not normal but have a clear leptokurtic tendency. Several types of gene dispersion have been shown to be leptokurtic, as recently stressed by Bateman. Sutter has found, studying the distribution of distance in a French human population, the same type of distribution I have observed.
Sex and age of the partners should be taken into account and their effect on the distributions accounted for. This aspect of the analysis is still in progress, but I can anticipate that there is a significant heterogeneity within distances as to the

sex of the local partner. A rough analysis of the relationship between age at marriage and distance has shown that the two parameters are probably not independent, but there is, at least for men, a positive correlation between age and distance.
The incidence of first-cousin marriages is 0.57 per cent of the marriages contracted in Ovanaker for the period 19001944. A special registration is not required for cousin marriage in Sweden; this estimate was obtained by collecting information concerning parents and grandparents of the index couple from the parish books. In doing this I obtained at the same time information on the birthplaces of the partners in three directly related generations.
The distance between these birthplaces has also been obtained. This material produces an opportunity to analyze directly the distance which separates the birthplaces of three generations. For the time being, I have analyzed only the distributions of the distance within the three generations.
Figure 4 shows the cumulative per cent distribution at various distances for the three generations. Some 74 per cent of marriages are between partners born in Ovanaker in the first generation, but 55 per cent in the third. The trend is the same at the different distances. Means and variances of distance between partners for the three generations are set out in Table 3. The variance increases from 4700 to 8600 kilometers from the first to the third generation. This would mean that the size of the neighborhood has increased, or, if you prefer, that the isolate has been broken down.
In conclusion, the analysis of the dis-

I am indebted to Prof. J. A. Book for his valuable advice.

tributions of distance separating birthplaces of partners of marriages may provide us with an indirect estimate of the genetical homogeneity of the population under study. We should of course remember that different sampling techniques give us information on different aspects of theproblem. Asshown before, it should also be possible to account for some of the complicating factors like sex and age differentials. As shown by Malecot, analysis of distance gives estimates of the coefficient of relationship, and at thesame time, of effective population size andmutation pressure.
