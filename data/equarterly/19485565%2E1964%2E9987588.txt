APPRAISALS OF CIVILIZED MAN AND SAVAGE

Two recently published papers offer an opportunity for summarizing general appraisals of the mental and physical qualifications of United States youth based upon military examinations, in contrast with medicoanthropological notes on a small sample of young adult male South American Indians still living in a stone-age culture. While neither paper contains a genetic analysis, it is believed that both are sufficiently reliable and objective to warrant attention. While no eugenical implication is intended in the summaries, the contrasts between the two populations are clearly provocative of thought.
A Supplement to Health of the Army, Results of the Examination of Youths for Military Service, 1963, published by the Office of the Surgeon General, U. S. Army, May 1964, indicates that less than two-thirds of American youths would qualify for military service under presently prevailing standards. The percentage distribution of qualification in the next column is presented from B. D. Karpinos, Qualification of American Youths for Military Service, Medical Statistics Division, OTSG, Department of the Army, 1962, p. 26.
With the higher standards of 1963 "it may be expected that an over-all evaluation would indicate that around 38-40 percent of them would be unable to qualify medically, mentally and morally for military service. (The combined 1963 disqualification rate for draftees was 56.1 percent)," (p. 26).

data. They pertain only to draftees and applicants for enlistment, excluding the youths in the various reserve groups, R.O.T.C, National Guard, and others for whom no comparable data are available. Furthermore, considerable numbers are disqualified for military service by local draft boards prior to the examinations at the Armed Forces Examining Stations (AFES) on which these data are based. Quoting from page 26 of the above reference: "These limitations of the data have been overcome reliably in obtaining overall evaluations on a nationwide basis. However, such adjustments could not be accomplished on a State basis."
A pilot study of a small isolate chosen for having received minimal influences from "civilization" presents a sharply contrasted picture. "Studies on the Xavante Indians of the Brazilian Mato Grosso" in the American Journal of Human Genetics for March 1964, 16: 52-140, by J. V. Neel, et al., includes the

results of medicophysical examinations of 78 persons. "The general impression of the men was of exuberant health and vitality. They were erect in carriage, deep-chested, and very well muscled, with a notable absence of adiposity. . . . By contrast the women, although in apparent good health and nutrition when young, gave an impression of early aging. . . ." (p. 110). While the sample was far too small to warrant frequency estimates--although large in relation to the population size--it is noted that a single case of dubfoot and one alleged case of mental defect, which could not be confirmed, are the only entities mentioned specifically outside of cases of infectious disease or its aftermath. Examinations of the jaws and teeth revealed not one case of malocclusion; only two cases of anterior crowding of the teeth, both slight; and remarkable rarity of obvious tooth decay. Blood pressures tended to be low and pulse rates, slow.
Most noteworthy and perhaps of greatest objectivity was the high level of visual acuity. Of the 13 males aged 15 to 30 who were tested, not one scored below 20/20, and twelve scored 20/15 or better. The Snellen "Illiterate E" chart was used at 20 feet, without mydriatic. While males responded satisfactorily to testing, females appeared confused and easily distracted. Following are the complete results in Snellen notation of the 46 persons tested (Table 28):

Reading between the lines of this paper, it would seem that very few if indeed any of the Indian youths would fail to pass current military medicophysical examinations were it not for cultural barriers, particularly that of language.
To digress briefly into another section of this study of the Xavante Indians, it may interest readers to note that they practice polygamous marriage, with the number of wives limited only by the husband's capacity to support them, an institution which should produce eugenic results quite automatically. Of the 37 married men in the village, 16 had two or more wives and had fathered 65 of the 89 children; i.e., 43% of the married men had fathered 73% of the children. From the anthropological section of the study one forms the impression that the Indians' socioeconomic setup might be conducive to a fairly efficient operational positive eugenics. The chief is elected at a relatively young age by general suffrage among adult males as the "best" man in the village (loosely translating the Xavante adjective of description of their leader) based upon his all-around proven prowess and qualities of leadership, not only in hunting and warfare but also in council and other services to the group. The present chief with five wives had fathered 23 of the 89 children. This ratio is not held as typical of Brazilian Indians or any other group of primitive people, but it was confirmed in substance by a second field trip to the Xavantes in 1964 which has not yet been reported, according to private communication from the senior author.
