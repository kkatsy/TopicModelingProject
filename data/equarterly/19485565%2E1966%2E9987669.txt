Sterilization is being advocated in India on grounds of its effectiveness and cheapness. Another ground for the support is that it is a once-and-for-all method, and an operation performed after the birth of three children would tend to reduce an average of three more births in the remaining fertile period of a couple. As such, it has been calculated by Gopalaswamy (1962) that sterilization operations performed at the rate of 5 per 1,000 population per annum (or 2.2 million for the 1961 Indian population) for 10 years would reduce birth rate "by 12 points." It is proposed to go into these calculations and to find out the number of sterilizations which will be required to bring about a given decline in birth rate.
EFFECT OF STERILIZATION ON
BIRTH- RATE UNDER
STATIC CONDITIONS
If age-specific fertility rates found by Jain (1964) in Punjab in 1961 are applied to the 1961 married females of India, a birth rate of 42.04 is obtained. If it is assumed that the population of India remains fixed at the 1961 level of

438 million and the birth rate at 42.04 per 1,000 so that 18,424,577 children are born annually, and if it is further assumed that through sterilizations 100,000 husbands or wives are removed from the currently married and reproductive section of the population, there will be a 0.046 point reduction in the birth rate per annum, or 0.23 point reduction in five years. Even when 100,000 sterilizations are performed annually for 10 to 15 years, birth rate will decline by only 0.38 point by the end of 10 years, and by 0.46 point by the end of 15 years (Table 1). The calculations have been made on the assumption that the age and sex distribution of the population as found in the 1961 census remains unchanged over the period under study. The proportion of the sterilized males in different age groups is the same as found by Dandekar (1963) in Maharashtra State. The age-specific fertility rates that have been applied are those found by Jain for Punjab in 1961. It is thus clear that the effect of 100,000 annual operations on birth rate is likely to be marginal.

a program of vasectomizing the husbands of all the married women of ages 28-32 (by age 28 females have an average of 3.2 live births) within a period of five years, an average of 2.8 million operations will have to be performed each year. This is because there were 14.2 million currently married females of ages 28-32 in India in 1961. If 2.8 million operations are performed annually for a period of 10 years and if it is assumed that the population size remains fixed at the 1961 level of 438 million and that the age and sex composition of the population does not change, although the birth rate is 42 and death rate 20, there will be an 11-point decline in the birth rate if the proportion of those sterilized by age is the same as found by Dandekar in Maharashtra. If however, all the 2.8-- million operations are performed among currently married females of age 28, when they will have an average of 3.2 live births, or among their husbands, the decline in birth rate will be 14 points after the end of the tenth year. Under static assumptions, our calculations are close to those of Gopalaswamy. Needless to say, the assumption regarding fixed population size over time is unrealistic and greatly exaggerates the performance of sterilization. If population size and age composition are allowed to change according to the population projections as given by the Expert Committee on Population, 28 million operations

performed in 10 years will bring about only 5.5 points decline in birth rate compared with 11 points under static conditions (Table 2).

ON BIRTH-RATE UNDER
DYNAMIC CONDITIONS
Calculations in Table 2 have been made on the assumption that the female age at marriage and the proportions currently married in different ages would be the same as found in the 1961 census and that the females would be exposed to age-specific fertility rates as found by Jain in Punjab in 1961. Average difference in the ages of husband and wife has been taken to be five years, and the proportion of sterilization in males of different ages has been taken to be the same as found by Dandekar in Maharashtra. The first year has been taken as 1961 and the population for that year, 438 million. The total population in the sixth, eleventh, and sixteenth years has been taken to be 491.54, 554.67, and 625.16 million, respectively. The k population figures have been taken from those calculated by the Expert Committee on Population. Their calculations are based on the assumption that expectation of life at birth of 47.5 years in 1961 would increase at the rate of 0.75 year annually up to 1966 and later, at 0.50 year annually. The general fertility rate of 189 has been assumed to decline only

after 1971 and by 10 per cent during 1971-1976 (Indian Pop. Bull., 1961).
The results may appear a little strange, but it is to be appreciated that under a dynamic situation the population of the reproductive ages will continue to grow, but the absolute size of sterilization operations will remain fixed at 2.8 million per annum. Consequently, while 3% females of the reproductive ages will be sterilized in 1961, the percentage of such women in 1966 and 1971 would be only 2.8 and 2.5, respectively. This is because the number of currently married females in reproductive ages that in 1961 was 92.5 million is likely to increase to 101 million in 1966-1967 and to 113 million in 1970-1971. Thus, while during the decade 1961-1971, the number of currently married females in reproductive ages will increase by about 21.5 million, only 28 million couples will cease reproducing due to sterilizations. As such, the net reduction in the number of currently married females due to sterilization will be only 6.5 million.
Table 3 gives a synoptic view of the number of sterilizations which will have to be performed if a given decline in

birth rate is to be brought about during the stated number of years. It has been assumed that the program will start in the year 1966. The calculations are based on the assumption that the 1961 age-specific fertility rates found in Punjab and the proportions of currently married females by age obtained in the 1961 census remain unchanged. The projected population figures are those prepared by the Expert Committee on Population, and given earlier. The age schedule of those being sterilized is assumed to be the same as found in Maharashtra by Dandekar.
If all married women aged 30 or their husbands are sterilized each year, the load of sterilizations in 1961 will be 2.8 million; and this figure will have to be increased annually by 2.5%, the rate at which the population of India is currently growing. The consequent decline in birth rate in different years will be as given in Table 4. The calculations have been made on the basis of single year age data obtained from the 1961 census and age-specific fertility rates for all women obtained in Poona district by Dandekar (1953).
There is another way of looking at this problem. Supposing the Government of India wants to bring down birth and death rates to 16 by 1991 and the anticipated path of birth and death

rates during the intervening periods is as given in Table 5, then the projected population will be 485.6 million in 1966 and about 657 million in 1991. If it is assumed that the proposed decline in the birth rate is to be achieved only through male or female sterilizations, the number of sterilizations which will have to be preformed during different periods are given in Table 6.
Thus, the required number of the sterilizations will increase from an average of 4 million in 1961-1966 to slightly above 10 million during 19861991. If only females are to be sterilized, all the currently married females of the

reproductive ages above age 42.5 would have to be sterilized in 1961. In 1991, however, all such females beyond age 22 would have to be sterilized. The percentage of sterilized females to those in reproductive ages would increase from 1 in 1961 to 67 in 1991 (Table 7).
From the foregoing, it can be said that the problem of population control in India cannot be solved through sterilizations alone, not only because the problem is colossal and at present seems beyond the limits of feasibility, but also because sterilization is unlikely to become popular among young couples. Besides, it is irreversible and does not seem to gain the confidence of the people, particularly in areas where infant and child mortality is quite high. The role of sterilization, thus, appears to be limited

SUMMARY
Until 1958 sterilization was not officially accepted as a method of population control in India. However, recently the Indian Government has started laying special emphasis on this method on the grounds of its effectiveness and cheapness. It has been pointed out by Gopalaswamy that sterilization operations performed at the rate of 5 per 1,000 population per annum for 10 years would reduce birth rate by 12 points. Our calculations show that the decline will be by 11 points under the assumptions made by Gopalaswamy, when the population of India remains fixed over time. If this stationary condition is removed and the calculations are made on the basis of the projected population as given by the Expert Committee on Population, it is found that 28 million operations performed in 10 years will bring down birth rate by only 5.5 points.
Calculations show that if birth rate is to be reduced from 40 to 25 in a period of 10 years, roughly 6 million sterilization operations will have to be performed each year. If, however, the period is extended to 15 years, the annual number of operations required would be 5.5 million. If all married women aged 30 years or their husbands are sterilized every year, the load of sterilizations in

1961 would be 2.8 million, and this number will have to be increased annually by 2.5%. This will bring about a 30% decline in birth rate in 15 years. Calculations also show that if the Government wants to bring down birth and death rates to 16 by 1991, roughly 4 million sterilizations will have to be performed annually during 1961-1966. The number of annual operations will increase to 10 million during 1986-1991. In other words, while all the currently married females of the reproductive age above 42.5 or their husbands will have to be sterilized in 1961, all those above age 22 will have to be operated upon in 1991. This indicates that the Government cannot rely on sterilizations alone, as the number of operations which will have to be performed each year appear beyond the limit of feasibility.
