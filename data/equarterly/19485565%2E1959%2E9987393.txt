CURRENT MATING AND FERTILITY PATTERNS AND THEIR DEMOGRAPHIC SIGNIFICANCE

CLYDE V. RISER
Milbank Memorial Fund

PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF PAPER
The purpose of this paper is to describe recent trends in, and current patterns of, mating and fertility in modern Western countries. Those responsible for planning this Conference apparently felt that a paper on this topic might provide something of a norm or benchmark by which to judge the findings of the subsequent papers on the mating and fertility behavior of persons with various types of psychiatric problems.
Inasmuch as the existing data on fertility of these special groups are restricted largely to the more modernized countries, the present paper will also be so restricted. Thus the paper is not concerned with the high and uncontrolled fertility of the underdeveloped countries. More specifically it will be concerned mainly with the experience of the United States, Canada, several countries of Europe, and Australia. The source ma-

terials are mainly from the United Nations and the United States government agencies (8-15 incl.).
MATING
We shall, for present purposes, regard mating as synonymous with marriage. In Western societies probably most of the mating is within marriage. It is acknowledged that according to studies by Kinsey and others premarital and extra-marital mating are not uncommon. According to the National Office of Vital Statistics about one-fifth of the live births among nonwhites in the United States are illegitimate (12, Table AR). In certain Scandinavian countries apparently a rather considerable proportion of first births are premaritally conceived even though they are legitimized by marriage.
It is also acknowledged that there may be some relationship, both selective and

determinative, between certain types of mental illness and extra-marital mating. However, the writer knows of no adequate data on this question.
TRENDS OF MARRIAGE RATES
Figure 1 depicts trends in crude marriage rates in selected industrialized countries since 1921. It will be noted that throughout the whole period considered the rates for the United States are relatively high and those for Ireland are conspicuously low. Among the factors contributing to the relatively high marriage rate in the United States may be a somewhat younger age distribution, the relatively high proportions rural.

and the relatively high proportions that are nonwhite. Also, to a minor extent the relatively high rate of divorce itself augments the marriage rate of the United States.
As for Ireland, abstention from marriage and late age at marriage apparently are forms of population control that the Irish have imposed upon themselves. Unforgettably subjected to the potato famine and the ensuing misery of the 1850's, the Irish nevertheless apparently have remained firm in their religious opposition to contraception. At first, migration to the United States provided some relief from population pressure. When this outlet became closed, the

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:25 08 December 2015

Malthusian factor of moral restraint apparently became the accepted means of population control. Some of the unmarried youngsters migrate to England and other countries for temporary or permanent residence. Of those that remain at home a few marry at young ages. Probably many mature men and women who are more or less formally engaged live with their aged parents and wait around until the circumstances are such that they can be married. Probably for many the opportunities and even the inclinations fade with age.
As for trends, most of the Western countries experienced declines in the marriage rate during the late twenties and early thirties. In the United States the crude marriage rate dropped to 7.9 per 1,000 population in 1932, the lowest point on record. Apparently during this period thousands of marriages were cancelled or postponed because of the economic depression. No job, no money, no marriage.
Following its low point of 1932, the marriage rate climbed slowly with the gradual economic recovery. The threat of war in 1938, and the European outbreak of war in 1939 stimulated defense spending and the creation of new jobs in the United States. Defense production was stepped up further during the "arsenal of democracy" era, and it became an all-out effort when we entered the war in December, 1941.
Besides the economic factors, the entrance of the United States into the war stimulated marriages and births directly. Young men sometimes sought marriage and parenthood to avoid or to defer conscription into military service. The monthly marriage rates indicate a rush to the altar right after Pearl Harbor. Ten months after Pearl Harbor there was a

67
sharp peak in the monthly birth rate. On an annual basis, the marriage rate
in the United States reached a wartime peak of 13.1 in 1942. It dropped to 11.0 in 1944 when a large number of soldiers were overseas. With the ending of the war in 1945 and the ensuing demobilization, the year 1946 marked the highest marriage rate on record in this country, 16.4 marriages per 1,000 population. The European countries exhibited peaks in marriage rates in 1946, but none equaled the magnitude of that in the United States. Even Ireland, neutral in the war, exhibited a slight rise in 1946. In most of the countries considered the trend ol the marriage rate has been downward since 1946. In 1957, the marriage rates varied from 5 in Ireland to 8.9 in the United States.
ACE AT MARRIAGE
There has been a marked trend toward younger marriages in recent years. Computations based upon annual registration data may sometimes conceal or minimize this trend because of counteracting increases in remarriages and because of the aging of the population. For this reason, students frequently use census data on marital status by age for computing average or median ages at marriage, as in Figure 2.
For the countries depicted in Figure 2, the median age at marriage around 1950 was lowest in the United States and highest in Ireland. The median age at marriage for women in the United States was 21.3 years in 1930 and 20.2 years in 1950, a decline of 1.1 years. In Ireland the median was 27.7 in 1941 and 26.0 in 1951, a decline of 1.7 years.
The trends and differentials in marriage patterns are depicted much more strikingly in Figure 3 which is concerned with percentages ever married among

women 20-24 years old in the various countries for the approximate years 1940 and 1950. Thus in 1940 only slightly over half ofthe women 20-24 years old in the United States had ever married. In 1950, the proportion was slightly over

two-thirds. Other data indicate that the percentage was 71 for 1957 (2, p. 45). In Ireland only about 12 percent of the women 20-24 were married in 1941, and the corresponding percentage for 1951 was about 18.

CONTRACEPTIVE PRACTICE
The practice of contraception is widely prevalent in most of the modernized countries. It has implemented the longstanding decline in size of completed family. It is the means by which couples plan or attempt to plan the number and

spacing oftheir children, and as such it is an important aspect of the patterns of mating and fertility in modern countries. Among the couples in the Indianapolis Study about 89 per cent reported at least some experience with contraception when they were interviewed in 1941.

70 Eugenics Quarterly

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:25 08 December 2015

Virtually all, about 98 per cent, of the couples classified as "relatively fecund" reported some previous use of contraception (16).
A study "Growth of American Families" conducted jointly by the Survey Research Center of the University of Michigan and the Scripps Foundation for Research in Population Problems was carried out in 1955 among some 2,700 white couples with wife 18-39 years of age. This study collected data on number of children born to date, total number of children desired, and past contraceptive practice. The findings of this study are now being published in a book by Whelp ton, Freedman, and Campbell
In a recent report of some of the materials Dr. Ronald Freedman stated, "The great majority of American couples in the childbearing years report that they have used contraception already or that they intend to do so in the future. The exceptions are mainly couples who have no need or little need for contraception because they are subfecund. Among fecund couples in our sample, 83 per cent reported that they had already used contraception and an additional 7 per cent intended to do so after one or more pregnancies" (2). Some of the nonusers were recently married couples who wanted one or two children soon after marriage, and others just had not gotten around to starting preventive measures.
About 19 per cent of the couples in the Growth of American Families study had Completely Planned fertility in that they had no pregnancies except those that were deliberately planned by stopping contraception in order to conceive. About 66 per cent had Partially Planned fertility. ("Some of their pregnancies

may have been planned, some may have been accidents, or contraception may never have been used, but none of these couples have had unwanted children.") About 13 per cent wereExcess-Fertility couples in that the last pregnancy was not wanted by either the wife or husband.
A companion study of the "Growth of American Families" is the Study of the Future Fertility of Two-Child Families being carried out under the technical direction of the Office of Population Research, Princeton University and under the sponsorship of the Milbank Memorial Fund. It is a partially longitudinal study of 1,165 native-white couples in seven metropolitan areas of the United States who had their second child in September, 1956. These couples were visited for the first time in the spring of 1957. They will be revisited in the spring of 1960.
According to data secured from the first visits, about 59 per cent of the couples were classified as "successful planners" in that they had planned the second child. The proportion of successful planners varied by religion of the couple. It was lowest (48-50 per cent) for the Catholics and for the mixed marriages solemnized by a priest. It was highest (83 per cent) for the Jewish couples, and intermediate (58 per cent) for Protestant couples (6).
CRUDE BIRTH RATE
The trends of crude birth rates for selected modern countries are presented in Figure 4. For most of the countries and years considered, Canada had the highest birth rate. Since 1949 the order has been, Canada, United States, Netherlands, Ireland, France, and (interchangeably in lowest position) England and Wales, and Sweden.

United States women are relatively low in comparison with those of other countries. Except for Netherlands the postwar baby boom apparently brought little increase to fertility rates of women 35 years of age and over.
Figure 6 brings together the data for women of successive ages of the childbearing span for the various countries and for the period 1950-1954. This points up again that the fertility of the United States women in comparison with that in other countries stands highest at ages under 25 but relatively low at ages 3044. The fertility of Netherlands women stands lowest at ages under 25 and highest at ages 30-44. The fertility rate for Canadian women surpasses that of the other countries considered at ages 25-29; it stands second to the United States at younger ages and second to Netherlands at older ages.
MARITAL FERTILITY RATES
The fertility rates shown up to this point are based upon births during given calendar years as they have related to total populations and to total female populations of given age regardless of marriage.
Another conventional type of fertility rate is one based upon total number of children ever born per married woman of given age. Whereas the annual fertility rates are usually based upon the registrations of vital statistics, the cumulative fertility rates are usually derived from census inquiries on number of children ever born.
Although Ireland is characterized by conspicuously low proportions married and by late age at marriage, her marital fertility rates are conspicuously high. This is brought out in Figure 7 showing number of children ever born per 100 marriages existing at census dates (circa

73
1946-1950), by duration of marriage. The rates are conspicuously higher in Ireland than any other country represented for women married five years or more. Netherlands stands in second place. The rates for Australia and the United States are in middling position, and those for Switzerland, France, and Great Britain are relatively low.
Caution must be used in comparing Figures 6 and 7 because of differences in type of rate. There is the strong suggestion, however, that (a) the excess of the general fertility rate for women 15-24 years old in the United States over that for Ireland is due entirely to higher proportions married, (b) the excess of the same United States rate over that for England and Wales arises from higher proportions married and higher marital fertility and (c) the relatively low general fertility rates of United States women 35-44 years are due to low marital fertility rates in the United States at these ages.
United Nations data on cumulative fertility rates for married women in several countries, by duration of marriage and age of wife at marriage, points, up the inherently high fertility of the women of Ireland who do marry at young ages (15, p. 65).
MARITAL FERTILITY IN
THE UNITED STATES SINCE 1910
The United States Census data on number of children ever born reveal some interesting aspects of fertility trends since 1910. In Figure 8 the conventional age-specific cumulative fertility rates for all women and for ever-married women are shown for 1910, 1940, 1950, and 1957. Several points stand out:
1. Among the ever-married women the rates for 1910 are highest at all ages and those for 1940 are lowest at ages

ages in thesame Census. Thus, in 1957 the fertility of women 35-39 years old actually surpassed that of women 40-44 years old,and the average fertility rate for thelatter group, in turn, was higher than that for women 45-49 years old. This is a clear demonstration of increase in average size of completed family.
Figure 9, based upon the same data, shows the percentage of women of specified age group bearing specified numbers of children in 1910, 1940, 1950, and 1957. This throws considerable light on the source of theincreases in fertility since 1940. There were marked decreases in theproportion of women bearing no child and bearing only one child. On the other hand, there were marked increases in the proportions bearing two and three children. The increase in

average number ofchildren has been due not to a return of thevery large family of the 1910 era but to increases in proportions bearing two and three children.
COHORT FERTILITY
In assaying fertility trends, it is important to keep in mind the difference between "period" and "cohort" fertility. Figures 8 and 9 relate to period fertility, i.e., average number of children ever born among women of specific ages at specific periods.
Figure 10 adds another dimension and charts the fertility histories of specific cohorts of ever-married women, i.e., women born in a given period. The term "cohort" simply implies that the women are "followed through" forobservation regarding events of pertinence such as their fertility. Figure 10,based

Thus by noting the small circles, we see that the low point in thedownward trend in the average number of children ever born by ages 35-39 was reached by women born during 1905-1910, i.e., it occurred around 1945; more recent cohorts have exhibited increases. The low point in fertility by age 30-34 was reached by women born during 1910-1915. This occurred around 1945.
DIFFERENTIALS BY COLOR, RELIGION
AND RESIDENCE
There has been a remarkable increase since 1940 in thefertility ofyoung nonwhite married couples inurban areasof the United States. In 1940, the urban

nonwhite married women in this country were characterized by lower average fertility than urban whites of similar age. This was due almost entirely to higher proportions childless. Thefertility of mothers tended to behigher among nonwhites than whites. Similar differences by color still obtained in 1950 among women 25 years of age and over. Among the urban married women under 25years old, however, the nonwhites surpassed the whites ofcomparable residence with respect to average number of children and fell below the whites with respect to proportions childless. This increase in fertility of young nonwhites hasbeen attributed, inpart, to a cleanup of venereal diseases since 1940. Other factors

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:25 08 December 2015

are the general improvement in the economic, social and civic status of nonwhites in this country since 1940 (4).
Regional differences in fertility still exist in the United States as in other modern countries. In general the more industrialized and the more urbanized the area, the lower the fertility rates tend to be. In the United States the fertility rates tend to be relatively low in the Northeast and Pacific areas, intermediate in the North Central areas, and high in the South and Mountain areas. The high fertility of the South is due partly to the high proportion of nonwhites as well as to the relatively high proportions rural in the population.
The tendency for fertility to be lowest for urban people, intermediate for ruralnonfarm people, and highest for the rural-farm still persists but not nearly so sharply as in previous times. Not only is the urban-rural differential in fertility narrowing, but the proportion of people classified as rural is decreasing. It was 60 per cent in 1900 and 41 per cent by comparable definition in 1950. In 1910, the farm population contributed about one-third of the total in the United States. In 1955, it comprised less than 14 per cent. There has been a sharp increase in proportion of people living in large metropolitan areas. In 1950, slightly over one-fourth of the people of this country lived in the twelve urbanized areas of one million or more population (7).
With regard to the three major religious groups in the Western countries, fertility rates tend to be highest among the Catholics, intermediate among the Protestants, and lowest among the Jews. For instance, the average number of children ever born per 1,000 ever-married women 45 years old and over in the

79
United States in 1957 was 3,056 for the Catholics, 2,753 for the Protestants, and 2,218 for the Jews (10, p. 41).
Some of the mating and fertility characteristics may be summarized for specific countries. As indicated in Table 1, the United States is characterized by highest marriage rates, youngest age at marriage, highest proportion ever married among women under 25 years old, and youngest age structure of the evermarried women among the countries considered. Largely because of the high proportions married, women 15-19 and 20-24 outrank those of the other countries considered in general fertility rates. However, the fertility rates for women 30 years of age and over are relatively low.
Because of the relatively high fertility at young ages and relatively low fertility at older ages the proportion of annual births attributable to women under 25 is higher for the United States than for the other countries considered. In 1954 the proportion was 46 per cent for the United States as compared with 19 per cent for the Netherlands and possibly an even lower proportion for Ireland. In the remaining countries the percentages ranged from 26 to 38 per cent.
The Netherlands also has relatively high crude marriage and birth rates but a relatively late age at marriage. Therefore among countries represented in Figures 5 and 6, which incidentally do not include Ireland, the Netherlands is characterized by lowest general fertility rates at young ages and highest at older ages.
Canada is distinctive for her highest crude birth rates during the past decade. She has a relatively high marriage rate and stands next to the United States with respect to high proportions married

among women 20-24 years old. She stands highest in general fertility rates at ages 25-29. By standing next to the United States in high fertility at young ages and next to Netherlands with respect to high fertility at older ages, Canada is distinctive in her exhibition of relatively high fertility at all ages.
Ireland is characterized by lowest marriage rate, oldest ages at marriage, lowest proportions married among women under 25. On the other hand, the fertility rates of the women who do get married probably outrank those of any other country in the Western world. Hence her crude birth rate and general fertility rates tend to be in middling position despite the disadvantage of late age at marriage.
England and Wales and Sweden, in contrast to Canada, exhibit relatively low fertility levels at all ages. They are in middling position with respect to age at marriage. The remaining countries tend to fall in middling positions with respect to most characteristics considered but some of them also display certain distinctive features. It may also be noted that whereas the relatively high fertility of several countries might truly be ascribed partially to the influence ot given religions or ethnic groups it is also apparent that the fertility patterns of Catholics in Ireland, for instance, are tremendously different from those of France.

DEMOGRAPHIC SIGNIFICANCE
The chief demographic consequence of the mating and fertility patterns has been the large increase in population. The increase in population during the past two decades has been a world-wide trend. However, in underdeveloped countries the increase has stemmed largely from decreases in mortality. In the

modernized countries therecent increase in population has stemmed mainly from increases in fertility.
A second demographic consequence is that of change in agecomposition. Since increased births were the source of the increased population in the modernized countries the increase hasbeen conspicuous in the young age group. In 1940 there were 45.3 million people under 20 years old in the United States. In 1957, the number was about 64 million. This was an increase of about 40 per cent. At the same time thepopulation was becoming older. The number of persons 60 years of age and over increased by 58 per cent from about 13.7 million to 21.7 million. This increase in the number

and proportion of aged persons and the implications for future prevalence of mental illness andinstitutional care and treatment areperhaps of special concern to the mental hygienist. The general change in age composition in the United States is shown by the age pyramids for 1940 and 1957 (Figure 11).
The demographic consequences could be discussed at further length. The changing geographic and urban-rural distribution, and the burgeoning of suburbs andhuge housing developments, are not unrelated to the postwar increases in size, agestructure, and to marriage and reproduction trends.
The previously mentioned narrowing of urban-mral differentials in fertility

is but one aspect of a general disappearance of urban-rural contrasts as we once knew them. "With the coming of the radio and television, the surfacing of roads, the popularization of the automobile, the increasing tendency for rural people to go to the city to work and for the urban people to come to rural areas to live, the urban and rural people and the people in different regions and classes are becoming more alike in many ways other than their fertility behavior (3).
However, whereas there is a trend toward uniformity of fertility patterns within the United States and probably also within other countries, we have also noted that the modern Western countries present a variety of patterns of mating and fertility. Thus if I wassupposed to describe a norm or benchmark, I have failed to deliver. The norms and benchmarks must be found in the specific countries. More specifically, if one desires to study the relation of fertility to given psychiatric conditions, he will do well to follow the time-tested method of using as a control group people that resemble the subjects as much as possible in all things except the existence of the psychiatric condition.
