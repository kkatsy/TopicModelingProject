MEETINGS AND REGENT PUBLICATIONS

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:26 08 December 2015

GROWTH IN LIVING SYSTEMS (Edited by M. X. Zarrow et al): Basic Books, Inc., New York, 1961, 759 pp., $15.00.
Proceedings of an international symposium on molecular biology held at Purdue University in 1960 in which more than thirty biologists participated. F. H. C. Crick and M. B. Hoagland discuss the relationship between the nucleic acids and the proteins, a basic theme of the symposium. The material is divided into three parts: I. Molecules, Viruses, and Bacteria; II. Cells, Tissues, and Organisms; III. Plant Growth and Plant Communities.
CAUSES OF MENTAL DISORDER--A Re-
view of Epidemiological Knowledge, 1959: Milbank Memorial Fund, New York, 1961, 383 pp., $3.50 (paper). Eight authorities take stock of our present state of knowledge about causes of mental disorders. These proceedins of a round table held in 1959 under the sponsorship of the Milbank Memorial Fund form the eighth of the Fund's publications in the field of mental health.
The volume begins very logically with a discussion of genetic factors by the Scandinavian geneticist Dr. Jan A. Book. He examines the evidence for genetic factors in inborn errors of metabolism and schizophrenia and manic-depression. Proof of genetic etiology is impossible without a method that identifies an almost one-to-one relationship with the causative gene mutation. Repetition of traditional family and population surveys will never enable the geneticist to prove his case definitely, concludes Dr. Book. He does not find a genetic ap-

proach to the neuroses meaningful at the present time.
Other papers deal with damage to the fetus and the brain, the family, social structures and changes, and cultures as causative of mental disorders.
DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ON TROPICAL
AFRICA: Frank Lorimer. Boston University Press, Boston, 1961, 207 pp., $2.50 (paper). POPULATION IN AFRICA (Edited by Frank Lorimer and Mark Karp): Boston University Press, Boston, 1961, 88 pp., $1.00 (paper).
These publications of the African Studies Program at Boston University in cooperation with the Population Council are of special concern because of the increasing impact of the African nations on the world scene. Frank Lorimer headed up an investigation of sources of demographic information in tropical Africa, visiting many of the statistical offices and research centers. "Demographic Information in Tropical Africa" reviews the present status of demographic information. Dr. Lorimer found that demographic statistics in Africa have undergone a significant transformation during the postwar period and that useful statistical information now exists for most of these countries. New methods, international cooperation, and other advances have pushed along the field of demographic statistics in Africa.
Dr. Lorimer also acted as an organizer of several meetings on African population problems. "Population in Africa" is the report of one such meeting. This population discussion was held at Boston University in cooperation with the Pop-

ulation Council, and Dudley Kirk, Demographic Director of the Council, acted as chairman.
DAL CENSIMENTO DELL'UNITA AL CENSI-
MENTI DEL CENTENARIO--Un Secólo di Vita della Statistica italiano, 1861-1961. Istituto Centrale di Statistica, Rome, 1961, 205 pp. (paper).
A survey of a century of progress in Italian census statistics, from 1861 to 1961, put out by the Central Institute of Statistics in Rome, founded in 1926. This demographic survey is also a history of the first century of an Italy reunited in a single national state. In 1861 the density of population in Italy was 87 per kilometer; now it is 170. The census is traced from Count Cavour, the organizer of official Italian statistics, through the postwar development of the Central Institute of Statistics. Illustrations commencing with the census in Judea under Caesar Augustus and ending with the electric computer of today add to the attractiveness of this very readable little history.
PHENYLKETONURIA: Willard R. Centerwall and Siegrid A. Centerwall, U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Children's Bureau, 1961, 28 pp., 15çf (paper).
A nontechnical pamphlet from the Children's Bureau for physicians and public health workers which describes the recent revolutionary strides in the treatment of the inborn error of metabolism resulting in the disease, phenylketonuria. The genetics of this disease is explained and its clincal course. Testing methods for detection are given. Diets which have been successful in preventing or favorably modifying the mental retardation stemming from the disease are listed.

RELATIVISM AND THE STUDY OF MAN
(Edited by Helmut Schoeck and James W. Wiggins) : D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc., Princeton and New York, 1961, 259 pp., $6.50.
A symposium on problems of relativism as related to disciplines studying man. The papers by Conway Zirkle on Human Evolution and Relativism and by Leonard Carmichael on Scientific Psychology of Human Nature are relevant to eugenics.
TOWARD A SCIENCE OF MANKIND: Laura Thompson. McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, 1961, 276 pp., $5.95.
A "science of mankind' 'is not only possible but imminent, according to the author of this book. An anthropologist from the University of North Carolina, she declares that mountains of facts are piling up but attempts to translate them into general principles are lagging. Her hypothesis described here is based on empirical field research and clinical testings in a number of culturally diverse communities.
