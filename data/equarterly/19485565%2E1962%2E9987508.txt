IHERE HAVE BEEN many fears and numerous predictions that our national intelligence level is declining because the larger the family size, the lower the average intelligence of the children in it. Several negative correlations between intelligence and family size for large samples have been found to be rather consistently between r = --0.20 and r = -- 0.30. Studies confined to particular social classes demonstrate smaller but still negative correlations. It has been predicted that the average IQ of the population should drop from two to four points per generation because of this negative relationship between the size of the family and the intelligence of the children therein. (Reviewed by Anastasi, 1956, 1959.)

One of the most likely explanations comes from the work of Willoughby and Coogan (1940). They investigated a group of high school graduates 12 years after graduation. Their population was divided into twoequal parts, a higher IQ group and a lower IQ half. The married graduates of the lower IQ group had a larger average family size than those of the married members of the higher IQ group. However, if the unmarried graduates of both groups were also included, the higher IQ group produced more children per person than the lower IQ group. The married members of the higher IQ group had smaller families, but almost all of these graduates married, while the family size was larger in the lower IQ group, but fewer members of it married.

The predicted decrease in IQ has not materialized in tests of similar groups of children separated by a time span of ten to 20 years. Instead, the investigations of Cattell (1951) and Scottish Council for Research in Education (1949) show no decrease, or even a slight increase, in average IQ of the recently tested children compared with earlier samples. There is thus a striking inconsistency between the predictions and the observations. A number of proposals purporting to resolve this paradox have been advanced.
* Now at the Department of Zoology, Michigan State University, East Lansing.

The study of Willoughby and Coogan has been criticized because of its small sample size and because any sample of high school graduates will have a higher average IQ than the general population. Nonetheless, their study anticipates the resolution of the paradox presented by the negative correlation between intelligence and family size followed by the failure of the general level of intelligence to decline as predicted.
PROCEDURE
The original data to be reported here are from a massive study carried out at the Minnesota State School and Hospital and by the Dight Institute for Human

Genetics. The work has been supported by the Minnesota Human Genetics League for the last 12 years with practically all its income being utilized for this purpose. Generous support has also been provided by the National Institute of Mental Health, contract M-1431, and from a number of individual benefactors.
A careful study of the genealogies and social characteristics of the families of over 500 patients at the Minnesota State School and Hospital for the mentally retarded was made almost 50 years ago. A subsample of 300 of these families, which excluded 200 with epileptic involvement, was selected for a follow-up study. The large family constellations which resulted from inclusion of all descendants of the grandparents of the original 300 patients include something in the neighborhood of 85,000 persons. It will be readily apparent that most of this huge population were not closely related to the original patients and many were related only by marriage. IQ values have been obtained for everyone possible. They were obtained from the widespread school testing programs within the states where the family members had attended school. Many of them were obtained from many Departments of Public Institutions and Welfare. We are greatly indebted to the hundreds of teachers, officials, and others who provided our essential intelligence quotients. We are also greatly indebted to Mrs. Vivian Phillips, Mrs. Gayle Feller, and Mrs. Magnhild Goodman for technical assistance during the past several years. We are well aware that the accuracy and value of a single intelligence quotient may be slight. However, in a large collection of IQ values the errors in the individual tests should largely cancel out, and the striking differences to be presented are certainly not the result of

testing errors. Families for whom IQ values were ob-
tained for both parents and for one or more of their children were selected from our large pool of data. These families were in most cases a generation or two removed from the original patients. The distribution of the IQ's of the sample of parents and children seems to be very similar to that of a normal population.
RESULTS
Included in this study are 1,016 mothers, an equal number of fathers and 2,039 children, a total of 4,071 persons with known IQ values. The average IQ of the mothers is 103.22 ± 0.45, SD 14.40 ± 0.45; the average IQ of the fathers is 100.72 ±0.48, SD 15.39 ± 0.34. The mean IQ of the parents is statistically significantly lower than the mean IQ of the children, female 107.67 ± 0.50, SD 15.82±0.35; and male 104.96±0.49, SD 15.61 db 0.34. The mothers' average IQ is 2.5 points higher than the IQ of the fathers and the female offspring average 2.7 points higher than the male offspring. The cause for the difference in average IQ between the sexes is not known.
The difference between the IQ's of the parents and the children would be reduced if age at testing were taken into consideration. The mean age of the parents at testing was 14.24 years, while the mean age of the children was 8.65 years. A least squares line was fitted to the mean IQ's of the children separated according to the age at the time of testing. The least squares line drops from an IQ near 110 at the age of five years to 97.5 at the age of 18. If the age of the children were equated via the least squares line to the mean age of the parents at testing, the average IQ of the children would be reduced and would be between the average of the father and the mother

(Figure 1). The average IQ of the children would be reduced by approximately five points.
The relationship between relatives has been measured in various ways, one of which is by use of the correlation coefficient. The siblings in our study have an r equal to 0.52±0.02 which is within the range of other studies previously done and near the theoretical value of 0.50 predicted by Galton. The correlation of the parents with the children equals 0.43 ± 0.02 for father-child and 0.45 ± 0.02 for mother-child. The difference between the correlations is not statistically significant.
The husband-wife correlation for the present study is 0.33 ± 0.03 which is lower than the other investigations of this type. The other studies were done on parents who were tested when they were adults. The tests used may not always have been suitable for adults and they were given after the parents had been living together for a number of years. The IQ values in this study were taken before marriage, in most cases while the individuals were of school age, and may give a sharper picture of the genetic component of assortive mating.
The relation of the IQ's of the parents to the size of the family they produced is shown in Table 1. The average IQ of the parents appears to be similar for families of sizes one to five. There is an appreciable drop in IQ for larger family size for both the IQ's of the mothers and the fathers. The correlation of the IQ of the mother with the family size is --0.11 ±0.03. This is statistically significantly different from 0 at the one per cent level. The correlation for the IQ of the father with the size of the family is --0.08 ± 0.03. The correlation of the father is statistically significantly different from 0 at the 5% level. The parents

show a negative correlation with family size that has been seen before when the IQ's of the children were compared.
The investigations in the past on family size and IQ of the children have yielded correlation coefficients of --0.20 to -- 0.30. The present study has a correlation of --0.30 ± 0.02 for the same comparison. It can be seen in Table 2 that the mean IQ's of the children are similar for the family sizes of one to five and then drop significantly from sizes six to ten. The variation in average IQ of the groups of children parallels that of the parents.
The regression toward the mean IQ of the children at the ends of the intelligence quotient distribution is of considerable interest. The average IQ of the

two parents is first calculated and then they are grouped in the ranges of 70 and below and so on up. These are given in the left hand column in Table 3. The next column gives the average value for the averages of the pairs of parents in each range. The third column gives the average IQ for the children produced by the parents in the range at the left. The differences between the average IQ's of the parents and their offspring are statistically significant at the 1% level in all cases except the 131 and above range where the sample is rather small. However, when the average IQ of the children is reduced by five points to compensate for the age at testing bias, the deviation between parents and children of the 131 and above group joins the others as highly statistically significant.
In Table 4 the reproductive rates of the parents are compared (illegitimate births are also included). The two extreme groups have a higher reproductive potential than the rest of the population. The high reproductive rate of the low IQ group has been reported many times. The high rate for the group with an average IQ above 131 IQ points is not normally observed, and is perhaps a recent development.
In order to eliminate one source of error, the brothers and sisters (who had no children) of the present parental population were added. Past studies of the relationship between IQ and reproduction have almost always been faulty and open to bias because of the failure to include these siblings who never reproduced. The siblings of the parents of the present study for whom IQ's were available were added in an attempt to overcome this obvious shortcoming of the previous investigations.
The distribution of the IQ's of the siblings of the parents show no striking dif-

ference in shape from the distribution of the parental IQ's, except for the greater proportion of lower IQ siblings.
The reproductive rates of all the married persons in the parental generation are tabulated in Table 5. The largest average families are still in the lowest IQ group.
The IQ distributions for the unmarried brothers, age 40 or over, and the unmarried sisters, age 35 or over, are shown in Table 6. Also included is the proportion of the siblings who marry for each IQ range. The highest proportion of unmarried siblings is in the group below IQ's of 55. The marital rate is almost equal from the IQ of 71 and up.
Table 7 shows the average number of children born to each IQ range when single brothers and sisters are included. It shows that the lowest IQ group, because of the small number who reproduce, have no more children per person than do the higher IQ groups. If the table is divided at the IQ level of 100, the lower IQ half produced 2.2 children per person while the higher IQ individuals averaged 2.3 children per person.
In Figure 2 the IQ distribution of the parents and the number of the children per family can be seen for three IQ ranges, parents who have IQ's 70 or below, 101-110, and 131 or above. The graph shows that the lower IQ parents include a high proportion who never produce offspring or only one. The middle range of IQ's shows a high peak at two children and forms a bell shaped curve. The high IQ group has an equal proportion of children in the two and three child families, and the distribution is skewed in the direction of the larger families.
This means that, in spite of the negative correlation of --0.30 ± 0.02 between the number of children in the family

The high reproduction of the lowerIQ group whohave children isbalancedby the lack ofoffspring ofthelow IQ group who never marry. As a result, the mean IQ ofthe population should remain relatively static from one generation to the next, or atleast not drop rapidly. Hopefully, it might rise slightly.
SUMMARY

cord with the large negative correlation (--0.S0) between intelligence and the number of children inthe family.
The explanation of the paradox is that when the single or non-reproductivesiblings of the parents are included the negative correlation disappears. The higher reproductive rate of those in the lower IQgroups whoare parents is offset by the larger proportion oftheirsiblings who never marry or who fail to
