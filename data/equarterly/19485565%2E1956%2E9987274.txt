Introduction
/EMOGRAPHERS HAVE LONG RECOGNIZED
the importance of religious composition to any study of population. In particular, knowledge of the religious composition of populations in large metropolitan areas containing large numbers of "minority" groups appears to be essential for a meaningful interpretation of population trends. The present study deals with the population of a school-district area in Brooklyn which is composed of large numbers of Catholic and Jewish inhabitants.
This is a middle-class area characterized by large multiple-dwelling, postwar housing averaging about $25.00 per room per month rental. There are also a substantial number of small private homes, almost all of postwar construction. The entire area is residential, and commercial pursuits are confined to rental and service enterprises.
The sample used for the present study is composed of the entire senior class of the academic year 1953-54 in the new postwar junior high school serving the area.

This class numbered 410 white students of about 14 years of age and equally divided between males and females. Approximately 60 per cent of the sample were classified Jewish and 40 per cent as Christian. Approximately three-fourths of the Christian sample were Catholic; the remaining quarter were Protestant. From records and interviews data regarding size of family, I.Q. score, and occupation of father were obtained for each student.
Average Size of Family and I.Q. of Respondent
The average number of children in the family was found to be 3.53 for Christians and 2.29 for Jews. The families were classified according to the I.Q. score of the student and the average numbers of children by I.Q. class and religion were presented in Table I.1 The differences between the two religious groups are quite evident. Perhaps of greater interest are the differences between the I.Q. classes within each religious group. From past studies one would expect an inverse relationship between I.Q. and size of family.2 Such a relationship is

clear relationship can be found within the Jewish sample. There is virtually no difference in the average size of Jewish families among the various I.Q. classes. Furthermore, the much higher standard deviations within each Christian I.Q.class indicate a large amount of variation in family size within each I.Q. class as well, a condition not found within the Jewish group.
