A FURTHER NOTE ON EVOLUTION AND SCHIZOPHRENIA

The comments by Kuttner and Lorincz (1966, p. 355) on the Huxley et al. (1964) hypothesis relating the high incidence of schizophrenia to a genetic morphism raise important questions concerning the possible evolution of such a trait. They
find it hard to visualize what benefits an organism obtains by subnormal sensitivity to some or many natural physiological substances in either a primitive or civilized environment. For every hypothetical advantage, it is easy to imagine an equally significant disability.
I should like to suggest the possibility that the response of schizophrenics to stresses noted by Huxley et al. (1964), may be quite unrelated to whatever genetic factors exist in the etiology of schizophrenia. Hruza and Poupa (1964, p. 947) report that animals stressed in the NCD (a standard physical stress apparatus for laboratory animals) display cross resistance to other types of physical stress:
A considerable degree of induced resistance to NCD trauma, to endotoxin shock, and to hemolysis after burns (cross resistance) can be evoked by repeated traumatization in the NCD.
Since until recently a large number of schizophrenic patients were subjected to electro-shock and insulin shock therapy, it is possible that their resistance to other physical stress is an artifact of treatment rather than the effect of some gene. A

comparison should certainly be made between shock treated and untreated schizophrenics to see whether or not the genetic morphism hypothesis can be verified. With the increased use of chemotherapy and the decreased employment of shock therapy in many hospitals recent hospital statistics might well fail to show the expected correspondence between schizophrenia and resistance to trauma. In addition since sociological stress might also be implicated in cross resistance (it certainly plays a part in rat populations) it might be useful to compare hospitalized schizophrenics with other hospital populations as well as with the inmates of penal institutions.
In addition to the possible strictures on the genetic hypothesis offered above, the statistics on the world wide incidence of schizophrenia suggest another difficulty. Human populations have a wide and ecologically varied distribution. For those situations in which a genetic morphism is suggested one would also expect to find frequency variations of the trait in question. In addition one would expect to find these variations to be based, at least in part, on social and behavioral differences which effect both the penetrance and selective value of the trait. Exposure to severe burns, for example, is frequent in some societies where open liearths are common and young infants are poorly attended. New Guinea is an area in which both these phenomena are

frequently encountered. The incidence of infectious disease, which is due partially to climatic and other ecological factors and partially to cultural practices, also varies from group to group. Accidental injury and injury due towarfare arecertainly dependent on thecustoms of the populations involved. The anthropological literature is full ofreferences to different socialization patterns which should also contribute to the differential epidemiology of a disease which has been related so often to familial interaction. It is therefore surprising that the incidence of schizophrenia appears to occur at a constant rate in all populations tested. It is possible that this invariance is due to sampling errors as well as to errors of diagnosis. If the

Huxley (1964) hypothesis were correct, one would certainly hope to correlate the incidence of thegene with exposure to various types of stress in theenvironment of various populations. Theincidence and degree of penetrance should also vary with the amount of psychological stress generated by the behavioral system.
