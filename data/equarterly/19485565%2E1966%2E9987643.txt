The general absence in the United States of any information on religion in the official census and in vital statistics has been a major barrier to the analysis of religious differentials in fertility and mortality. To fill this void for fertility, particularly as evidence suggests that religion has become an increasingly important factor in influencing the number of children born per family, special surveys have been undertaken (Freedman et al., 1959; Westoff et al., 1961, 1963). Our knowledge of religious differentials in mortality remains much more limited.
This report, based on data for a single metropolitan community, explores the patterns of Jewish mortality and survival and attempts to ascertain the ways, if any, in which these patterns differ from those of the general population. The observances of health measures and cleanliness prescribed by traditional Judaism, coupled with the higher-than-average socioeconomic status of the Jewish population would lead one to expect the Jewish group to be characterized by lower mortality rates and longer survival. Yet, such an hypothesized difference may be weakened or totally eliminated as a result of both the general improvement in health standards and the rise in the socioeconomic status of the population at large. By comparing the mortality patterns of the Jewish and the total population, this analysis may suggest the extent to which the religious dimension

remains a key variable in accounting for mortality differentials on the American scene.
Whereas the analysis of fertility lends itself to a survey approach, this is not equally true of the analysis of mortality, since survey statistics may be biased in favor of those deceased persons who left behind them a family unit to be included in a sample; deceased persons who had lived alone would most likely not be identified in such a survey.1 As a result, any comprehensive analysis of mortality must necessarily begin with records that provide the maximum opportunity for identifying all deceased persons regardless of their household and family status at the time of death. Official death certificates provide the best means for achieving this goal. Yet, because vital statistics records do not contain information on religion, indirect clues to the religious identification of the deceased must be used before death certificate information can be used for the analysis of religious differentials in mortality.
Among the clues that have served this purpose in the several studies completed to date are the place of burial of the deceased and the particular funeral directors who handled the funeral. However, the value of these particular sources of information probably varies by religious identification, largely reflecting the different practices with respect to burial in cemeteries identified as Jewish, Catho-

lie, Protestant, or nonsectarian. A similar problem would extend to the question of whether funerals are largely handled by funeral directors of the same religious denomination as the deceased person. Recent studies in New York City (Seidman et al., 1962) and in St. Louis (Gorwitz, 1962) indicate, for example, that a very high percentage of Jewish funerals are handled by a restricted number of funeral directors and that practically all Jewish burials occur in a Jewish cemetery. In the case of the New York study, however, which was restricted to identifying religious affiliation on the basis of cemetery of interment, over 20% of the total deaths had to be regarded as of unspecified religions because the bodies were either cremated, interred out of town, or buried in the city cemetery. These unspecified deaths were allocated to each religious group in the same proportion as the "specified" deaths based on known place of burial. The necessity to do so weakens the value of this particular study for an analysis of the patterns of Jewish mortality. The use by the St. Louis study of information on both the funeral director and the place of burial enhances the chances that the resulting statistics correctly reflect total Jewish deaths.
In both the New York and the St. Louis studies, another serious limitation was the absence of information on the Jewish population whose deaths were being analyzed. The New York study used the least squares method to estimate the Jewish and non-Jewish white populations and death rates by age, sex, and socioeconomic class. The St. Louis study made no attempt to estimate the Jewish population by age and used only overall estimates of the Jewish population living in the St. Louis area as the basis for computing its crude death rates. In the

absence of exact information on the population structure of the Jewish community, any analysis of the number of deaths and the age composition of the deceased has limited value for measuring differentials. Since age composition in particular is a major variable in affecting the overall level of mortality, information on age-specific mortality is essential if the mortality experience of the Jewish segment and the total population are to be compared in a meaningful way.
Within the limits imposed by its restricted information, the St. Louis study, based on 1,478 Jewish deaths and 25 Jewish stillbirths during 1955, 1956, and 1957, pointed to several major conclusions. Overall, it found that the Jewish mortality rate was approximately 14% lower than that of the resident white population of the area. A much higher percentage of all deaths was concentrated between the ages of 45 and 85 for the Jewish population compared to the white population. This may, however, reflect nothing more than a comparable differential in the age concentration of the total population. Whether the risk of mortality in this age range is greater for the Jewish than for the non-Jewish population cannot be ascertained in the absence of the base population statistics. This study also found that Jewish mortality rates were lower for most major causes of death. These differences were minor in the case of heart disease, cancer, and vascular lesions; but they were large in the case of accidents, pneumonia, diseases of early infancy, suicide, tuberculosis, syphilis, and alcoholism. Again, however, since the mortality rate from specific causes varies considerably by age group, such overall comparisons cannot be used conclusively to ascertain differentials with respect to cause of death. Finally, the study found that, as in the case of

50

the total death rate, the estimated Jewish infant mortality rate and stillbirth rate were substantially lower than the comparable rates in the total white population.
Although probably basing its findings on data of poorer quality with respect to the exactness of religious identification, the New York study represents an improvement over the St. Louis analysis in that an attempt was made to control for age differentials in the composition of the Jewish and non-Jewish population. Within the limits of the methods used, this study found that the male Jewish death rate was 14% below the non-Jewish death rate, holding age constant; whereas the Jewish female death rate was 4% higher than that of the nonJewish population. The New York study considered socioeconomic class as a major variable in addition to age and sex. It found that the Jewish death rates were much lower than non-Jewish death rates for persons of the same age, sex, and socioeconomic class in the younger age groups; but this advantage is diminished and even reversed in certain of the older age groups. Within the Jewish group, it found the death rate 20% lower in the high and middle socioeconomic class than in the low socioeconomic class. Although direct comparison of the St. Louis and the New York findings is not possible, in general the conclusions point in the same direction; that is, an overall lower mortality for Jews.
Unlike the United States, Canada includes religion as one of the variables on which information is collected as part of its official census and vital registration systems. Utilizing materials from these sources, Mortimer Spiegelman (1948) analyzed the longevity of Jews in Canada for the period 1940-1942. Comparative life tables for the Jewish population of

Canada and for the general population showed that life expectancy for Jewish males was 4.6 years greater than for males in the general population and that the difference for females of 3.6 years also favored the Jews. Similar to the more recent New York study, the Canadian analysis found that the differentials favoring the Jews decreased with advancing age and that the expectation of life for the Jews and for the total Canadian population was equal at age 25 for females and at age 35 for males. This pattern reflected the fact that Jewish infants in Canada started life with an infant mortality rate only 40% as great as that of the general population and that this advantage, although decreasing in magnitude, persisted through childhood, adolescence, and early maturity. Beyond age 50, the Jews began to be characterized by the higher mortality rates. As Spiegelman suggests, the reasons for these age variations between Jews and the general population require a detailed investigation of the causes of death in the two groups as well as controls for differences in place of residence, socioeconomic status, nativity, and marital status.
A limitation of the Canadian analysis stems from the fact that deaths among Jews in Canada for the period of this study were distributed by sex, but not by age. The latter distribution had to be estimated on the basis of records available for the province of Ontario. There is no reason to believe, however, that this procedure seriously altered the resulting findings. Spiegelman concluded his analysis by suggesting that the longevity and mortality characteristics of the relatively small Jewish population of Canada may be indicative of what might be found for the millions of Jews in the United States, for whom such information is not available. The later studies of the Jew-

ish communities of St. Louis and New York and the current analysis of mortality patterns of Jews of Greater Providence give support to his assumption.
SOURCES OF DATA
The various limitations inherent in the small number of studies conducted to date on the patterns of Jewish mortality point to the desirability of carrying this research further as either different sets of information or more comprehensive data become available. A unique body of data available for Providence, Rhode Island, affords such a new opportunity to examine the patterns of Jewish mortality and to ascertain the differentials, if any, between Jewish survival patterns and those of the total white population.
In the late spring of 1963 a population survey was undertaken of the Jewish population of Greater Providence, including the cities of Providence and Pawtucket and the suburban areas of Cranston, East Providence, Barrington, and Warwick.2 The sample, selected to obtain information on 25% of the total Jewish population, was drawn from master lists maintained by the central coordinating committees of the Jewish communities of Providence and Pawtucket. Before using these lists for sampling purposes, their comprehensiveness was checked by obtaining membership rosters from almost every Jewish religious, social, and secular organization in the area. The more than 20,000 names, some of which were duplicates, obtained in this way were checked against the master lists. Only 213 units had to be added to the 5,783 households already on file. As an added test on its accuracy, and particularly to test whether the master

list was biased in favor of Jews affiliated with Jewish organizations, the names of all persons identified as Jewish in several independent general community studies conducted in the Providence area were cross-checked in the master file. This resulted in the location of 97.5% of Jewish households, suggesting that the master files provided a very complete enumeration of the universe of Jewish families. Based on this level of coverage, the 5,996 units included in the corrected master list provided the basis for selecting the sample of households to be interviewed.
As one added check to insure coverage of unaffiliated, new residents in the community, the interview schedule itself contained a question asking the respondents for names and addresses of newcomers to the Jewish community. The 260 names elicited by such a canvass were also double-checked in the master file. Of these, all but 44 were listed. These 44 units, almost all of them very recent in-migrants, were added to the original 25% sample of 1,559 selected from the master files. Therefore, 1,603 households constituted the total sample size. But of this number, 47 proved ineligible, leaving 1,556 units to be interviewed. A response rate of 91.3 yielded a final sample of 1,420 households.
Evaluation through data: available in city directories of the occupation and family status characteristics of the refusals and those not contacted suggests that omission of these units did not bias the overall results. A correction for these omissions was made by randomly selecting, from within each geographic area, a total of 136 cases from among the completed interviews, thereby increasing the number of sample units to be analyzed to the original total of 1,556 eligible units. As a final step, appropriate weights, applied to the data from each

subarea to insure proper representation in the combined results for Greater Providence, yielded the universe of 5,934 household units containing 19,595 persons.
Among the many variables on which information was collected in the survey are the age and sex characteristics of the individual members of each household unit. Using this information, the age and sex distribution of the Jewish population of Greater Providence is presented in Table 1 with comparable figures for the total white population of the same area. The differential distribution by age of Jews and of the total white population follows the same pattern for both males and females. At both extremes of the age pyramid, the proportion of Jews is less than the proportion of the total population, but particularly for the under-five age group. This large difference reflects the lower fertility of the Jews. At the other end of the age hierarchy, the differences are considerably smaller, with approximately 1% fewer Jews in the age groups 65 and over compared to the total white population. A striking differential between the Jewish and the total white popula-

tion is in the 25- to 34-year age group. This group consists of persons who were born during the depression when the birth rate in the United States was at its lowest point; the considerably lower proportion of Jews in this age group reflects the sharper Jewish reduction in fertility during the depression years compared to that of the non-Jewish population. Finally, it will be noted that for each sex group the proportion of Jewish population between the ages of 35 and 64 is greater than that for the total white population. This differential may reflect the somewhat heavier concentration of immigrants among the Jewish population than in the general population.
The Jewish community of Greater Providence is so structured that almost all deaths occurring to Jews are handled by a single funeral director. Moreover, practically all Jewish deceased are buried in the single Jewish cemetery serving the area encompassed by this study. Finally, even the very small number of Jewish deceased who may be cremated or buried in non-Jewish cemeteries are generally serviced through the one Jewish funeral director. All of the evidence available suggests, therefore, that reliance upon the records of the Jewish funeral director provides almost 100% coverage for all Jewish deaths occurring in Greater Providence or among Providence Jews who die elsewhere and are buried in Providence.
This research is based on deaths that occurred to Jewish residents of Greater Providence in the two-year period August 1, 1962-July 31, 1964, a period centered on the months during which the population census was completed. First, the names of all deceased for this two-year period who were listed in the files of the single Jewish funeral director were obtained. These were then checked through the files of the Rhode Island

Division of Vital Statistics. From the original death certificates, information was abstracted on the sex and age of the deceased person and the cause of death. The resulting mortality statistics by age and sex, encompassing all Jewish deaths in the two-year period under investigation, were related to the statistics from the population census in order to obtain both age- and sex-specific death rates for the Jewish population. These data in turn have been used to construct life tables for the Jewish population of Greater Providence. To permit comparison with the mortality experience of the general population, both age- and sexspecific death rates were computed and life tables were constructed for the total white population of Rhode Island.
MORTALITY RATES
In all, 397 Jewish deaths were indentified for the two-year period under investigation, giving a death rate of 10.1 per 1,000 Jewish persons. This was slightly below the crude death rates for the total white population of Rhode Island, which for the period 1959-1961 was 10.3. As the data in Table 2 show, however, the pattern of differentials was not uniform for males and females. The Jewish male death rate of 10.6 per 1,000 was below that of the total male white population, whereas the 9.7 death rate for Jewish females was slightly above that of the total white female population.
To ascertain whether these differentials stem from the differences in age structure of the Jewish and the total populations, age-standardized death rates have been computed for the Jewish group. These rates show what the overall Jewish rate would be if the Jewish population had the same age structure as the total population but retained its own age-specific death rates. For both

males and females, standardizing the death rates for age raises the Jewish death rates, that of the males becoming 11.0 and that of the females, 11.2. For the males the standardized death rate differs little from that of the total male white population, thereby suggesting that the mortality experience of Jewish males varies little from that of the total population. For the females, however, standardizing for age accentuates the differential between the Jewish and the total death rates, raising the former to 11.2 compared to a 9.4 rates for the total population.
Examination of the age-specific rates presented in Table 2 shows that at early ages for both males and females the mortality rates of the total population are higher than those of the Jewish group. This is particularly true of the infant mortality rate--that is, deaths to children under one year of age--where the rate for Jewish males is less than half of that of the total white male population and the rate for Jewish females is only 60% as high as that of the total whites. Since infant mortality is gener-

ally regarded as greatly affected by socioeconomic factors, the considerably lower rates for the Jewish population may reflect the relatively better socioeconomic status of the Jewish population in the larger community.8 For males, the lower rates favoring the Jewish group continue through the 55- to 64-year age group; for females, with minor exception, the lower rates persist through the 45- to 54year age group. In all higher age groups, the Jewish rates are higher than those of the total population, and the differential tends to become increasingly great with older age. For the oldest group, for example, the Jewish rates are over 50% greater than those of the total white population for both males and females.
This changing pattern of age differentials conforms closely to those observed in the other studies discussed earlier. Since proportionally more of the deaths occurring at early ages are due to infectious and communicable diseases, whereas more of those occurring in old age result from chronic illnesses, these differentials suggest that the rate of deaths due to communicable disease is lower among Jews. As a result, more Jews survive to old age,when the chronic diseases assume increased importance as a cause of death. As Spiegelman (1948) suggests, the higher Jewish death rates at older ages may arise from the effect, in later life, of their low mortality in early life. The better living conditions that may account for the lower rates of Jewish mortality in infancy, childhood, and through middle age may result in proportionally more physically impaired persons living until the upper ages when
"The median education of Jews in Greater Providence was 11.8 years compared to a median of 9.1 years for the total population. Sixty-one per cent of all employed Jewish males were professionals and managers compared to only 20% of the total male population of Greater Providence (see Goldstein, 1964, pp. 72 and 89).

the chronic diseases take a heavier toll (Spiegelman, 1948, pp. 300-301). Later analysis of the data on cause of death will permit more detailed examination of this assumption. Before turning to these data, however, the life expectancy of Jews and of the total population will be compared.

LIFE EXPECTANCY AND SURVIVAL
EXPERIENCE
Based on the mortality experience of the Jewish population of Greater Providence in the period 1962 to 1964, the average life expectancy of Jews is 70.8 years for males and 73.4 years for females. Comparison in Table 3 of these life expectancies with those of the total white population of Rhode Island, based on mortality experience in the years 1959 to 1961,shows that Jewish males on the average could expect to live 3.3 years longer than males in the total white population. The life expectancy of Jewish females differed only minimally from that of the total white female population, being 0.2 years lower. The greater advantage that Jewish males hold in life expectancy over the total white male population compared to the absence of

such an advantage for the females corresponds to the pattern of differentials in overall death rates by sex. For the Jewish population, as for the total population, the life expectancy at birth of females exceeds that of males, but again because of the somewhat higher mortality of the females, this differential is not so great for the Jewish population as for the total population. For the latter, females can expect to live approximately 6 years longer than males, whereas for the Jewish population the differential amounts to only 2.6 years.
The more favorable life expectancy that characterizes the Jewish male population at birth persists up to age 65, although the balance in favor of the Jews diminishes with increasing age. Whereas Jewish male life expectancy at birth exceeds that of the total white population by 3.3 years, at age 15 the difference amounts to only 2.2 years; at age 45 it amounts to 1.5 years; and at age 65 the advantage turns in favor of the total white population. Thereafter the expectation of life among Jewish males continues to be lower, and the disadvantage becomes increasingly great. At age 85, Jewish males can expect to live on the average only 2.6 years longer, whereas the total white male population can expect 4.6 more years of life. The higher life expectancy of Jewish males at birth stems from the generally more favorable age-specific mortality patterns that characterize the younger age groups of the Jewish population; in turn, the higher age-specific mortality characterizing the older segments of the Jewish population accounts for the lower life expectancy that characterizes the older segments of the Jewish male group.
For females, the pattern is quite different. Jewish females begin life with a slightly lower life expectancy than the total white female population, and this

disadvantage persists throughout the life cycle. The differential remains relatively small in the early years, never exceeding one year until age 35. At,age 35, the life expectancy of Jewish females is 1.1 years below that of the total white population; this differential tends, although irregularly, to increase with advancing age, reaching 2.0 years at age 85. Jewish female life expectancy never exceeds that of the total white population, in contrast to that of the males. Although the age-specific mortality rates of Jewish females at younger ages are lower than those of the total white population, the differentials are generally not so great as those that characterize the males. At the same time, the age-specific mortality of older Jewish females exceeds that of the total white population, and the disadvantage in mortality experience of Jewish females begins at an earlier age than that of the Jewish males. Overall, this pattern of age-specific differentials in mortality experience results in lower levels of life expectancy for Jewish females both at birth and throughout the life cycle. Factors that operate to account for better survival experience on the part of Jewish females in comparison with the respective segments of the total white population are not indicated by the data available in the current analysis.
Average life expectancy at birth reflects the mortality experience of the population throughout all later stages of the life cycle. Another perspective for evaluating the survival experience of the population is to examine what proportion of the population will ;be alive by a given year of age (see Table 4). Because these data also are based · on the agespecific mortality rates, the survival experience of both Jewish males and Jewish females is more favorable than that of the total white population up to the very oldest age groups.

experience of the population for the years 1962 to 1964 persists into the future, 95.5% of all Jewish-born males will still be alive at age 45 compared to 92.4% of the total white male population; at age 65, 76.8% of the Jewish males will still be living compared to only 66.4% of the original cohorts of total white males. At this point in the age cycle, the differential between Jewish males and the total white male population is greatest. In the next category, age 75, proportionally more Jewish males are still alive, but the differential has diminished to 43.3% compared to 38.8%; and by age 85 the survival experience actually favors the total white population, with 18.2% of the total white males surviving compared to only 10.1% of the original group of Jewish males.
Reflecting their lower age-specific mortality compared to the total white female population, proportionally more Jewish females survive to age 45, 96.9% compared to 94.8%; but the differential is not so great as that which characterizes the males. At age 65, 82.2% of the Jewish females are still alive compared to 80.4% of the total white female population. Thereafter, the proportion surviv-

ing is greater for the total white females than for the Jewish females, with 23.7% of the latter still alive at age 85 compared to 19.7% of Jewish females.
For both the Jewish and the total white population, the high proportion of individuals who survive to relatively late points in the life cycle is striking. That over 90% of all Jewish-born persons will still be alive at age 55, if current mortality experience persists, and that 40% of the males and over half of the females will survive to age 75 is indicative of this significant point. These data on survival also suggest that for the Jewish population, as for the total population, the sex differential in survival experience results in a considerably higher proportion of females surviving to old age. By age 85, only 10% of the Jewish males will still be living compared to twice as many Jewish females.
In sum, the above-average mortality rates for Jews at older ages had the effect of reducing their expectation of life at somewhat younger ages for males and at all ages for females, below the average for the total white population as a whole. On the other hand, the low Jewish mortality in childhood, adolescence, and into middle age results in the Jewish population having larger proportions surviving into middle age, and for males even into the early segment of older years.
CAUSE OF DEATH
Part of the differential between the mortality rates of the Jewish population and that of the white population as a whole may stem from variations in cause of death. Since cause of death generally varies significantly by age, comparison of the mortality statistics by cause of death for the total population is quite

meaningless. Ideally, comparisons should be made in terms of both age- and sexspecific groups; the rather limited number of cases upon which this analysis of Jewish mortality is based precludes such a complete analysis, particularly for the age groups under 45, among whom the number of Jewish deaths is very small.4 In order to introduce some control, however, the cause of death analysis will be undertaken separately for persons aged 45 to 64 and for those 65 years old and over (Table 5).
For the 45- to 64-year age group Jewish mortality as a whole is well below that of the total white population, amounting to only 86 deaths per 10,000 persons compared to 116 deaths per 10,000 for the total white group.5 Yet, the distribution of the Jewish deaths by cause generally shows only minimal variation from the pattern of the population as a whole.
4 The small number of Jewish deaths in the 15 to 44 age group were concentrated in two categories: cancer and accidents. The even smaller number of deaths in the I to 14 age group were equally distributed among three categories: accidents, respiratory diseases, and disease of the digestive systems.
5 In contrast to age- and sex-specific death rates, which are expressed per 1,000 population, the cause-of-death specific rates are expressed per 10,000 population because of the smaller number of cases in particular cells.

For both Jews and total whites, heart disease represented the highest cause of death, accounting for 44% of all deaths occurring to the white population aged 45 to 64 and 52% of all deaths among Jews in this age group. For both groups, too, cancer contributed the second highest number of deaths, accounting for just over one-quarter of all deaths among the total whites and just under one-quarter of all deaths among Jews. Beyond these two major categories, no single cause of death accounted for as much as 10% of all deaths, but there were small differences in order of importance; vascular lesions and respiratory diseases were the third and fourth most important factors among the total white population, whereas suicide and diabetes ranked third and fourth among the Jews. It must be emphasized, however, that all of these accounted for small proportions of total deaths and that particularly among the Jewish population the absolute number of cases involved in deaths from diabetes and suicide were less than five in each group.
Since the overall level of Jewish mortality for the 45- to 64-year age group is only 74% as high as that of the total white population, the mortality from

specific categories of disease is also generally lower for Jews than for the total white population. However, the level of difference is not uniform, and the extent of variation from the overall differential of 74% therefore provides some insight into whether certain diseases account for a higher-than-average mortality among Jews. It must be recognized in this discussion, however, that, with the exception of suicide, the rates of mortality for specific diseases are in all instances below that of the general population. The question, therefore, is whether or not within this lower level there are meaningful differences. If 74% is used as a standard, the data suggest that the cause-specific rates of mortality of Jews are well below that of the total white population for accidents and for vascular lesions and are somewhat below the average for cancer. On the other hand, the Jewish specific rates compared to their overall rates, are above average for heart disease, for diabetes, and particularly for suicide.
For the 65-and-over age group, the overall level of mortality of Jews exceeds that of the total white population by 12%, being 720 per 10,000 population compared to 641 per 10,000 for the white population. Comparison of the percentage distribution of deaths by cause for the two groups shows some reversal in the relative importance of specific causal factors; for both groups, heart disease remains the leading cause of death, but in this oldest age group it is somewhat more important for the total white population than for Jews. Cancer remains the second leading cause of death for both groups, but in contrast to the 45- to 64-year age cohort, it accounts for proportionally more deaths among Jews than in the total white population, 18% compared to 14%. For both Jews and total whites, vascular le-

sions assume considerably more importance as a cause of death in the older population, accounting for 12% of all deaths in both groups. With the exception of the miscellaneous category, none of the others accounts for more than 5% of all deaths; in order of importance, they are diabetes, accidents, and chronic respiratory diseases for the total white population and diabetes, respiratory diseases, and accidents for the Jewish population. For both groups, the proportion of all deaths attributable to suicide declines considerably among the aged group, although the rate of death due to suicide is actually higher. On the whole, comparison of the percentage distribution of deaths by cause suggests minimal variation between Jews and total whites.
As already noted, the overall level of mortality for the 65- and-over age group is about 12% higher for Jews compared to total whites. Comparison of the Jewish and total white rates for specific causes of death shows that with the exception of the miscellaneous category, the Jewish mortality rates are consistently higher than those of the total white population; however, the rates show considerable variation. The relative difference in rates between Jews and total whites is about the same as the overall difference for accidents and for vascular lesions; they are higher for cancer, diabetes, respiratory diseases, and suicide in that order; and they are lower for heart disease, although the difference is not particularly great.
SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
The importance of religion as a variable in fertility differentials in the United States suggests the desirability of exploring whether religious differentials also characterize mortality and life expectancy. Direct measures of the impact

of particular religious practices and customs on health and survival are not measurable by exclusive reliance on information contained in death certificates. The existence or nonexistence of differentials in rates of mortality should suggest, however, the extent to which patterns of living, or possibly genetic factors, associated with membership in a particular religious group influence the life chances of a given segment of the population. To explore this question, mortality data available for one religious group, the Jewish population of the Providence, Rhode Island, metropolitan area, have been compared with those of the total white population. The analysis, based on coordinated use of official death records and information obtained from the single Jewish funeral establishment in the area, points to several major conclusions.
As judged by age-standardized death rates, the mortality of Jewish males differs minimally from that of all white males; but that of Jewish females is higher than the rate characterizing white females. On this basis the data do not support the hypothesis that the mortality of Jews is below that of the total population; but for both males and females, the Jewish age-specific rates are below those of the white population at younger ages and are higher at older ages. The differences for males tend to be sharper than for females at all ages. The reversal in the pattern of age differentials at the older ages has been noted in other studies of Jewish mortality. The lower death rates at young ages may result from the better personal care associated with the high premium placed by the Jewish religion on cleanliness and body care and the better environmental conditions resulting from the higher-thanaverage socioeconomic status held by Jews in the community as judged by

both education and occupation. They may also stem from long-continued genetic selection for resistance to the infectious diseases of urban living. The lower mortality in younger groups has led to speculation that proportionally more Jewish persons with physically impaired lives may survive until later years, when the effects of chronic disease may take higher tolls, thereby raising the Jewish age-specific death rates of older persons above those of the general population. The statistics, by cause of death, lend support to such a contention; for Jews 65 and over, the death rates from all major chronic diseases are above those of the total white population.
Comparison of life tables constructed for both Jews and total whites suggests that average life expectancy at birth favors Jewish males but shows little difference for females. The advantage in life expectancy of Jewish males declines, however, with advancing age and actually becomes less than that of all whites beyond age 65. For females, life expectancy of Jews remains' below that of total whites throughout the life cycle, and the differential tends to become increasingly higher from middle age onward.
The calculation of life expectancy at birth reflects mortality experience at all later stages of the life cycle and incorporates, therefore, the effects both of the lower Jewish rates at early ages and of the higher rates at older ages. In contrast, the proportion surviving to a particular age reflects the effects of mortality only up to that age. For this reason, the lower Jewish mortality in the childhood as well as the early and middle adult stages of the life cycle account for higher proportions of Jews surviving into middle age and, in the case of males, even into the lower range of old age.

As judged by age-specific rates, life expectancy, and survival patterns, the findings of this study show that Jewish males have a better survival experience in comparison to white males than do Jewish females in comparison to the white female population. This conforms to conclusions reached by Spiegelman (1948, pp. 299-301) in his earlier analysis of Canadian data. The factors that account for this are not, however, indicated by the data available in the current analysis. Further attention should be given to the reasons for this sex differential when more refined controls for age, sex, cause of death, socioeconomic status, and other variables can be introduced.
Finally, the analysis suggests that for Jews, as for the total white group, heart disease and cancer constitute the two major causes of death. Yet, within the 45- to 64-year age range, the death rates of Jews from these causes, as for all causes, are below those of the general population. By contrast, in the 65-andover age group, the death rates of Jews due to heart disease, cancer, and other cause of death categories considered here are above those of the aged population at large. This pattern lends weight to the speculation that the better survival patterns at earlier ages may contribute to a greater susceptibility on the part of aged Jews to the debilitating effects of the chronic diseases characteristic of old age. Full support for such an hypothesis cannot be obtained from the data of the current analysis.
In sum, this research suggests that differences exist between the age-specific death rates, life expectancy, and survival patterns of Jews and of the total white population of Greater Providence, generally more so for males than for females. Moreover, the patterns of differ-

entials observed conform closely, where comparisons are feasible, to those noted in earlier studies of New York, St. Louis, and Canada. Since these various studies cover a 25-year range, this research suggests that religious identification as a Jew continues to affect the life chances of individuals.6 Whether this is due to being a Jew as such or to other factors associated with Jewish identification, such as higher socioeconomic status, cannot be ascertained from the Providence data; the New York analysis suggested that the differences persist even when socioeconomic level is controlled (Seidman et al., 1962, pp. 263-269). Admittedly, the small number of cases on which this analysis is based and the limited geographic area covered preclude generalizations to the Jews of the United States as a whole, to say nothing of the broader question of other religious groups. The results do suggest, however, that more attention to the relation between religious identification and mortality patterns is justified and that such research may provide new insights into the demographic processes characterizing the United States.
