SEX RATIO AT BIRTH IN TERRITORIES WITH A RELATIVELY COMPLETE REGISTRATION *

The objective of this paper is to examine the correctness of the impression that the sex ratio at birth usually varies between 104 and 107 (male births per 100 female births). The discussion relates to the sex ratio of live births only. True, the sex ratio of live births is only a terminal result and is dependent on the sex ratio of conceptions and of fetal deaths. However, an examination of the long controversy on the level of the "primary" sex ratio (or the sex ratio at conception) and the reasons for its variation from the "secondary" sex ratio (or the sex ratio of live births) is rendered difficult by the nonavailability of accurate data and is outside the purview of the present discussion.
SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF THE INQUIRY
The study is restricted to the births registered during a recent ten-year period 1949-1958 for which data are available in Demographic Yearbook 1959. Data for only those territories, for which the Yearbook indicates "relatively complete" registration or at least 90% coverage of events occurring each year are considered. The United Nations estimate of the relative completeness of registration is based, however, on national reports on the subject, and admittedly, such evaluations are not necessarily of uni-

form quality. Nevertheless, the data are good enough for a broad survey.
It should be noted that the reported data, from which sex ratios at birth have been calculated, often relate to live births registered rather than occurring during a year, and the registration of events after a certain lapse of time could be biased in various ways. In a ten-year series such as has been used, the random error is reduced, but the effect of systematic biases does not decrease.
In certain countries, babies born alive but dying before registration of their births are excluded from figures of live births. In so far as neonatal and infant mortality is higher among males than females, the exclusion of live-born children dying before registration from the figures of live births may result in an underestimation of the masculinity of births. However, with the prevailing low levels of neonatal and infant mortality among most of the countries concerned, the bias introduced by such a procedure is likely to be very small.
Random Error
Before we analyze the data, it is pertinent to outline the influence of random error on reported sex ratios. Assuming that there is a "true" proportion of males among all live births, each of which is, by definition, an independent event, the actual sex ratio based on observed births will approach the true value only as the number of observed births becomes infinitely longer.

served births becomes infinitely large. The standard error of an observed sex ratio can be estimated as the standard error of the proportion "p" of male births among the total. This proportion can be taken to be binomially distributed. Table 1 below shows the 95%

sex ratio at birth--104-107 (inclusive). While the consideration of random error is relevant to all values, we shall concentrate on the deviant values that fall outside the usual range.
Of the 30 deviant values of sex ratios at birth, 23 fall below the lower limit

confidence limits for four integer values of the sex ratio at birth, in the usual range, based on different specified numbers of births. It shows that one needs a surprisingly large number of births to obtain an observation of a sex ratio at birth within a narrow confidence range. Therefore, a great deal of caution is necessary in interpreting sex ratios based on relatively small numbers of live births.
The Range of Variation of the Sex Ratio at Birth
Table 2 on pp. 134--135 shows the sex ratios and the number of observed births for the 76 territories that have been studied. As three countries, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa and the United States, report separate data for different races, the total number of values shown is 80. Several of the values are based on a small number of births and admit of a nonnegligible random error. However, 50 out of 80 values fall within the usually stated range of

of the usual range (104) and 7 exceed the upper limit of 107. Besides, 15 out of 23 values below 104 and one value above 107 are for populations with a significant component of the negroid or mixed among them. This association will be discussed presently.
For the deviant sex ratios at birth that are not associated with a significant component of negroid population, Table 3 shows the 95% confidence limits. It suggests that except in cases of Asiatics in the Union of South Africa, Chile, Hong Kong, and Aden, the random error can explain the deviation.
Late Fetal Mortality and the Sex Ratio at Birth
At this stage a reference may be made to a statement by Professor Amos H. Hawley that "as a rule, the sex ratio at birth exceeds 100 and varies inversely with the frequency of prenatal losses." Further, "where prenatal losses are low, as in the high level-of-living areas of the West, the sex ratios at birth are usually

g Data refer to Japanese nationals in Japan only. h Excluding armed forces and foreigners. 1 Births to residents of West Berlin and Federal Republic of Germany, temporarily in Federal Republic or West Berlin, respectively, are allocated to their usual place of residence. Births to alien armed forces and nonresident civilians temporarily in the area are excluded. 1 Beginning with 1953, data exclude those infants born alive after less than 28 weeks' gestation, of less than 1000 grams in weight and 35 centimeters in length, who die within 24 hours of birth.

around 105 to 106. On the other hand, in low level-of-living areas where the frequencies of prenatal losses are relatively high, sex ratios vary around 102." (Hawley, 1961). This view finds place also in a popular textbook which is widely used (Thompson and Lewis, 1965).
A verification of this view is rendered difficult by the fact that both the identification and registration of prenatal mor-

tality generally tend to be less than accurate. The available empirical information of a satisfactory standard is restricted to the data on late fetal deaths which occur after 28 weeks of gestation.
We have attempted to study these data to estimate the degree of association between the incidence of late fetal mortality and the sex ratios of live births shown in Table 2. As an index of the former, late fetal death ratios or the

birth in the negro population of the United States has not increased despite a marked fall in fetal mortality. The same appears to be true of the Jamaicans. The conclusion is obvious that the recent empirical data give at best weak support to the suggested inverse association between the sex ratio of live births and the incidence of prenatal mortality.

number of late fetal deaths per 1000 live births were calculated for 62 territories, which, according to the Demographic Yearbook, 1959, had "relatively complete" or reliable data. The period covered was the same as for the sex ratios at birth shown for the territory in Table 2. The observed range of late fetal death ratios with the minimum value of 9.2 for El Salvador and the maximum value of 65.8 for Mauritius might be rather narrow in relation to the probable higher values in the past when the mortality level was generally high.
However, the linear correlation coefficient between the late fetal death ratios and the sex ratios of live births during 1949-1958 in 62 territories is -- 0.15, which is not statistically significant at 5% level of significance. Further, as will be seen below, the sex ratio at

SEX RATIO AMONG THE NEGROID
POPULATIONS
Let us now discuss the sex ratios at birth in territories with a significant component of the negroid in their population. To place the relevant facts in sharp focus, Table 4 shows the exact percentages of population classified as
(a) "the negro, black or African" and (b) "the negro, black or African and colored or mixed" in 17 territories or groups, where they form more than onethird of the total, and where the registration is regarded as relatively complete so as to permit their inclusion in Table 2. To allow for random error, the 95% confidence limits of the observed sex ratio in each territory have also been shown in Table 4.
Rather surprisingly, only in two territories--Bahama Islands and Gambia-- does the reported sex ratio exceed 104. Six out of remaining 15 values of the sex ratio at birth could be below 104 due to the change factor or random error alone. Since one can expect about 1 out of 20 observations on the average to fall outside of the 95% confidence interval, it is quite incredible that 6 out 15 could do so because of chance factors. Of course, two of the six values are for British Guiana and Trinidad and Tobago, where a significant proportion of the population is decended from the immigrants from India. If births among these people, called East Indians, could

be excluded, both the reported sex ratios at birth and the upper limit of the confidence interval may be lower.
The obvious hypothesis is that the negroid populations might have a genetically or racially associated tendency to a somewhat lower masculinity at birth than that indicated by the usual range of 104.0-107.0, based on data for the nonnegroid populations. This hypothesis gets further support from the historical data for the United States and the West Indies.

HISTORICAL DATA FROM THE WEST
INDIES AND THE UNITED STATES
The sex ratio at birth reported above for the West Indies as a group for the period 1949-1958 is very close to that observed in some of the constituent territories over the past 40 to 70 years. Further, according to the registration records, the highest sex ratio at birth ever recorded in Jamaica has been 104.7 in 1880 and 1895. (Roberts, 1957). The ratios based on births registered over some 5 to 7 decades for Jamaica

and some other neighbouring territories are shown in Table 5.
Similar evidence is available for the nonwhite population in the U.S.A., which is predominantly negroid. The mean sex ratio of births among the negroes during 1915^8 was 102.9. (McMahan, 1951). Earlier, a study of the sex ratio at birth in the United States birth registration area during 1917-34 had concluded that "the sex ratio of colored births is consistently and markedly lower than that of births to native white parents" (Ciacco, 1938).
It is true that the difference between the negroid and nonnegroid sex ratios at birth is very small. Such a small difference could arise from some biases in registration that any result from particular attitudes or beliefs. However, the sex ratio at birth among the nonwhites in the United States and the Caribbean populations has remained below that among the whites or the non-negroid populations over a long period of time. In the United States, between 1940 and 1959, the percentage of total nonwhite registered births occurring in hospitals or receiving attention by a physician outside a hospital has increased from 51 to 88 and the percentage completeness of registration has increased from 81 to 96, so that the effect and

importance of biases of registration, if any, must have declined. The sex ratio of nonwhite births has, nevertheless, continued to be lower than that of white births, with fluctuations that can be ascribed to random error. Further, if it is argued that a high stillbirth rate may result in a low sex ratio of live births, it may be noted that the number of reported fetal deaths (regardless of the period of gestation) per 1000 live births among nonwhites has declined from 57 in 1940 to 30 in 1959. (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1959). In fact, the true amount of decline in the fetal death rates is probably understated because the rates for the later years are based on improved reporting. However, the sex ratio of nonwhite live births has never exceeded 103.3 in any year since 1933 and the persistent difference between whites and nonwhites points to some biological factor at work.

Some additional evidence on the subject is available from a special inquiry undertaken in certain countries of Africa during 1951-54 in which the number of births of each sex occurring in hospitals and other institutions was ascertained. The results and the 95% confidence interval around each observed sex ratio are shown in Table 6. Thanks to the relatively small number of recorded births, the confidence interval is wide in some cases. The upper limit of the interval falls below 104.0 in the case of only one country-- French West Africa. Thus, the evidence from the African countries gives strong but not conclusive support to the hypothesis that the negroid populations have a lower sex ratio at birth than 104.0. Of course, additional data on

this subject need to be collected in different countries of Africa. In the meanwhile, on the basis of the impressive evidence from the United States and the West Indies, one can conclude that, probably, there operates, among the negroid populations, some genetic or racial factor, which leads to a somewhat lower sex ratio at birth than in the usual range of 104.0-107.0.
We now proceed to discuss briefly the data bearing on the deviant sex ratios at birth not associated with a significant negroid component in the population.
THE ASIATICS IN SOUTH AFRICA
The Asiatics in South Africa are predominantly of Indian origin, with a strong component of persons from South India and their descendants. A recent study of the live births recorded in some 549 hospitals and health centers of India during 1949-58 has reported, for the country as a whole as well as the South Zone, a sex ratio at birth of 106.4, with its 95% confidence limits of 105.9-106.9. (Ramchandran and Deshpande, 1964). However, the historical data on the live births registered in the Madras Presidency and the two native states of South India (Mysore and Travancore) do in-

dicate some bias toward an under registration of male births (Visaria, 1963). It appears that this tendency might have been carried over, continued and, perhaps, spread among the Asiatics by the South Indian Emigrants to South Africa.
CHILE
The low sex ratio of live births registered in Chile during 1949-1956 can be best examined in the light of the historical data presented in Table 7. Rather surprisingly, until 1945, the sex ratios were consistently within the usual range of 104-107. However, after 1945, even the 99% confidence intervals do not include the lower limit of the usual range. This shift is difficult to understand despite the steady downward trend in the sex ratio over the period 1926-- 1955. While one may suspect a progressive change in the Chilean population leading to a declining sex ratio of live births, the ordinarily very slow nature of such transformations stands against such a possibility. Also, the reported peak value of 107.0 during 1926-1930, the period of compulsory registration of births, suggests that the recent Chilean data are probably affected by selected registration.

HONG KONG
The sex ratio of registered live births in Hong Kong, a predominantly Chinese population, is higher than the upper limit of the usual range--107--at the .0001 level of statistical significance. Unfortunately, the similar information pertaining to the population of Mainland China is deficient in various ways (Chiao, 1934; Chiao, Thompson, and Chen, 1938; Ta Chen, 1946). However, Taiwan has reported, for 1949-1958, a sex ratio of 105.5 in nearly 3.8 million births, a value hardly different from 105.6 in 1929-1931 and 1940, and 105.7 in 1935 (Smith, 1952). Besides, the sex ratios of births among the Chinese in Malaya and Singapore were reported to be above the usual range until about 1947; but have declined to 106.4-106.6 during 1948-1961, when the vital registration has presumably improved. The Chinese migrants to Hong Kong are drawn generally from the same provinces of Mainland China as those in Malaya and Singapore; and the genetic factors making for a high sex ratio among the latter could not have dis-

appeared suddenly. The explanation for the unusual masculinity of births in Hong Kong appears, therefore, to be biases in the form of sex-selective registration.
ADEN
The unusual masculinity of births in Aden, a territory with a predominantly Arab population, appears to be spurious in the light of the data for various parts of Egypt presented in Table 8. Variations in sex ratios of births at the national level between urban towns of Egypt and rural areas having and not having health bureaus are statistically significant at the .001 level. Given the racial homogeneity of the Egyptian population and the fact that the urban populations are recruited from (or are descendants of the recruits from) the countryside, these inter-regional differentials once again point to varying magnitudes of biases in the form of seselective underregistration of births. The magnitudes of biases also appear to be associated with the degree of sociocultural development. In fact, the Egyp-

evidence emerges, Korea must be accepted, provisionally, as an instance of an abnormally high sex ratio.
SUMMARY

KOREA: A PERPLEXING CASE
A perplexing case of an unusually high sexratio at birth is Korea. Several years ago, a sex ration of 113.1 was reported in 5,340,868 births registered in Korea during 1921-1929 (Rüssel, 1936). In view of the Egyptian data above, one is inclined to dismiss this high value as a product of sex-selective underregistration, but recently a sex ratio of 116.94 hasbeen observed in 11,131 births in ten selected hospitals of South Korea during 1956-1960 (Kang and Cho, 1962). The 95%confidence limits for this sex ratio are 112.66-121.39 and even the lower limit is considerably removed from the upper limit of 107 of the usual range. Thus, until contrary

It has been shown about that 50 out of 80 values of the sex ratios of births registered during 1949-1958 in 76 territories reputed to have relatively complete vital registration fall within the usually stated limits of 104-107. Among the 23values of sexratios at birth below 104, 15pertain to populations with more than one-third of the total classified as negro, black or African, and colored or mixed. In the light of other historical evidence on thesexratio at birth among the negroid populations, one is led to conclude that there operates, among the negroid populations, some genetic or racial factor making for a slightly lowersex ratio at birth than among the non-negroid populations. However, the avail-

able recent data on late fetal mortality lend at best only weak support the hypothesis of an inverse relationship between prenatal mortality and the sex ratio at birth.
While most of the non-negroid sex ratios at birth falling outside the usual range of 104-107 can be explained in terms of random error, those for the Asiatics in the Union of South Africa, Chile, Hong Kong, and Aden need further study. An examination of thehistorical data for the same population or of contemporary data for similar populations points to biases in the form of sex-selective registration being the likely explanation. Korea, however, remains a perplexing case.
