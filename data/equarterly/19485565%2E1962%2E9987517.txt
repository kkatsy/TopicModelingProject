POPULATION DIFFERENCES IN RED AND GREEN COLOR VISION DEFICIENCY: A REVIEW, AND A QUERY ON SELECTION RELAXATION*

SEX-LINKED COLOR VISION DEFICIENCY
merits more consideration as a genetic trait for the study of population and race differences than has been given it, to judge from the relatively small number of reports in the literature of physical anthropology and human genetics. Certain details of the genetic basis may be unclear and a certain proportion of phenotypic classifications doubtful because of imperfect testing techniques, but the fact of relatively simple genetic control is certain. In almost all cases it is fully penetrant by early childhood and does not vary in manifestation. Furthermore, in certain situations the comparison in frequency estimates between two samples in the same city or region, or among several samples in the same region, show considerable resemblance or homo-

geneity. The present review aims to assemble
frequency estimates from as many population samples as possible and to discuss them briefly with regard to race, geographical propinquity, and the long term effects of selection. The estimates are presented in two tables. Red and green deficiencies are pooled together in the first table (as they are in most reports) and separated in the second. Such separation permits making rough estimates of mutation rates. In both tables the populations are divided into three habitat groups: A) hunters and food gatherers; B) populations somewhat removed from hunting in time or in habitat, but less removed than those in C--also, populations descended from mixtures between A and C; C) populations farthest removed from hunting in time, or habitat, or both. The marked clustering of low frequencies in A and of high frequencies in C is considered as evidence of the relaxation of the intensity of nat-

ural selection against "colorblindness" in habitat C as compared with A. The hypothesis of relaxation is discussed.
UNCERTAIN POINTS IN GENETICS
The principal genetic question is whether the alíeles for the two red deficiencies protanopia (Pi) and protanomaly (P2)--to use the most current terminology--share the same locus with those for the two green deficiencies deuteranopia (Dj) and deuteranomaly (D2), or whether they occupy two separate loci on the X-chromos°me- The former hypothesis is implicit in the procedure followed in most population studies of summing all male protans and deuterans regardless of the type or degree of deficiency in order to make an estimate of the frequency of over-all "red-green colorblindness." Females are reported separately, if at all. It is often assumed that there are two degrees of each type of deficiency, hence perhaps four distinct X-linked alíeles. But this is not certain: there may be three alíeles of each type, perhaps more (Jaeger, 1950, 1951; Pickford, 1950). The hypothesis of two loci is favored by most geneticists and, while evidence for it has been accumulating for some time (Franceschetti, 1928; Sorsby, 1951; Adam, 1961), it cannot yet be said to be proven. The question is well reviewed by Stern (1959), who comments: "At present, the differences between the two hypotheses is of little practical importance."
Some indication of the degree of this practical importance can be shown by a simple illustration based upon the rounded mean prevalence rates reported among males in samples of European populations. These are close to .01 for each of the first three phenotypes, Pj, P2, and Dj, and .05 for the fourth, D2 (Stern, 1959). Taking these as rough estimates of the corresponding gene fre-

quencies, under the single locus hypothesis the total frequency of sex-linked color-deficient phenotypes would be estimated at 0.08 (the sum), and the frequency of normals as 1 -- 0.08 = 0.92. Under the hypothesis of two loci, however, the total frequency of deficient males would be slightly less than this, since some X"cnromosomes would bear both a P and a D alíele. Thus the frequency of males with normal color vision would be (1.00--0.02=0.98) times (1.00 --0.06=0.94), or 0.9212. The frequency of those with color deficiencies would be 0.0788, consisting of protanopes (0.02X 0.94=0.0188); of deuteranopes (0.06X 0.98=0.0588); and of males with both deficiencies (0.02X0.06=0.0012). The discrepancy in phenotype frequency estimates between the two hypotheses for European populations is thus seen to be negligible, and it would be still lower for non-European populations, all of which have lower prevalence rates.
The unsatisfactory "fit" between the combined rate of both types of deficiency in females and the square of the combined rate in males in most population studies is at first glance disturbing (Danforth, 1924; Majima, 1961). However, in the two largest of the European studies in Table 1, the red and green deficiencies are reported separately. This permits Chi-square tests to be made (Table 3) of the fit between the "colorblind" females observed and the number expected from squaring the frequency estimates of males, after separating the red and green data in each study. A satisfactorily close fit is thus obtained, whereas pooling of the red and green data gives a worse fit, as anticipated. These results add to the evidence for the two-loci hypothesis, and therefore indicate that estimates of the total frequencies of sexlinked "red-green colorblindness" alíeles

in populations based upon overall prevalence rates of males are slightly too high.
Other genetic doubts arise over such questions as penetrance (Knox, 1958) in hemizygous males and in each of the several genotypes of females other than the homozygous normal (Schmidt, 1934; Pickford, 1948, 1953; Jablonski, 1957), and

whether still other color deficiencies than those involving red and green may be sex-linked. Clarification of these questions may be expected to lead to methods of refining gene frequency estimates in populations based on phenotype counts. However, it is believed that some value may accrue in the meantime to the examination of overall prevalence rates

made from field reports on samples of males, at least in outlining some of the characteristics of certain populations.
THE DATA
While the present tabulation has been aimed to include all the published population data on sex-linked color vision deficiencywhich are based on testing with the Ishihara plates, the compiler is well aware that there must be many omissions and would appreciate readers notifying him of them. Red and green deficiencies are pooled in Table 1 in the interest of directing attention to major differences between populations. Prevalence rates among females are cited from the relatively few studies supplying them. The square root of each female rate is given, despite the several errors which this figure entails. The two deficiencies are separated in Table 2 for those studies which report them separately.
It is probable that the tabulation includes about all the errors to which any set of data could be subject. The imperfections in testing techniques are too wellknown to be discussed here (Dunlap, 1942; Hamilton, 1944; Hardy, 1946). The studies are dated from 1922 through 1962. Description of sampling procedure is often unsatisfactory. Despite its inherent weaknesses, justification for the tabulation will be found, it is hoped, in demonstrating the resemblances between certain pairs of populations and the homogeneties among certain groups of populations, and also in suggesting an explanation for some of these differences.
DISCUSSION OF TABLE I
Perhaps the most striking observation is the high degree of consistency of the rates among the 33 samples from Europe, Great Britain and the United States, most of which lie fairly close to 0.08 (excluding the Russians of western

Komi S. S. R. who, incidentally, are rather different from other Russians in their blood group frequencies). Only four samples fall below .07 and only six exceed .089. The English samples are remarkably uniform, particularly the three rates .070, .068, and .066 from, respectively, the East Coast of England, Greater London, and the area thereabouts whence the plurality of the Air Force candidates hail. Four of the five Scottish rates are certainly close together --.072, .075, .077, and .078. The fifth, from the Northeast of Scotland, is a wide deviant (.054) which will be discussed later. (Each of the nine British Navy series is said to contain at least 6,000 observations.) Other close matches are seen in the two samples of school boys in Basel, Switzerland, with rates of .080 and .082; two from Oslo, Norway, with .101 and .080; three from Belgium with .074, .086, and .090.
Samples from more widely separated populations of the same race are also notable for their consistencies. Thus, five samples of Chinese--all of good size and one enormous--have rates of .050, .050, .056, .063, and .069. Twenty-four of the Prefectures of Japan sampled by the Ministry of Education and reported by Sato (1935) have an impressively narrow range of rates--.036 to .042, with an overall mean of .0395, based on 259,060 school boys. Turks in Istanbul and Persians in Tabriz are not far apart with .053 and .045, respectively. Samples from five populations of African Negroes are more scattered, with .017, .019, .025, .027, and .030; in contrast, five samples of American Negroes have rates of .028, .034, .039, .039, and .042. Samples of Mexicans in Mexico City and in Colorado are as close as .023 and .025, respectively.
The samples were divided into the three habitat groups A, B, and C defined

above as a step in the search for evidence of the hypothesis of selection relaxation. In the case of color vision deficiencies, this evidence would have to depend upon assumptions which have never been demonstrated but which do not seem to be unreasonable. First, it is assumed that color vision deficiency has been a handicap of some moment among the hunting and food-gathering populations of group A, with an approximate equilibrium between the elimination by natural selection of genes which produce deficient color vision and their origin through mutation. Since all members of a hunting society must constantly find their way through unmarked wildlands under all conditions of color and light in their unending quest for food and for all the raw materials required by domestic industries, considering particularly the frequency in primitive societies of stresses when the penalties for deficient color vision are most dire, the assumption that color vision deficiency is a definite handicap may be entertained seriously. Furthermore, it must be assumed that in settled habitats such as those of

populations in group C the handicap imposed by deficient color vision has been completely removed, and thus that the rate of selective elimination of genes producing color vision deficiency is no greater than that of the genes producing normal color vision. (This discussion raises many points which cannot be answered yet, among them the marked superiority of some "colorblind" persons in recognizing camouflage.)
Acting on these assumptions, the difference between the overall prevalence rates of samples of populations of group A contrasted with those of C may be taken as evidence of the result of diminished selection pressure against the deficiency-producing alíeles in the second habitat group as compared with that in the first. The overall rates for groups A, B and C in Table 1 are respectively .020, .032, and .051 based on pooled sample sizes of 7,712, 9,443, and 436,853 males. While the diversity of the composition of the samples in each group is too great to justify refined estimates of statistical significance of the difference between A and C, its magnitude (.051--

.O2O=.O31) is impressive and merits serious consideration as evidence in support of the relaxation hypothesis.
Further examination of Table 1 fails to suggest any basis for grouping the various samples other than on the basis of habitat. The lowest rates are of samples from aborigines of Australia, Fiji, America, and India, most of the last being "tribes" still living in a quasi-hunting habitat. The highest rates are of Caucasian samples, but not far below them are the five samples of Chinese and eight of Indian Brahmins. With such great diversity of races and geographical locations among the samples within either a high or a low range of rate, it seems impossible to use either race or propinquity as a major basis for classification. Indeed, the only basis which can be found is habitat as here defined.
The only flagrant exceptions to the association between rate and habitat are the three small samples of Brazilian Indian fullbloods and the Kotas of India, the rates of which are too high for A. While all four samples may be suspected of coming from small gene pools and therefore of being subject to the eccentricities of genetic drift, the possibilities of a prevailingly higher rate among Brazilian aborigines (at least in the two tribes sampled) than among those of North America is seriously entertained by Salzano (1961), and a similar explanation might apply to the Kotas. Their high rate reminds one of the Todas, another Indian tribal group, whose rate (0.128) is the highest on record. It was reported by Rivers (1905) among 320 males and is considered reliable even though the measurements were made before the development of the Ishihara test.
Race is further discounted because of the low rates among all North American Indians in contrast with the high rates

of the Chinese. Further illustrations of negative associations between race and rate may be found in the studies based on color vision deficiency tests developed earlier than that of the Ishihara plates, which are tabulated by Clements (1930) and others.
Further evidence of relaxation may be seen in the low rate of .054 for the 6,000odd British Navy recruits from the Northeast of Scotland which was noted above. This is the lowest rate of all the samples of Caucasians in the present tabulation, the closest to it being .066 for the 16,180 candidates for the Air Force --and it seems reasonable to suspect that this last may be as low as it is because the sample may not have been drawn at random, insofar as men conscious of having any color vision deficiency might reasonably spare themselves the trouble of being rejected by an organization so well-known for its high standards of testing. The Northeast of Scotland is one of the least industrialized and urbanized areas in the United Kingdom. Further, it was the last of the major areas to emerge from the habitat which might be called paleolithic, in which one might speculate that the survival value of abnormal color vision would have been lower than under the habitats which followed it, which might be called neolithic. In contrast, the longest history of neolithic habitat in the United Kingdom is undoubtedly to be found in the South of England, and it is here that the highest rates of color vision deficiency are found--.095 in Southwestern England and .089 in South Central England--in areas where the first sedentary cultures developed and flourished and where the longest history is found of the civilization of Rome.
Relaxation is also suggested by the higher rates of several samples of Indian Brahmins in contrast with those of other

castes and of the tribes still in a quasihunting habitat.
DISCUSSION OF TABLE 2 j
MUTATION RATE ESTIMATES
Under the two-loci hypothesis the prevalence rate among males of the red or the green deficiencies may be used as estimates of the frequency of each corresponding set of mutant alíeles, assuming complete penetrance at the youngest ages tested. Since the degree of deficiency cannot be really well defined by even the most careful testing, and since the number of alíeles is in doubt, pooling of the various degrees of deficiency of each type is desirable. It entails no loss in accuracy. Following Fernandez (1957) and Junqueira (1957), the mutants producing the red deficiencies (protans) may be designated as cv^, and those producing the green deficiencies (deuterans), cvV Their prevalence rates are shown in Table 2-A, B, and C for all 31 of the population samples in which the prevalence of red and green deficiencies are reported separately (4 in Table 2-A, 6 in B and 21 in C).
By scanning the columns of Table 2 it is noted that the prevalence rates of cv?! and cv^ support the relaxation hypothesis as well when considered separately as do the joint rates in Table 1. Hunters have the lowest rates, populations farthest removed from hunting have the highest rates, while populations moderately removed from the hunting habitat have intermediary rates. (This conclusion is based in part on the sample of 230 Brazilian Indians reported by Mattos (1958) in which there is not one case of color vision deficiency, but it is not supported by the two samples of 35 and 43 Brazilian Indians, which have high rates, as noted above.)
Certain details are brought out more clearly by rearrangements for three sub-

groups as in Table 4, these subgroups being Negroes, continental Europeans, and Jews tested in Israel. Pooled rates show Europeans and Jews to be indistinguishable in the frequency of protans (.0222 and .0193, respectively), but the former have higher rates of deuterans than the latter (.0577 and .0403). Thus the ratio of the pooled rates of CVPX and cv^ is .38 for Europeans and .48 for Jews. The Negro rates are less than one-half those of the Europeans in both deficiencies, and the Negro ratio is .37. The variances of the rates are considerably higher for both types of deficiency among the eight Jewish samples than among the seven samples of Europeans or the four of Negroes. The latter are particularly homogeneous in cv^. Many interesting details of differences in the rates of the two types of color vision deficiency among populations are brought out in Table 2, and are too numerous for comment here.
The relatively high homogeneity of the prevalence rates of the seven European samples for both types of deficiency tempts one to hazard making an estimate of the mutation rates at the two loci. Assuming that selection against both sets of alíeles which produce color vision deficiency became negligible following the introduction of domestic animals and agriculture with the Neolithic era, it would follow that cvpi has increased from approximately .005 to .02 during the ensuing interval, a change of .015; similarly, that cvd2 increased from .015 to .06, a change of .045 (viz. Tables 2-A and 4-B). Acting on these assumptions, both increases must be attributed solely to mutation, or to net mutation after subtracting any possible reverse mutation. Estimating the elapsed time as 3,000 years or 120 generations, the mutation rate per generation would be .015

140 Post

-ï- 120 = 0.000125 for the aggregate of alíeles which produce protans and .045 - H 1 2 0 = 0.000375 for those producing deuterans. If 4,000 years are allowed instead of 3,000, as might be more reasonable for some of the populations, the mutation rates become 0.00009375 and 0.00028125; if 5,000 years are allowed, they would be 0.000075 and 0.000225, respectively. Whatever date is assigned to the earliest neolithic culture in Europe, it would seem reasonable to suppose that the hunting habitat was displaced during many generations fairly gradually and slowly and perhaps centuries thereafter, and that complete relaxation may not have been achieved until perhaps about Iron Age times.
To speculate briefly in another direction, we might consider the selection force necessary to maintain protanopia and deuteranopia among hunting populations when selection and mutation are in equilibrium at the gene frequencies estimated above, i.e., .005 and .015, respectively. Since selection is theoretically the quotient of the mutation rate divided by the gene frequency (when the loss in the frequency of a mutant alíele per generation is balanced by replacements of this alíele by mutation) or
s = (Li, 1961), we may make estimates of "s" by substituting the above values for q and use maximum and minimum mutation rates arbitrarily chosen as 10-4 and 10-5 for "u." The resulting selection forces seem intuitively rather low, namely, from 7 to 200 "genetic deaths" per 10,000 persons per generation
estimates of mutation rate u = 10--* u = 10--5 protanopia, with q=.005 s=.O2 s=.002 deuteranopia, with q=.015 s=.007 s=.0007
NOTE ON RELAXATION
The concept of relaxed selection, with

consequent reduction of ñtness in plants and animals under domestication and in man under the gradual changes in habitat resulting from the growth of culture, has been widely discussed since the earliest days of Darwinism. Examples are readily cited in the failure of one or another variety of domestic plant to survive without cultivation in competition with wild plants; the failure of dogs' ears, among most breeds, to stand erect and turn towards a particular sound; the small size of the human fifth toe. Perhaps most of the speculation in man has concerned traits or conditions or functions under genetic control which have benefitted the most from advances in modern medical therapy (such as diabetes), or in public health (such as the hereditary form of endemic goiter), or in living standards (such as pulmonary tuberculosis), rather than those which are believed to have been under relaxed selection for several millenia (such as acuity of vision and hearing). The advances in medicine, public health, and living standards have been so marked that it is not difficult to imagine the survival of many persons today who might not have been able to live long enough to reproduce had they been born several thousand years ago when selection was, in certain respects, more rigorous.
The confusion resulting from this speculation has been great, and particularly damaging to eugenics. Some clarification may come from considering the following suggestions. 1) The concept of relaxed selection should not be applied to an entire species, including the human species, but rather to specific hereditary traits to be considered one at a time. 2) Two distinct habitats are implied, each with its own rate of selection pressure--a higher rate in an aboriginal or "wild" or "natural" habitat, usually

The selection pressure of the second habitat is called "relaxed" only when compared with that of the first. 3) A mutant alíele which is suspected of having increased in frequency in the second habitat as a result of such relaxation in selection pressure must be considered to

have no adaptive advantage in this habitat over the "wild type" gene. If it is supposed to have an adaptive advantage in the new habitat, the resulting evolutionary change would properly be attributed to progressive adaptation, not to relaxation. 4) A relaxed selection rate might be further qualified as one which is lower than the rate of mutation with

respect to a specific mutant alíele in the second of two specific habitats, disregarding the possibility of reverse mutation. If the selection is completely relaxed, i.e., zero, it follows that the population frequency of the mutant alíele being considered in the second habitat is approximately the product of its net mutation rate times the number of generations under such relaxation, plus its frequency in the first habitat. (Since the frequency of a mutant alíele would increase progressively with each generation under such circumstances, the frequency of the "wild type" gene remaining at risk of mutation would correspondingly decrease, but at a continuously diminishing rate. Therefore the previous statement is an approximation.)
The best traits for studying relaxation are those under simple genetic control (as contrasted with control by multiple genes) having congenital manifestation or full penetrance at a fairly early age, relative stability in all habitats, susceptibility to rather precise measurement, and significant variation in frequency among different populations in a variety of habitats. At least two of these habitats should be under contrasted selective pressures as far as these can be estimated by the necessarily subjective methods at hand.
Perhaps the red and green color vision deficiencies are among the best traits for the study of selection relaxation. They fulfill the above requirements and offer a certain literature of population studies. Whether or not they demonstrate the phenomenon of relaxation, however, is a question which each student of evolution must answer independently.
SUMMARY
1. Some of the genetic hypotheses and uncertainties in sex-linked color vision deficiency are noted.

2. Prevalence rates of red and green color deficiencies are tabulated for all the population samples found in the literature so far, as estimated by testing males with the Ishihara color cards.
3. Among the lowest rates are those of the aborigines in Australia, Brazil, Fiji, and North America. The highest rates are of samples in Europe and the Far East, including Brahmins of India. Intermediary rates are of Negroes in Africa and the Americas, other groups in India, and various hybrid groups.
4. All of the lower rates are of populations with simple or primitive cultures until recently, for which it might be assumed that color vision deficiency would be a handicap in life in the unmarked wildlands. Under stress this handicap would frequently be fatal. There is no concrete evidence for this assumption, but it seems reasonable.
5. All of the higher prevalence rates except for three based on very small samples are of populations which have had pastoral-agricultural economies and settled habitats for at least three millenia. It is assumed that in these habitats a "colorblind" person of either sex could be as successful in living and procreating as a person of normal color vision; again, no concrete evidence for this assumption is known.
6. From the above considerations the total frequency of alíeles producing the red color vision deficiencies are roughly estimated to have increased from .005 to .02 in European populations during about 120 generations; the green, from .015 to .06. Assuming that selection at both loci has been completely relaxed during this time, the net mutation rates (discounting reverse mutation) for all deficiency-producing mutant alíeles at each locus are then .015 -f- 120 = .000125 or 1.25 X 10~4 for protans, and .045 -f- 120
