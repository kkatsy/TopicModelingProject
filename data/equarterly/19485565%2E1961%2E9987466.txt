PREDICTIONS IN FERTILITY*

MARIA DAVIDSON

JL/URING THE PAST two decades there have been a number of field studies of factors associated with size of family. A few of these have collected data from both wives and husbands. In most cases the studies have been restricted to wives, largely for reasons of economy. It is apparent that full coverage of both partners not only doubles the number of questions to be asked but often necessitates the scheduling of evening appointments because the husband is away from home during the day.
Despite the practical importance of the problem, no studies have been directed toward ascertaining whether the relation of fertility to characteristics of the husband is the same or different from the relation of fertility to similar characteristics of the wife.
This paper attempts to examine whether fertility behavior can be predicted with the same degree of accuracy from the social and psychological characteristics of husbands as from those of wives. The major fertility studies in the past have related fertility behavior mainly to the characteristics of wives. The researchers of these studies tacitly assumed that the obtained results would have been the same if the characteristics

of the husbands had been substituted for those of the wives. Freedman, Whelpton and Campbell (1959) have stated explicitly that some differences might have arisen in the results if data pertaining to husbands had been obtained directly from husbands instead of being supplied by the wives. Since the inclusion of husbands would have necessitated a substantial reduction of cases, these researchers decided to choose a larger sample restricted to the wives (Freedman et al., 1959). Their decision probably would be endorsed by many demographers. Yet they leave unanswered the important question of whether reliance on information from only one spouse is sufficient. This is the essential question being investigated in this paper.
THE BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY
This paper is based on data collected for two different studies, the Kelly Study of marital happiness and the Indianapolis Study of fertility. The first data of the former study were collected by E. Lowell Kelly in the mid-thirties from 300 engaged couples, selected from announcements in eastern newspapers. Although Kelly was concerned with the study of marital happiness, the collected data also contained certain information regarding fertility behavior. The basic design of the study involved annual contact with the couples for an extended period of time. The advent of World

War II interrupted the plan, but in 19534 Kelly managed to learn the whereabouts of all the couples and to secure the desired data from a majority of them. Despite the fact that the data are not representative of the United States population (the engaged couples are largely restricted to the urban Northeast with about 65 per cent of them having some college education, and only about 10 per cent of them being Catholic), they are of unusual interest due to the longitudinal design of the study.
The second set of data used in this paper are from the Indianapolis Study. The purpose of that study was to examine whether fertility behavior could be predicted from the social and psychological characteristics of the couples. The data were collected in 1941 from a sample of 860 native-white Protestant couples married during 1927-9 living in Indianapolis, neither previously married, husband and wife having completed at least the eighth grade. The ex post facto design of the study complicated, to a certain extent, the interpretation of the results.
THE VARIABLES AND THE METHODS
OF ANALYSIS
The dependent variables used in this paper are: (1) the total number of live births and (2) the size of completely planned families. A host of independent variables are considered in this analysis; the most important among them are: age at marriage, education, socioeconomic status, size of parental family, and liking for children.
Regression analysis was chosen as the most appropriate method. This method permits the introduction of factors which are related to the dependent variables with all of the other variables held constant. Of particular interest are the

weights assigned to each independent variable by the regression equation. The coefficient for each independent variable in the equation is an index of the weight which the observations for that variable should be given in making estimates of the variance of the dependent variable. If these weights are expressed in standard units they are called beta coefficients. A value near zero for beta (either positive or negative) implies that the independent variable considered is of comparatively little importance in accounting for the variance of the dependent variable. These coefficients, like other statistical measures, are subject to sampling variations.
In order to select variables which have a high probability of influencing the dependent variable and not to select variables which have small weights as a consequence of sampling variability, a set of 95 per cent confidence limits was established for each beta. If zero falls within this specified confidence interval, then the variable must be suspected as having only a chance relationship with the dependent variable. Such procedure should help to establish which factors have high predictive values. For the Kelly data, confidence intervals for the betas were omitted because of the nonrandomness of the sample.
Table I contains the beta coefficients for the regression equations based on the characteristics of husbands and wives, respectively, from the Kelly data.
A comparison of the two regression equations in Table 1, one predicting total fertility from the characteristics of the husbands and the other from the corresponding characteristics of the wives, shows that net regression coefficients are, in most cases, approximately the same. Important exceptions are age at mar-

riage, size of parental family, and education. The regression coefficients for the first two variables are higher for the wives than for the husbands, but the coefficient for education is higher for the husbands than for the wives.
Attention may now be turned to the relation of characteristics of husbands and wives to completely planned fertility. Table 2 presents the beta coefficients and the corresponding regression equations.
As indicated by Table 2, the net regression equations based on the characteristics of wives tend to be larger than those based on the corresponding characteristics of husbands. Thus, in this study the characteristics of wives are better predictors of completely planned fertility than those of the husbands. Furthermore, from the Kelly data, the results with regard to total fertility are incongruous with those relating to completely planned fertility. Since the data are from a highly selected sample, caution must be used against generalizations beyond the data.
Next will be examined the relationships of the characteristics of husbands and wives from the Indianapolis Study

to their total fertility and to their completely planned fertility. The beta coefficients based on certain characteristics of husbands and wives and the regression equations are presented in Table 3.
Table 3 shows that, in general, the factors significantly different from zero for the wives are also significantly different from zero for the husbands. However, two factors--index of general planning and marital happiness of wives-- have a somewhat weaker relationship to total fertility than the corresponding factors of husbands. In general, total fertility can be predicted with approximately the same accuracy from the given characteristics of husbands as from the same characteristics of wives. Between the data from husbands and those from wives, there is some difference in the magnitude of the net regression coefficients, but it is not large enough to be of importance.
The relationships between the characteristics of husbands and wives and completely planned fertility are presented in Table 4.
Table 4 indicates that the beta values for four characteristics of husbands and wives used for prediction of completely

planned fertility are significantly different from zero at the 5 per cent level. Three of these characteristics (number of children desired, index of liking for children, and index of economic security) have beta values significantly different from zero at the 5 per cent level for both husbands and wives, although the values are somewhat larger for husbands. The factor of education has a much higher predictive value for wives than for husbands insofar as size of completely planned family is concerned.
Both the Kelly and the Indianapolis Studies show that total fertility canbe predicted with approximately the same accuracy from the characteristics ofhusbands asfrom those of wives. In contrast, the predictive values of the characteristics of husbands aredifferent from those of thewives for completely planned fertility. The lack of congruity of the results in thelatter case isprobably dueto sampling fluctuations. Due to certain shortcomings of the data of both studies, conclusive generalizations cannot be made. However, the results obtained suggest that predictions in fertility studies should concentrate on completely planned fertility. This type of fertility

behavior is important also because, in the near future, planning of family size will become increasingly important in countries of Western civilization.
SUMMARY
The test of the hypothesis that fertility behavior can be predicted from the social and psychological factors of either spouse was the subject of this paper. The data of the Kelly and the Indianapolis Studies were used for testing the hypothesis. The method used was that of regression analysis. These data supported the hypothesis with respect to total fertility but not for completely planned fertility. Since both sets of data suffer from certain shortcomings, further testing of the hypothesis is necessary for reaching conclusive results.
