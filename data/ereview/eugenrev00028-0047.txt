A Further Rise in Births in Britain

SOME FACTS

IN THE JANUARY 1962 issue of the REVEw it was shown that births in the United Kingdom, having risen to apeak of 1,025,000 in 1947, de-
clined to around 800,000 a year in the period 1952-55; and that their numbers have since gained ground quite steadily and undramatically to reach 940,000 in 1961. The increasing tendency has since continued, and it now seems likely that the total number of live births registered in 1962 may reach 980,000. Another twelve months of such growth might well bring the number of new babies up to the 1947 level-the maximum of "the bulge"; but this time there is no special temporary "post-war" factor in the immediate effects of the return home of large numbers of men from the armed forces, and therefore no
particular reason to expect a rapid fall away from this high level. Indeed, even a further augmentation is not impossible.
In these circumstances special interest is to be found in the statistical analysis of the birth registration data in order to ascertain, if possible, what are the main characteristics of the recent

developments. The principal elements to be looked for are the age at marriage and year of marriage of the parents, and the way the number of their children has grown as the length of time they have been married has increased. In one recent analysis of this kind,* Messrs. C. M. Stewart and J. R. Ford measured the proportions of married couples with 0, 1, 2, 3 ... children at each marriage duration, and by combining a number of different sources of information arrived at a graphical picture of recent fertility history in this country.
In broad terms, this picture is one of:
i. War-time marriages having an average proportion of first children-showing infertility to be normal-but fewer second and third children than other marriages; no doubt this loss is an effect of the war itself.
ii. Post-war marriages having rather more children than immediate pre-war marriages.
iii. Among post-war marriages, a slower rate of family building among couples married in the years around 1952 than among those married before or since that period.
The following figures were given by the authors for England and Wales in order to show

the trends in the most recent years. They relate to the total, for each of the calendar years 1952-58, of the fertility rates for all durations of marriage; they show the numbers of first, second third, fourth . . . children born to a thousand women, married only once, according to age at marriage.
The figures show a widespread increase in births-except for the very largest families in the

case of young marriages. Comparing these data with their general picture, the authors saw some reason to believe that the numbers of births in the early 1950s were if anything below average and also that the numbers in (and since) 1960 are higher than normal. If they are right, then a reduction in the annual number of births towards 900,000 a year may be expected before very long.
