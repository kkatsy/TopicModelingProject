RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTELLIGENCE AND SIZE OF FAMILY
By F. W. WARBURTON

IN the course of a research carried out in the University of Manchester on capacity
and opportunity for university education, Leybourne-White8 found the following median scores for students, grouped according to size of family, in the untimed ver-
sion of the I938 Matrices non-verbal and in tlTe Moray House Adult 2 tests of intelligence.

The socio-economic level of the fathers of the students (derived from the classification of Carr-Saunders and WilsonL in The Professions) was:

The poorer students tend to come from the smaller families. A similar tendency was noted by Himmelweit,2 although the socioeconomic levels in the two researches are not strictly comparable, as the systems of classification are not the same.
Product-moment correlations between students' intelligence test scores and the size of family are:

This gives no indication, of course, of the
relationship between the size of the family and its average intelligence, since only the
brighter children in each family are likely to attend the university.
In this sample, there is no definite ten-
dency for the more intelligent students to come from small or from large families.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTELLIGENCE AND SIZE OF FAMILY 37

Correlations between the intelligence of the students and the number of siblings are positive and insignificant, i.e. they are effectively zero. At the London School of Economics,' low negative correlations were found.
