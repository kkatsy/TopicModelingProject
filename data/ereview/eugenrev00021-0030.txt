In studying the prevalence of a specific disease in the children of parents with that disease, the family index can also be used to pick other diseases in parents and children to emphasize contrasts or similarities.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

This table makes it quite clear that if a parent
has a duodenal ulcer he or she is much more
likely to have a child who suffers from a duodenal ulcer. Moreover, the excess of incidence over the number expected is surprisingly more marked among the daughters.
Whether this is a genetic influence or one of environment cannot be discussed here, but these tables clearly illustrate how the family morbidity indexing can isolate the problem.
The difficulty in interpreting the findings of our studies is equally well demonstrated by the analysis of duodenal ulcer patients who have also a psychoses or psychoneurosis. The sex differences are particularly remarkable among the larger group of duodenal ulcer patients with psychoneurosis. The difficulty is, which comes first ?

the N.H.S. record to the solution of this group of problems is illustrated in Table 7.

Whether there is a genetic link in the male between psychoses and/or duodenal ulcer only further studies can reveal.
Husbands and wives may have the same disease or different but related diseases. Illness in one spouse may lead, through mental or physical stress to disease in the other; through the direct effect of infection, or the indirect effect of selective mating. The possible contribution of
26

None of these differences is striking and this underlines the need for caution and detailed study.
Some of the social implications of diseases can also be readily studied by simple analysis of the family index without any special inquiry of a group of patients; for example, it can be shown that epileptic patients can and do marry and have unaffected families.

Of these 56 marriages, only four had epileptic

By relating administrative records of persons

leaving the practice it is possible to see whether

patients with a particular disease leave more

commonly than other patients. This is frequently

an unknown source of bias in epidemiological

inquiries. It was found for example, that among

men and women patients with D.U. (aged

20-44) 8*8 per cent out of 227 had left the

practice during 1961. The proportion of com-

parable patients with psychoneurosis who left

the practice during the same period is 4-6 per

cent, contrary to expectation.

Another type of analysis examines consulta-

tions recorded on N.H.S. records for families

where a certain disease is present. For example

we wished to discover whether the children of

parents with clinical hypertension or the sibs of

such patients had a higher than average incidence

of the same or associated disease. In order to

obtain preliminary evidence that this method

was worth attempting, we compared the annual

consultations of the children of hypertensives

with consultations of the children of non-

hypertensive controls matched for age and sex

and household composition. In a pilot study

there was a suggestion that the daughters of hypertensives consulted more frequently than the control group daughters. The age structure of the practice made it impossible to study the sibs of hypertensive patients in sufficiently large numbers at the present time. This is an example of a temporary limitation in analysis which will vanish with the ageing of the practice.
Conclusion Since the Morbidity Indexing by Families has
been set up it has been fully confirmed that this system can be kept up to date for the day-to-day requirements of general practice. The annual incidence of diseases recorded can be obtained quite as readily as the prevalence. The advantages of this familial morbidity pattern being available to the partners in the Practice has been confirmed on many occasions. The examples given demonstrate the wide scope of the studies that can be and are being undertaken from routine general practice clinical recording.
