THE FREQUENCIES OF SEX COMBINATIONS IN HUMAN FAMILIES.
By A. S. PARKES, B. A. (Cantab.), PH.D.
Introductory.
In a recent paper in this journal I gave some data collected from the Peerage relating to the variation in the sex-ratio in different sizes of families. These data showed that whereas small families had a very large excess of males, large families had only a nornial excess, or actually an excess of females, and it was suggested that the explanation of this fact had a social rather than a physiological basis. As mentioned in that paper it was intended to make a more detailed analysis of the data, and Professor Carr-Saunders was good enough to communicate with the writer and urge that further analysis should be attempted. It was decided, therefore, to proceed in two directions; first to study the actual and probable frequencies of the different possible sex combinations in the different sizes of families to see if these confirmed the original conclusion drawn from the crude sexratios, and second, to see what statistical evidence could be found pointing to the presence of social factors.* The results of the first of these two investigations are given in the present note, together with a foreword on previous work of the same nature ; the results of the second it is hoped to give later.
In the human subject the sexes are produced in approximately equal numbers, the number of males per 100 females born in most European countries being usually 104-106. In addition, this ratio is remarkably constant from time to time and from place to place. This condition of things is often said to represent a chance distribution of the sexes. In the first place, however, th slight excess of males seems to be a constant occurrence, and there is another group of facts which suggests that the distribution is not entirely one of chance, namely, the discrepancy between the observed and probable frequencies of the different combinations of the sexes which are found in families. In 1888 Venn (7) gave some figures collected from the pedigrees in the Herald's Visitations showing that families where the two sexes were even or nearly even in numbers, had a less than probable frequency, while families with a big excess of one sex or the other had a greater than probable frequency; in other words the
*If, for instance, families of, say, three had a materially different ratio from
that found for the first three children of large families, social factors could clearly
be demonstrated, and in addition it was suggested by Professor Carr-Saunders that a historical study, by half centuries, could be used to show approximately when family limitation began in the aristocracy.

families had a small tendency towards unisexuality. As Venn's book is scarce and is now out of print it may be useful to give his actual
data, which are summarised below.

Much more extensive material put forward by Prof. Gini (2) shows the same result to a less degree, that the frequency of the families in which the sexes are fairly evenly mixed is slightly below the expectation. Prof. Gini deals with families from two to twelve, and deficiency of such evenly sexed families is most striking in families of 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12.
Two other previous investigations should be mentioned. Nichols (4) found tolerable agreement between the probable and actual frequencies in an investigation on a large number of families ranging from 6-18 in size, while the same result was obtained by Newcomb (8) for the whole range of possible sizes of families. In the latter case, however, only difference of sex, not the actual sex, was considered.
It is fairly safe to assume, therefore, that in a large series of observations on normal populations, little divergence from the probable is found, though the supposition that there is a slight tendency to unisexuality in human families is supported by Brewster's (1) conclusion that where a sequence of one sex or the other has occurred the next child has a greater than normal probabilty of being of the same sex.* The Peerage data here presented, however, must be considered, like Venn's figures, to be of a somewhat abnormal
nature.

Material and Methods.

The correct basis for the calculation of the probable frequencies is a matter of some importance. Two alternatives present themselves, namely, to use as a basis the mean proportions of the sexes in the
whole material under revi'ew, or to 'calculate the probability for each size of family on 'the basis of the proportions found in the families of that size. The relative merits of these two alternatives depend entirely on the difference in the sex-ratio in the different sizes of

*In view of these results it is curious to note.that in pig litters the descrepancy seems to be reversed. The present writer found (5) that litters where the sexes were fairly evenly balanced had a much greater than probable frequency and that the litters tending to unisexuality had a much less than probable frequency.

families and the fluctuation from the mean. In the paper on pig Jitters it was shown that the small variation in the proportions of the sexes in the different sizes of litter caused the two systems to give much the same result.
As regards my own human material, the following table is taken, with additions, from the previous paper (6)

The variations from the mean are thus signiificant in all except
two cases, and in four cases are large when compared with the prob-
able errors. It is quite clear, therefore, that from a purely statistical point of view it would be quite misleading to calculate the probable frequencies on the basis of the mean proportion of males, but for the present object such a method is useful, and in the following discus-
sion two sets of probabilities are calculated, (1) on the basis of the ratio found for that particular size of family, and, (2) on the basis of the total mean.

Calculated from the formula *6745 V' 1where m and f are the proportions
of males and females, and N the number of individuals.

Observed and probable frequencies of sex combinations.
In the previous paper on pig litters it has been shown that the very nature of this type of data makes the correlation table for size of family and sex-ratio of but little use, and we may therefore pass straight on to Table IV, where are shown the actual and probable frequencies.*

This table shows that, though the observed frequencies show no great or regular departure from the probable frequencies calculated on the individual bases, a considerable discrepancy is found when they are compared with the probable frequencies calculated on the basis of the mean ratio of the whole observations, and a glance shows that in small families those with excess of males have a greater than probable frequency, whilst in large families those with an excess of females are in the excess. If the families of each size showing excess and no excess of males are grouped together and compared with the probabiliites, the results, as shown in Table V, are quite striking.

These results are quite in accordance with the previous observa-
tions that the sex-ratio of small families tended to be high, and that the sex-ratio of large families tended to be low.
It is to be concluded, therefore, that the original result founded on the crude sex-ratios is correct, and that as the families stand, small families have a strong tendency to high masculinity and large families a tendency towards femininity. If this result were only illmarked it is not improbable that a physiological explanation could
be found, but since the tendencies are so pronounced it is most
probable that some such social factor as was discussed in the previous
paper is at work. It is hoped in a further paper to go into the statistical evidence
for this view.
