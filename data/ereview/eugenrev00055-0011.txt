Classes III, IV and V. It is widely held that improvements in
living conditions and diet have contributed greatly to the striking fall in both the stillbirth and the infant mortality in recent years. While this is no doubt so, the fact remains that there has been little or no narrowing of the gap between the rates in the various social classes. Why should this be so ? Is it because the resources of the educational and social services have not been directed to the points where they are most needed or are

During the last three years in Aberdeen
(I950-52), a comprehensive study has been
carried out on some of the many constitutional and environmental factors which play a part in childbearing. (Baird and Illsley, I953.) The survey has covered certain aspects of medical, dietary, social and psychological fields of study. Much of the data collected within each field has not yet
been analysed, so that any report at present

This paper is concerned solely with the relationship between Progressive Matrices test scores and four different aspects of
patients' behaviour before and during first pregnancy; these are as follows:
i. Use of birth control.

INTELLIGENCE AND CHILDBEARING

2. Use of sources of information about pregnancy and labour.
3. Quality of diet during pregnancy. 4. Intention to breast-feed.
For each aspect of behaviour, information given by the patients forms the basis for gradings.
1. Use of Birth Control
Patients were asked during interview whether they had ever used any method of birth control, whether they were still using contraceptive methods at the time of conception, and what their plans were for future use of birth control.
It is recognised that this is rather a diffi-
cult subject to discuss. There may be considerable risk of influencing the patients' responses by leading questions, and care had to be taken to avoid this. The subject was introduced by asking patients how many children they wanted to have, how long they would like between first and second children and how they proposed to accomplish this. It was then easier to ask if they had " taken any precautions before," whether they were " still continuing at time of conception " and what plans they had made for after their first pregnancy.
A further difficulty lies in analysing the use of different methods of birth control. Numbers do not allow us to consider each method separately, so some form of grouping had to be chosen. If we group methods of birth control according to whether husband or wife is mainly responsible we find insufficient cases in the " wife's " group for statistical treatment. We have grouped together all appliance methods, that is, mechanical and chemical methods whether used by wife or by husband, and all non-appliance methods, that is, coitus interruptus and safe period, and thus we obtain adequate numbers in each group. As use of birth control methods is to be analysed by wife's intelligence test score and husband's social class, it may be argued that better results might be obtained by a "responsibility" grouping -thus relating husband's social class to methods where husband is responsible, and wife's intelligence to methods where wife is

responsible. It will be remembered, however, that we can understand something of the couple's social class and intelligence level from our available measures of husband's social class and wife's intelligence level. The results seem to justify this grouping by appliance and non-appliance methods.
Use of birth control is distinguished from effective use in the following results:
(a) Use of birth control before first pregnancy. This information was obtained from 384
patients, (383 who attended the second session and one who attended the first only. As five patients were not tested the tables are based on 379 cases). Of these couples 204 had used some form of contraception before first pregnancy-I32 used non-appliance (twelve safe period) and 72 appliance methods (three diaphragm). Ten couples had used two or more methods combined, and nine couples had used different methods at different times. These nineteen couples are classed in the appliance group if mechanical or chemical methods were ev.r used, and as non-appliance if only non-appliance methods were used.
There is a highly significant association between husband's social class and the use of birth control. As can be seen from Figure II, 75 per cent of couples in Social

V said they used some type of birth control. This relationship holds for Matrices grades A and B and for C. D and E cannot be tested because of small numbers.
Wife's intelligence test grade is associated, but not significantly, with the use of birth control of all types. Birth control, however, is more extensively used in the higher intelligence test grades. This trend holds for all social classes, and within each class, but never approaches significance.
Intelligence test grade is not significantly related to whether appliance or nonappliance methods of birth control are used, which appears also to be a social class phenomenon. There are highly significant differences between the social classes in methods used. Of those using birth control, nofi-appliance methods were used in 50 per
cent of cases in Social Classes I and II, 58 per cent in Social Class III, and 84 per cent in Social Classes IV and V. These results parallel Lewis-Faning's report (I949) although direct comparison is not feasible owing to differences in the samples. It appears that " tested" intelligence in this sample may be a contributory factor in the use of birth control, but plays no part in determining the methods to be used.
Older women use birth control more extensively irrespective of intelligence test score, which may be an effect of the higher proportion of older women in Social Classes I and II. We cannot test this because of small numbeys. The association between test score and the use of birth control is more marked in the younger age group under twenty-five years of age. There are no significant differences between the over and under twenty-five' age group for' different methods of birth control, although older women show a greater tendency to use appliance methods.
(b) Continuing use of birth control at time of conception.*
It is not, of course, suggested that mere use of birth control indicates planning for

first pregnancy. The failure of contraception in the group who used birth control, however,
will give some indication of unplanned first pregnancies. (Figure III.)

The proportion of those couples still using
birth control methods at the time of concep-
tion increases significantly with a fall in the
wife's intelligence test grade. We find the same relationship within each social class. There are no significant differences in this
" failure rate " between social classes. Thus
" successful " use of all methods of birth
control by the couple is related to the higher intelligence grade of the wife. This supplements Lewis-Faning's suggestion (I949) that " education " is related to skill with which contraceptive measures are applied
by the couple. Younger women are concerned in a higher
proportion of " failures " than older women. It is possible that this is due to a lower fertility rate in the older group (Monahan, I950), perhaps-supplemented by the greater care taken by couples in this group as will be noted in other aspects of behaviour. In the younger women " failures " occur more frequently in the lower intelligence grades, while among older women the differences between test scores for " failures " is negligible for all methods, together or separately.

dietary survey. The method employed was that the patient weighed her total food intake for one week in the seventh month of pregnancy. For the purposes of this study the calcium intake has been used to classify the quality of the diets. Calcium intake is determined mainly by consumption of milk and some milk products. Where these are high, diets as a whole tend to be better.

It seems possible that this might be a social
class effect as it will be remembered that Social Classes I and II tend to have a greater proportion of older women, but small numbers do not allow us to test this. However, older women have perhaps had more opportunity to gain knowledge of pregnancy and childbirth. In addition, older women, irrespective of social class, give the impression of being more careful in their planning and preparation. This may mean that they will use outside and clinic sources of information in order to clarify the knowledge they havegot through social experience. Younger women because of their youth will have less opportunity to gain knowledge of pregnancy and childbirth through social experience, and here the use of better sources of informa-

(Thomson, I953.) A daily intake of I,500 milligrams or more is usually recommended during pregnancy and for the purposes of this paper we have classified a diet as good if it contains over I,000 mg. daily, average if between I,ooo and 750, and poor if below 750 mg. This classification allows sufficient numbers in each group for statistical analysis. Social Classes I, II and III have had to be grouped together since there were only sixty cases between these three classes, the remaining II4 being from Classes IV and V. The preponderance of cases in Social Classes IV and V is due to the fact that the policy has been to study dietary intake in as many cases as possible in Social Classes IV and V,

in which nutritional problems are likely to
be at their most severe. We find a highly significant association
between quality of diet assessed by calcium intake and social class. There are fewer poor
quality diets in Social Classes I, II and III, than in IV and V. The diagram suggests that intelligence test grade may be associated with the quality of the diet within social classes. Within each social group, the quality of diet improved as the intelligence grade improves. (Figure V.)
4. Breast-feeding Patients were asked during interview
whether they intended to breast-fe.ed or bottle-feed their babies. Their responses were carefully noted verbatim and subsequently graded by three investigators independently on a five-point scale. A " Very Good" grading was given when the woman indicated that she was eager to breast-feed, and her statement had contained no reservations. For example, the reply " I'd like to breast-feed-if I can of course," was regarded as a qualification and was graded " Good." At the other end of the scale, a " Very Poor" grading was given when the woman said she did not intend to breastfeed, and a " Poor" grading when she said she did not intend to but added some qualification such as, "I expect I shall have to breast-feed in hospital." " Poor" and " Very Poor " grades are combined as " Poor" because of small numbers. Statements about breast-feeding were obtained from 384 cases (383 who attended both sessions and one who attended one session only). The following table is based on the 265 of the cases for which follow-up information is so far available.
Figure VI shows that women with higher Matrices grades appear to be more eager to breast-feed than women in the lower intelligence grades. This same association holds within Social Classes III and IV and V. Classes I and II cannot be tested because of small numbers. A similar trend can be shown independently between social class and intention to breast-feed (Ross, I95I), SO that both intelligence and

social class seem to play a part in determining attitude to breast-feeding. It may be contended that this is because women with higher intelligence test gradings or in upper social classes are more aware of the social pressures towards breast-feeding, thus are more likely to say they will breast-feed. Our hypothesis is that women who have stronger intentions, even if this be due to awareness

of social pressures, will in fact be more likely to breast-feed. The social investigators have
been following up cases for three months after delivery to see which patients still continue to breast-feed. This data is so far available on the 265 cases. While it is appreciated that there can be sound medical reasons for the cessation of breast-feeding,
it is proposed to consider all cases together irrespective of reason for stopping. In Figure VII, patients have been divided
into those still breast-feeding or giving com-
plementary feeds, and those who have completely stopped breast-feeding. The data was collected at the thirteenth week after
delivery. Figure VII shows the highly significant

We would like to consider, for example, size and spacing of the completed family, together with the incidence of maternal or infant illness or mortality in seven to ten years' time. It would be of practical value to the obstetrician if we could show that intelligence and maternal behaviour in first pregnancy could indicate future behaviour in planning and caring for the completed family.
Acknowledgments The psychological survey, as indicated,
forms part of a wider inquiry into the facts
of reproductive efficiency, and I am very grateful to my colleagues who have generously given me data from their own parts of the investigation, and for much practical assistance, helpful criticism and advice in the preparation of this paper.

HSUSBN'S SOCIAL CLASS
In hospital patients, corresponding roughly to Social Classes III, IV and V, tall women appeared healthier than small women. The state of health was assessed subjectively at the antenatal clinic into one of five grades varying from excellent to very poor, and
Table i shows that amnongst those assessed
as being in excellent health 4I per cent were tall and ii per cent small, whereas of those graded as poor or very poor, I4 per cent were tall and 44 per cent small.
The incidence of prematurity and stillbirth was twice as great in small as in tall women and in women of the same height was twice as frequent in those in poor or very poor health compared to those in

to ensure that they get good food and healthy
surroundings. The daughters will, therefore, tend to grow to their full height and to be healthy. Since the parents are above average
intelligence for their class the daughters are
likely, on the average, to be more intelligent. In addition their superior health and home
background will probably increase their chance of doing well in the intelligence test. Where the parents are less intelligent there is less likelihood that the size of the family will be so carefully controlled so that there will be less money to go round and as a result diet and living conditions will be less good.

C) NUMBER Of CASES
As already stated small women show relatively high prematurity and stillbirth rates. They also require Cesarean section frequently because of disproportion between the baby's head and the mother's pelvis, whereas in women of 5 ft. 4 in. or more Caesarean section for this cause is rarely necessary.
Table 4 shows the shape of the pelvis in ioo tall and ioo small women divided into two groups according to whether the health was judged to be good or poor.

INTELLIGENCE AND CHILDBEARING

is practically round; flattening of the posterior segment of the brim is a sign of disease. The capacity of the brim is directly proportional to the height of the woman, consequently the small and unhealthy woman has not only a deformed but a small pelvis, hence the high incidence of difficult labour and the high Caesarean section rate. It is difficult, therefore, to believe that such small women are fully grown.
Although it is known that childbearing is unusually dangerous in small unhealthy women they nevertheless are much more prone to have large families. In Aberdeen Social Class V contributes I2 per cent of first births and 30 per cent of fifth and subsequent births.
Table 5 shows that in the Aberdeen Maternity Hospital the proportion of small mothers increases with the increase in the number of children.

Forty per cent of those having a seventh
or subsequent child are under 5 ft. i in., and in a series of cases where pregnancy was
terminated or sterilization was performed,
because of multiparity and debility 42 per
cent were small. Such patients are unable to help themselves and are usually living in
sordid conditions, the husband often being unemployed. Sterilization gives the woman instant and complete relief from the constant
dread of pregnancy and leaves her free to
concentrate on the care of the children she
already has. In properly selected cases it contributes greatly to the happiness and stability of the family. Maternal mortality and stillbirth rates are high in this group but

under the active policy pursued in Aberdeen such women contribute nothing to maternal mortality and very little to the stillbirth rate.
From the eugenic point of view little can be said against it since our investigations suggest that children of such parents are less likely than average to be of high intelligence and in any case the poor environment makes it unlikely that they will be able to make full use of their inherited abilities.
Miss Scott has shown that 34 per cent of childbearing women in Social Classes IV and V are of poor or very poor intelligence. The combination of low intelligence and poor environment makes the effective use of contraceptives almost impossible in these cases. They constitute a problem group in which surgical measures may be necessary to prevent further unwanted pregnancies which would almost certainly prove disastrous to the health and well-being of the mother and family. As Social Classes IV and V contribute 30 per cent of the total births and as we have seen one-third of the child-bearing women in these social classes are of low intelligence, it follows that this
problem group of low intelligence in a pbor
environment comprises about IO per cent of all childbearing women.
In Aberdeen in the last four years the' average stillbirth rate was twenty-a low figure by past standards-yet there are still many small unhealthy women in the city whose reproductive efficiency is low. Many of these are intelligent enough to do very much better. Women of the same level of intelligence in the upper economic groups reproduced more efficiently. There is still, therefore, much scope for lowering the stillbirth rate by improving the social and economic conditions of the lower income
groups.
