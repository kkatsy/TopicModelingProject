A STUDY OF THE INTELLIGENCE OF ANGLO-CHINESE CHILDREN

By P. C. HU
(From the Department of Psychology, University College, London)

I. OBJECT OF THE INQUIRY
HE present investigation was carried
out with the object of determining the
general intellectual level of AngloChinese children, and of discovering what differences, if any, exist between their general standard of intelligence as compared with that of English children, selected from the same social environment. With this object in view the East End of London and Liverpool were chosen as the most suitable districts in which to carry out the main portion of the research. Anglo-Chinese communities have existed in these districts for nearly a century, and small groups of halfcaste children are here easily accessible to the investigator. To obtain precise information about the population, and particularly about the numbers of half-caste children residing in these areas, is by no means easy. In London they are scattered over many different schools, and accordingly the simplest plan seemed to be to choose the chief examinees from the Chung Hwa Club* for Anglo-Chinese children, and to test them in the club itself. The children attending this club must be of Chinese parentage; otherwise, no special qualification is necessary and no fee is paid, the members therefore forming a group typical of the total AngloChinese population. In Liverpool the halfcaste children are nearly all grouped together in the three schools; these therefore were tested in the school itself.
In both London and Liverpool the children

of mixed parentage form only a small minority; and it would be useless to compare them with a paired control group containing an equally small number of English children. We need, if possible, to compare the average intelligence of both communities estimated as a whole. The method here adopted was to test the entire number of English children at the five London schools which the majority of the Anglo-Chinese children were attending. In Liverpool, to obtain sufficient numbers the English children were tested at five schools: three of the schools were attended by Anglo-Chinese, the other two by English children only, but the social status and economic conditions were much the same as those of the halfcastes.
2. SUBJECTS, TESTS, AND METHODS
The total number of children tested was 2,943 English and II6 Anglo-Chinese. This number was divided into two groups, namely (a) those between 8-io years of age, and (b) those between II-I4 years of age. The latter group was tested (a) with the Northumberland Standardized Tests,* and (b) with perceptual tests.t As the standard of these two tests was considered to be too difficult for the younger children between 8 and IO, a further test, namely, the opposites test (Test 2 of Northumberland Standardized Tests) was employed. After the completion of these group tests, a performance test of intelligences was used with every half-caste and

founded in 1928 for the benefit of Anglo-Chinese chil-

Voluntary workers arrange numerous useful and enjoyable extra-school activities, such as sports meetings, first-aid classes, etc. Evening courses are provided in which the children are taught (in English) about China and Chinese life and instructed in the elements of the Chinese language.

with a group of representative or average English children from London and Liverpool who were selected in the following way. Between II-I4 years of age the averages were determined by the Northumberland group test. Between the ages of 8 and IO, the average children were chosen by means of the Opposites Test. The number of average children thus selected was, as a rule, ten from
each group-five boys and five girls. They
were chosen so that the home environment, social and economic status, father's trade and earnings were as similar as possible to those of Anglo-Chinese children. In some cases, however, it was found that one or more of the conditions under consideration did not conform to the ideal basis of selection. Hence the numbers of children in any particular age group are not always exactly identical. No English children of I4 were selected for individual testing. This is the school-leaving age in elementary schools, and consequently a sufficient number of the children could not be obtained.
In all, in both London and Liverpool, I07 English children, aged 8-I3, were thus selected.
3. DESCRIPTION OF RESULTS
Differences obtained with the Northumberland Tests
With the Northumberland Tests, the Anglo-Chinese show consistently better results than the English children (see Table I).

Expressed in terms of marks, their superiority is shown in the first column of Table II below.

Having seen from the above table how the Anglo-Chinese and English children compare with each other, we may now proceed to a
comparison of the marks of the half-castes with the standard of norms. This shows that, judged by the standard norms for the general population, the Anglo-Chinese in London are practically up to the average at ii and I2
years of age; at I3 years, however, their marks are little above the theoretical norm
of a child of I2; while at I4 the average mark of the Anglo-Chinese child differs but slightly from the norm of a child of I3.*
With regard to the East End English children, the marks show that the average score of the children of ii here tested is

harder for the Anglo-Chinese than for the native English. This last objection can be
easily set aside, since for the Anglo-Chinese children here tested there was no language difficulty whatsoever. It must also be
remembered that many of the children to whom group tests were given were also tested individually, and the results of the two types
of tests confirmed each other. Above all, it would seem from the correla-
tions that the different types of tests give similar results and are really measuring the
same thing both for the English on the one hand and for the Anglo-Chinese on the other. According to the correlations between the
three groups of tests calculated, it appears that a difference of race did not affect the relations between the tests any more than a difference of town.
The probable errors were calculated separately for each coefficient of correlation, but it will be sufficient here to note only the high-
est and the lowest. The probable errors ranged from o o65 for the lowest correlations to o o44 for the higher correlations.

5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The main outcome of the results detailed above may be thus summed up.
i. In the Northumberland, perceptual and form board tests, the Anglo-Chinese children on the whole excel the English.
2. In the opposites test, English children, from 8-io years of age, are slightly better than half-caste children.
3. Generally speaking, London children, both English and half-caste, appear mentally superior to Liverpool children of both races.
6. SUGGESTED EXPLANATION OF RESULTS
A glance at the above conclusions indicates that an attempt should be made to answer two fundamental questions: (i) Why are the mental abilities of Anglo-Chinese children superior to the English children ? (2) Why are the London children superior to the Liverpool children ?
In regard to the first question the following tentative suggestions may be offered.

educational environments are so dissimilar, the actual standard of the educational
achievements will likewise vary considerably. The innate difference in intelligence, if it
exists, would be a little harder to explain.
One might, however, suppose that in the main the more intelligent of whatever race would tend to gravitate and to hold their own in the capital. Since living is cheaper in
Liverpool, and since the standard of comfort is lower, one would naturally get there lower
representatives both of English and of foreign populations than in the metropolis.
In conclusion, the fact that really there are no very significant differences in regard to intelligence must be repeated and empha-

sized. The mere fact that a little group of Anglo-Chinese children on the whole excels a little group of English children in certain selected tests does not of itself mean very much, and the main result of the present research can do no more than suggest, what the psychologist previously suspected but may possibly come as a surprise to the social worker and to the plain man, that the difference between the two races is after all extremely small.
