PROBLEMS OF RADIATION GENETICS
N. P. DUBININ
Translated by G. H. BEALE

This book gives a concise account of the effects of different forms of radiation
on living organisms, and includes a very thorough report of Russian contributions
to the subject as well as those of Western workers. Among other topics the author
also considers the danger to man of increased amounts of radiation in the atmosphere from radio active fall-out, the hazards to pilots of spaceships from cosmic
radiation, and the more positive applications to plant and animal breeding.
