THE EUGENICS REVIEW

It would appear that both total natural growth and net immigration are relatively low in Britain-only 10 per cent of the American figures for a population 30 per cent as large. The complicating factors for Britain are, of course, emigration and an older age-distribution.
American national statistics do not permit a

study of fertility by duration of marriage, but it is possible to give an analysis of the female population in 1960 classified by age and number
of children born alive. The data, which are as follows for ages 20-49, exclude never-married women, but include widows and divorced women:

Although none of the age-groups shown had a mean family size of as many as three children, it is expected that the younger women whose marriages are not terminated by death or divorce will, when their families are completed, be seen to have attained to this number on the average.

On the basis of the results of the 1951 Census in Britain, it is possible to construct a similar statement, and corresponding figures for 1961, though not yet available, should soon be published. The British figures for 1951 are approximately as follows; they relate to married women alone:

As with the Americans, the younger British women are expected, when their families are completed, to surpass the average family sizes shown for the older women in the foregoing table. Moreover, during the period since 1951 the general level of fertility in Britain has risen by nearly 20 per cent, thus giving rise to the
mean family size of 21 children mentioned
above. It is clear, nevertheless, that large

families are still much more popular in North America than here, as the following data show:
