between the two medium projections for the year 2000. This arises mainly from Latin America (300 million), Africa (400 million), India (200 million) and the Rest of Asia (500 million), i.e. from the politically non-committed and economically under-developed part of the world. For these areas the difference of view between the two authorities is remarkable. The United Nations' experts expect to see a trebling of population in Latin America and Africa, and more than a doubling in India and the Rest of Asia, in the period 1960-2000, whereas the Professor expects a good deal less than doubling in all these areas.
Technically speaking Professor Boyarsky's approach is crude. He first assumes the numbers of births per annum to be constant over a considerable past and future period, and on this basis adjusts the population size for improving longevity by the use of ratios of expectations of life at birth at various times. Then he rates up the result by a percentage, varying from 0 to 20 according to region, on general grounds after discussing the probable fertility trends. This method does not pay sufficient regard to the fact that over many areas the annual numbers of births have not remained constant but are increasing rapidly. The Professor argues from Western European experience, in which rising populations have been combined with rapidly falling fertility. This is of doubtful validity for Africa, Asia and Latin America. Wherever sound data are available in these continents this is seen to be so, for instance in the following illustrative examples of data, said to be

384,000 423,000

It is true that in many areas the trend of the numbers of births is unknown, and that where
it is known the period of years covered by the information is short; yet it is logical to expect that as total population has increased so also have the annual numbers of births; otherwise, a corresponding fall in fertility would have occurred, which in the light of our general knowledge seems very unlikely indeed.
As the United Nations projections have been made in great detail it is possible to form some idea of the extent of the fall in fertility that would be necessary for the projections of Professor Boyarsky to be realized in practice. Thus for India, the United Nations' alternative projected populations for the year 2000 are:

Fertility constant at present levels Fertility declining from 1970 to one-half its
present level Fertility declining from 1965 to one-half its

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

From this it may be inferred that, on Professor Boyarsky's approach, leading to a total of only 690 million, the average level of fertility assumed for the last four decades of the present century must be something like two-thirds of its amount in 1960; the level of fertility in the year 2000 would be well below one-half of its present value.

Such an assumption is not, however, made explicit in his paper, and there seems little hope that such a rapid evolution of thought in relation to family size could come about in India. The implications for other parts of Asia and for Africa and Central and South America are similar.
