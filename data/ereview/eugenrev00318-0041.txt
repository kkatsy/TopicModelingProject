EUGENIC ASPECTS OF THE COLWYN REPORT*
BY ELDON MOORE.
Of greatest eugenic interest in this Report are the comparisons made between the economic conditions of the country at various periods. The table set out below is copied from page 236, excepting the bottom line, which gives the figures for 1923, and the extreme right-hand column, giving the index figures for income per head after the deduction of the debt charge. These aie roughly calculated from information supplied elsewhere in the Report, in order to make the table complete.
The table only confirms and gives accuracy to the belief that conditions of life in England have enormously and steadily improved during

N.B.-1818 In there was no external debt; but in 1923 interest, management, and
repayment of the external debt amounted to £47-31 millions p.a.-a burden of
£1 per head of the population. * Report of the Committee on National Debt and Tazation (Cd. 2800). London,

the last hundred years-not quite four generations. This fonfirmation
was scarcely needed in view of other facts already known-e. g., the equally steady fall, 'from 1851 onwards, in the number of persons per house, the constantly increasing amounts spent upon social services,
and finally the declining death-rate and the increasing population. The table, in fact, understates the rise in the general standard of
living; for in 1818 the taxation necessary to pay the debt charge was levied indiscriminately and fell with great weight upon the poorest classes-i.e., the bulk of the nation. The first two (and possibly the third) lines in the penultimate and last columns therefore show the general position fairly accurately. But the lower lines, and particu-
larly the last (for 1923) are misleading; for of late years (especially -during and since the war) a constantly increasing amount of the
National Debt has been held by small investors. On the other hand, the money is no longer raised by indirect taxation from the nation as a
whole, but by direct taxation from a small proportion-roughly 21
millions. Making the generous allowance of a wife and two children
for each taxpayer, we find that 10 millions, or between 20 and 25 per cent. of the population, pay, in direct taxation alone, 50 per cent. of the Budget (both Majority and Minority Reports, incidentally, comment on the curious and baseless superstition that direct and indirect
taxation should be roughly equal). This way of putting it is, obviously, misleading. The following
table will give some idea of the real burden borne by the direct tax-
payers and of their contribution to Governmental services:

In 1818, therefore, rich and poor alike were taxed to provide the holders of Government securities (a small proportion of the population) with £16-5 millions. But by 1913-14 the position had been reversed, the direct taxpayers alone contributing a substantial amount to the country's expenditure upon Defence, Social Services, etc. In 1923 they contributed an amount absolutely much larger, though smaller relative to the totals of direct taxation and of the Budget. This, however, is to be expected; for it would be impossible to raise over
£400 millions from 21 million people whilst returning only 28 per cent.
of it. The fact remains that in 1923 the direct taxpayers contributed enough to pay not only the total cost of the Defence Services, £105 8 millions, but also 75 per cent. of the Parliamentary expenditure on Education, £41.43 millions ("Drage" Report.)
It should also be remembered that direct taxpayers contribute more than their due in indirect taxation as well. The Report, unfortunate-

Above the £1,000 mark the taxation and percentages rise rapidly. The incomes are assumed to be wholly earned, and the taxpaver to have tl-hree childreni under the age of 16. The last assumption is
unjustified, in view of the facts (1) that a larger proportion of Incometaxpayers than of the inon-Income-taxpayers are unmarried and (2) the iiumbcr of children per family above the £200 mark is nearer 1
than 3. In practice, that is, taxation rises more rapidly than appears
among thcse lower incomcs and the percentages do not therefore start witlh so big a drop. One would like a table in whichi no children are
attributed to the taxpayer. Whatever his income, no mani can consume more thain a strictly
limited quantity of sugar, tea, tobacco, etc. ; the indirect taxation on
thiese articles, therefore, weiglhs, proportionately, the most heavily upoIn the snmallest incomes-hence the regression in taxation percentages on incomes from £100 to £500. Progression tlhereafter is due to the graduated Inconme-tax and Super-tax. The signatories of
the Minority Report, however, who positively splutter at the existing
inequalities of wealth, are reduced by this regression to the emphasis
of italics. .They consider-quite regardless of their own figuresthat "a considerable part of the wage-earning population must be
seriously over-taxed," to provide bond-holders with interest; and they recommend that inidirect taxation, which thus hits the poorest, on articles of common use should be avoided. Even the signatories
of the AMajoritv Report seemn to be guiltily uneasy at the limited cap-
acity of the human body to absorb more than a certain quantity of sugar-though they do not object to the taxes on the working-man's
tobacco and beer. Both Reports, in shiort, are obsessed by various
ill-formulated ideas of 'equity'- "It's unfair that the poor should be
taxed," etc.
These ideas are out of place. Justice and equity are man- nade
conceptions, and vary, therefore, with every individual. It might equally well be urged that it is unfair for those of high-earning capacity to be forced to support those of low-eariaing capacity; and that £14 a
year is not much to pay for the finest Defence, Police, Sanitation,

Education, etc. in the world-not to speak of the ultimatc security of the Poor Law. The business of such a Committee is to consider, Inot
disputable questions of equity, but the yield and consequences of taxation, past, present, and future. This it does-to some extent. But whiilst considering the effect upon the revenue of our diminishing natural increase every year, it utterly fails to conceive of the effect of
taxation upon tl-lat natural increase. Careful consideration is given to the possible effects of Iincome-
tax uponl a man's ability and willingness to work and save; but no thought at all is given to its effect upoIn the size of his family.
The wlhole Report, in short, is utterly non-eugenic; tllough there was nothliing in the terms of reference to preclude eugenic consideratioIns. Eugenists may be startled to find themselves on the side of
the Mlinority Report in recommendinig the Capital Levy as a means of reducing debt. Certaiiily the continued higlh and possibly higherIncome-tax recommended by the l\Iajority Report is dysgeniic in its effects. But the sud(lein slharp axe of the Capital Levy could have noine
-provided of course, there was iio fear of its repetition. Moreover, it would affect but few of the middle and lower-middle classes (being levied on niothiing under £5000); and ill reduciing the scale of livinig of the wealtlhy, it might reduce the standard of living desired by the less wealtlhy-and so encourage larger families.
The various Death-Duty schemes conisidered seem nmore ingenious than sound. Scant attention is paid to Inheritance Duties which, with but little trouble and at small cost to the State, might be given a greater eugenic twist tlhan at present i.e., the estate of £10,000 might be muletedl of £5, 000 on passiing to one soni, but of nothlinig on passinig to
ten. But in aiiy case the possessors of large fortunes are so few as to
be of little accounit statistically in a lpopulation of 47 millionis, whatever they may represeint biologically.
Mr. C. R. V. Coutts poiiited out in a letter to The Times (March
19th), " 'National Debt' itself is a misleading label . . . If these loans had been labelled 'National Savings Investments' the expansioni of them nmight be regarded with satisfaction as evidence of national thrift. "
The Nationial Debt, in slhort, beinig owed by the counitry to itself, is not an entity, but ani unreal abstraction. To attempt to lighten the weight of this imaginary burden, therefore, at the very real cost of the Income-taxpayers would be dysgenic madness. It is true that a very large proportioni of them would benefit by that repayment-only to re-iinvest their savinigs in other securities. Redemption would not enhance either their ability or willingness to rear larger families. But taxation undoubtedly reduces both. It is surely better to bestow upon posterity niore tax-payers than lower taxes.
Too much weight, however, can easily be attached to Iincome-tax as a factor in the differential birth-rate. In 1904, for instance, it was only £17 5s. lod. on an earned income of £500 p.a. (married man with 3 children). This could scarcely have affected his ability to rear children. It fell to £13 5s. in 1913-14, rose to the considerable figure of £35 just during the War, but had fallen again to £10 3s. 4d. in 1925-26. It is highly doubtful, too, whether it could at all affect his willingness, as distinct from his ability, to support a large family.

42 EUGENICS REVIEW.
Income-tax was first levied in 1842, at the rate of 7d. in the £. Its history, unfortunately, is not given in the Report, but the burden could have varied very little during the seventy-two succeeding years, being Ild. in the £. in 1903-04 and Is. 2d. in 1913-14-in the last year, too, those with incomes between £200 and £500, a considerable class, were receiving abatements for children. Yet those were the years when the birth-rate rose to its maximum and started on the decline. The year 1877 actually marked the turning-point, and Income-tax certainly did not rise noticeably then nor in the preceding years.
This does not imply that it is necessary to resort to biological mysticism, and ascribe the fall in the birth-rate to some ineluctable "wave of infertility." The causes-which now exist and are more ,effective-were probably economic, but more widespread and less direct than the Income-tax, with more subtle psychological repercussions. Just about that time education began to replace ostentation as the grand snobbery of the upper classes. They were getting accustomed, too, to a fast rising standard of living and-possibly the most important factor of all-pressure of population first began then to make itself felt. The decade 1871-80 was the only one between 1851 and 1921 when the builders failed to keep pace with the babies, and the number of persons per house rose from 5.33 to 5.38. A minute rise and more than rectified by 1891; but it may have had a disproportionately large psychological effect. It added to the growing feeling of lack of 'elbow-room' in a country rapidly filling up-a feeling which would have had its first effect upon the most far-seeing. As the difficulty of getting started in life began to grow among the professional classes, one can well imagine young married couples wondering about the possible future of children as yet unconceived. The possible dysgenic effect of over-population in civilised human communities calls for more detailed study than it has hitherto received. The effects of over-population are, of course, highly eugenic among animals, who do not suffer from prevision and other psychological complications.
Considering that £264 lOs. is the total direct taxation levied today on an income of £2,000 it is obvious that no rebates can have much effect upon ability to rear children. Were the whole allowed to a man with that income, it would not compensate him for the cost of educating even one of his three sons! The possible moral effect upon the willingness to reduce the standard of living in order to rear a family, deserves more consideration, however, especially if accompanied by proper education and propaganda.
Returning to the first point in this article, the Report shows beyond shadow of doubt that conditions of life, particularly of the poorest classes, enormously improved between 1818 and 1914. The signatories also think, on balance, that conditions continued to improve between 1914 and 1926-for over and above the more or less stationary figures of real wages, account must be taken of the immeasurable benefits of improved social services and a shorter working day. The final conclusion is that there has been a real, if small, advance, one greater among the unskilled labourers than among the skilled.
It has yet to be shown that this century of "progress" has resulted in a people of better quality-the evidence points in the other direction.
