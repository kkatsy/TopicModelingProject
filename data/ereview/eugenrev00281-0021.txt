DESCENDANTS OF ALEXANDER ANDERSON
A man died in '794. His name was Alexander Anderson. He was a miller, at Inverugie, Aberdeenshire, as his ancestors had been for two .hundred years before him. His descendants dunng the past twenty

generations were killed in the war, i9i4-i8. This wonderful history is befittingly re-
corded in a private compilation, admirably
produced by Mrs. A. D. Ferguson and Lt.-Col.
C. F. Anderson, of which the present writer was privileged to obtain a copy.

General Staff, a First Lord of the Admiralty,
an Amnbassador to the United States, a
President of the Royal Society of Water Colour Painters, a Chairman of the South Wales Coalowners Association, a Principal Woman Factory Inspector, a Master of Caius, a Fellow and Tutor of Balliol, a Fellow of Trinity, Cambridge, a Regius Professor of Botany, one of the earlier women M.P's, an M.P. for the City of London and a Colonel-Commandant of the Engineers. In. finance, comm.erce and industry, the record has also been noteworthy. The Orient Line is the creation of his family; two of the
descendants already mentioned have been chairmen of very important companies such
as Impenral Airways, Dunlop Rubber Co.,
and the Rio Tinto. One of rather earlier date not mentioned before died amillionaire,t
and another a multi-millionaire. The honours won incluide two G.C.B's, two K.C.B's, two
C.B's,. two G.C.M.G's, one K.C.M.G. and three C.M.G's; .two G.B.E's, one D.B.E.,
two C.B.E's, four O.B.E's and one M.B.E.;

A further question is often put to eugenists. How does one account for valuable qualities suddenly appeanng when, if they existed at all in previous generations, they were apparently masked? Part of the answer may be supplied by the study of such families as this.
It cannot be said that there is here any
history of humble origin. The great-great-
grandfather of the Alexander Anderson who died in I794 was the skipper and probably the owner of the ship that took the fifth Earl Marischal to Denmark to conclude the' marriage by proxy -of James VI and Anne
of Denmark. The bride was detained at Oslo by
storms. It will be remembered how the ardent bridegroom became impatient and dared the dangers of the tempest, which he attributed to the wiles of the North Berwick
witches at whose subsequent trial he presided
with zest. On the anrival of his Royal Master
the Earl Marischal was sent home. He appears to* have had warm feelings of

We can'learn something from the record Physique

regarding vital statistics and physical attributes. Let us take age at death; this is
recorded where known (I have omitted the two younger generations, most of whose members are alive and where death has occurred it is often attributable to the war.)
Bearing in mind how frequently the
members -of the family spent their life abroad, one must regard them as a long-lived race. More died between o0 d 8o than in

Omitting the last generation, the unmarried seem to come to about 40 per cent.,

gave rise to the very conditions which suited their abilities.
The compilers of the Record point out that
the late J. M. Wood of Aberdeen, a learned
genealogist, was of opinion that all the
Andersons of Ross, Sutherland, Elgin, Banf
and Aberdeen sprang from the same ancestor.
This raises a very interesting point. Galton,
in Hereditary Genius., speaking of James Gregory, the inverntor of the reflecting
telescope, says: "He was the most impor-
tant member of a very important scientific
family, partly eminent as mathematicians
and largely as physicians. The annexed
pedigree (p. 207) is necessary to explain their relationships but I should add (although it

eighteen persons of note) that I know it does
