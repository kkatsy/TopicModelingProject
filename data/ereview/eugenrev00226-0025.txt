A Proposed Standard System of

Nomenclature of Human Mitotic

Chromosomes

The statement which follows was drawn up by a study group which met together to formulate an
agreed system of nomenclature for human chromosomes with a view to eliminating the confusion which has arisen from the independent publication of a variety of systems by different workers. Its signatories hope that, by its publication in a number of journals in different countries, it will be of real service to human genetics in general and to the study of human cytology in particular.

In contemporary publications the tenns, karyotype and idiogram, have often been used indiscriminately. We would recommend.that the term, karyotype, should be applied to a systematized array of the chromosomes of a single cell prepared either by drawing or by photography, with the extension in meaning that the chromosomes of a

single cell can typify the chromosomes of an individual or even a species. The term, kdiogram, would then be reserved for the diagrammatic representation of a
karyotype, which may be based on measurements of the
chromosomes in several or many cells.

GROUP 13-15 Medium sized chromosomes with nearly terminal centromeres ("acrocentric" chromosomes). Chromosome 13 has a prominent satellite on the short arm. Chromosome 14 has a small satellite on the short arm. No satellite has been detected on chromosome 15.
GROUP 16-18 Rather short chromosomes with approxi-
mately median (in chromosome 16) or
submedian centromeres.

GROUP 6-12 Medium sized chromosomes with submedian centromeres. The X chromosome resembles the longer chromosomes in this group, especially chromosome 6, from which it is difficult to distinguish. This large group is the one which presents major difficulty in identification ofindividual chromosomes.

GROUP 19-20 Short chromosomes with approximately median centromeres.
GROUP 21-22 Very short, acrocentric chromosomes. Chromosome 21 has a satellite on its short arm. The Y chromosome is similar to these chromosomes.

in descending order of length, consistent with operational conveniences of identification by other criteria. The sex chromosomes should continue to be referred to as X and Y, rather than by a number, which would be an additional and ultimately, a superfluous appellation.
It was generally agreed that the 22 autosomes can be classified into seven groups, distinction between which can readily be made. Within these groups, further identification of individual chromosomes can in many cases be made relatively easily. Within some groups, especially the group of chromosomes numbered 6-12, including also the X chromosome, the distinctions between the chromosomes are very difficult to make by criteria at present available. However, lesser difficulties are encountered in separating chromosomes 6 and the X from the remainder of this group. It is believed that, with very favourable preparations, distinction can be made between most, if not all, chromosomes.
It is proposed that the autosomes first be ordered by placing the seven groups as nearly as possible in descending order of size. Within each group the chromosomes are arranged, for the most part, by size. It was desired specifically to avoid the implication that size relationships have been permanently decided in every instance, but it is hoped that the assignment of numbers will be permanently fixed. In those cases where distinction is at present doubtful, final definition of each chromosome can be left until further

knowledge has accrued, though an attempt is
made to provide a characterization of each.
These principles make it possible to draw up a
conspectus of the chromosomes, a table of their quantitative characteristics and a table of the synonyms which authors have already published. These are appended (Tables 1, 2 and 3).
In Table 2, showing the diagnostic characters of the chromosomes, three parameters are relied upon. These are: (1) The length of each chromo-
some relative to the total length of a normal,
X-containing, haploid set, i.e., the sum of the lengths of the 22 autosomes and ofthe X chromo-
some, expressed per thousand; (2) The arm ratio of the chromosomes expressed as the length of the longer arm relative to the shorter
one; and (3) The centromeric index expressed as the ratio of the length of the shorter arm to the whole length of the chromosome. The two latter indices are, of course, related algebraically quite
simply, but it is thought useful to present both here. In some chromosomes, the additional criterion of the presence of a satellite is available (Table 1), but in view of the apparent morphological variation of satellites, they and their connecting strands are excluded in computing
the indices. Table 2 shows the range of measurements
determined by various workers. Some of the variation expresses the uncertainty due to measurement of relatively small objects; but many of the discrepancies between different
