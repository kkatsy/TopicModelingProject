Note on Recent Age-Pyramids in Underdeveloped Countries

words of a letter from the Warden of Toynbee
HalI to The Times, May 2nd, 1964: "One certain way to bring about a fall in the birth rate is by a rapid rise in living standards." This doctrine is

"motivations" will really overcome ignorance and carelessness. This note is written to draw

group aged 10-19. The analogy, so comfortably drawn, between a possible automatic birth rate fall in underdeyeloped countries, and the actual fall after 1871 in England is obviously built up
somewhat art-ificially on a very different age
structure.
Is this Pakistan pyramid typical, however, of underdeveldped countries generally? To test this, I referred to all large underdeveloped countries with a population over twenty-five million whose age distributions for 1960 or later are published in thei U.N. Dem'ographic Yearbook for 1963. Besides Pakistan, they comprise Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Mexico.
The age pyramids for these four countries given below as Figures 3 to 6 show the same general form as that for Pakistan. A short test of this similarity is to divide the number of 0-9year-olds by the number in the ten-year group central to the "parent" generation-i.e. the group aged of25-34pt This inter-generation, or "edquarter-century on," ratio was for Pakistan 2i47. The under-ten-year-olds were about twoand-a-half times the number of twenty-five to thirty-five-year-olds. For Mexico in 1960 the ratio was 2p43, for both Thailand and Indonesia

in 1961 it was 2-15 and for the Philippines 2 60.
For England and Wales in 1871 it was only 1-73,
in 1961, only 1P22.
The pyramids differ in certain respects:
Indonesia, for instance, has a particularly ragged outline in its "middle ages." But the pyramids of
all the five underdeveloped countries agree in
showing the bulging basement. The implications of this vast bottom bulge, if I
may use that expression, to future population hardly need stressing. When the 1960 0-9-yearolds become 15-24-year-olds, as they will begin to do in 1966, we may expect a really sharp increase in gross birth rates. Hitherto, the population explosion has not (taking underdeveloped countries as a whole) been due to a rise in birth rates. It has been the result of a steep fall in death rates, particularly infant mortality-a degree of fall with no precedent in the supposed European analogy. Now, however, we shall have to reckon both with a fall in gross death rates, due to a still improving death control and to the younger age structure of the population, AND
with a rise in gross birth rates.
