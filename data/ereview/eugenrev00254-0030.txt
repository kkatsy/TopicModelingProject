views of sex, they are due for disillusion. The best results will follow from sex educa-
tion only when the whole of our society is
remodelled and our children grow up from
the earliest days surrounded by adults who
feel that sex is an excellent and joyous thing in which man and woman join as equal

partners, sharing benefits and responsibilities alike. Meanwhile, our scheme of sex educa-
tion must not be drawn up in vacuo, as if sex attitudes and sex behaviour were things fixed and immutable. If it is to be really potent, it must be sex education for our par-
ticular social setting.

Another is that even local copies of returns for specific areas do not seem to have turned

Derbyshire.t Nor has it so far been possible
to trace any of the special returns concerning the nobility. But in view of the importance of the returns as a possible contribution to the economic and social history of the country, it is clearly most desirable to encourage
a search among central and local archives for the original data.

In their study of the London returns,
Jones and Judges quite rightly express surprise at this method of successive approximation. Taking the I695 returns for the City of
London within the Walls (and making an estimate for the seventeen parishes, the returns for which they were unable to trace), they arrived at a total population of 69,58I. King's first estimate, based on a ratio of 5 4
persons per inhabited house, was 72,900. After allowing for omissions he chose the higher figure of 80,I90, from which he calcu-

number of inhabited houses taken by King (I3,500 instead of the II,469 found by Jones and Judges).* In other words, King finally arrived at a ratio which he could have calculated in the first place by using the assessment returns and without making any allowance for omissions.
The explanation put forward by Jones and Judges is an ingenious one. They suggest that King had made up his mind in advance to estimate the population on the basis of the numbers of houses recorded in the hearth tax returns and that, at the same time, he also had an estimate derived from the marriage, birth and burial assessments. Comparing these two results he may have found that the ratios of persons per inhabited house were " too low for his previously formed estimate " and he thus increased the population by io per cent, with a corresponding rise in his ratios. " The result is a higher population for London in the revised estimate than the factors available to King seem to justify,'' while at the same time the allowance of I0 per cent per persons omitted "gave him the average size of 'household' which we know that he could, and apparently did, extract straight out of the marriage-duty assess-
ments...."t
The error in this explanation is its assumption-and the authors had no basis for a con-

trary belief-that King had access to the complete returns, or at least access to those for London. But -the P.R.O. manuscripts and the Burns journal make it clear that this was not the case. There is little doubt that King himself had hoped to make use of the full material for London, for the P.R.O. manuscripts contain a table entitled: "An Extract of the Number of Houses and People from ye Assesmt. upon Marriages Births and Burials a'. Dni. I695," which lists all the London parishes and has against them a number of ruled columns headed: Houses, People, Quality, Bachelors, Widowers, Yearly Marriages, Yearly Births, Medium of I683 and I684 Yearly Burials, and Ratio of Mortality. It is clear that King intended to enter in these columns the statistics relating to every parish, and it is equally clear that he did not succeed in collecting the data except for a few of them. Table II gives the numbers of houses, population and size of household (King's own calculations) for those parishes, and gives the comparable
statistics derived by Jones and Judges from
the Guildhall records. Comparison shows
a close approximation between the two sets of

able to obtain copies of, or access to, the
original returns. To arrive at a total population for London,
he had thus of necessity to base his estimate
on a series of ratios of persons per house. In fact he used different sets of ratios at different times and he was evidently much concerned with the question of which ratios would be nearest the truth. In most cases he gives no real statistical reason for using the particular set of ratios adopted at the time. But one of the calculations in the Burns journal suggests that, whatever subsequent alterations he may have made, he based himself originally on the information summarized in Table II, for, taking the parishes listed, he arrives at the following results: *
* Burns journal, p.-58. King gives no explanation for
his exclusion, from the above calculation, of data for St. Clement, Eastcheap; St. Gregory by St. Paul's; St. Margaret, New Fish Street; St. Michael Bassishaw; St. Peter, Cornhill; and St. Stephen, Coleman Street. He also refers to the number of houses recorded for St. Katharine's Tower, as being incorrect: " it has not above 6oo houses, They (the Assessors) having reckoned all ye Divided houses or those in which there is 2 or 3

These ratios, derived from the statistics of nineteen of the twenty-five parishes listed in the P.R.O. manuscripts, are very similar
to the first set of Tatios given in Table I, of
the present paper. It would seem, therefore, that the initial set of ratios used by King for London were based upon a sample of. the

The various calculations in the Burns journal appear to date from I695-6 though it is clear that King must have made further entries as late as I700 (see p. 92 of the journal).
t Although this initial set of ratios is quite straightforward, the various sets of secondary, derived, ratios are by no means easy to explain.

data appear to have been much more sparse. They are given in a series of summaries in the Burns journal (pp. 90-2), and the main overall results are reproduced in Table III. The precise way in which King made use of these results in his estimates of the population of cities, market towns, villages
and hamlets is by no means clear. But the
general scheme of calculation is shown-in a number of variations-at several points in
both the P.R.O. and Burns journals. Three examples are given in Table IV. King might have been expected to derive the ratios of
persons per house in the various categories given in the examples from the basic material of Table III. But if he did thisand he must certainly have made some use of the returns in his calculations-the
derivation is not a direct one, and the manuscripts seen so far do not explain what in
fact he did.

The above discussion suggests the kind of problem with which King was faced in
making his estimates. He was in the position, so far as the returns on marriages, births and burials were concerned, of an outside individual-outside the government service
-at a time when statistics of the kind with which he wanted to deal were generally regarded as confidential. He almost certainly had to content himself with such material as he might obtain through influential friends. He knew, at least in part, the limitations ofthe basic data* and of his own calculations derived therefrom, acknowledging that
* He made various estimates of the extent of underenumeration in the assessments, those in the Observations being the most generous, namely io per cent in London, 2 per cent in the other cities, and i per cent in the villages and hamlets. Nevertheless, Robert Harley believed the allowances were insufficient and that, in particular, there was likely to be a greater degree of omission in the country than in London.

figure shows the marked concentration of ages in the second half of each ten-year age group. It also shows the marked underenumeration of male children. King himself comments on this and writes, in a marginal note: " Now ye Births in Lichfd. in all ye 3 parishes being yearly at a medium I07. Whereof for these 286I People [being Exclusive of ye Close of Lichfield and of some out Villages which parish to Lichfield but being without ye Liberties of ye City and County of Lichfd. are not included in this Assessment] The Yearly Births may be about IOO which in 5 years would be 500 whereof a Fifth part dying there should remain about 400; But whereas there is but 368, there seems to be 32 wanting, Either in ye Assesmt. itself, or by reason of ye mortality by ye Small Pox which hapned among ye young children a year or two ago, which appears more plainly by ye Number of Children of i, 2 and 3 years old, Those of I and 2 years being fewer in Number then those of 3, whereas they should be more."*
* Note that King uses the term " Assessment" for this table. It is possible that the additional information

Leaving aside the question of underenumeration at the early ages, the population pyramid shows a situation similar to that in I84I, a period of high mortality and high fertility. It is interesting, therefore, to estimate the fertility of Lichfield in i695. Assuming that King was right and that the annual average of births was about ioo (and this figure is more likely to understate than to overstate the facts), the number of births per I,000 women aged I5 to 49 years would be about I20, as compared with 62 for Lich-
field and 56 .4 for England and Wales in I93I. Relating births to married women in the
same age groups would yield a rate of almost 287 per i,ooo women for Lichfield in I695,
as compared with io6 .7 for England and
Wales in I93i and I24 for Lichfield at the latter date. Marital fertility in I931 was
thus less than half of what it appears to have been in I695. But, on the other hand, the I695 rate appears to be very similar to that
on ages was collected by the assessors in the course of thbir enumeration for the marriage-duty Act. If so, it was a type of information not required by the Act itself.

GREGORY KING AND POPULATION OF ENGLAND AND WALES I83

for England and Wales in the I85o's.* The object of this paper has been to
inquire into the methods and materials used by Gregory King in his work on the population of England and Wales at the end of the seventeenth century. The relevance of the discussion for any new estimates of the population in I695 must be left for later consideration. But so far as the first point is concerned, one fact is abundantly clear: King was a worthy successor to Graunt. Hampered by inability to use the full official data, he showed great imagination in his handling of what was available. Above all, his work demonstrates his awareness of the questions which need to be posed in studying
population trends.t His approach and
* For England and Wales in I850-2 the number of live births per i,ooo married women aged 15-49 years was over 265. Correction for under-registration in the period would raise the figure still higher. The Lichfield data suggest fairly late marriage, but a high marriage probability. Half of the women aged 25-9 years were single, while this was so for only one out of sixty in the age group 45-9 years.
t Some of these questions are posed by him in the P.R.O. journal, p. 8, namely: how many marriages annually; at what ages persons marry; how many widows and widowers; at what ages they become such;

knowledge of his own limitations are perhaps best summed up in a motto which he intended to use in the introduction to an alternative version of the Observations: " Pour bien savoir les Choses, il en faut savoir le detail: mais pource qu'il est presque infiny, nos Connoisances sont toujours superficielles et Imparfaites."*
how many 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th marriages; how many barren marriages; how many teeming women; how many die in cldbed; how many die in labour; how many marriages produce only one child, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, etc. Similar awareness is shown in the Observations, p. 46, where he notes that " from a consideration of the male and female children in the said town, and the ages of their parents, at the time, when such children were respectively conceived, a scheme may be established, of the powers of generation . . ." and one of the draft tables in the P.R.O. journal, p. 21, was designed to do this by relating conceptions to married women at individual ages.
* Since writing the above paper, I have been shown a copy of some comments by the late Professor Henry Higgs, which appear to refer to the Burns journal. Professor Higgs wrote that he had always felt sure that the volume existed but had long searched for it in vain. He was strongly in favour of publication of at least part of its contents. It now seems likely that publication of a fairly wide selection of King's manuscripts will be possible and I hope to preface the selection with a more detailed stuay of the significance of King's contributions to demography.
