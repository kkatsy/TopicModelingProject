THE LAKE OF HAARLEM AS A SETTLEMENT.1
By DR. H. N. TER VEEN.
Settlements have always been looked upon with special interest by everyone concerned with the study of social problems. Colonists are psychologically and physically selected, and settle in a new region, which imposes new conditions of life. As a rule these are rigorous. The whole group of colonists shows qualities hitherto hardly perceptible in the mother-stock.
As a rule we meet with great difficulties in collecting such information, because in the first years of struggle no thought is given to statistics. In this respect the settlement of the Lake of Haarlem makes a happy exception; the study of its social development can be based on a large number of reliable statements, it has a value far beyond its geographical importance.
The Lake of Haarlem is a drained lake, situated between Amsterdam, Haarlem and Leiden. The greater part of Holland is below the level of the sea and has to be protected at great cost against the ocean. As far back as the middle of the last century moreover the many freshwater lakes formed a constant menace. In 1836 the Lake of Haarlem overflowed 11,500 hectares of valuable land. Drainage was resolved upon. This work started in 1848, and was completed in four years: 18, 000 hectares of rich soil had thus been reclaimed; a new settlement had been won for the migratory natives among the Dutch peasant population. Many problems arose of which the most important for the eugenist will now be treated.
By far the greater part of the settlers were in the prime of life. That is an important factor. Professor Kjellen regrets that so many young men leave Sweden; he almost regrets the low Swedish deathrate, whereby the number of old people rises rapidly. ' Comparing the Swedish figures with those for the population of the Lake of Haarlem, we find in the former 21% over fifty years and in the latter (about 1860) not quite 6%!
The families of the first inhabitants of the Lake were numerous considering the low ages of the population. In the province of Noord-Holland the average size of the family was 4 * 59, in the Lake of Haarlem 4*87. Dwellings were bad: most of the settlers lived in miserable huts, of which the walls, plugged with clay in winter, were about 1.5m. high. They slept on straw. The pounded earthen floor had a hole in the middle in which a fire was made. The smoke disappeared by the same opening, which served as an entrance.

212 EUGENICS REVIEW.

Now it is a well-known phenomenon that with immigrants proportionately many degenerate elements occur. Some of them feel more free in the new home, others again are attracted by the romance of the new life. Wherever they meet with no success they show all their
anti-social tendency, for among the factors which develop the criminal predisposition, poverty is one of the most powerful. This was true of
our district. In Parliament the member for Amsterdam opposed the intention
of the Minister to abolish the military police-service in the polder of the Lake of Haarlem "because the inhabitants of that community consist largely of evil men."
Gin drinking was excessive. The polder-boys were ill sometimes for days, on account of their drinking. In the village of Kruisdorp, situated in the middle of the drained area, there was a tavem to be found before a baker's shop. The number of public houses (of which many on the border of the region were prohibited) was much greater than in many other districts. The results were not long in manifesting themselves; poverty, vagabondage and crime abounded. The rough conditions led to much- illegitimacy. The percentage of children born out of wedlock from all the births are:

With little more capital than his strong arms, his physical energy and that of his family, the colonist began the struggle for life. But the land was marshy. In the winter of 1853 to 1854 and 1857 42% of the soil was flooded. The roads were in such a bad condition that agricultural produce often could not be transported to Amsterdam. The struggle for life, already heavy in consequence of the peculiar hydrographic and economic conditions was aggravated.

A comparison with our own times enhances the impression of the appalling conditions in the Lake. "Dying Berlin" in 1918 had a death-rate of 20* 65; "Hungry Prague" 18.0; Amsterdam had in 1918, the fatal year of influenza, a death-rate of 15.54, while in the best year the Lake had 33! A comparison with the death-rate in those days in Noord-Holland points out the Lake as the cemetery of the province. In 1859, 31 persons more died than were born. The infant mortality was almost Russian. In the period 1856-1860 the infant mortalitv amounted to 34*54 of all the deaths. The struggle was too severe for many and these soon left. It is obvious that this shifting population and the enormously high death-rate had a bad effect on the exploitation of the soil.
The following years supply us with surprising figures: over the period 1860-1880 we find the birth-rate consistently very high. In the period between the fourth and the fifth census from 1860-1870 in

THE LAKE OF HAARLEM AS A SETTLEMENT. 213

Amsterdam the average of births calculated per 1,000 inhabitants was 83.50; in Noord-Holland without Amsterdam 38.42; but in the Lake 56.52.
Neither Calvinistic Gelderland nor Roman Catholic Brabant and Limburg are able to show in any of their communities such high figures. Families with eight or more children were no exception. In an account of a festival we read "In the hall festively decorated with kale, behind the clean table of Santa Claus, the baker's wife with her 19 children went to and fro." When at the end of 1879 the sixth census was taken the Lake of Haarlem still led in regard to size of families.

How far the physique of posterity is favourably influenced by selection, it is difficult to decide; those who expect a favourable result from large numbers of children, because all selection presupposes a surplus of material, are opposed by those who deny this. It is certain that those primitive races which artificially reduce the number of their children, never progressed, but the explanation may be a psychological one. Also in regard to intelligence this holds good: large numbers tend to high capacity. The psychological value of the family in general and the large family in particular is still not fully explained. The high birth-rate of the Lake proves that this first condition necessary for economic and social growth had been fulfilled. In our days a large family is regarded as a brake on the struggle upwards. Parents richly blessed with children are looked upon as imprudent fools; in the Lake they are held in respect.
Because the number of men in the new community predominated, marriage was not easy. Many young peasants went to look for their wives outside the Lake. Professor Gallee observes that the peasant
as a rule marries by preference in-his own village, sometimes in the family, generally co-religionists, which must influence posterity. The peasant of the Lake had to break away from this habit. In 15-20% of the marriages which were contracted from 1856-1861 in the Lake of Haarlem, the bride came from outside the community. That fact, added to the circumstance that the first inhabitants had flocked together from many parts of the country is sure to have benefited both the physical, the pyschological qualities of later generations.
The peasant in the Lake of Haarlem distinguishes himself mentally from his compeers elsewhere in our country. Sir William Temple, Fruin, Blok, Menne, both foreigners and Dutch alike, agree
in their opinion about the Dutch peasant offormer times, they praise him as laborious, simple, and steadfast but without a mind for innovations. He was lacking in initiative. The peasant in the Lake of Haarlem was a more independent figure than his brothers elsewhere, keener in the

economic struggle with a touch of initiative. The more intellectual led-the typical revolutionaries, and the rest of the population was mentally able to follow these leaders.
A remarkable English study, little known in Holland, on agrarian conditions there, makes it possible to compare the various parts of
Holland with one another. This study dates from 1880 and is one of the "Reports of the Royal Commission on Agriculture" drawn up by Jenkins, secretary to the "Royal Agricultual Society." Jenkins' study is the result of serious work "with the scapel of an anatomist," as he himself puts it. The peasants of the Lake of Haarlem come first in his appreciation; he praises them, as "the best farmers of the Kingdom. "
THE POLDER To-DAY.

It must be of importance for the eugenist to know the condition
of the polder nowadays. The energy of the colonists proved to be great and the growth of the population was in proportion. The Lake of Haarlem still proves to be an important region for settlement. From 1920 to 1923 included, there settled in this community no less than 5,400 persons. If we trace the place of origin of these people, we
learn (and this is very remarkable), that by far the greater part of the settlers come from the same communities whence also the first colonists came. There is also an outward migration. The demand for hands being very unequally divided over the year, wages are rather low and the work very heavy. The growth of population in the polder is all the more remarkable for the Eugenist, as it is exclusively the result of birth-surplus.
Certainly the birth-rate figure in the Lake of Haarlem decreases;
it decreased from 42 1 in 1881 to 29-2 in 1923. In the list of the European realms the polder would take the 3rd place among the 1T countries, after Roumania and Servia, but before Hungary.

These high figures are now enhanced in the Lake by a remarkably
low death-rate. In the polder, once the cemetery of the province, the

sanitary condition nowadays is as favourable as any in the Netherlands, while in 1922 the death-rate amounted to 11'4 in Holland (per

1,000 of the population) for the Lake this figure was less than 10!

One of the most important social consequences of both factors is

the large family. By the census of 1920 the average size of the family

Thus the study of the development of the population of the polder

yields an important result. Since the days of the first settlement this

population appears as a group, the birth-rate of which far surpasses

that in the country generally. Notwithstanding the hygienic condi-

tions being in some respects less favourable (there is no good drinking

water, the housing still leaves much to be desired), the number of

deaths and that of those still-born is small. Nowhere death reaps less,

nowhere life receives more guests. A somatic group resembling in all

respects the first settlers is established. Evidence of mental vigour is

everywhere noticeable; in economic life the population of the Lake shows symptoms of power, and a spirit of enterprise; the present

generation in this respect also is not behind the first colonists. Their-

agriculture stands first, their horse-breeding is praised everywhere;

their horticulture is full of promise. The psychological character-

istics of the colonists are still present in the generation of to-day. In

no part of the Netherlands (according to experts) are so many agricul tural machines being used as in the Lake of Haarlem; nowhere (Gron-

ingen perhaps excepted) is machinery so generally used. The manifold

use of the tractor is a proof of this. Often on a farm of 40 hectares,

we come across a tractor, an electric thrashing-machine, a corn-andcarraway-mower, a sowing and a weeding-machine and a cultivator,

besides a large number of smaller implements. Some farms are too

small to use a tractor to advantage, but for this too a solution has been found; the tractor with 'hands' is offered for hire and then used.

Formerly steam was the power par excellence in agriculture, now-a-

days electricity is more and more applied. Some years ago the Lake

was electrified, the net has been so strongly strung that it would be

possible to thresh in all the farms by electricity, while a "poleinstallation" enables the travelling wage-earner in every farm, even

if it has no private installation, to make use of electric power.

In some ways this population is distinct from other country people. Practical and sober to a high degree, their strict religious

trend does not prevent their being materialistic in daily life. Thelight-meter registers, nmoreover, that the winter evening is not whiled

away with reading! There are families of prosperous farmers, where in the most expensive month, only two guilders of electric light is used

and the long winter evening is passed by the glimmer of a little lamp of 16 watts. While the current for agricultural purposes in the year 1923 increased 114%, the light current increased only 12%.

Though Calvinists they are by no means conservative.

216 EUGENICS REVIEW.
For the eugenist the conclusions to be drawn from this study are clear-cut and well-defined as rarely in a social study. There are two types of selection at work; firstly the chance of settlement where hard work and uncertain profit are the lure, selects as colonist a type hardy and enterprising, but with few of the finer human qualities-men with the marks of lower grade of social rebels. The exceedingly hard conditions of the polder impose the second selective force-sheer natural selection. The high death-rate eliminates all but the fittest and the resultant population is vigorous in the extreme, but without high intellectual achievement, it appears indeed, without intellectual ambition.
