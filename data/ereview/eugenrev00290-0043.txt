THE GENETICS OF INTELLECT*

By C. C. HURST, Sc.D., Ph.D., F.L.S.

SIXTY-FOUR years have passed since Sir Francis Galton first demonstrated statistically the inheritance of natural
mental ability in his classic work on hereditary genius. His conclusions have since been confirmed and developed statistically by Professor Karl Pearson, Dr. Adams Woods and others. Thirty-three years have passed since Mendel's laws of heredity were rediscovered, but it was only last year that an attempt was made to express the genetics of intellect in terms of a Mendelian formula. This advance was made possible by the remarkable progress made by genetics and experimental psychology during the last decade.
MATERIAL OF THE INVESTIGATION
Two distinct sets of material have been used in the investigation. The first is a series of studies of the natural mental ability of the parents and offspring of 194 Leicestershire families continued through many years. This involved the personal investigation and grading of the general intelligence of 388 parents and their 8I2 offspring. The same families were studied previously by the author in an investigation of the inheritance of eye-colour and other physical characters, and also for the inheritance of musical ability.
The studies were carned out mainly on adults, but a few school children are included in the records. The material includes representative families of various classes and conditions of life in a rural manufacturing and agricultural district in the south-western part of the county.
Since all the local occupations are represented in the material it provides in this respect a sample of the general population of the district. In other respects, however, it can hardly be said to represent

the average population since in choosing families for investigation, large'families of faithful matrons were preferred and every
endeavour was made to include families which contained the highest and lowest grades of intelligence in the district. The
Leicestershire material is distinguished as the " L.F. data." (Table I.)
The second set of material used in the
investigation is the data presented independently by Dr. Adams Woods in I906 in his intellect gradings of the royal families of Europe. This material-distinguished as the " R.F. data " (Table I)-was used for
several cogent reasons. Being restricted to royal families it represents a highly selected population, with a percentage of high grades or an intelligeice index of 32 *6, as compared with the calc-,ilated average 9 4 and the I6*5 of the L.F. data. In this respect Woods's material is genetically unique and to get similar data we should probably have to go back to the times of classical Greece, in which the necessary genetical evidence is difficult to obtain.
In many respects Woods's material is distinct and widely different from my Leicestershire material. The L.F. data represents a relatively constant and narrow range of intelligence with 72-6 per cent. of mediocrity, i6 5 per cent. of high grades, and i0o8 per cent. of low grades. On the other hand the R.F. data represents an
inconstant and extremely wide range of intelligence, with only 48*o per cent. of mediocrity, but with 32 6 per cent. of high grades and 19*3 per cent. of low grades.
Further the R.F. data includes the two highest grades of intelligence, 9 and io, which are altogether absent from the L.F. data,
including 3 9 per cent. of eminent persons and I * 4 per cent. of illustrious genius. Again, the L.F. data are associated with a variable
social environment, i.e. with extremes of poverty and wealth; while the R.F. data

36 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

In the R.F. data a similar scale of grades was used as in the L.F. data, but, the material
being purely historical and beyond personal observation, different grading methods were naturally adopted. For this purpose Woods developed an entirely new method now known as the histriometrical method. According to this method the various adjectives used by biographers, historians, and encyclopadists, concerning any individual, were sorted out and averaged, or moded, to give a definite grading. After various tests against other and more mechanical methods, Woods found that the adjective test proved to be the most

reliable and delicate test of grading the
intellect of historical persons. In the present state of knowledge it is
inevitable that all attempts to grade intellect are imperfect and the results at best can only
be approximate. In a few cases it is highly probable that the gradings are erroneous
through pathological complications, especially in the R.F. data where the higher and lower grades are in several cases closely associated with epilepsy and insanity. Notwithstanding these difficulties, the fact that, as we shall see, these gradings of intellect show a Mendelian inheritance both in the

The 226 parents remain undetermined, owing partly to their small families and partly to the absence of information about their parents. It may be noted that while the presence of a recessive in a family has been taken as evidence of the heterozygosity of the parents, in no case has an approximation to a 3: I or i: I ratio in a family been taken as evidence of the parental constitution even in the largest families.
The results of the genetical tests are shown in Table IV, but before discussing these a brief reference may be made to the data on differential fertility at the foot of Table III. The figures indicate a definite reduction in

family size from NN to nn parents. Thus, where an NN parent is concerned the
average family size is 5 * 2, with an Nn
parent it is 4.7, while with both parents nn the average family size is 3 *2. This association of N with fertility and n with sterility may represent the multiple effect of a pair of genes, thus linking up mediocrity with fertility and variability with sterility. Since both the
high grades and the low grades of intellect are nn, and the typical MG5 carry N, one
would expect to find both the High and Low grades with smaller families than the typical Mediocre grades. Table III shows that this is the case. Thus typical mediocre parents have

grades breeding true (cf. Table VIII), but
there is a remarkable and consistent advance of parents and offspring from low to high
grades with considerable overlapping of grades. As the parental grades increase the
grades of the offspring increase correspondingly. In the two lowest grade matings there are no high grade offspring and in the two highest matings there are no low grade
offspring. The normal frequency curve is approached only in the mediocre matings and in the total results ; elsewhere there is extreme divergence. This divergence from normal frequency in the offspring consistently corresponds with the parental grades and we are forced to the conclusion that heredity is the cause of the disturbance. Confirmation of this is found in Table VI where larger numbers are available in the form of data of mixed low, mediocre, and high matings of recessive parents (nn x nn).
Here we see the same principles at work as

we saw in the more simple selfings, but with
mixed grades and larger numbers and naturally more overlapping. The parental matings are arranged in regular progression from low to high and, with a few minor exceptions, the offspring follow the same progression from low to high. Underneath the grades of
offspring, the parental grades and the numbers of these used, are inserted in brackets. This provides a striking illustration of the influence of the parental grades on the offspring produced, and emphasises the in-
dependent and equal hereditary value of each grade. Tables V and VI together show (a) that the grades are inherited separately and equally; and (b) that the higher grades are the result of dominant accumulations of
increaser factors which are less in number in
the lower grades. It is important to note that the data
shown in Tables V and VI are all the results of recessive nn x nn matings, and that the

whole data shown in Table I give a different
end result owing to the action of the dominant NN and Nn genes, which obscure the normal segregations of the high, mediocre, and low grades found in the recessives nn.
It is now possible to construct a genetical formula for intellect on the lines given above.
On this scheme 729 genotypes are con-
cerned in the genetics of the eleven grades of intellect; but since the minor modifiers only act on the recessive nn genes (the N gene acting as a suppressor or inhibitor of the modifiers) this reduces the number of functional genotypes to 243. These produce
seven kinds of effective gametes, i.e. one gamete for each class of the cumulative increasers n (I to 5), one for the n(o) class in which the dominant increasers are absent, and one for the N class of gamete in which the action of the modifiers is inhibited or suppressed. Table VII shows examples of

the formula of each grade with genotypes and gametes produced. Table VIII gives a prediction table of the results expected in
selfing the grades. From this table of selfings the results
expected from the intermating of any of the grades can be calculated.
It will be observed that two of the grades-
o and IO-always breed true, but since grade o is hardly capable of breeding and grade io is so rare that no selfings are on record, it is difficult to test this. Of the other grades, I, 3, 7, and 9 are permanently heterozygous and can never breed true, while on the other hand grades 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 may be homozygous and can breed true. In the L. F. families, 14 true-breeding genotypes of grades 4 and 5 have been found. It will be noted that 5
out of the I5 genotypes of grades 2 and
8 breed true and io of the 45 genotypes of grades 4 and 6 breed true. None of the nn

TABLE VII GENETICAL FORMULA FOR INTELLECT [Nn+ (Aa+Bb+Cc+Dd+Ee)] with 729 genotypes. N and n are a major pair of genes for Typical and Atypical Intellect. Dominant N (NN or Nn) determines Typical Mediocre Intellect of Grade 5. Recessive nn determines Atypical Intellect of various grades o to io. Aa to Ee are minor pairs of modifying genes which produce grades o to io. Dominant Modifiers A to E act as equal and cumulative increasers of grades. Recessive modifiers a to e act as decreasers. With nn the modifiers are fully active. With NN the modifiers are totally inactive.
With Nn the modifiers are inactive or only partially active. Thus the 729 genotypes produce seven kinds of effective gametes.

CORRIESPONDENCIE WITH L.F. AND R.F. DATA
NOTE: 6 of the possible II grade selfings occur in 26 families. There are no exceptions in 115 offspring grade ranges. Grade modes and averages are close to expected, but numbers are insufficient. Of the 16 genotypes expected in the 6 selfings io have been found, 5 of which are definitely established by large numbers.
In the mixed grade matings the grade ranges, modes, and averages are close to expectation. In 1194 families with 812 offspring (L.F. data) there was only one exception to the grade ranges expected, where a grade 2 appeared instead of a grade 3. In the R.F. data there were 30 range exceptions in 212 families with 55 offspring or 5.-3
per cent.

R.F. data, 5 of which are definitely estab-
lished by large numbers. In the R.F. data the exceptions to the
grade ranges are more frequent, there being 27 exceptions in the tested families and 3 in the undetermined families, making 30 in all out of a total of 2I2 families and 558 offspring, or 5 3 per cent. Since 2o of these exceptions occur in 7 families and I2 of these in 3 families, it seems highly probable that the exceptions are due to errors in

grading. Woods's gradings have been taken as they stand, and no attempts have been made to amend them critically. In several cases the gradings are dubious through printer's errors, and there seems to be some
doubt whether the insane persons graded by Woods can be correctly graded. The 5-3
per cent. exceptions in the R.F. data are therefore hardly significant, except in so far as they may be taken as a measure of the
errors in grading.
