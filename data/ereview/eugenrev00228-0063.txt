Mortality in

Under-Developed Countries

SOME FACTS

IN THE OCTOBER 1960 issue of the REViEw
some particulars were given of death rates at various ages in Great Britain and other in-
dustrially developed countries. It is now the intention to show some demographic material of
the same kind for less well developed areas. Although much ingenious work has been done
in recent years in expressing mortality in terms of single parameters such as crude death rates, adjusted death rates, infantile mortality rates and the like, these necessarily remain rather weak substitutes for rates of mortality computed in
the traditional way at individual ages. Such rates are not often available for the under-developed areas, but some figures taken from the United Nations Demographic Year Book for 1951 and that for 1957, which gave special attention to the subject of mortality, are set out in Table 1. The particulars shown are too scattered in space and time to constitute a representative selection; moreover, they vary in comparability and probably also in reliability; but in contrast with the figures for England and Wales given at the foot they provide a general idea of the gap that remains to be closed between the more and the less developed areas of the world.

Some "expectations of life" are shown Table 2 in order to illustrate the implications the differences in mortality in Table 1. It will
noted that while the countries for which were set out in Table 1 reappear, with additio in Table 2 the dates for which the expectati are available do not correspond very closely the dates of the rates. A broad picture is, ho ever, painted of the disparities in terms of h length of life between different parts of
world. A striking feature of the tables is the reducti
in mortality and increase in longevity shown those cases where particulars for two r
periods can be given, even though the diffe in time is no more than ten years.

The similarity in Table 1 of the rates
Taiwan in 1956 and those for Jamaica in 19
(except at age 0) suggests that the expectations life for Taiwan in 1956 would be of the order in size as those for Jamaica in 1950-

shown in Table 2. The development over decade or more since the period 1936-41 w

thus be as striking as that in Mauritius.
