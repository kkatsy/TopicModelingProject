28 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

these Clinics has been particularly important, but is somewhat reduced during the last year owing to the urgent demand for women in
munitions. The majority of the mothers
coming now stress the urgency of contraception to enable them to carry on with their
munition work for the country. Neverthe-
less, particularly in Cardiff, the number of
childless women who come in order to rectify sterility is surprising in the present war
conditions. The leaflet Some New Concepts and Laws
in Human Biology is available for those who do not realize this aspect of our work and will be sent on application to the Head-

quarters, Mothers' Clinics, io8 Whitfield

Street, London, W.i.

H. V. ROE.

Correction
IN Mr. K. L. Little's article on " Racial Mixture in Great Britain," in the EUGENICS REVIEW for January I942, Table No. VI, " Cathcart Nursery Sample " should be " Cathcart-Murray Sample."
