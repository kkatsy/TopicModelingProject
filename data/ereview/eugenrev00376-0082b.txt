4IO EUGENICS REVIEW

be achieved by measures directed to the environment. We could wish

that the contents of this booklet might be carefully studied by all medical

officers of health and the army of officials called into being by the

Insurance Act.

(2.) The second lecture was originally delivered to the West London

Medico-Chirurgical Society. It is an eloquent plea for the creation of

medical mathematicians and, pending the realisation of that ideal, for an

entente cordiale between the statistician and the public health officer.

Among the topics dwelt on are the influence of natural selection on

man and the inheritance of certain special defects, such as achondroplasia.

Some beautiful plates are reproduced from the " Treasury of Human

Inheritance.'

THIS is a summary of the results reached by various workers in the de-

partments of racial biology and hygiene with the aid of statistical

methods. The article will be of use to many who desire an introduction

to the literature, but the author's knowledge of statistical processes, if

we may judge by his remarks on page 44I with respect to the meaning

of a coefficient of correlation, is somewhat superficial, and safer guides

may be found in this country.

Davenport, CHARLES B., M. D. Eugenics and the Physician. (Reprinted from the " New York Medical Journal," June 8th, I912.)
IN this address, delivered to a medical audience, Dr. Davenport points out the valuable help which physicians might derive from the
systematic study of family traits in their patients, as bearing, for instance,
on individual differences in susceptibility and mode of reaction to infective agents; and he further appeals to medical men to co-operate with students of heredity in accumulating data concerning the inheritance of normal and morbid characters in man. The natural affinity of Mendelian methods to the individualist attitude of medical practice
should secure a sympathetic response to Dr. Davenport's invitation. Though it ought to be well known by this time, it may be worth while to repeat that the Eugenics Record Office at Cold Spring Harbour, New York, will furnish printed schedules for recording such data, and will welcome information with regard to familv histories. Dr. Davenport mentions that he is at present studying the heredity of cleft palate and harelip, and would be glad to receive data hearing thereon.
