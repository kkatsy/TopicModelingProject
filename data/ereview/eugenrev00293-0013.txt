EUGENICS IN AUSTRIA*

1. VITAL STATISTICS

HE Federal State of Austria-accord-
ing to the latest census, taken on
March 22nd, I934-has a population of 6,750,000 persons. Of that number about
2,000,000 live in Vienna and its immediate surroundings. The main figures about the movement of population during the last sixty
years are summarized in the following table:

It is interesting to study the changes in

the birth-rate in the different parts of the

country. This, as may be seen in the follow-

ing table, was in the period I87I-5 higher in

Vienna than in the rest of the country, while

to-day the opposite is the case.

The birth-rate of Vienna is extremely low
-much lower, for instance, than in London or Paris. Only in Berlin is the rate equally low. In Berlin, however, the differential birth-rate has nearly disappeared, while i Vienna it still exists, the birth-rate being much higher in the proletarian parts of the

It must be noted that these are crude rates.
The age composition of the various districts
may show great differences. Nothing can be stated exactly until the results of the last census are published, and that will take
several years. The percentage of illegitimate births is
very high in Austria: in I932 it was 27 per cent. In the provinces Salzburg and Styria about a third of all children are born out of
wedlock; in Carinthia the proportion is
over 42 per cent. ! The difference between the urban and
rural death-rates seems to be much smaller
than exists between the two birth-rates. Infant mortality in Austria was 98 per i,ooo for legitimate and I28 for illegitimate births in I932. In Vienna the corresponding figures were 66 and ii6. Using the method of J. Brownlee I have estimated the expectation of life at birth: it is 55.3 years for males and 59 2 years for females.

2. RESEARCH AND TEACHING
Austria has no centre of eugenic research and teaching; but a number of independent scientists are working in the field of heredity and genetics. Among the most distinguished may be named the botanist Tschermak, one of the rediscoverers of the Mendelian laws, the endocrinologist, Julius Bauer, and the world-famous psychiatrist Wagner-Jauregg. The last-named is chairman of the Society

eugenic importance:

Race mixture is especially marked in Vienna, where there are more than 200,000
Jews, and about the third part of the
remaining population is of Slav-especially
Czech-origin.
The extreme " race theory," which is the foundation of the Nazi doctrine, is against the principles of the Roman Catholic Church. There are no laws in Austria tending towards a racial separation of " Aryans" and Jews.
As Austria has no colonies, colour problems are of no importance.
