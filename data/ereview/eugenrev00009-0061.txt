Differential Marriage

SOME FACTS

AT THE EUGENICS SOCIETY'S Symposium in
1965, Genetic and Environmental Factors in Human Ability, reference was made to differential fertility of various kinds, and it was inquired to what extent its effects might be mitigated or
offset by differential marriage. So far as social class disparities are concerned,
some information is available from most of the recent Censuses of England and Wales. The
occupational analyses prepared by the Registrar

score and a high proportion marrying, the same result is not found in analyses by social class, and one reason for this may lie in the exclusion of the unoccupied.
Generally similar features were disclosed by the 1911 Census figures.
Confirmation from some more modem statistics can be obtained from the 1951 Census data as follows: first, data are available for sDecific occunation grouns. and from these one

General relate to (i) all men, and (ii) married
men, and proportions married can be derived
from these data. The results for 1931 are as
shown in Table 1.
By and large, most occupied men marry and
there is little difference in the ultimate propor-
tions between the social classes, although the
figures for Classes I and V tend to be below
those for the central groups. The highernumbered classes tend to marry earlier than the lower-numbered ones, and this would make the length of the generation shorter. The proportion of unoccupied and retired men married is ultimately only about half as large as for occupied men, one reason being that in many cases the activity or disability that prevents the pursuit of an occupation also renders marriage less likely from a physical and an economic viewpoint. The unoccupied are not, however, treated as a "social class". Whereas, therefore, differentials measured by intelligence test scores show a marked positive correlation between a good

may contrast, say, professional and technical workers on the one hand with unskilled labourers on the other. Here are some typical results:

An alternative approach is as follows: the numbers of men classified by age-group and
social class are available; so are the numbers of all married women who were enumerated with their husbands. The ratios of these married
women to the men can be calculated either (a) in the same age-groups, or (b) taking an age-group for women five years, younger than for men. (The average disparity in age between husbands

and wives lies between 0 and 5 years.) The Finally, Table 5 shows (i) the fertility

There is little evidence here of any marked change in the differentials, although there is a slightly higher series of figures in Class II than in the others, with some falling away in Class V-possibly associated with the inclusion on this occasion of retired men in the calculations, arranged according to the social class of their former occupation. Part of the differences could be due to a varying degree of inappropriateness between the classes in taking husbands and wives as being of equal age. Part also will be due to differential mortality (the higher the social class number, the higher will be the chance of the man being widowed) and other factors.
Assuming the wife five years younger than her husband the results are as follows for two age-
groups:

From Table 5 it will be seen that the effect of differential marriage is to mitigate the incidence of differential fertility within marriage only in a small degree; consequently, wide differentials in general fertility exist in this country. Disappointingly, the position of Social Class I is somewhat set back by lesser and later marriage. (The fertility differentials for younger women are, however, less unfavourable to Class I than those for women aged 4549.)
