Mlurray, J. A., M.D., B.Sc. Cancerous Ancestry and the Incidence of
C ancer in Mice. (Fourth Scientific Report of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund.) London. Taylor and Francis, igir.
THE memoir under review is an attempt to determine statistically whether
mice, the immediate ancestors of which are known to be cancerous, are more liable than others to develop the disease. The method employed is a comparison of the percentage of deaths due to cancer among two classes of mice differing thus in respect to their ancestry. As the incidence of the disease is very different in the two sexes and at different ages, it was thought necessary to divide each of the two classes into groups acording to age and sex, as only groups similar in these respects could fairly be compared. The amount of material available was only sufficient for the satisfactory statistical treatment of the females, and the inquiry was therefore limited to carcinoma of the mamma which is the preponderant form among them. The essential details of the comparison are contained in the table given below, which deals with 340 mice about which it was known that either the mother or one or both grandmothers, or all three, were cancerous, and 223 with cancer in their remote ancestry but not among their mothers and grandmothers. Both classes were bred and kept under similar environmental conditions, and are grouped according to age. The number dealt with in each age group are entered in the upper part of the table, and percentage affected with cancer of the mamma in the middle part, while the difference of the percentages at each age, together with their probable errors, are recorded below

It will be seen that at each age the percentage of mice affected is

higher in the first-named class than in the second. To the difference of

the percentage in the three central age groups significance may be

attached as they are largely in excess of their probable errors, it is

therefore exceedingly unlikely that they are due solely to chance. Not

much weight could be given to the differences in the outer groups if they

were considered separately, but taken in conjunction with the others they

help to justify the author's conclusion, which, however, he refers to as

provisional, "that female mice in whose ancestry cancer of the mamma

has occurred not further back than the grandmothers are distinctly more

liable to develop the disease spontaneously in this organ than those in

whose ancestry cancer is more remote." He goes on to say " the in-

creased liability is probably of the nature of a predisposition of one

particular tissue or organ system to undergo cancerous transformation

under the wear and tear of life."
