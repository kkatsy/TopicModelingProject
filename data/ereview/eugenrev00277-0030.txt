As regards the chief practical purpose of the scale---the diagnosis of dull and defective
children-there seems little question that the new revision is decidedly more efficient than the old. As regards the wording and the ageassignments of the numerous tests that have been retained, the new revision frequently
accepts the modlifications proposed in the
former London version. The principle of
" internal grading," too, which was advocated in this REVIEW, has been far more freely
used- notably, in the vocabulary test.

the mathematical technique has been con.
siderably refined. In the revsed scale, most of the poorer tests that figured in the original
scale (e.g.," Suggestion," " MIonths,'"" Age,"
" Sex," " Surname-") havre silently been
dropped. The newer tests inserted in their place are based on accepted psychological principles; nevertheless those principles
have really been derived more from group
testing than from inldividual examinations.

Consistency Coefficint for Examinees

th-eorders of the rls gr mh more cloS

In the earliest inquiries the persons correlated were the examinees. Binet's method,
as we have seen, merely requires the exaiiner to note whether the child "passes" or
fails." Nevertheless, in preliminary tnals, it is not difficult, with a full record of the child's performance, to, sort the particular tests that have been given to him in order of their apparent difficulty for him, and then compare these orders as obtained from different individuals. As noted in my previous paper, the results with the earliest form of the scale seem decidedly'unfavourable, for the correlations were far from perfect. Binet had'obviously underestimated the extent to which children vary in kind of ability as distinct from anount. Of two children possessing the same general intelligence one may be far better at the memory
tests, another at the manual tests; one may be quick at perception but too impatient to reflect; another may do well at tests of reflective reasoning, but prove as un-
observant as he was unpractical. A formal statistical analysis of the tabulated results disclosed, not only a main "general factor" of intelligence, but also secondary "group
factors" classifying the children into groups
or " types." As the number of children ran to hundreds
and then to thousands, it became impossible to correlate all the individual orders. They were accordingly correlated by batches: for example, by using average orders based on the percentages of failures, we can compare normals with defectives, boys with girls, children from the poorest social classes with
children from the best, and children of one nationality with children of others. The
group-differences are then dliscovered to be much smaller than the indlividual differences.

higher still, namely, 89o. On the other hand
the correlation between nornal children an(d defective was only 849.49
At first sight these coefficients may seeml high; and so they would be, if they were, correlations between tests instead of betwee
persons. Let us therefore examine the orden,

classes), and 211 (between normals and
defectives. On tabulati the discrepancies according to their size and then examinin
the nature of the tests concerned, we can
quickly ascertain what are the-chief causes:
once agaui, the tests are evnly revealing not merely differences in degree: of intell gence, but also differences in mental qualit
