THE KIN OF GENIUS

A Study of the Families of Great Men

By W. T. J. GUN, F.R.Hist.S., F.S.G.

O VER two-thirds of a group of great men of this country have had relatives of distinction. Of the men of
action in this group over three-quarters have had kinsmen themselves recorded in the Dictionary of National Biography, and so have nearly three-quarters of the great thinkers, and well over one-half of the artistic geniuses.
The proportion of men in the street with distinguished relatives is about one in five
hundred.

titles have been altogether omitted, as irrelevant.
Owing to the uncertainty of medi~eval genealogies, I have thought it best to commence with the year 1500; and I end with
the year 0goo, as there are obvious difficul-
ties in extending the list to those now living. No one, therefore, is included whose main achievements took place during the present century.
As the list is based on D.N.B., certain distinguished men of foreign birth are

A.D. I500 to A.D. 1900, but limited to those of British nationality. All consequently appear in our Dictionary of National Biography (hereinafter referred to as D.N.B.), and the table shows how many of these had near relatives who themselves had separate memoirs in D.N.B. (these will be referred to as the D.N.B. relatives).
This test of a separate memoir in D.N.B. is the best that can be taken; it may indeed be of doubtful value in any one case, but when as many as 200 names are considered,
a very fair indication of the real position is obtained.
For the purpose in hand it is, of course,

The list comprises three main divisions,
Leaders of Action, Leaders of Thought, and Leaders of Art, arranged in each case chronologically according to date of birth. These three divisions correspond roughly to three principal spheres of human achievement; the first includes statesmen, generals,
admirals, Empire builders, explorers; the second, scientists, inventors, philosophers, historians; the third, poets, novelists, painters, architects, musical composers, actors. I have not inserted any who made their names solely as commercial men, none seem to be quite outstanding enough for the purpose. Gresham and Rhodes, though

It will be observed that there is in addition a further classification of Predecessors and Successors. It is of special interest to ascertain how far a great man had predecessors of note as compared with successors. In the case of the contemporary relatives, viz., brothers and sisters and the various kinds of cousins, these are placed as predecessors or successors in accordance with whether they were born before or after the

In this connection, it is however to be observed that the last volume of D.N.B. shows a curtailment in insertions as compared with previous issues. Otherwise, I think, Sir George Wolseley, General and K.C.B., and the actors H. B. and Laurence Irving, would have received notices, and Lord Wolseley and Sir Henry Irving would not accordingly have appeared in the table as devoid of D.N.B. relatives.

chance as to whether the father, brother or son of a great man attains distinction.
The main facts of the position as disclosed
by the table may now be summarized. Out of 200 men of the first note, over two-thirds have relatives in D.N.B. Over three-quarters of Leaders of Action have had such relatives, nearly three-quarters of the
Leaders of Thought, and well over one-half
of the Leaders of Art. One-half of the two hundred have had predecessors in D.N.B. The nearer relatives exceed the next group

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

There are four Lord Chancellors, King, Cowper, Brougham, and Cranworth. Among relatives of Leaders of Action may be found John Hawkins, Charles Wesley, Charles and William Napier, Samuel Wilberforce, James Ross, Lady Eastlake, Mrs. Norton, Henry Labouchere, Arthur Balfour, and Austen and Neville Chamberlain; among relatives of Leaders of Thought, Robert Adam, William Hunter, Joanna Baillie, Robert Stephenson, Marc Brunel, John J. Lister, J. A. Symonds, James Mill, W. S. Palgrave, W. B. Maxwell, Maurice Baring, George Trevelyan; among relatives of Leaders of Art, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, John P. Kemble, Edward WV. Lane, Charles Kean, Lord Coleridge, William Richmond, Giles Scott, Thomas Arnold, Mrs. Humphrey Ward, Christina Rossetti.
On the other hand, some of the D.N.B. relatives undoubtedly found their way into that work through the fortune of circumstances only. But after making all allowance for this and the effect of family influence generally, the great majority were unquestionably men and women of ability.
THE REMOTER RELATIVES
It is to be observed that in several cases in the table where the D.N.B. relatives are few in number, several additional names would appear if a degree or two of relationship more remote were admitted. This is notably the case with Dryden, Swift, St. Vincent, Nelson, John Moore, Walter Scott, Byron, Palmerston, Manning, Richmond, and Dufferin.
The intention of this article is to ascertain how far the great men of our own country have sprung from families otherwise of some note. The table will show that it is hardly
necessary for this purpose to examine every case individually, certainly not those, gene-
rally speaking, where more than one D.N.B. relative occurs. In these, some ability in
the family, apart from the central figure,
may clearly be counted as proved. It is proposed, however, in a subsequent
article to give more detailed consideration to
all those cases where no D.N.B. relatives
appear, with some investigation of those

which show only one such relative, with a view to ascertaining whether family ability cannot be traced in many cases where its existence is not at first sight so obvious.
