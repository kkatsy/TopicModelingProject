Group P contains those women who were seriously disturbed psychiatrically, many of whom had attended a psychiatric hospital at intervals for years.

contraceptive advice. He discusses in more detail the practice at the Sloane Hospital, New York.
Here the incidence of therapeutic abortion in the years 1956-60 was 1 in 429 in ward and 1 in 111 in private patients. Only a very small percentage of ward patients received advice at
the hospital contraceptive clinic, while contraceptive advice was easily available to all private
patients. Dr. Hall's conclusions are: "The obstetrician's obligation to provide abortion, sterilization and contraception is inadequately and inequitably met at the moment. The obstetricians of America must individually and collectively review these vital issues in an effort to establish a more uniformly humane birth control ethic."

It is well recognized that the perinatal mortality is now highest in the para-4+ group.
For example, in the National Birthday Trust Survey of 1958 the rate was 50 per 1,000. As has been stated earlier, the percentage of women having a fifth or subsequent maternity (viable child) increases from 7 per cent in the South of England to 12 per cent in the North. It is 16 per cent in Glasgow and Clydeside. The fact that the Aberdeen percentage is slightly less than seven is the result of our determination to
help all mothers to have the number of children they desire and also because we have made a special effort to help those who are least able to look after themselves. In Aberdeen the para-4+ group contributed approximately 9 per cent of
