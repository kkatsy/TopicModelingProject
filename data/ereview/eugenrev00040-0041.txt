TNTELLIGENCE AND FAMILY SIZE 1949-56

O F recent years concern over the danger of declining national intelligence has lessened. No longer do we share the
fears of a certain pre-war investigator that the nation is galloping towards intellectual bankruptcy. The reason is to be found partly
in the results of the Scottish I947 Mental
Survey, and partly in a swing of psychological opinion about the role of heredity in determining intelligence test score.
In a previous investigation,* it was concluded that
part of (though not all) the negative correlation of family size and intelligence test score may be attributed to an environmental influence of the size of family on verbal development, and through it on general mental development. At the same time, in each stage of the investigation it seemed clear that the whole of the negative correlation could not be explained in terms of this environmental influence.
If this is so, then although the danger of a decline in national intelligence is not so immediate as once was feared, the possibility of a slow decline still remains. It may therefore be of interest, in the interval before any further large-scale investigation of this matter, to report a recent check on the continuing existence of this negative correlation in a small but fairly representative eleven-year-old sample, where comparable earlier data are available.t
Much further information would be necessary to interpret these results fully. In particular, it would be of interest to know the mean ages of the parents of the three groups studied, and to see if the social class

distribution of parents at each family size
differed in the separate years. The interval between the tests is, however, too short, and the differences between the results for the three years too slight to justify such extra inquiry at this stage, which should be
regarded only as an interim check on trends.
The previous investigation mentioned above included calculation of mean scores in two intelligence tests for each size of family in the groups of school pupils who were
transferred from primary to secondary schools in Aberdeen in I949 and I950. These transfer groups are not strictly eleven-yearold age-groups, but a large proportion of the pupils fall within the age-group, and the transfer groups are roughly comparable from
year to year. In November I956, when a similar transfer group was tested, their scores in two intelligence tests were again compared with the size of the family to which each pupil belonged. The I949 and I950 groups consist of children born in the immediate pre-war years, while those in the I956 group were born just at the end of the war: the groups may therefore represent a wider contrast than the relatively short interval suggests.
In each year, over 2,000 children were tested with two verbal intelligence tests. The numbers and tests used were: in I949, 2,56I tested on Moray House Tests 39 and 40; in I950, 2,607 tested on MHT 4I and
42; in I956, 2,248 tested on MHT 53 and 54.
These Moray House Tests are timed tests with verbal problems of various kinds. Each year, there was' an interval of one week between the application of the two tests. In the results below, the score from the first
test applied is given as IQ,, and the score
from the second as IQ2.
Because of the way in which tests are standardized, it is not possible to use the

results for evidence on the trend of national intelligence. Each test is standardized separately, and any differences in average score which may be found between different year-groups may only reflect differences in the groups on which the original standardizations were based. However, if the tests are restandardized on the Aberdeen groups to give a mean of 10O and a standard deviation of I5 for each test in each group, it is possible to compare the means at each size of family to see whether differential fertility in the latest group shows any marked differences from that in the earlier groups.
Table i presents in percentage form the distribution of family size in the three groups which were studied.

The results suggest a small increase in the
proportion of families of two and three at the
expense of families of six or more. The difference between the distributions in I950 and I956 is significant on a Chi-Square test
(X= 476, P less than *oi). This trend is
reflected in a decrease in the mean family
size in the complete groups: the mean
family size in I949 was 3'4I; in I950, 3-38;
in I956, 3y05.
In Table 2, mean scores for each family
size have been converted into " standardized scores" as described above-that is, each

test shows an artificially imposed mean of IOO and standard deviation of I5. This makes possible a comparison of the relative mean scores of each family size within the
age-groups.

The results in Table 2 show little difference
between the years, the decrease in mean score with increasing size of family being still clearly evident in I956. The superiority of only children seems to have lessened slightly, and the mean score of children from families of three has dropped below the general mean. These differences, however, are slight, and cannot be assumed to represent a consistent trend. It has been customary to express the relation between test score and family size as a correlation coefficient, though there are certain statistical objections to doing so. Such coefficients are presented in Table 3. The differences between the coefficients in Table 3 are,
however, not significant.
