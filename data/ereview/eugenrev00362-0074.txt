ScienTI has been established to counterbalance the effects of excessive specialisation with which
men of science are often reproached. It publishes articles pertaining to the different branches of
theoretical research from Mathematics to Sociology, all of general interest ; it thus keeps its readers in
touch with the entire movement of contemporaneous science.

SCIENTIA, now in its sixth year, has from the start gained the favour of the scientific world, thanks
to the support which it has had from the most eminent writers of Europe and America. In addition
to articles by its Editors, it has contained papers by MM. Mach, Poincaré, Picard, Tannery, Borel,
Boutroux, Volterra, Levi-Civita, Zeuthen, Arrhenius, George Darwin, Schiaparelli, Celoria, Seeliger,
