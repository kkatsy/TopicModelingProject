By F. W. WARBURTON

H IMMELWEIT (I) found a significant
correlation of -*I33 between size of
family and composite score in four verbal and four non-verbal tests of intelligence for 408 students at the London School

* There are three main versions of the Matrices test:
(i) the I947 series, which takes one hour; (ii) the 1938 series, lasting twenty minutes; and (iii) the 1938 test, untimed. The 1947 version is considerably more difficult than the 1938, so that no direct comparison can be made between marks scored in these tests.
