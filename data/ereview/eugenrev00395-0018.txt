Army Examinations and Heredity.
BY B. S. BRAMWELL.
This paper is an inquiry into the intellectual history of boys entering the Army from Cheltenham College. The investigation has narrow limits inasmuch as the variation in intellectual grade does not probably extend much beyond two of Galton's sixteen classes. On the other hand there is definite grading by means of examination. I have been able to make some comparison of the intellectual standing of the fathers and brothers of the boys so graded. I have also compared the grading of the boys on entering the school with that at leaving as shown by the results of the Army examinations. I have added a few remarks on the effects observed following upon a change of masters.
The source of my information is the school register. The boys who form the subject of investigation entered the school during a period of twenty-six years (1880 to 1905).
As is well known there are several different ways of entering the Army and these ways depend on the boys' capacity to pass examinations at certain ages. These examinations are of different standards. We thus get a grading of intelligence amongst the boys. The cleverer boys pass into Woolwich. After their course there, they are examined and roughly the top third become sappers and the remaining two-thirds gunners. The more ordinary boys pass into Sandhurst. I have not discriminated between the boys who pass into Sandhurst direct and those who go to crammers for their final polish. I have made a separate class of the bovs who pass into Sandhurst and obtain a commission in the Indian Army. My reason for so doing is that while some boys
obtain their commissions in it through taking a high place in the
Sandhurst examinations, others do so through having a family connection with India. In certain cases a clever boy may think it preferable to become an Indian officer rather than a sapper or a gunner, so that this class falls rather outside the regular series. I adduce reasons for believing that no such preference is widely exercised in other cases. Finally we have the case of the duller boys who obtain commissions ihrough the Militia. In this class, however, are certain boys who make up heir mind to enter the Army at an age oo late to sit for the ordinary examinations. I think that the schoolboy reckoning would
be that it takes a vec-y clever fellow to become a sapper and a clever
fellow to become a gunner, a worker but not a brilliant fellow to pass direct into Sandhurst and that any duffer can get into the Army through the Militia.
As to numbers ,I found in the 26 years 114 sappers and 228 gunners, 158 Sandhurst Cadets who went into the Indian Army and 285 other Sandhurst Cadets, and lastly 225 officers who obtained their commission through the Militia. I have not taken into account boys who

passed the Woolwich entrance examination, but who did not proceed there.

PREFERENCE.

Now it may be argued that although the Engineers need higher
intellectual qualities, yet fathers might still prefer their sons to enter
another branch of the service. It is not unnatural to suppose that a
Service father might like to see his son following his own particular Branch of the Service. If we find then a boy becoming a gunner or
going to Sandhurst, is it because he or his father preferred hat career or is it because he was unable to become a sapper? In other words is it choice or necessity? Such evidence as I have, points strongly towards necessity in the majority of cases.
Confining our attention to the period 1890-99 upon which I first
worked, thirty-seven of the boys under consideration had mathematical
entrance scholarships. Of these boys 23 became sappers, 11 became gunners and 3 went to Sandhurst. The scholarship grade is, therefore not very different f om that of the sappers when it i remembered that the se ection of schola s *'s made some years befo e the boys get their
comm:ssions. If then other branches of the Service should be preferred it would appear that scholars are in a position to qualify as sappers,
but to elect anothcr branch. Now of these 37 scholars 14 were the
sons of officers. One, the son of a sapper, went to Sandhurst; five were the sons of gunners. Four of these became sappers and one a gunner. One, a general's son, became a gunner. Three sons of naval officers
all became sappers. Of four sons of other officer , two became sappers and two gunners These cases suggest a preference for the sapper branch whatever the father's branch may have been. Further, among the sappers of this ten year period, there were thirteen who had not been scholars and whose fathers had been officers. Of these, five were
sappers, one a gunner, two naval officers, one a general and four
officers of other branches.
We have therefore 22 cases in which an officer father definitely preferred his son to be a sapper and five cases where he may have preferred another branch of the service. Of these cases, in four the preference, f there was a prefer nce, was in favour of the gunners and yet in only one case of the four was the father -a gunner. In the solitary instance where a scholar son of an officer became an infantryman, the father was a sapper. This is suspicious and one infers that in these five cases the son probably joined another branch of the service because he failed to qualify as a sapper. I think that we may apply the same reasoning to the gunners who were not scholars and whose fa hers had been officers and to most of the sons of officers who passed into Sandhurst and o the sons of officers who obtained their commissions through the Militia; in fact that the kind of commission reflec s faithfully the intellectual ability of the officer, if we consider officers in bulk.
The only exceptional ase is possibly that of Indian officers. Out of 158 fathers of Indian officers 53 were Indian officers and 2S persons holding civil appoin ments in India. It is reasonable to suppose that the sons preferred the Indian Army and that possibly ome could have qualified for Woolwich had they so wished.

ATHLETICS.

An obviou3 criticism which may be made is that some boys work
and others devote themselves to games with the result that their work
-suffers. I was able to get some light on this subject as the Register inserts school colours won by the boys. Calling the winners of school ,colours athletes, I found the following percentages of athletes in the 1010 boys on the list. R.E. 10 per cent., R.A. 14 per cent., Indian Army 16 per cent., Sandhurst 22 per cent., and Militia 14 per cent. At first sight these figures suggest a negative correlation between
-success in work and success in games. One should observe however
that the proportion of athletes is not large. A far more important point is the effect of age at leaving If two boys are of the same age and the same athletic skill, the boy who stays a year longer at school is far more likely to pick up school colours than the boy who leaves. Now the Woolwich boys do leave school at an earlier age. To get
,some idea of how the age factor affects this negative correlation I took
,out the age at leaving of 25 boys at random from each of the five army ,classes and found the following averages; R .E., 17 years 5 months; R .A., 17 years 8 months; Indian Army 18 years; Sandhurst, 18 years 2 months; Militia 17 years 8 months. One concludes that there is a marked correlation between age and the winning of school caps and that any negative correlation between intellectual ability and athletic
achievement if existent is small.
I now insert my first table showing the occupati'ons of the fathers.

ABILITY OF THE FATHERS.
In considering the ability of the fathers, we must have some
standard to which we can refer. What I have sought is some general -standard of success, suggesting ability roughly comparable to that of a sapper. I propose for the purposes of this paper to call it "distinguished," and I have classified fathers as "distinguished" fathers or "other" fathers.
What is the intellectual standard of the average sapper officer? It is undoubtedly below "eminence" as defined by Galton (Grade F.
one in 4,000) though apper officers have been "eminent." I have a moderate amount of comparative evidence from which I conclude that a good sapper would make a wrangler but that the average sapper would not. It falls somewhere in Galton's Grade E. and if we take it as in the lower half of this grade it would come somewhere between 1 in 400 and 1 in 1,000. Let us say then that is the degree of ability which we are to term "distinguished." Now who should be included in the "distinguished" class? If a sapper son is designated distinguished, a sapper father must be so designated. A gunner father is a grade lower. I have only designated him as distinguished, if he rose io the rank of Lt.-Col. or higher. Some people may object to a gunner officer being so placed but it must be remembered that one mark in an examination might divide the lowest sapper from the highest gunner. Further, a cadet qualifying as a sapper might choose to become a gunner. Moreover, there may be cases of late maturing. Other officers starting a grade lower still are only designated as distinguished if they have risen to the rank of general or obtained two decorations; Naval officers if they have risen to the rank of Captain. Indian civilians are all classed ,as distinguished. Amongst professional people Professors, Bishops and High Court Judges rank, but not doctors, parsons, engineers, barristers and solicitors unless one has proof of their distinction. This -is of necessity and may wrong individuals. From lack of information it cannot be helped. I have excluded from my list peers and baronets who were not the original holders of their titles. I have included -three knights and one baronet of whom I know nothing except that they were honoured. If I am mistaken in this, I have overweighted the lower grade3. I have included another baronet and knight without hesitation; both were eminent professional men who had won honorary ,degrees as well as their titles. I am still left with a large residue of fathers whose o2cupation is unknown (32 per cent.). This varies from 16 per cent in respect of the Indian Army, through 25 per cent. in the case of the gunners and 27 per cent. in that of the sappers to 40 per cent. in the case of the Sandhurst class and 43 per cent. in that of the Militia class. What were these fathers? I imagine men of independent means, business men and country gentlemen. One gets an occasional indication in the letters J.P. and D.L. Some may have satisfied our standard of distinction. A man of independent means might be a wrangler and to that extent quite as "distinguished " as an R. E. Subaltern, but as I have no information I must exclude all and I -doubt whether I do much injustice to the relative merits of my classes. A more serious question arose with regard to dates. The register was

460 gUGENICS REVIEW.

published in 1910. Some of the fathers might have achieved "distinction" at a later date by promotion or professional success. Others achieved it automatically by passing an examination in their youth. These latter, sapper officers and Indian civilians, are more prominent in the higher grade, I therefore examined my lists of
."Distinguished" fathers for the period 1890 to 1900, excluding those automat cal 'y "distinguished." I divided each list of sons at the middle and found 24 "distinguished" fathers remained in the earlier halves as against 30 in the later halves of the lists. So apparently this objection is not of much weight except perhaps in the last six years of
the period. I now insert my second table which shows the distribution of
"distinguished" fathers. The percen age of such fathers amongst total fathers varies from 39 per cent. in case of the sappers, through 28 per cent. in the case of the gunners and 32 per cent. in the case of the Indian Army to 19 per cent in that of the Sandhurst class and 14 per
cent in the Militia class.

BROTHERS.
I carried my investigation a stage further by tracing the careers of the brothers of Ahe 50 sappers who had been educated at the schoolduring the years 1890-1899. I also took the first 50 names on mylists of Gunners, Sandhurst Cadets and Officers who had received their commission through the Militia during the same period and hunted out their brothers. I doubt whether my list is exhaustive. If one finds two olumns of Smiths or Jones in an Index, it is hard to exhaust kinship except by vcry diligent plodding. The numbers of brothers of the 50 boys in each of my four classes were, Sapper class 30, Gunner class 31, Sandhurst class 36 and Militia class 40.

I have attempted to grade the 137 brothers in our four classes.
University scholars have been taken as the equal of Sappers. Many -cases are hard to decide. Should Indian Army Officers and Naval
Cadets be graded as in the Gunner class or the Sandhurst class? To obviate this difficulty I have graded each class of brothers optimistically and pessimistically and then taken the mean. All cases where no particulars appear in the register have been placed in the Militia class. Those still at school except the scholar who is graded in the Gunner class, or who left very young or died are neglected. The
figures, of course, cannot be considered as accurate. I think, however, they may be considered as a fair rough approximation and indubitable evidence of a well marked tendency.

My 1010 cases, however, provided me with better material for
estimating the ability of brothers, by simply extracting the brothers therein contained. The diminution of the number of brothers in the
later years is very noticeable. In the period 1880-89 25 per cent. of the boys were brothers; in the period 1890-99 the figure was 17 per cent.; in the period 1900-05 it had fallen to 6.5 per cent. Over the whole
period the figure was 24 per cent. which figure allows for overlapping between the three fractional periods. On the other hand it is not exhaustive as it takes no account of boys outside the period or educated elsewhere. I had three instances of four brothers, fifteen of three brothers and ninety-four of two brothers. There were five cases of twins. There seemed no definite indication that e der or younger
brothers were the more able. I made a note of the elder being more
able in twenty-six cases and a younger brother in twenty-nine cases and
of equality in fifty-six cases. But these points are by the way. I
arranged my cases in a table as described by Dr. Schuster in his work on Oxford Graduates.

PROGRESS AT SCHOOL.
learntLeaving consideration of fathers and brothers, can we
anything from the career of the boys themselves at school? I ook out
Army,.the age and class at entry of 654 boys who ultimately entered the
differentiating ages as far as quarters of a yea'. The school has a.
junior department so one can get a range of ages from ten years up to.

sixteen years. I neglected the few cases which fell outside these limits. I also neglected all boys who first entered the classical side. There was a change of nomenclature in classes in 1889. I therefore neglected the earlier period to make my computation more easy and
my residue from the 1010 cases was 654 as stated. Having got the ages I constructed a scale of classes which the normal boy should enter at the various ages. I did this by entering opposite each age the actual class entered by a large number of boys at that age and then took the mean boy's class. After this it was necessary to adjust slight anomalies. On the whole, however, there was not much difficulty in piecing the scale together though there were one or two doubtful classifications. When one gets such a series as 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, it is
obvious that the first three or the last two is wrong, but which should one correct? Having got my scale I then applied it, classifying every boy as normal, one class above or below, 2 classes above or below, more than 2 classes above or below. We thus get a classification into seven grades which we can compare with the results of the Army examinations occurring on the average, say four years' later. The results of my classification are shewn in the following table.

Ninety-two of these boys became sappers. Now if a eugenist were asked to look at this table and prophesy in general terms, which boys would become sappers four years later, he would probably answer that he would expect to find them in the grades above the normal and that he would expect to find a preponderance of sappers in the highest grade. Practice bears out theory. The three grades above the normal provided 77 per cent. of the sappers and 68 per cent. of the highest grade became sappers. Other broad prophecies of a like nature would be fulfilled.
I append a table of the actual distribution of these grades among our five military classes and two tables of percentage distributions.

There are anomalies but in the main the tables show that the boys do not alter much in intellectual grade. Those that started at a high level ended for the most part at a high level and vice versa. In the last table I have drawn diagonals to cut off in the sapper class, the 1st 2nd, and 3rd grades at entry and so on down to the militia classs whe -e they cut off the 5th, 6th, and 7th grades. These diagonals how that 77 per cent of the sappers were in the Ist, 2nd and 3rd grades at entry, 77 per cent. of the gunners were in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th grades at entry, 79 per cent. of the Indian Officer class were in the 3rd, 4th and 5th grades at entry, 83 per cent. of the Sandhurst class were in the 4th, 5th and 6th grades at entry, and 72 per cent. of the Militia class were in the 5th, 6th and 7th grades at entry. We are left with two triangles; that at the top right hand corner contains the boys who did better than one would have anticipated. It,, hows that 8 per cent. of the boys did rather better and 3 per cent. distinctly better than one would have expected. In the same way that at the bottom left hand corner shows that 9 per cent. of boys did rather worse and 2 per cent. distinctly worse than one would have expected. In broad terms eight boys in ten seem to have progressed normally, one progressed abnormally and one retrogressed, in each case for reasons unknown. This statement does not reflect on the efficacy of the teaching. That must be tested by the amount of progress. Another school might have made sappers of all the first grade at entry. A third school might have failed to make sappers of any of them. It does point however to limitations in the manufacture of silk purses and this brings me on to say a word or two on nurture.
NURTURE.
I find strong evidence on the result o2 variation in teaching. In 1888 there was a change in the Headmaster of the Military and Civil Department. The appointment of Mr. W. M. Baker had a marked effect on the success of the school in the Woolwich examinations, Without attempting to be exhaustive I will enumerate a few illustra-

tive figures. In the Woolwich examination boys are placed in order of merit. In the 20 examinations from 1881 to 1890 no boy from the school was placed first in order of merit. In he 40 examinations from 1891 to 1910 ten boys were so placed. In the first period 75 per cent. of boys passed direct from school and 25 per cent. sought a final assist-

ance f om crammers. In the second period these figures were 92.5 per cent. and 7.5 per cent. In the first period the percentage of successful cadets who became sappers was 21. In the second period it was 38.
Leaving aside the question how far the Woolwich examination

serves its purpose, it is a modest statement to say that preparation for it under Mr. Baker was of the best. Somewhat similar figures might be obtained from the Sandhurst examinations. Leaving he Indian Army out of account, of the boys who entered the school from 1881 to
1890 more boys obtained their commissions th ough the Militia than through Sandhurst in six of the ten years. In the period 1901 to 1905 the Militia boy had nearly disappeared. The following distribution

Sappers have increased, largely at the expense of gunners and Sandhurst Commissions at that of MIlitia Commissions.
I have heard that the College Council were dissastisfied with the
results of the first decade. I imagine that they were much pleased with that of the second. We have therefore a rough indication in these
figures of the difference between satisfactory and unsatisfac:ory teaching. Without labouring the point, 6 per cent. of the total or six-
thirtieths of each of the three lower Army classes appear to have been lifted up one class under the new regime. Another quantitative measure is perhaps this. Normal teaching should provide 33 per cent.
of sappers amongst successful Woolwich candidates. In the period 1881-1890 the school was making 8 per cent. under the normal of sappers. In the period 1901-05 it was making 8 per cent. over the normal. However, very careful enquiry would be necessary before one could dogmatise on these figures. The respective numbers of sappers and gunners may have varied at different times in our period.
Now combining the information in our paragraphs on Progress at School and Nurture, are we not coming very near to grasping the limits of educational possibilities. We have seen in the last paragraph the effect of good educational methods on the boys as a whole. Bearing in mind that these methods were extremely successful, can anyone suggest a system by which the bulk of the boys graded as normal can be raised to sapper standard in four years ? I think not. But do not
many people have vague expectations of much greater achievements in education. And are not such hopes doomed to disappointment?

CONCLUSIONS AND REFLECTIONS.
What conclusions may we draw from these figures? The volume is small, and some of the tables depend on scales and classifications

which are a matter of personal opinion. So the analysis must be regarded as qualitative rather than quantitative.
I think we may safely infer that a greater proportion of the sappers have "distinguished" fathers than the gunners and that a greater proportion of the gunners have "distingu'shed " fathers than the Sandhurst Class and the Sandhurst than the Militia Class.
We may also infer that the brothers of the sappers were perhaps more able than the brothers of the gunners who in turn were certainly more able than the brothers of the Sandhurst Class and that the brothers of the Militia Class were certainly the least able.
We also find that on entering the school the eventual sappers were on the whole distinctly more able than the eventual gunners and so on in succession. The sappers averaged a full class above the gunners. The gunners were a class and a quarter on the average above the Sandhurst officers who were on the average two-thirds of a class above the Militia Officers.
One has tracked these differences down to the age of 13 before the public school education began. One concludes that they are in the main inborn and that even in such a limited range of intellectual compass the effects of heredity are patent. Someone may say, however, "I grant the fathers and brothers were more intelligent and the boys at entry but this merely turns on their private school education and has nothing to do with heredity. Their fathers knew the importance of education and sent them to good schools. " One asks where are these schools with the power to make sappers wholesale out of normal boys. It could not be done at Cheltenham.
And this brings me on to a suggestion that if similar analysis were made by the other chief Woolwich schools they would prove of great comparative interest, but what might prove of greater interest would be an examination of private schools to see when these marked differences in intellectual-standard first become noticeable to the educationist. I think it is clear that it is well before the age of entry to our public schools.
Two questions of a rather different nature may be noticed before concluding. One is "Do the Army Authorities make the best use of the intellectual material at their disposal ?" The Woolwich material appears much the abler. One- has often heard of the numerical restrictions placed on gunners and sappers entering the Staff College. The other question is "Who will be the fathers of future army officers ? " We have seen that about 45 per cent. of the officers were the sons of officers. This can hardly be the case in future. The present Army officer has practically no family. How will this affect our Army?
Finally an apology is due to my readers. I have been very venturesome for one without claims to consideration as an educationist, biologist, or statistician. My excuse is the hope that even my actual shortcomings may stimulate discussion and so further investigation.
