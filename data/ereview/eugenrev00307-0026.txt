AN ORIENTAL ON VITAL STATISTICS
HE head of an Oriental town, a Mohammedan, being asked by the T Government to reply to certain questions relating to his city, sent in the
following paper:
Questions What is the death-rate per i,ooo in your city? Answer: In my city it is the will of Allah that all must die; some die old,
some young. Question: What is the annual number of births? Answer: We don't know; only God can say.
Question : Are the supplies of drinking water sufficient and of good quality? Answer: From the remotest period no one has ever died of thirst. Question: What is the general hygiene condition of your city? Answer: Since Allah sent us Mohammed, his prophet, to purge the world
with fire and sword, there has been great improvement. And now, my lamb of the West, cease your questioning, which can do no good either to you or anyone else.
We gratefully acknowledge this theft from THE LANCRT.
