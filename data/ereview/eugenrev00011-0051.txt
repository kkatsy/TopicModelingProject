NOTES AND MEMORANDA

PRACTICAL HELP
FOR THE HANDICAPPED
GOOD SAMARITAN INDUSTRIES of Western Australia is a business enterprise that gives practical help to the physically handicapped by enabling them to earn a living and be self reliant citizens. Before GSI began operating in 1961, only one of the present staff of forty-five was in employment.
The organization gets a grant of $A3,500 a year from the State Government, but is keeping afloat by its own work. During 1965 GSI had a turnover of nearly $A85,000, of which $A52,300 was paid out in wages. The staff works on a variety of jobs, mostly manual, which include packaging nails, making coin wrappers for banks and putting labels on commodity packages. This is a normal business undertaking; the people put in a normal working day. The only difference is the physical design of the factory: ramps instead of steps, sliding doors and wide corridors to permit easy traffic of wheelchairs.
The morale of the factory employees is said to be exceptionally high, and there is an attitude of pride in the work not to be found in many factories. Some 15 per cent of the staff are under regular medical attention, but absenteeism is remarkably low. GSI is not basically a rehabilitation centre but many of its workers have gained so much in confidence that they have been able to take jobs in other industries.
The board of management was appointed by the Methodist Church and there are no restrictions as to race or religion.
JOURNAL OF
POPULATION STUDIES
WE WELCOME A new journal published by the Institute of Population Problems in Seoul, The Journal of Population Studies. The first 189 pages of the initial issue are in the Korean script with translations into English of the headings to the Tables and Figures, and there is a twenty-eight-page synopsis in English of the main contents. The first issue includes two

Lectures for the Commemoration of the Foundation-one on the direction of population policy relative to the Korean economy, and the other on infant deaths in Korea.
Also included are ten monographs on such subjects as the effect of family planning programmes on the reduction of births, Korean population trends, 1945-64, and projections for 1964-1974, and some suggestions for the 1966 population census.
There is an interesting chronology, starting on 20th March 1964 with a recommendation to the National Assembly for the establishment of an Institute of Population Problems and ending, in December 1965, with the submission of a bill entitled "Law for Protecting Health of Mother and Children and improving the Quality of the Nation." It is hoped to publish this Journal twice a year.
