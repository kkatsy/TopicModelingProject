PRENUPTIAL MEDICAL EXAMINATION IN TURKEY

By DR. NACI SOMERSAN
(Istanbul, Turkey)

A PRENUPTIAL medical examination is now compulsory in Turkey. This measure, so important for the health
of society and the future of the race, was adopted in I925 and became generally acceptable in a short time. The period when
iit was regarded as an irksome obligation is tpast. To-day this examination forms part of the routine formalities which normally
ecede any marriage. Its details are tablished by special regulations, and it is readily submitted to in the villages as in e cities. In this paper will be discussed some of the are important aspects of this examination,
cularly the diseases constituting an stacle to marriage, together with the trictions it imposes on marriage in certain s and the methods of dealing with
itions that constitute a temporary bar marrage. Article I22 of the Law on Public Hygiene worded as follows : "Every man or woman
intends to marry must undergo a
edical examination. The mode and details this examination are fixed by the Board of ealth and Social Assistance."
tacles to Marriage
A candidate for marriage who has undere this examination and found to be free
the diseases proscribed by the law eives a health certificate which must be ed by the Government physician and ched to the marriage record by the istrar of marriages. In cases in which re are health reasons which constitute an Stcle to marriage, this certificate is hporarily or permanently withheld. To
Wte Article 123:
¢'No marriage is permitted to those infected
lhsyphilis, gonorrhea, soft chancre, leprosy

or mental diseases, unless they present a medical certificate stating that all danger of infection is over and that the diseased person has made a complete recovery following a proper course of treatment."
Besides the diseases mentioned in this Article, a special paragraph is devoted to tuberculosis; this will be discussed later.
Venereal diseases other than syphilis may be considered very shortly. They constitute an obstacle to marriage so long as they are not treated. A health certificate can be granted only when their effects, whatever they may be, have totally disappeared. Leprosy and certain mental diseases may be a complete obstacle to marriage, while other mental affections may necessitate a temporary refusal of the medical certificate. In
doubtful cases, examinations by specialists
are recommended.
Venereal diseases
About the registration mechanism in Government Hygiene Bureaus of persons affected with syphilis, there are two facts which must be noted. First, treatment of syphilis as well as of other venereal diseases is compulsory* and free of charge in Government health institutions. Secondly, syphilis is subject to a system of confidential notifications whereby the books in which the names of those affected are recorded and can be kept up to date whether they are' treated in
* Article I03 of the Law of Public Hygiene: " Any
person affected with syphilis, gonorrhoea, or soft chancre, whatever the part of the body affected or the form of
the affection, must be treated by a physician qualified to practise in Turkey. In the case of infected children, the parents, tutors, or guardians (including institutions)
are responsible for having them treated."'
Article 105: " Persons affected with syphilis, gonorrhoea or soft chancre shall be treated free of
charge in all public health institutions, as well as by
Government or municipal doctors."'

262 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

Government institutions or by private practitioners.* Before ratifying a prenuptial medical certificate, the Government physician
must make certain that the name of the applicant is not in his records. If it is, he
must withhold his ratification. For how long? Legally when can a
syphilitic or a former syphilitic be allowed to marry ? When a former syphilitic who has
been examined several times and whose
Wassermann reaction has been negative for a long time comes for a prenuptial medical examination, some of his blood is taken for a new serological examination, and if this examination is also negative, and if he does
not show any clinical signs of infection, the
medical certificate allowing him to marry may be granted. But if, in spite of treatment,
the Wassermann reaction remains positive
the test must be applied once more when the
person desires to marry: if the reaction is still positive, a course of treatment (by means of arsenobensol and mercury) is prescribed. WVhen it is finished marriage is allowed if there are no clinical signs.
In doubtful cases, a marriage licence is
granted only when repeated clinical and
serological examinations (with minimum intervals of fifteen days) are negative. If
they are not, the persons concerned have to
* Article 104 of the Law of Public Hygiene: " At the end of each month all practising doctors must send to the local Government Hygiene Bureau, which transmits it to the Board of Health, a written list of the syphilitic patients whom they have seen. The list must show, with respect to each patient, the age, the period of the disease, and the courses of treatment received. These statements are absolutely confidential, and official employees who divulge them will be considered to have abused their functions and be subject to the penalties laid down for those who have divulged secret documents of the State."
Besides the persons whose names have been confidentially communicated, or who bear manifest marks of syphilis, the following are also recorded: (a) individuals recognized during their military medical examination as having syphilis, (b) parents of children bearing the marks of congenital syphilis, as well as all the children of a family whose first-born was syphilitic, (c) persons whose antecedents suggest syphilis and whose genitals bear a doubtful scar. Except for those suffering from congenital syphilis and their parents, no decision is taken concerning all these people before the BordetWassermann reaction or a substitute for it has been made. The interested party is considered free of syphilis only when two clinical and serological examinations carried out with an interval of a fortnight are negative.

The case of congenital syphilitics as for a marriage health report does not frequently. Still, if anyone presenting manifest signs of congenital syphilis (Hut inson's teeth, ocular and auricular lesie tibial malformations, etc.) asks for a m certificate, he is first made to go through course of treatment suitable for terti syphilis, whatever the result of the Bord Wassermann reaction may be. After the certificate can be granted to him.
In short, besides obligatory and ex tional circumstances, the medical certific permitting marriage can be granted to person previously infected with syphilis o when the Wassermann reaction or a floe tion or precipitate reaction that replaces is negative. In cases where it would impossible to make the serological examna tion on the spot, or to send the blo because of distance, the marriage heal certificate will be granted if the doctor ili convinced that the person concerned has undergone a regular course of treatment and. has not presented any clinical sign of syphilis j for four years. With incompletely treated. patients this must be a five-year period, and: before obtaining the health report they must undergo a fresh course of treatment.
Prescribed treatment for syphilis
As stated above, the treatment of syphilis is free in all the Government public health institutions of Turkey. The methods of prescribing this treatment, the drugs to be used, and their dosage and distribution are all fixed by a special regulation. Needless to say ample margin is left to the doctor in the supervision of the treatment. Its general outline is given below:
For adults in whom the diagnosis of syphilis is confirmed, treatment covers a period of three years, and can be carried on by a private practitioner if the patient wishes. It comprises three courses of treatment with neosalvarsan and mercury during
