Before we can draw *d statistical conclusions from these figures hich are beginning to emerge from our recordg system, we still have to follow up a large

a. Through the partners' intimate knowledge of a good many families.
b. With the help of the health visitors. c. By personal follow-up visits either by our
special (research) secretary or own visits when the time is available.
Thus it may well be another six to nine months fore we are in a position to make valid obsertions on the family pattern of certain diseases. is however, tempting to take a few quick

possible encouragement to others who might be starting to look into family case histories in general practice, we thought it worthwhile to write this short progress report.
Table 1 shows the age/sex distribution of diabetics, epileptics and hypertensives under treatment. The figures in brackets indicate the number of patients with any one of the three conditions having relations within some other separately recorded family in the practice. These figures are given solely as an indication of the extent of the kinship in this practice. The kinship totals in Table 1 are themselves an underestimate as we have not yet investigated all relationships but only recorded relationships apparent to the research secretary.
It is of interest to note how easily the extraction of the figures was accomplished. The figures shown in Table 1 were obtained within three hours from the record books.
The majority of kinship relations in this practice group are of the parent-child and sib type with a substantial but as yet unascertained number of three generation families. One third of the families with epileptic or diabetic members have other related families also within the practice, whilst in hypertensive cases a quarter of

Summary Twenty months of work has achieved nearly
the completion of coding and indexing all civil data for a group practice of six principals. Only one full-time secretarial help was required to build up the basic family recording sheet, whilst the ordinary secretary-receptionists employed in

the partnership were quite able to record a code the clinical material that arose from t
day to day work of the partners. We have now enough experience to say that al
