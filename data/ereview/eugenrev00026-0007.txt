Assortative Matin in Man*

W~THEN THE THEORETICAL foundations
j/j/ofpopulation genetics were worked out
VY in the beginning of this century, hardly
any empirical examples of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium situations were known in man. During the last decades, however, a large number of polymorphisms have been detected. These marker systems, which are almost exclusively confined to biochemical-physiological traits have provided empirical verifications of the existence of Hardy-Weinberg equilibria and random mating in human populations. On the basis of the information collected the view has generally been developed that although slight deviations from pannixia certainly exist in human populations, they are probably of such a low degree that they should not give rise to any detectable rearrangements of the genotype distributions. However, we still have very little knowledge about the occurrence of deviations from random mating in man.
The Historical Background When analysing the family records compiled by Sir Francis Galton, Pearson found a correlation with respect to stature between marriage partners, which encouraged him to undertake the well-known classical study of assortative mating for stature, span and forearm in 1903.14 The correlation coefficients were of a magnitude of about 0.2, the highest being found for stature. In another paper Pearson (anonymously, 1902) discussed the principal effect of assortative mating compared to inbreeding and also gave evidence for the existence of assortative mating for a character such as length of life.
Since these first studies very few workers have been interested in collecting empirical data showing the existence and magnitude of assorta-

tive mating. This fact has been pointed out by Dahlberg.3"4 The theoretical implications of
assortative mating have, however, attracted
several investigators including Wright in 1921 and Dahlberg in 1947.
During the last few years a new interest in problems concerning assortative mating is discernible. Thus, Darlington5'6 has stressed the importance of assortative mating with respect to fertility. We, at the Institute for Medical Genetics in Uppsala, have taken up studies of assortative
mating of which some results will be presented in this communication.
It may be convenient for several reasons to treat separately assortative mating for physical, mental and demographical traits.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

It is interesting to compare these figures with
some data from the Swedish Lapps presented by Elston in 1961.7 For three different anthropo-
metric traits much the same correlation coefficients were found. The nomadic Swedish Lapps constitute a rather small, fairly homogeneous group with little admixture of other race groups. They have a low mean stature and the cephalic index is considerably higher than in Swedes.2
There is no great difference between the three
traits with respect to the correlation coefficients. One would have expected to find a much more pronounced association for a trait like stature than for cephalic index. It is very unlikely that such slight differences of head shape as those here concerned, may be perceived and used as a basis for the selection of the marriage partner. It seems more probable that selection has taken place according to Lappish race type as a whole, so that more typical Lapps mate more
often than chance would indicate.
Not all studies of assortative mating for stature have given statistically significant results. Table 1 also includes data by Furusho (1961),9 who found no conclusive evidence for assorta-
tive mating in a study from Japan. For eye-colour Pearson and Lee'4 reported a
correlation between wives and husbands of 0.10 + 0.04. In a sample from Uppsala Elston7 also found evidence for assortative mating according to eye-colour (Table 2). The indi-

study which was based on the primary data published by Dahlberg and Wahlund2 in 1941, the classifications were also made by means of a fixed scale (Martin). In the Lapps a large number of individuals have brown eyes and very few have clearly blue eyes. The lack of a correlation for eye-colour may in part depend on the fact that most of the individuals in the category of light or mixed eyes actually have rather dark eyes and thus that the variability in respect to eye-colour is less than in the sample of Swedes, which makes discrimination according to eyecolour less efficient in the Lappish group.
The low degree of correlation for eye-colour in the Lapps is, however, still rather surprising in view of the strong association for hair colour found between mates in the same material (Table 4).

Elston in his study of assortative mating in a sample from Uppsala also included different mental traits. He has kindly supplied some unpublished data8 relating to correlation for musicality between wives and husbands (Table 5). The individuals were classified into two

Assortative Mating and Demographic Traits Perhaps the most interesting aspects of assortative mating are those concerning demographic traits, such as length of life, fertility and mobility. As long ago as 1903 Pearson made a study of correlation between husband and wife in respect to length of life. Data were collected from two fairly limited rural districts (Wensleydale and adjacent dales and the villages round Oxford) and one limited class (the Society of Friends). In all three cases a correlation coefficient of about 0.2 was obtained with a mean of

of deleterious genes, for, as Darlington points out, the effect of assortative mating for fertility in consecutive generations is cumulative and hence some families may become extinct in a few generations.
Darlington's statements were based on the
results from the "double-marriage" families only, and no data showing the correlation between mates concerning familial fecundity were presented.
Beckman and Elston' have studied the correlation between wife and husband in respect to familial fecundity as measured by the number of sibs. The individuals were classified into two groups: those who had less than four sibs and those who had four or more. Table 6 seems to

sibship size. When the total material was subdivided according to the year of birth of the individuals, however, it became evident that the correlation between mates concerning sibship size is most likely a "secondary" phenomenon (Table 7). The average number of children has

decreased markedly during the last century. Thus older individuals in this sample have on the
average more sibs than the younger ones. The very strong assortative mating for age has then created the results observed and thus we may not conclude that there exists any sort of selective process (conscious or unconscious) in respect
to the number of sibs of a prospective marriage
partner. Assortative mating for social groups may also create similar "false" correlations since it is a well-known fact that the average number
of children differs between social groups. Most investigators have discussed sources of bias due
to local or class variations, while the variations
by time have mostly been forgotten. As Beckman and Elston' have pointed out, the time trend in respect to average length of life may explain the correlations found by Pearson in 1903 for length of life between wives and husbands, for the data were collected overalong period of time. (Tomb-
stone records were used.) When selecting a very small geographical area to exclude the influence of local variations, it was naturally impossible to find a sufficient number of married couples
from a limited period of time. We may thus conclude that in studies of
assortative mating for demographic traits one is likely to obtain positive results simply because of the time trend existing for most of these characteristics. Most correlation coefficients
have a curious tendency to fall close to 0-2, which is not to be expected since the intensity of selection should be different for various traits. I do not mean to say that a coefficient of 0.2 is what the time trend would give, but it is certainly operating behind many figures. We must then recall that the average stature in Sweden has increased by about 10 centimetres during the last century and thus when collecting data on married couples of different ages we may face the same source of bias as that for number of sibs, which may exaggerate the results. A correlation for stature then automatically gives a correlation for most anthropometric traits.
In my opinion great care has to be exercised
when interpreting data on assortative mating
especially those concerning demographic and
anthropometric traits. Pigmentation characters
(hair and eye-colour) are probably less biased,
