Rapid Falls In Fertility In Recent Years
SOME FACTS

IT SEEMS TO be generally believed that Japan is the only country in which there has been a rapid fall in fertility in recent years. This
is largely true outside Europe, where there has been nothing on a national scale to parallel the Japanese reduction in the birth rate from 30 per thousand in 194549 to 17 per thousand in 1959-61, a drop of 45 per cent.
Some almost equally remarkable developments have, however, been occurring in Eastern

Europe or, more accurately, in most parts of Eastern Europe, since about 1950. The countries that have not shared in this fall are Russia-
much of which, of course, lies outside Europeand East Germany and Albania. But in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Rumania and Yugoslavia some striking diminutions in
the birth rate have taken place in the last ten
years or so, as may be seen from the following figures:

The amounts of the falls are, on the whole, remarkably consistent. The variation in the dates of onset may perhaps be associated with political events and, in particular, with the change from Stalinism to a less repressive regime, though this general trend may not account for

all the differences. They show how potent pressure from the State can be in such countries in influencing demographic events and what dramatic changes can ensue when that pressure is relieved-or replaced by different kinds of
pressure.
These conclusions are in no way weakened by a study of what has happened in Albaniawhere the birth rate has risen from 32 after the Second World War to over 40 to-day-and East
Germany, where there has been a rise from 13 to 17. In the second of these two instances, however, the immediate post-war figure must be re-
garded as being unduly depressed and one should perhaps speak of a steady but low level of fertility in East Germany.
