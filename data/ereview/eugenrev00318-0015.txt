THE LEGALIZATION
OF VOLUNTARY EUGENICAL
STERILIZATION.
By HARRY H. LAUGHLIN, Carnegie Institution of Washington.
1. If eugenical sterilization is to be based primarily on longtime eugenic, rather than on passing economic or other considerations, and is to be protected against abuse, it would seem that the voluntary factor, while it might well be encouraged, should receive some sort of social control. In most of the American laws, this control has been based on the theory that each case of sterilization is wrought with such important consequences to the family and to the state that it is deemed necessary to permit or to demand such an operation only as the result of court procedure. Such procedure involves initiative and investigation by the state; and the order for sterilization is given only after it is found that the particular individual is a potential parent of socially inadequate offspring. In these laws the subject or the subject's family may or may not initiate the procedure, and such persons may or may not acquiesce in its findings and order. Of course, in voluntary cases, the procedure is much simplified. In respect to the voluntary and compulsory elements and to court procedure, the sterilization laws resemble the statutes on commitment of the insane and feebleminded to custodial institutions. In its more fundamental and long-time aspects, sterilization is fully as important as segregation.
2. If the legal right to destroy the reproductive mechanism were given surgeons and physicians on the voluntary and uncontrolled application of individuals, without the limitation of therapeutic or medical necessity, it is probable that the right would, in many cases, be abused. To prevent its coming into vogue, it should, like the destruction of prenatal life through criminal abortion, be regulated by the laws which govern surgical operations, which forbid operations for abortion, except for therapeutic reasons. There needs to be some restraint upon both the individual and the surgeon.

5. State regulation of eugenical sterilization may range, at one extreme, from complete non-regulation, in which case the matter would be entirely one of volition with the individual, to the other extreme, in which the state would take a hand in the matter, and would forbid sexual sterilization by surgical or medical means for ends other than therapeutic, except for eugenical purposes, and then, in each case, only in consequence of a court order which would be preceded by judicial inquiry and expert demonstration of the fact of cacogenic make-up. In the more rigid control, the state provides proper executive and judicial authority and mandatory procedure. It provides also appropriate punishment in case of violation of the law.
6. The question arises whether, between these two extremes, there might not be a medium policy which would permit, but would not compel, eugenical sterilization under certain cacogenic conditions, not necessarily demonstrated by court procedure, but made ,evident by certain less rigid procedure. In such latter cases, the legal initiative would, of course, rest with the individual whom it is proposed to sterilize, or with the family or guardian of such person. Even in such cases it would seem that there should be some safeguard, in simplified procedure required by law, which would minimize any possible abuse of the policy, and which would legalize sexual sterilization only after the application of certain criteria of eugenical benefit. The purpose of such a law would be to authorize and to'enable the sexual sterilization of persons proven cacogenic, and would thus tend to prevent reproduction of persons potentially inadequate or defective. At the same time the law should prevent the sterilization of persons who possess hereditary qualities which are of value in the citizenry of the state.
In the regulation of voluntary eugenical sterilization, three steps might well be required by law:
First: a statement duly signed and sworn by the particular subject, or, if the latter is under age or incompetent, by the subject's parent or guardian, to the effect that it is the belief of the person making the statement that the particular subject possesses hereditary qualities, the propagation of which would tend to lower the inborn hereditary standards of the nation.
Second: before such surgeon would be legally authorized to proceed with the operation, he should be in possession of a second paper duly signed and sworn by a licensed physician, or by a trained biologist with a degree of M.S., D.Sc., or Ph.D., to the effect that the signer, having investigated the hereditary qualities of the particular subject, has found that such subject possesses hereditary qualities, the propagation of which would, in the opinion of the signer, tend to 'lower the inborn hereditary standards of the nation. In possession of these two statements, the surgeon would be permitted to proceed with the actual operation for sexual sterilization.
The third paper should be the return of the surgeon. It should be properly signed and sworn, and should state the nature and date of the
,operation, should name the person on whom it was performed, and should state the surgical and physiological outcome of the operation.

The surgeon should be required to file these three papers with the Registrar of Vital Statistics, or other specifically named officer.

7. DRAFT OF PROPOSED STATUTE PROVIDING FOR VOLUNTARY EUGENICAL STERILIZATION.

With the view to establishing the legal status of voluntary eugeni-

cal sterilization, to assure its direction along eugenical lines, and to

prevent its abuse, the following draft of this portion of a eugenical

sterilization statute (which, of course, would have to be recast to fit

the legislative practice of the particular state or nation) is suggested:

Section 1. The sexual sterilization of persons by surgical or medical means is

hereby prohibited except (a) for therapeutic purposes, as governed by the laws of

f.o.r..e.u.g.e.n.i.c.a.l..p.u.r.p.o.s.e.s.

m.i.n reference to
in accordance with

medical and surgical practice, or (b) the procedure in voluntary eugenical

sterilization as herein prescribed.

Section 2. The voluntary eugenical sterilization of any person shall be author-

ized by the state of .....................

, provided that each proposed

case be initiated and executed in accordance with the three provisions as follows:

Provision 1. Procedure in each case of voluntary eugenical sterilization shall be initiated by the subject, if the latter is of sound mind and over eighteen years of age, or by the subject's parent or guardian if the subject is under eighteen years of age, or, regardless of age, is of unsound mind, provided that such initiation shall take the form of a duly signed and sworn statement that the initiator believes that the hereditary qualities of the particular subject are such that reproduction by the particular subject would tend to lower the hereditary standards of the nation.

Provision 2. In addition to such statement by the subject, or the subjcct's parent of guardian, there shall be required a second statement duly signed and sworn by a duly licensed physician, or by a biologist with a degree of M.S., D.Sc., or Ph.D., to the effect that such expert has investigated the individual and family histories of the particular subject, and has found that, in his opinion, reproduction by the particular subject would tend to lower the hereditary standards of the nation, provided that such opinion shall be accompanied by a digest of the evidence

upon which such opinion is based. In the possession of these two statements, it shall be lawful for any duly licensed surgeon to proceed with the specifically named sexually sterilizing operation on the particular subject, at the time and place and in the manner directed by the initiator.

Provision 3. After the performance of each such operation, the surgeon who performs it shall, within thirty days, file with the Registrar of Vital Statistics (or other officer) the two swom statements herein required, under which he made the operation; and in addition, said surgeon shall file with the said Registrar of Vital Statistics (or other officer), a statement duly signed and swom by the said surgeon, in which he shall name the person on whom the operation was performed, shall describe the nature of the operation, shall give its date and place, and shall state

its surgical and physiological outcome.

Section 3. Any surgeon or other person who shall perform or attempt to perform an operation of sexual sterilization on any person, except as herein provided, shall be guilty of felony (or misdemeanor) and, upon conviction therefor, shall be punished by a fine of not more than ...... ........ pounds, or imprisonment for not more than ............ months, or both; provided that any surgeon or other person who shall perform or attempt to perform an operation of sexual sterilization as herein contemplated, and who, within thirtydays thereof, fails to file with the Registrar of Vital Statistics of ............... (or other officer) the three duly signed and sworn papers herein provided, to wit (1) the consent of the subject or of the subject's parent or guardian, (2) the opinion of the expert on the
matter of hereditary inadequacy, and (8) the return of the surgeon in reference to the fact and outcome of the operation, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction therefor, shall be punished by a fine of not more than .... .. pounds, or imprisonment of not more than ...... ...... months, or both; pro-
vided that any.person not a duly licensed surgeon who shall cause or attempt to cause the sexua sterilization of apy person shall. be. guilty of atternpting to practice surgery without a license.
