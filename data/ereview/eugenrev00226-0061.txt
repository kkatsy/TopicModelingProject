THE EUGENICS REVIEW

The comparative table of occupations is of even more interest to eugenists. The following approximate percentages relate to 76,000 persons who emigrated during 1958 and 47,000 who immigrated in the same year (all Commonwealth citizens).
Once again, the figures for emigrants and immigrants are remarkably similar, although as the groups are broad ones the status or degree of skill in the activity does not appear. The Report gives some figures for specific professions which show that net losses during 1958 included over 1,000 teachers, 500 doctors, 1,300 nurses and 600 engineers and scientists.
