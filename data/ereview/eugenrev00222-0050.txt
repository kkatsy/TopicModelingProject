European Population Contrasts

equalled by those of France and of Italy before the end of the century. This may therefore be an appropriate moment for a short survey of recent European population trends. Attention is directed to Western Europe, which for convenience has been regarded as consisting of the "Six" of the European Customs Union and the "Outer Seven" of which Great Britain is the mainstay.
The latest population estimates and the percentage growth over the last ten years are as

A substantial part of the high growth rate of
Western Germany is attributable to immigration, and the same would seem to be true of Luxem-
bourg and Switzerland. Most of the other residual differences are small, and probably not of much significance, although there appears to have been some emigration from Portugal and Italy and immigration into France.
