CREATED HE THEM

If you have an opinion on population stabilisation, if you have an
opinion on Birth Control, if you have an opinion on Euthanasia, if
you are a Roman Catholic—or if you hold an opinion on Roman
Catholic doctrine, then you must read Philip Gribble’s candid and

biting new novel of intimate personal conflicts in married life.
Outspoken, penetrating, CREATED HE THEM is at your local
bookshop now.

CREATED HE THEM Philip Gribble 21s

IN THIS PASSIONATE and outspoken novel
dedicated ‘To Humanity,’ Mr. Philip Gribble,
deals with the related subjects of birth control, and euthanasia believing that man, in
his maturity, has the right and duty to control both.

The story centres on a young married
couple torn between their duty to the Church
and the physical expression of their love for
each other. Dialectical argument covers the
population explosion, birth control by various methods, (including the ‘pill’, ‘rhythm’,
‘I do better than the rabbits, you see, because
they know nothing about rhythm’ says his
heroine), termination of pregnancy and,
finally, voluntary euthanasia in cases of
incurable illness.

This is an attack on ‘cant’ by a man
who sincerely believes that man’s salvation
lies in his having the courage to follow
the dictates of his own innate goodness.

He believes in the word GOOD. ‘That
is my God. I know what GOOD is. I
recognise GOOD and I doubt if there is a
single sane human alive who does not
instinctively recognise GOOD.’ The final
chapters relate the feelings and reasonings
of a man who, so logically and rightly
in the face of incurable illness. desires
his own death. ‘Could it be right that
the old should live on in dread under the
shadows of the experience of some last disorder, maybe prolonged, maybe painful,
maybe a disorder far worse than death?
Why not accept that this inevitable end
should be chosen.’

It is hoped that this controversial novel
will be widely read and discussed and that
Mr. Gribble will succeed in his passionate
desire to bring happiness and fulfilment to
all who have the insight and courage to
move forward. From the Publisher, May 1967.
