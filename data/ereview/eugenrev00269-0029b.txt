Birth Control Federation of America
THE Birth Control Federation of America recently celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary. Fellows and Members will be interested to hear that a congratulatory telegram was sent to Mrs. Sanger by Lord Horder on behalf of the Eugenics Society.
Family Planning Association
MANY of the clinics run by branches of the Association report an increase in the number of their patienits due to war conditions and in some cases, were more funds available, their Committees would increase the number of Clinic Sessions to relieve the strain on doctors and workers.

A special Sub-Committee of the Association is at present preparing a scheme by which it is hoped to collect clinical statistics of the relative efficiency of certain chemical contraceptives. There is, in particular, special need for evidence as to whether Volpar (the contraceptive discovered by Dr. J. R. Baker and Dr. H. M. Carleton, when they were working for the Birth Control Investigation Comnnnittee) is as efficient in clinic practice as laboratory tests both in this country and the U.S.A. would lead one to expect.

Correction
WE regret the omission of a word in the report of Mr. Jackson Burrows's paper on the Prevention of Crippling in the October I94I issue of the REVIEW. On page 83, column 2, the third line should read " for non-tuberculous adult cripples, unless desti-
tute."
