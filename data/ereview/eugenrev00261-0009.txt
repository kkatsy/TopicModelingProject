THE SIZE OF FAMILY OF THE BUSINESS, PROFESSIONAL AND TITLED CLASSES
By A. SPENCER PATERSON, M.A., M.D., F.R.C.P.(Ed.)

N OW that the country is awakening
to the seriousness of the falling birth
rate, many theories have been pro-
pounded to explain how such a situation has come about. Professor Carr-Saunders, however, has said that before any population policy can be framed, a search must be made for more facts. It is with the object of making a modest contribution to such knowledge that I have ventured to present this paper, which is based on an analysis of over 4,500 biographies taken from Who's Who, I940, the volume which gives conditions in the last year of peace.
The psychiatrist is interested in that aspect of eugenic-s which is concerned with the limiting of unhealthy stocks, and I had the privilege of addressing the Society on this subject eleven years ago, the lecture being based on some thousands of mental patients in London hospitals. When, however, the psychiatrist turns in some dismay from the prolific pedigrees of stocks burdened with
severe mental or nervous diseases, he is confronted with healthy young professional men in his private practice who tell him that in their occupation marriage has become an affair almost of middle life-that they are encouraged to live a monastic existence till the age of 33, or even much later. In some occupations young men are even asked to sign a declaration that they will not marry for some years. There seemed to be something radically wrong in discouraging men from living an emotional life appropriate to their years, and in urging them to prolong indefinitely the uncomfortable emotional life of adolescence. No one, however, seemed to know what the actual facts of family life were in the upper classes, and so it occurred to me that one might analyse a large number of biographies from Who's Who. By further

utilising such volumes as Crockford's Clerical Directory, the Law List, the Medical Directory, Who's Who in the Theatre, the Directory of Directors and Whitaker's Almanack, one
was able to obtain a fairly large sample from the various occupations. I have been fortunate enough to interest some students
and others sufficiently to secure their
coIlaboration in this study, and to them I
am very grateful.
-A study of " successful " men is of interest
because they include those whose example
and precept help to form public opinion. Contrary to the view that "he travels the furthest who travels alone," men who are " successful " enough to appear in Who's Who probably have an average size of family larger than their less successful colleagues. It is hoped to substantiate this by a com-
parison of the present sample with their " less successful " colleagues and contem-
poraries as far as the general census material
allows such a comparison. In the U.S.A. the
graduates of Harvard and Princeton (see Osborn, I940), who were considered to have been the most successful had about twice
as many children as the " least successful." It is, therefore, likely that those men included in the present series had more children than their less successful colleagues. It may be noticed that the number of children is that of surviving children only. In this connection a study of Cattell is of interest, which shows that only 2 per cent of professional men's children fail to reach
maturity (see Rumney, J., I936). With regard to the reliability of the
entries, the editors send out questionnaires every year for alterations and additions. It is very unlikely that many omissions of children occurred, especially as other details, such as the wife's name, are given in nearly every case. It is also unlikely that those whose life work was spent abroad failed to

However, I desired to deal with the genera-

tion just preceding the war. Nearly all these

men were over 50, but I included those under

50 who had been married twelve or more

years. The number of children omitted must

therefore be very small. If any error of

sampling was present, this would not matter

much because the same criteria were used

between the various groups. In any case, it

will be seen from Table I that the mean age in I940 of each group was between 6o and 70.

i. The first problem was to find out

whether the type of occupation influenced

the size of the family for the different groups

examined.

2. There was also the question of whether

those whose work took them abroad had

fewer children.

3. Age on marriage. The question arose

whether those who marry early have more

children on the average than those who marry

late, or similarly whether those with 4 and 5 children marry on the average at an earlier

age than those with o, i or 2 children.

4. Tests were made to see whether those who had had a relatively expensive education, that is, at a public school or Oxford or Cambridge, had a larger size of family than those who had been educated elsewhere. In other words, is the man with the old school tie more of a family man than the others. A
special investigation was also made at a leading public school to ascertain whether its
pupils came from families which were smaller than others in the same social group.
5. Next, one examined data concerning the wife, whether access of income from her side added to the number of children. In
most cases the name of the wife's father was given, and those men whose father-in-law's occupation or distinguished address indicated
wealth were separated out from those whose fathers-in-law were not mentioned other
than by name.
The size of family of men who married university graduates was also examined, while another study was of peers who married
commoners.
6. One then tried to discover if degrees of success hindered or favoured the production of children. We have already seen that
those who were successful enough to appear in Who's Who possibly had larger families than the professions as a whole, but a further in-
vestigation was made of those who were the most successful in their profession, Admirals versus Commanders in the Navy and Generals
versus Colonels in the Army. In civilian life a knighthood in Medicine or the Civil Service, Bishops, Royal Academicians, Fellows of the
Royal Society and Fellows of the British Academy, were also separated out and
compared to their less successful colleagues. 7. Another problem was whether religious
belief influenced size of family. Those of the Roman Catholic and Jewish faiths were therefore examined.
8. Again, a special study was made of Conservative and Labour Members of Parliament. If they were family men themselves, they would possibly be more sympathetic to legislation designed to help parents.
It should be noted that each of these tests was carried out independently from the others, and it is, of course, possible that any

5. The Successful Man's Wife
In the present study it was not possible to elicit the age of the wife on marriage. It is
known, however, that foy the nation as a
whole the wife is, on the average, about one year younger than her husband and it is
unlikely, except where the man marries late, that there is very much more difference than this in the present series. An attempt was made to separate those who had married into families where the occupation or distinguished address of the father-in-law
suggested that there was considerable unearned income which might help to increase the size of the young family. A careful study was made of this in the medical profession, but there was no significant difference in the number of children between those who
married into such families and those who did not. This applied to all the sub-groups, which were separated out to avoid the results being biased by other factors, public school men, non-public school men, those marrying before 30 or after. 30, those at home and those in the medical services. The findings, however, are vitiated by the difficulty of distinguishing between those who really were rich and those who were not.

6. Success and Size of Family
As already stated, it would appear probable that in the professions, those who are successful enough to appear in Who's Who have an average size of family which is larger than those who do not appear.

The differences in the Army between those above the rank of Brigadier and those below are barely significant, as also in the Church the difference between Bishops and the rest.
This correlation between success and larger size of family may to some extent be due to the money factor. Thus high ranking officers in the Navy were earning larger incomes at an early age than the less successful. Again, both in the Navy and elsewhere, a large unearned income might be an aid to professional success as well as an aid to having a large family.
With regard to the aristocracy of intellect, neither Science as represented by the Royal Society nor Scholarship as represented by the British Academy are keeping up their numbers. Two hundred and eight of the former had only I175 children apiece, and
the latter a mere i69.
7. Religious Belief
Twenty aristocrats educated at Roman Catholic schools had the largest families of any group, averaging 3*I apiece, compared with 2 3 for the other aristocrats. This result, however, was not significant judged by the x2 test. There was no apparent difference between Jews and the others from the small numbers examined.
The Legislature
It seemed likely that men who had goodsized families themselves would be more sympathetic to legislation which would encourage the youth of the nation to found families also. We have already seen that the peerage have an average size of family
of 2.43. 'They are the most fertile section
next to the industrialists. The House of Lords has already debated the issue in the most statesmanlike manner, as recently reported in the EUGENICS REVIEW (July I943).
A study was also made of 306 Conservative Members of Parliament. These were found
to have an average family of i *98 children,

while 133 Labour Members of Parliament had an average family of I44 children. As a number of these, however, gave very little information about themselves, they may have omitted to mention their children. One of them had I3 children, the largest number recorded.
DISCUSSION
I. The Problem of Quantity
The results of the present study amply support the conclusions of Dr. G. F. MacCleary (I937), who writes: "By the use of Kuczynski's methods it has been demonstrated that if fertility and mortality in this country remain at their present level, or change as recent experience suggests that they are likely to change, we are doomed to extinction." Or to quote the Official Historian to the Home Office of the Social Services in war-time, Mr. R. M. Titmuss (1942): "Assuming the continuance of present trends, our population will ultimately diminish by one quarter in each generation. The war may make this position even more serious because if a fall similar to that of I9I4-I8 occurs and there is no change in the attitude to parenthood, then we shall be on our way to halving our population every generation:"
Intellectual background of the falling birth rate. It is a remarkable fact that in the upper classes marriage as an institution for keeping up the population has signally failed. It is therefore worth while to inquire what the intellectual outlook was of the generation which allowed this to come about.
We have already seen that in I874 matters were satisfactory, the average size of family being about 5, but despite the fact that a high birth rate was necessary for our prosperity and even for our survival, some sociologists repeatedly attacked the large family. John Stuart Mill had already written, " Little is to be expected in morality until the producing of large families is regarded with the same feelings as drunkenness or any other physical excess" (see Carr-Saunders, I922). Cotter Morison wrote of " the devastating torrent of children." Havelock Ellis stated that the falling birth

68 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

rate was not a national danger and that the
day of the large family was over.
Drysdale (19I3), in his book The Small Family System, rightly spQke of the need to
limit unhealthy stocks, but he used argu-
ments in favour of the small family which
are still heard, but which have been proved
to be wholly fallacious. He thought that a fall in the birth rate would lessen the chances
of war, yet the German Press before the war
repeatedly used our falling birth rate as an
argument that we were degenerate and
unable to defend ourselves. Drysdale also stated in his book that the
falling birth rate would be counteracted by the falling death rate, a thesis which we now
know to be totally wrong. He even wrote as
follows: "It is difficult to find words
adequate to deal with the attempt of the medical profession to stem the tide of the
declining birth rate." In I9I3 the falling birth rate in the pro-
fessional classes could be viewed with relative calm because there was always a surplus from the artisan and other classes to take the place of the unborn casualties. Now, however, the campaign against children has been so successful that their place can only be taken by immigrants from other countries.
The two deliberate methods of limitationLate Marriage and the Misuse of Contracep-
tion i. Late Marriage. It should be clearly
understood that in a society where artificial contraception is not used and where there is an average family of 5, any stock which is seen to die out is either doing so because of physical disease or else because social conditions, such as famine or slavery, prevent reproduction. In such cases demographers speak of infecundity and of infertility. This seems to imply that the causes are physical, or at least beyond the control of society. In present-day. Britain, however, the fall in the birth rate is the result of deliberate choice. It has been brought about by the setting up of two institutions, namely, late marriage and artificial contraception.
It is, therefore, misleading to refer to sterile stocks. It is preferable to speak of the shunning or fear of children as tecnophobia.

It is convenient to describe persons or tendencies which do not favour an abundance
of healthy children as tecnophobic, the
opposite terms being tecnophilic and tecno-
philia. These words imply correctly that the problem is essentially psychological.
At present the average age on marriage is
33 and for more than half professional men it is an affair of practically middle life-33
and over, yet according to various authorities
(see Ellis, I933) it ought to be 25 for a man
and 24 for a woman. Nature intends man and woman to marry about that age. Early marriage means a smaller maternal and infantile mortality. If late marriage becomes an institution, it entails many social evils, as Carr-Saunders (I922) has pointed out: prostitution, irregular sexual unions, and an
increase of venereal disease. It is a dis-
astrous policy to tell the average professional man that he must lead a monastic life from i8 to 33. It is a fundamental tenet of mental
health that, as already stated, a man should live an emotional life appropriate to his years,* and there is no doubt that by 25 he ought to be the head of a family. Early marriage would mean that by 55 the man would already have several grandchildren, but at
present the professional man at the age of 6o has only one or two unmarried children in the twenties. It is not usually realized that the difference between these two results is the difference between a social group which has a potentially vigorous future and one which is dying out.
I would recommend as the first step to remedy late marriage that each profession sets up a body of men to discuss how conditions may be altered so as to favour earlier marriage.
2. The Misuse of Contraception. Probably the most commonly accepted view among eugenists in the past regarding contraception has been that married people should be entirely free to choose whether they will have children or not, and therefore contraceptives should be available to every one. It is said that where these articles are prohibited the unfit outbreed the fit and that such evils as venereal disease and artificial abortion increase. In democratic countries, it is held,

a number of men who married in the late thirties and had relatively large families.
5. Education and Size of Family. A group of I77 boys at an expensive public school was
examined. It was found that of these boys and their brothers and sisters only 4 o per
cent came from families of 5 or more children, yet in my series of successful busi-
ness men who had surviving children, 33-5
pNr cent of their children came from families
of 5 or more, that is, eight times as many as the public school group. The corresponding figure for the professional class was i6-3 per
cent or four times as many. Again, the per-
centages of the relatively sterile 2-child and
i-child families at the expensive school are 36-4 per cent and 6 5 per cent, which is considerably in excess of I5 *I per cent and 3 o per cent for the business class, while the figures for the professional class are 25 * 2 per
cent and 7 * 8 per cent. Nevertheless, in Medicine and at the Bar,
the families of public school men, although still below replacement, were significantly
larger than those of men educated elsewhere. This also held for the learned professions as
a whole-the Bar, Medicine, Church and Home Civil Service. (Teachers were not examined in this way because nearly all were at public sch6ols or Oxford or Cambridge.) Head masters had more children than mem-
bers of any other profession. Public school boys prefer some professions to others, thus 34 per cent of successful barristers were at public schools, but only 23 per cent of Fellows of the British Academy and 20 per
cent of Fellows of the Royal Society.
6. The Wife's Status and Occu.pation. A
special study was made of professional men to see if marriage into a family the father of which appeared to be wealthy led to an increased size of family, but the iesults were inconclusive. Fourteen medical men, however, who married university graduates had an average surviving family of 2 43 children.
Aristocrats who marry commoners have significantly smaller families than those who marry aristocrats.
7. Success. Those who reached the very highest naval ranks had significantly larger

families than the lower ranks mentioned in Who's Who. In the Army and Church the larger families of Generals and Bishops, compared to the less successful men, showed a barely significant difference. Two hundred and eight Fellows of the Royal Society, representing Science, had an average of I.75
children, and IO9 Fellows of the British Academy, representing Scholarship, had I - 69 children.
8. Three hundred and six Conservative M.P.s had an average of i 98 children, while I33 Labourmembers had I 44 children apiece.
9. In the small material examined, no evidence was obtained of differences in fertility of different religious groups, e.g.
Roman Catholics and Jews. io. The seriousness of the fall in the birth
rate is emphasized. This is brought about by two institutions-late marriage and the misuse of contraception. It is suggested that
committees be set up in each profession to alter conditions so as to favour marriage at 25 instead of 33.
ii. Earlier marriage has elsewhere been found to lead to less misuse of contraception because younger people face the future with more confidence. The authorities in each profession, particularly in the Forces, must ensure as far as possible that fertility is not
a bar to advancement.
