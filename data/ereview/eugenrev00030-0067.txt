the Population of Great Britain

Some Facts

THE NUMBERS OF people living in Great Britain have grown steadily, as is shown by the following census figures and estimates:
millions 1901 .. .. .. .. .. 37-0 1911 40-8 1921 .. .. .. .. .. 42-8 1931 44-8 1941 469 1951 48&9 1961 50-9

The increment has for long been fairly con-

stant at some 2 million persons per decade.

The respective contributions of births, deaths

and net migratory movements towards the

changes in the total numbers have been approxi-

mately as follows (in millions):

Net Net

1951-1961 7-9 5-8 0.1

These figures show that the constancy of the amount of growth is partly fortuitous, because variations in the excess of births over deaths have been counterbalanced by variations in migration. The net effect of migration over the last forty years has, however, been small: it has added only 0-2 million persons out of a total growth of 8d1 million persons.
As far as can be seen at the moment, the prospects for the next thirty years are for a continuation of about the same quantity of increase in the total size of the population. According to the most recent forecast by the
Registrar General for England and Wales, the
population of that country is likely to grow by nearly two million during 1958-68 and by a
similar number of persons during 1968-78. A
slightly smaller rise is expected between 1978 and 1988. The results for Great Britain would be
expected to be very similar, as the inclusion of Scotland could change these figures only to a marginal extent.
