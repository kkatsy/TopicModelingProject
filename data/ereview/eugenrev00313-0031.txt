A BRILLIANT FAMILY

And an Interesting Link with Oliver Cromwell By W. T. J. GUN, F.R.Hist.S., F.S.G.

T HE late Sir James Headlam-Morley, Historiographer to the Foreign Office and author of Twelve Days, the stan-
dard work in this country on the events immediately preceding the War, was one of a remarkable and most versatile family
group, to which attention was called in The
Times obituary last September. It may be worth while to trace back further the family history, which in one line at least presents features of quite unusual interest. The line in question is as follows:

cousin of his wife; he later rose to be
Chief Justice under the Commonwealth. Richard Bentley was the famous scholar
and Master of Trinity; with his daughter
Johanna all the young men of Cambridge were said to have been in love. Denison Cumberland, who ultimately won the prize, was the grandson of another notable
scholar, Richard Cumberland, Bishop of Peterborough. The younger Richard Cum-
berland of the pedigree was very well known in his day as a dramatist.

Of the above ancestors, direct and collateral,
Elizabeth Cromwell was on very intimate terms with her cousin Oliver; for her judgment he had a high regard, evidenced by a striking letter which he wrote to her just before the Civil Wars. Oliver St. John appeared in the famous Ship Money case as
counsel for John Hampden, also a first

Coming down to recent times, four of the sons of Archdeacon John Headlam and
Maria Morley became wranglers, the eldest, Thomas Emerson Headlam, being ultimately Judge Advocate-General. While this
generation was so purely mathematical, the next, curiously enough, was mainly classical in its attainments, at least four of the Arch-

deacon's grandsons taking first-class Honours in classics. These grandsons, besides Sir James Headlam-Morley himself, include his brother, the Bishop of Gloucester, and his first cousins, Mr. Maurice Headlam, Controller of the National Debt Office, Mr. Cuthbert Headlam, late Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty, Major-General Sir John Headlam, Brigadier-General Hugh Headlam, Captain Sir
Edward Headlam, R.N., Mr. Geoffrey Headlam, Master at Eton, Mr. Cecil Head-

lam, author and cricketer, and the late
Walter Headlam, well known alike as a scholar and a poet.
Many different influences were, of course, responsible for this remarkable group, and the interest of the connection with the
Cromwell family is no doubt mainly genealogical. The direct descent, however, from the scholars Richard Bentley and the elder Richard Cumberland cannot be altogether without biological significance.

THE BARCLAY CONNECTION
MY attention has recently been drawn to the fact that it does not appear that a daughter of David Barclay, son of Robert Barclay the Apologist, married Thomas Plumpstead, as stated in my chart published in the EUGENICS REVIEW of July, I925. On further investigation I have ascertained that Thomas Plumpstead's wife was the daughter of one John Freame, and consequently the
Lloyd and Wordsworth families are not, as stated, descended from Robert Barclay.
It is a remarkable and interesting fact,
however, that all the principal families set
out in the chart, the Galtons, Wakefields, Gurneys, Buxtons, Hoares, Lloyds, and Wordsworths, remain related, and the general eugenic value of the chart remains therefore unaltered. This arises from the fact that Mrs. Thomas Plumpstead's sister

Priscilla married the above David Barclay. The accompanying abbreviated chart will make the position clear.
The chart as revised should be called
the Freame connection. The founder, John Freame, though not so
well known a figure as Robert Barclay of
Ury, was nevertheless a man of mark in his day: originally a goldsmith, he developed into a banker, and was the real founder of Barclays Bank, afterwards carried on by the descendants of his daughter Priscilla.
I may take this occasion of adding to the chart three further names of interest, des-
cendants both of Robert Barclay and of John Freame: Sir Maurice de Bunsen, late
Ambassador at Vienna, through the Gurneys; Lord Tyrell, now Ambassador at Paris, through the Wakefields; and the
Rev. H. B. Chapman of the Savoy Chapel,
also through the Wakefields.
