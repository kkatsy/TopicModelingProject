FERTILITY AND ECONOMIC STATUS IN LONDON*

By D. V. GLASS

IN the course of an investigation into changes in fertility in England and Wales since I85I, gross and net reproduction
rates were computed by applying the specific fertility rates of other countries to the female populations in the different parts of England and Wales. Tests of this method show that in practice the error involved is not more than 6 per cent., so that the substitute rates are sufficiently accurate for most of the needs of
demographic analysis.t
On the basis of these gross and net reproduction rates, it was decided to attempt an analysis of differential fertility. But the census material available does not permit the construction of gross reproduction rates for
the economic or social classes of the country,
because no analysis of status is given for women who are unmarried but not gainfully employed. Since, therefore, the classes could not be separated either for the whole country
or for its component parts, it was decided to follow the method of Heron and compare gross and net reproduction rates in the various administrative divisions of London with factors which would act as indices of the social or economic class of these divisions. In his study Heron compared fertility (defined as the number of legitimate births per
I00 wives aged 2o and upwards in i85I, and
as the number of legitimate births per I00 wives aged I5 to 54 in I90I) with nine separate factors which he regarded as being indicative of poverty or prosperity.
* This is a modified version of a paper which was first read at a meeting of the Study Group of the Royal Statistical Society in January I938. My thanks are due to Dr. E. C. Rhodes and to the various members of the Study Group for valuable suggestions.
t A detailed study of the limitations of various kinds of substitute replacement rates has been completed,
and it is hoped that the results will be published in the autumn.

In recent months Mitra* and Martint have continued Heron's work and brought it up to date. Mitra follows Heron rather closely in order to obtain a comparable series of correlation coefficients. Martin, however, goes considerably further. In addition to a series of individual indices he uses a social class index of the Metropolitan Boroughs, obtained by placing the Registrar-General's five classes for the whole of London on a normal scale, finding the mean of each social class on this scale, multiplying the numbers in the social dasses in each borough by these mean values, summing them and- then dividing by the total males in the five classes. But apart from the justification of putting this type of social phenomenon on a normal scale, Martin's method does not allow the comparison of fertility and social status over any significant length of time. Up to the present the Registrar-General's social classes
are available only for the ig2i census, and
the assumption, implicitly made by Martin for the purpose of one of his analyses, that the social classes of the various Metropolitan Boroughs remained unchanged be-
tween I9II and I93I, is probably unjustified.
To obtain a series of approximately comparable class indices for a number of the censuses since I85I, it is evident that one must fall back on occupational and other factors which can be obtained at each census. In order to avoid begging the question as to what constitutes social class, it was decided to choose factors indicative of high or low economic status, so that the resultant index should be as nearly as possible a purely economic one. As it was desired to have indices which were all suggestive of the

height of economic status rather than of the reverse, factors which showed the proportion of low status employment were turned upside down. The factors chosen were:
i. The number of males engaged in professional occupations per IOO occupied males.
2. The number of occupied males per IOO males employed in occupations indicative of low status areas.*
3. The number of female domestic servants per IOO total population excluding domestic servants.t
4. The percentage of the total population living less than two in a room.+
Variations in the type of census information available prevents complete comparabilityin particular the age groupings of the occupied population differs between censuses§but it is possible to obtain fair comparability with the four indices described above for the censuses of I9OI to I93I; while if the undercrowding index is omitted it is possible to include the I85I census in the comparison. The factors were combined on the lines of an unweighted price index. For each factor the proportions in the individual boroughs (or Registration Districts in I85I) were turned into indices by using the corresponding proportion for London as a whole as the base, the indices being then added and a simple average taken. The resultant figure suffers from a number of defects, but appears to be fairly reasonable as an indication of the relative social status of the variousboroughs at each census. No attempt was made to compare changes in economic class over a period of time, so the problem of discounting apparent class changes by the structural

change occurring in the country as a whole over the same periods did not arise.
Tables I and II show the gross reproduction rates computed at the various censuses, an average of the births for the three years centring on each census being used. The Registrar-General's Annual Review for I900 to I902 did not give the customary separation of births into males and females, so that for I90I it was only possible to compute total specific fertility rates. These differ from gross reproduction rates merely by the proportion of female to total live births, so that their substitution is unlikely to influence seriously the value of any correlation to be found between fertility and status. (At the previous census the sex ratio varied by only 4 per cent.

between the districts of London.) But it should, of course, be borne in mind as a
possible qualification of the results for I90I. More serious, however, is the fact that whereas the required economic information for I90I was given for the Metropolitan Boroughs, the vital statistics for I900 to I902 were given for Registration Districts and Sub-Districts. From these districts it was
possible accurately to construct 22 Metropolitan Boroughs, instead of the 28 (excluding the City) for which vital statistics were
subsequently available. For this reason the figures for I90I are not included as an essential part of the present paper, though they
are referred to later. Table III shows the
values of the combinations of factors used

in Table IV below show that the status index
-whether measured on the basis of three or four factors-gives a wide range of dispersion
and therefore differentiates markedly be-
tween the position of the various boroughs
and districts of London. Taking all the Registration Districts of
London in I85I (excluding the City areathat is, City, East London and West London)
and all the Metropolitan Boroughs for i9ii to I93I (excluding the City), the correlation coefficients were obtained which are set out in Table V.
It will be noticed that these coefficients are all extremely high, and that they exhibit no consistent trend. Further, the inclusion of the index of overcrowding does not signifi-

sets of coefficients for I9II does not agree
with Dr. Heron's conclusion that the intensity of the fertility - status relationship doubled between the middle of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth
century. Gross reproduction rates are indices of fer-
tility only, and in discussing the question of differential fertility it is clear that we are
equally, if not more, interested in the net replacement resulting from the combined forces of fertility and mortality. For this reason female Life Tables were constructed

those for the selected boroughs and districts also show signs of a dissipation between I9II and I93I. But the absolute changes are so slight as to be without real significance.
However, the question of trends in differential fertility is not settled by this answer, for clearly it is possible to maintain the same intensity in a relationship between factors
while the range covered by one of the factors falls considerably. The correlation would be perfect if fertility fell by 50 per cent. m moving from a status of ioo to one of I50, or if it only fell by 5 per cent. with the same change in status, provided only that the change in fertility were finite and consistent in relation to the change in status. Some indication that this trend is true of differen-
tial fertility in London is seen by comparing the coefficients of variation of the fertility rates with those of the indices of status for the different years (see Table VIII).

coefficient of variation of only 6 * 65 per cent. in I9II and I.95 per cent. in I93I. In fact,
the coefficients of correlation between net replacement and status in the selected
boroughs were -o*949±0022 in I9II and
-0905±0039 in I93I. The I93I coefficient is slightly lower than the corresponding
one derived by using gross reproduction rates, but that for i9ii is actually higher
than its gross reproduction counterpart. This, together with an examination of the
fertility and status indices for the boroughs, suggests a possible curvilinear distribution of fertility, which may have been straightened out by the introduction of the mortality factor in I9II. This was tested by correlating
the logarithms of both fertility and status indices, which produced the following coefficients: (a) gross reproduction rates and
status, -o 967± o-OI4in I9II, and -Oo 924 +O-032 in I93I, and (b) net reproduction rates and status, -o0963±o-oI6 in I9II, and -o*9I6+O*035 in I93I.
It has been shown that, so far as the intensity of the relationship between fertility and status is concerned, there have been no fundamental changes since I85I. All the correlations show some tendency for an in-
tensification between i85i and I9II, and

From Table VIII it is clear that between
i85i and I9II the coefficient of variation of
fertility increased much more than that of status, while between I9II and I93I the range
of fertility has fallen in relation to the range of status. This would suggest that a unit change in status would be accompanied by a greater change in fertility in I9II than in
either i85I or I93I, implying a reversal of

trends after i9ii. The question of the deficiency of birth registration in I85I prevents an unquestioned acceptance of the apparent trend between I85I and I9II, though this is given some support by an analysis of the fertility of the counties of England and Wales over the same period.* But between I9II and I93I, for which dates the results may be taken as reasonably reliable, the change of trend is probably significant. This conclusion is supported by the trend of fertility in the individual boroughs between I9II and I93I. Correlations between the level of fertility in I9II and the percentage fall in fertility between I9II and I93I yield coefficients of +o * 8oi + o * o68 for all boroughs (excluding the City only), and
+o * 858 ± o *o58 for the selected boroughs,
thus showing a marked tendency for all districts to fall to the same low level of fertility in spite of the fact that differences in the range of economic status between I9II and I93I were very small.
The results may be shown in a slightly
* The coefficients of variation of the gross reproduction rates of all the counties of England and Wales are: I851, 7-7 per cent.; I87I, 8*5 per cent.; i89i, 12.4 per cent.; I9II, i6.7 per cent.; and I93I, II*3 per cent.

different way by using the regressions of the correlations. By expressing these for fertility in terms of status, and calculating for each
regression the rise in fertility accompanying a fall in status from I50 to I00, the data set out
in Table IX were obtained.

The main features in Table IX are shown in the following graphs.
With net reproduction rates the percentage rise for selected boroughs, using the fourfactor index of status, is 47-0 in I9II compared with 33-I in I93I, on the basis of the simple correlations, and 23-I in I9II compared with I7.3 in I93I on the basis of the log/log correlations. But whatever the basis used in the correlations, and whether the regression is linear or not, the trend is con-
sistent-a possible increase in differential

fertility between I85I and I9II, and a
probable decrease between I9II and I93I. It is not claimed that this conclusion is definitive. The methods of analysis are crude and the basic data for I930-2 refer to a period of abnormally high unemployment, which

may temporarily have influenced the results. But the conclusion is certainly in keeping with what we might expect, and it is hoped that this preliminary survey will be followed by more detailed studies of other and less
defective material.
