Younger Marriages in England and Wales and the Consequences for Fertility

SOME FACTS

SOMB REFERENCE TO proportions married in
this country and their variations was made
on page 60 of the April, 1961 issue of the REVEw. It is regretted that one of the figures
shown there was incorrect. The proportion
married for men aged 15-19 should have been, not 0-041, but 0 004.
The number of marriages in England and Wales in recent years have been as follows (thousands):

Apart from a deficit in 1931 (economic
depression) and an excess in 1938 (economic recovery and anticipation of war) the numbers do not exhibit a very notable trend. The ages at first marriage have, however, moved steadily in one direction, as the following averages show:

A fall of more than two years in the average
within 25 years represents a change of considerable demographic and social implications. In view of the potential effect on fertility of the trend towards younger marriages, it is worth
while to examine it in more detail; the following tables show the proportions of all marriages that have occurred in specific age-groups:

In theory a shift of a certain proportion of first marriages from one age to another in Britain need not make any difference to the size of the family the couple may have, in view of the fact that family planning is very widely and successfully employed in this country. In practice, the relativities between the numbers of children born to couples marrying at different ages have remained comparatively constant in spite of changes in the level of fertility and shifts in the marriage-pattern, as the following index figures of relative family size show; that for age 25-29 at marriage is standardized at 100:
AGE OF WOMAN AT MARRIAGE
Marriages of 15-19 20-24 25-29 30-34 35-39 40-44 1900-09 192 142 100 76 47 25 1929 207 143 100 70 40 14 1939 177 127 100 72 35 10 1949 (est.) 172 123 100 74 37 12
It is too early to give a firm estimate for marriages contracted later than 1949, as familybuilding is too incomplete for the younger married couples.
As an example ofthe effect ofearlier marriages

upon family size, the average ofthe fertility index figures for 1939 shown above, if weighted with the 1938 distribution of marriages, is 114.
Correspondingly, the average of the 1949 figures, if weighted with the 1951-55 distribution of marriages, is 120, an increase of 5 per cent. It is not outside the bounds of possibility that
the total extent to which marriages are now

occurring at younger ages, as compared with before the War of 1939-45, may have been reflected in up to a ten per cent increase in average family size, or nearly one-quarter of a child per couple. To this, or more probably a lesser extent, younger marriages in recent years have contributed to the recent rise in the birth
rate in England and Wales.
