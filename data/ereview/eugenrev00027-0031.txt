1. TRANSITIONS IN PUBLIC OPINION AND IN LEGAL ASSESSMENTS
TtHE MAIN FEATURE which emerges from this brief review of a few selected countries is that the practice of steriliza-
tion throughout the world is undergoing a rapid transition.
At one end of the spectrum is the now mainly historical view that sterilization is primarily a method for controlling the multiplication of the "unfit"; at the other end is the idea, born after 1945, that its voluntary practice can contribute to a solution ofthe world's population problems. Operative in the middle ranges of the spectrum is the belief that voluntary sterilization can contribute much to the health and well-being of both individuals and families.
In the view that voluntary sterilization has demographically beneficial possibilities, Asian countries now lead. Indeed, for these there has been little transition, since sterilization was never seriously regarded as a measure of social prophylaxis against the excessive reproduction of the "unfit." The full range of the spectrum is best seen in the United States.
In communities where sterilization is, or has been, compulsorily applied to people who were

deemed to be unfit or legally incompetent, and still more when it was punitively applied, it can
be felt as a hall-mark of disgrace. And surgeons performing such operations rightly feel that they need legal protection. The distinction in law
between compulsory and voluntary sterilization tends to be obscured; and in at least one country doctors were at one time advised by a big Medical Protection Society not to undertake voluntary sterilization-advice which has since been modified. The past practices of the Nazis have added to the fears and the general distaste.
Now, however, tens of thousands of people are being sterilized throughout the world who are
in no sense whatever unfit; and the alleged legal dangers are either ignored, as in India, or circumvented as in the United States. Indeed, bold initiatives have been taken in Asian countries.
Their disrespect for legal niceties -resembles -the
way a newly formed Division treated suspected mine-fields in Normandy during the battles of
1944: this Division ignored the mine-fields which had held up a more experienced and cautious unit: it treated them as if they did not exist and swept through suffering no casualties.
Now the new possibilities which are being explored in Asia are being increasingly discussed

people sterilized on mainly psychiatric grounds later reported favourably on the effects of the
operation.
There is a general similarity of results of reported follow-up inquiries of voluntarily sterilized people. A substantial majority of from
75 per cent upwards report themselves as entirely satisfied; a minority of from 10 to 15 per cent

144-

VOLUNTARY STERILIZATION: TRANSITIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD

report dissatisfaction not amounting to permanent regret; and a smaller minority, usually under 10 per cent, express definite regret. The larger the proportion of psychiatric cases in the sample, especially of neurotics and sufferers from hypochondriacal anxiety, the larger are these last two minorities.
Other factors contributing to dissatisfaction in Dr. Ekblad's and other samples are the following: Youthfulness (unfavourable aftereffects are rare among women sterilized after thirty-five); few children (complaints rare among women with more than four children); unhappiness in marriage; pressure to give consent brought to bear by a relative; and intense maternal feelings.
Of Dr. Ekblad's 225 women, 116 (52 per cent) were assessed by him as having neurotic or abnormal personality traits. Their attitudes to sterilization were: satisfied 82 per cent; dissatisfied but not to the point of definite regret 14 per cent; permanent regret 4 per cent. Comparable inquiries have mostly been done in Switzerland and the United States, most of which are reported by Dr. Ekblad.
Among the Swiss investigations may be mentioned those of:
H. Binder (1937, Basle): 293 women of whom 90 per cent were on the whole satisfied, some with reservations;
E. Bauman and 0. Geiser (1939): 187 women of whom 81 per cent were satisfied, 10 per cent had reservations and 9 per cent regretted;
R. Wenner (1939, Basle): 904 women of whom 95 per cent were satisfied and 5 per cent dissatisfied;
A. Labhart (1939): 652 women of whom 96-6 per cent were satisfied and 4-4 per cent dissatisfied, all the latter having been sterilized on psychiatric grounds;
A. Naville (1952, Zurich): 230 mentally healthy women sterilized at their own request. Reactions wholly favourable 82 per cent, mainly favourable 13 per cent, mainly unfavourable 3 per cent, wholly unfavourable 2 per cent;
P. A. Hoppeler (1954, Zurich): 100 women sterilized on psychiatric grounds: 89 per cent favourable, 5 per cent reservations, 6 per cent regretted, though according to Hoppeler "the advantages were objectively greater than the disadvantages."
* Sterilization in Japan. Eugenics Quarterly, September, 1961, 8, 3.

Among American investigations may be mentioned those of:
J. H. Craft (1936, South Dakota): 127 mentally defective women of whom 77 per cent were satisfied, 17 per cent indifferent and 8 per cent dissatisfied.
A. C. Barnes and F. P. Zuspan (1958): 311 women sterilized in puerperium of whom 90 per cent were wholly or partly satisfied and 10 per cent regretted.
A. Guttmacher (1957, New York): Fertility and Sterility, 8, 6. (Not quoted by Ekblad): 150 puerperal sterilizations: 95 3 per cent satisfied; 4-7 per cent regrets. Dr. Guttmacher comments: "On the basis of this study one may hazard the guess that nineteen patients in twenty will be happy and grateful for the permanent prevention of conception, which they wished and still wish. However, one patient in twenty will change her mind, frequently because of circumstances beyond her control. Can we pick out this twentieth patient? I think not."
The salient feature ofthese Swiss and American inquiries, like those reported below from Japan and India, is the uniformly large majority who were on the whole satisfied with the operation. Dr. Ekblad's valuable monograph gives full references.
The five countries here considered are selected from a quite wide range of countries and islands wherein sterilization is practised. The five illustrate different contemporary approaches. The experiences of Japan and India-particularly their follow-up inquiries-are considered at some length because of their novel features and because of the large numbers dealt with during a short period (after 1945). The positions in bothexpecially that in India-are highly transitional. The interim nature of the figures now available (June 1962) is especially pronounced.
4. JAPAN
The most recent figures known to me have been published by Dr. Yoshio Koya.* This authority quotes national figures which suggest (though Dr. Koya does not say so) that, in the last decade, sterilization has been more widely practised in Japan than in any other country in the world.
But the national figures give imperfect information on important issues. Hence Dr.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

Koya supplements them by the findings of a fairly detailed investigation, conducted by his staff, of 812 persons sterilized since Japan's Eugenic Protection Law was passed in 1948. In what follows the national figures are first given. They have been prepared by the Government of Japan from the reports of "designated doctors"; I will then consider some of the findings of the special inquiry. The tables here shown are a selection, some slightly adapted, from those which appear in Dr. Koya's article.
Under Japan's Eugenic Protection Law (1948) both sterilization and abortion are sanctionable in the following circumstances:
When the mother or father has a hereditary disease, psychosis or leprosy. (The presence in more distant relatives of a hereditary disease or of psychosis likewise provides grounds.)
When pregnancy threatens the life of the mother.
When the mother already has several children and when every pregnancy and delivery can lower her health.
It will be noticed that two of these three provisions involve the mother only; also that they are concerned with health and not with socio-

economic issues. However, Dr. Koya points out that there is much latitude in the last provision; bad living conditions and anxieties over numerous children and over further unwanted pregnancies can depress health and can thus be interpreted as justifying sterilization.
National Figures
Table 1 is based on figures prepared by the Japanese Government from reports of the above-mentioned "designated" doctors who are expected to send in returns. It will be seen that, in the period 1949-59, over 340,000 people were thus sterilized. But Dr. Koya adds that three or four times more un-notified sterilizations were probably performed outside the provisions of the Act. "Whatever the true figure," he says, "sterilizations are exerting considerable influence on the reproductivity of the Japanese population".
The following points will be noted:
1 The three reasons listed in columns 2-4 follow the categories laid down in the above-quoted Eugenic Protection Law. All are concerned with health. But the difficulties of distinguishing between the so-called medical reason (Col. 3: threat to mother's life) and the so-called health reason (Col 4: lowering mother's health) were such that, in 1952 and 1953, the two categories were combined under column 3.
2 Eugenic reasons and leprosy (Col. 2) constituted a small minority (4-1 per cent) of the total cases.
3 So-called health reasons (Col. 4) amounted to just under half the total. If the relevant cases classified in 1952-53 under Column 3 were included, as in the other years, under Column 4, the total would exceed half. Under this heading are certainly comprised many people whose real motive was socio-economic. (Dr. Koya found in his special inquiry that, of 477 persons, only 110 (26 per cent) were sterilized for strictly medical reasons.)
4 There were sharp rises each year throughout the period 1949-55. The rises (Col. 5) were sharpest between 1949 and 1950, and between 1952 and 1953. Since 1956 there has been a slight decline but in the five years 1955-59 the yearly total has exceeded 40,000.
5 The percentage of males sterilized is small, ranging from 1 -I per cent in 1950 to 4-2 per cent in 1957.

146

VOLUNTARY STERILIZATION: TRANSITIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD

are unrealistic because the data had to be adjusted to the three categories defined by the Act of 1948. In particular, the reasons given for
seeking sterilization were unrealistic. In January 1958, therefore, Dr. Koya and his staff embarked on the special inquiry above mentioned. Of the 812 respondents in the sample who had been sterilized after 1948, 632 (78 per cent) were wives and 180 (22 per cent) husbands. The proportion ofmen was thus much higher than in the national total (Table 1). The interviews were conducted by doctors and midwives; the 812 respondents were drawn from two prefectures (314 people) and from four industrial enterprises involving two mining companies, a steel and a shipbuilding company. Dr. Koya tells me that this sample may not be representative, particularly from the socio-economic standpoint, of the total

lized. The table gives the age and parity of these 180 women when their husbands were sterilized.
The following points may be noted:
1 The age-group most favoured by women for sterilization (or the age-period most favoured for their wives when men get sterilized) is 30-34; 43 per cent of the sample fell within this age group; 75 per cent of the women were over thirty. The 25 per cent under thirty may have comprised medical cases in a strictly defined sense. A sub-sample of 477 (of the 812 respondents in the sample) comprised 23 per cent of such strictly medical cases.
2 The parity most favoured when sterilization is performed is three: 325 people (40 per cent). This is nearly twice the number of people sterilized with two (21'3 per cent) or four (20 5 per cent) live children. The suggestion is that most women in the sample are sterilized before they are in extremis through excessive fertility.

The main objective of the inquiry was such that the sample could not be very large: this because it was held to be important that as many as possible of the interviews be conducted by doctors (limited in number and all busy men) on the staff of his Institute. Their main object (and that of the inquiry) was to throw light on the physical and psychological effects of sterilization. The tables which follow are based upon this sample of 812 respondents.

Neither of these findings suggest that sterilization is being abused in Japan, either by being sought by very young people or by people who have not had a reasonable quota of children.

The four main headings of Table 3 relate to differing totals. We are told that the investigators "proceeded as carefully as possible, omitting a fairly large number of cases who gave ambiguous or vague answers." The men numbered about a hundred so that percentages are omitted.

sterilization there were initial differences, eightyfive, who presumably wanted to be sterilized, took the initiative, the husband later consenting; and ofthe corresponding thirty men, twenty-four took the initiative. It is interesting that, in the remaining six cases of contemplated vasectomy (line 4), the wife took the initiative. Some people may wonder whether this could have happened twenty-five years ago in Japan; and they may see in this small figure an indication that Japanese men are open to argument as to the advantages of vasectomy.
Abortions before Sterilization
Information was available of the relevant histories of 720 wives (Table 5).

Is this not a good thing? It is not clear from this report to what extent the Japanese authorities regard sterilization (as they do contraception) as a desirable alternative to abortion which, in Japan, has been the main social instrument for keeping a rocketing population within bounds. Total annual numbers of reported sterilizations in Japan have declined
slightly since 1956 (Table 1); and the Japanese have not pressed the possibilities of vasectomy
as the Indians have recently done. Conception control is the favoured alternative
to abortion; and progress is being made in the change-over. Dr. Koya writes: "We have no reason to encourage sterilization as an alternative to conception control in this country."

5. INDIA*
Background
The story of India's reactions to her population problem is remarkable. As soon as their country acquired independence in 1947 responsible Indians began to think of the future. They recognized that the raising of living standards was impeded by the rapidity with which the population was growing, and a population policy was inaugurated in a manner which would have been impossible under British colonial

It will be seen that over 60 per cent of the 720 wives had had one or more abortions before they or their husbands were sterilized; and that seventy-one of these women (nearly 10 per cent) had had three or more abortions.
Dr. Koya remarks that these findings "show us that sterilization is often resorted to as an alternative to conception control or as a remedy for induced abortion. This also suggests that if induced abortion is strongly suppressed or prohibited at a place where facilities for conception control are limited, people may incline to become sterilized."
* The views held by Indians on the value of sterilization in contributing to a solution of their country's population problem have changed in the last few years. A valuable account of the position at the end of 1958 will be found in the December 1958 number of the (Quarterly) Journal of Family Welfare, (5, 2) of which the editor is Mrs. Avabai Wadia, 1 Metropolitan House, Dadabhai Naoroji Road, Bombay, 1.
t It has recently been shown that these methods are far from being the most prevalently used in Britain.

rule. After an unencouraging experiment with the
rhythm method and after the establishment of a vigorous Family Planning Association, it came to be felt that the provision of guidance on birth control should primarily be a responsibility of the health services. Appliance methods, used by the female, such as were mainly advised in the
birth control clinics of western countries,t were
regarded as the method of choice. But follow-up inquiries showed that these
methods were difficult for Indian women; and doubts came to be felt as to whether they would be effective in curbing the rate of population growth. These doubts were confirmed by the results of the 1961 census. The census showed that the population problem was getting worse instead of better. There had been an "unprecedented increase" of about 18 per cent in the preceding decade-from a total figure of 359 to about 438 million. The last figure exceeded the upper limit of all forecasts and was some 7

149

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

million more than the figure (431 million) on
which the third five-year plan had been based. These two events-the realization that current
methods of birth control were largely impracticable by Indian couples and the shock of the 1961 census figures-provided the impetus to inaugurate a sterilization policy.
At first this policy found little favour with the Indian Family Planning Association, and the
Government naturally hesitated. But in 1959 the Health Department committed itself. The most noteworthy features of the ensuing story have been the swing towards sterilizing males rather than females, and the wide differences in the use of sterlization made by the fifteen Indian States (which are largely free to develop their own health policies). The movement has been led by the states of Madras and Maharashtra; and among the most influential people in bringing about the change have been Mr. R. A. Gopalaswami (Madras) and Dr. G. M. Phadke (Bombay). The present position is in the highest degree transitional.

National Figures
The Health Department of the Government of India publishes an illustrated monthly journal Family Planning News, now in its third year. Here have appeared figures of sterilizations performed in India as a whole. I am indebted to Colonel B. L. Raina for sending me the

figures available as late as July 1962. They are shown in Table 6.
It will be seen that, over the period 1956-61, the annual figures rose sharply. The increases were most pronounced between 1957 and 1960. Especially noteworthy is the rise in the proportion of males sterilized during the period. The percentage rose from twenty-seven in 1957 to over seventy-two in 1961. Salpingectomies reached a peak of over 21,000 in 1959.
Madras State
Madras State has taken a leading part in popularizing and organizing sterilization, the possibilities of which have been vigorously set forth by Mr. R. A. Gopalaswami. This authority was Registrar General of India when the 1951 census was held; and he is now chairman of the Program Committee of the Family Planning Board of Madras State.t Something will here be said about an important follow-up inquiry of women who had been given advice on contraception in Madras, about how Mr. Gopalaswami thinks that a nation-wide sterilization policy might help to solve India's population problem by curbing the rate of growth, and about the numbers of men and women sterilized in Madras State.
The Madras follow-up showed that, in a substantial pilot inquiry involving nearly 40,000 women, a disappointingly small number (some 4 per cent) acted on contraceptive advice. I quote at some length from paragraph 19 of Mr. Gopalaswami's important Statement (1960):
We had expected that it would be easy to get family planning accepted in principle; and that the real difficulties would arise in getting any very sizeable proportion to practise it. This pilot experiment has confirmed that this is sober truth. This may be illustrated from an analysis of detailed data relating to the city of Madras for the first seven months of 1959. During this period, intensive instruction was provided for women who came to any one of three large maternity hospitals maintained by the State Government or any one of forty-four Mother's Information Centres located in Child Welfare Centres maintained by the Madras City Corporation.
Altogether 38,829 mothers were given instruction during the seven months period. Out of this number, only 2,888 mothers (or eight out of 100) disclaimed interest in family planning. All others (that is ninety-two out of 100) were interested.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

Table 6 shows that in the three years 1958-60 over 100,000 people were sterilized in India. Of these nearly 60 per cent were sterilized in
Maharashtra. A report of the State's activities was presented
in an opening address by its Minister of Health, Shri Homi Taleyarkhan, to a seminar on sterilization convened in Bombay during January 1962 by the Indian Family Planning Association. The following are among the points of the Minister's speech: In the three years 1958-60 "we have done nearly 60,000 operations both on the male and female in the State out of a little more than one lakh [a hundred thousand] in the entire country." Most of the operations on males were performed in what are known as vasectomy camps. "Recently," said the Minister, "we organized the world's record vasectomy camp at Satara where 1,510 operations were performed in four days . . . The number of persons desiring to be operated on is increasing so fast that it is difficult to cope with the rush." The Government of India favours these enterprises; it has "appreciated our work and sanctioned liberal amounts for the promotion of the cause."
Safeguards are observed. The person concerned must have at least three children, one a male heir at least eight years old; time is given for emotional preparation so that the candidate may "realize that it is an irrevocable decision of his life"; lastly no one under thirty, unless he has had "a number of children before that age," can be sterilized.
Maharashtra's sensational performance, reported at the above-mentioned seminar, naturally provoked critical discussion, some of it coming from members of India's Family Planning Association. Are things being pushed too fast? Voices enjoining caution were raised.*
* On the other hand it has been argued that, to attain the "targets" for India, the current requirement that the mother must be at least thirty years old and must have had at least three children should be relaxed. This argument is outlined by Dr. D. P. Dandekar in a paper entitled A Standard for Sterilization in the National Program of Fertility Control in India which appeared in 1961. This paper is a contribution to a comprehensive study of the problems of mass sterilization now being carried out by India's Demographic and Research Training Centre, Chembur, Bombay 71.

Vasectomy: A Follow-up Inquiry
Important in India's programme is the recognition of the possibilities of vasectomy. A prominent figure in this movement is Dr. G. M. Phadke, Bombay. Indeed, it was an early paper of Dr. Phadke's which, by attracting the attention of Mr. Gopalaswami, started what might
now be called a chain reaction. Dr. Phadke has published a follow-up study
of 655 of his vasectomized patients. This study, though of narrower scope, has certain features in common with that of Dr. Koya's Japanese follow-up mentioned above. In particular, Dr. Phadke has shown that, after vasectomy, fertility can sometimes be restored by reanastomosis of the vas. This is a valuable pioneer study. If his relatively good results can be reproduced by other surgeons, a much used argument against vasectomy-that it is irrever-
sible-will lose force. Dr. Phadke has published some of the findings
of his follow-up.t His tables fall into two groups, those which describe the results of the operation, and those which deal with some non-medical features of his sample of men-the number of their children, their monthly incomes, and their ages. These last-mentioned tables show that his 655 subjects have had a full quota of children (89 per cent had had three or more and 22 per cent six or more); that according to Indian standards they seem fairly well-to-do (80 per cent had incomes of over 100 rupees a month and 13 per cent over 500 a month); and that they were by no means in the first flush of youth (95
per cent were over thirty, and 37 per cent over
forty). But these features depend upon the selection of cases according to objective criteria.
The probable after-effects of vasectomy on the
general health of the husband, on the general health of the wife and on the sex act also depend
on one's selection of cases. But here the necessary
assessments are less objective. Good results
would be likely to be shown when the husband and wife are physically healthy, psychologically
stable and sexually well adjusted. If the health of either partner is bad, if either is neurotic
(especially in the matter of anxieties about health), or if the marriage is inharmonious, then later troubles are apt to be attributed to the

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

6. THE UNITED STATES AND PUERTO RICO*
The spectrum mentioned at the beginning of this article is most complete in the United States where two simultaneous movements, one waning the other waxing, are offsetting each other. The first is a swing away from the compulsory sterilization of mentally infirm people in State institutions; the second is a swing towards the voluntary sterilization of mentally normal people on therapeutic and social grounds.
There is no over-riding Federal law. Instead is a mosaic of State laws. Of the U.S.A.'s fifty States, twenty-eight have now-operative statutes which apply to mentally infirm people maintained in, or under the supervision of, State institutions. The remaining twenty-two States have no such laws.
Twenty-six of the twenty-eight State laws make provision for compulsory sterilization. But despite the rapid increase of the population of the United States, fewer people are thus sterilized each year.
Counter-balancing this decline is a growing resort to voluntary sterilization on therapeutic and socio-economic grounds. Indeed, an energetic voluntary organization, the Human Betterment Association of America (H.B.A.A.), which
* A valuable bibliography entitled Surgical Steriliza-
tion of Men and Women, containing 403 references, has recently (1962) been produced by Christopher Tietze, M.D., on behalf of the National Committee on Maternal Health Inc.

has no equivalent in Britain, exists to encourage this movement. Its main object is to define and explain the circumstances in which voluntary sterilization may be profitably sought by the public and safely practised by doctors. More. What has been called the world's population explosion has opened a new perspective. It is now being contended in the U.S.A. that voluntary sterilization might help to solve a world population crisis.
In what follows, mention will be made of the U.S.A.'s complicated legal mosaic, of the diminishing practice of compulsory sterilization, and of the movement for promoting voluntary initiatives.
Legal Position The legal issues differ according to whether sterilization is compulsorily applied or voluntarily sought; they further differ in their bearings on the three main uses of voluntary sterilization -eugenic, therapeutic and socio-economic. These issues have been concisely summarized in two documents produced by the Human Betterment Association above-mentioned.t
The State laws are mostly compulsory and eugenic in purpose. Several have been amended and in three States they have been abrogated so that there are now no laws. In the course of these vicissitudes, legal, administrative, humanitarian, and genetic issues have been vigorously debated in a manner which has no parallel in Britain. Some court pronouncements, again without parallel in Britain, have also been widely publicized.

t These are entitled Legal Bibliography on Sterilisation (1957) by Samuel Highleyman and Richard C. Donelly, both of Yale Law School; and a Supplement to the above with the same title published in April 1960 by Bruce Montgomery and R. C. Donelly. The first document, which is the fuller, deals separately with eugenic, therapeutic and socio-economic sterilization to which are added particulars of some important court decisions. Not all of these are confined to the United States: the Bourne Case (1938) is included. Both these summaries are produced by, and obtainable from, the Human Betterment Association of America, Inc., 105 West 55th Street, New York 19, U.S.A. (Secretary: Mrs. Ruth Proskauer Smith.)
Another discussion of the legal issues, which makes use of figures provided by the Human Betterment Association, is a Catholic-sponsored memorandum, Eugenic Sterilization (1956) by James B. O'Hara and T. Howland Sanks (Georgetown Law Journal, 45, 1).

Numbers and Categories of People Sterilized
under State Laws
The first of these State laws was passed during 1907 in Indiana. Of comparable laws since passed in thirty States (including Indiana), two have been declared unconstitutional. The States
concerned were New York where a law passed in 1912 was abrogated in 1918, and Washington where a law passed in 1909 was abrogated in 1942. In a third State, Alabama, a law passed in 1919 is still on the books but has been inoperative since 1935.
It will be seen that mentally deficient people

formed over half the total and that of the total about four in ten were males.
The now-operative laws of twenty-seven States authorize both voluntary and compulsory sterilization; but compulsory statutes heavily outnumber voluntary. In two States-Minnesota and Vermont-the provisions are exclusively voluntary; by the end of 1960, 2,597 people had been sterilized in these two States. In three States-Maine, North Carolina and North Dakota-there are both voluntary and compulsory clauses. By the end of 1960, 6,927 people had been either voluntarily or compulsorily sterilized in these three States. I do not know how the numbers were partitioned between these two categories. Assuming that all were sterilized voluntarily, a total of 9,524 out of 62,162 people (15 per cent) would have been so sterilized. Thus a minimum of 85 per cent of the total would have been compulsorily sterilized.
But these institutional sterilizations under State laws are becoming fewer. During the ten years 1946-55 inclusive, 13,158 people were thus sterilized, giving a yearly average of 1,316. The peak year was 1950 when there were 1,526 operations. The numbers fell steadily till 1955 when the figure was 1,067-a third less.t By 1960 it had fallen to 622-less than half the figure for 1950, ten years before. In seven of the twenty-seven States with relevant statutes no sterilizations had been performed during 1960 and in another nine States the numbers were less than ten. Various causes have been sug-

gested for this decline. They include the effects
of a report of the American Neurological Association which, in 1936, maintained that
compulsion was unnecessary since voluntary measures served as well; changed legal thinking-a growing reluctance to enforce laws which deprive people of what is held to be the
fundamental right of procreation; and the example of the Nazis.
The view of the American Neurological Association (1936) that compulsion is unnecessary has doubtless spread widely in the United States during the last twenty-six years as a result of Nazi practices. Indeed, there may now be many people who, on both ethical and practical grounds, would like to see compulsion abolished altogether.
It may, however, be that the consent of most of those dealt with under nominally compulsory laws is in fact obtained so that in practice (though perhaps not in law) they are voluntarily sterilized. This adjustment of procedure, if widespread, might make it seem unnecessary to alter a law which is but nominally compulsory.
It might, however, accord with the spirit of the times, and also encourage a recognition of the benefits of voluntary sterilization, if, by the addition of a simply worded clause, all States with exclusively compulsory laws were to bring their legislation into line with that of Maine, North Carolina and North Dakota where both com-
pulsory and voluntary provisions exist. If compulsion were in practice scarcely ever used, they might even go so far as to imitate Minnesota and
Vermont whose laws are exclusively voluntary. But these possibilities have doubtless been

guide in such cases. We therefore recommend that the

law be so changed as to make it clear that in cases

where the well-being of a child who might be conceived

of sterilizing operations should be left to the discretion

of the individuals concerned, if adults, and the physi-

It seems that, without special stress on its advantages, sterilization has emerged as the method of choice.

It will be noticed that the three reasons are
described as eugenic, social and medical. Ofthese three the second, comprising social reasons, is seemingly the broadest, admitting of the most elastic interpretation. Slightly re-worded, it might almost be stretched to include the first and third reasons; for both hereditary infirmities and physical diseases impair a woman's capacity for properly fostering her children.

Sweden's population having been about 7j million at the 1961 census, the sterilization rate (based on published figures) is a little under twenty-seven per 100,000 of population. The
picture is one of a voluntary system bureaucratically controlled.

The population of Denmark in 1959 was about 4,547,000. Hence the minimum sterilization rate in 1958 was about 54 per 100,000 of population -about twice that of Sweden's in 1959. The Danish picture is of a voluntary system controlled largely by doctors outside Ministries and by social agencies. In Denmark the medical profession, autonomously following the standards laid down by law, tends to replace the Swedish Board of Health as the main authorizing agency. Since the authorization of a Board of Health or a Ministry is presumably given by doctors within that Ministry appointed for the purpose, the effects of the two systems are doubtless much the same from the standpoint of the individual concerned. Each system may be deemed to have advantages. The fact that Mothers' Aid Agencies in Denmark play such a large part in the abortion and sterilization programmes suggests that social and humanitarian considerations, including those of child welfare, are important features of these programmes.

It will be seen that nearly 70 per cent of sterilizations obtained through Mothers' Aid Agencies were done at the same time as an abortion and that over 80 per cent were done in connection with a pregnancy; also that fifty men were vasectomized through the initiative of these agencies which are primarily concerned with women.
t As above mentioned, Dr. Hoffmeyer is head of the Psychiatric Department in Copenhagen's Mothers' Aid Agency.

9. REVISED POLICY FOR BRITAIN
What can we in Britain learn from the trends and transitions now taking place throughout the world?
Two questions arise: is there, in this country, a need for sterilization and therefore for clarifying the legal obscurities so that doctors know exactly where they stand? And if yes, what is the best course to-day?
In considering the first question, let us not

department takes the initiative, legal innovations of this sort have little chance. Our own Ministry of Health has refrained from acting on the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Population in the matter of providing facilities for birth control on non-medical grounds. Are the prospects better for a sterilization law, how-
ever modest? If it were deemed that the prospects were too
poor to make the effort worth while, another course would be open-to follow the precedent of the American voluntary Association. The aims and activities of the Human Betterment Association have been described. This Association holds that voluntary sterilization is not illegal. But it recognizes that irreversible sterilization is a delicate matter, especially when performed on people for reasons which could be broadly classed as psychiatric. The follow-up inquiries above described (sections 3-5) show that a very small minority of sterilized people later have regrets. These may be well or ill founded. But they nevertheless occur and can be expected in any large series, however careful the selection of cases. The same applies to abortion. Every psychiatrist will have come across women who clamorously demanded abortion, sometimes threatening suicide, but who later have regrets and remorse. Some of these may be litigiously inclined. But if the surgeon has exercised reasonable caution and has acted in good faith on the recommendation of a colleague also acting in good faith, the chances of litigation are small and of the litigation being successful negligible.
The above-named American Association advises doctors who may have doubts about a particular case. It has formed, in different American States, panels of doctors to whom it refers couples. A recent donation even enables it to give financial help to needy couples. (A comparable but smaller Canadian organization now does the same.) The Association proceeds cautiously in its advice to doctors and this policy has been rewarded by an almost total absence of vexatious litigation.
* This is essentially the policy which the far-seeing Dr. Havelock Ellis (who strongly opposed any form of legislation) propounded in 1934. The legal uncertainties which then daunted the medical profession have, since 1960, been largely removed.

It will be recalled that at the end of 1960 two medical defence unions, one in England and the other in Scotland, sought counsel's opinions. Extracts from these reassuring opinions, which have largely transformed the position, were quoted in the first of these three articles and need not be quoted again. But we would do well to remind ourselves of a cautionary note sounded by the English counsel.
Although confident that the courts would uphold the legality of a sterilizing operation on therapeutic or well-founded eugenic grounds, counsel are of the opinion that the risk of an adverse finding increases as the reasons for the operation are medically less well-founded.
This is simple common sense. But it raises the question whether the establishment in Britain of an organization like the American Human Betterment Association might not be a reasonable precaution and a possible help to doctors. Like its American counterpart, this body could formulate and publish a few cautionary principles; and it could draw up forms of request to be filled in by applicants for sterilization, and perhaps also the form of a supporting medical recommendation. It could likewise offer its services in an advisory capacity to doctors who, in particular cases, might be in doubt.*
The establishment of such an organization would be a worthy task for the Eugenics Society which, in the early thirties, set up a somewhat comparable advisory body in connection with a schedule for pre-marital examinations; or for the Family Planning Association; or, perhaps best, for a joint committee representing voluntary organizations with cognate interests in this wide field. Such was the constitution of the (British) Joint Committee on Voluntary Sterilization (1934-39) whose story was told in the second of these articles. Indeed, this simple step could appropriately be taken in any country in the world where a strictly voluntary sterilization policy found favour.
It is a pleasure to thank many persons who have given valued and miscellaneous help.
