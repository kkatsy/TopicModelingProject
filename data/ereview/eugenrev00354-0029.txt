COMMENTS AND CRITICISMS.

The Next Generation.-Apropois of Dr. MooTre's figures (vide

" Periodical Literature ") for the population of Europe 30 years hence,

" Army Surgeon," writing in the Sunday Chronicle, draws much the same

deduc,tion.s, i.e., that in 1940 there will be I00 millions in Genrmany as

a,gainsit 6o millions in England, and 40 millions or less in; France. But

he adds another disquieting suggesition-that Germany has a peasant

population, of 20 millions, while ours is mainly urban, and therefore

less physically fit. Moreover, as Germany is the only nation which has

delibetrately encouraged vice, so also she is the only one to, make it

toileraibly safe for the vicious.

This means that the spread of the venereal diseases wi.ll be most

disastrous outside Germany, and it must be remem-bered th,at they not

only affect the health of the living, but that gonorrhcea is responsible for

a liarge -and increasing piroportion of sterility to still further lower the

birth-rate.

The,re is also the recent rapid riise in the tuberculosis rate and the

generally low level of public health as revealed by recruilting statistics.

Pirofessor Arthur Keith has brought this graphical.ly home by the

following contrasting sets of figures.

Normally, any i,ooo young men collected at random from a popula-

tion of good health and physique should approximately be divided as

follow's:-

"Grade I

... ... ... ... 700

2 ... ... ... ... 200

3 ...

...

...

..

75

,,3 4 * . .. .. 25

i.e., I0 per cent. of unfit men should be expected. (Germany had i6 per

cent. before the War.)

But a typical recruiting survey from an industrial town yield's the

following disastilous results:-

Grade I

...

...

...

Igo

,, 2 ..... ... ... ..2. 70

3 * -... ...

410

130,, 4 ........ ... ... ...

It is certainly time for a Ministry of Health and' a health rate.
