C. 2.-Went to help in greengrocer's shop of B. i. Had illegitimate child by C. i. She herself is an illegitimate child, as also was her mother. Her daughter, D. 9, had an illegitimate child, E. 6. Thus the C. 2 family shows four generations of illegitimacy. She was brought up at the same countrv cottage as her mother, her grandparents-a roadmender and wife-looking after her.

From the birth of the first child they were in constant receipt of relief. In I878 they were in receipt of out-relief for six months, during and after the wife's confinement, the man evidently being out of work. In iS8o C. 6 and C. 7, with D. io and D.

From midsummer, I88i, to Christmas they had out-relief and medical assistance-C. 6 himself being in hospital for dropsy and phthisis. He left the hospital and seven weeks later returned to the workhouse. Meanwhile a third child was born, the family being continuously in receipt of out-relief. In I882 he returned again to hospital. A fourth child, which there is reason to believe died in infancy, was born; the two elder ones became ill. In I883 C. 6 died in hospital. C. 7.-Sister of C. 8, C. 9 and C. ii.

Their names appear fifty-six times in the records over a period of eight years. C. 8.-Born I855, brother of C. II; he was a plasterer, and went to the workhouse for medical relief in 1875.

five children of school age. D. 9.-Illegitimate daughter of C. i and C. 2, married D. i6.
Is a teetotaller. Her first child was illegitimate and born in the workhouse, this making the fourth case of illegitimacy in direct descent, her mother and grandmother and great-grandmother having all had illegitimate children. The joining of the D. 9 and D. i6 strains seems to have strengthened the degenerate tendencies, as the two eldest children are now in the industrial schools and the third is in the infirmary (E. 6, E. 8 and E. 9).
D. IO and D. ii.-D. io was in the workhouse as a child with her parents (see C. 6); applied for medical order in I897, aged i6. Married C. ii and has one child (E. 5).

in the workhouse. D. 15 was in the workhouse with her mother as a child.
D. i6.-Twin brother of D. i8. Son of C. iI and C. I2. First sent to the Poor Law Schools, then to the North Hyde Industrial School. From there he went to Dr. Barnardo's Homes. They did not teach him any trade, but at i6 sent him to Canada as a cow boy. He worked his way back on a cattle boat fifteen years later, to see his brother, D. I7, who, however, was in India. He got employment in the Road Car Co. for six years as chaff-cutter. Then lost his job and did odd work until he came into the workhouse, where he 1till is at frequent intervals. Had four children, one illegitimate. Two children in industrial schools now and one in infirmary. Takes children out of industrial schools "because he is fond of them." Owing to schools having no powers of detention the head of the school has complained that "they cannot learn if they are so often taken out, especially in winter." The most likely explanation being that D. i6 uses them for begging purposes. D. i6 traces his bad luck to his steadiness and soft heart, which has led him to help others when he could ill afford it.
D. I7.-Born I878. His parents had out-relief and three children in Poor Law Schools; after parents' death four children chargeable. Was then sent, with his two brothers, to the Industrial School (the same school that four of his nephews and nieces are now at); from there he went into the xith or i2th Hussars, and was twelve years with them in India, where he died of pneumonia.

She and her husband and the three remaining children are 'now in the workhouse. Evidence states that the whole family, D. 22 included, are habitual drunkards.

the workhouse thirteen years. At the age of I9 he went into the workhouse to be treated for syphilis. Was a bricklayer by trade, but never kept his work: for some time lived by selling muffins, and other odd jobs. He married D. 25, and the result of his illness may be traced in the deaths of the first four children. He lived in the house of C. 41 for seven years, and knew D. 59 well, hence his adoption of her illegitimate child. D. 26 is in the workhouse now. In I892 he applied for relief, and the medical officer offered to admit him to the infirmary but he declined.
