An Estimate of the Future Population of England and Wales*

Introduction
IN 1944 THE Royal Commission on Population was set up in order to deter-

thereafter. (Male/Female ratio 1-06 throughout.)

2 Since the Royal Commission reported, this
method has continued to be used in preparing what may perhaps be described as the "official" projections of the population of England and
Wales. These are calculated in the Government Actuary's Department on bases arrived at in consultation with the General Register Office. A new projection is made each year starting from the Registrar General's estimates of the Total Population of men and women (including British Armed Forces at home and elsewhere but excluding Allied Forces in this country) in five-

The purpose of this paper is to discuss, with such a projection in mind, the most recent information available under the general headings mortality, fertility and migration, to reach decisions on a single most probable basis for projection, and to carry out the projection.

tinue but the results are on a smaller scale, and
latterly our extra years of life have been more
and more due to advances in medical knowledge and the increased availability of medical services. Thus the past trend has arisen from a variety of causes and this should be remembered when extrapolating into the future on a basis derived from an examination of past experience. Any future decline in death rates will depend largely on the outcome of difficult medical research; the simple life-saving methods cannot be expected to yield much more.

results of this analysis in a simple form which is
easy to comprehend and which can readily be used for extrapolation if necessary, a similar measure has been used to that in the "official"
projections, viz., the ratio of the mortality rate in twenty-five years' time to the present rate; this ratio might be called the "improvement factor". Table 1 below shows the twenty-fiveyear improvement factors calculated from the mortality rates in 1896-1900 (1898), 1936-40 (1938) and 1951-55 (1953) assuming the rates to improve exponentially:

7 The first step was to examine the trend of the mortality rates for each particular age group over past years, to fit a curve to each series of

figures and obtain the mortality rates in future
years by continuation of these curves. From an examination of the data it was clear that the improvement in mortality rates had not been linear, which is not surprising when one con-
siders that each successive reduction in the rate
of mortality leaves less scope for future improvement. This suggested that an exponential curve might be found more suitable, so to test this, a series of graphs ofthe logarithms of the mortality rates were drawn. In general, it was found that these produced fairly straight lines for a long period of years up to 1936-41 (say 1938), but since then the decline in mortality has been more rapid except at the older ages where a decline in
the war years was followed by a levelling off and, in some age groups, even by an increase.

Basis (A) covers the fairly stable period up to 1938 during which an exponential curve gives a good fit, so that this basis is close to representing the actual experience during the period as well as the rate of change over the forty years.
Basis (B) covers the period during which the introduction of new drugs and the comprehensive health service brought about a large fall in mortality rates. The very low factors at most ages on this basis illustrate this fall very clearly.
9 Although other more sophisticated methods of projection are available, the method used in the present paper will be the straightforward calendar year method and it remains to decide upon what degree of improvement seems probable in future for each aee group. The major Dart

Future Births-Factors Affecting Numbers of Births
14 It might at the outset be asked why the number of births in future years should be any different from the present annual numbers. At its briefest, the answer to this question is that the number of parents may change, or alternatively

that the numbers of children born to each parent may change. A third possibility is that a change may occur in the ages at which parents have their children. For example, if there is a trend towards earlier marriage and consequently earlier parenthood, then, other things being equal, the annual number of births will go up. Our task is there-

21 It is difficult to foresee the consequences of
(iii). At one extreme, the view could be taken
that there is, at marriage, such a thing as an intended completed family size which will be reached earlier than before, and that fertility at older ages and longer durations since marriage will decline in future in compensation; in other words, a "trend towards earlier parenthood" as mentioned in paragraph 14. At the other extreme, it might be assumed that fertility at later marriage durations will be unaffected, or even that it might go up in future on the grounds that these new cohorts will continue to experience higher fertility throughout their married life.
22 The decline apparent in the fertility rates for married women below age twenty and above age thirty calls for further examination and this can be obtained from Table KK in the Registrar General's Civil Volume which analyses fertility by duration of marriage as well as age of mother. It is found that the fertility rates have in fact increased at almost all durations of marriage so that the decline is due to a concealed higher average duration since marriage brought about by a past increase in marriage rates. (Table KK related to maternity rates for women married once only, but it is thought that a comparison based on these data is adequate for our purpose.)
Proportions Married
23 In order that we may be able to use in the estimates legitimate fertility rates specific for both age of mother and duration of marriage, we must arrange for the future numbers of women 15-44 to be split between single and married, and further, according to duration of

marriage. The proportions married in the required groupings in future years have been computed on three different bases:
(a) Assuming marriage rates remain at the 1952-57 level. These marriage rates were obtained from the proportions married in 1957 less the survivors of the proportions married in 1952 at an age five years younger adjusted approximately for widowhood and divorce.
(b) Assuming marriage rates remain at the 1957 level. This was a more accurate calculation in which factors were applied to the Net Nuptiality Table in the 1951 Census Fertility Volume so as to bring it to the level of the 1957 crude marriage rates.
(c) The proportions married above age twentyfive for all durations combined were taken as in (b). Below age twenty-five, the proportions were increased above (b) half way towards the much higher proportions obtaining in the United States of America in 1955.
24 The ultimate proportions married (which will not be reached for more than twenty-five years) on these bases are shown in Table 4.
It will be seen that all three bases produce a proportion married about 0 91 at ages 4044. When 4 or 5 per cent is added for widows and divorced, the proportion ever married becomes 95 per cent, which would appear to be about the maximum possible.
25 In order to bridge the gap between the present time and the ultimate marriage position, it is necessary to estimate the proportions married in age and duration groups in 1958. This has been done approximately by splitting the 1957 proportions married in the first column of Table 4 'by reference to the proportions' married in

A Net Reproduction Rate, being based on a single year's experience, is now generally regarded as unsatisfactory, and its place in fertility analysis has been taken by the generation replacement rate.

the rates at early durations of marriage. To show the effect of this, further work was done using the 1957 fertility rates at durations 0-4, ninetenths of the 1957 rates at durations 5-9, eight-tenths at durations 10-14 and seven-tenths
at higher durations. The result was a reduction of 6 or 7 per cent in the ultimate N.R.R.s based on 1957 fertility rates without adjustment. These reductions adopted for durations five and over are, of course, quite arbitrary.

33 If 1957 marriage rates are used in combination with 1957 fertility rates at short durations declining progressively at higher durations as in paragraph 29, an ultimate N.R.R. of 1P07 is obtained. This would be quite a reasonable basis to adopt; it is moderate in its assumptions both as regards marriage and fertility and could be justified on the experience of past years. On the other hand, it can be shown that the ultimate family sizes of women marrying at different ages

young ages have been increasing steadily since 1951-55, and they can reasonably be expected to go on increasing. It is a matter of opinion whether they will rise to the level implicit in basis (c) above, but the latter is still a good way short of the example set in the U.S.A. in 1955 and can hardly be called unrealistic.
