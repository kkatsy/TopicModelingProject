Facial Variation
Some Problems of Recording Shapes and Determining the Affinities of Human Populations by Means of Facial Differences, with Special Reference to the People of Tristan Da Cunha

THIS IS A first report of our investigations into
the methodology of facial variation in human
populations. The project was stimulated by the fact that facial shape is one of the most variable areas, morphologically, in man, and yet methods of studying this region are dismally inadequate. We feel that the basic anthropometric measurements generally employed in the field far from "cover" facial variation. Indeed, many shape differences of the head are now traditionally recorded by non-metrical (anthroposcopic) tabulation. This visual and subjective appreciation of much facial variation can be traced back to the nineteenth century, and the various schemes originally given by Paul Topinard22 (in 1885) for classifying, for example, nasal bridge form and nostril shape, still occur monotonously in some recent publications. What Topinard and others did for anthropology, Bertillon1 (in 1896) did for criminal identification, but the police were lucky enough to be able to abandon all (or nearly all) for the sake of fingerprints.
The present inquiry is part of a broader critical study which is being undertaken on various "non-metrical" polygenic variables of the body surface, as a contribution to the International Biological Programme. New photographic data on the people of Tristan da Cunha became available to us towards the beginning of this inquiry and our first exercise has been to compare these with a number of photographic series already published in monographs. Unfortunately, there are very few publications which reproduce series of standard photographs of a sufficiently high quality to be used in our comparative study.
As regards the head region of the Tristanians, no less than three series of photographs have

been taken, accounting for the great majority of the group. Only in one case, however, are the head positions rigidly standardized, and these have received our special attention. For further references to this important island group, one is referred to Munch,15 Thomsen,21 Sognnaes'9
and Black, Thacker, Lewis and Thould.2 Our work on the Tristanians has been to a large
extent a matter of two dimensional geometry
combined with a three dimensional appreciation of the morphological differences. It may at first sight appear to be very divorced from field work, but in fact it hits hard at some of the basic problems concerned with recording and studying
morphological variation in man. The complex
nature of shape differences in man make it quite impossible to cope adequately with such
variation in the field and, even when time permits a basic series of body measurements to
be taken, photogrammetric anthropometry (Dupertuis and Tanner,7 Gavan, Washburn and Lewis,9 Tanner and Weiner20) is the only hope of recording much of the variation. But the use of photographic methods produces its problems. To refer back to the Tristan head photographs, we have already mentioned that head positioning was not satisfactory in two series. This is a
common and serious problem in field photographs, and the detailed study by Ehrhardt8 of photographic distortions demonstrates clearly the great difficulty in using such data. Also, in none of this data was scaling of sufficient precision placed near the subjects, with the result that indices and angles had to be defined as the
only alternative to absolute measurement. This
exercise in how to compare photographic data where exact scaling is not known, has been very useful however. Firstly, because nearly all earlier

monographs which include series of photographs fall into this category, and secondly becausewhatever recommendations we make-it is more than likely that much future data will also be
similarly unscaled! Although it would have been most useful and
pertinent to compare the Tristanians with English, Italian and Southern African hybrid groups, we have had to make the best of Weninger's25 excellent African Negro series and North European standard head photographs taken by Bryn and Schreiner.5 To give a broader view to the comparison, and in view of the fact that individuals of mongoloid affinities may have left their genetic mark on the island, we have also included comparisons with the mongolian series of Yokoh-Yasuo.26 Most aspects of facial variation-such as facial height and bigonial breadth-which are already dealt with by standard antropometric methods are not included in our study, although recourse was made to one or two of these as they were needed in the calculation of certain indices. Only males are included in this study.
We have considered, only to reject, any nonmetrical classification of facial shape as a whole. The early scheme of P5chl6 in 1916 and the more elaborate recent one of Watanabe24 in 1960 both seem to us cumbersome, extremely subjective and time-consuming. At the other extreme, the work of Karl Pearson and colleagues on detailed facial contouring (McLearn, Morant and Pearson'3) necessitates a spider's web of measurements which would reach astronomical proportions if other parts and planes of the face were considered.* Our choice has been to study a select number of variables which seemed most likely to show the more major and common features of facial variation and which are usually considered non-metrically; also to consider such variables separately as much as possible. In their recent study of the hereditary aspects of the craniofacial complex in triplets, Kraus, Wise and Freill have emphasized the
* We are aware of the fact that the detailed analysis of numerous facial contours is being reconsidered at present by a number of researchers, but clearly such complex comparisons will always demand very considerable computational assistance, which may well place such methods outside the realms of most general investigations for some years to come.

importance of studying parts of the face, rather than attempting to analyze total facial patterns.
Variation within the Group
Before considering the position of the Tristanians in relation to certain other human populations, a few words are first needed on variation within the group. It was noticed early on that certain variants, which defied anything but nonmetrical scoring, possibly demonstrated characteristics of facial profile peculiar to certain families. It was therefore of interest to know if any family relationship could be demonstrated from a study of inter- and intra-family variations in the measurements we had made and which had been expressed graphically. To answer this question, a sample of adult males was taken from three of the larger families: Green, Glass and Rogers.
Confining our study to the nose and protrusion of the ears, measurements of nasal height, nasal index, nasal prominence and ear protrusion index were plotted by families (for definitions of measurements used see Figure 1 and the Appendix). The results were disappointing for in none of the diagrams was there any sign of family clustering for these variables. However, the samples were relatively small and, in the absence of radiographic information it was not possible to study both the skeletal and soft tissue variations of the face-which might have been more rewarding. Moreover, it was thought that any "family likeness" noted from purely visual inspection of the photographs might be attributed to more subtle variations in nasal bridge curvature, set and shape of the eyes and shape of the lips which were outside the scope of our present inquiry on more well defined facial variants.
Nasal Measurements
Of the regions of the face showing marked variation in man, the nose has perhaps received the most detailed attention, though few measurements have ever been defined. Nasal shape, moreover, depends upon a number of separate factors: length of the nose and breadth of the nasal wings, nasal prominence, shape of the

differences occur relative to the horizontal plane cutting through the lower nasal point (that is, subnasale). These differences are seen in Figure 6, and it is fairly obvious that the Tristan group has frequencies for the wing/septum variants most similar to the European sample, with more divergent values from the Negro and mongoloid series.

Wing/Septum varieties
FIGURE 6 Tentative scoring of differences in nasal wing and septal
relationships. +/_ values indicate positions above or below horizontal line (drawn through apex of nasolabial angle). 0/, 0/0, /0 values indicate that nasal contour runs along the horizontal (one or both sides of the angle apex).
Excluding the nose, the prominences and recessions of the face-particularly as seen in the medial plane-seem to us best considered in four divisions: prominence or slope of the frontal (frontal angle), upper facial prominence (nasal base angle), upper lip prominence (upper lip angle), and chin prominence or recession (chin angle).
Frontal and Chin Angles
Considering first the upper and lower zones of the face, the next figure gives the frontal and chin angles. In the top diagram of Figure 7, there is for the most part a separation of Negro and Tristan values. The Northern Europeans

are well scattered, but it is interesting to note that the Tristanians display more low frontal angles than the Europeans. In the lower diagram the Tristan group show generally lower frontal angle values and greater chin angles. This is in fact the reverse of what we had anticipated by casual inspection, and clearly suggests that upper and lower facial recession may be more characteristic of non-Negro and non-mongoloid populations.
In the middle face, marked human variation can occur depending upon the degree of upper facial flatness and the considerable differences in upper alveolar prognathism. In the left scatter diagram of Figure 8, the Negro scatter pattern is well separated, with Tristan values showing slightly more of an inclination towards the Negro value than the Northern European group. In the right diagram, the mongoloid group shows some degree of separation-but by no means complete-from the Tristan scatter. It will be seen that some Tristan and mongoloid values are negative for the nasal base angle, but owing to more alveolar prognathism in the Asiatics, they do not present any negative values for upper lip angle, as in the Tristan people.
Alveolar prognathism, whether of the upper or lower jaws is, of course, affected by incisor positioning, malocclusion and tooth loss. We have been well aware of this fact in our analyses and, having access to some of Professor G. L. Slack's dental records on the Tristanians, have been able to check on the males we have included in this study. We have also noted the orthodontic findings of Heffer and Lovius.10 As it happens, all those showing considerable anterior tooth loss were females. Although there was a range of incisor bites, from fairly well-marked overbite to some degree of underbite, none of these incisor relationships was deemed so abnormal as to demand exclusion from our present series.
Eyes and Eyelids
The morphology of the eyelids, that is, the folds and grooves, vary considerably in some world populations, particularly in Southern African and mongoloid communities. The systematization of these structures has been attempted by various workers, and most recently

by Tubaki.23 In the case of the Tristan people, there is relatively little variation in eyelid morphology, although there is some difference in the fullness and height of the upper palpebral lobe. Semi-epicanthic structures were noted in two children, but as these can occur in Europeans-particularly in children-no particular significance can be given to these cases.
The distances between outer and inner corners of the eyes (Biocular and Inter-ocular diameters) were compared in the Tristan, West African and North European groups. Comparison with the mongoloid group was restricted to biocular diameter as presence of the epicanthic fold (obscuring the inner margin of the lachrymal caruncle) in some cases made precise measurement between inner corners of the eyes impossible. The range of variation in all groups was considerable and although the West African group showed a higher mean value for both inter- and bi-ocular diameters the ranges in three of the groups overlapped almost completely. Morevoer, although the Tristan mean value for biocular distance was higher than that of the North Europeans the situation was the reverse when inter-ocular distance was considered.
Lip Variation
Lips show much variation in man, particularly as regards height and degree of eversion. Methods of recording such variation have differed widely, physical anthropologists tending to favour visual scoring of lip form. In orthodontic research, however, there is a growing awareness of the need to study this region of the face far more precisely than in the past, and to consider external appearance in relation to internal bone structure. For example the work of Sarnas18 on sixty-two Scandinavian families may be noted, and it can be seen from his thorough analysis, the metrical detail which must be considered if this facial area is to be seriously dealt with in civilized or in primitive populations. In the absence of cranio-facial radiographs of the Tristan people, we have in this study to fall back on visual inspection and the consideration of simple breadth and height values. Surprisingly, although by visual scoring,

some of the Tristan people appeared to have very full Negro-like lips, this does not show up in the lip index (Figure 5). It will be seen that in the vertical dispersion of this diagram, the Negros occupy the upper index range, with the other groups mainly showing lower values. Perhaps a little significance can be attached to the fact that of the Tristan/European index values, the Tristan scatter shows more overlap over the lower part of the Negro range.
The Shape of the Ear
Variations in the shape of the ear, although numerous, are causing us much trouble. To begin with, there are few published series of ears available for study, and even where photographic data are at hand, differences in lighting in some cases obscure important detail. The definition of precise points is also by no means easy, and it is some consolation to us that members of the Pediatric Research Unit at Guy's Hospital-who are currently studying facial variation in mongolism (Dawbarn and Joseph6), have run into similar trouble. In actual fact, by defining a base line, at least twenty basic measurements can be taken on the ear although beyond an experimental study it would be too laborious to consider such a number. But there is a further problem. The majority of ear photographs which are available-and this includes the Tristan series-are in the lateral head plane, and such a view does not take into account the degree of ear protrusion. Moreover, distortions which result from such lateral photography are likely to differ with the region of the ear. To determine the extent of the differences between lateral ear views and photographs taken at right angles to the major plane of the ear (that is, through meatus and outer iim), we have studied in detail some twenty measurements on a number of subjects where both views are available. Some of the differences found in just four of these dimensions are seen in Figure 9. It is clear that although most values taken on the 3/4 head (that is ear plane) view are greater than those for the lateral aspect, this is not always the case.
Thus, for the moment, the only ear dimension which we considered to be sufficiently stable to permit comparison and fuller mention here was

given in Figure 4. The groups show quite marked variation but not a great separation for this character, with the mongoloids displaying the greatest spread. The Negro sample shows a tendency to slightly lower values, that is, less ear protruberance than the others. In this case, the Tristan distribution is similar to that for
the Northern Europeans.

purely experimental ground-work. As a result of this inquiry we do feel strongly that there is a need for a reconsideration of previous anthropometric work on the face and a greater appreciation of the value of facial radiography in the field. Even by using simple indices and angles derived from standard unscaled head photographs, it has been possible to demonstrate considerable variation in four selected human populations, including the Tristanians. In the case of the latter group, it is encouraging to find that although they are facially more similar to the European than other series studied, there are some differences, and in some respects they may show some affinities to the Negro series.
Whatever choice of facial characteristics or measurements may be preferred by a particular researcher, the study serves to emphasize the importance of standard head photographs (especially facial and lateral) as valuable anthropological field records.

Conclusions

Our work on various methodological problems related to living populations was initially supported by a grant from the Eugenics Society (DRB), and continued with a further grant from the Medical Research Council (RGH). Grateful thanks are extended to these institutions. We should also like to thank Dr. Harold Lewis, Professor J. S. Weiner and Professor G. L. Slack for providing the unprocessed photographic data. Miss Theya Molleson and Miss Shirley Jarman were also of great help during some parts of this investigation, and Mrs. I. Copeland continued to give her best in secretarial assistance. Last, but not least, Mr. J. H. Musgrave kindly provided the metrical data on ear distortion related to photographic positioning.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

Lateral (Profile) View In the absence of radiographic information, it was
found, by experiment, that a line drawn at 100 to the horizontal passing, respectively, through the upper margin of the external auditory meatus and the outer corner of the eye orientated the head in a position closely corresponding to the natural carrying position.
Full Face View The head was orientated horizontally about the
outer corners of the eyes.
General Facial Size The General Facial Size factor in terms of which,
in the absence of reliable scaling, many of the measurements were expressed as indices, was computed from a sum of the following measurements:
1. The distance between top of ear-hole and outer corner of eye.
2. Lower Facial Height: the distance between nasion and the point on the fleshy tissue of the chin corresponding to gnathion.
3. The maximum measurement from the top of the ear-hole to the most prominent point of the chin.

Frontal Recession Angle. At a point on the upper margin of the external auditory meatus, lines at 110 to 25° to Ref. Line 1. are drawn to intersect the frontal region (or a projection of it if the hair line is low). The angle of frontal recession is that angle subtended by a line between the two points of frontal intersection and the horizontal.
Full Face Bizygomatic Diameter. The maximum horizontal
breadth of the face between the most laterally projecting bones of the cheek.
Ear Protrusion, or Maximum Biaural Breadth. The maximum horizontal breadth between the most lateral margins of the ears.
Ear Protrusion Index. Bizygomatic Diam./Max. Biaural Br.
Inter-Ocular Diameter. Distance between inner corners of the eyes.
Biocular Diameter. Distance between outer corners of the eyes.
Lip Height. Vertical distance between the highest point of the upper lip and bottom of the lower when lips are in the resting position together.
Lip Breadth. Maximum distance between corners of the lips (when facial expression is "at rest").
