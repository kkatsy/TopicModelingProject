THE BIRTH RATE CHANGES
Stockholm 'Upper' Classes More Fertile Than The ' Lower'
By KARL ARVID EDIN, Ph.D.

T HE' upper ' classes of Greater Stockholm are now having larger families than are the ' lower.' This fact is in
striking contrast with the position in London and, as far as I know, the other great capitals
of the civilized world. Everywhere else
fertility falls steadily as social class rises. In Stockholm itself it appears to be a com-
paratively recent change. I have already given a short preliminary
account* of my researches into the fertility of marriages in Stockholm in the years 1919-22. It was made by means of birth-

gives the results of this research, enlarged to include the whole of Greater Stockholm (with nearly half a million inhabitants in
I920).
While the higher fertility of the wealthier classes is most remarkable in the marriages contracted during the war, the differences between the two income groups are statistically significant for all marriages except the most recently contracted (I9I9-20).
The reader will also notice how remarkably low is the fertility of all groups in comparison with that in other countries.

My next step was to analyze the fertility of all married couples in the years I92I-22 alone, dividing them up into three social classes: (i) industrial workers, (2) others with incomes less than 6,ooo crowns, and
(3) those with incomes of at least 6,ooo
crowns. Besides grouping according to duration of marriage, I subdivided the wives
into four age-groups-under 25, 25-30, 3035, and 35-40. As before, I calculated the
births to be expected in (3) if fertility was
the same as in (i), and then compared it with the actual number recorded. Table 6
gives the results. In this study a reasonable time had
elapsed since the most recent marriages (I919-20), a fact which accounts for the more marked difference between Class 1 and
Class 3. It should be noted, however, that all living children, illegitimate as well as legitimate, born (to the same women) in
i91g and I920, are included in the figures
in Table 5, which raises the fertility of Class 1. Here, in Table 6, the illegitimate are excluded. The percentages of excess in Table 6 are statistically significant for all three marriage-duration groups.

For i920 I had the exact date of marriage recorded on all family-cards for the city proper, and also the exact dates of all confinements. Stillborn children were included; and I made a record (again, with exact dates) of all illegitimate children born (within nine months before marriage) in I9I9 and I920 to women married during I920. Table 7 gives the results for two social classes. I have excluded wives who had not lived in Stockholm for at least two years since marriage; and I have counted as childless those wives who had had no children within two years after marriage.

three-age groups are:

in Class B 65 per cent. I dare not say whether or not these figures can be taken as supporting Professor Gini's hypothesis* that there is a physiological half-sterility (" weakening of genetic instincts ") which follows a voluntary limitation of births.

If born between 19I4-I9I8, could fairly be they are omitted, the A and B percentage assumed to be the children of those wives, rises to 57, C to 92.

The fact that the income of the husbands of the ' upper ' classes generally rises more with rising age than does the income of the ' lower ' class husbands, is probably an
inducement to a more even distribution of births. They tend to postpone family burdens until they are richer; but the working class would rather prefer to shoulder the
burdens while they can, during youth and good wages. Figures illustrating this fact are given in Table 18.

The employment of women is another factor which appears to have great influence
upon fertility. Table 14 shows the amount of employment among the four incomeclasses of Table 13. In Table 15 I give the actual numbers of children born to (a)
the unemployed wives, and (b) the employed in each of the same four classes, and compare them with the ' expected ' numbers-
i.e., the fertility of all classes combined, represented as ioo. Only Class D, the wealthiest, is not sub-divided into unemployed and employed wives, because the difference between tlhe two is negligible. Their combined fertility is the highest of all above expectation. In classes A and B

the fertility of the employed is little more
than half expectation or than half of that of
the unemployed wives in the same classes.
In Class C (6,ooo-io,ooo crowns) the fer-
tility of the employed is nearly 30 per cent.
below expectation, and that of the unemployed io per cent. above. All rates have been standardized according to the twelve marriage-duration and age-groups mentioned at the bottom of column i, page 259. I regret that without prolonged further analysis of my material I cannot give the number of wives. But their total years of marriage, as given in the Tables, answer the purpose sufficiently well.

Method of Identification.

266 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

The Swedish Census is founded (at least since i86o), on the continuous registering (by the clergy) of the births, deaths, marriages, and migrations (including all migra-
tions between the parishes) in a special church-book (" forsamlingsboken," the Parish Register). For the last Census of
I920 this material is supplied with the de-
clarations of income of each inhabitant. These declarations are identified and inserted in the ordinary Census material. In
Stockholm, we have no parish registers, but only lists of taxpayers (" mantalslingderna "). These are also checked with the help of the registers of migration. (See
League of Nations' Statistical Handbooks, Series No. 6, page 20.)
For each marriage, where the woman was aged below forty years at the date of the Census (December 3ISt, I920) and lived with

her husband in Stockholm at that date, I have extracted a family-card, and for each confinement in these marriages during the years I9I9-22 a birth-card. The latter
returns I have identified and inserted in the family cards. For the years I92I-22 I have also noted the migrations from Greater
Stockholm of all such couples registered on family-cards, and also all deaths and divorces (taken from the respective registers)i and inserted them in my family-cards. Thus, the space of time of observation (years of marriage) is perfectly correct. I
have succeeded in identifying practically
all confinemenzts on my family-cards. I believe that this method of identification is
the only rational method for investigations
on the differential fertility of the income
and social classes.
