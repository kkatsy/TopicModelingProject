RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INTELLIGENCE OF TECHNICAL college
students and size of family
By F. W. WARBURTON and E. C. VENABLES

H IMMELWEIT1 found a significant correlation of -I33 between size of family and composite score in four
verbal and non-verbal tests of intelligence
for 408 students at the London School of Economics. Leybourne - White 2 3 at Manchester University obtained correlations
of r = + 025 between the untimed versions of the I938 Matrices non-verbal test and size of family (862 students) and r = -073 between the Moray House Adult 2 test and size of family (700 students). Venables4 of the School of Education, Manchester University, found an r of -05I between size of family and the I947 version of the Matrices test for 48I technical college students, and Wilcockson4 of the Department of Education, Manchester University, obtained an r of -04I between size of family and the untimed version of the I938 Matrices test. The latter four correlations are non-
significant. Venables has recently extended her sample
of technical college students to I,004. The correlation between size of family and the 1947 Matrices test for this group is -0173, which is non-significant, i.e. effectively zero. Mean test scores are:
