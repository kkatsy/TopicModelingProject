THE SEX RATIO AT BIRTH.
By S. DE JASTRZEBSKI.
IN a,dding yet another (to. the innumerable contributions that have been made to the study of the inequality of the sex ratio at birth, my object is a simple and humble one, yet one of paramount importaince. It is to provide, as far as I am able, data sufficiemtly oomplete and farreaching as to justify some definite conclusions on this much debated question.
In my o-wn fraggmentary reading on the subject I have been, ihnpressed by
the light-heartied way in which most of those who have dealt wi,th it have basoed theiTr theories on, and drawn their conclusions from, material so silight as to afford no reasonaible ground for any definite deduction. Moreaver, much of -this inadequate material is open to grave suspicion as to its relhiability, much of it is out of date, and much oif it is not available for iinvestigation and check.
And, wi,th al,l respect for the und;oubted abi'lity of many of the d,istinguished men who have written, on this subject, I am surprised that in so many cases the evident desire to bolster up some precouncei.ved id.ea has warped their critical faculty and obscured 'their perception. For my own part, I have no theories to advance, no past explanations to justify, noi special school of statisticians to uphold or attack. In. the main I loock upon, what I have read on the subject rather in the light of "a hodrid warning and true-hearted example " of what to; avo,id, than of a, lamp of knowledge by which to guide my way. Practically the whole of the figuires which I give have been collected by myself during the last few yea,rs, an-d have been taken from the official statistical publications of the countTries n1afmed, and in most cases the number oif births is given so that the extent of the data can be seen. The range of my inquiry is a very restricted one, for I ha.ve confined it (almost entirely to matters concerning which the .mass of material available was sufficient Tto warrant some' definite conclusion from the fac.ts presenited.
In the first place it may be granted that, so fa,r as we know, there is a, preponderznce of males born throughout the human race. This p,reponder;ance of males at birth is, however, not equally spread; thhere is a faixly consi.derable variation in its amount, a variation apparently due not tot one but to a variety of causes. The first object, therefore, in collecting data on which to determine these causes is to present them in
such a way as to neutralise. as far as possible the effect of causes other than the one under consideration. This may be doone in two ways, by widening as fa,r as possible the area from which our data is assembled, and by presenting it with the other conditions which may affect the results, as far as possible equal.
Most writers agree that race is a factor and an. iinpartant one in its effect otn masculinity at birth. Yet i.n the maiin they have based their conclusions on figures relating to pollitical divisions .rather than' on racial

8 EUGENICS REVIEW.

ones. I am wnell aware that such a thing as a pure race; is sadly to seek, and that the ordinarily accepted racial terms applied to Eur-opean: niations are quite misleading. We a-re for the most part quite content to describe the French, for example, as being a La.tin race, altho,ugh as a matter of fact they aire probably the most comnposite of all the nmations of the wo,rld. But thiere. are certain r.acial distinctions still fai,rly well preseirved by some of ,tthe peoples of the world, even in Europe, and o,f the count,ries for -which istatistics -aire available that congeries of raices which mra;de up the Empire of Austria, now fa.lling i;nt;o, its separaite p.arts, presents tbhe best field for our inquiry. For be it noted we have here in, some oir other of the provinces of the empi,re populiaitions o,f which a great majority beloings to some peopile with more or less cleairly d,ifferentilated racial characteristics. The late-st figures at my command a,re those rela-ting to th.e three years I904, I907 and I9IO, a,nd from them I have extracted the particulars for the several provinces o.f (i) Dalmatia with a prepondemrating Serbo-Ciroatt populaition, (2) Upper anid Lower Au,stria, miaiinly
Germa,ns, (3) Bohemia a-nd Moravia, mainly Czechs, or as they a-re now
styled, Czecho-Slovako., (4) Galicia, predominantly Polish, an!d (1) the
" Kiistenlande," predominantly Italialn. In additioni, I give the figures for the Jews throughout the Empire.

This table then dieals with a va!riety of racial, ra,ther than national, divisions, all within the same politicail bound-ary, living under condiitions which are strictly comparable, and these show a well-maTrked vairiation
in the degree of masculinity. As to, the relative masculinity of the white and bl.ack races thoe
materiial available i's not very extensive, but it all points to a lower male
ra,tio, at birtih among the blacks. In the Cape Colony (in.clu,ding Bechuainalan,d and Pondoland), during the years 1904-8 inclusive, the ratio of m,ales iin ioo,ooo whliite births recorded was 1,054, w;hile in ioo,ooo births. of natives it was only 1,026. In those areas of .the United States i.n which registrationi of births obtains, for which the first set of statistics (foir the year I915) has recently appeared, the ratio, of male to female births amo.ng whites (700,ooo births) was 1,057, while among the negroes (12,000 biir;ths) it just failed to reach i,ooo. In. New York City for the quinquennium I907-II the respective ratiios of masculiinity wvere, whites

(700,000 births) I,045, negroes (io,ooo births) i,oi6; in New Orleans for the y,eatrs 19I4-15 they were, whites (I2,000 births) 1,020, negro-es (4,000
bitrths) 982; amd in the District of Columbia for the four years 19I3-I6, 'whites (20,000 births) I,050, negroes (9,ooo births) i,ooo. It wil.l be seen from these figures that in every case for which I have been able t4 obtain comparative statisti.cs the, masculinity is lower among nlegroes 'hian among whites inhabiting the same arTeas. Further, in the West Indies,
where the colou,red population is in; an ovenvhelming preponde'rance,
masculinity is,decidedly lower than in any European country. Thus in the Isiland of St. Vincent for the decade 1905-14 it was I,021, while in Triniida,d for the quinquensium I9II-I5, excluding the East Indian element, it oinly reached 901.
Again, in Ceylon, where thiree main racia.l divisions are recognisedthe Sinhalese, the Tamnils and the Moo-rs-the ratiol of m,ale to female births in 1914 wa,s 1,037 for the two former and I,063 for the last-name.d. In the Japanese Empire there is the small and curiously distinct race of the Aiinos: of Hokkaido, among whom during the decade I904-13 masculi.nity at birth was only 1,004 as compared with 1,046 among the Japanese.
Final.ly, let us turn to our Indian Empire presenting as it does the most bewildering va.riety -of r.aicial types in its enormouls population. There is of course an equally bewildering vauriety oif opinion as to how these type.s should be classified, but for our purpose this is immaterial. All that is ess,ential from our point of vieew i's that it is universally recog,nised that these racial differences exist, their olassification doe:s noit) affect our argument. Accepiting on these grou-nds Risieley's divi,siotn. oif the races inhabiting India, viz.: Dravidian, Mongolo-Dravidian, Scvthio-
Dravidian, Aryo-IDravidian, Mongoloid, Indo-Aryain, anod Turco-Iranian, I have in Table II. dealt with the births registered in the three yearTs 19I2-13-14 in certain provinces in which one or other of these types is
largely represented.

Here again it will be seen that the same result is shown as in Table I., with a much wider range of differentiation. From the figures given, which deaal with very laJrge; numbers of births in widely-separated parts of
the world, but so grouped as to make them truly comparable, we may surely accept as proven the conclusion that rae is an important factor in determining the relative degree of masculinity ait birth.
In their very interesting and unbiassed' paper on "The variations in
masculinity under different conditions " read by Messrs. J. N. and C. J. Lewis to -the Institute of Actuaries on January 29th, I906, the authors went further and arrived at the conclusion that cross-breeding raise-s masculin,ity. The evidence on which this conclusion was based related to the cty of Buenos AireE for the decade I884-I893. The numbers of
births are not given, but obviously they cannot be very large. The evidenoe on this point which I have been able to collect is not very extensive, but it is very considerably greater than that at the command
of Messrs. Lewis, and is shown in, Table III.

The results are curiously contradictory. In each area there is greater oir lesser variation in the masculinity of the children botrn to native, foreign. and mixed parents and in each the masculinity of the children born to foreign parents is higher than. that to native. But with *tho.se of mixed parentage it wil be seen that iin the first area (Unted States, 1915) the masculinity is considerably lower tchan that of either the foreign or native, in' the second (New York City, I907-I I) it its considerably higher, whiile in Uruguay (I912-I3-15-I6-17) it is higher than the native but considerably lower than. the f-oreign.
For the city of Rig de Ja%neiro I have the figuires of the births of whites, mulattoes and negroes for the six years 1910-15. These relate to IO9,000 births, of which go,ooo were thiose of whites, I5,000 of mulattoes,

and 4,ooo of negroes. The -respective ratios of males to females were,
white I,049, mulaittoes 979, negroes 999. Here the cross between black
an-d white xraces has resulted in a decided lowering o;f the ratio of masculinity of boxth the oTiginal stocks, as is also the case in British Guian:a (see Table III.). For the present, therefore, the question must be relegated to the large number of those for which the restricted nature of material renderrs any definite conclusion, unsafe. If I may hazard a, personal opinion it is that the. effect of cross-breeding on the masculinity of the offsp.ring .probably depends on the nature of the cross, and that it may be either positive, negative or neutral.
On the question of the variation in masculinity at birth as affected by legitimacy or illegi,timacy there is a mass of material now available, aid in Table.s IV. and V. I have collected recent statistics dealing with many millions of births.

It will be seern that while in the mass masculinity is higher in the children born in wedi;lock, this i.s not universally the case. Among the European countries shown in the table the illegitimates ha.ve a highieir masculinity in Noirway, Sweden, Scotland and Spaim, and -the same ph-enomenon is shown in the figures for Uruguay, while in E,ngland aind Wales, Austria and Denmark the ratios are very neearly equal. But to be of any reall value it is necessary to know not 'the numbers born in or out of legal wedlock, but what births -are the results of casual union. In the figures given a varying but probably considerable proportion of the
births classed as those of illegitimates are the results of unioins wthich,
although inott ecognised by the la.w oT the Church, are from the physi,ologi,cal point of view mar,ri,ages. This consideration' mus.t materially discount any conclusions which might be drawn from t,he figures piresented. To determine what beaTring, if any, prorniscuious as compared wi,th perm.anent unions exercise on- masculilnity requires knowledge which
we do noit possess.
On the question of masculinity in urban as compared with rural ar-eas Miessrs. Lewis in the p,aper already cited gave figures for a number of Europiean couaitiries (Scotlanid, Germany, Fraince, Belgium, Sweden anid Norway), which show in every clase a higher ratio, of masculinity in the births occurring in the rural areas. In Table VI. I have extended the area of investigation by citing some European countries not given by thiem and what is o;f considerably greater in,terest, including some figures
for America and Africa.

In every case there is a higher ratio for the rural than the urb.an
aire-as, anid the evi?dence oin this point iis sufficient to warrant the definite
conclusion that urbanisation loiwers masculinity. On the questioin of primp,geniture I have little to ad.d to what has al,ready been written. The only ne.w figures given by the brothers Lewis are those .reliatiing to Scot-
land for thie ye.ar 1855, the first year in whi,ch civil registratioin obtained
in that country, and these must be taken with some reserve. Bertillion?s
oft-quoted figures for Austria. appear to me quite grotesque, while Stieda's for Alsace-Lorraine give a lower masculin.ity for the first than foTr later births. The only recent an.d reliable contribution to our klnowled-ge on this point is that given by Knibbs for the Australian Commonwealth, viz.: I,052 for the first and i,o5o for subsequent births. Th-e only n,ew
figures I have been able to compile personally relate to the city of Budapest for the four years 1905-8. These relate to only 6o,ooo biriths
an;d the respective ratios are I,05 I for first and 1,049 for subsequent
births. This result iit will be seen is in striking conifornity with thait obtained by Knibbs. The maiterial for a comprehensive investigatikn ,on
this poi,nt is, however, not yet available, and all that I am prepaTred to assert is that the evidence points to masculinity being slightly higher among the first born. It is nearly a century ago that Hofacker propounded his theory that the sex proportion at birth was materially, if not mainly, affected by the relative ages of the parents, masculinity being great-er where tihe father is older than the mother an:d less when the reverse i.s the case. The history of this theory is inteiresting and instruc-
tive. Hofacker founded it on observations confined to I996 births. In the followirng year (1830) Sadler investigated 2,o68 birtbs in this counitry, found confirmatoTy results and on this exiguous basis the so-called " Hofacker-Sadl-er law " held the field for many years. It received its first serious attack from Stieda, w%ho, investigating over ioo,ooo biirths in

14 EUGENICS REVIEW.
the sevelnties, obtained resuilts absolutely opposed to those of Hofacker and Sadler. But the l.aw died hard and has, I believe, its adherents sti.ll. Messrs. Lewis give, a fairly comprehensive list of -the various supporters -ad opponents of the law. Those whose investigations are favourable include Hofacker, Sadler, Goehlert, Legoyt, Boulenger, Oehrn,, Boeckh and Lewis, and the births brought under review numbered 325,448. On the other side were Noirot, Bre.slau, Stieda, Berner and Schumann, who brought 579,384 births under review. Thus the weight of evidence was decidedly against. But in no single case had any one of these investigators a sufficient mass of material to warrant any decisive conclu,sion. The Austrian records for the three yeaxrs 1904, 1907 and I9I0, so frequently referred to in this paper, gave me the opportuni,ty of investigating the point on a really large scale, as the data as to relative ages of the parents a-re available in no fewer than 1,436,762 births. The results show that where the father was older than the mother the ratio' of male to female biirths was I,055, whee the reverse was the case I,057. Thus at the first -test on a fully adequate scale the Hofacker-Sadler law is conclusively shown to be no law.
T'he theory, however, which probably excites most interest at the present momenit is that as to whether war h-as any effect on the male ratio at birth. A number of eminent statistical authorities have maintained that during wars the male ratio is sensibly increased, among them Ploiss, Dilsiing, Oettingen, Geddes, Mayr, Revelli and Raubier. No-ne of these, however, hias very convincing data to go on, Dfising's figures relating -to the war between Sweden and Russia (1789-90) are confined to Sweden and are the best of the lot. On the other hand, Lexis and Carlberg failed to finid any influence of war, and von Fircks maintains that the mnale ratio is actually lowered. Gini, in his exhaustive work, "Il sesso dal punto dci vista statistico," summarises his conclusions thus: "In conclusion, any relation between war and the sex ratio at birth appears to us moore than doubtful. The coincidences observed by Diusing, and by Oettiingen, as wel.l as those met with by ourselves in Serbia, may be calmly regarded as acci-dental " ('p. 240). And on paige 248 he goes even further and writes: " L' anormalitk del rapporto dei sessi durante e d4opo le guerre e categoricamente smentita." In a recent paper read before the Royal Statistical Society, Nixon, investigating the effects of the Austro.-Prussian war of i866, and the Franco-German war of i870, arrived at the same conclusion. The data on which both the supporters anJ opponents of Diising's theory worked were in every case ludicrously inadequate. The presen.t war will, when all the figures become available, first put thiis theory to the decisive test. Meantime, Sir Bernard Mallet, iln his presidential -address to the Royal Statistical Society last year, has drawn attention to the remarkable figures relating to' war births in the Uni.ted Kingdom. These figures I am now aible to carry oi. to a later date and to supplement by some relating to our ove;rseas dominions, to Hungary, Finland, and to some of the neutral countries in immediate contiguity to the area of military operation's. These are set out in Table VII.

From thi,s table it will be seen, that in seven of the belligerent
countries, wi,th over 3i millions of births unider review, thbere has been
in every case a rise in mascul.inity more or less marked, and that in those for which the figures cover moere than on,e year of war biarhs, i.e., of conceptions since the outbreak of war, the rise in masculinity is pronounced. Anid this ri-se is reflected in the Netherlands, Switzerland and Denmark, the three neutral countries nearest to tthe actual zone of military operations. To say the least, the results are remarkable for their unanimity, and warrant the conclusion that so far as the British Empire
is concerned, the effect of war has been to increase masculinity at birth to an appreciable extent. The volume of evidence is greatly in excess
of tat on which most of the theories as to what does or does not affect -the ratio of msasculinity at birth have hitherto been based, and, moreover, it is all on one side. But, before asserting that the application is un.iversal, it will be well to await the fuller figures which may be available at the end of the war.
I have no theory to account for this increase of masculinity in wartimze, but there is no lack of them from other sources. One widely held is that wax itself is not a cause, but the hairdships and privations which war entails on the belligerent peoples. As far as the British populations
are concer-ned this may be rued out odf oourt at once. Major Darwin and Sir ShiTley Murphy favour the idea that, as masculinity is hiigh.er among the first born and a-s war births include an unusually large pro-
portion of first births, this may be the determining cause. Gxanting th-at the higher masculinity of the first born its proven, this would, on wha.t

i6 EUGENICS REVIEW.
Knibbs ha,s established for Australia and I for Budapest, account for but a small firaction of the recorded increase. Normally, a,bout 25 per cent. of bir.ths are thos-e of first born children, and even if we allow double th.-t propoirtion the ra.ti,o would not be raised by one. Yet in England there is a. rise of six, in Scotland of eight, in Ireland of nine, in Australia of six, in New Zealand oif eleve.n.
Briefly summarised, the conclusions which may in my own opiinioin be drawn from the statistics set fo-rth in this paper are
i. Masculinity at birth is affected by race. 2. The effects of cross-breeding are doubtful. 3. Masculinity is generally higher in legitimate than in illegitiinma4te
births, but the piresent classificatilon of births as legitimate and illegitimate is useless from the physiological point of view. 4. Masculinity is greater in rural than in urban populations. 5. Masculinity is probably slightly greater in first than in subsequent births, but more evidence is needed on this point. 6. The Hofacker-Sadler.law is relegated to the limbo of the exploded theories. 7. So far a's the present evidence goe:s war raises the r,atio of masculinity.
