he English Speaking Commonwealth
SOME DEMOGRAPHIC FACTS

Tt HE POPULATIONS OF Australia, Canada and New Zealand, when taken together, amount to well over one-half
of the population of the United Kingdom. The English speaking part of the Commonwealth (if these territories may be so described) now consists, therefore, of more than eighty million persons, a number substantial enough to bear in mind as a major factor when considering Common Market aims and related problems.
Forty years ago, the three overseas territories
named above contained only a third as many people as the home country. The details of their rise in population to nearly two-thirds of that of the United Kingdom may be seen from the following table:

The mean expectation of life at birth is close to seventy for all four countries, and the difference in the crude death rates (and also to a small extent in the crude birth rates) are attributable to disparities in age-distribution, as may be seen from the following figures:

While, therefore, the home numbers have increased by only one-fifth, there has been a
doubling overseas.
The respective average rates of growth have thus been about one-half per cent and a little under 2 per cent per annum during the last four decades. At the present time the corresponding rates are 0 4 and 2-5 per cent respectively.

The area of Australia, Canada and New Zealand taken together is about seventy times as great as that of the United Kingdom and the average population density is 100 times lower. Even so, many of the people of the overseas territories live in urban areas of high density, and their marriage, divorce and fertility experi-
ence is similar to that of the United Kingdom.
