We may now proceed to the computation of pregnancy rates in our hypothetical population, again assuming no permanently sterile couples.

of months of exposure* experienced by 100 couples during successive time intervals after contraception has been discontinued. For the first month the number equals 100 by definition.
During the second month after discontinuation only sixty-six couple-months appear because thirty-four wives have already conceived in the first month and are not any longer exposed to
the risk of pregnancy. For the same reason, only forty-eight couple-months of exposure are experienced by 100 couples during the third
month, ninety-four during the second trimester, 108 during the second half year, and only
ninety-seven couple-months during the second full year.
The total number of couple-months of exposure corresponding to the 100 pregnancies of the 100 couples in the hypothetical population is 700. The average exposure or number of months required for conception in our model is exactly seven. We shall return to this figure later on.
The distribution of pregnancies by time

* Couple-months of exposure were computed by multiplying the numbers of conceptions per 100 couples during
the time interval (Table 3) by the reciprocals for the probability of conception for each component group, e.g., for the interval 4-6 months:
Group A 6-57 x 2 = 13-14 Group B 7-52 x 10 = 75.20
Group C *06 x 100 = 946..3040

intervals, in the second column, is the one
developed in the preceding table. Pregnancy
rates per couple-month of exposure appear in the third column and are finally converted into the more conventional rates per 100 couple-years.
During the first month after the stopping of
birth control the pregnancy rate of the hypothet-
ical population reaches the extremely high values of *338 per couple-month or 406 per 100 couple-years. Subsequently, as we had
concluded in our study in 1950, "the chance of conception declines steadily and rather rapidly"
until a pregnancy rate of 98 per 100 coupleyears prevails during the second year and a rate of only thirty thereafter.
In mathematical terms, the pregnancy rate of the hypothetical population during the first month of exposure is the arithmetic mean of the probabilities of conception assumed for the three component groups of couples. The pregnancy rate for the total period of exposure, until all couples have achieved pregnancy, is the harmonic mean of the component probabilities.
It is now necessary to introduce the factor of permanent sterility into the hypothetical population. For purposes of illustration it was assumed that 5 per cent of the couples discontinuing contraception are unable to achieve pregnancy at any time. The effect ofthis assumption which would seem to be more applicable to women in their late twenties or early thirties than to younger women3 is illustrated in Table 5.

has recommended in a recent publication8 statistical procedures designed to minimize the reduction of fecundity resulting from the early or late starting of contraceptive practice. Setting up criteria for the inclusion of couples in studies of the effectiveness of contraceptive methods, the Committee recommends that "at the time of prescription, the interval since the most recent pregnancy should not exceed six months without contraception or five years with contraception" and further that periods of "post-partum amenorrhea should . . . be
omitted" from the computation of pregnancy rates. Application of these rules would result in an approximation of the maximum pregnancy potential, especially if the average period of use of contraception is sufficiently long. The Committee recommends that it should be at
least one year.
