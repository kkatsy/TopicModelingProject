tions and references to such reports and existing statutes as bear upon

the different clauses will probably be found of use by official and other.

persons concerned with the mentally defective. In our opinion it is

marred by the introduction, which not only reveals a curiously medieval

state of mind in regard to scientific and social progress, decidedly out

of place in a lawyer, but which also suggests that Mr. Leach's practical

experiences of aments is somewhat limited. As an example we may

quote his statement that " the greater misery to mental defectives is to be

under detention in an institution away from their homes." We wonder

how many superintendents of institutions would endorse this view. Again

he says, " if there be any hurt in the Bill, the labouring classes are the

classes that would be hurt most." He is evidently unaware of the almost

daily requests made by members of the labouring class to have their

unfortunate children admitted into homes which do not now exist, and

most people who know will consider that the labouring class is not going

to be hurt, but to be helped most.

(I.) Is a reprint of Professor Pearson's address delivered at the York

Congress of the Royal Sanitary Institute this summer. Attention is

directed to the necessity of caution in interpreting the evidence relied

upon by medical officers of health; some instances of defective reasoning

are examined, and one or two aspects of infant mortality are discusse.

Professor Pearson, in the course of a criticism of the paper by Dr. R.

J. Ewart, recently published in this review, uses the phrase, " I cite from

the statement of a medical officer of health published by the London

Eugenics Education Society, a society which professes to help forward

the cause of Eugenics " (p. 13). It is perhaps desirable to remark that,

although the publication of a paper in this review indicates that the

editorial committee believe the paper to contain matter of interest to

students of eugenics, no responsibility is or can be assumed by the council

of the society for the correctness of the conclusions expressed or the

validity of the data used.

(2.) Contains the substance of a lecture delivered at the Galton Labora-

tory in M\Iarch, and once more emphasises the difficulty of interpreting

the semi-official statistics which are now accumulating at a rapid rate

and are generally thought to prove the all-sufficiency of environmental

reforms in ameliorating racial and social defects.
