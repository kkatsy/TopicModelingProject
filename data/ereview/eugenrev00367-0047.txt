The suit must in all cases be made at latest three years after the

marriage.

Section 46, 3. " Divorce. A marriage can be annulled on the suit of

one of the consorts, when the other consort at the date of the marriage

was suffering from venereal disease in an infectious stage, epilepsy with

frequent fits or leprosy or some incurable bodily defect disqualifying from

marriage."'

Section 62. "Divorce may be granted when one of the consorts,

knowing or even suspecting that he or she is suffering from infectious

venereal disease, has exposed by copulation the other consort to the risk of

infection, unless the other consort, being aware of the risk, incurred it

voluntarily. The suit must be claimed before six months have gone by

since the consort got the knowledge that he has been exposed to infection

and if the said consort has not been infected the suit cannot be claimed

after the disease has ceased to be infectious."
