DIFFERENTIAL FERTILITY IN 1951

By C. 0. CARTER, B.A., B.M., M.R.C.P.

P ROBABLY the best index of fertility is average family size. This takes no
account of those who do not marry, but
is less sensitive than the net reproduction rate to changes in marriage age and to temporary postponement of child-bearing. The Royal Commission on Population quoted the results of the I946 family census to show that differential fertility by social class was decreasing. Their distinction was, however, only between non-manual and manual workers. The publication of Part II of the One Per Cent Sample Tables* from the I95I Census provides some new and more
elaborate data. Here married women are separated into the Registrar-General's five social classes and also into more detailed socio-economic groups. The average fertility of women, married once only and under 50, may be calculated from the figures given for each group according both to duration of marriage and age at marriage.
The limitation to women under 50 is to be regretted. It has the effect that the women

who have been married for long durations are only represented by those among them
who married young. For example, only
women who married at less than 25 years of age will be recorded in the group married for
25 years or more. The tables therefore do
not provide complete information on average completed fertility. This limitation is not as serious as it appears at first, because the best guide to present trends is given by groups more recently married, particularly those who had most of their children since the end of the I939-45 war. For example only
women marrying at more than 40 years of age, and not all of these, will be absent from the 7 to 9 years duration of marriage group. The table shown below, derived from Table X8 of the One Per Cent Sample Tables shows the average fertility of women married from 7 to 9 years, subdivided by socio-economic group and age at marriage.
The figures for marriage duration 5-6 and
IO-I4 years show the same trends, except that the greater fertility of women married to men in the higher administrative, pro-

would be valuable is a classification of the families in each group by family size. It is
perhaps a matter of common experience that there are very few large families indeed among the non-manual workers, an occasional Roman Catholic family providing the
rare exception, that group 3 wives have a

higher proportion of 3 and 4 child families than other non-manual worker groups, and that large "' natural " families though still
occurring in the two bottom groups, are rapidly becoming less frequent. But it is most desirable that these impressions should be tested on a national scale.
