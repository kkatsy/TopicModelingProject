The corresponding data for England and Wales as a whole bear a general resemblance to those in the Table for the Mediterranean area. It is noteworthy, however, that women from this area more often work in a semi-skilled manual capacity than British women, while the reverse is true as regards men. Other prominent features in the Table are the high proportion of persons in category A, except for those born in the Caribbean area, and the unusually large concentrations of Indians and Africans in category B-probably mostly clerical occupations, whereas those from the West Indies have taken more to semi-skilled manual work. It will be appreciated that these are wide categories and that the data can be only broadly indicative, when differences in sex and age-

clerical workers among Indians and Africans, who also are strongly represented in the professional and technical classes. Persons from
the Mediterranean area are highly concentrated in the clothing industry and in service (i.e.
waiters)-one-half of them figure in these two groups. Those born in the Caribbean area are most widely distributed among the occupations of all the immigrants-in this respect at least they are thus the best assimilated-but there are
two occupation groups in which no appreciable numbers of immigrants are to be found-
farming and mining. It is a pity that no information on fertility is
included in this volume. There are some useful tables showing household composition, but these cannot throw any proper light on fertility.
