PHYSIQUE AND CHOICE OF CAREER*

With this in mind, it may not seem par-

players had volunteered in deficient or
excessive numbers for our study. The statistical result was clear-cut ; the gamesplayers and non-games-players turned up in equal proportions; games-playing was quite
unrelated to volunteering. The second college could not be studied in this way, but as no significant differences in physique occurred between the two colleges, the presumption is that no bias of this sort occurred there either. So that in all probability these I71 students do constitute a relatively unbiased sample of Oxford University students.
Methods. AU three groups had their physique assessed in precisely the same way. Some dozen anthropometric measurements were taken, in every case by the same anthropometrist, Mr. R. H. Whitehouse. Photogrammetric photographs were taken,t and the pictures somatotyped by the usual anthroposcopic procedure plus the use of

(a) Physical measurements. A full account of the -physical measurements will be published elsewhere; suffice it to say that there are no significant differences in height
between the three groups, but that the Oxford students weigh slightly less than the other two groups, particularly when the effect of age is allowed for. (The mean ages
are i8-5 for the cadets, 221I for the medical students and 2IP0 for the Oxford students,
but the range was greater for the medical and Oxford groups, and a small significant increase of weight with age was apparent in the Oxford, but not in the medical students. This small age difference is practically without effect on the other physical measurements and entirely without effect on the somatotypes). There is very little difference between the three groups in gross body size, as estimated- by surface area. The officer

Somatotype distribution of 283 Oxford Uni'versity students. (From Tanner, 1953a.)

* In the somatotype classification of body build
there are three components, each rated I to 7 on a series of criteria. Everybody has some of each component; there are no " types." The components
are negatively intercorrelated so that people designated by the three ratings 262 and 253 exist, but not people such as I I I, 777 or 266. The first component,
called endomorphy, has as its extreme the 711, who is as near spherical as is humanly possible; he has a round
head, a large fat abdomen predominating over his thorax, weak, floppy, penguin-like arms and legs,
antero-posterior diameters of the body which are relatively greater than those of the other extremes, and usually much subcutaneous fat. The second component, called mesomorphy, has as its I7I extreme the classical Hercules, with bone and muscle predominating, a cubical massive head, broad shoulders and chest, heavily muscled arms and legs and low antero-posterior body diameters. The third component, called ectomorphy, has as its II 7 extreme the totally linear man, with a thin peaked face with receding chin and high forehead, a narrow body, spindly arms and legs, and a large skin and nervous system area relative
to his size.

between the other two groups in mesomorphy; in endomorphy they are lowest.
Both student groups exceed the officer
cadets in ectomorphy, but do not differ between themselves. The somatotype distributions of the cadets and of a somewhat larger group of Oxford students (obtained
under the same circumstances as the I7I) are given in Figures i and 2, and in Figure 3 both the cadets and the I7I Oxford students are plotted simultaneously. The three components are plotted on triangular graph paper: the preponderance of those high in mesomorphy (at the peak of the triangle)
amongst the cadets can be seen by looking at the dotted distributions, and is demon-
strated in Figure 3 by the numbers given outside each sector of the triangle.

152 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

Other Authors' Results
There are thus very distinct differences between those who choose a career as Army officers, as doctors or as ex-graduates of Oxford University. Before discussing the reason for these differences, let me draw to your attention various other studies on the same subject, all of which, happily, show a very fair measure of agreement.
Perhaps the most striking of these, and the only one generally available (which Hooton I948, is not) dealing with normal adults is Garn and Gertler's (I950). In the course of work on the relation of physique and coronary heart disease, Garn and
Gertler had occasion to measure and somatotype a sample of ioo healthy men employed in a general factory plant. Of these, twenty were actively concerned with research, either as scientific workers or as technical assistants, while the remaining eighty were in the general plant on various duties, excluding

executive and planning ones. Table 2 shows some of the measurements given in the original paper, comparing the two groups.

conclusion in detail. The two groups were
closely comparable in age and in ethnic origins, and seemed to differ only in that more college graduates were in the research group than in the remainder. Accordingly
Garn and Gertler measured also the executives of the factory, who were largely collegetrained; but found these were very closely .matched with the general plant physique and actually differed from the research group
slightly more, rather than less, than did the general plant group. So the difference, as in the case of medical students and army
officers, lies not so much in educational level, as in some deliberate choice of a preferred
type of 'work.
The other groups that have been studied
are criminals, delinquents and students.
Hooton (i 9), in an immense study of the morphology of some I7,000 prison and reformatory inmates, showed that significant differences in various measurements existed

between those convicted of different sorts of crime. Lacking any very workable classification of physique, his study was more of a high-altitude aerial survey than a, detailed map of the ground, but he did show, -for
example, that those persons who were in
both the shortest one-sixth and the heaviest, one-sixth of his population headed the list of crimes for rape and sex offences and assault but were lowest (of nine groups) in murder, whereas the converse extreme group of tall and slender criminals were first in murder and robbery, but lowest or next to lowest in burglary, assault and rape and other sex offences.
The study of juvenile delinquents by the Gluecks (1950) dealt with delinquents as opposed to non-delinquents only, but, with the advent of somatotyping, produced much more clear-cut and comprehensible results. Five hundred delinquent boys age eleven to eighteen were measured and somatotyped
