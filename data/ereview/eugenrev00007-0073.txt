Urban and Rural Fertility

SOME FACTS

THE "FACTS" IN question are the index figures (live births per annum per thousand women aged 10-49) quoted in the 1965 issue of the United Nations Demographic Yearbook. The figures are as follows; all of them relate to a recent period-within the last ten
years or so:

Urban

Rural

Central African Republic Dahomey Guinea South Africa: Asiatic
Coloured White
Panama USA Israel Japan New Zealand Austria Bulgaria Finland Hungary Norway Roumania Sweden
United Kingdom

139 205 166 102 140 84 113 41 87
50 80 53 54 58 39 53 40 50 65

146 229 205 62 221 96 153 61 151 56 137
84 71 66 59 70 56 47 65

Although drawn from a limited number of areas, these data amply illustrate the thesis that urban fertility is lower than rural. It also seems reasonable that the difference between town and country should be small in a developing country such as the Central African Republic; larger in (say) Bulgaria, where fertility has recently fallen considerably and where a temporary differential may have been set up because this change has taken place earlier in the urban areas than in the rural ones; and that the disparity should again
be smaller in a country of advanced development such as Sweden. Yet many questions remain unanswered by the figures. Why should the differential
be reversed in Sweden and among the Asiatic peoples of South Africa? Why should the difference between town and country be so wide as one-half of the urban rate in the USA, when it is so much smaller in Japan? And why should there be such a big disparity in the results between Norway and Sweden?
To investigate these questions with precision would require a close study of the demography of the countries in the table. A few general possibilities as to the factors

THE EUGENICS REVIEW
affecting the figures may however be mentioned, First, the chance that the data are unreliable must not be overlooked, especially in the developing countries. Secondly, the definition of urban and rural may vary, and even if it does not it necessarily has a different connotation according to a country's economy and state of general development. Thus, where most births take place in hospital, the siting of the hospitals of different qualities will be highly significant, as also will be any tendency to choose urban hospitals in preference to rural ones. Finally, there are the demographic factors affecting the figuresdifferences in the distribution of town and country populations by age and sex and proportion married.
In spite of these important qualifications, the data have been included in the Yearbook. They are certainly interesting and will no doubt serve as a stimulus to further research.
