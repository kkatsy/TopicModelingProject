Army Examinations and Heredity (continued).
By B. S. BRAMWELL.
It occurred to me that it would be of some interest to examine the war records of the various officers whose scholastic records were the subject of mv previous article. The school has published a record of its former pupils in the war, so a large body of material is available for investigation. The only question is how to treat it. It is impossible to make rank our standard of comparison; we have however a list of the various decorations, brevet-ranks and mentions in despatches. Can these be takeii for the purpose? Would they be fair as between sapper, gunner and infantryman? So far as the individual is concerned one knows that honours are fickle things and may depend very largely on the idiosyncrasies of Divisional Generals. Generals often have strong views about branches of the service other than their own. "I'm not going to have any more d ed artillery up here, " this from a Sapper General. "He'll go mad I tell you, all sappers are mad, " this from a gunner staff officer. "We wondered whether the Scientific branch e.ould help us," this with icy politeness from an Infantry Divisional Commander to a gunner colonel, a clever mathematician; the problem being a formula for the range of view from an aeroplane at various heights.
Some generals give few recommendations, others are lavish in their recommendations. This will not affect the fairness of our criterion very greatly, however, as each division is composite, so if the Commander is lavish or sparing, sapper, gunner and infantryman will fare alike. A more difficult question arises from the fact that most Divisional Commanders are infantrymen or cavalrymen and so might be expected to show a preference in the direction of the infantry. As against this might be set the fact that casualties amongst the infanry are more severe. It is obvious that men killed in their first action have little chance of earning rewards of the nature under consideration. So possibly some correction would have to be made for this before a fair comparison can be made between sapper, gunner and infantrymen. We are not concerned with preferment to the higher positions of command in the army. The age of the men under consideration forbids this. The oldest of them could only be 48 when the war started. As a matter of fact though many attained to the position of Brigadier-general only two obtained the rank of Major-general. The average age at the outbreak of war was about 34.
From our former totals we must deduct all those who did not take part in the war of 1914-18. This analysis is of some interest. It shows the number of deaths, a total of 10%, and how they were distributed; it also shows the numbers of those who had resigned or retired up to 1910. the date of the Register, and who did not come forward for service in 1914. It is therefore to some extent a record of the effectiveness of the various classes of officers. There is also a small percentage

of cases (2 %) about which I have no particulars. These officers did not
take part in the war and yet they are shewn as serving soldiers in the register in 1910. They probably died or resigned in the intervening period.

One is tempted to moralise on the fact that the percentage of deaths from disease is least in the sapper class and greatest in the militia class and to recall that athletic power as well as intellectual ability perhaps diminishes in this class but the volume of figures is too small to build up theories on it. One may notice the figures in passing for what they are worth and also that the figures for resignations and cases of which we have no particulars occur with least frequency in the sapper and with most in the Sandhurst and militia classes.
We are now in a postion to consider the statistics of the great war. In doing so we must first deduct all those shewn in the last table as not having taken part in it, and look solely at the balance. Certain officers have transferred from the original corps; I have treated these however under the original corps and not under their second choice. What we are considering, after all, is individuals and their intellectual

differences rather than soldiers. These cases are not very numerous, one of the commonest is for gunners to transfer to the Indian Army; such cases are here treated as gunners and not as Indian officers. As the opportunities of the Indian officers considered in bulk were less than those of other officers owing to the necessary retention of a large number of them in India, the gunner category would suffer to some extent by this treatment of our figures but as I have already mentioned our quest is the intellectual history and development of certain young men passing certain examinations when about the age of twenty. We had them classified then by army examiners; we had them classified at an earlier age by their schoolmasters; we are now going to have them classified by Generals and see if they are placed in anything like the

ARMY EXAMINATIONS AND HEREDITY.

same order of merit. As in our previous investigation but for entirely
different reasons (probably that just stated) the Indian officer class stands in an anomalous position and our main attention should be
directed to the other four classes, sappers, gunners, Sandhurst officers and Militia officers.
I now give the statistics relating to the Great War; in considering the figures of decorations, brevet promotions and mention in despatches
only those won in this war are included and no notice is taken of those awarded in previous camapigns.

We have now two standards of comparison namely, which class of officer got most honours and in which class were fewest officers honoured. I do not suppose that anyone will suggest that there was a conspiracy amongst those with the power to grant awards and mentions to favour one class of officer at the expense of another class although individual generals may have had prejudices; on the other hand army custom may be largely responsible for the very curious outcome of our investigation. For if it be granted that the position of the Indian officers was rather anonalous for purposes of comparison with other officers in the war and may therefore be neglected our remaining four classes fall into proper sequence for both the tests suggested, except in one single instance. I have mentioned that probably some correction should be made to correct for the unequal incidence of casualties. The totals I have given in the last table, of officers who did not receive a decoration, brevet promotion or mention did not include officers who became casualties. But such cases are of considerable number (6, 14, 22, 64, and 40 in the five classes). It is obvious that some of these officers can have had no opportunity of earning distinction, others on the other hand may not have become casualties until the final stages
of the war. What allowance should be made to meet these cir-
cumstances? It is rather difficult to determine exactly but the extreme views are either to make no allowance at all or to deduct all such cases from our tota 1 of officers serving in the war before considering

528 EUGENICS REVIEW.

percentages or rewards of officers who did not appear in the lists of decorations, etc. The correct allowance must lie between these extremes. If we take a mean result between our two extremes and deduct half the total of such cases from the total of officers who served
we shall not be very far wrong.

Leaving out of account the Indian officer class and noting the one instance where the figures deviate slightly from what might possibly have been expected, namely that gunner officers who did not become casualties and who did not receive recognition in despatches, etc., were slightly more numerous than similar Sandhurst officers, we have the result that the merits of officers are graded by Generals as they were graded by army examiners on the average 14 to 20 years previously, and as by schoolmasters some 4 or 5 years earlier still. Further that this grading is in accord with the intellectual grading of their brothers as determined by the Army examiners and by other methods and also with that of their fathers as estimated by the methods described in my previous article. The most obvious criticism which'occurs to me of this rather remarkable agreement of fact with eugenic theory, is that the Army is a conservative institution largely governed by tradition and precedent and that possibly it may be customary to make awards in accordance with a traditionary scale of ability. While there may be something in such an explanation, it hardly seems sufficient to cover the whole ground. If it is thought that little weight should be given to this or similar explanations and that the numbers of rewards, etc., are a fair indication of the military merits of the four classes, they are then also a testimonial to the efficacy of the Army examination svstem.
We can also compare the various grades in which boys were placed on entering school in the light of this new standard of rewards and mentions in the war. The reader may remember that in my previous article I made a classification of 654 boys into seven grades based on the class they joined on entering school and this class depends on the school entrance examination. I have traced the war record of 576 of these boys. It will be advisable to introduce a correction again for the case of those officers whose naines did not appear in despatches

and who became casualties. I propose to make as before an allowance by deducting 50 per cent. of such cases from my gross totals and then to compare my remainder with the number of rewards, brevet promotions and mentions won by each grade. In the subjoined table therefore the first column will show the whole 576 officers distributed in the seven grades. The second coluimn has a full deduction of all officers
who became casualties and who were unrewarded or unmentioned in
despatches. The third column has the 50 per cent. deduction. The fourth column shows the decorations, etc., won by each grade and the fifth column reduces column four to a percentage of column three.

Leaving out of account grade 7 where the numbers are too small
for a fair comparison, it will be noted that the first five grades fall into a regular order but that grade six breaks the series. I therefore
analysed the components of this grade more closely, More than 75%
of its components are Sandhurst and Militia officers. The Sandhurst officers are quite normal according to this test and fall into their theoretical place with a percentage below that in grade five which in turn is below that in grade four. The abnormality depends entirely therefore on the Militia officers who have a much higher percentage of rewards, etc., than the Militia officers in the two immediate higher grades. Four officers out of thirty-five Militia officers in this grade are responsiblefor no less than 38 out of 61 decorations, etc. On examining more fully the careers of these officers I found that two entered the school when when over fifteen and a half years of age and although 2 classes below the normal of their age at entry had reached a more normal position on leaving. It is not unlikely that they were handicapped at the start by their early education not having followed the ordinary channels. If we were at liberty to discount these two cases grade six would very nearly fall into line. The other two cases cannot be explained away on any such hypothesis. In each case the boy had failed to improve his position in the scholastic sense after a bad start. They each had brothers with a similar history. In each case the war record is magnificent, one of high courage and splendid tenacity. And yet at school neither had been of any athletic renown. There are other things besides intellectual and muscular power of importance in warfare. Subject to these exceptions the correspondence of the intellectual grade in early youth with performance as measured by Military
authorities in manhood is striking. I append tables of the ranks and decorations shewn in the war
record.
