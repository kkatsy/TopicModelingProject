THE PROBLEM OF THE SEX-RATIO.

By J. A. COBB.

There are several unsolved problems connected with the sex-ratio of

man, i.e., the ratio which the number of males bears to the total popula-

tion. Before discussing the problems I will set out the principal facts

known about the sex-ratio.

There are three sex-ratios which concern us-(i) the sex-ratio at con-

ception. This is important from a biological point of view. Its value can

only be roughly estimated, but it is decidedly high, the number of males conceived notably exceeding the females. (2) The sex-ratio at birth. By

this is meant the ratio of the number of boys born alive to all those born

alive. Of this sex-ratio accurate statistics are available. The chief source

of error seems to lie in the fact that in some countries infants who are

born alive but who die before registration are counted as still-born. As

such infants include a higher proportion of males than other infants their

enumeration would tend to slightly raise the birth sex-ratio in those countries. In all countries the sex-ratio at birth is somewhat over '5, in

England it is about '5o9. (3) The sex-ratio at the age of reproduction or
marriage. At this age there is a surplus of women. At all ages past

childhood there are more women than men owing to boys having a higher

death-rate than girls, and as men are usually older than the women they

marry, the proportion of marriageable men to marriageable women is

still further diminished.

Let us just consider the sex-ratio at birth. Although this sex-ratio is

fairly constant, it is subject to various fluctuations. It varies from one

country to another, rising from '509 in England to *513 in Germany," and

to still higher values in Spain and Servia. Moreover, it varies from one

part of a country to another, as is shown in the case of England by Yule2.

The sex-ratio also varies from year to year. It fell in England until

about I890, when it began to rise. In France it fell steadily all through

the nineteenth century. In other countries it has remained stationary or

has risen.

Apart from what may be called the secular variation of the sex-ratio there is a seasonal variation. This was observed by Dusing in the returns of the births in Prussia for the years I875-873. He noticed that in those months in which there were more children born per day there was a smaller proportion of males. His figures were:

Month of birth Jan. Feb Miar. Apl. May June July Aug. Sept. Oct. Nov. Dec. Births per day 3087 3153 3087 2962 2859 2787 2813 2937 3i69 3005 2989 2976

If one calculates the correlation between the sex-ratio and the number of births, it is found to, be -64, which would seem to show that the con-

nection between birth-rate and sex-ratio is not fortuitous.

In order to test the matter further I obtained, by the courtesy of the Registrar-General, the returns of the births of the sexes separately for

each quarter for the years I840-I9I0. This gave the following results:

Total births ... Births per day ... Sex-ratio ...

2111
*50999

4th quarter 13549494 2074
.5Io23

Although the sex-ratio varies very little from quarter to quarter the

differences are too great to be due to chance. The correlation between

the sex-ratio and the number of births per day is -85, a result which

agrees with that of Dusing.

The sex-ratio also varies with the size of the family. In Saxony for

the years I876-85 when a child's birth was registered, the number of his

brothers and sisters was given. From Geissler's work1 we get the follow-

ing table of the sex-ratios of these incomplete families:

Number of births, coo's omitted ... 504 429 346 265 I84 128 79 47 55

't is to be noted that these data are not independent, e.g., some of the families of eight are included in those of nine, while the first eight of some but not all of the families of nine are included in the families of eight.
From this table it appears that the sex-ratio remains about the same for families containing less than eight or nine children and rises rapidly in the larger families.
The question arises whether this excess of males in the larger families is due to later births being more often male than earlier ones, or is it due to the fact that larger families have an excess of males from the beginning. Geissler's data show that the second hypothesis is the correct one. For the 996,76I children whose births were registered were in the proportion of 5,149 males to io,ooo births, while if their sex-ratio had been the same as that of their elder.bro-thers and sisters the proportion would have been 5,I53 to Io,ooo. I may mention in this connection that I have
found in the case of families of mares taken from the General Stud Book that there were Io,i88 males in the first third part of the families and only 9,803 in the last third part. This discrepancy is greater than could be due to chance, and shows that in this case there is a tendency for fewer males to be born as the mares get older.
One is led, then, to the conclusion that there is some connection between fertility and excess of males. This is shown by the following table, which compares A, the sex-ratio of the first n members of all families with at least n members, with B, the sex-ratio of the first n members of families with more than n members:

The B row is almost always greater than the A row. This shows that when n children have already been born those families which have a larger proportion of males are more likely than the others to further increase in numbers.
This excess of males in the larger families may be attributed to the fact that still-births and abortive births, while they reduce the size of the family, also reduce the proportion of males in it, for prenatal deaths show a higher sex-ratio than the sex-ratio at birth. Consequently the larger families in which the proportion of abortive births is small contain a larger proportion of males.
When all these fluctuations have been eliminated there still remains a considerable variation in the sex-ratio of families of the same race and period and of the same size. If the sex-ratio were the same in all the

53,680 families of eight given by Geissler, it is easy to calculate how many families would have eight boys, how many seven boys and one girl, and other combinations.

There are more cases of a great excess of boys or of girls than would
be expected if the sex-ratio were the same for all families. In fact the observed figures are such as might be expected if the sex-ratios of the various families differed amongst each other to such an extent the square root of mean square of deviation from the mean amounted to '033. This is easily calculated, for if -' is the mean square of the calculated

deviation and o- that of the observed deviation, the standard deviation

of the sex-ratio is cq;9_n

The mean sex-ratio of all families of eight was '55, and one may
draw from the table the conclusion that about one-half the families have

a sex-ratio between '536 and '494, while the remaining families have a

sex-ratio outside those limits.

The standard deviation of the sex-ratio of all the families appears

in the following table:

It may at first sight appear strange that a boy should have more

brothers than a girl, it might seem that if one boy is taken from a family

it would make the proportion of boys to girls left less than if a girl

is taken from it. But it must be remembered that one starts by selecting

a family in which there is at least one boy and that the greater number

of boys there are in the family the greater is its chance of being selected.

A girl, on the other hand, is more likely tog be taken from a family con-

taining more girls. If all families had the same sex-ratio a boy would

have brothers and sisters in the same proportion as a girl. It would be

analagous to the result of tossing eight coins a large number of times.

The fact that in one batch of eight a coin taken at random proved to be

a head would not affect the probable proportion of heads and tails in the

remainder of the batch. If, on the other hand, there were several sets of

coins, some of which were constructed to give a bias towards heads and

others towards tails, the fact that a particular coin chosen at random in a

batch proved to be a head would make it more probable that the batch had

a bias towards heads, and consequently it would increase the probability

of the others in the batch being heads. This latter case is analogous

with that of the variable sex-ratio that we find.

The matter can be treated in another way. The numbers of pairs

of brothers, of sisters, and of brother and sister can be used to form a

four-fold table," thus:

Brothers.

Sisters.

Brothers ... ... 800000 ... 747I6I

Sisters ... ...

747I6I ... 711758

From this the coefficient of association and the correlation between

members of the same family in respect to sex can be calculated. The

former is 'oogg and the latter oo49.

If a boy and a girl are taken at random from amongst all the families

of all sizes in Geissler's data it is found that the boy has more brothers

and sisters than the girl. The boy has 2-753 brothers and 2 556 sisters,

5'309 in all, while a girl has 2'7I2 brothers and 2-579 sisters, 5'29I in all.

This is due to the fact that there is a larger proportion of males in the

We must now enquire into the cause of this variability of the sex-

ratio.

It is no doubt partly due to the occurrence of twins. Twins have a

tendency to be of the same sex, and, consequently, a boy who is a twin is

likely to have more brothers than a girl who is a twin. This factor is

not important enough to account for more than a small portion of the

variability of the sex-ratio. This subject is difficult to deal with. For

there is a larger proportion of twins in the larger families, but adequate

statistics are not available. Another cause of the variability is the

occurrence of abortive births, which affect the sex-ratio to an unequal

degree in different families. This again will only account for a small

part of the actual variability.

One is therefore led to the conclusion that there is some other cause

of the variations. It naturally occurs to one that it may be an innate

variation subject to the laws of heredity. The only sex-ratio, the heredity

of which has been investigated, is the sex-ratio at birth, and the question

whether this is inherited has not been settled with any certainty. In

other words, it is not recognised that a person who is born of a family

in which one sex is unusually numerous would himself be more likely to

have children of that sex. The correlation between father and son for

most qualities that can be accurately measured is about ;, but for the

sex-ratio the correlation has been shown to be much less than that. This

might have been anticipated. For the correlation between father's sex-

ratio and child's sex-ratio is more comparable to that between uncle and nephew as respects personal qualities, and this is smaller than that between father and son. Moreover-and this is the important point-the sex-ratio cannot be estimated with certainty unless the family is infinitely large, the square of the standard deviation of such an estimate being about I So the observed correlation must be multiplied by approximately

/ 4 to give the true value of the correlation.

A correlation between the sex-ratios of parent and offspring has been found by those who have investigated the matter,, but the investigators, having found a low correlation and not seeing that a low correlation was to be expected, assumed that such correlation as was found was not significant, but was merely due to insufficient data. They, therefore, rashly
came to the conclusion that the sex-ratio was not inherited.
But even if the sex-ratio at birth were proved to be inherited it would not necessarily follow that the sex-ratio at conception is subject to the laws of heredity, for there might be heritable factors such as anti-natal mortality which would affect one sex-ratio and not the other. We are therefore reduced to general reasoning as to the inheritance of the conception sex-ratio, and there seems to be strong grounds for believing that it is subject to the laws of heredity. In fact, it seems strange that it should not have been taken for granted. All other qualities of human beings are assumed to be inherited unless they come under the heading of acquired faculties, when their inheritance is strongly disputed. Sex is certainly not an acquired faculty, and so the burden of proof seems rather to lie on those who deny that it is inherited. If the sex-ratio were not variable, or if the variations were not inherited, it is difficult to see how in the course of evolution the sex-ratio has changed.
It is at any rate worth while to trace the result of assuming that the
sex-ratio is inherited. If we take the sex-ratio at birth it appears at first sight that the
numbers of the sexes born will become equal. For if there are more born of one sex, say, the male, a female will have a greater chance of finding a mate than a male. There will be more matings, therefore, among the descendants of mothers of females than amongst the descendant of mothers of males. The mothers of females will therefore be better represented in the third generation, and as their characteristic is assumed to
be inherited, there will be a tendency for the sex-ratio to diminish until it reaches equality in numbers between the sexes at birth. The same argument will show a tendency towards equality between the numbers of the sexes at the time of conception and at the age of marriage.
The numerical equality of the sexes may therefore be accounted for in a general way on the ground of heredity, not as has been often said,
because as between race and race that race would survive in which the
sexes were nearest equality, but because, as I maintain, within the race those individuals who tend to reduce the inequality of the sex-ratio will
have more descendants. This is in accordance with the general trend of
evolution. The qualities that have survived are chiefly those that have helped the individual possessing them and his offspring rather than those
which were more useful to the race than to their owner. In the above argument as to the tendency of the sexes towards an
equality of numbers the effect of the fact that the young of the male sex have a higher death-rate than those of the female has been neglected. A
consideration of it will account for the higher sex-ratio at conception and
at birth, and for the lower sex-ratio, at the age of marriage. If we Biometrika, vol. v., pp. 73, 79, and 436.; vol. vi., pp. IO9 and 120.

I62 EUGENICS REVIEW. assume that males and females are conceived in equal numbers, a male at conception will have the same chance as a female of eventually finding a mate. Now if males have a higher death-rate when young the chance of mating of any male taken at random from amongst all males conceived will not be diminished. For if one male dies his chance will vanish, but the chance of the remaining males will be correspondingly increased.
If, however, the amount of food for the family is limited a mother of boys will be able to provide for them more easily for a larger proportion of them will die early and will therefore not require so much food. This will tend to give an advantage to the brother or sister of boys over the brother or sister of girls. A brother or sister of boys will be less likely to be starved and more likely to grow to maturity and to marry. He or she will have a tendency to produce more males than a brother or sister of girls. The sex-ratio will therefore rise until the less expenditure attendant upon the birth of a boy is balanced by the smaller chance a boy will have of finding a mate.
The differential death-rate has an effect on the sex-ratio, at the age of
marriage opposite to that which it has on the sex-ratio at conception and
at birth. For a male costs more than a female to rear to adolescence, since each adult male is the survivor of a larger number of male children than a female is of female children. So the male adults costing the mother more, will become less numerous at the age of adolescence. Let us examine the matter more closely. Suppose that the conception sexratio and the differential death-rate so adjusted as to allow the numbers at the age of marriage to be equal. Then if the male adult costs the parent
more than the female, those parents who have less than the average proportion of sons will rear more children to the age of marriage than the others. So under these circumstances a boy or girl will have a greater chance of growing to adolescence the lower the sex-ratio of his parents.
This will therefore lower the sex-ratio at conception until the number of women at the age of marriage is greater than that of the men, but will
not lower it beyond the point where the excess of women, due to the cost of their rearing being less than of men, is checked by their smaller prospect of finding a mate.
We have now shown how the differential death-rate raises the sexratio at conception and lowers that at marriage. The sex-ratio at birth will be intermediate between the other two, for it can be easily shown to be lower than the conception-ratio, and higher than the marriage-ratio.
It may be objected that at present starvation is not common enough to play an important part in the matter. That may be so, but one has not to go back many generations before one finds that in the bulk of the population starvation was practically the only check to its increase. The sex-ratio was established by the condition of affairs existing then. One would not expect heredity to alter the sex-ratio quickly.
There is another point to be discussed. The fact that a man is generally a year or two older than his wife might seem to, have some influence on the sex-ratio and it seems to have been thought by Sadler and others that the preponderance of male births was due to this circumstance. Investigation showed, however, that the relative ages of husband and wife did not affect the sex-ratio of the offspring. If when the population is increasing a man selects his wife from those born two years later than himself, it gives him a larger number from whom to choose than if he
took his wife from those born the same year as himself, for the number of births of girls increases from year to year. This, then, increases the man's chance of marrying and diminishes the woman's. But this biological advantage to the man is precisely balanced by the fact that the time between the birth of father and son is longer than that between mother and son. So the population does not increase so rapidly on the
male side as on the female. The fact that a man marries later on the

I63

average does not therefore affect the probable number of the descendants of any male taken at random at the time of conception.
The foregoing analysis of the causes which brought the sex-ratios to their present values should form a basis for forecasting the proportion of the sexes in the future. The question as to the future proportion of the sexes at the age of marriage is the most important and the easiest to answer. A diminution of the death-rate in childhood may be anticipated, and as this death-rate is higher in the case of the male sex, the result in the near future will probably be a considerable increase in the proportion of men to women at the age of marriage until eventually the two sexes become about equal in number. This same cause will also probably eventually lower the sex-ratio at conception and at birth.
The above remarks are merely made to show some of the factors which will have to be considered before the problem of the sex-ratio is solved.
