Demographic Rivalry Between U.S.A. and U.S.S.R.

SOME FACTS

I NTERNATIONAL ARGUMENT IS no new
thing, but it is perhaps unprecedented for a dispute to arise as to which of two countries

what has been happening recently. Myers, the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration in Washington, stated publicly in 1959 that

mortality in the U.S.S.R. in recent years had been significantly higher than in the U.S., and

conversely that Russian fertility had been lower. Professor Merkov, of the Institute of Health Protection and History of Medicine in Moscow,

retorted that "correctly conducted demographic analysis serves to confirm that . . . birth and fertility rates are higher in U.S.S.R., and mor-

tality lower, than in the U.S.A." Professor as the weighting system, then Russian mortality

Merkov went on to imply that, as the United appears to be 3 per cent higher overall, but if

States had the most favourable experience, in these respects, of any country in the capitalist world, this showed that prosperity must be higher in the U.S.S.R. than in the West generally.
Myers has now supplied a new analysis in which he sets out the death rates in Russia in the year 1958 in quinary age groups, as quoted by Pravda, alongside the corresponding figures for America.* This comparison shows that, on the available figures, Russian mortality is the higher of the two at all ages up to forty-five, and the lower of the two after age fifty.
Once we are aware of the extent and direction
of mortality differences at various age-points, it becomes of only limited significance to attempt to express the whole in a single average index ratio. If one does so, however, the result will depend on the method of weighting used. Myers now shows that if the Russian population is used

the United States population is adopted for this purpose then American mortality appears to be 3 per cent higher overall. Neither of these average disparities is particularly meaningful. It would be more useful if valid and comparable analyses by cause of death could be made, as these might throw some light on the real medical and social differences between the two countries and how mortality rates could be further reduced
in each one. In regard to fertility it is not possible to enter
into so much statistical detail because of the absence of Russian data, and analysis is more complicated because of the element of marital status. Myers reaffirms that, although the crude birth rates in the two countries are closely similar, an intrinsically higher fertility in the U.S.A. is offset by an older age-distribution. Until more details are available, this must remain

the most likely account of the situation.
