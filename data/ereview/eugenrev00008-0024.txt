Legal Abortion in Eastern
Europe
The Laws
Therapeutic abortion on medical and certain social grounds has been legal in all the countries of eastern Europe for a decade or more. The USSR was the first European country to revise its abortion laws and, under the decree of 8th November 1920, abortion at the request of the pregnant woman was legalized. In 1936 the operation was restricted to medical and eugenic grounds but this law was repealed by a further decree of 23rd November 1955.9 In the rest of prewar eastern Europe abortion was illegal (except for cases of rape under the Polish Penal Code of 1932). As is often the case, strict anti-abortion laws proved difficult to enforce: for example, 1,843 abortions (spontaneous and criminal) were admitted to the Warsaw Municipal Hospitals in 1924 but only fifty-two cases of prosecution for
criminal abortion were instituted and twenty-eight of those accused were acquitted.4'
Following World War II life in eastern Europe was very hard and in many areas law and order broke down. Rape was common and abortion widely used for this and other humanitarian reasons. In some countries the majority of the doctors had been killed and it was the midwives and lay people who did the abortions but under the conditions prevailing few prosecutions were made. In 1947 the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) legislated to permit abortion for a range of medical and social indications; three years later the operation was limited to medical and eugenic considerations but in March 1965 the law was extended again so that the woman's environment was considered. Particular attention was given to women over forty or under sixteen and to women with five or more children or those who had had several pregnancies close together.
Termination on strictly medical grounds was legalized in Yugoslavia in 1951 and in Czechoslovakia one year later, and abortion on medical and social grounds was introduced into Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and Rumania in 1956, into Czechoslovakia in 1957 and Yugoslavia in 1960.
The preamble to the Polish law of 27th April 1956 summarizes the aim behind the new laws: "On the conditions under which an abortion is allowed in order to protect the health of the woman against the ill effects of abortion done in bad conditions and not by a doctor". 3 The Czech law used almost the same wording and the Soviet law goes further, speaking of giving "women the possibility of deciding for themselves the question of motherhood". The law is orientated towards the woman and in most eastern European countries it is possible for a termination to take place without consent of the husband, although in practice this rarely happens.
The key legal clause in the Czechoslovakian law (19th December 1957, Paragraph 3, subsection 2) is brief: "Permission for termination of pregnancy may be granted on medical grounds or other reasons deserving special consideration".3 However this loosely worded act is supplemented by more detailed decrees. Under the decree of 21st December 1962 the "other reasons" are set out and include, "advanced age of the woman, at least three live children, invalidism or loss of husband, disruption of family, threat to living standard in instances where the economic upkeep of the family or children depends mainly on the
232

woman, difficult position which arises in unmarried women by pregnancy and circumstances which suggest that pregnancy resulted after rape or an unlawful act". The medical and obstetric indications for termination are also catalogued at great length. Requests for an abortion have to go through a local Commission consisting of one gynaecologist and two lay people. A woman has the right of appeal to a regional Commission.
As in Czechoslovakia, the Polish law appears to be intentionally vague and the Minister of Health and Social Security is empowered to make more detailed recommendations. The Act (27th April 1956) permits termination when "medical indications favour it", in the case of "difficult conditions of life of the pregnant woman" and when there is a "justified supposition that the pregnancy arose by a criminal act", a single doctor can sign the certificate permitting an abortion. The consent of the parent or guardian must be obtained for a girl under eighteen.13 The Minister (Order 19th December 1959) has specified that the "difficult conditions of life" should be recorded and signed by the woman and he has made it obligatory that the pregnant woman should be given contraceptive advice. The operation must be registered and when taking place outside a State Institution must be recorded in some detail. A woman refused a termination by a doctor has a right of appeal to a Municipal Medical Commission.
The Yugoslavian law permits abortion when the birth of a child "would result in a serious personal, familial or economic situation for the pregnant woman which cannot be averted in any other way". Abortions are considered by a Commission consisting of two doctors and a social worker. It is specified that the Commission must point out the dangers of abortion and the advantages of contraception. It is officially stated that "A health worker should regard abortion as biologically, medically, psychologically, and socially harmful. Corresponding to the principles of socialist humanism and medical knowledge, human life must be respected from its beginning"..1I
The law differs in Hungary and Rumania from that in other eastern European countries in that, besides specifying medical, eugenic and social reasons, abortion must also be granted "if the applicant insists on the interruption of pregnancy."16 Both nations possess abortion commissions. In Hungary they consist of a medical chairman, a representative of local government and a member of the local women's association. The woman must pay for the operation when it is done for social reasons.
Most eastern European countries have altered their laws on abortion on one or more occasions. On the one hand there has been a tendency to extend laws, which initially were limited to medical circumstances, to include the social conditions of the mother. In addition, the Poles (1961) have widened their law by abolishing a requirement that the woman's social circumstances should be reviewed by an independent observer. On the other hand, in those countries where the law has allowed absolute freedom of choice there has been a movement to restrict the operation. The Commissions in Hungary have been empowered to delay the operation so the woman may think over the problem, but the final choice still rests with the mother. The Rumanian Council of State (1967)29 has limited abortion to cases where the pregnancy endangers life, where there is a risk of congenital deformity, after rape, in women who are over forty-five or who have had four or more children and to cases where the woman is "physically, psychologically or emotionally incapacitated". Even in its amended form the Rumanian law is more liberal than that of any western European nation.
In all countries there are certain limits on when a termination can be performed. Except in cases where there is grave danger to life, or where serious eugenic reasons exist, the operation is restricted to the first three months of pregnancy. Sometimes there is a regulation forbidding a repeat abortion unless a specified interval (usually six months) has elapsed since the last operation. In Czechoslovkia this regulation is enforced, in Poland it
233

THE EUGENICS REVIEW
seems easy to avoid the rule. Abortion is not permitted in cases of pelvic disease. Often parental permission is required in the case of girls under eighteen, but no distinction is made between the married and unmarried.
Illegal abortion is always a punishable offence. In Poland assisting a woman in an illegal operation is subject to a maximum of three years' imprisonment and forcing a woman to have an abortion against her will carries a five-year penal sentence. In Czechoslovakia the sentence is one to five years and a distinction is also made if the operation impairs the woman's health. A woman inducing her own abortion is specifically immune from legal punishment in Czechoslovakia and Poland.

The Operation
Dilatation and curettage is the commonest method of abortion in eastern Europe. Vacuum aspiration is used widely in Russia, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia and on a small scale in most other countries. It is usually held to be superior to curettage but surgeons well practised in the latter technique find it simple and effective and are often reluctant to adopt a new method. The literature dealing with the clinical aspects of vacuum aspiration has been reviewed by Kerslake and Casey.15
Inhalation or intravenous anaesthetics are used. Short-acting anaesthetics such as thiopentone are sufficient to cover either curettage or vacuum aspiration when done in the
early months of pregnancy. Local paracervical anaesthesia is used in certain centres and it is particularly effective when combined with atropine.
The length of hospital stay varies greatly and is more dependent on social factors than on strictly medical considerations. In Rumania and parts of Yugoslavia the woman goes home two hours after the operation. In Hungary it is illegal to do the operation as an outpatient but many women are discharged after two days in hospital. In Czechoslovakia the hospital stay is extended to three to four days and up to six if possible. One clinic in Prague with twenty-eight beds devoted to abortions interrupted 1,800 pregnancies in 1965 and with ninety-six obstetric beds cared fol 2,184 deliveries. The same clinic devotes 116 beds
to gynaecological cases. Since the alteration of the abortion law, women have been seeking terminations at
increasingly early stages in pregnancy coming on average at ten weeks in Czechoslovakia
and eight weeks in Hungary. In eastern Europe deaths from legal terminations are rare. When the operation is
confined to the first three months of pregnancy the death rate is usually less than one in 10,000. Statistical handling of rare events is difficult and in Table 1 the absolute figures for legal abortions and associated deaths are given. A proportion of the deaths which occur

are among women who are being aborted for medical reasons and who would be terminated in most countries. For instance, of the fifteen deaths in Hungary in 1957-58, one was in a patient with Addison's disease, one with uraemia and one in cardiac failure. For comparison in 1961 there were eighty-seven deaths among "incomplete abortions" many of which must have been the result of illegal operations. Legal abortion is many times safer than leaving the woman the risk of obtaining a criminal abortion and in the early months is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term.
Immediate complications of legal abortion have been brought to a low level. The official Czech figures for 1959 are 0-6 per cent infected, 0-1 per cent perforation or severe trauma and 0-2 per cent haemorrhage.5 39 The comparable figures for the "spontaneous abortions" are 1 0 per cent for infection and 0 3 per cent for haemorrhage. It might seem that the criteria for the registration of cases are set rather high; however, the figures for Hungary in 1964 are similar, 0 3 per cent for perforation, 0 37 per cent for infection and 0-62 per cent for haemorrhage.16 Perhaps the most objective indicator is the number of women readmitted to hospital within four weeks of a legal termination and in Hungary the percentage is 0-47 for infection and 1 02 for haemorrhage.16 With the wider use of the vacuum technique the complication rates may fall even lower. From the large series of statistics available for Czechoslovakia it is possible to comment upon some of the long term side effects of termination. There appears to be a positive correlation between previous abortion and placenta praevia, abruptic placenta, cervical incompetence and prolonged labour. In no case are the risks great but there has been a doubling of the perinatal mortality rate in Hungary. The prematurity rate (live births under 2,500 gm.) is 11-12 per cent 16 overall and rises to 15 per cent in the towns and there seems little doubt that there is a true relationship between the high incidence of therapeutic abortion and prematurity. The intetruption of pregnancy in the young (under seventeen) is more dangerous than in other cases. The ill consequences of abortion have been followed closely in Czechoslovakia and as reliable information is obtained an effort is made to avoid aborting those groups most at risk.
No relationship has been found between ectopic pregnancy and previous abortion. The large size of the series available for study makes the clinical experience of eastern European doctors some of the most reliable that is available. The Japanese are the only other nation with comparable material and their findings are similar.17

Family Planning
Three variables are important in determing the conception rate in any community; 1, the number of women having sexual intercourse; 2, the number of children the average family wishes to have and, 3, the means available for fertility control.

1. The time interval since the new abortion laws were passed covers a period when the
first factor has changed only slightly. The total number of women of reproductive age and
the marriage rate have been relatively constant but the proportion marrying at a younger age has risen. For example, in Hungary the marriage rate altered by 1 5 points per thousand and the percentage of men and women marrying in the twenty to forty age group was 22*6 and 28-7 respectively in 1938 and 43-8 and 38-8 in 1963.34
2. The desired family size in eastern Europe is exceptionally small and is a major
factor in the overall demographic pattern. In 1958-60 in Hungary the average number of children desired by a couple was 2-4 and in 1965-66 241. The last figure is from an extensive survey of 0 5 per cent of all Hungarian women in the fifteen to forty-nine age group (Table 2) and shows that the tendency towards small families is most marked among the young age groups. At the same time the small size of the fraction wishing to remain childless is notable.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

In 50 per cent of the families of salaried employees in Russia there is one-child under the age of sixteen and in only 9 per cent are there three or more children. Although families are a little larger in lower social groups, 72 per cent of farm workers have one or two children under sixteen.26 In Czechoslovakia four-fifths of women who have been married for less than ten years and already have two children do not plan to have any more 28 and, on average, families plan to have 2-3 children.32 The urban Rumanian family couple in Bucharest only want 1P3 children and among the professional classes the number falls to 0.7.42 The Rumanian figures are remarkably low and without parallel, as far as is known,
anywhere else in the world.

3. There is no legal restriction on the sale and availability of any form of contraceptive in eastern Europe and in many countries there are government supported family planning schemes. In Poland the law requires that a doctor give contraceptive advice to every woman who is terminated. In practice only 50-60 per cent of women receive advice.21 In other countries family planning advice is given at all the larger medical centres. Hungary is an
unfortunate exception where there is as yet no government sponsored scheme. In Yugoslavia all contraceptives are free, the condom has been available for many
years, and IUDs are being used. Oral contraception is just becoming available in eastern Europe. Pilot trials are taking place in Poland and it is used on a small scale in Yugoslavia. Czechoslovakia now manufactures its own pill, Antigest, and it will be interesting to see the impact of this reliable and widely acceptable method of contraception on the abortion rates. However, medically based family planning services are a recent thing, mostly having been established since 1960. There remain numerous rural and small urban areas where family planning advice is not readily available. The training of doctors is beginning but has not advanced very far. In addition most of the population in eastern Europe is Catholic
and has little tradition of contraceptive usage. Female sterilization is rarely used, being regarded as "too grave an operation to
be used merely for limiting fertility".38 Vasectomy is even more unpopular as it still remains associated with the Nazi occupation, although Czechoslovakia is at present planning to rescind the laws which make sterilization illegal.
It is difficult to assess the use of family planning methods within a society: questioning is difficult, knowledge of a method is not the same as its use, a couple may not be consistent in the way they use a method, they may use a variety of methods at different times and there are often important differences among different age and social groups. In the Rowntree and Pierce survey 30 in Britain 67f7 per cent of those questioned had used some form of birth control, and the percentage was higher in the younger age groups. In eastern Europe family planning practices are not so wide-spread and 30 per cent 1 of women in Slovenia and 18 per cent in Hungary23 rely on abortion as the only method of family planning.
In Hungary 60 per cent of women use some form of family planning. In the twenty-five to twenty-nine age group 70 per cent practise some method but in the over-forty group this is true of less than half the women.35 In Czechoslovakia nearly half the women knew about contraception before marriage 32 and the use within marriage is probably higher than in Hungary, but in Rumania only 4 per cent of women know about family planning.42
Coitus interruptus is the commonest method of family planning in all eastern European nations (Table 3). It is most frequently used by the older age groups (in Hungary 75 per

cent of women over forty use the method).35 Detailed information is not available for Poland but, except for the fact that the safe period is rather widely used, there is no reason to think it differs widely from the pattern found in other countries. The high incidence of the use of the cap in the one area of Yugoslavia that has been closely studied probably reflects the zeal of the local doctors and is not indicative of widespread use all over Yugoslavia.
There is little doubt that effective methods of family planning will become more widely used if government policy and medical attitudes continue to encourage contraception. In Hungary, where abortion is very frequent, contraceptive practices among parous women are shifting towards more reliable methods (Table 4). For a small group of women abortion has become the family planning method of choice and therefore each year the number of women having their fourth or subsequent abortion increases (1960: I119 per cent; 1964: 15 9 per cent) but over all such women are a small minority.16 When Tables 3 and 4 are compared it is seen that families using the condom or diaphragm make a disproportionately large contribution to the numbers of women aborted. This apparent paradox can be explained if it is accepted that abortion and contraception are complementary methods of family planning and are in no way competitive.

In summary, the eastern European desired family size is perhaps the lowest in the world.
The population relies to a very great extent on coitus interruptus as the main method of family planning. This combination makes for frequent recourse to abortion when conception control fails. Women who try to use mechanical methods of contraception resort to abortion if these fail.

Social Causes
Statistics dealing with the reasons women seek legal abortions are available for most eastern European countries. Usually a constellation of overlapping social and medical factors have to be classified, and categories vary to some extent in different surveys (Table 5).

LEGAL ABORTION IN EASTERN EUROPE

Medical reasons for termination are uncommon, contributing 6 per cent of cases in Slovenia, 10 per cent or under in Czechoslovakia, approximately 4 per cent in Hungary and only 1 per cent in Rumania.42 The size of the established family, accommodation and employment always appear high in any list, and in part are closely related to one another. All over eastern Europe accommodation, while cheap in rent, is short in supply and houses and flats are often small. Many women are in part or full time employment: in Slovenia 80 per cent 24 and in Russia 83 per cent of women in the fifteen to fifty-nine 21 age group
work outside the home and abortions are three times as common in working women as in full-time house-wives.31 In Czechoslovakia between 1958 and 1962 the proportion of employed women having legal abortions rose from 50 6 to 65 5 per cent 21 of the total annual number.
A number of social factors oppose the above forces but the desire for small families appears to override them. For example: in Russia a pregnant woman receives eighteen weeks holiday with full pay, there are family allowances for two or more children, state contributions to several aspects of the child's upbringing and there is a tax on childless couples. In Hungary maternity leave lasts for twenty weeks and the mother's job is guaranteed if she is away for up to three years. Family allowances in Hungary are about to be increased so that they become a significant fraction of the average working wage. This step has been taken to try and raise the birth rate and it will be interesting to see if it makes a measurable impact on the number of abortions in Hungary.

Numbers of Abortions
a. Legal abortions: The reliability of statistics on legal abortions varies from country to country. In Czechoslovakia the laws are carefully controlled at the district level and the central collection of information is good. In Hungary all operations are performed in hospital, the system of registration works well and the small size of the nation makes for accurate records. Less reliance can be placed on the Polish statistics; here private practice persists and many women, wishing to avoid the public atmosphere of a hospital, seek out private practitioners. Although private doctors are required to register the operation errors of enumeration are thought to be common. Yugoslavia is a federal republic and vital statistics are published at a regional level. In the under-developed areas of the country they may not be as reliable as in the industrialized regions. In Yugoslavia compulsory registration of the operation was not introduced until 1960 and the rise in the number of abortions around that date (Figure 2) may be spurious. The Soviet Union presents a particular problem because of its size; the country is ethnically and culturally heterogeneous and overall comment is difficult. Up-to-date national statistics are not available for Rumania or Bulgaria.
Currently available statistics on therapeutic abortion are summarized in Table 6.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW
Material has been taken from published papers and from statistics supplied by the Statistical Offices in Prague and Budapest. Vital statistics are sometimes revised following their initial publication, giving rise to variation between individual sources, but the changes have always
been slight.
In every country the total number of therapeutic abortions taking place has climbed at a different rate and attained a different absolute level (Figure 2). Long series of statistics are not available for Rumania but individual hospitals report a three-or four-fold increase since 1958 and in 1961 in Arad and Bucharest (Filantropia Hospital) the ratio of live births to abortions was 1:7-4 and I :13 respectively.21

The age distribution and parity of women having legal abortions is available for
certain countries (Figures 3 and 4).
b. Criminal abortions and the impact of the new laws: Hospital admissions for spontaneous and criminal abortions appear in the published statistics as "other abortions". It would be unrealistic to attempt to divide the two categories at a national level.
In Czechoslovakia the rate per thousand of the population for "other abortions" fell from a range of 2-3-2-5 in the five years preceding the altered law to 1-8-2-1 in the first seven years afterwards. A fall from 4-4 to 3.4 per thousand took place in Hungary in the years at either side of 1956 when the law was changed. However, these figures may not represent the full change. Prior to changing their laws the nations of eastern Europe were faced with a much more severe criminal abortion problem than exists in Britain at present. Before the law was changed in Hungary there were approximately twice as many deaths from abortion a year as in Britain in a population of only one fifth the size.
All surveys of induced abortion probably underestimate the frequency of the condition because a proportion of women fail to report some or all of their abortions. In Hungary 240

LEGAL ABORTION IN EASTERN EUROPE
only 55 per cent of the legal terminations which are known to have taken place, by reference to medical registration, were subsequently reported in a survey of family planning and reproductive habits.16 Presumably the desire to conceal is even greater in the case of criminal abortions.
Before the law was changed in Czechoslovakia a survey of women who had completed their families (1950-1955) showed that one quarter of the previous pregnancies ended in abortion. It was estimated that after the law was changed some 110,000 to 140,000 abortions would need to be done annually (in fact the maximum was 94,300). It is now thought that the Czechoslovakian laws caused a reduction of 65-80 per cent in the number of criminal

abortions and in the experience of doctors engaged in gynaecological practice criminal abortions have become rare since the introduction of the new laws.4 Mehland has estimated that the combined total of legal, spontaneous and criminal abortions taking place in East Germany has declined from 150,000 in 1950 to 70,000 to 90,000 in 1962.20 The change was unevenly distributed and in some groups (large urban communities, women under twentyone and the unmarried) the rate rose despite the overall fall.
Estimates of criminal abortions at the national level are difficult but deaths due to abortions are easily diagnosed and the registration of vital statistics in most eastern
European countries is reasonable. In all eastern European countries deaths from "other abortions", that is the criminal and spontaneous abortions, have fallen in the year spanning the alteration in the abortion laws. Lukis 19 quotes a decline in the number of deaths taking place in Czechoslovakia from forty-four in 1953 to fourteen in 1963 and Cernoch has

241

THE EUGENICS REVIEW
analysed the same material in more detail and with some revisions (Table 7).4 Similar and sometimes more marked falls have occurred in other eastern European countries. In Hungary there were 100 deaths from abortion in 1950, thirty-seven in 1962 and twenty-four in 1964.36 In Poland the number fell from seventy-nine in 1956 to twenty-six in 1959 22 and in Bulgaria from forty-seven to sixteen over the same years.21

Part of the decline which has taken place in the number of deaths may be due to improved medical care. The larger eastern European nations-Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Yugoslavia-are well supplied with doctors and their standard of medical care is high. For example, the maternal mortality in Czechoslovakia was 0 83/1000 total live births in 1952 and 0 35 in 1962.39 In England and Wales this useful index of medical care is very comparable with rates of 0-67 and 0 35/1000 total births for the same years. However, when the deaths due to abortion and the overall maternal mortality are compared in various countries it seems that the decline has been most marked in those countries which have legalized abortion. In New York City where the legal abortion rate has fallen from 5.1 to 1 -8 per 100 live births in the years 1943-1962, the maternal deaths from abortion have increased by 60 per cent 10 and this comparison is an interesting one because unlike the previous examples it does span the years when antibiotics might have been predicted to
make an effect. A final, indirect gauge to the incidence of criminal abortion is the number of police
prosecutions taking place. Although doctors were more willing to follow up suspected cases of criminal abortion after the laws were altered the number of convictions in Poland, for instance, fell from 513 in 1951 to forty-seven in 1957.41
The criminal abortions which do persist arise from a number of causes. In many countries a proportion of those seeking abortions are refused (Yugoslavia 10-12 per cent, Czechoslovakia 5-30 per cent) and no doubt other women realize they would be rejected if they did apply. Of those refused a substantial percentage resort to illegal abortions. In a group of 700 women refused a legal operation in Yugoslavia 40-50 per cent had criminal abortions. Certain women would rather go to a back street abortionist than enter a hospital where they might be known. Some women will have a second unwanted pregnancy within six months of a legal termination and in most countries will find themselves temporarily debarred from another operation. Finally, in backward rural areas there are women who continue to turn to illegal abortionists from habit rather than necessity.

LEGAL ABORTION IN EASTERN EUROPE
Demographic Consequences The Second World War disrupted the whole of eastern Europe and in many areas
there was heavy mortality, but by the early 1950s social stability had been restored. The demographic revolution which has taken place since that time is of great interest (Figure 5). The birth rate has fallen dramatically in the last two decades; for example, the Polish birth rate was twice that of the United Kingdom in 1952 but twelve years later it crossed below it and in 1965 the UK birth rate was one point higher than that of Poland.

Birth rates /1000 population. The arrows indicate the year in which the law was changed to permit abortion on social grounds. In East Germany (German Democratic Republic) abortion on social grounds was allowed between 1947 and 1950 and reintroduced in 1965.7

The impact of legal abortion on the birth rate is difficult to estimate because it involves
computing the number of illegal abortions taking place before the law was changed, guessing what might have happened to the criminal abortion rate if the law had not been
altered and making an allowance for the changing incidence of contraceptive practices. The number of legal abortions registered each year gives no indication how many
babies might have been born if the law had been otherwise. In 1952 there were 185,800 live births in Hungary and 1,700 legal abortions, Twelve years later, after the alteration of the law in 1956, there were 184,400 abortions but the number of live births had not fallen correspondingly but in fact stood at 132,100 (Figure 6). Therefore, criminal abortion must have been common in 1952 and a proportion of the legal abortions in 1964 would have occurred as illegal abortions if the law had not been changed.
It is possible that the criminal abortion rate in eastern Europe would have risen in

243

THE EUGENICS REVIEW
the absence of an alteration in the law. In England the number of abortion cases being admitted to hospital is rising and as this increase is unlikely to involve spontaneous abortions it appears that the criminal abortion rate is climbing.2

In different countries the abortion rate varies widely (Table 6). Every nation presents
a number of special features. In relation to population, terminations are most numerous in Rumania and Hungary. In both the law is very free but this may not be the most important factor. Perhaps the use of contraceptives, which is poor in Hungary and virtually nonexistant in Rumania, is more important. In Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia the abortion rate has reached a plateau, or has dropped slightly in recent years. These nations
have in this period adopted an active family planning policy and although there is still
much to achieve it appears that contraception is making some impact on the number of
legal abortions. It is possible to get some insight into the complex relationship between legal abortions
and the birth rate by looking at the experience of Czechoslovakia in detail. Since the law was altered to include social grounds in 1957 there have been two minor changes in law and medical practice. By a Government Decree (26th July 1960) several minor hurdles to abortion, such as payment for the operation when performed on other than medical grounds, were removed. The number of legal abortions rose from 77,000 in 1959 to 88,000 in 1960 and 94,000 in 1962. However, this jump in the abortion rate occurred at a time when the birth rate was virtually unchanged (in fact it increased by 500 between 1959 and

244

LEGAL ABORTION IN EASTERN EUROPE
1961). Therefore the change in the number of registered abortions must have involved a large transfer from the criminal to the hospital sector. Under a Decree of 21st December 1962 payment was reimposed and the Commissioners considering terminations were requested to apply stricter criteria. In 1963 the number of legal abortions fell to 70,500 and the number of births increased from 217,000 in 1962 to 235,000 in 1963. What part of this rise was due to women carrying babies to term which might have been aborted and what part was an intrinsic rise in the birth rate is difficult to estimate. Certainly, by 1965 there had been a rise in the incidence of pelvic inflammation from legal abortions and in the suicide rate among pregnant women, and the practice with regard to abortion was relaxed once again.
Yugoslavia is a country in which there is great variation in economic development, cultural backgrounds, and degree of urbanization. The central and southern parts of the country have little industry, religious beliefs run deep and the majority of the population is engaged in agriculture based on village settlements. Near the Italian border and in the province of Vojvodina it is industrially well developed. There has been considerable migration towards the industrialized areas in recent years and this is particularly marked in the cases of Vojvodina where Slav-speaking people have been encouraged to settle near the Hungarian border.
Professor Beric, of the Institute of Mother and Child Health in Belgrade, has studied the effects of legal and criminal abortion on the size of completed families born to women who are (1) natives of Vojvodina, (2) who are immigrant to the area and (3) who are the sisters of immigrants but remained in the area where they were born, such as Bosnia and Hercegovina. Two thousand families have been followed in this interesting survey. Beric found that women born in Vojvodina have smaller families than women who are immigrants to Vojvodina and they in turn have smaller families than their siblings who remained in the more rural, less industrialized, areas (Table 8).

The total number of conceptions in the different areas is comparable, but the average
family size in Vojvodina has been brought down by a greater use of abortion than in the less developed areas (Table 9). It is probable that the total number of conceptions in the various areas is comparable and that abortion has played a major role in determinng the differential number of term deliveries. In Vojvodina immigrant women use abortion slightly less frequently than women born in the area (Table 9). Differences occurring between generations also suggest an increasing incidence of abortion as an area develops economically and becomes more urbanized (Table 10).
In the absence of contraception, or any marked shift in the age of marriage, a frequent
recourse to abortion must occur in all industrialized communities where there is a falling
birth rate. In most areas of Yugoslavia contraceptives are still poorly used but at least they are freely available and government sponsored family planning clinics are being set up. In the adjoining areas of northern Italy the situation regarding contraceptives is much less favourable but the birth rate is similar to that in Yugoslavia. It is possible that among

245

Italian women the use of criminal abortion is comparable to that of legal abortion in their Yugoslavian neighbours.

LEGAL ABORTION IN EASTERN EUROPE
Vital statistics for most eastern European countries do not extend as far back as those for western and northern Europe. However, in rare instances, Church records are tolerably complete over a long period. Figure 7 shows the birth rate as obtained from an analysis of
the Registers in Curugu, a Yugoslavian town in the province of Vojvodina. Information
gathered from Church Registers is open to several errors 8 but the overall trend is easy to follow and any effect from the recent abortion laws can be set against the long-term changes affecting the area.
Social Effects In the experience of eastern Europe legal abortion has been most used by married
women who already have families. Women refused legal abortions have been followed up in some centres. In Prague out
of 555 women refused a legal terminaton, there were 254 spontaneous and criminal abortions and evidence is accumulating that the "unwanted children", who have now been followed over a period of five years, are at a disadvantage when compared with children born to mothers who did not seeek abortions during the pregnancy.33
Among the unmarried, patterns of sexual behaviour are changing rapidly all over Europe and it is the western half which is setting the pace. In Czechoslovakia the pattern of deliveries to unmarried mothers has changed less since the law was altered than it has in the case of married women. Probably unmarried girls always turned to abortion even more readily than their wedded sisters.
Over most of eastern Europe illegitimate children have the same legal status as those born in wedlock and sometimes they do not appear separately in the vital statistics. In Hungary the illegitimacy rate is lower than that in England and Wales. The percentage of

illegitimate births has fallen from 841 in 1956 to 6 3 in 1965. In Poland the rate has remained almost steady, being 34 per cent in 1955 and 3 9 per cent in 1963. In Czechoslovakia the number of children born to unmarried, widowed and divorced women was 14,036 in 1953 but fell to 11,255 in 1963.33 By contrast the trend in the UK has been in the opposite direction, from 4-7 per cent illegitimate in 1955 to 7-2 per cent in 1964.
In England in the sixties, eighteen to twenty cases of infanticide are followed up yearly and twelve to sixteen people convicted. In Poland in the 1920s and 1930s the number was around the thousand mark. The marked decline since that time to between 20 and 50 in recent years is probably partly due to the possibility of legal abortion and the readier access to contraceptives.4'
The use of abortion by young unmarried women and by older married women who already have children is illustrated by Figure 8. The impact on family size of a completely free system of legal abortion, as obtained in Hungary, is illustrated in Figure 9.
Author's Conclusions At the time of writing there is widespread conjecture in England, the United States
and some Scandinavian countries about the possible consequences of altering the law relating to abortion. Although the Communist block is set apart by its political systems the nations at the eastern fringe of the Iron Curtain belong to the European cultural tradition. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Yugoslavia are industrialized; they have large urban

populations; the Christian religion remains a powerful influence. In Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary the great majority is Roman Catholic and churches are still crowded. It is concluded that:
1. A large percentage of women will resort to abortion in order to avoid having more children than they desire. They will do this whatever their religious or ethnic background. Town dwellers appear to use abortion more than their rural neighbours. Limited accommodation, a society where many women are employed, and a standard of living that is neither very rich nor very poor, contribute to the desire for small families.
2. There appears to be no reason for regarding abortion and contraceptive measures as in any way competitive; in fact, they appear to be complementary in their use. In countries like those of eastern Europe, where contraceptives have been poorly used and criminal abortions common, the legalization of abortion on social grounds has been associated with very large numbers of operations. At the same time family planning programmes have been able to progress. In a nation such as Britain, where the practice of contraception is more general than in many countries and the incidence of criminal abortion correspondingly lower, it can be predicted that an alteration in the law would not be associated with such a high legal abortion rate as occurred in eastern Europe.
3. There is no evidence that the abortion laws of eastern Europe have led any significant proportion of the population to be socially irresponsible or that they have in any way undermined the basis of family life. In cutting down the number of unwanted children they may have contributed to the health and welfare of established families.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT I am most grateful to the Eugenics Society for a generous travel grant to eastern Europe in December 1966.
