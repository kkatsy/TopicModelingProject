the need to prevent increasing resort to criminal abortion. Quotations could be given from leading personalities in India, Egypt, Japan and China (four countries together containing over a thousand million people) all clearly showing that they regard some form of family planning as essential to the wellbeing of families in their countries.
If we refrain from considering this standpoint, the representatives of these populous countries may feel that we are closing our eyes to what is for them a basic need.
4. Means of family planning: the rhythm (KnausOgino) method
We well appreciate that irreconcilable differences exist between ourselves and many (perhaps a majority) of the Union's member-organizations on the use of appliance methods of birth control, which Roman Catholics regard as unnatural or artificial. We do not wish to make difficulties by pressing these divergencies.
We note, however, that the rhythm (KnausOgino) method is held by Catholics to be a natural (contrasted with an artificial) method of regulating conceptions and it is to certain unrealized possibilities of this method that we wish to call attention.
That his Holiness the Pope is aware of the evil possibilities of population pressure was clearly shown by his choice ofwords when, on September 8th, 1954, he addressed the delegates to the World Population Conference then assembled in Rome.
" The science of population is young," the Pope said, "but it is basic because it is immediately concerned with human life and it can illuminate certain of the gravest individual and social problems. The Church is not unaware of these problems; she is not indifferent to their agonising* aspects."
The Pope went on to "urge Catholics to take an active part in the research and the efforts which are made in this domain. But we wish that they do this with fidelity to Christian doctrine . . ."
Thus the Pope showed himself keenly aware of the existence of a population problem and of the need for research. That the rhythm method
* The Pope spoke in French. The word he used was "angoissant".

would have high priority in a Catholic programme of research is suggested by the wellknown address which, three years before, the Pope had delivered to the Italian Catholic Union of Midwives.
In a discourse delivered on October 29th, 1951 at Castel Gandolfo, the Pope told the midwives that, in appropriate cases, it was their duty to give advice on the rhythm method, with the theory and practice of which they should acquaint themselves. He said:
" You are expected to be well-informed from the medical point of view, of this well-known theory and of the progress which can still be foreseen in this matter; and moreover, your advice and help are expected to be based not on simple popular publications but on scientific facts and the authoritative judgments of conscientious specialists in medicine and biology."t
Manuals and booklets in many languages have been published on the rhythm method; but relatively few controlled experiments have been organized. The most comprehensive was that promoted in India by the World Health Organization in the course of the years 1951-54. The World Health Organization here acted in response to a request from the Indian Ministry of Health which favoured the rhythm method for three reasons, one of which was that:
it appeared to be consonant with the Indian traditions of self-control and, in particular, was acceptable to Ghandian thought.
Two experiments were promoted. But grave difficulties were encountered and the experiments were rather suddenly terminated.
5. Possibilities of pre-marital instruction in rhythm method
There were several causes of the failure of the two Indian experiments. Cultural, climatic and educational factors, in varying degrees local, contributed. There is, however, one ubiquitous source of difficulty met with in all such experiments, namely, that the rhythm method is found difficult to adopt after marriage when sexual habits and patterns incompatible with the method have had time to become established.

with the requirements of the method. The requisite pattern calls for the observance of regular periods of sexual abstinence within the woman's monthly cycle: the number of days during which abstinence is required depends on the regularity of the woman's menstrual life.
Information on the rhythm method should,
we think, be incorporated in a programme of pre-marital instruction. It is the experience of marriage counselling agencies that prevention (by appropriate guidance before marriage) is better than cure (attempts to harmonize discords which have developed after marriage); and many of these agencies have become persuaded of the value of pre-marital education.
We recognize that different countries have different approaches to problems of sex and of sexual education; and that there are people in many Latin countries who oppose what they regard as too free a ventilation of these topics. Advocates of free public discussion are opposed by advocates of public discretion; and the latter, we know, hold that knowledge of these intimate subjects should be communicated to young people by their parents and not by school teachers and marriage counsellors. But it is also widely recognized that the parents are commonly too ignorant or too shy to be successful educators in this sphere; and that the information which young people do not receive from their parents they pick up in undesirable ways and distorted

Marriage Guidance Council).
It is not on grounds of expediency alone that
we recommend instruction (for those to whom other methods are unacceptable) in how to determine the safe period. Facts and figures are not the only reason for full and frank discussion of our proposals. We believe that sexual instincts have been given to men and women in order that they might express through the body the spiritual affection they have for one another. Marriage is a lifelong partnership and love must be continually expressed and renewed through sexual intercourse if two different-minded people are to live together without tension and disharmony and deceit. We expect single men and women to exercise sexual restraint before marriage but as our distinguished physician the late Lord Dawson of Penn pointed out it is harmful and wrong to ask two young people surrounded by the intimacies of love not to be lovers. Marriage is not only for the procreation of children, but in order that a man and woman should express their love, live happily together and build up a secure and happy home for their children. We
therefore urge on moral and spiritual grounds, and as a positive contribution to successful
marriage, that instruction should be given in this method of spacing a family which is acceptable to all branches of the Christian Church.
