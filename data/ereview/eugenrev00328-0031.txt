THE RELATION OF TEMPERAMENT
TO SIZE OF FAMILY.
BY MAY FREEMAN.
It is a fact familiar to everyone that the average size of the family has been decreasing for many years in this country. The suggestion has often been made that there is some relation between the number in the family and the temperament of the children. In particular it has been suggested that the larger the family the more cheerful are the children; the explanation offered is that an upbringing in a 'young' atmosphere is conducive to cheerfulness. It seems worth while attempting to test this suggestion in view of the hold which the small family system is gaining upon all sections of the population. A small, investigation was therefore planned and carried out in a northern industrial area. While, as will appear, the results are by no means conclusive, they may prove of interest to other workers in the same field.
The method employed was as follows. Children aged from five to ten attending elementary schools were classified by their teachers into two groups, the more and the less cheerful. At the same time particulars were obtained regarding the number in the family. Data were collected in four schools to begin with. The results seemed to be of sufficient interest to warrant the collection of further data and three more schools were added making seven in all. The total number of children regarding whom particulars were obtained was 1805. The investigation was restricted to children of the ages mentioned because it was thought that into the lives of children above these ages many more influences enter, some of which might obscure the effect, if any, that size of family has upon temperament.
The head teachers of all the schools except one were seen personally by me. In the case of this one school directions were given by correspondence. The object of the enquiry was explained to the head
teachers at the outset, but was withheld from the junior teachers until the data had been collected. The junior teachers were asked to divide their children into two groups, the more cheerful and the less cheerful. It was clearly explained that "cheerfulness' was not 'alert-
ness,' 'brightness' or 'cleverness' but rather 'happiness.' Pains were taken to ensure that the basis of the classification was clearly understood. The justification of the use of teachers' estimates of intelligence or of temperament is to be found in the results of the now numerous

170 EUGENICS REVIEW.
enquiries which have shown a high degree of correlation between estimates so made and measurements carried out by other methods.
The teachers also ascertained the number in the family by questioning the children. By 'number in the family' is meant all living children. The errors involved by this method of collecting the data are probably not as large as might perhaps be expected. Owing to the shortage of houses there is less moving from district to district than formerly and in consequence the teachers gain an intimate knowledge of the circumstances of their children. I was present on many occasions when the teachers were obtaining this information, and I was much impressed with the extent of their knowledge, as often shown by the fact that they detected errors in the accounts given by the children of the composition of their families. It was thought better not to attempt to obtain the number of children living at home and to exclude those living away for two reasons. Though away at the time of the enquiry these members of the family would in many cases have been recently living at home and so adding to the family circle. To omit them would on that account lead to more errors than it would correct. Further these absent members have influenced the home and the parents in the past and in some cases do still influence them directly to some extent.
The results of the enquiry are summed up in three tables. The first four schools are lettered A to D and the last three X to Z. Table 1 shows the percentage of 'cheerful' children in families of different size.

The general impression gained by an examination of the table is that there is a higher percentage of cheerful children in families of medium size than in large families, whereas the very small families stand in an intermediate position. Table 2 shows the distribution of cheerful children according to size of family. This table gives the same impression as before. In Table 3 an attempt is made to submit the figures to a more accurate analysis. It shows the difference in the

percentage of cheerful children in families of four or less and five or more and also the probable error of the differences in the different
schools.
It will be observed from Table 2 that the proportion of cheerful children to all children varies considerably from school to school.

It might be suggested that the character of the building would be
reflected in the temperament of the children. It is true that the schools in this area differ markedly from one another, some buildings being gloomy and others bright. Since, however, both school A, which, among the first four schools contains the largest proportion of cheerful children, and school B, which contains the smallest proportion *of such children, were both housed in buildings that were old and gloomy, it does not seem likely that any weight is to be attributed to
this factor. It is possible that to some extent the temperament of the head teachers may influence the children, but it is unlikely that this is
so to any large extent. It is much more probable that different standards of cheerfulness have been adopted by the teachers in different schools. This is to some extent a disturbing factor, but it does not vitiate the results because, whatever standard was adopted, it was
applied irrespective of the numbers in the family. The impression gained from the first two tables, that families of
four or less are more cheerful than families of five or more, is examined in Table 8.

[*This school was exceptional in showing a higher percentage of cheerful children in the larger families.]
It will be seen that the differences between small and large families as thus defined, are certainly not significant for schools A, X and Z. The difference is in the region of significance in school B; it is barely so in C, D, and Y. If, however, it is justifiable to combine the figures of the different schools, we are dealing with much larger numbers so that the probable error decreases and the difference then appears to be significant.
When it is asked what conclusions, if any, can be drawn from this investigation, it must first be remembered that the methods employed were somewhat rough and ready both as regards the estimate of 'cheerfulness' and the ascertainment of numbers in the family. Bearing this in mind, it does not appear that there is any marked relation between cheerfulness and size of family. The indication is that smaller families are more cheerful than large families defining a small family as one containing four or less children. If this is so, then either the influence of many young children playing together, being brought up together, of a 'young' environment in fact, does not make for cheerfulness, as is often supposed, or its influence is overborn or counteracted by other factors. Before asking what other factors there may be, it should be pointed out that the children attending elementary schools pass much of their time in the streets playing with children of other families, and that, in fact, in this sphere of life, an only child may be less cut off from companionship than appears at first sight. It might be interesting to extend the enquiry to boys at public schools whose opportunity to mix with other children is much more strictly confined to members of their own families. In any case it cannot be taken for granted that the influence of young companionship is much less among those of the children included in this investigation who come from small families than it is in the case of those who come from large families.
What other factors may there be which bear with different intensity upon children from families of different size? It is probable that the parents of the smaller families are on the whole those in the better social and economic position and it is possible that since cheerfulness is an asset in life, they owe their position to some extent to the possession

of innate predisposition towards cheerfulness which they have passed

on to their children. This is a possibility not to be disregarded. It is

certain, however, that, where the family is large, there is a g)reater

strain upon the family resources. The recent investigations of Mr.

Rowntree and others have shown how great the pressure is when there

are a number of children in the family under school-leaving age. In-

adequate food and clothing are more common in large than in small

families and the parents in such families must themselves suffer more

from worry and anxiety. Conditions in large families among work-

people can hardly tend to cheerfulness and may well counteract the

cheerful influence of a young environment, if indeed, as is doubtful,

there is any considerable difference between the large and small

families of workpeople in this respect.

In conclusion, I should like to express my thanks to Mr. D. Caradog

Jones for the assistance which he has given me in the preparation of this

paper.
