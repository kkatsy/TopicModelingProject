JAPAN'S POPULATION PROBLEM
By C. P. BLACKER

D R. L. N. Jackson's " Passport to Tokyo," which appears elsewhere in this number, provides a compact yet
comprehensive survey of the wide ground covered at the fifth international conference of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) held from October 24th
to 29th, I955, at Tokyo. The present
article has a narrower scope than Dr. Jackson's. Its object is to outline the contemporary predicament of Japan as it was described to us in some thirty-three papers by Japanese authorities and as it is set forth in
a valuable booklet-a model of clarity and succinctness-produced just before the conference by Dr. Minoru Muramatsu.
On the last of this booklet's I20 pages will -be found a postscript which might well have -appeared as a preface. The signed postscript is dated August I955 ; hence, allowing for delays of publication, the documentation could scarcely be more up to date.t Unless otherwise stated, the figures given below are taken from this booklet.
*This article is based on an account of the Tokyo
conference given by Dr. Blacker to Fellows and Members of the Society on Wednesday November 23rd, 1955, at 69 Eccleston Square. The paper submitted by Dr. Blacker to the Tokyo conference was published in the last (January 1956) issue of the EUGENICS REVIEW.-EDITOR.

Dr. Muramatsu is the assistant in chief of Dr. Yoshio Koya who is head of the Department of Public Health and Demography in the Institute of Public Health. The Institute is attached to the Japanese Ministry of Welfare. Hence Dr. Koya and Dr. Muramatsu (both of whom I had the pleasure of meeting at the International Population Conference held in Rome during September 1954) hold official or semiofficial positions under the Japanese Government.C.P.B.

Demographic History
During the 264 years of the Togukawa Shogunate (I603-I867), Japan's population is thought to have remained approximately
stable, having fluctuated round the figure of about thirty million. Japan was then much cut off from the outside world; she was economically self-sufficient and her natural resources weie clearly seen to be finite. The realistic outlook of the people and of their leaders coupled with the feudal character of
the then prevailing culture aided the taking of drastic measures to adjust numbers to resources. Both abortion and infanticide were freely practised, and we are told that the term mabiki, originally meaning the thinning of seedlings, was undiscriminatingly used to denote these two measures.
After the Meiji restoration (i868), however, infanticide was suppressed and the country was opened up to western influences. The population then increased fairly rapidly until, by I9I2, it had reached 5I.6 million. In response to the pioneering and crusading zeal of Dr. Kan Majima and also of Baroness Shidzue Ishimoto (now Mrs. S. Kato: this lady played a prominent part in the Tokyo conference, having been chairman of the conference's planning committee, and being, with Dr. Koya and Dr. Majima, a vicepresident of the Family Planning Federation of Japan), a birth control movement was started shortly after the first world war. The movement reacted vigorously to an early visit (in I922) to Japan by Mrs. Margaret Sanger (to-day's president of the IPPF) after which a clinic was opened in Tokyo. But officialdom, which had always been suspicious, became actively hostile in the late twenties when pro-natalist policies were introduced by the government then in power. In I940, a National Eugenic Law

31 THE EUGENICS REVIEW, April 1956, 48, 1.

32 THE EUGENICS REVIEW -

(not to be confused with the Eugenics Protection Law of eight years later) was introduced, of which the main purpose was the " building up of a larger and stronger nation."
With the ending of the second world war, Japan was confronted with a truly formid-
able problem. The birth rate (34.3 in 1947: see Figure 2) was the highest for over twenty years
-higher than it had been throughout the
period of pro-natalist propaganda; the death rate (I4.6 in I947) was the lowest then on record; room had to be found for some
four to five million repatriates ; towns were in ruins, the war had been lost, and Japan was shorn of her empire. The population (70.8 million in I939) had swollen by over seven million (78.I million in I947, see Figure i). Figures i and 2 show the trends which
have since prevailed. In the course of the last nine years, the birth rate has steadily
declined. From a figure of over 34 per thousand in I947, it has fallen to below 20 in I954. But this noteworthy decline in fertility has been more than offset by the newly acquired powers of death control. The death rate (see Figure 2) which for earlier years had been conspicuously and consistently lower than the birth rate, has fallen

from the figure of I4.6 in I947 (the lowest on record at that time) to that of 8.2 in I954. This last figure is lower than that of the death rate in England and Wales; but the disparity, seemingly favourable to Japan, is attributable to the differing age-structures of the two countries' populations, that of Japan being younger than ours.* It will be seen from Figure I which shows the growth of Japan's population that numbers have increased by about a million a year from 78 million in I947 to an estimated figure of nearly ninety million last year. Japanese demographers regard it as almost inevitable that, twenty years hence, the figure will top the hundred million mark.
It is little wonder that apprehensions and forebodings are widely felt. Some of those expressed at the Conference are touched on by Dr. L. N. Jackson in that portion of his paper which is headed " Japanese Misgivings." The precarious balance of the country's economy, based on foreign aid, and the consequences for Japan if that aid
* The expectation of life at birth is higher here than there by over five years for men and by over six years for women. Age-specific death rates are generally lower here than there.

were cut off, are only too well understood. The existing prevalence of unemployment
and linderemployment are an unescapable
reminder of the hazards of the future. So
is another factor not mentioned by Dr.
Jackson: the agricultural land of Japan is so intensively cultivated and sustains so large an agricultural population (see below) that the countryside can provide work for few more. people ; hence there is a massive drift to the big towns where life can be sustained on imported food and where employment can be found in factories. The earnings of the industrial worker, howevrer, compare favourably with those of the agricultural labourer. As a legacy of General MacArthur's regime, trade unions are developing. But wage claims entail rising
prices, and rising prices entail export difficulties. Yet the slogan " export or starve," with which we have become familiar in Britain since the war, is more applicable to Japan than to us. I was tQld by;a Japanese economist that the drift to greater Tokyo from the countryside enlarges the population of that city by between 300,000 and 400,000 people a year.
Professor Juitzi Kitaoka (all influential

economist) is quoted by Di. JiLckson as saving that many young Japanese would welcome a communist revolution in the preposterous hope that their country's problems might thereby be solved. (This remark was one of the few features of the conference which was reported in the British press). One is reminded by Professor Kitaoka's warning of Dr. Colin Bertram's observations* about the disturbing effects of abnormal degrees of population density on the
behaviour of certain animals; and about how comparable reactions-mainlv of morbid excitability and proneness to violence-
might occur among human beings.
The population pyramid for Japan (Fig. 3), based on the figures for the I952 census,
is in a general way characteristic of countries wvhich have reached the late-expanding phase of the population cycle--when birth and death rates are both declining, with the death rate 'at a lower level than the other throughout. Each tier or horizontal block here represents a five-year age group (quinquennium). Three points are noteworthy.

FIGURE 3. POPULATION OF JAPAN AT I952 CENSUS
(United Nations Demographic Yearbook, 1954)

The first is the deficit (reflecting war casualties) of males (born between I908 and I927, aged from 25 to 44 in I952, and from i8 to 37 in I945) compared with females. A glance shows that the tiers relating to these four age-groups are shorter on the left side of the figure than on the right. By how much shorter they are can be seen by a comparison
of the figures at the outer extremities of the tiers showing percentages of males and females during these twenty years. How the war upset the balance between the sexes can also be seen by comparing these considerable differences with the small differences between the proportions of the sexes in other age-groups. The deficit of males aged twenty-five to forty-four in I952 represents war losses amounting to some two million killed. This feature of the pyramid

-a deficit of males of certain age-groupsis characteristic of countries which have
suffered heavy casualties in the world wars. The second noteworthy feature of the
pyramid is the slowing down of the rate of
increase during the decade I933 to I947the prewar and the war years ; people born during these fifteen years are represented by the last three tiers but one in the figure wNhich, on each side, differ little in length.
The third and perhaps the most noticeable feature is the wide base provided by the bottom tier which represents children under five. This feature may seem at first sight difficult to reconcile with the fact that, as Figure 2 shows, the gap between birth and
death rates was narrowing between I948 and I952. The fact, however, is that no agegroup benefited more during these years

from the decline in mortality than that comprising young-children. The infant death rate fell by some twelve points from 6I.7 per thousand live births in I948 to 49.4 in I952.

Population and Arable Land

The United Kingdom and Japan can be
usefully compared. The figures are taken from a paper entitled Some Remarks on the Overpopulation of Japan, by Professor J. Kitaoka who quotes as his source the U.N.'s
statistics for I954 and those of F.A.G. for

I953.

It will be seein that Japan's population aind
also her total area are substantially larger than the U.K. 's but that Japan has less
arable land than the U.K. (about five-
sevenths, much of her country being mountainous) ; that she has less than half the arable land per head of total population; and that, having an agricultural labour force more than sixteen times larger than ours, she has less than a twentieth of the area of agricultural land per agricultural worker.
In the course of excursions to Nikko,
Atami, Hakone, Kyoto and Nara we passed through both flat and mountainous country. The intense degree of the cultivation of the arable land-almost wholly by hand aind much of it under rice--was noticeable. There were few visible draught animals, cattle, sheep or machines ; but tethered goats were commonly seen. Holdings seemed very small, and there was little grass or grazing land. Superficial impressions of tourists are not reliable guides to truth ; but for what they were worth, ours made it understand-

able that Japan's agricultural labour force was large and that there was little room for more people on the land. Indeed, the introduction of mechanisation into agriculture, far from employing more people, would in-
crease the already considerable redundancv.

The Eugenics Protection Law of 1948
The above-described post-war predicament of Japan called for urgent action. It is this urgency which accounts for the
drastic nature of the provisions ol- the
Eugenics Protection Law of I948. This act, whiclh facilitates the resort to sterilization, abortion and birth control, has been amended five times between April I949 and September 1954. Its object is declared to be: " To prevent an increase of inferior descendants from the standpoint of eugenic protection, and to protect the life and health of the mother." Most of the amendments seem to have facilitated the resort to these three practices; the most important-that made in May 1952-absolved doctors from the necessity of obtaining in advance (from an officially appointed Eugenics Protection Committee) approval for a proposed abortion. The outcome of the act is that the practice of all three methods of restricting births has greatly increased in the last six
years.

Sterilization

There has been a sixfold increase between 1949 and 1954. Operations reported as

having been performed under the provisions

of the Eugenics Protection law are as follows:

1949 ... ... 5,752

1950 ... ... 11,403

1951 ... ... I6,233

1952 ... ... 22,424

I953 *--

... 32,55

I954 ...

... 38,056

The great majority of the operations were

on females. In only about one in forty

cases was the subject a male. The- main

reason for the operations performed in I954

was maternal protection-about 96 per cent

of cases. The remaining four per cent com-

prised the following categories : Hereditary
diseases (under one per cent : 333 cases in

36 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

1954) ; and leprosy (I22 cases). The Law
(article 4) seems to make provision for what amounts to a modified compulsion: the physician can apply to a Prefectural Eugenic Ptotection Council to decide whether a per-
son should be sterilized because of some
thirty physical or mental diseases which are
set out in a list annexed to the Act. In
I954, 840 persons were sterilized undel this provision, about four in ten being males. In the event of a person suffering from mental
diseases or deficiency of such a sort that he cannot give a valid consent, the Act (article
I2) makes provision for such a consent to be
obtained from " the person responsible for the individual "-the spouse, parent or guardian where available or, in the absence of such, the mayor of the- individual's towii or village. In I954, i6o persons were steri-
lized under this provision. Sterilizing operations are rather more often
performed on rural than urban populations -in the ra.tio of 54.4 to 45.6. The method of cornual (intra-uterine) cauterisation instead of tubal ligation is also performed. Dr. Yoshio Furusawa, of the Sumida hospital, Tokyo, presented to the Conference a
paper describing 293 sterilisations performed in his hospital during the two years January I953 to December 1954. Of these, 2I3 (72 per cent) were by electro-cautery, 53 by tubal ligation and 27 by vasectomy. Good results are claimed for the method of tubal cauterv which is, of course, far simpler than that of tubal ligation. Another valuable paper on the former method was given by Professor B. H. Shears of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the University of Malaya, who seems to have developed a reliable and satisfactory technique.

Abortioni

The numbers have increased between fourand five-fold between 1949 and I954. They are as followvs:

There was some criticism of the Govern-
ments abortion policy. Attention was drawn
to its possible harmfulness, especially if performed after the third month of the pregnancy, and to the rapidity with which further pregnancies often ensued. It was also argued by Dr. Yasuaki Koguchi, of the Public Health Department of Kanagawa Prefectural Government, that the reasons for terminating pregnancies given in the official returns could differ from those entered on the clinic cards used at the hospital. Diseases and abnormal conditions
mentioned in the official returns were sometimies niot recorded on the hospital casesheets. It was fairly obvious that misgivings were widely felt about the course of events, and that these lent weight to the
policy of replacing the abortion policy by
one of birth control.
Abortions were rather more commonly sought by urban than by rural populations, the ratios being roughly the converse of those above-quoted for sterilization.
The cost of an official abortion was remarkably low. A sum of 300 yen (six shillings) was commonly charged, and sometimes as little as 50 yen (one shilling). That is to say that an abortion could cost less than a contraceptive appliance-a matter much discussed in Japan.
In addition to the million or so abortions officially recorded in the last two years, we were told that account had to be taken of an approximately equal number of clandestine abortions. In Dr. Muramatsu's words: " It may be safe to say that there are upwards of two million induced abortions in recent years in Japan as a whole and that the number of induced abortions somewhat exceeds that of live births. (My italics). Live births in I954 amounted to I.7 millions which, as shown in Figure 2, yielded a birth rate of just under 20 per thousand. Hence if the two million or so pregnancies which ended in abortions had resulted instead in live births, the birth rate of Japan might have exceeded forty per thousand and the country's demographic predicament would have been grave indeed. It is against suich possibilities as these that Japan's abor-

tion policy, which the Japanese are the first to criticize, must be assessed.
Birth Control
No less than thirteen surveys of the prevalence of contraceptive practices in Japan have been made between I947 and I954. Of these the most comprehensive and also the latest was one conducted by the Ministry of Welfare in April I954. No less than I23,000 householders were approached by a questionnaire method. There was a 76 per
cent response (94,ooo householders) which
suggested that birth control was then being used by 33.2 per cent of the sample. This figure was higher than that yielded by earlier surveys. It is noteworthy and important that this inquiry was conducted by a Ministry, a circumstance which I believe to be unique. I know of no other country where such an inquiry has been officially conducted. The nearest approach to such a course inBritain was that adopted by the Royal Commission on Population (1944I949). But here the investigation (that which bears the name of Dr. E. LewisFaning) was carried out as it were by proxy. The responsibility was taken by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and some apprehensiveness was felt throughout about the possible effects of a premature and misleading publicity.
An elaborate organisation exists in Japan for disseminating as quickly as possible a knowledge of birth control. The programnme makes available appropriate training for qualified doctors who then become known as " designated physicians." Of these, in August I954, there were over nine thousand. The " designated physicians " relay their knowledge to a much larger number of " practical instructors of conception control," most of whom are licensed midwives. Of these there were, in August 1954, over 28,ooo. The training programme is undertaken by the Ministry of Welfare (weekly courses three times a year for doctors) and also by Prefectural Governments (there are forty-six prefectures in Japan) which hold courses for doctors, midwives, and nurses. These courses have elaborate syllabuses:

that for nurses requires over sixty.hours of
instruction.
The education of the public is also con-
ducted by " country-wide publicity campaigns through'radio and newspapers and by cinema films." We were shown such a film made at a fishing village (Fukuura) which
we visited. Here Dr. Yoshio Koya had
initiated an intensive education of a village population in birth control principles. The film included a diagrammatic demonstration of the processes of reproductive physiology which was of a frankness and realism which would have nmade the film's exhibition in an English village, and, Lady Rama Rau told me, in an Indian village, impossible.
Japan's Ministry of Welfare has in the last three years stepped up its annual budget. The sum allocated to the promotion and
practice of contraception in I955 (58,686,ooo
yen) was more than twice that of the previous year (28,860,ooo yen) ; and I have been un-. officially informed that, in the plans for I956, a sum three times larger than that for 1955 is
contemplated. These large-scale investigations, compre-
hensive administrative arrangements, and
substantial budgetary allocations all testify to the urgency with which the Japaniese Government regards the tasks of checking the widening resort to abortion and of replacing it by the more acceptable practice
of birth control. The birth control methods which have been
found most acceptable are noteworthy. Contrary to the expectation of western observers, the condom is easily the most favoured method. The following figures as to its use as a single method are hereunder compared with the next most favoured single method:
