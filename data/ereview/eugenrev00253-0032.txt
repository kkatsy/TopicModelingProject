CURRENT NOTES ON DEMOGRAPHY
By D. V. GLASS

1. Population Movements in France during the War.
D-\ URING the occupation of France,
the customary annual publication
of current vital statistics (the volumes entitled Statistique du Mouvement de la Population) was abandoned. Instead, statisticians turned their attention to historical demography and produced, under the auspices of the Statistique Ge'nerale, a series of admirable studies on the historical aspects of fertility, mortality, naturalization and migration.* Now, however, the French Statistical Office is endeavouring to make up for lost time, and the new volume of Statistique du Mouvement de la Populationt provides comprehensive data for the years 1939-42 inclusive. The object of this note is to draw attention to some of the more important points brought out by the new statistics.
The general trend of replacement is shown by the following table (Table I) of official reproduction rates.+ From I935 to I939 these rates follow a course similar to that

shown by many other Western countries, a

general upswing which may have been con-

nected with increases in employment. The

fal in I940 and I94I is comparable with,
that experienced in England and Wales, and

so is the rise in I942, though the fall is

greater and the- rise less in France. It will

be remembered that both the fall and the

rise in France after I940 took place while

the male population was substantially de-

pleted. In the 87 Departments, according to

the official estimate, the male population

fell by just over 2 millions between January

Ist, I939, and December 3ISt, I942, the

bulk of the fall occurring in the first half of

I940.* Thus, as Gasc pointed out (cf.

EUGENICS REVIEW, I945, 37, p. 62), the fall in fertility in 194I was really less, and the rise

in I942 greater, than the figures suggest.

It is officially estimated that about 8oo,ooo

married men were out of France in I940,

and more than 6oo,ooo in I94I. The folow-

ing table shows the comparative legitimate

fertility rates (per I,OOO married women

aged I5-49 years) calculated on all married

women as well as on those married women

however, to interpret these results, just as

it is difficult to estimate the full effect on

A closer examination of the fertility

fertility rates in Table IV, though the fall as between I930-32 and I942 iS greater. In addition, the rate for the age group 20-24 years
appeared to be higher in I942 than in I930-32,
in spite of the general depletion of the
French male population. It is of interest, even though the basis is not very certain,
to see the legitimate "fertility rates as re-
calculated for married women whose hus-
bands were in France,* for here, again, the greater steadiness of the older groups is shown.
Perhaps the most interesting statistics are those in Table VI, showing.the changes in the distribution of births order among legitimate births.t
The rise in fertility from I936 to I939 did not produce any marked changes in the distribution of births of the various orders

But during the war and the occupation, first and second births fell off,+ arid even the rise in 1942 did not bring the position back to that of the pre-war period. Taken together with the changes in marriage frequencies, shown in Table VII, this development suggests both a postponement of marriage
and of first and second births within marrage.

This appears to be confirmed by the statistics of legitimate births by duration of marriage. Of all legitimate births (including still births) in I939, 49-2 per cent were born to marriages of under five years' duration, whereas by I94I the proportion had fallen to 43 o per cent.* Thus any improvement in or even stabilization of circumstances might result in a spurt of marriages, and perhaps an even greater spurt of births. Marriage rates began to rise in 194I and births in I942. The provisional birth rate for I943 was I5.9 per I,OOO, as compared with I4.3 for I942.

Still higher rates might be expected for i944
and I945,+ and the statistics for those years
should be most instructive.
* This process had been developing consistently tor some time. The proportion had been 66*3 per cent in I920-24, 53.9 per cent in 1925-30, and 52.5 per cent in 1931-35. The first of these periods was, of course, marked by the abnormal circumstances of the immediate post-war years. In 1942 the proportion rose to 44.8 per cent. In part, of course, the development is produced by changes in the absolute numbers of marriages, of which there were only I69,971 in 1940 as compared with 247,358 in 1939. t P. 2I.
t War-time population statistics for France are based on 87 instead of the pre-war go Ddpartements. The birth rates for 1942 and I943 are based on 86 D6partements, and are cited from Revue de l'Alliance Nationale, June-December, 1944, p. 50.

2. The present position of French Population Policy.
Although modern French population policy began in the late nineteenth century, no attempt was made to codify the various branches of pro-natalist legislation until the issue of the Code de la Famille, by a
decree-law of July 29th, I939. In its I67
clauses, the new Code covered the whole field, ranging from birth premiums and family allowances, through agricultural loans and income tax rebates, to the law against abortion and the provision in all French schools of instruction on population questions. The Code both extended the range of pro-natalist legislation and raised above all previous levels the monetary assistance given by the positive measures.
The various clauses could not all be applied simultaneously and inmmediately. In many cases special regulations were necessary before the measures could come into force. But the general unfolding of the Code proceeded without serious interruption under the Vichy r6gime, which in any case made the " protection of the family " (including- the biological aspect) one of its main tenets, and a similar continuity has been shown by. the De Gaulle administration since the liberation of France.
The general task of implementing " family policy" now belongs to the Ministry of Heajth, which contains within itself a special

CURRENT NOTES ON DEMOGRAPHY

secretariat devoted to this function, the
Secretariat General d la Famille et td la
Population. In addition, stemming from
this central secretariat, are local officials in all the regional prefectures, the Delhguis Regionaux a la Famille, whose mandate is to assure the implementation of the " family
policy " at the regional level, and who serve as links between the public authonrties and individual families and family associations.
The new organization thus apparently re-
places, on a larger scale and at a more
effective level, the Haut Comite de la Population set up in February I939 to consider the overall question of population in France. Part of the duty of the new central secretariat is to survey population trends, and
presumably the results of such surveying
will be taken into account in remodelling existing measures or introducing new ones. The present point is thus a convenient one
for seeing, before such potential changes
occur, how the main lines of policy have
developed under the Code de la Famille. Since the most important clauses of the original Code have already been summarized
elsewhere, the present notes will deal only with those measures which have been changed in any- substantial way, or with
new measures.
A number of changes have been made in the family allowance system, which continues to form the chief positive measure in the pro-natalist hierarchy. First, the allow-
ances are now paid to widows if they are not themselves engaged in employment
which entitles them to allowances in their
own right. Secondly, the upper age limit for children in respect of whom the allowances are paid has been raised to 20 years, provided that such children remain at their studies.
So far as the allowances themselves are concerned, they continue to be paid as from the second child, a national birth premium being given instead for the first child if it is born within two years after the marriage. But the allowances have been increased. Under the Code they were I0 per cent of the average wage (in the Departement concerned) for the second child, and 20 per cent for the third and each subsequent

child. Now they are I0 per cent for the second, 20 per cent for the third, and 30 per cent for the fourth and each subsequent child.* At the same time the special allowance in respect of wives who did not take up paid employment (for the mere au foyer) has been largely given up, except for those families not entitled to the salaire unique allowance. The latter allowance, which is now the more general one, is given (in respect of a wide range of employees) to families in which there is a single earner, as a supplement to the basic family allowance, and the rates are also calculated on the average wages of the Departements concerned. They amount to I0 per cent for a childless couple during the first two years of married life ;t 20 per cent for an only child under five years of age, and I0 per cent for one over five years of age; 20 per cent where there are two or more children, but only one is still dependent; 25 per cent for two dependent children, and 30 per cent for three or
more.$ Combining the two forms of allow-
ance, a wage-earner's or employee's family with four dependent children would thus receive grants amounting to go per cent of the- average wage of the Departement in which they live, as compared with 6o per cent uncer the original Code.
Within the general sphere of allowances is the pcukle (a lump sum grant), designed to encourage families to return to rural life. This appears to have replaced the agricultural loan which was criticized for its high
interest charges (41 per cent) when the Code
was issued. The new grant consists of the capitalization of half the amount of family
* In October 1944 these rates were raised temporarily (for six months) by 80 per cent for families with two or three children, and by 50 per cent for
families with more than three children. Note also that in addition to having separate average Departemental salaries calculated for urban and rural occu-
pations, the urban rates may be increased by up to I 5 per cent for families living in towns with over 200,000 inhabitants (including thekr immediate suburbs). The latter measure does not appear to be a temporary
one.
t The allowance for a childless couple is temporary, supposed to end with the issue of the decree setting the official end of the war.

50 per cent.

include such manual workers as masons, miners and agricultural labourers, but also skilled and professional workers.* Every effort should be made to speed up assimilation, but, at the same time, definitive
naturalization should in the majority of
cases be replaced by an intermediate stage, giving limited rights and easily revoked if necessary.
There would be no difficulty in reducing
mortality. The means of doing so are known,
and it is primarily the money that is lacking.
Special emphasis is, however, laid upon housing and decentralization as well as upon reducing the consumption of alcoholic drinks.
To raise fertility, Professor Sauvy pro-
poses an attack on the broadest front. On the negative side, he visualizes new, strin-
gent measures against abortion, supported by the positive inducements of allowances
during pregnancy, free medical advice and attention during and after pregnancy, and the opportunity for unmarried mothers of
having their confinement in conditions of medical secrecy.t On the more general, positive side, -he would begin by offering marriage loans, on the German model, with the object of lowering the average age at marriage, believing that a permanent move in this direction would result in higher marital fertility." For a first-born child
there should be a grant to cover the costs
of clothing, and for every child there should be a substantial " family allowance." This latter should be supplemented by a " hous-

that, should fertility become too high, it would be

better to encourage birth control than to tolerate

abortion, though he doubts if the need is likely to

arise. But in Richesse et Population, p. 315, he writes

" Birth restriction being necessary in some degree,

it would not only be illusory but also dangerous to

attempt to get rid of it entirely." He also suggests

in the latter book (p. 3I6) that in the interests of

quality it would be desirable to make use of steriliz-

ing allowance," to be raised primarily by increasing rents in general and using the increase to provide proper accommodation for families with more than two children.*
Children should entitle their parents to substantial rebates in income tax, fares and
charges for gas and electricity, and large families should be especially favoured, for
example, in awarding scholarships, in the allocation of employment, and in reducing
the term of conscription. Sterility and
celibacy should not be penalized as such, but the celibates and childless should bear a larger part of the financial burden of the nation. Married women should not be prohibited from continuing inr part employment. But a special allowance (e.g., the salaire unique allowance) should be given
to enable them to stay at home without
sacrificing their standard of living and provision should be made for part-time employment which would not interfere with their household responsibilities.
In the general economic sphere, every
effort should be made to increase employment and production, and apparent overproduction should be attacked by increasing
consumption. t At the same time, old people
should be encouraged to work and earn in addition to receiving their pensions.
Knowledge of the facts of population should be spread widely. Propaganda should stop picturing procreation as a duty and the family as an end in itself, and should, instead, demonstrate that everyone will benefit if the population is maintained. The goal should be normal families of three or four children, not prodigies of eight or ten.
Finally, there should be universal suffrage in the full sense-a vote for everybody, including children. A child's vote would be exercised by his mother while he was less than ten years old, and by his father during the rest of his minority. This, Sauvy argues,

in France has been unduly controlled, forming only about 4 per cent of working-class budgets. But he insists that any increase in rent should go to the State, not to the property owners.
t On the other hand, Sauvy is opposed to " excessively- rapid" technical progress and would be prepared to levy a small tax,-in certain cases, on firms making innovations in their methods of production.

would ensure the full representation of children's and family interests.
The above summary scarcely does justice to Professor Sauvy's plan to ensure that, as he defines it, children shall be " public friend number one." Many of his proposals are much more subtle than has been indi-
cated. Though the plan suffers from some
inconsistencies, and the basic figures used in defining the objectives are very approxi-
mate, yet as a whole the programme is more comprehensive and realistic than even the latest proposals of the Alliance Nationale, while at the same time it is free

from the dogmatism which sometimes mars
the publications of that organization. Nevertheless, it is very much in the general tradition of French population policy. In spite
of the goal of families of four or five children,
there is -still no explicit acceptance of
voluntary parenthood. Thus the analysis of Professor Sauvy's proposals confirms and amplifies the conclusions of the previous section. There are indications of a substan-
tial future increase in the amouint of French policy, but it does not seem very probable that its general quality will be affected in
any significant way.

To the Editor, Eugenics Review
SIR,-I do not think Mr. Dunlop has been quite fair in his short criticism (April issue) of my letter on the above subject (January issue). I have never suggested that " undevelkped territories should be given to those powerful nations which have a high birth rate and are also aggressive." I suggested that restrictions on immigration to such territories should be removed in the case of vigorous peoples of the same primary race as those already settled. Furthermore I did not say that wars would thus infallibly be prevented, but that, if

nothing were done to provide room for the expansion of vigorous peoples with high birth rates, further wars of aggression or conquest must come sooner or later, simply because no other solution to their difficulties is possible (except perhaps birth control which they will not adopt). This proved to be true in I914 and in I1939, and as long as the root cause of these wars is not removed, it will prove true again, however little we may like certain "vigorous peoples."
