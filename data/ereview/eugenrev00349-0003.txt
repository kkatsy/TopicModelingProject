THE
EUGENICS REVIEW

THE SEX RATIO AT DEATH.

IN a previous paper I stated that the balance of the sexes in the popula4ion is affected by two physiological causes, viz., the sex ratio at birth and the sex ratio at death. The former has given rise to endless speculation and controversy and has been made the subject of countless disquisitions, while th-e latter has, on the comparative side -at any rate,
been cutriously neglected. The progress of a generation through life has not inaptly been com-
pared to the march of an army which throughout is subjected to a deadly fire from the enemy. It has been further noted that the incidence of this fire is not spread equally over the whole course of life, that it is much more concentrated and deadly at certain ages than at others. If we
divide our army of the population by sexes it will be found that there is a differentiation in the intensity of the fire directed on the two armies, and
that in the European countries, over a given period', a male army of equal numbers will suffer heavier losses than one composed entirely of females. Moreover, the severity of the respective losses would be found to occur at different periods, and if instead of one army we imagine a group of armies, each one rep.resenting -a separate country, it will be found that the ratio of loss between males and females differs according to the country which they represent. To illustrate and amplify this picture I have prepared a few ,tables relating to nine European countries in which the armies of males and females thave bee.n reduced to equal numbers, in order to show the respective ratio of loss between sexes in these different countries. The period selected has been years 1910-19II-1912. The losses are calculated on the total deaths in the respective populations during those years; and the populations at ages and sexes have been calculated
on 'the basis afforded by the Census of I910-II.

In Table I. is given the ratio of male deaths to a ioo female deaths

at all ages during the years in question. It will be seen from this table

that among an equal number of males and females in the population of

England and Wales 113 males died for every Ioo females, and that in

every other country dealt with in the table there was a considerable

excess except in the case of Ireland, where the male deaths show a

I I4 EUGENICS REVIEW.

slightly lower xatio than do those of females. What the meaning of this ratio in England and Wales is in regard to the balance of the sexes and the population, may peThaps be made clear by the statement that had the deaths among males been at the same ratio as it was among females, 45,000 males who died during those years would have survived. In other words, the excess of male over female deaths among equal numbers of the population represents a loss of I5,000 male lives annua,lly.

For the purrpose of comparing the respective losses at various ages
I have divided the population into four age groups, viz., infancy, cover-
ing the period from birth to the age of five years; childhood, from five
to I5; adult life, covering the period from I5-65; and age, covering the
period of thofse who survive beyond the age of 65.

Table II. shows the relative incidence of sex mortality in two divisions, under the age of one and between one and five. It will be noted tha;t in the first age group there is little variation except in the case of Italy, in which the excess is only So per cent. of that in the countries coming next above it in the table. In the age group i-5 there is a striking fall in the excess of male deaths, which in Ireland and in Italy are on a
lower ratio than those of females.

In Table III. is given the ratio for the period of childhood, extending from the ages of 5-15; and from this it will be seen that only in the Netherlands, among the nine countries, is there an excess of male deaths at this period of life; while in. France, Italy, and more paticularly in Ireland, there is a very considerable excess of female mortality during
this period.

This table presentsi some very cuTious features. In England and

Wales and in F,nan.ce rthere is throughout a steady increase in the relatiive

mortality at each age group, bu-t -this is not the case with any other of

the seven countries. The increase in the case of England and Wales is

from 113 at ages 15-25 to I3 at ages 55-65. The rise in the relative

mortality is very much more ma,rked in the case of France, being only

io8 at the earliest age group and having risen to 156 in the latest. In

the case of Norway, while at ages 15-25 and 25-35 theTe is a very heavy

excess of male mortality, this excess has almost disappeared in the next

age grou.p, viz., 35-45, and is considerably lower in the two last age

groups than it is in the two first. In the case of Sweden we find a con-

sid:erable fall in the second age group as compared with the first, and a

further fall in the third age group, followed by a sudden and considerable

I 16 EUGENICS REVIEW.

rise in the fourth and a further very slight rise in the last. In the case of the Netherlands there is also a very marked drop in the second a.ge group as compared with the first, followed by a very slight rise in the third. In both of these latter age groups there is a considerable excess of female mortality. In the age group 45-55 there is again a sudiden and marked rise followed by a slight increase in the last group. In Denmark the second group shows a heavy fall from the first, followed by a still heavier rise in the third and fourth and a less marked rise in the last group. In Scotland there is li-ttle difference between the first and second age groups, while the rise in the third is compiaratively slight. T;his, however, is succeeded by a violent bound upward in the fourth group, followed by a. very slight fall i:n the fifth. In Italy the first and second age groups show no change in the relative mortality of the sexes, and throughout this 20 years it is considerably lower in the case of males than of females. There is a mairked rise in the third age group, a less considerable one in the fourth and a :noticeable decline in the last. In Ireland there is a small rise in the second age group, in the third the natio is stationary, and in. the fourth there is a relatively marked increase, followed by a decline in the last group. It will be seen that the variations in the ratio of the different ages are somewhat remarkable. In the case of England the variation amounts to I8, in the case of France to 48,
Norway 22, Sweden 20, Netherlands 27, Denmark 38, Scotland 25, Italy 25, and Ireland only io.

The picture of relative mortality is completed by giving male and

female deaths in two groups, viz., ages 65-75 and over 75. Italy presents

a, marked contrast to all the other countries, as iit shows an excess of

female mortality in oid age. In Sweden -the variation is extraordinarily

violent between the two age periods, but there is nothing to ca.ll for

special remark in regard to the other countries.

Looking at the tables as a -whole, it will be seen that in the case of

England and WVales there is only one age period, viz., that of childhood,

in which the relative male mortality is lower than the female; and that

even here the difference is very slight. The same remark holds good

with regard to F.raLnce, Norway and Sveden, though in the first two

TIHE SEX RATIO AT DEATH.

I l17

named countries the male advantage is considerably greater during the period of childhood. Scotland has one period, that of childhood, in which there is a female excess, while in the age group of 15-25 the mnortality of the two sexes is equal. In the Netherlands, while there is
an excess of male mortality in childhood, there is a curiously marked excess of female moxtality at ages 25-45. Denmark, with an excess of
female mortality in childhood, has an almost identical excess at ages 25-35. In Ireland there is a male excess in five age groups, with a female excess in the other five. From ages 1-45 an excess of female mortality is shown, while under one and from 45 upwards male mortality is in excess. In Italy at -six of the age groups a female excess is shown, and on-ly in four is male mortality in excess of female. The feature by which Italy distinguishes itself from Ireland is, as already noted, that in. old age there is a cetain advantage, slight it is true, on the side -of the males.
Perhaps a more accurate picture of the physiological incidence of sex mortality would be obtained by excluding deaths from all forms of violence, suicidal, homicidal and accidental, and confining our tables to those causes which, for want of a better name, are generally described as "natural." I have done th,is for England and Wales, Scotland, Ireland and Italy, and the results are shown in Table VI.

I I8 EUGENICS REVIEW.
In this table the relative mortality is given at all ages and in the vari,ous age groups from childhood upwards. In the case of deaths under five there is practically no difference in the ratio, whether deaths from violence are excluded or not. It will be seen at once that the exclusion of deaths from outside causes makes a very material difference in the relative ratio of mortality, particularly in certain age groups. For all
ages the g.reatest ireduction is shown in the case of Scotland, which falls from Io6 to 102. In England and Wales and in Italy the fall at all ages
is only two, while in Ireland it is one. In the case of Engl-and and Wales the greatest reduction is shown in the age groups in the earlier stages of adult life. At ages 15-25 the reduction is I4, while at 25-35 and 35-45 it is i I. In Scotlan-d the greatest reduction is shown at the same ages, but it is between 25-35 that the maximu,m fall is recorded. In Italy the maximum fall is from 25-45, while in Ireland the fall is almost equal
throughout the age .period 15-55, .and nowhere does it exceed five. In this tablle there -are two age groups, viz., 5-25, in which female mortallity is in excess of male in England and Wales. In Scotland 'the period
extends from 5-45, in Italy from I-35 and from 65 upwards, and in Ireland fTrom i-65.
Summang up the results shown by this last table, it would appear that in England and Wales there is a heavy excess of male montality in the first year of life; th-at 'during thoe next fow years females have a somewhat better chance of life than males; that for the next ten years there is a considerable advantage on the male side; that from 15-25 the chances, apart from deaths by violence, are almost equal; and that throughout the rest of life the males are at a more or less considerable disadvantage. In Scotland the same rearks hold good for the first I5 years of life, while during the next 20 years there is a marked advantage on the side of the males, and for the ten years 35-45 this advantage continues, though in a much diminished degree, while for the rest of life the
advantage is even more markedly on the sid-e of the females. In Italy the female advantage is much lesis during the first year of life, while up
to the age of 35 the advantage is entirely on the side of fthe males, is passed to the fem,ales for the next 30 years, and is regained by the males at the extreme end of life. In Ireland, after the great initial advantage of female infants under one, the advantage remain's with the males up
to the age of 65 and only passes to the females in old age. It would be an interessting and not unprofitable study to endea.vour
to ascertain what are the precise factors which go to make up these differences in the incidenoe of sex mortality, but at the present moment I have nei.ther the time nor the material to enter into thi's somewhat complex question. All I can do for the moment is to submit these
elementary considerations and to leave it to more leisured and capable hands to continue the investigation.
