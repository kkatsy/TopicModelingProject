41 Z EUGENICS REVIEW

Gerrard, THE REV. THOMAS J. The Church and Eugenics. (No. IV.,

Catholic Studies in Social Reform.) P. S. King and Son; 6d. net.

THE greater part of this book calls for no special comment: it

has been written (and reviewed) about twenty times already,

written in slightly different words by slightly different authors

with slightly different misconceptions of the meaning of Eugenics,

but substantially the same. It contains the usual isolated quota-

tion from Galton as gloriously shocking in its divorce from its con-

text as Friday's footstep alone on the shore, the usual assertion that

Dr. Inge is a bad, wicked man (or words to that effect), and the usual

implication that Eugenics and Purity are divergent and alternative

ideals. Whether the object of this is to set a few credulous gossips

against Eugenics, or merely to amuse the author, is more than we can

tell. The only novelties in the book are the word " Mendelianism,"

and a heroic attempt to defend the Church's practice of celibacy as " the

best possible thing for race culture." The boldness of this amazing

argument amply compensates for the thinness of its logic. Putting aside

the cruder absurdities, the author's case for Monasticism re§ts on the

statement that charitable and devotional character is not heritable. The

proof of this statement is not tedious: it may be quoted in full. It con-

sists of one word, " obviously." That, of course, settles it. Eugenics

is dead.
