An Analysis of Gestation Period Patterns
of Women having Live Births registered
in New Zealand during the Two Calendar
Years I962 and I963
THE ACCURATE DETERMINATION of human gestation period patterns is of far-reaching importance for legal and health reasons as well as for demographic studies. The differences between such patterns from similar racial groups but dissimilar environments within a country, together with the differences in racial characteristics, indicate the need for more detailed examinations of available data in order to isolate specific gestation period characteristics.
In New Zealand the legal classification of foetal loss is dependent upon the duration of gestation of the embryo. A still-born child is defined in law as one "which has issued from its mother after the expiration of the twenty-eighth week of pregnancy and which was not alive at the time of such issue".* Different birth registration formalities and documents are requited by lawt for:
(a) live births, (b) still-births, and (c) foetal loss, where the period of gestation is less than twenty-nine weeks.:
The accurate determination of gestation periods is important in the interpretation of foetal loss by cause of death. The World Health Organization distinguishes between normal and immature infants at time of birth as follows:
An immature infant [is] one with a birth-weight of 51 lbs. (2,500 grams) or less
at birth. If weight is not specified an infant with a gestation period of less than 37 weeks is considered as an equivalent of an immature infant. The reason for preferring a border-line on a weight basis rather than on a length of gestation basis is that the latter is liable to error and too often involves surmise whereas birth-weight is a physical measurement and is likely to be the more correct.§
Diseases which are peculiar to immaturity, to duration of gestation, or which have a higher probability of occurrence in immature infants can often be isolated from the body of data relating to the particular disease. The effectiveness of an accepted remedial action for each level of infant development can thus be more accurately assessed.
In New Zealand the 1961 Amendment Act to the Births and Deaths Registration Act of 1951 makes the registration of all live births compulsory and requires the medical practitioner present at the time of birth to record on the birth registration application forms, inter alia, the child's birth weight and the mother's period of gestation. The Government
Statistician prepares summariesll from the birth registration application forms for the New

The accurate measurement of gestation for all conceptions within any specified period is practically impossible as the incidence of spontaneous and induced abortion together with foetal loss where the gestation period is less than twenty completed weeks is unknown. Accordingly, this analysis is based upon the records for all completed pregnancies for the years 1962 and 1963 and incorporates 98-4 per cent of all registered births in New Zealand for those two years. The remaining 1X6 per cent relate to registered births where the period of gestation is unknown or to multiple births.t

The medical practitioner present at time of birth determines whether the child is stillborn or not. For this purpose he uses the World Health Organization's definition of a live birth.t Errors in the basic gestation period data will occur from mis-interpretation and misunderstanding of the live birth definition by medical practitioners as well as from the method used to determine the gestation period. An example of such errors is seen in the rhythmical movement observed, with the emphasis on the even-numbered weekly duration, in each of the four gestation period series. This error has been considered by some Govern-
ment authorities§ to be relatively unimportant. However, not all such authoritiesll are satisfied with the existing method of assessing the gestation period and they are endeavouring to get data specifically related to the menstrual cycle of the mother.
Table 1 indicates the changes, between the two years, in the relative importance of births during the 40th week of gestation for each of the four series. The changes are dramatic and reflect either:
(a) a fundamental instability in the reproductive characteristics of New Zealand females, or
(b) the arbitrariness of the methodology of collecting such data.
Furthermore, as the differences between the arithmetic means of each series and between the standard deviations of each series (see Table 2) are not statistically significant, both the shorter and longer gestation periods must have increased in approximately the same

proportion. Owing to the possibility of inaccurate data* a significance level of 99 9 per cent has been chosen for this statistical analysis.
The determination of an "average" period of gestation poses certain methodological problems when attempting inter-series comparisons. Because of the degree of skewness present in all series there are significant differences between calculations of the arithmetic mean and the median. In all cases the median is below the arithmetic mean-the smaller the coefficient of skewness the closer are the "averages". Differences between the "averages" of at least one day are observed in all series.

Critical Ratiost indicated significant dissimilarities, at the 99 9 per cent level, in all arithmetic means and standard deviations between the Illegitimate Non-Maori and the other two Non-Maori series. No significant difference was found between the All-Maori, and the Non-Maori Illegitimate series.t Although the critical ratios between the years for each series are not statistically significant yet they are surprisingly large for yearly differences due solely to biological change. The rate of change in the pattern does suggest, therefore, that although the All Maori arithmetic means have remained relatively constant, factors other than biological are in operation.
With over 68 per cent of all births occurring during the fortieth week a very severe leptokurtic curve is derived from each series. A lack of consistency in the kurtosis measurement between years reduces the validity of inter-series comparison. But the lower kurtosis

value for Non-Maori Illegitimate births does support the lower value of the coefficient of skewness also observed for this series. The coefficient of skewness for Non-Maori Illegitimate births is less than that for All Maori births which in turn is much less than that for the Non-Maori Legitimate data.
Summary and Conclusions
The possible existence of errors in the basic data necessitates the use of extreme care in attempting to reach incontrovertible conclusions. The following tentative conclusions have, however, been drawn from the foregoing examination of the data available:
1. The measurement in New Zealand of human gestation periods, in completed weeks, by the medical practitioner present at birth, is at present unsatisfactory and the magnitude of the fluctuations between years strongly suggests the incidence of inconsistent evaluations by medical practitioners generally.
2. An analysis of the difference in "average" gestation periods between series is subject to the statistical conflict of the meaning of the definition "average". Significant differences are observed between median and arithmetic mean values from the same series.
3. Although the All Maori mean gestation period is not significantly different from the Non-Maori Illegitimate mean gestation period, the difference between the two series in the proportion of births occurring during the fortieth week is significant. It is not possible, therefore, in this type of analysis to rely upon any one single measure of central tendency as being representative of each series.
4. The mean gestation periods, and the proportions of births occurring during the fortieth week, of the Non-Maori Illegitimate and Legitimate series are both significantly different for the Illegitimate series-illegitimate births have a shorter duration.
5. The All Maori mean and the proportion of births occurring during the fortieth week are significantly different from the All Non-Maori statistics-All Maori births have a shorter gestation period.
6. Although they are not in themselves statistically significant, small increases in the median duration of gestation between 1962 and 1963 are observed in all series-this may reflect either random statistical aberrations, a more precise recording of data, or a slow biological change.
7. Differences between the statistical characteristics of each series are not large enough to alter materially the shape of each curve; all series are positively skewed, leptokurtic, and have standard deviations of at least eleven days.
