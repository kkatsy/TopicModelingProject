gross reproduction rates from the crude
birth-rates, and the margin of error therefore rises. For mortality data he uses female
deaths in the age group o to c29 years inclu-
sive, and the Demonferrand life-tables for the years I8I7-3I, in order to estimate the number of female survivors (in a life-table
population) at 30 years of age. He finds that this latter figure gives a very close approxi-

F¢rtility in France
Depoid has previously published various sets of reproduction rates for France. In his new paper he attempts to cover the whole of the nineteenth century and to bring the position up to the eve of the present war, His calculations really involve three discontinuous series with different orders of accuracy:
(a) From I890 onwards the data are adequate for the customary computation of female life-tables and for female fertility values by five-year age groups."
(b) From i851I to I890 the data are
adequate for life-tables, but age-specific fertility rates have to be calculated by substitute methods. Depoid's substitute method involves the assumption of certain trends in the fertility of each five-year age group, but the error involved is relatively small.

mation to the ratio between the gross and
net reproduction rates.*
On these various bases, Depoid computes gross and net reproduction rates for fiveyear periods from i8o6 to I935. He also computes annual rates for the whole period in question, but these are subject to still further margins of error and scarcely seem to add to the value of the other calculations. The results of the five-year computations
are shown in Table x.
Even allowing for the approximate nature of the early nineteenth century rates, it is evident that, at their highest, French reproduction rates were below the level of other European countries. They never, for example, reached the level of the G.R.R. in England and Wales in I870-22-i.e., 2-35; and for most of the period were substantially lower than the Swedish rates-in fact, until the late I920's. When mortality is taken

(c) From i8o6 to I850 the data are highly inadequate, since not even the age structure

: Actually, statistics of the distribution of births by
age of mothers are available for I892 and subsequent years.

* This is the case because the age of 30 approximates quite closely (for France) to the mean age of mothers at childbirth and to the length of a generation. Both of these quantities vary over time, as the age-fertility schedule alters, and Depoid tries to make allowance for this when he calculates annual reproduction rates. The method is certainly closer to the ratio (N.R.R./ G.R.R.) than that suggested by E. Batson (South African Journal of Economics, 1937, pp. 487-8),
namely (TxI-Tx2) /10 (x2-x,), where xl and x2
are the lower and upper age limits of the fertility schedule. For example, for Australia, 1932-4, the
correct ratio would be o .9Io; Batson's method would
give o *899 (as it assumes an even spread of fertility throughout the child-bearing ages) and Depoid's method o * 9 I .

about 6oo,000 wives in these age groups whose husbands are prisoners of war. If this estimate is correct, the up-swing in fertility after I940 is remarkable. But before accepting Gasc's conclusion, we need to know more about his basis of estimation. It is therefore to be hoped that the Statistique Generale de la France will soon publish the annual volumes of population statistics necessary for a more detailed analysis.

into account, the French rates were not, at their highest, more than a few per cent above unity. This, again, contrasts markedly with England and Wales, where at the highest point (in I880-2) the N.R.R. was about I53. The generally flatter curve of reproductive trends, perhaps indicative of more
deeply rooted familial patterns *or of the social and economic forces conditioning them, may have prevented a sharp decline after the first world war, comparable with that found in other European countries. But it also had less elasticity during the postdepression rebound. Depoid's estimates show
that in Italy, Sweden, England and Wales and Germany, the percentage increase in the net reproduction rates between I933 and I939 was significantly greater than for France.

tion rates for France for years subsequent to

Fertility in Spain
Almansa's study of Spanish reproduc-
tivityt is concerned primarily with the
position in I930-I of .the country as a whole and of its different regions and provinces. Gross reproduction rates are computed in the customary manner, and net rates are derived by the approximate method suggested by Depoid-namely by using female survivors at 30 years of age as a mortality coefficient. Separate survival ratios appear to have been prepared for each region and for each province. The! results for the regions and for the country as a whole are given in Table 3.
The high reproductive level of the country as a whole and of many of the regions is immediately apparent. To find comparable gross reproduction rates in England and Wales we should have to go back to I890-2,

at which time the rate for the whole country was about I-77 and that for the County of Durham (the highest at the time) 2-57. Even in Catalonia, the most urbanized and densely peopled region, the rates are relatively high, the average for the region being pulled down by the low rate-i-oii-of the province of Barcelona. The other provinces in the region-Lerida, Gerona and Tarragona-had G.R.R.s of I-3I8, I-I47 and I-094 respectively. In the most fertile region-the
Meseta-some of the G.R.R.s were over 2-4. This was so for the provinces of Segovia,
Burgos and Palencia. On the other hand,
the high wastage rate of fertility is amply shown by the ratios between the gross and net reproduction rates. The female survival ratio (i.e., N.R.R./G.R.R., equivalent, for Almansa's computations, to the probability of surviving to the thirtieth birthday) was
not higher than o0796 for any of the regions;
it was below o0750 for 8 of the ii regions and for Estremadura it was only. o-688. The ratio for Spain as a whole was o0704. The probability of surviving to the age of 30 in
England and Wales for I930-2 was o-868 (English Life Table No. io); For New
Zealand in I93I the probability was 0925.
Theoretically, therefore, it might appear that Spain in- I930-I was a country in which it would be relatively easy to raise the net reproduction rate. It was sufficiently behind the Western European current of decline for the gross reproduction rate to continue at a high level for some time, while the introduction of modern methods of social hygiene-

especially for reducing infant mortality, which was II3 per i,ooo in I93I-5-would substantially lower death-rates. Published official statistics do not make it possible to
ascertain in any detail the trend of vital rates since I932. But from the estimated
reproduction rates and other data given in a study by Jimeno* we can obtain an approxi-
mate picture of what has happened under the
impact of the civil war. Jimeno gives gross and net reproduction
rates for I922, I932 and I937, the rates for the last year presumably being based upon an estimated age distribution of women in the child-bearing groups. Unlike Almansa, he does not construct his own life-tables; instead, he takes Italian life-tables for years with comparable Spanish and Italian crude death-rates. This, of course, introduces an element of error, but for 1932 the difference
between his survival ratio and that given by Ahimansa for I930-I for Spain as a whole is under I-5 per cent. Jimeno's main results
are given in Table 4.

The figures show a decline in the gross
reproduction rate of almost 20 per cent between I932 and I937 as compared with about ii per cent between I922 and I932.
No rates have been calculated for subsequent years. Over the short period, however, a fairly close approximation can be reached from the general fertility rates-
that is, the number of live births per I,OOO women aged I5-49 years. This rate is given by Jimeno as 85-30 for I937, 75.44 for I938, 62TII for I939, 91i93 for I940, and 73-64 for I94I.t The gross reproduction rate would thus appear to be about I-25 in 1941 and even the peak year of I940 would still be well below the I932 level. Uiless, therefore, mortality had fallen markedly-and this

* See footnote, p. 6i. t Jimeno's estimated rate (all figures for 1938 and subsequent years are provisional) for 194I agrees very well with Almansa'5 estimate, which is 74.

seems very unlikely, as far as can be judged from the crude death-rates*-the net reproduction rates for I937, I938, I939 and 194I would be below unity, the figure for I94I not
being more than o-9. Jimeno himself finds a
similar result by using the Burgdorfer index. Confirmation of the precise order of the fall of reproductivity must await publication of the age and sex data of the I940 census. But it is probable that the decline of fertility in Spain in the period I93I-4I was greater than

in most other European countries. In I93I, Spain was one of the few European countries in the " high zone," in terms of net reproductivity. In I94I she had fallen almost to the level of the United Kingdom. Since then, the crude birth-rates have risen again.* It will be interesting to see whether the reproductive balance can be restored or whether, after a temporary rise, the rates will once more continue downwards.
