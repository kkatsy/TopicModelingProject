TFhe Fertility of the English Middle Classes.
A Statistical Study.
BY
.T. W. BROWN, MAJOR GREENWOOD, M .R.C.P., and the late FRANCES WOOD. O.B.E., B.Sc.
PREFATORY NOTE.
The researchl upon which this paper is foun(de(d %was left inl ani imiinished state in the sumllmeir of 1915 when the collaborators ha(d to relinquish their ordinarv tasks for wvar-work. At that timle, abouit two-thirds of what we imiten(led to publish were ready for press. Since (leatli has (lissolved our partnership, I had to choose between abanidoning the research, comipletina the inquiry and(I assuliming sole responsibility for its conclusionis. or publislhing in an abbreviated fornm so much of it as hadIbeen approved by all three of us. I have (lecided to adopt the third course. The only changes made in the originial draft have been omissions of passages which I thinik we should have re-considered andl the abbreviation of others which seemed to nieed better statistical justification or to have lost their importance. In its presenit form, the paper is a very modest contribution to knowledge, but I hope it may be of interest to those who have the opportunity to make more extend(led investigations.
AM .G .
The data of this study were collected by a conmnmittee of the Birth Rate Inquiry Commission (National Council of Public Morals) Dr. Agnes Savill being the member to whose exertionis the success of the undertaking was due.
Two schedules were issued by the coimittec (see appendix) the object being to collect particulars respecting an adequate sample of
married women who had plursued a course of education of university standard and similar informationi respecting a sample of women
-usually relatives of the preceding-who had not done so. In thlis way, it was hoped to throw light upon the question of
middle class fertility in genieral anid to determin:e the effcets upon fertility of educationi. In all, 787 schedules were handed to us; 492
related to university wonicii, 295 to others. Of the latter, 140 related to unlmarried womiiein ancd wAere (liscarded. In all, 634 schedules were used in some part or the whole of our investigation. The colleges and Universities represented are showni in table I. As will be seeni in the appendix, iniformationi was sought on
the schedules witlh respect to a large number of topics, some of which hardly lencd themselves to statistical evaluation, while others

are onily indirectly related to the subject of fcrtility. We shall confine our attention to (1) Fertility in its relation to age, duration of marriage and education. (2) The prevalence of artificial restric-
tion and its effect uponi fertility. (3) The question whether the
observed rate of fertility is adequate to mlainitain the numubers of the miiiddle classes bv natural increase.

We shall in the first place describe the system of tabulation adopted and the sources of error encounitered.
As the dates of birth,marriage and filling in the schedule were entered, we could tabulate by the niearest age of the wife at nmarriage, (e.g., 26 years and 7 months entered as 27 years, etc.,) and the nearest durationi of marriage. Unfortunately an appreciable number of schedules did not provide the date of marriage and a smaller number only gave the year, not the monith of birth. Our rule in such cases was to subtract the calendar year of marriage from the date of filling in the schedule, to obtain the durationi, or the calendar year of birth from that of nmarriage to obtaini the age at marriage, unless the latter was actually entered This niecessarily involves a possible error of as much as eleven months and could not be avoided so far as the age at marriage was concerned
-by assuming the figure placed in the square provided for age at
Imarriage to be the age at the previous birthday, since some of the writers had interpreted the question to meani the nearest age, othersthe majority-to mean the age at the previous birthday (we could test this, of course, on the schedules giving full particulars as to dates). Comparatively few, however, failed to give the month of birth, so that the errors as to age were small; but in the case of durations they were more considerable, and might be relatively important for durations of less than, say, ninie or ten years. Oni this account marriages of less than niine years' duration were omlitted forin the tables subsequently defined as " select " if the niearest (luration could niot be ascertained. With respect to the age of hiusband, since the schedule did not provide for the entry of his date of birth, we had to use the figure entered as age at marriage. As we have remarked, this figure did not in the case of the wife always represent the age at the previous birthday, but it generally did so. Probably therefore it would be fair to

i160 EUGENICS REVIEW.
add six months to the mean age of husband as shown in our tables to render it comparable with that of wife.
The process of tabulationi was complicated by the existence of ambiguities and inconsistencies in the returns, e.g., the age at marriage was sometimes not to be reconciled with the date of birth, or the duration of marriage was inconsistent with the ages of children born. To render the final results as accurate as possible, the whole of the data were first classified and analysed by two of us, and then reclassified by the third, who corrected any slips which had beeti iima(le in tabulationi and reworked the various coefficients.
It is worthy of note that although the schedules were filled in by educated persons the number, of evidently incorrect particulars was appreciable, a fact which proves that the method of inquiry by schedule even when carried out under peculiarly favourable circumstances is subject to an observational error, (distinct, of couirse, from the error of sampling which we can mieasure approximately,) of sonie nmagnitude.
In tabulating size of faimiily we inclucded still births aild miscarriages during the last two moniths of pregnianicy, buft their number was smnall, see table XXXVI. WVe (lid not inelud(le existinig pregniancies, even if of more than seven months' duratioli. As we inlcluded imiscarriages, the omission seems illogical, but the wordiing of the schedule did not expressly provide for the recordinig of existinig pregnancies, so that the returns may have been incomplete anid the recorded proportion of pregnant womiieni too small.
o The first part of our inquiry is to com-pare the feitilities of college and non-college women. Since this was intended to
measure the supposed effect of education uponl fertility, it was
necessary to select those schedules which would admit of legitimate comparison from the proposed point of view. We therefore rejected (a) Schedules conitainiiig imperfect particulars as to marriages
of duration less than nine years, (vide supra,). (b). Schedules relating to pupils in physical training colleges. (c) Schedules relating to pupils
whose stay in residential colleges was less than three years. (d) Schedules relating to students who had taken no examinations at all (academic failure was not a ground of rejection, we included pupils who had sat for but failed to pass their examinations).

The residues form our ' select' experiences. We then prepared tables to which the rejected data were admitted *and the resultant 'aggregate' experiences were analysed. Finally all data were assembled and the consequent 'general aggregate' analysed. The results are summarised in Tables XXIV. and the various detailed Tables II. to XXIII. enable the reader to repeat or modify our calculations. With respect to the actual analysis, we may note that Sheppard's corrections were not used since some of the distributions did not fulfill the conditions which justify their employment. Further, the correlation co-efficients involving the age of the husband were not computed throughout for it became evident that the inclusion of this variable would not sensibly increase the accuracy of predictions from regression equations, a conclusion
reached by the analysts of the Scottish Census of Fertilityt. It will
be seen that the constants of 'select' and 'aggregate' tables differ from one another so little that it is a matter of indifference which are used for comparative purposes. Comparing the university and nonuniversity groups we find that the age at marriage of the former is higher and their effective fertility lower as we should expect. The question is whether rthe dif-ference in mean size of family can be entirely explained by such divergences of mean age and duration of marriage i To answer this question we must employ some form of regression equation and, before doing so, must enquire whether such an equation of the first degree is sufficiently accurate for the purpose.
Mr. Rae's analysis -of the Scottish Census returns demonstrated, on the basis of very large numbers, that the regressions of the different variables one on another were not linear. That the same is generally true in our case will appear from the figures in Table XXV. In strictness, therefore, we ought to have calculated regression equations of higher degree than the first. But, not to speak of the serious addition to the work of computation, there are objections to using formulae based on higher moments when the number of observations at our disposal is very limited. The point therefore arose whether a first degree equation although theoretically inadequate might not be practically sufficient. To throw light on this point, we decided to compare the predictions yielded by Mr. Rae's equations of the first and second degrees with the observed values in a small random sample. This would tell us how far his predictions were actually improved by the use of a regression equation of higher order than the first. The results of this test are shown in tables XXVI. A. & B. Our test is, of course, incomplete, but we think the following inferences are warranted by it. (1). In the case of marriages of moderate duration, there is little to choose between the results predicted with the help of a first degree equation in terns of age of wife at marriage and duration of marriage, or by aid of a formula involving second order terms. (2). For marriages of completed fertility, the results obtained by using a first degree equation in which 46 minus the age of wife at marriage (vide infra) is used for the dura-
*Schedules without particulars of husbands' ages were not rejected, for the
reasons stated in the text.

TI'HE FERTILITY OF THE ENGLISH MIDDLE CLASSES.

tioni of tlle fertile period are not seriously less accurate thani those furnlished by ani equation of the second degree, but somewhat over estimate
the probable size of family. We think, therefore, that comlparisonis of college and nioni-college
fertilities, where allowances for age and duration are made with the lhelp of simple equations, are legitimate. We also think that the pre-
(lictionis of completed fertilities, although less satisfactory, may be sufficienitly accurate for the purposes of our discussion and in the presenlt essay we shall not use any equations of degree higher than the first.*
Returning to the comparison between college and non-college wvomiien, the Regression Equations are given in Table XXVII., while the results of correctinig for age and duration of marriage are shown in Table XXVIII. In Table XXIX. the method is applied to the data col-
lected by MIrs. Sidgwick avid somc notes are added with respect to another investigation. All these results lead to the same conclusion, viz., that, payinig attenitioni to the errors of sampling, there is no differenice betweeni the average size of the family of a mlon-college mother and that of a college mother which cannot be explained by differenices of age at irmarriage and duration of marriage. In other words, our analysis confirmiis the opinion of Mrs. Sidgwick that there is no physiological differenlce between the fertilities of the two classes, that the alleged prejudicial
effects of higher education per se upon the capacity or inclinationi of womnen to bear children do niot exist.
The whole preceding argument has been based upon a groupinig of iiiaterial subject to a theoretically important objection. The durations of niarriages were tabulated without paying any attentioni to the fact that in a few instanlces such durations extended beyond the age at whicl child bearing ceases. This method of tabulation must lowerthe correlation betweeni size of family anid effective duration, assuming that durations cxteiidinig, say, beyond the age of 46 are physiologically ineffective
from the present point of view.
To determine the effect of this another set of correlation tables was
prepared, duration of marriage being now defined as the actual durationi
or 46 years less the age at marriage wheni the marriage lhad extenided
inito the niormally inifertile period. Then the various conistanits were recalculated and are compared with the previously stated results in
Tables XXX., XXXI., XXXII., XXXIII.

For very short luratioms, e.g., one or two years, the regression equations arc quite untrustworthy, thus in the case of (1uirations of no vears at all thev will still give a positive value for tlhe size of family, and again for very lonig durationis, such as would be got by not limiting the duration in the manlner (lescribed above, they will lead to absurd results. It Imiust be clearlv understood that their value is restricted within definite limits.

The report above quoted refers to a similar enquiry amongst American WVomen Students carried out in 1885,t and figures are given showing that in 196 Marriages of American Women Graduates with an average D)tration of 6 7 years the mean family was 1.342. No mentioni is made of the Age at Marriage, but if it is assumed that in the average they married at the same age as the 1887 English Students, viz., 26.7 years, the predicted family according to the Select College Equation would be 1.892+.068, using the Aggregate College (duration as per schedule) equation 1.861 ±.067, and the Aggregate College (duration limited to 46 years minus age at Marriage, 1.838 ±.066.

T90 90UGENICS REVIEW.
It will be seen that the differences although in some instances significant from the sampling aspect, are absolutely small and that in this material it hardly matters which tabulation is used. The reason is, of course, that very few of the marriages were of lonog duration. In data to which this limitation does not apply, it would be necessary to deal with the matter more carefully. It is hardly sufficient to assign an arbitrary terminus ad quem since the epoch of menopause is variable.
It having been suggested to us that the average families of women who took high academic honours were smaller than those of their less gifted or industrious class mates, we endeavoured to attend to the point. Unfortunately the particulars of degrees were very incomplete; Table XXXIV. contains such available information as might be thought relevant. If women are classified by the average daily period of study no significan-t differences in sizes of family emerge. The basis of this
classification is, h6wever, so unsatisfactory that we personally attach
no importance to it. Our general conclusion is that, in view of the concordance between what our sample reveals anid what Mrs. Sidgwick founid, the onus of proof is absolutely upon those who still assert that the higher education of womnen, in the ordinary sense of that term, diminiishes their physiological fertility. The extent to which effective fer-
tility is reduced by pos-tponement of marriage is shown in the tables.*
A question has been raised with respect to the influence of the husband. We have already seen that both in our small sample and in the larger experience of the Scottish Census Office, the age of husband at nmarriage is not highly correlated with the size of family and that its inclusion in the regression equation does not sensibly increase the accuracy of the prediction deduced therefrom. It might be, however, since like mates with like, that husbands of collegiates differ from those of hoin-collegiates. The only information of statistical value with respect to the husbands which might help to elucidate this matter is the specification of occupations.
Occupations are classified in Table XXXV. which conttasts the occupational distributions of the husbands of collegiate and noncollegiate women. XVe also provide a tabulation of middle and upper class occupations derived from the last four censuses, Table XXXVI.
Our data show that the proportion of husbands who were engaged in teaching, professional or research (luties is significantly larger in the collegiate sample, while the converse is true with respect to commercial occupations. The husbands of the college women also show some excess of clergy and civil servants but not a significant excess.
In Table XXXVII. the mean sizes of family observed when the marriages are grouped by husband's occupation are compared with the predictions of the general aggregate equation (10). Such differences as emerge cannot b considered significant having regard to the probable errors involved.
We have also classified the women themselves by their own occupations after marriage. These Tables, (XXXVIII. and XXXIX), pro-
*In view of post-war conditions and the impoverishment of the middle classes, the delay of marriage due to necessary continuance in gainful occupations introduces a factor the magnitude of which may easilv transcend such differences as those note(l in the text.-M ,G.

t ide other iinformnatioin respectinig limllitationt of fertility to whiclh we shall refer below. Here we note that the observed fertility of women engaged in remunerativ-e occupations is slightly less than that calculated but, bearinig inl mind the probable errors which in almost every casc exceed one third of the differences, w,Ne do not draw any conclusion.
It must also be rememnbered that even had we demonstrated a differenice significaint from the statistical standpoint it would not have followed that difference of occupation caused the difference of fertility. It would have been a case of correlation but not necessarily of causation.
Before passing onl to the topic of restriction we may briefly refer to miscellaneous comparisoins shown in Tables XL. to XLIV. Table XL. shows that there are ino significant differences between the miscarriage anid abortion rates of the two samples. Owing to numerous failures to state the ages of surviving children we could not tabulate infant mortality, the effective numbers of children at risk not being shown. In ainy evenit these matters can be studied elsewhere oIn the basis of far larger numbers and we need not discuss our tiny samples.
The tabulation by nursing capacities, (Table XLI.), brinigs out nio essenitial distinctioni.
The tabulation by state of health after 18 years of age, (XLII.), inidicates a significantly higher proportion of collegiate women returl-
inig themselves as in "excellent" health; but the groups from '"fair" to "bad" do nlot differ appreciably. The aggregate of the "fair to
"bad "differs by 6.18±2.78 in favour of the collegiates. Taking "Excellent." and - Good" together the difference is 7.93±2.84 in favour of the college womeni.
Table XLIII. shows the sizes of family tabulated according to lhealth after 18. Both amongst collegiates and nono-collegiates the groups 'excellent'" to "'good'" show a greater meani family thani the "'fair,'" "poor" aid "'bad.'" Taking ,,excellent" and "good" together, the fertility of the college woomen was 2.03± .06 of the noni-collegiates 2.30±.11. In the combined groups "fair" and "bad," the collegiates' mleani family was 1.51-.11 anid that of the non-collegiates 1.6
±.20. Thc differeinces withini each class are .52±.13 and .69±.23.
Taking collegiates and non-collegiates together, the mean family for "good'' and ''excellent'" is 2.09± .05 and of those in ''fair'' or "bad" health 1.56±.10, a difference of .53±.11. This conmparison is subject to the objection that no allowanice has been nmade for differences in duration of marriage and age at marriage but, as can be seen, when "excellent " and " good " are grouped together anid " fair " " poor " aiid ''bad " placed in another single class of differences the duration and age are too .small to need conisiderationi. Naturally even this does niot completely meet the objection, since the mneanis of the groups nmight be idenitical yet the distributions different. This however, is not a point we can discuss while we have so small a sample, in as much as sub-tabulationl would be nugatory. Table XLIV. shows the sizes of the families of which the collegians were mci-ibers (a similar tabulation of the noncollegians is not provided because anl unascertainiable proportion of these are sisters of collegianis anid could not be assignied to their proper sibships). The mean size of the families of the parental generation is 5.62; the mean size of completed families (sterile marriages excluded,) shown by the Census of Scotland in 1911 was 6.2.

This figure cannot of course be compared with the predicted com-
plete family of the collegians themselves and the table is chiefly of interest with regard to the problem of limitation to which we next
turn. It may also be remarked that we have no knowledge of the (luration of the parents' mnarriages.
Some particulars as to limitation have already beeni given, viz., in
Tables XXXVIII., XXXIX. and XLIV. Table XLV. records the
extent to which attempts at restriction were said to have been made. Among collegians a miniimum of 47.400 and perhaps as many as 62.13%
are ostensibly of limited fertility; the corresponding figures for noncollegians are 39.870o and 54.95o0, the differences are 7.53 j 3.08
and 7.18 ± 3.61, which are insignificant. The tabulationi of mnethods, Table XLVI, calls for Ino remar2' here
since there is no standard of comparison, but we nowN, call attention to
the small proportion of definitely assigne(d methods and the great fre-
quency of v-ague attributions. We shall have more to say uponithis
later oni.
The reasonis for limitationi are tabulate(d in XILVII. anid their pro-
portional frequenicies are almost idcentical in the two groups. It need
hardly be said that the classification is very uncertain because the reasons alleged in the schedules might not be allotted by other analysts to the same classes since they were sometimes ambiguous.
In Table XLVIII. the proportions of " limited" and "'not limited"
marriages are classified by duration with the natural result that the proportion of "limited" marriages increases withl duration. Table
XLIX. compares average sizes of families and brings out the fact that, even when sterile unions are excluded, the "limited" families are neither uniformly nor on the average smnaller than "unlimited" families. It also appears from Table L. that there is no important difference betweeni the partial correlations of size of family and duration (age at nmarriage conistanit), of "limited " and " unlimited'" marriages.
Table XLIV. shows that the sibships of the women "limiting" their fertility are not smaller than those of the others, and Tables XXXVIII. and XXXIX. exlhibit the differences when sterile matings are not excluded. These last mentioned results are of minor importance. The data of XLIV. are far too incomplete to be proper measures of the real fertility of parental stocks, Tables XXXVIII. anid XXXIX. only bring out what would in any event be expected, since pathologically sterile persons would naturally not use artificial means" of limitation so that the whole group of ''unilimited'' marriages has its average fertility redtuced on this accouniit.
Confining attention to fertile unions, it remainis true that we can demonstrate no sensible difference between the size of family in "'limited" and "'unlimited" marriages.
We thought it probable that the result could be explaiined bv supposing that the womeIn wlho were naturally of greater than average fertility resorted in greater proportion to the use of artificial means and consequently emerged with an about average effective fertility. We have failed to obtain any statistical confirmation of this, either by a comparison of fertilities in the first years of marriage, (i .e., at an epochl when preventive measuires would be less commonly uised), or by corre,

lating fertility with restriction for health constan-t. The schedules did not provide for a statement as to wheni restrictive measures were adopted so that ani analysis of fertilities before and after the initroduction of preventive measures could not be made.
It is therefore open to those who believe that the decline of the birth rate is a "biological" phenomenon and little influenced by the popularisation of anti-conceptual methods to claim our results as evidence in favour of their belief. This is not, in our opinion, the true
interpretation. In our table of methods of limitation it will be noticed that " Con-
tinence" is much the largest sub-group. We have made this word cover not only alleged complete abstention from coitus but also its restriction to the period midway between successive mnenstruations. If the reader refers to the Questionnaire reproduced in the appendix, he will note that the interrogatory is "was family intentionally limited?
If so why? and how?" Logically this is exhaustive and should cover restricted inter-
course. But it is to be remembered that on religious grounds many persons distinguish sharply between restriction of coitus and such interference ab extra as involved in the use of pessaries or sheaths. It

is also to be remembered that in current speech artificial limitation
always means some such interference (including here coitus inter-
ruptus). We also feel considerable doubt whether persons whose sexual appetites were almost absent or whose circumstances pre-
cluded them from intercourse would usuallv answer the scheduled
question in the affirmative. Hence it seems to uis probable that a large number of pl ersons who were from the physiological poinlt of view restricting their fertility might bonta fide enter 'Ino' in the
schedule.* We feel therefore very doubtful whether our statistical dichotomv of "'unlimited" ancd "limited'" marriages corresponds to a physical dichotomy. How far these doubts will be shared by others is a matter for the jucdgmenit of our readers; we have no further
evidence to produce.
Lastly we mnay refer to the question whether the probable com-
pleted families of the middle class imothers studied in this in-vestigatioIn are sufliciently large to relplace by natural genierationi the existing
adullts of the miciddle class of wlichl they are samplesO.t Theoretically the solution of this problemii is not (lillicult. If
we know the distribution of marriages, tabulatedl by age of husband( anld age of wife at marriage, we can calculate the niumnber of children likely to be born if we know, (a), the chance of joint survival of husband
and wife, (b), the probability of a birth in each year of marriage. The former cani be derived from a life table, the latter from a regression equationi. Anl applicationi of the method where the English Life tables of 1911 and our equation (10) were utilised led to the coInclusion that, in rounid numbers, 1,000 marriages would produce
3,000 children. This result is, however, inexact. The probabilities of survival furnished by a general life table are not properly appli-
cable to a sample not of the general population but of the educated
middle class and the use of a linear regression equation, which in-
volves the assum)ptioin that equal intervals of time within the fertile
period furnish equal numbers of offspring, is not correct. But evsen if we waived these objections, and they are serious
objections, we have onily solved the easier part of our problem. Suppose that 1,000 marriages do onl the average produce 3,000 children we have now to inquire (a) what proportion of these 3,000 children
will attain puberty and (b) what is the miarriage rate of the miiiddle classes.
It is not a mere questioni of whether the issue of the marriages is sufficient to replace the parents but whether it is sufficient to replace the parents and their coevals who die unmarried. We can solve (a)
to the same degree of approximationi as the first part of the problem,
with the help of a life table, buit we have no data applicable to (b).

*The work of Freud and others makes it probable that an abnormal sexual
life is a commnon starting point of psycho-nieuiroses which are so frequent in ordinary experience; by abnormal is here to be understood not addiction to unnatural vice, but quite frequently an absence of conscious sexual desire due to "unconscious" (leterminants which in many cases can be brought into consciousness bv appropriate analysis. Whether this cause-group is of statistical importanice, cannot yet be determined, but the point is not to be lost sight of.- I.G.

THE FERTILITY OF THE: ENGLISH MAIDDLE CLASSES.

205

When this paper was first drafted, we endeavoured to reach a solution by the method proposed by Dr. E. C. Snow.:
The profound changes of social conditions consequent upoII the war render ainy sulch calculations nugatory and they will not be re-
l)roduced. The impression we formed, that middle class fertility was
perhaps barely sufficicnt to mainitain the absolute numbers of the class provided the fertility rate did niot further decline, may be just, but we
have too little confidence in its exactitude to express a settled opinion
anl(d leave the general problem to be solved by future investigators. F'inally we mnay resume the conclusions which seem fairly
warranted by the evidence here published. In the first place, it is plain that there is no essential difference
betweeii the fertilities of womeni who have and of women who have niot received a univ ersity education. Such differences of effec-
tive fertility as appear can be fully explainied by differences of age
at marriage.
In the second place, it appears that regression equations of the
first degree expressing numnber of chil(dreni in terms of wife's age at
marriage and (luration of marriage graduiate the data with suifficient
accuracy for most purposes. In the third place it is found that the miean size of family is small
and that a considerable proportion of the parents attempt to restrict their fertility.
The sociological implications of these results are left for the discussion of others. Here the personal impression is recorded that the analysis of the sample of middle class families has led to no result incompatible with the conclusions drawn by Professor Karl Pearson anid his collaborators from wider data of a different
kind.
Whether these results, or any results of wider analysis, suggesting that neglect of eugenic principia is leading to a steady deterioration of the race are likely to influence the reproductive habits of the educated classes or social legislation designed to modify those habits, is a question we need not attempt to answer.
