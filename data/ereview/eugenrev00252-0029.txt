earliest Commissions to inquire into of the decline in fertility in Australia since

the decline of the birth-rate (the New South Wales Commission, I903), is now conducting another official investigation into the same subject. This time the inquiry is intended to be nation-wide and is being undertaken not by an ad hoc body appointed for the purpose, but by the National Health and Medical Research Council. An interim report, issued at the end of last year,* gives some indication of the scope and method of
the investigation. The report consists of a general statement
summarizing, and drawing inferences from, a number of special inquiries, the results of which are published as appendices. The special inquiries include a demographic and economic analysis of population trends,t an interim report on a study of certain medical aspects of the fall in the birth-rate-, a summary of the contents of I,400 letters freely written to the Council by women limiting the size of their families and explaining why they are doing so, and a study of the requirements of mothers and children.§
The general report-and, presumably, many of the special studies-are at an interim stage and it is perhaps only fair to reserve judgment on the value of the material until the final report is published. Nevertheless,

i88i. It includes a comprehensive series of reproduction rates from that date to I943. It also provides a new series of estimates
of the future population of Australia. Yet
the demographic analysis is very limited, especially in relation to the comprehensive nature of Australian census and vital statistics. Thus, in projecting the future course of fertility in Australia, it is important to isolate the factors producing the upward trend in fertility since I934, in order to
estimate whether or not these factors are likely to persist after the war. This would
involve an analysis of changes in marriage frequency and their effects upon the proportions of married women with various marriage durations, and a detailed study of the development of marital fertility by age of mother and duration of marriage. Further, any thorough consideration of probable future trends necessitates an examination of changes in family size and distribution. For example, knowledge of trends in the proportions of childless married women of different ages and for various marriage
durations is of great importance in prognosis, as well as for the implementation of a practical population policy. It is to be hoped that any final report will take these questions
into account.
It is difficult to know what value to attach to the letters summarized by J. H. L. Cumpson,* in which individual women explain why they are limiting the size of their families. The invitation issued to the women

Reproduction Rates for the British Empire
Table II summarizes the available reproduction rates for Britain, Eire and the Dominions from I935 onwards. It is hoped, in subsequent issues of the REVIEW, to fill the gaps in this table and to provide more up-to-date rates as the basic data necessary for their calculation become available. Rates for other countries will also be published.
At present it is not possible to interpret the trend of the rates in any comprehensive way. Obviously they represent a significant upward movement in fertility since the mid'thirties. But, equally obviously, it is necessary to make a detailed analysis of the way in which the change has occurred before deciding what it means. The questions raised by the striking rise of the Effective Reproduction Rate for England and Wales to o0 99 in I944 -the highest rate recorded since i922-are

NOTES ON TABLE II
Unless otherwise stated, the N.R.R.s are calculated on the basis of life-tables constructed for the years corresponding with the G.R.R.s.
England and Wales.-The rates are approximate before I939. From I938 to 1940 they are computed from the age-specific fertility rates published by the Registrar-General, and for I941 onwards on the basis of unpublished data supplied by the Registrar-General. Throughout, life-tables have been computed on the basis of the deaths given in relevant issues of the Statistical Review. Rates for 1939 and later years are based on births occurring in each calendar year. For earlier years they are based on births registered in each calendar year. The " E.R.R." (Effective Reproduction Rate), published by the Registrar-General in the Quarterly Return, involves the extrapolation of mortality rates. The E.R.R. is always higher than the N.R.R. and the difference is greatest for years of high actual mortality.
Scotland.-The rates, which are approximate before 1939, are based upon the statistics given in the relevant issues of the annual Review, and upon unpublished statistics supplied by the Registrar-General.
Irish Free State.-The rates are approximate. For I935-7, see Glass, Population Movements and Policies, Oxford, 1940, P. 4I9. The rates for 1940-2 are based on the births reported in the Annual Report of the Registrar-General (Eire) for I943 and the female population and life-table (I940-2) given in the Statistical Abstract (Eire) for 1944,
pp. 23-4.
Canada.-The rates for Canada, corrected for under-registration of births, are from a Bulletin issued by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics (Ottawa), entitled Gross and Net Reproduction Rates;, Canada and Provinces,
1920-42 (N.D.).
South Africa.-For I936, see Glass, South African Journal of Economics, March 1939, P. 45. For subsequent
years the G.R.R.s are from the Statistical Year-Book of the League of Nations, I94I-2, while the mortality data in that publication have been used for constructing life-tables for each year.
Australia.-The rates are from Coombs, Wilson and Carver, in Report of the National Health and Medical Research Council (Commonwealth of Australia), i8th Session, 1944, P. I9.
New Zealand.-For 1935-6, see Glass, EUGENICS REVIEW, 35, Nos. 3 and 4, p. 83. For I937-41, the rates are based on the births and deaths given in the relevant Annual Report on the Vital Statistics of New Zealand, and from estimated populations given in the relevant Statistical Report on Population and Buildings. The latter reports also contain reproduction rates (including the G.R.R. for I942 given in the above table), but they are based on a life-table for 1934-8, while the present N.R.R.s use life-tables for each year. Rates for New Zealand are slightly too high, since the births almost certainly include some attributable to the Maoris.

CURRENT NOTES ON POPULATION TRENDS IN THE BRITISH EMPIRE 69

computed was about 3 -36 and the net rate about 2- 24. For I940-2 the gross reproduction rate was about 3*5. These rates are extremely high. The only comparable recorded gross reproduction rates for Europeans (apart from seventeenth century French Canada) are those for European Russia and for the Ukraine in I896-7, namely 3 44 and 3 65 respectively. So far as mortality is concerned, an abridged female life-table constructed on the basis of the unadjusted data for I935-7 shows a situation comparable with Bulgaria in I900-5.
However, in interpreting the above rates, it must be remembered that there is underregistration of Maori births and deaths. Taking the period I926-36, for which the census data are probably the most reliable, the recorded excess of births over deaths was I2,566. But, even allowing for net immigration in the period (only 69, according to the I936 census), the intercensal increase was almost I8,600.* What apparently happens, according to the Census Department, is not that Maori births and deaths fail entirely to be registered, but that they are in part registered amon gthe European vital statistics. The New Zealand Official
Year Book for I944 states (p. 4I): " For
population purposes, half-castes and persons between half and full blood rank as Maoris; but it is not always possible to ensure that this practice is followed in the registration of births (and of deaths)."t
The published vital statistics of the Maoris are not given in sufficient detail to make it possible to estimate the respective deficiencies of birth and death registration. But the fact that, on the basis of the 23,702 recorded births and II,36 recorded deaths in the period I926-36, the calculated population growth was too low by about 6,ooo persons, indicates a very substantial deficiency in birth registration, and suggests
* Vol. III, Maori Census, Wellington, 1940, p. iii.
t The 1936 census Report states that, for the New Zealand population as a whole (including Maoris), the growth of population " between the censuses of I926
and 1936 was almost exactly equal to the total recorded excess of births over deaths plus the excess recorded for persons arriving from overseas over those departing overseas."

that the gross reproduction rate in I935-7 might, in reality, be significantly higher than that estimated on the basis of the registered
births. On the other hand, it is likely that Maori
registration has improved since i926, and that, therefore, the bulk of the deficiency should be attributed to the earlier part of the intercensal period. This view is supported by an examination of the available statistics. Using uncorrected births, the gross reproduction rate for I925-7 is about 2*o. Yet a scrutiny of the census data for I926 and 1936 indicates that the ratio of children under 5 to women aged 15 to 49 years was substantially the same for both years, being only about 6 per cent higher in the latter year. This suggests that registration was markedly more deficient in i926, and that, in fact, fertility in I925-7 was about as high as in I935-7.*
In considering the validity of these vital
rates, it should be remembered that the complexities involved in the process of recording necessarily make the analysis difficult. For example, a half-caste Maori woman, married to a European, would be classified at the
census as a Maori, but when she bears a child it should presumably be registered as
European. Conversely, a European woman, married to a pure-bred Maori, would be classified as European at the census, but her children should presumably be registered as Maori. Thus, even with accurate and comprehensive census and vital statistics the calculation of fertility rates for Maoris would involve a number of problems. The situation is further complicated by the fact that neither census nor vital statistics concern themselves with these aspects of the question. The census enumerates Maori
* The greater deficiency is clearly shown by the following facts. In I925, registered female births amounted to only 8oo, whereas girls under I enumerated at the census on April 20th, 1926, amounted to 1,013. For I935-6 the figures were 1,492 female births and 1,369 girls under i year of age. (Defective enumeration of this particular age group would not affect this inference, unless-as seems most unlikely-the deficiency were greater in 1936 than in 1926.) Approximate G.R.R.s based on children aged o-4 years (instead of births) suggest a fertility higher by only about 2 per cent in 1936 than in I926-in other words not significantly different.
