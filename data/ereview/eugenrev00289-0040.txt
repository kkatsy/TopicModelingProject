OBJECTS OF PRE-NUPTIAL EXAMINATION
Though the schedule has been devised by the Eugenics Society, it is not intended solely to serve the purpose of preventing dysgenic marnages or of checking the fertility of undesirable stocks. It has the further aim of improving the prospects of the marriage in various ways which are described in the leaflet. Its object is not only to serve the interests of the race; it is also intended to promote the happiness of marriage.

sciously, have later come to wish that they could escape this commitment. In such cases, symptoms of past diseases may be
magnified or even invented. Most doctors have had experience of the neurotic person who develops ailments which serve the pur-
pose of postponing a marriage which is not really desired. The patient says that he does
not want to get married until he is entirely
well, and with the passage of time it becomes clear that he is not going to get well. A man has been known to ask to be examined and draw attention to some real or imaginary
disability in order to get out of an action for breach of promise.
These are the commonest reasons for which a pre-nuptial health examination is sought.
The doctor will generally find it easy to discover the motive, and it is desirable that
he should do so.

It is obvious that no opinion on the pro-
spective success of a marriage is infallible, however searching the questions asked, or however thorough the physical examination. Doctors will be well advised to emphasize this point when communicating opinions to applicants. This holds especially of genetic forecasts. Except in a very small number of cases no certainty attaches to these. The most that can be given is an estimate of
probability. When marriage is keenly desired, the
responsibilities of giving an opinion that one of the partners is unfit for marriage are
obvious. In these circumstances, an opinion unfavourable to the marriage is likely to be
resented and ignored. There is nothing to
prevent the disappointed applicants from repairing to another doctor with standards which they hope will be less strict; or a
