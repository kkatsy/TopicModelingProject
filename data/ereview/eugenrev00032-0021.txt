families increases at a much slower rate after the first generation.
The medical study of my correspondence will be of interest. My correspondents were often able to explain a failure to have children or the low survival and fertility rates in their families in medical terms. Insanity, blindness, tuberculosis, cancer, epilepsy, diabetes, pyloric stenosis, heart disease, intersexuality, and in women, acute dysmenorrhoea, toxaemia of pregnancy, miscarriage and difficult parturition, were quoted.
In addition to such defined or definable medical conditions it is clear that many undefined conditions, which are not usually regarded as the object of medical study, play a part. Such are the admitted absence of sexual desire, or delay in marriage, or marrying a partner much older than oneself. These conditions most contribute to the loss of fertility if they are, as they seem to be, unduly frequent in the offspring of cousin marriages. For the first time such conditions are seen as being genetically determined. For in the environment there is nothing peculiar to the progeny of cousin marriages in outbred populations. What is peculiar is solely in their genetic condition. Whether that condition is to be described in terms of Mendelian recessives or polygenic systems need not concern us at this stage.
The Double Marriage Test
In the course of my correspondence I learnt of one crucial type of test for giving results of the greatest statistical efficiency. It is the use of a double marriage test. A man or a woman of an outbred community marries two spouses, one a cousin, the other unrelated. There are several children by each marriage. From these children complete families of grandchildren are available. I now have five such instances all tending to show a reduction in the numbers of descendants of the inbred marriage as compared with the outbred. I will quote two examples: the best known, that of Johann Sebastian Bach; the most emphatic, that of Lord Henley.
I should be grateful to any correspondent who could inform me of other complete and authentic examples of this situation. Another three or four instances might well be decisive for they represent in every respect what an experimental

breeder would require if he were experimenting with human genetics.

From the way I have stated the problem of cousin marriage it will be seen that it is closely related to another problem: do the progenies of exceptional outbreeding also show a reduction of fertility? We know hardly any more about this question than T. H. Huxley did when he discussed it in 1865. It is usually said that crosses between different races of men suffer from no reduction of fertility. I do not believe it. My experience suggests that the parts of every population are adapted to one another and to the breeding system they have followed; every change in that system upsets the regularity of the result. But at present I see no easy way of discovering the evidence from race-crossing in man.
