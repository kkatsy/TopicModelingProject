Reports of the International Congress of
Eugenics held at New York in Sept., 19i2 I.
To review the official publications of the International Congress
of Eugenics is an almost impossible task, simply because they contain such a mass of information. If anyone either now or a hundred years hence should desire to know where Eugenics stood in 1921 he could not do better than study these four publications. There is no aspect of Eugenics which he will not there find discussed, often from several points of view, and a true picture of expert opinion on various genetic problems is thus well presented. To any of our country men who attended the congress these volumes will be especially welcome, because they recall such unbounded hospitality and so many pleasant gatherings. It is only those who were present who can form any estimate whatever of the good effects of this congress, effects which I am convinced will be widespread and lasting. It served as a starting point for fresh eugenic efforts in America, from which very important results may be anticipated and it gave a definite impulse to the International
movement.
The first publication is a pamphlet giving a report of the proceedings of the Congress, thus giving us much important information. Here the President of the Congress, Professor Fairfield Osborn, is seen at its opening shakinig hands with the President of the Eugenics Education Society. What were the words which were then being uttered is not recorded. Had the picture been taken at the end of the Congress we might hav-e felt certain that Major Darwin was telling him how much it owed to his powerful, effectual, and stimulating influence. The Congress could not possibly have been the success it was without his personal backing and without his permission to hold its meetings in the American Museum of Natural History. No doubt he would be the first to recognise the loyal help which he its President received from all who took part in its organization and management. It is invidious to mention names yet it is impossible to refrain from placing on record the debt which Eugenics owe to Mr. Madison Grant the Treasurer, to Dr. Little the General Secretary, to Dr. Laughlin, Chairman of the Exhibits Committee, and to Dr. Davenport, Chairman of the Publications Committee.
Here we are reminded that the first step which was taken in connection with this Congress was the acceptance by the Permanent International Eugenics Committee at a meeting held at the Rooms of the Royal Society in October 1919, of an invitation received fr m America to hold the Congress in New York. Here also it is placed on record how the international committee, henceforth to be called a Commission, was re-constituted in New York in 1921, how new rules for its organisation were adopted, and how Major Darwin was appointed as its chairman. Details of the expenditure on the Congress are also given, which will be very useful for future reference.
"Eugenics, Genetics, and the Family" i, the title of the first of the two large volumes in which the proceedings of the Congress are

recorded. Here it is that the Reviewer begins to tremble; for it contains 53 separate papers. As compared with the Congress held in London, one fact is especially noticeable, and that is the number of papers on definitely genetic subjects. This hearty co-operation between Geneticists and Eugenists is a most hopeful sign for the future. The American organizers were especially generous in their allocation
of time to their foreign visitors; with the result that two of the longest papers in this volume are "Genetique et Adaptation," by Dr. L. Cuenot, and "The Consequences of War and the Birth Rate in France, " by Dr. Lucien AMarch. Amongst the well known American contri-
butors are the following:-Dr. Davenport, Dr. Jennings, Dr. Shull,
Dr. Loeb, Dr. Little, Dr. F. A. Woods, Dr. R. H. Johnson and many
others.
"Eugenics in Race and State," is the title of the second large
volume, which opens with an excellent portrait of Professor Osborn. Here again amongst the longest papers are to be found "La Race chez les populations Melangees," by G. V. de Lapouge, and "Harmonic and Disharmonic Racecrossings," by Dr. Mjoen. Considering that this volume contains over 50 papers, a generous amount of space is allotted to British contributors even when they, to their great regret, found it impossible to be present. Before such a mass of detail a single reviewer must succumb; though it is to be hoped that some of the articles will be discussed in detail by experts. Amongst the names of prominent contributors are Prof. W. McDougall, Dr. F. L. Hoffman, Dr. Salaman, Sir Bernard Mallet, Dr. R. Pearl, Vice-Chancellor Adami, Dr. Tredgold, Mr. Popenoe, Prof. Ruzicka and many others.
The fourth publicatioin somewhat smaller than the two last mentioned volumes, deals with "The Second International Exhibition of Eugenics," and is of great value as an indication of how a racial exhibition should be organised. Certainly one of those who was present at the Congress felt a keen regret that the time available made
it impossible for him to thoroughly study all the wealth of material exposed for view at the exhibition; for no one could fail to profit greatly by such a study. The volume conicludes with a large number of photographs of the exhibits, which are certain to have a stimulating effect on exhibition commiittees at many an international congress in the future. Eugenists are sometimes tempted to overlook the fact that environments pass on their beneficial effects to posterity by a kind of heredity of their own, and hence we may be sure that the seed sown in New York will spring up in many distant cities without those concerned in the least realising from whence they have drawn many of their inspirations. The New York Committee were certainly not out to win gratitude but merely to spread Eugenic knowledge in all directions and no one who was present can doubt that their success has been very great.
