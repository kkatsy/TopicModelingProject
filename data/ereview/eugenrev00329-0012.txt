GENIUS AS A BIOLOGICAL
PROBLEM.
BY Dr. JoN. A. MJ6iLN.
Why does the great genius disappear in the next generation? The answer is: because everv child has two parents. Every child has two parents belonging to two families, two stocks, and we do not inherit the qualities of our parents, but those of the stock. When father and son very often resemble each other, it is because -the son
belongs to the same stock, about 50% to the stock of the father, and 50% to another stock with which the father-biologically-has no
contact whatever; that is to say, in the society of to-day, where marriage within the same stock is an exception. When the royal dynasties of Peru and the royal dynasties of Egypt at certain periods married within their own stocks-brother and sister marriages-we read that great intelligence or genius was kept up through many generations. It seemed as if great ability only ceased to appear, when the brother had no sister to marry. We do not recommend brother and

sister marriages, but we do recommend the genius to marry into good stock. When Goethe and Napoleon took so little care of the fundamental laws governing the building up of the next generation, that they chose a woman like Christiane, or a stock like that of Marie Louise, we are not allowed to expect a second Goethe or a second Napoleon in the next generation; we are not allowed to be surprised that Goethe' s son August, and his two grand-sons Wolfgang and Wilhelm led an
unhappy life, "im Schatten der Titanen." As stated above, every child has two parents belonging to two
stocks, and we do not reckoni only with the one and completely neglect
the other unpunished. But when the genius ,Johann Sebastiani Bach married within hiis
owIn stock (second cousin) and later into another congenial stock, we
find that the great ability does not disappear.
In the Wedgewood-Darwin-Galton family the cousin marriages are frequent-the number of great talents too. But, what seems to be of much more importance, is the fact that we hardly find one
member in this family who is not above average as regards mental
ability and character. If we could succeed in isolating a single psychic quality from the
great complex of qualities represented by homo sapiens, no matter what
might be the signiificance of the quality itself for the individual, for the race and for the community, and could establish exactly and verify its occurrence in the different members of families throughout several generations, the results of such investigations might have far-reaching consequences for the understanding of the heredito-psychological problems in particular and the elucidation of the laws of heredity in genieral . I
Although the rep)eated occurrence of eniinent talenits in fanmilies points to the conditioned inheritanice of musical ability, it gives but little informnation as to the conditions of heredity and the manner of inheritance. In order to get art insight into the problems of inheritanice it is necessary to consider also the mean variations of
musical ability. Musical ability is the product of several (ualities. Its inature
and degree is different in every individual. If we regard musical ability as a unit, then the individual divergences are mainily of a quantitative natiure. These quantitative divergences in musical ability form within a sufficiently large group of any population a continuous series of variations from the lowest to the highest degree of musical endowment. There exists no sharply defined dividing line between "musical" and "unmusical." Therefore these terms are just as inapplicable as a psychological standard-measure in genealogical and statistical investigations as the terms "tall" and "short" would be in an anthropological research on stature.

As a psychological standard measure of musical ability we have in our laboratory adopted a graded musical index from 0 to 10. This graded musical index can be set up either on the basis of subjective observations or of objective examination (measurement). An index expressed in numbers will always, even if it is based upon subjective judgment, be a far more accurate expression of a person's musical ability than any descriptive epithet can ever be.

For the purpose of getting an idea of the distribution of the individual variations in families, we will at first classify the individuals in two classes, namely: positive-all individuals with the musical
indices from to 6 l-and negative-individuals with the indices from O to 5. We have in the following chosen some characteristic pedigreetypes.

It strikes one at once that there exist families so uniform in their musical powers, that it seems as if one generation is not only a recapitulation of the preceeding one, but even that a certain inequality, which might have been discernible in the ancestors, has disappeared and given place to a homogeneous blend.
In fig. 6 we see how a "musical" strain meets with an "unmusical" strain.

From these genealogical records it has been possible to establish that the hereditary aptitudes mean much more than external influences.
Genealogical records are, however, not sufficient to give a real insight into the manner of inheritance. This has to be obtained through
geneo-statistical investigation, where the investigations of different families are summed up and treated by statistical methods.

In the following pages some results of such geneo-statistical investigations are shown. The musical abilities of the members of 114
families have been recorded on the basis of measurements, each individual being graded from 0 to 10.

In order to give a clear illustration of the relation of the abilities of the children to those of the parents, the individuals have been classi-
fied in three classes: "Superior" (8, 9, & 10), )"'Musical" (3, 4, 5,
6 & 7) and "Poor" (0, 1, & 2). According to this classification 6 groups of marriage-types can be established, namely: S x S, S x M, (or M x S), S x P (or P x S), M x M, M x P (or P x M) and P x P.

The results of these investigations show: The higher the average talent of the parents, the higher is the average talent of the children. In our material "very talented" parents (8, 9, & 10) have no "untalented" children (0, 1 & 2), and "untalented" parents no "very talented" children.
The endowment of the parents is, however, not always sufficient to explain the endowment of the children. We all_know families

where no correlation seems to exist between the mental or physical traits of parents and offspring, and we often meet with results that a4 widely divergent from those obtained from geneo-statistical investigations. Thus we find in some families that the average for the children is very much higher than for the parents, while in other families we can observe an excessive decline of the children's average from that of the parents.
Fig. 9 gives a striking illustration to the fact that we do not inherit from our parents.
Here we see in the first place that the grand-parents are both equally or almost equally talented. Also their collaterals (4 and 5). The four children of the Fl generation show uniform talent, each with the figure 5. Let us first take the two in the middle: the son marries a 2, the daughter actually a 0, as regards musical talent. The result in the F2 generation lies at about the average for the parents, the one couple has a child with index 3, the other couple two children with 2 and 4. But it will now be interesting to note the fate of the musical endowment of the eldest and the youngest children of the Fl generation: Both of them married equally talented men. Nevertheless, the four children of the younger sister have an index-average of only 3.75 whilst the eldest sister' s 7 children have an average of 7.7 with one of 10 (musical optimum), two 9 and one 8. The explanation lies in the average-indices of the collaterals of the equally talented husbands: on the one side 7, on the other only 3. The eldest sister of the FL generation married into an equally talented stock, an equal heritage, or even somewhat above, the youngest married an equally talented individual with materially inferior hereditary endowments. Or in other words: the crossing in the case of the elder sister was congenial as regards musical endowment, in case of the younger sister it was not so, although the individual talents of the two husbands were equal. The younger sister sinned against the old proverb from Western Norway: "You must not marry a maid who iv the only fino maid of her breed."
It is in other words the quality of the stocks rather than the quality of the parents, which determines the abilities of the children.
In the III generation in fig. 10 we find 7 brothers and sisters all being extraordinarily talented. The father himself and his family were all "musical" though not much above average. The mother, however, was a well known European concert-player, and it seemed very natural to see herein the explanation of the appearance of the 7 eminent musicians. But according to the results mentioned above we do not inherit from the individual, but from the whole stock, and we therefore expect to find that the family of the mother is constituted of highly gifted, or at least very musical members. To our surprise we found that all the members of the mother' s family were "unmusical" i.e., much beneath average. According to our experiences this is an impossibility. For a long time this extraordinary case was a mysterious problem, until one day the enigmatic veil was lifted by a member of the family with the words: "I do not see why you should not know what so many relatives and friends are acquainted

with. She (the European concert-player, II, 4, fig. 10) was an illegitimate child. Her real father was a great musician, belonging to a family of artists!"
As a result of our investigations we have found two categories for -the explanation of the musical endowment of the offspring:
1. Children whose abilities can be explained by the abilities of the parents alone.
2. Children whose abilities can not be explained by the abilities of the parents, but by the abilities of the "collaterals."

254 EUGENICS REVIEW.
But we find also a third category in our genealogical investigations, where neither the parents nor the collaterals appear to explain the endowment of a child. Investigations on the families of personseof eminent talent or of genius exemplify this observation.
In order to get an insight into this problem, it is not enough to regard musical ability as a unit quality.
Musical ability is a product of several separate qualities. The nature and degree of musical ability is determined by the more or less pronounced character of these separate qualities. In order to make clear the manner of inheritance of musical ability, it is necessary toV examine the separate components, their relations and their significance, both psychologically and biologically.
An analysis of musical ability in its separate components or basic qualities presents, as may be understood, great difficulties. There are, it is true, some qualities, above all the most elementary qualities of sense of tone, which we with approximate certainty may regard as basic qualities. But the further we penetrate into the more purely musical field, the more difficult it becomes to distinguish the different qualities from each other, and to define them as basic qualities. Ourfirst task is therefore to isolate the separate capacities, which we can distinguish in the perception, understanding and application of musical tone-pictures, and to examine them as regards their heredity, without considering whether in the individual case we have to do with a basic quality or not.
Firstly therefore we have measured the following acoustic-musical and musical capacities by means of psychotechnical methodsl:
1. Discrimination of pitch. 2. Discrimination of intensity. 8. Discrimination of time. 4. Discrimination of tone-interval. 5. Determination of pitch. 6. Toital memory. 7. Determination of interval. 8. Determination of tone-purity. 9. Tune-memory. 10. Discrimination of key (Major and minor). 11. Discrimination of consonance and dissonance. 12. Analysis of tone-complexes. 18. Discrimination of harmonies. 14. Musical imagination. 15. Rhythmic memory. 16. Discrimination of species of time. 17. Reproduction of tunes. 18. Singing of a "second" part. 19. Determination of absolute pitch (qualitative). 20. Emotional musical reaction.
The methods for measuring these different musical abilities, and the recent results of our investigations on analysis of hereditary musical faculty will be brought out in another article.
It is not impossible, that these investigations will throw some new light upon very intimate reciprocity between the biological and the psychological side of music and upon the origin of the abilities and talents in general.
In order to explain the biological appearance of eminent ability, it is not sufficient to work with average values and quantitative investigations. Even if the basic qualities, which constitute

eminent ability are of a higher quantitative value than in other indivi-
duals, nevertheless these quantitative divergences in basic qualities are not sufficient to explain the divergences in the psychological ability as a whole. Further investigations made on cases of eminent musical talents or even genius, show that the latter in regard to basic qualities, very often are much below the optimum for these qualities.
The explanation must lie in the fact that the nature of a quality will change under the influence of other qualities. For instance, the yellow of a book will not change very much if we place the book on a blue carpet. We perceive the two qualities separately as yellow and blue, according to the quantitative degree of the two components. But if we mix the two qualities blue and yellow on a painters palette, we at once get quite a new quality-green-and, what is of great importance, this new quality is to a certain degree independent of the quantity of the two components.
Such a theoretical scheme might illustrate how the same quality f.i. music-combined with other qualities-f.i. imagination or voicenotonlywillchange its phenotypical appearance, but even that the combined traits (illustrated by such a colour-mixture), will reach a degree of development, which in relation to the possibilities for development of each of the single traits isolated, might become unduly high.
As Fig. 11 shows, it is the combination of the traits available more than the quantitative degree of the single quality, which determines the genesis of eminent ability.
A peasant in Valdres (fig. 11, Gen. I, 1.) known in the parish for his many ideas and plans, and for his restless temperament. He was successful in nothing. His son (Gen. II. 8) went to Oslo, where he intended to become an artist and where he tried "everything possible." He ruined himself financially, and also his relatives, with his fantastic impossible projects. Finally he became a decorative painter. His first wife was of a musical family, which, however, had not succeeded in gaining distinction (want of imagination?). From this marriage, however, where a restless fantasy is coupled with solid musical faculty, three highly gifted children sprang, one of them being the most talented composer in the North, Rikard Nordraak, who died at the age of 24. Fortunately for us biologists, the father married for the second time an "unmusical" lady of "unmusical" family. Of their four children only one was above average. And the two groups from the two marriages demonstrate most convincingly the importance of the choice of the partner. From the same source of imagination (Nordraak) there arose through conjunction with intelligence and energy (Peder Bjornson)
the poetic genius Bj6rnstjerne Bj6rnson. (Fig. 11-III, 1.)
SUMMARY.
The nature and degree of musical ability is different in each individual according to the more or less pronounced character of the different component faculties. The divergences in musical ability form within a sufficiently large group of the population a continuous series of variations from the lowest to the highest grade of musical endowment.

The accumulative occurrence of musical talent in families speaks for the heredity of the factors determining musical ability, but gives little information as to the conditions of heredity and the manner of inheritance.
An insight into the conditions of heredity can only be obtained by subjective and objective measurements of the family members in two or three generations and examining the results as regards the single family as well as the whole geneo-statistical material.
Our first geneo-statistical result shows that the higher the average talent of the parents, the higher is the average talent of the children.
By considering the distribution of talents within the single family we often meet with results that are widely divergent from those obtained from geneo-statistical investigations. We find for instance that the endowment of the parents is not always sufficient to explain the endowment of the children. Thus we find in some families that the average for the children stands much higher than for the parents, whilst in other families we can observe an excessive decline of the children's average from that of the parents, An explanation of this
is found in considering the collaterals,
It is the quality of the stocks more than the quality of the parents which determines the ability of the children.
Thus the biological appearance of eminent ability can be
explained:
1. By the ability of the parents. 2. By the ability of the stocks. 3. By the combination of congenital traits.
