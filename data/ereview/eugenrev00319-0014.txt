SURVEY OF BIRTH-RATES OF THE
WORLD.*
By H. W. METHORST.
Among the questions which arise, when one studies the problem of population, there is certainly one which seems to have a very special interest, namely this one: "Is it possible for a nation at any moment to adopt a policy which promotes either a more rapid increase or a greater decrease of its birth-rate ?" -In other words: "Is man capable of exercising a direct influence on these phenomena?"-Or do these phenomena depend mainly upon the social, economic, religious and hygienic conditions under which a population lives?
Whereas we are undoubtedly able, be it to a limited extent, to help to improve our social, moral and mental relations, it is not to be denied that these, in their turn, are closely related to the stage reached by the evolution at any given moment. This evolution, however, is the result of a mental development which extends over thousands and thousands of years and continues with a primeval force which we can hardly guage and in which during a life time we can scarcely bring about any change.
For this reason it seems to me that a study in each country of its social, economic, religious, cultural and hygienic conditions and of the changes occurring in the demographic phenomena is of great importance, in order that we may derive from them the stage of the evolution, as well as the likely trend of the death and birth curves in the near future.
Some countries find themselves in this respect in a curious transition .
Let us, by way of illustrating this opinion, take a bird's eye view of the birth and death curves for a number of years in Holland and some other countries.
In Holland the death rate varies greatly in the years 1840-1870, showing in some years high tops owing to deaths caused by cholera, rneasles, small pox, and influenza. After 1870, i.e., after the introduction of measures for the prevention of infectious diseases (Act of 4 December, 1872), these high peaks have disappeared altogether, and we only notice a rather considerable increase in the year 1918 on account of the then prevalent influenza. After that the decrease continues regularly till it shows less than ten deaths per 1,000 inhabi-

tants in 1926. The birth curve, on the other hand, rises first till 1876, but falls rather rapidly till 1919. After a rise in 1920, probably caused by the return of the mobilized troops to their homes, the fall continues regularly.

In Belgium we notice about the same pfienomenon. There too the death rate falls rather rapidly after 1871, to rise again in 1918, partly
owing to the influenza epidemic, but also to the war, although the deceased soldiers are not included in the death rate.
The birth curve rises till 1876, after which it falls rapidly, especially after 1900, just as in Holland. After the war the birth curve rises till 1920, but then goes on falling again.

In Germany we see almost the same phenomenon as in Belgium. After 1870 the death rate falls, rising again in the years of the great war. The dead soldiers are included in the death rate. The birth curve rises till 1876, then falls rapidly, especially after 1900. After the war the birth curve rises again till 1920, but then goes on falling regularly.

Contrary to the preceding countries, we find here the lower tops of the death curve in earlier.years. The regular death rate commences already after 1860, which is ten years earlier than in Holland, Belgium, and Germany, nor is the top in the year 1918 particularly high. The soldiers are not included in the numbers. The birth curve rises, as in the other countries till 1876, then falls. After the war England equally attains her highest birth rate in 1920, after which the fall comes rapidly. The influence of the war is not felt so strongly as in Belgium and Germany.

Here we find high peaks in the death curve before 1870, as the result of small pox and war. After 1865 the fall begins already, however, and continues especially after 1900 very regularly, without even being interrupted by the influenza epidemic -in 1918, a remarkable phenomenon which is not met with in any other country. The birth curve reaches its maximum as early as 1859, after which there is a fall till 1869, and then a rise till 1884. It is only after this that a regular fall sets in, only interrupted by a rise in 1920, after which the fall continues.

The birth curve rises till 1860, after which it rises and falls alternately, till after 1875 it falls regularly, with the exception of a rise in 1920, as we noticed in other countries too.

In Italy the death curve begins to fall as early as the year 1863.

In 1918 the year of the prevalent influenza epidemic, this country

attains a very high death rate, viz., 33 per 1,000; we do not know,

however, whether the soldiers are partly included in this figure.

The birth rate too falls from 1863, but maintains till 1915 a high level

of over 30 per 1,000. In 1918 the birth rate falls suddenlydownto

18, to rise again in 1920 as much as over 30. After that the fall con-

tinues regularly.

Previously to 1870 a few tops are found in the mortality curve

as the result of cholera. The highest top is shown by the war of 1870.

After that the death rate falls, it is true, but not so much as in other

countries. The great war and the epidemic of influenza cause the

death rate to rise rapidly in 1918; the soldiers are included in the

figures.

Whereas in most countries the fall of the death rate continues

regularly after 1920, we notice in France, in the last few years, rather

a slight rise in the death rate.

The birth curve has fallen in France since 1820. In the latest war this figure has fallen to 9 per 1,000; after that it has risen considerably, thus causing France in the last two years to have a higher birth rate than Switzerland, Esthonia, England, Sweden and Saxony.

In Australia we find a regular falling of the death rate since 1875, slightly interrupted in 1919 by the influenza epidemic. We do not know whether the soldiers are included in the death rate. Since 1860 the birth rate has fallen rather regularly and-rapidly.

New Zealand. Probably as the result of favourable age conditions, the death
rate has always been low. It was highest in 1918 on account of the influenza epidemic, higher than in the period of 1861-1870, when the death rate was 1382 per 1,000 inhabitants. In 1925 the death rate fell to 8-3; this is the lowest figure ever attained by any country.
The relative birth rate was highest in the period of 1871-1880, viz., 40 * 7 per 1,000 inhabitants, when New Zealand had only 400,000 inhabitantas. Now that this country has 1,300,000 inhabitants, the birth rate has fallen as low as 21 - 2 per 1,000 inhabitants.
Canada.
The death rate in Quebec is about half of that in Japan, and lower than in France. For the rest of Canada the death rate is as favourable as in Holland.
There is a great difference between the birth rates of the Province of Quebec and the rest of Canada. The birth rates in Quebec are higher after 1911 than in 1900. The French inhabitants especially seem to have a high birth rate. The birth rate is higher in Quebec than in Japan; the general birth rate of Canada is higher than that of Holland.
United States.
The death rate, known since the period of 1876/85, was highest in 1918, at the time of the influenza epidemic, viz., 18 3 per 1,000, followed by the periods of 1886-1895, and 1896-1905. At present the death rate is lower than in Belgium, Prussia, England, Sweden, France, and Japan.
The highest relative birth rate, viz., 25 per 1,000 inhabitants is found in the period of 1906-1915. It now amounts to 23-2 per 1,000 inhabitants, which is lower than in Holland and Japan, but higher than in the other countries mentioned.
If changes in the birth and death rates of various countries are examined we will generally find the following facts.
As long as no particular events cause any disturbing influence, the relative birth rate shows in every country a tendency to increase till a certain maximum is reached, generally not higher than about 40 births per year and per 1,000 inhabitants. Then we notice that the relative death rate is not, as a rule, higher than 30 per year, and per 1,000 inhabitants. But after that, thanks to the successful struggle of man against all that threatens his earthly life, the relative death rate begins to fall, often before the birth rate does. As soon as modern ideas of hygiene, of the care of the newly-born child, of bringing-up, and in connection with these, an increasing sense of responsibility with regard to oneself, and others, dawns on the various social circles, which is only possible when a certain degree of ease and education

exists, the death rate falls, but for the same reasons the birth rate falls too. Whenever these expressions of cultural evolution respond more quickly to the death rate than to the birth rate, this former rate sometimes falls more rapidly than the latter, which may for the time being, cause an alarmingly high birth excess.
This birth excess (difference between the number of births, and the number of deaths per 1,000 of the population) has been examined for 55 countries, as much as possible for the same period, in most cases for the years 1919-1928. Certain countries, such as Guatemala, Russia, Bulgaria, Mexico, Ukraine, the South African Union (white population), and Salvador have a birth surplus of 16 and more per 1,000 inhabitants, whereas large countries, such as India and France are to be found at the bottom of the list, with a surplus of about 3 per 1,000 inhabitants, while Holland occupies the 8th position with a birth surplus of 16.
The birth excess has not in all countries been greatest in the same years.
In Holland it was greatest in the years 1920 and 1921, when it was 16.3 per 1000. In Belgium it has never attained that height. It attained its maximum of 9-8 per 1000 inhabitants in the period of 1891-1910. At present it is 6-9. In Prussia the maximum was 16*3 in 1902, after which it fell to 9-1 in 1925. In England it was greatest in the period of 1871-1880, when it was 14 per 1000. It has now fallen to 6 per 1000. In Denmark its maximum of 14 9 was attained in 1909; it was high too in 1924, viz. 10-6. In Sweden the maximum of 12 *2 occurred in the period of 1871-90; at present it is 5 8. In France the surplus has always been slight since 1811; it was highest in the period of 1821-1830, viz. 5 8. At present it is 1U5. Owing to the high birth rate and the low death rate the surplus in Australia has always been great. It was greatest in the period of 1861-70, viz. 2483; at present it is 1387. In New Zealand it is highest in the period of 1871-80, viz. 28 *4; at present it is 12 9. In Japan it was greatest in the years 1911 and 1913, viz. 13 8; at present it is 12 * 6. In Quebec the birth surplus was greatest in 1921, viz. 23 * 4; in the same year it was 15-7 for the rest of Canada. The United States attained their maximum of 12 - 6 in 1920, whereas it is 10 *8 now.
Seeing that the birth surplus is the difference between the number of births and the number of deaths, it is interesting to examine the order of the 55 countries mentioned, with regard both to births and deaths in these same periods.
Let us now confine ourselves to Holland; we will in the first place see that the relative birth rate has gone down in the years 1840-1847 from 351 to 28 6 per 1,000 inhabitants. In this latter year, owing to various infectious diseases, and the shortage of food on account of a diseased potato crop the death rate was higher than the birth rate (31 1 and 28 - 6 respectively). Then the birth rate goes up again with great fluctuations, till in 1876 it attains its maximum of 37 * 1, followed by a regular, gradual descent till 1919, when it is 24.6. After that, the birth rate goes up rather suddenly for 10 months, as the result of the Armistice (November, 1918), only to be followed by a

A similar drop of the birth rate is to be seen, when we compare the number of births and the number of married women under the age of 50 years, or when we put the number of births per 1,000 inhabitants side by side with the annual number of marriages concluded per 1,000 inhabitants.
The questions to be put concerning any country of which we wish to deal with the population, are the following:
1. When and where did the fall first begin, and for what reasons? 2. Was this fall the result of determined propaganda, or rather
an advance of the standard of living, or the stage reached by evolution? 8. Is it only a temporary fall, or is it inclined to continue ? 4. Is the increase of population likely to continue, or will it stop of its own accord as evolution progresses ?
There are two series of figures which help us to study the evolution of the principal demographic phenomena. The first of these is the increase of the total population from one census to another; the other is the changes in the birth and death rates per 1,000 inhabitants, in connection with the changes in the figures of emigration and immigration.
Increase of population can only take place as the result of an immigration which is greater than emigration, or of a number of births larger than that of deaths. In a country, such as Holland, where on the whole emigration is greater than immigration, although to such a slight degree that the number of people leaving the country has hardly any modifying influence on the increase of population resulting from *our birth rate, the increase of population is naturally for the greater part dependent on the number by which the births per 1,000 inhabitants surpass the deaths per 1,000 inhabitants.

If we continue in this direction with a successful fight against
microbes as indicated by Pasteur, with hygienic advice as regards
prophylactic in its largest sense, which has proved to be efficient and
more economical than the efforts to cure existing diseases or accidents,
then mortality among those older than one year, may surely go down a little further in most of the age groups. But this improvement does in reality only put off death for a little while, i.e., a gradual shifting of those in the lower groups to the higher ones. For this reason the mutual relations of the age groups will undergo a change, causing the highest group to have the densest population. This is.a phenomenon which we perceive in Holland, as well as in other countries, and which will probably be even more pronounced in the future.
The population in any country may be compared to a crowd on a moving staircase. New births are continually added to these numbers, and once landed on the moving staircase they slide on, unless they drop off on the way, till they reach the top, or let us say the unin-
terrupted life time of 100 years. Hygiene can do a great deal. It may promote the sliding on as long as possible of a human creature, but in the end its only effect is a moving on of the individual from a lower into a higher group. These individuals once having reached the highest age group, belong inexorably to the group of the "morituri." Thus it may happen in the case of a decreasing birth rate, that the death rate, as a perfectly logical result of the plain fact that all that is born, must die, is going to exceed the birth rate, without the hygienic or economic conditions having in the slightest measure decreased, nay, rather as the consequence of death having been put off for years through the application of hygiene.
The temporary drop of the death rate as the result of hygiene, causes the increase of population; the sense of responsibility promoted by hygiene causes the birth rate to do down. After having gone down to a certain minimum, the death curve goes up again. Thus the two curves of birth and death are, as it were, predestined to approach each other again, in accordance with a most regular evolution, and the population problem is solved. But this demographic evolution is only possible in case of a steadily developing hygiene, and those who have to perform the glorious task of serving hygiene, naturally help to promote a normal solution of the population problem.
This is the comfort given to those who are interested in this problem. We need only persist in working at the task of civilization which has been put on our shoulders, always endeavouring to enhance the standard of welfare of the entire population, avoiding all that may do harm to the soul of the population and all that hinders an economic evolution, organising national and international co-operation. If we do that, we may confidently meet the future, although there may be moments when the sight of the incomprehensible events which sometimes take place on this earth, make us tremble with anxiety.
Providence has after all laid in the course of events the solution of this very important population problem, which, whenever there is an economic depression, naturally claims our attention more than at other times.
