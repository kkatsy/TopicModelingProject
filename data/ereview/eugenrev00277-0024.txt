'"-r'.HE testing of "intelligence" has
certainly attained an outstanding
I position. In the whole of current
normal psychoogy, nothing can compare
with it either for theotetical novelty or for practical utility. Twenty years ago it might have seemed to.have reached its apogee in
the testing- of00overoo,ooosoldiers of the

Not a little, surprsing, and even disquieting, accordingly, must be the fact that

climax of equivocation seems to have been reached when numerous testers make the term harbour even sensory perception itself,
which onrginally, as we have just seen, was taken to be just the power that intelligence is not. Thus Binet wrote: "A sensation, a perception, are intellectual manifestations." So, too, Haggerty: "intelligence "-. includes " sensation, perception, association, memory, imagination, discnmination, judgement, and
reasoning."
Moreover, not only do the modern leading authors conceive the nature of " intelligence" in wildly discrepant theoretical definitions-; they present no less contradiction in their
actual practice of testing. Thus Binet in his theoretical analysis of memory says that this is not "intelligence " but only the " great simulator" of it. Yet in his actual practice his tests of memory play a very large part.

Even Terman, in spite of his avowed austere

Now, the first and greatest charge made
against the testing of "intelligence" is that
no agreement has been achieved-or seems likely to be-as to what mental power or
powers this name is conceived to comprise. In very ancient times, it was limited quite
definitely to -the power of abstraction as
contrasted in particular. with that of sensory perception. And some 'such scope of the term is sometimes advocated to this day.
Terman, for instance, wrtes with irreproach-

down even to mere sensory discruniination. In view of all this discrepancy, what
information do we really possess when we
are told that a certain child has done badly at the test ? Are we to understand no more than that he is rather weak in abstract
thinking ? Or else, that his deficiency
extends to memory, imagination, association, judgement, and even sensory perception ? To
ignore such equivocations in intelligencetesting-say its critics-is to run the risk of doing the child the gravest injustice.
