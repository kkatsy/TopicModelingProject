NIC PROGNOSIS WITH RESPECT TO MENTAL DEFICIENCY
By L. S. PENROSE, M.D.

ON question for a medical tioner to be asked is whether, the birth of a physically or efective child, the parents are having more children. If the a Mendelian recessive character ents are normal, the answer is pect of another child's having are one in four. Most diseases in ver, in which hereditary causation ed, are not precisely genetical either the mode of inheritance is known or some cases are accien, for example, in the Chances Inheritance,1 it is stated that some t. of the sibs of schizophrenics are schizophrenic, this is a rather plified description, for practical of a complex phenomenon. In the tal defect the position is a little in the case of psychosis, for be recognized quite early in life: , however, the contribution of not easy to determine. er has made extensive calcuestimate the probabilities of the of all types of mental disease tives of patients and in the general His results, based upon a large f empircal data, are somewhat apply in the particular case of ect because of the variety of occurs. Brugger's material,3 in es of defect are separated, could for use in this country if the mental grade were more standarddata collected in my recent y be of service from this point of they consist of a large number selected on account of the presence one defective child.

The most usual form of the eugenic prognosis problem presented to a medical adviser is when parents, both of normal intelligence, have one child who is an imbecile or idiot. The parents ask what risk there is of their having another defective child and the answer can be given in terms of probability based on known sibships. In
the instances where both parents were of normal ability-a few had superior mental capacity-and where the child by which the selection was made was an idiot or imbecile, the figures, which are given in Table I and which form part of Table III, were obtained.

There were 486 sibships of this kind and i,888 sibs of known mental capacity of whom 2'7 per cent., or one in thirty-seven, were of imbecile or idiot grade. The incidence of imbeciles and idiots in the general population was estimated by Lewis5 to be about 0 20 per cent., or one in five hundred. The birth
of an imbecile or idiot to normal parents,
therefore, increases the expectation that a subsequent child will suffer from low grade defect by more than ten times.
The expectation can be more accurately determined if certain other facts are known. The prognosis is slightly improved if there are already normal children in the sibship at the time of enquiry. There is no appreciable difference if the propositus is male or female.

t Normal is defined, throughout, by mental ratio estimated to be 85 or above; Dull by mental ratio of 70 to 84; Simpleton by mental ratio of 50 to 69; Imbecile by mental ratio of 20 to 49; Idiot by mental ratio below 20.

36 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

When birth injury or encephalitis can be diagnosed with certainty, the probability that a second child will be affected is naturally much reduced and approaches the probability in the general population just in so
far as the diagnosis is certain. If the affected child is of the mongolian type, the chance
that a second imbecile or idiot will be born in the family is only about one in fifty: the
chance that the second affected child will be a mongol is less than one in fifty. On the other hand, if parents are consanguineous, the prognosis is worsened for there is a strong likelihood that the condition in the child is recessively determined. In Table II, per-
centage expectations are given which, however, are based on only fourteen families and

forty-nine sibs. It is easily seen how sanguinity in parents affects the progm the probability of an idiot or imbecil4
subsequent children becomes one in
