facts of interest are now available as an outgrowth of a study undertaken for a quite different purpose.f These concern the length of life of 4,736 distinguished men, native to the British Isles between II00 and i8oo, for whom the year of birth and year of death are recorded.
These men assume historical importance as representing native-born eminence in the

commoners alike, they embrace within their numbers the patriot ardent in the struggle for political freedom, the scholar quiet in the solitude of his study, the churchman deep in the controversies of Church and State, the innovator in art, science or mechanics, and men whose claim to distinction would seem to lie in some chance circumstance.
As to their distribution in time, these eminent men are to be envisaged as belonging chiefly to the latter part of the historical period in question. With eighty per cent. actually born during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and the first significant increase in their numbers appearing during the sixteenth, the eighteenth century completes this picture by itself adding a thirtytwo per cent. increase over the representation for the seventeenth century. (Table I.)

As grouped by decennial periods, the unsmoothed percentage frequency polygon for the total sample presents for " length of life " a fairly normal but somewhat positively skewed distribution. With a mode of " seventy to seventy-nine " years and an arithmetic mean of 66 * 3 ± - I2 years, " length of life" shows a dispersion measured by a standard deviation of I4 * 8 + I * O and an actual range of recorded age of from nineteen to II2 years (Table II). Four-fifths of the distinguished men born in the British Isles are seen to have completed a life span of from fifty to eighty-nine years. For each succeeding decennial period there is a percentage increase up to the " seventy to seventy-nine " year group. This is followed by a twelve per cent. reduction for the octogenarians, and an additional fourteen per cent. decrease for the
nonagenarians.

* Louis I. Dublin and A. J. Lotka, Length of Life, 1I936, p. 57.
t This study, now in progress at the University of
California under the direction of Professor F. J. Teggart, is based upon a sampling of the Dictionary of National Biography arrived at by the selection of each third person in the " epitome."

When the century by century distributions of " length of life" are considered, it appears that the mean "length of life " for the great men born in the eighteenth is increased by ten years over that for those born in the thirteenth and fourteenth
