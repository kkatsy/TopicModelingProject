assumed in the estimates is an interesting
example of the effect of changes in the age constitution of women of child-bearing ages upon birth-rates. This matter receives
further attention in the section dealing with the age distribution of the female population. These estimates may be regarded as conservative because vital statistics published
since the computation of these figures show
that, under the stimulus of war-time prosperity, maternity benefits to the dependants of members of the Defence Forces, etc., specific fertility rates during the years I94I to I944 are more than IO per ceint higher than in I936, but it is probable there will be a corresponding decline after the war. If, however, this higher order of fertility were to persist throughout the post-war period
covered- by this article, it is estimated that the total population in I98I would be over
go,ooo persons.

Estimated Age Constitution of the Population On the assumptions already described the
following figures of the age distribution of
the Colony (see Tables III to V) have been
prepared by projecting forward the existing
five-year groups every five years, and utilizing the life table to adjust them for deaths in the intervening years.
During the next forty years the numbers of boys aged I4 and under should gradually increase from 9,129 to II,378, but the trend does not rise steadily, there being a slightly downward movement in the decade I95I to I96I. Increasing the school-leaving age to i6 would involve providing for an additional
500 to 6oo boys from the date at which the
increase took place.
It is noticeable that the dependent population (assumed to be males below I5 and over 60) increases relatively to the earning population, the figures being 36I per I,000
