Changing Patterns of Fertility
in the United States

Clyde V. Kiser

Probably no subject is of more fundamental importance to the future of human
society than that of changing patterns of
fertility. United Nations officials have
pointed out that the fertility level is one of
the best predictors available of the state of
modernization of a country. With but few
exceptions the countries of high fertility are
the “developing” countries, and the countries of low fertility are the well-modernized
countries.

This paper is concerned with three aspects of changing fertility patterns in the
United States: trends in the average levels
of fertility, trends in age at marriage and
child spacing, and trends in the differentials
in fertility.

TRENDS IN AVERAGE LEVELS
OF FERTILITY

As in some other modern countries, the
fertility trends in the United States fall into
three distinct periods—the long period of
declining fertility prior to World War IT, the
wartime and postwar baby boom, and the
resumed declines since 1957.

Fertility was conspicuously high in colonial America. Benjamin Franklin noted this
fact as early as 1755. Thomas Malthus, in
his first edition of Principles of Population,
published in 1798, used the United States as
an example of the capacity for population to
double every 25 years, the approximate

 

average length of a generation at that time.
Students have estimated that during the
colonial period the average woman of completed fertility had borne about 8 children.
The country was largely rural and agricultural and the frontier to the West stimulated
early marriage and large families.

It is not possible to pinpoint the year or
decade of initial decline in fertility. However, ratios of resident white children under
age 5 to white women of childbearing age
(15-44) document the existence of a virtually uninterrupted decline from 1810 to
1930. Only one census, that of 1860, failed to
show a decline of fertility ratio over that of
the preceding census.

The translation of fertility ratios into
crude birth rates, i.e., number of births during a year per 1,000 white population, yields
an estimate of 54 for the year 1810, 43 for
1850, 35 for 1880, and 30 for 1900 (Thompson and Whelpton, 1933). The crude birth
rate for whites adjusted for under-registration was 26.9 in 1920, and it dropped to a
low point of 17.6 in 1933 and 1936 (U.S.
Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare, 1969).!

1Using a different method, Coale and Zelnik
(1963) secured essentially similar results. They estimated the birth rate for whites in the United States
to be about 43 for 1855, 34 for 1880, and 28.5 for
1900. Their estimates yielded 25,0 for 1920, a low of
16.7 for 1933, and 16.9 for 1936.

During the thirties there was much concern about the small family. Pronatalist legislation was the vogue in countries of Western Europe, and it was during this decade
that the Indianapolis Study of Social and
Psychological Factors was initiated in order
to investigate the reasons for the small family in a typical urban center of the United
States. Projecting the currently low and declining fertility rates, leading students of
population projected peak populations for
this country in the sixties and even in the
fifties with declines thereafter. However,
following the low crude birth rate of 1936
there was a gradual recovery. There were
distinct spurts in the early forties arising
partly from increasing marriage rates associated with defense production and the apparent resort to parenthood to avoid the
draft. There followed some declines in the
birth rate during 1942-45 when larger and
larger proportions of young men of prime
military age were sent to European or Far
Eastern war areas.

The rapid demobilization of men following the end of the war in Europe and the Far
East in 1945 brought a spectacular increase
in the marriage rate in 1946 and an equally
marked increase in the birth rate in 1947,
These immediate postwar increases surprised no one, least of all the demographers.
What did surprise everyone, and perhaps especially the demographers, was the persistence of the postwar increases in fertility.
The search for causes of the sustained postwar increases led Whelpton to pioneering
work in cohort fertility analysis (Whelpton,
1954). He was able to demonstrate that
much of the initial postwar increase in fertility was due to eventuation of marriages
previously postponed because of economic
and wartime conditions rather than to increase in size of completed family.

However, the increases lasted longer than
expected, Ryder and others have demonstrated that much of the sustained increase
was due to trends toward earlier marriage
and to decrease in intervals between mar

riage and first birth and between successive
births rather than to increase in completed
size of family. Ryder’s development of techniques for differentiating period and cohort
fertility is one of the methodological gains of
this period (Ryder, 1969).

Nonetheless, there were marked increases
in size of completed family, although there
was no reversion to the large families of 1910
and earlier. The increase was due rather to
declines in proportions of childless and onechild families and to increases in proportions
of families with 2-4 children. In fact, the
popularization of families of this size during
the past twenty years has been one of the
conspicuous patterns of modern fertility
trends. Ryder has stated ‘‘One of the more
interesting and important changes that have
been occurring in American fertility is the
diminution in the dispersion of women
among the various parities. This phenomenon may be directly measured by parity
variance. This parameter has declined from
7.89 for C. 1891-95 to 4.25 for C. 1936-40
...” (Ryder, 1969).

Just as the persistence of the postwar
baby boom was a surprise to demographers,
the decrease in birth rates that has been
under way since 1957 in the United States
and other modern countries has been the
subject of much debate. Here again Ryder’s
work has been helpful in that it indicates
that much of the decrease is due to a cessation or reversal of the trend toward lower
age at marriage and to a cessation of the
decrease in intervals from marriage to first
birth and between successive births, rather
than to actual reduction in size of completed
family.

Again, however, some declines in size of
completed family would result from continuation of current fertility trends. This is
suggested by cohort fertility analysis and by
recent declines in the reported average number of children “expected” by young women
in recent years.

and nonwhite women by number of children
ever born reaching 45-49 years of age at indicated years. The data for years 1885-1910
are from the 1910 census; those for 1905 are
for women 50-54 in 1910; those for 1900 are
for women 55-59, etc. The validity of this
method will be discussed later. The relatively low proportions childless and relatively high proportions with large families
among women completing the childbearing
period prior to 1910 are conspicuous, especially for the Negroes.”

TRENDS IN AGE AT MARRIAGE
AND CHILD SPACING

We have already noted that the trends in
period fertility are resultants of trends in
age at marriage and child spacing and trends
in cohort fertility. Period fertility may be
defined as the average fertility of all birth
cohorts during a specific period such as one
year. Cohort fertility is the cumulative fertility of a given cohort passing through life.
The former focuses on the period; the latter
on the cohort. It is well, however, to consider briefly the trends in age at marriage
and child spacing. Ryder has considered
these two variables to be the components of
what he calls the tempo of fertility. He describes tempo “as a terse designation of the
observed time pattern of marriage rates or
birth rates.” He explains that the words
“ ‘spacing’ and ‘timing’ are more common,
but they are unsatisfactory because they
imply rather more volition than is appropriate for most couples” (Ryder, 1969).

It is common knowledge that the postwar
baby boom was accompanied by a trend toward more marriages, earlier age at marriage, and by reduction in interval between
marriage and first and successive births.
Thus, among women 20-24 years old in the
United States the proportion ever married
(including widowed and divorced) was about
53% in 1940, 68% in 1950, and 72% in 1960.

? Data for censuses prior to 1950 relate to native
white and Negro ever-married women; those for

later censuses relate to white and nonwhite evermarried women.

Changing Fertility Patterns

305

For those 45~49, the proportion ever married was about 91% in 1940, 92% in 1950,
and 93.5% in 1960 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1953, 1961).

Ryder’s total nuptiality rate which he
defined as the proportion of women married
(at least once) by exact age 50 was 91% for
those born during 1901-5, 95% for those
born during 1916-20, and 98% for those
born during 1931-35 and 1936-40, The estimate for those born during 1941-45 dropped
back to 95%, a recent trend in line with the
decline in the birth rate since 1957. For these
same five birth cohorts, the mean ages of
nuptiality were respectively 23.21, 22.73,
21.35, 21.32, and 21.55.

The “mean age of fertility” of women was
26.89 years for the cohort of 1901-5, 27.78
for the cohort of 1916-20, 26.19 for the cohort of 1931-35, 25.94 for the cohort of
1936-40, and 26.42 for the cohort of 194145, Although somewhat irregular, the trend
was generally upward for women born during 1901-1915, downward for those born
during 1916-1940, and upward for those
born since 1940,

A recent report from the Bureau of the
Census stated: “A distinct trend toward
childbearing at an earlier age was observed
for women born between 1910 and 1940, but
this trend is probably not being continued
by women born in the first half of the 1940’s.
The evidence points to a new tendency toward starting childbearing at an older
age. ... Moreover, a distinct trend toward
childbearing sooner after marriage was observed for women who married in the 1940’s
and 1950’s, but this trend is not being continued by white women who entered first
marriages between 1960 and 1964” (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 19693).

TRENDS IN DIFFERENTIALS
IN FERTILITY

During 1950-60 there was an enhancement of fertility differences by color, and
perhaps also by religion. There was a narrowing of fertility differences by region,

306 Kiser

urban-rural residence, and, with some exceptions, by socioeconomic status.

The widening of fertility differences by
color during the decade arose from the more
rapid increases in fertility among nonwhites
than among whites. It seems likely that this
trend has continued since 1960 because the
declines in fertility since 1957 have been
earlier and more pronounced among the
whites than among the nonwhites (Kiser,
Grabill, and Campbell, 1968).

Important qualifications to the above
paragraph are: (a) the white-nonwhite differentials are strongest in the South and
weakest in the Northeast and (8) the whitenonwhite differentials in fertility are strongest in the lowest socioeconomic strata and
weakest in the professional, college-educated, and highest income groups. In fact,
among college-trained wives 25-49 years of
age, fertility rates tend to be lower among
nonwhites than among whites (Kiser and
Frank, 1967).

The sharper increases in fertility among
the nonwhites than among the whites mentioned above probably arose in part from the
improved health conditions among urban
Negroes after World War II. Prior to World
War II, urban Negro marriages were characterized by conspicuously high proportions
of childless couples. The clean-up of venereal
disease probably accounted for the sharp
declines in proportions childless among
young Negro wives.

Despite recent past trends, it seems likely
that the increase in proportions of nonwhite
women completing high school and attending college will result in narrowing of the
fertility differentials by color.

The narrowing of the fertility differences
by region has been due in part to decreasing
regional differences in proportions of the
population living in rural and urban areas
and to decreasing regional differences in the
composition of the population by color.
Part of the high standing of the South with
respect to fertility was due to the relatively
high proportion living in rural areas and the

Social Biology

high proportion of Negroes in its population.
At present, it 1s only because of its relatively high proportion of Negroes that the
South outranks the North Central States
with respect to fertility. Stated in another
manner, regional differences in fertility are
wider for Negroes than for whites.

CHANGING PATTERNS OF FERTILITY
BY SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS

As mentioned above, there is “with some
exceptions” a current trend toward narrowing of fertility differences by socioeconomic
status. One exception is the apparent lack of
such a trend at present among nonwhites.
Another is the suggestion of sharper differentials in 1960 than in 1950 among white married women of youngest ages.

Whatever the present situation regarding
the exceptions may be, there has been for
some time a marked trend toward diminution of the fertility differentials by socioeconomic status among white women in virtually all modern countries.

A frequent theory of the current trend
toward narrowing of differentials is that
such differentials are temporary phenomena
associated with the demographic transition.
The theory is that prior to the demographic
transition the fertility rates for all classes
were fairly uniformly high. The urban women of highest socioeconomic status were the
first to resort to family limitation practices
and hence were the leaders in the trend toward small families. Family planning practices eventually filtered downward through
the socioeconomic classes and outward to
rural areas. The rural women of lowest socioeconomic status, according to this theory,
are the last to accept family planning. This
process would yield first an enlargement and
later a diminution of class differences in fertility.

The available data appear to support the
above-mentioned hypothesis in general respects. Actually, few data are available regarding the trends in fertility rates by socioeconomic status during the early years of the

demographic transition. Fortunately, however, data from the 1910 census on the fertility of women by occupation group of the
husband, are available by age of woman, not
only for women of childbearing age, but also
for those of older ages. Thus, the analysis
can be pushed back to periods preceding
1910,

The case is illustrated by Table 3 and
Figure 1, presenting fertility rates among
women 45-49 observed or imputed for the
years 1885-1965. The data for years 1910,
1940, 1950, and 1960 are those for women
45~49 years old at those census dates. The

‘Certain qualifications regarding the occupational fertility data should be emphasized. The data
based upon the 1910 and 1940 censuses relate to
native white women “married once and husband
present.” Those for 1950 relate to white women

“married once and husband present.”? Those for
later years relate to white women “married and hus

data for the years prior to 1910 were derived
from the 1910 census for women older than
45-49.4 Those for 1920 are for women 65-69
and those for 1930 are for women 55~59 re
band present.” Doubtlessly there were also some
changes in rules concerning the collection, coding,
editing, and tabulation of occupational and fertility
data. However, these inconsistencies probably would
not alter the Jarge aspects of the trends and differentials described.

‘Thus, women 55-59 in 1910 reached 45-49 in
1900; those 65-69 in 1910 reached 45-49 in 1890; and
those 70-74 in 1910 reached 45-49 in 1885. The use
of data for survivors of earlier cohorts of women of
completed fertility raises questions of selectivity of
survivors according to fertility and socioeconomic
status. The two chief studies on this problem were
restricted to survivorship in relation to fertility
among women of completed fertility and yielded
somewhat different results. Freeman (1935) found no
relation of fertility to longevity among women surviving the childbearing period. Dom and McDowell
(1939) found a positive relation, but this was partly
induced by the method in which the categories were
established.

porting in the 1940 census. The data for
1965 are those for women 40-44 in the 1960
census.

The data in Figure 1, plotted on a semilogarithmic chart, suggest a pronounced enhancement of occupational differentials in
size of completed family from 1885 to 1920.
This was due to the earlier and sharper declines among the wives of “white-collar”
men than among wives of craftsmen, laborers, and farmers. Prior to 1910, the declines were especially marked for the wives
of professional men and least for the laborers
and farmers.

The data further suggest a fairly unchanging pattern of differentials from 1920
to 1950. Since 1950 there has been a sharp
contraction of occupational differentials in
size of completed families. This has been due
to earlier and sharper increases in fertility of
the white-collar classes than among the
others.

In Table 4 and Figure 2 the relative variations are shown by expressing the fertility
rate for each occupational class as a per cent
of the base rate’ for the total age group (4549) of the period considered.

The indices in Figure 2 present the changing pattern of relative variations apart from
secular trends in fertility levels. Except for
the farm laborers, the outline of Figure 2 as
delineated by the experiences of the farmers
and professional class is the shape of a Chinese lantern lying on its side.§ In 1885 the

5 This is the equivalent to the use of index numbers with the base rate expressed as 100. The base
rates were standardized to the occupational distribution of the women 50-54 in 1910 (considered as
45-49 in 1905). This was done to eliminate the effect
of changing occupational composition on magnitude
of the base rate.

6 The farm laborers constituted only about 3% of
the native white wives 45-49 in 1910, and 2% in
1940. They formed about 2% of the white wives in
1950 and 1% in 1960. Since 1960 they probably have
been increasingly composed of Mexican and Puerto
Rican migrant workers (see Table 7).

deviations of the extreme classes from the
average were small. The deviations were at
the maximum during 1920-50. Since 1950,
the range of variations has decreased considerably.

When the analysis is restricted to urban
whites In nonagricultural occupations, there
is still a distinct enlargement of the differentials prior to 1910 and a distinct contraction after 1950. There is little difference between 1910 and 1940 with respect to relative
variation in fertility by occupational group
among urban white women of completed
fertility. The rates are shown in Table 5 and
are plotted on a semi-logarithmic chart in
Figure 3. The indices of relative variations
are shown in Table 6 and Figure 4.

The relative variations in fertility of
urban white women were larger for women
45-49 years old in 1950 than for women that
age in 1940. However, there was a sharp
contraction during 1950-60. For women of
younger ages, there was a sharp contraction
after 1940 (Kiser, Grabill, and Campbell,
1968, p. 204-206).

Social Biology

The changes in occupational distribution
during the past eighty years have been remarkable. Because of differential mortality
according to socioeconomic status, the distributions for the years 1890, 1900, 1920,
and 1930 probably are somewhat overly represented by the white-collar groups and under-represented by the laborers and agricultural workers. However, the data in the
upper tier of Table 7 reflect strongly and
truly the decline in proportion of farmers
and the increase in the proportion of nonagricultural workers, especially those classified as clerical, craft, and operatives. When
the distributions are restricted to the wives
of nonagricultural workers, as in the lower
section of Table 7, the most striking increases were those for operatives.

and following censuses for total women and
ever-married women, by age and residence.’

As expected, the range of relative variations in fertility by education tends to be
wider for all women than for ever-married
women, especially at younger ages. This is
because differentials by proportions married
tend to run in the same direction as differentials in fertility (Kiser, Grabill, and Campbell, 1968, p. 156).

The patterns of variations in fertility by
education since 1940 have been much the
same as those by occupation. Among white
women or married women at each five-year
age group in the 20-44 span there were sharp
contractions in the differentials during 194060. Figure 5 presents the data for women
35-39 years old. Among the women 45-49,
there was again a similarity with the occupational pattern in that the range of relative
variations increased a little from 1940 to
1950 and then decreased (Figure 6). This
suggests that the older women were mani
7 In the computations for all women regardless of
marital status, the never-married women were as
sumed to be childless. This assumption is fairly valid
for urban white women.

festing an earlier period of expansion of class
differences in fertility.

It should be emphasized that the sharp
contractions in fertility differentials of
white women by occupation of the husband
and by educational attainment of the wife
occurred in the context of increasing fertility
during the 1940-60 period. The increases
were proportionately higher for the wives of
professional and white-collar workers and
for wives of college attainment than for
wives of lower socioeconomic status.

The available data for years since 1960, a
period of declining fertility, yield somewhat
mixed results. Data on number of own children under 5 years old collected by the Bureau of the Census in Current Population
Surveys in March 1968 and 1967 indicated
higher percentage decreases of the ratios
from 1960 to 1968 among the farm than
among the nonfarm women, greater declines
among nonwhites than among whites, and
greater declines among women graduating
from high school than among those of lower
educational attainment (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 19692).

1968, p. 156) data for 1940 relate to native white women. Data for 1965 relate to women 40-44 in 1960.

Thus the post-1960 trends, according to
these data, are in the directions of a contraction of differentials by farm status and race,
but a strengthening of differentials by education. For definitive indications of trends
we must await the 1970 census.

SUMMARY

In broad summary, the changing patterns
of fertility in the United States, like those in
other modern countries, have included the
following features: With respect to overall
levels of fertility there was a long and continuous decline over the period 1800-1936.
A postwar baby boom characterized the
decade 1947-57, and this was implemented
partly by increase in marriage and lowering
age at marriage, and decrease in intervals
between marriage and first and successive
births. The increase heralded no return to
the large families of 1910 and earlier, but
was due to a sharp decrease in the proportion

having 0-1 children and a larger increase in
the proportion having 2-4. The decrease in
the birth rate since 1957 has been implemented by the onset of the reverse trends
toward higher age at marriage and larger
intervals between marriage and first and
successive births.

With respect to differentials, there has
been a widening of the variations in fertility
by color and perhaps also by religion. There
has been a narrowing of differentials in fertility by region, urban-rural, and socioeconomic status.

Available data suggest that differential
fertility by socioeconomic status may be
largely, but not entirely, a transitional phenomenon associated with the demographic
transition. The occupational variations in
size of completed family were of relatively
small consequence in 1885. They widened
considerably during the period 1885-1920.

socioeconomic status were probably fairly
prevalent during 1920-40, although trends
toward diminution had begun among
younger women. During 1950-65, the class
differences in completed fertility, as well as

those among young women, diminished
greatly. The decrease in the crude birth rate
since 1957 appears to have been accompanied by some reassertion of fertility differentials among young women.
