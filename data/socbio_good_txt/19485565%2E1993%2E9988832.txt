ABSTRACT: Existing data linking testosterone (T) and aggression in human adult males are
surprisingly tenuous. In one of the few studies based on adolescent males, Olweus et al. (1988)
demonstrated strong relationships between concurrent measures of T and aggression. However,
the conclusions that could be drawn regarding developmental change were limited. Using data
from a three-year panel study of 100 adolescent males (ages 12 to 13 at study entry), we examined
whether there are significant relationships between concurrently collected measures of T and
self-ratings of aggression, and whether the dramatic pubertal rise in T predicts subsequent
change in aggression ratings. Panel analyses incorporating concurrent, lagged, and change
measures found few significant relationships between aggression and T or pubertal development.
The general absence of T/aggression relationships is discussed in the context of other empirical

findings, the aggression measures used, and prepubertal differentiation on aggression.

A causal link between testosterone
(T) and aggression in human males
seems to be taken for granted in public
discourse, though the empirical foundation for this conclusion is surprisingly tenuous. In a recent review of the
literature, Archer (1991) concluded
that ‘‘although it has been established
in a wide range of vertebrate groups
that testosterone facilitates aggression,
there is little or no conclusive evidence
for primates (p.-3).”’ Existing data for
humans are especially equivocal, and
crucial evidence showing that increases
in T lead to increases in aggression is
entirely missing.

A number of studies of human adult
males have reported positive relationships between concurrently collected
measures of T and aggression. However, these relationships often represent a few instances of statistical significance out of a large set of cor
relations that are close to zero (e.g.,
Christiansen and Knussmann, 1987;
Monti et al., 1977). In addition, the
magnitude of significant correlations is
usually low (mid-to-upper 0.20’s). Reports of stronger relationships between
T and aggression measures are typically based on samples of 20 or fewer
individuals (e.g., Persky et al., 1971;
Doering et al., 1975; Scaramella and
Brown, 1978), suggesting the possibility that the relationships are spuriously
high.

Evidence of a T/aggression relationship based on general adult male
samples is ambiguous. However, one
might expect that the link would be
more apparent in imprisoned populations, where individuals with histories
of violent behavior can be included.
However, the results of such studies
have also been equivocal. Comparisons of T levels between high and low

aggression groups, defined either by
histories of extremely violent crimes or
aggressive behavior in prison, do not
consistently yield significant differences, nor are there reliable patterns of
correlations across studies between T
and aggression measured with selfreport inventories, external raters, or
records of behavior in prison (see
Meyer-Bahlburg, 1981, and Archer,
1991, for reviews of this literature).

During adolescence, males experience a ten- to twenty-fold increase in T
(Faiman and Winter, 1974; Knorr et
al., 1974; Lee et al., 1974). The coincidence of this dramatic pubertal rise in
T with the deviant or aggressive behavior that is seen in some individuals suggests the possibility of an “‘activation”
effect of T. Only a few studies have investigated the relationship between aggression and T in human male adolescents. Susman et al. (1987), using a
sample of 9- to 14-year-old male and
female adolescents, found no relationships between adolescents’ T levels and
maternal ratings of the adolescents on
the attributes Delinquent, Aggressive,
Rebellious, or Nasty. A subsequent report (Inoff-Germain et al., 1988), using the same sample but different aggression measures, also found no
relationship between T and adolescents’ expressions of anger and attempts to control or defy their parents
during videotaped family interactions
on problem-solving tasks.! Although
this sample was studied using a panel design, no models incorporating
changes in T or lagged hormone effects
have been reported.

‘Each set of analyses yielded a few significant
relationships with less potent androgens. However,
patterns varied by aggression measure, hormone,
and sex of subjects.

 

Adolescent Males 9

Probably the best known work on
hormone/aggression relationships in
human adolescent males is that by Olweus and his colleagues (Olweus et al.,
1980; 1988). Applying path analysis
techniques to longitudinal behavioral
data from 58 normal adolescent males
(average age of 16 at the time of testosterone measurement), Olweus demonstrated that plasma testosterone in
Grade 9 is a significant predictor of
Grade 9 Provoked Aggressive Behavior (as measured by self-report on
the Olweus Multi-faceted Aggression
Inventory—OMAI), even when level
of pubertal development, child rearing
patterns relevant to aggressive behavior, and antecedent measures of provoked aggressive behavior at Grade
6 are taken into account. These T/
aggression relationships are impressive, because they are based on a reasonably large sample of normal adolescents, and the analyses control for
pubertal development, prepubertal
levels of aggression, and several antecedent social variables relevant to aggressive behavior. However, as the authors point out, the boys in their
sample were already highly differentiated on aggressive behavior prior to
the pubertal rise in T. Grade 9 Provoked Aggression correlated at 0.54
with Provoked Aggression at Grade 6,
before the pubertal rise in T for most
boys. Thus, aggressiveness at Grade 9
does not “depend on circulating levels
of T at puberty for this appearance”’
(Olweus et al., 1988, p. 270).

Similar assessments taken on a sample of 40 delinquent adolescent males
(the 58 normals served as controls
for the delinquent sample) produced
weaker relationships with self-ratings
on the OMAI than were found for the

10 Halpern et al.

control sample (Mattsson et al., 1980).
Further, T was not correlated with any
aggression ratings that were made by
institutional staff or that were included
in psychiatric evaluations of the delinquent sample.

A recent study (Gladue, 1991) used
a modified version of the OMAT to
examine relationships among testosterone, estradiol, sexual orientation,
and aggressiveness in a sample of heterosexual and homosexual males and
females ranging in age from their mid20’s to mid-30’s. The findings of interest here were that total T and estradiol
were each significantly correlated with
OMAI measures of physical and verbal
aggression for the 40 male subjects.
Total T was also significantly correlated with impulsiveness, and estradiol
was significantly correlated with impatience. Interestingly, free T, the biologically active component of total T,
was not significantly correlated with
any of the measures for males, despite
the 0.80 correlation between assays of
total and free T. Although this replication of a relationship between total T
and physical/verbal aggression as measured in the OMAT ts impressive, the
absence of significant relationships
with free T is puzzling.

In sum, findings reported to date in
the human literature on T/aggression
relationships are equivocal. Most studies have used small samples, and when
significant relationships between T and
aggression have been found, it is often
only for a small subset of the aggression measures included in the study, or
when the data are examined in one particular way. Some of the most interesting findings to date, those of Olweus
and colleagues using adolescent samples, are limited in the conclusions that

 

Social Biology

can be drawn about developmental
change. Use of T-values measured at
the same time as the ninth-grade measures of aggression demonstrates only
that causality is plausible. The presence of a significant T/aggression relationship after antecedent social factors and earlier levels of aggression
have been controlled for strengthens
a causal interpretation. However, the
dependent variable in the path analysis— Grade 9 aggression—should be interpreted as equivalent to a change in
ageression between grades 6 and 9. In
essence, the ninth-grade T value is being used to predict a change in aggression that occurred before the T measurement. The f value of 0.195
reported for the path between Provoked Aggression measured at Grade
6 and T measured at Grade 9 suggests
the possibility that experience of aggressive encounters may influence later
T levels (Archer, 1991). Because humans are already well-differentiated
on aggression prior to the hormonal
changes of puberty, and because of
the possibility that experience may affect hormones, a stronger argument
for hormonal causality must include a
demonstration that there are postpubertal increases in aggression that
coincide with, or are subsequent to,
pubertal increases in testosterone. A
panel study of males in early puberty
should provide a particularly convincing design to test the relationship between increases in T and aggressive
behavior. This paper examines that
possibility.

Using data from a three-year panel
study of 100 early adolescent males, we
explore several aspects of the relationship between T and aggression. First,
we examine whether there is a signifiDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

cant relationship between concurrently
collected measures of T and aggression
in the present sample. In particular, we
will attempt to replicate the findings of
Olweus et al. (1980), using a subset of
items from the Olweus Multifaceted
Aggression Inventory (OMAI). Second, we examine whether pubertal
changes in T and physical development
predict changes in aggressive behavior.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The present sample was constructed
for the purpose of examining the effects of pubertal changes in T on the
initiation and increase of sexual activity during adolescence (Halpern et
al., 1993). However, several measures
of aggression were included in the
study and will be used in the present
analyses.

SUBJECTS

A list of all white males in grades 7
and 8 was obtained from a county
school district in a southeastern state.
The school district is a mixture of urban, suburban, and rural areas centered on a medium-sized city. A subfile
was prepared of 12- and 13-year-old
boys. Potential participants were randomly selected from the subfile and interviewers were sent to their homes to
solicit their participation. First, signed
consent was obtained from a parent for
the boy’s participation, and then the
boy was solicited, and his signed consent obtained. About half the boys solicited were recruited for the project;
refusals were about evenly split between parents and adolescents. The
sample is essentially middle and lower
middle class. Three-quarters of the
sample have an annual household in

come exceeding $30,000. A third of the
households’ annual incomes exceed
$50,000. Forty-two per cent of fathers
and 36 per cent of mothers have a college degree or higher. Only 10 per cent
of parents did not complete high
school. Demographic characteristics of
this sample are similar to those found
for earlier studies in this research line
that yielded higher recruitment rates
(Halpern et al., 1994). Initially, 127
boys agreed to participate and completed at least one project questionnaire or procedure.

DATA COLLECTION TYPE AND
SEQUENCE

Boys completed a self-administered
questionnaire during five semiannual
interviews and completed a sixth questionnaire one year later; the time between the first and sixth interview was
about three years. Subjects also completed the Personality Research Form,
Form E (Jackson, 1984) annually during the first two years of the project,
for a total of three administrations, and
the Adjective Checklist (Gough and
Heilbrun, 1983) annually during all
three years, for a total of four administrations. All questionnaires were
completed in subjects’ homes with an
interviewer present.

A set of physical measures, an 18 ml
blood sample and 5 ml saliva sample
were obtained semiannually by registered nurses (RNs) employed by the
project. In most cases, these data were
collected in the subjects’ homes. A few
boys opted to complete the physical
measures at a local hospital, where
measures were completed by the same
project nurses who conducted home
visits.

12 Halpern et al.

In addition to collecting semiannual
data items, project interviewers visited
the boys’ homes weekly, during which
time the boys completed a short behavior checklist covering the past week,
and donated a first morning saliva sample and an afternoon saliva sample.
Data collected on the weekly schedule
are not included in present analyses.

MEASURES

Semiannual Questionnaire. — The
content of the semiannual questionnaires was broad and included questions about family demographics, the
subject’s social and sexual experiences,
school achievement, and aspirations
for the future. Also included was a
series of items for self-assessment of
pubertal development, incorporating
Tanner-type line drawings of pubic
hair development and genital growth,
as well as questions about the development of facial and body hair,
height and weight changes, and voice
changes.

Self-ratings of Aggression.—Most
aggression measures used in the
present analyses appeared in the semiannual questionnaire. Three items
(Argues, Fights, Trouble at School)
were taken from the Interpersonal
Competence Scale-S (Cairns et al.,
1989), a self-rating instrument that
yields self-perception scores on aggression, popularity, and academic competence. In the present study, item wording was unchanged from the original
scale. However, a five-point scale ranging from “hardly ever” to ‘“‘a lot” (e.g.,
hardly ever gets in fights . . . gets in
fights a lot) was used rather than the
Original seven-point scale. For pur
 

Social Biology

poses of data analyses, poles have been
coded so that 1 = hardly ever and
5 = a lot.

Three additional items (Fight Nonfamily Member, Argue with Non-family Member, Damage Property) were
included in a list of deviance items.
At each questionnaire administration,
subjects were asked to indicate how often they had done each of these things
in the past six months. The response
scale ranged from never (0) to more
than 10 times (4). These variables are
an indicator of the cumulative incidence of these behaviors over sixmonth periods.

A subset of items from the Olweus
Multifaceted Aggression Inventory
(OMAI, Olweus, 1975) was included
in the final questionnaire completed at
the end of year three. Items from the
Verbal Aggression, Physical Aggression, and Lack of Frustration Tolerance Scales were included. A subset of
items from the Verbal and Physical
Aggression scales that contains a threat
element can be used to generate a Provoked Aggression Scale score. Item
wording and scoring was unchanged;
each item is scored on a scale from 1 to
6 and, depending on the item, is rated
in terms of how often the description
applies to the subject (seldom or very
seldom [1] to very often [6]) or how
well the description applies to the subject (does not apply at all to me [1] to
applies exactly to me [6]). Aggression
scale scores from the Adjective Checklist and the Personality Research Form
are also used in the present analyses.

Physical Measures. —Measures performed by the nurses included height,
weight, blood pressure, several anthropometric measures, ratings of body

hair, Tanner stage ratings of pubic hair
and genital growth (Tanner, 1962), and
testicular volume. All nurses were
trained in the exam protocol by the
same trainer. Boys whose exams were
conducted in the home setting often refused to allow the nurse to assess testicular volume and Tanner stage. In
these instances, the nurse instructed
the subject in the use of the orchidometer, and the subject performed the
ratings/measurements himself. At the
first exam, 70 per cent of subjects refused to allow the nurse to make these
ratings. Among subjects who allowed
the nurses to assess Tanner stage and
testicular volume, self-ratings and RN
ratings correlated at 0.80. Given this
high correlation, exam data that included self-ratings instead of RNratings for these items were not distinguished in the construction of exambased pubertal factor scores discussed
below.

Blood Samples.—As part of the
semiannual physical examination,
three blood samples were collected at
15-minute intervals using an indwelling
catheter and heparin lock. To address
the issue of pulsatile release, the samples were pooled to achieve a “‘biological average.” Samples were kept cool
in the field and centrifuged within 4
hours of collection. Plasma was separated and stored at —80 C until assay.
A 5 ml saliva sample was also collected
during the exam. However, saliva assay data are not reported here. All
physical specimens were collected between 3:00 and 9:00 p.m. Between
these hours the diurnal rhythm curve
for T is nearly flat (Butler et al., 1989).
The average difference between collection times for different rounds of data

collection within individual boys was
an hour.

Hormone Assays. —Plasma samples
were assayed for testosterone (T)
and sex hormone binding globulin
(SHBG). Testosterone assays were
performed using the Diagnostic Products Corporation [125 Coat-a-Count
kit; SHBG assays were performed using the Farmos Diagnostica 1125 kit.
All samples were assayed in duplicate
and, for a subset of specimens, were
cross-validated against values generated from two other labs. (See Halpern
and Udry, 1992 for a description of the
validation process.)

Analyses to be reported here use total testosterone, both for simplicity and
to parallel the analyses reported by
Olweus et al. (1980) and most other
studies in this content area. However,
use of an approximation of a Free
Testosterone Index (FTI; T/SHBG x
100), a unit-free ratio of T and SHBG,
produces similar results and conclusions.

Pubertal Development — Pubertal
development is indexed by a factor
score based on items from the nurses’
exam. The following items were submitted to a principal components analysis: Tanner stage of pubic hair and
genital growth, testicular volume, and
presence and density of axillary, facial
and leg hair. The analysis was performed on a pooled data set that combined all five rounds of physical exams
and generated a single factor. Pooling
five rounds allowed for the generation
of factor scores based on a wider range
of physical development. An individual’s score thus reflects his position relative to the physical development of
the entire sample over two years.

14 Halpern et al.

Because only self-ratings of physical
development were obtained in the
third year follow-up, any analyses requiring a pubertal score from the third
year use factor scores based on a subject’s self-ratings were obtained as part
of the semiannual questionnaires.? A
validity study of these self-assessment
items comparing males’ self-assessment factor score with pediatricians’
assessment factor score yielded a correlation of 0.72 (Morris and Udry,
1980). Subject-based pubertal scores
for the present study were constructed
parallel to those based on the nurses’
ratings. However, scores from subjects’ self-ratings span a three-year period. Correlations between nurse- and
subject-based pubertal factor scores at
Rounds 1-5 ranged from 0.71 to 0.84.

RESULTS
OMAI SCALES

One of our purposes is to replicate
the findings of Olweus in a different
sample of adolescent males of similar
age. Therefore, it will be helpful to
compare the physical characteristics of
the two samples. Because the OMAI
items were administered only at the final round of data collection in the
present study, we will analyze these
variables separately from the other aggression indices with repeated measurements. Table 1 lists descriptive information for Olweus’ sample of 58
normal adolescents and parallel information for the 82 subjects in our sample who completed the final round of

used.

 

Social Biology

data collection. The final round (end of
year 3) is the most comparable point to
the hormone results reported by Olweus. Subjects in the present sample
are similar in age to the subjects in the
Olweus sample. However, a greater
percentage of boys in the Olweus sample are at Tanner Stage 5 for both genital growth and pubic hair development. The Olweus sample also has a
higher mean T level, although this is at
least partly due to the collection of
blood samples in the morning versus
afternoon and evening collection in the
present study. Assay differences may
also contribute to differences in means.
Although the samples are close in
terms of chronological age, the present
sample, at the final round of data collection, is less physically developed
than that of Olweus and includes a few
subjects whose afternoon T levels are
still in the prepubertal range.

Table 2 lists correlation coefficients
between OMAI scales completed at
Round 6, and T and pubertal development measured at the same and earlier
rounds. Correlations between T and
OMAT scales reported by Olweus et al.
(1980) are also listed. In contrast to the
1980 Olweus results, correlations between concurrent measures of T and
each OMAI scale in the present sample
are small and nonsignificant. Correlations with concurrent measures of pubertal development are _ essentially
zero.

The nonbold correlations in Table
2 reflect various lag times between
measures Of T or pubertal development and the OMAI scales completed
at Round 6. All of the coefficients using T are negative, and three are statistically significant at the 0.05 level or
better. About half of the correlations

review of the plots of the T correlations
revealed that five subjects who rated
themselves as very high in aggression
at Round 6 and had started the study at
very low levels of T were contributing

heavily to the negative correlations
with early T values. Using early rounds
of T, there are no high T/high aggression subjects to “‘balance” the low
T/high aggression subjects, and therefore a negative relationship is generated. As the low Ty/high aggression
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

16 Halpern et al.

subjects increase in T over the course
of the study, the negative relationship
between T and the OMAI Round 6
measures attenuates. Although we understand the attenuation of the negative relationship over time, we cannot
explain why there are no boys with
high OMAT scores at Round 6 who
were relatively high in T at Round 1.
We therefore leave these negative relationships uninterpreted.

In summary, we have not replicated
significant positive relationships between concurrent measures of T and
OMAI scores in our sample. Concurrent measures of pubertal development are also unrelated to scores on
these scales. Correlations between T
measured 1 to 3 years prior to the
OMAI scales are relatively small and
consistently negative; most are nonsignificant.

RELATIONSHIPS AMONG CONCURRENT
MEASURES OF T, PUBERTAL
DEVELOPMENT, AND AGGRESSION
Over TIME

Except for the OMAT scales, we
have aggression measures at six-month
intervals for two years, and a sixth set
of measures at the end of Year 3. To
examine the relationship between concurrent measures of T/pubertal development and aggression over time, we
performed repeated measures Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) on each
aggression measure using T or puber
3It is unlikely that we would have found positive
sizable relationships between early measures of T
and Round 6 OMAI measures. In order to produce
a positive relationship with T measured 2 to 3 years
before the aggression measures, all boys who were
prepubertal (i.e., boys who were low in T) at the
early rounds of the study would have to be low in
aggression at the end of the study. This pattern is
unlikely, given the differentiation on aggression that
exists prior to puberty.

tal development as a time-varying covariate.

A summary of the results of the repeated measures ANOVA’s is listed in
Table 3. Results of other models to be
discussed below are also included in
the table. Means and standard deviations for all the variables at each round
are listed in Table 4. Scores for four of
the eight aggression measures (Argues, Argue with Non-Family, Trouble
at School, Damage Property) changed
significantly over time. However, as
can be seen in Table 4, the mean scores
do not systematically increase or decrease from round to round.4

Significance tests of concurrently
collected T values were not significant
for any aggression measures at the 0.05
level. Two tests of the time*T interaction were significant: the relationships
between concurrent levels of T and
the variables Argues and Trouble at
School change over time. Examination
of single-degree-of-freedom regression
terms for each aggression measure
showed that the signs of the regression
coefficients varied across rounds.

Tests of pubertal development were
significant only on the variables Trouble at School and Damage Property;
over all rounds, boys who were more
pubertally developed rated themselves
as more likely to get into trouble and
reported more instances of property
damage. For the variable Argues, the
effects of pubertal development varied
significantly over time. In contrast to
the relationship with T over time, the

‘Because not all subject have complete T data
across rounds, the N for testosterone models is
smaller than the pubertal development models.
Therefore, results of the significance test of change
in the aggression measures over time vary slightly
between the T and pubertal development models.

relationship between pubertal development and Argues was consistently
positive over rounds, but the strength
of the relationship varied in nonsystematic ways over time.

In summary, concurrent measures
of both testosterone and pubertal development are related to the variable
Argues. However, the direction of T
effects varies by round, while the relationship with pubertal development is
consistently positive. Pubertal development is also related to getting in
Trouble at School and incidents of
Damaging Property, and these relationships are relatively stable over all
six rounds.

RELATIONSHIPS AMONG LAGGED
MEASURES OF T, PUBERTAL
DEVELOPMENT, AND AGGRESSION
OVER TIME

ANOVA models on each of the
eight aggression measures were repeated incorporating, in separate models, six-month and one-year lag periods
between measures of T or pubertal
development and measures of aggression. Because rounds 5 and 6 are
separated by one year, Round 6 data
were not included in the six-month lag
models.

All tests of T were nonsignificant. However, six-month lag models showed significant relationships
between pubertal development and
Argue with Non-family, Trouble at
School and Damage Property. The regression coefficients for pubertal development were positive in each case.
Models using one-year lag periods
also showed a significant relationship
between pubertal development and
Damage Property, and a marginal relationship with Fights; both relation

ships were positive. Pubertal development was consistently and positively
related to Argues, but again the size of
the relationship varied nonsystematically across rounds.

In summary, no lagged relationships
with T were significant for any aggression variable. Pubertal development is
a significant predictor of Damage
Property in both six-month and oneyear lag models, as it was in models using concurrent measures. Boys who are
more physically developed report
more property damage incidents six
months to one year later.

RELATIONSHIPS AMONG CHANGES IN T,
PUBERTAL DEVELOPMENT, AND
AGGRESSION OVER TIME

A parallel set of ANOVA’s was run
that examined whether changes in
T or pubertal development predicted
change in aggression, and whether this
relationship varied over time. Two sets
of analyses to test concurrent change
relationships were run. One set examined whether six-month changes in T
or pubertal development predicted sixmonth changes in aggression. The second set examined whether changes in
T or pubertal development over oneyear periods predicted changes in
aggression for concurrent one-year periods.

Changes in T were not significant in
six-month change models. However, T
change over one-year periods was significantly and positively related to concurrent one-year changes in the variable Fights and ACL Aggression Scale.
There were also marginal Time*T
change interactions on the Aggression
scales of the ACL and PRF. For both
scales, the direction of the relationship
varied over the one-year time periods.
 

Vol. 40, No. 1-2

Pubertal change was not significant
in any of the six-month change models;
a single model testing one-year change
scores was significant. In this case there
was a negative relationship between
change in pubertal development and
change in the PRF Aggression scale.
A final set of models was run that
examined the relationships over time
between six-month changes in T or pu= bertal development and six-month
changes in aggression that were lagged
6 by six months. (Testing, for example,
5 whether the change in T between
rounds 1 and 2 predict aggression

lagged change failed to yield substantive and consistent findings for either T
or pubertal development.

DISCUSSION

The present design, with repeated
measurements of T and aggression during the pubertal period, should provide
an ideal context for assessing the influence of pubertal increases in T on ag
Adolescent Males 21

gressive behavior in adolescent males.
The results provide little evidence of a
systematic relationship between aggression and concurrent or earlier measures of T. Further, changes in T
showed little relationship with either
concurrent or lagged changes in aggression. These findings are based exclusively on self-ratings. However, results using one-time maternal ratings of
subjects on the items Fights and Argues (analyses not shown) were consistent in showing no relationship between aggression and proximal values
of T.

Pubertal development, like T, was
unrelated to most of the aggression
measures. The one exception is the
variable Damage Property. In this
case, both concurrent and earlier measures of pubertal development were
positively related to reports of this behavior. The strength of the relationship
did not vary significantly over the time
period covered by the study.

The general absence of relationships between T/pubertal development
and aggression is perhaps not surprising, given that we have no evidence of
a systematic increase in aggression during the three years of the study. Although a few measures show significant
change over time, in each case the
change appears to reflect fluctuation
rather than systematic increase. In addition to the absence of systematic
change in the average level of aggression, individuals tend to retain their
“position,” relative to others, over
time. With three exceptions, correlations between aggression measures
separated by three years were around
0.50, a figure similar to the 0.54 coefficient reported by Olweus et al. (1980)
for Provoked Aggression at grades 6

22

and 9. Correlations for the variables
Argues, Fights and Trouble at School
over three years were in the 0.30’s.

It is possible that there are pubertal
changes in aggressiveness that our
measures have failed to tap. Although
the aggression measures used here are
probably comparable, and in some
cases are identical, to those used in
other studies, they may not be ideal for
tapping developmental change. More
concrete measures such as objective
records of aggressive incidents or observational ratings of subjects in provocative situations may be better indicators of subjects’ increased capacities
to respond aggressively in contexts that
are meaningful to them. It is possible
that a different set of aggression indices, measured over time, would yield
significant relationships between pubertal changes in T and aggressive behavior, and possibly a broader range of
relationships with pubertal development.

The likelihood that the overall pattern of our findings is limited to these
particular measures, however, should
be evaluated with two considerations
in mind. First, the relative stability in
aggression suggested by the present
data is consistent with other evidence
that some aspects of aggressive behavior may be stable or even decrease during early adolescence for normal samples (Achenback and Edelbrock, 1981;
Simmons and Blyth, 1987; Cairns et
al., 1989). Except for individuals who
are already troubled as children, it is
unclear that there are meaningful increases in aggression (excluding recklessness or deviant behavior that does
not involve actual aggressive elements)
during adolescence for most individuals (Buchanan et al., 1992 ). In his 1979

Halpern et al.

 

Social Biology

review of longitudinal studies of male
aggressive reaction patterns as measured by external raters, Olweus concluded that “the across-time stability
of aggressive behavior was not much
lower than that typically found in the
intelligence domain’? (Olweus, 1979,
p. 872). The longitudinal data of
Cairns et al. (1989) also indicated
highly reliable individual differences
over a six-year period. Although this
stability over time does not necessarily
allow one to predict individual behavior across particular situations
(Olweus, 1979), it does suggest that
systematic increases in aggressive behavior within individuals during adolescence is not the norm.

It has been suggested that the appearance of a normative increase in
violence at adolescence may be due to
already aggressive individuals who
have better ability and opportunity
to injure others (Cairns et al., 1989).
If individuals are already welldifferentiated on aggression during
childhood, and if most do not show systematic increases in aggression during
or shortly after the pubertal rise in T,
then pubertal changes in T are unlikely
to play a direct, fundamental role in
determining aggressive behavior for
most individuals. The role of pubertal
development may be one of offering
better physical ability to express already existing aggressiveness.

A second consideration in evaluating the present findings is that they are
generally consistent with those of other
investigations. Most studies that have
found T/aggression relationships have
been based on very small, and sometimes highly selected samples. Even in
these cases, demonstrated relationships may be limited to a subset of

aggression measures or to a single type
of data analysis. The few studies using
larger samples of normals have tended
to find relatively small, scattered relationships.

There are instances of significant,
positive relationships between concurrent levels of T and selected aggression
measures in the present data. For example, at the initial round of data collection at early adolescence, there are
significant, positive relationships of
about 0.30 between T (and/or the Free
9 Testosterone Index) and fighting be® havior as indexed by incidents in the
past six months or as a more global rating. In addition, one-year changes in T
are significantly and positively related
to one-year changes in the variable
Fights. However, examination of T/
aggression relationships over time indicate that most of the relationships selected from particular points in time do
not persist over time, nor are they re> flected in within-subject analyses using
concurrent, lagged, or T-change measures. Significant relationships in panel
models are, as in other studies using a

23

single round of measurement, limited
to one or two variables within a single
time frame of change.

Theoretically, T could affect aggressive behavior either through the organizational effects of prenatal exposure
or through activational effects caused
by pubertal increases in the hormone.
Available evidence regarding the possible influence of prenatal androgens
on aggression in humans is limited,
both in terms of quantity and method.
What is available is mostly negative,
though hardly conclusive (Archer,
1991). If there are meaningful behavioral effects of pubertal T, they may
likely be contingent on the level of prenatal exposure. It is possible that any
effects of pubertal changes in T on aggressive behavior would be apparent
only when prenatal organizational effects can be taken into account. If this
is the case, repeated assessment of hormones, including measures from both
the prenatal and pubertal periods,
would be necessary for a more complete assessment of hormonal contributions to aggressive behavior.
