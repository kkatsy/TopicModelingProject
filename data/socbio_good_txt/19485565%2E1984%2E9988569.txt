ABSTRACT: This paper investigates a late nineteenth-century fertility transition in a predominantly Mormon population of the western United States. A unique set of longitudinal data composed of 31,500 computerized family genealogies is drawn upon to examine a number of problems identified in reappraisals of fertility transition research (Caldwell, 1981; Freedman, 1979).
Four subcohorts, differentiated by religious commitment and exposure to urban influences, are
examined over the course of the transition. The study presents traditional analyses of subcohort
CEB levels, period MTFR’s, and m values (Coale and Trussell, 1974) and focuses on a macrosimulation of the fertility transition within the population (Bongaarts, 1976). Despite wide subcohort variation in cross-sectional levels of fertility over time, simulation results suggest a simituz
absolute longitudinal decline in fertility levels, parity at which contraception was initiated, and
maximum birth parities for all four subcohorts. The implications of these results for future anal

yses and the desirability of individual level data are discussed.

An increasing cumulation of historical demographic studies of the fertility
transition from high or “‘natural’’ fertility to low or “controlled” fertility has
generated a number of new theoretical
and methodological arguments concerning the transition (Caldwell, 1976, 1978;
Teitelbaum, 1975; van de Walle and
Knodel, 1980). The interest in developing new approaches to accounting for
the fertility transition derives largely
from a series of problems associated
with the concept of the transition itself.
These problems have been succinctly
summarized by Freedman (1979) and
reflect the findings from an extensive set
of studies dealing with the fertility transition in Western Europe. It has also
been argued that similar fertility
changes are to be observed in areas settled by descendants of Europeans.
However, few efforts have been made

to integrate theoretical and methodological refinements resulting from historical European fertility studies in fertility studies of the United States and
other areas of European settlement.
Specifically, the lack of empirical
confirmation of many traditional notions of fertility change associated with
the concept of the fertility transition appears to stem from the analysis of highly
ageregated data. Identification of sociocultural or socioreligious subcohorts
from more refined data have suggested
that culturally similar areas in Western
Europe moved together in changing fertility without prime reference to socioeconomic, developmental indices critical to many transition theories (Knodel
and van de Walle, 1979). Secondly,
given that different levels of fertility are
found in a number of different populations which approximate natural fertility

schedules (Dupaquier, 1979), failure to
deal systematically with structural or
compositional shifts such as differential
rates of growth among significant population subgroups results in some level of
uncertainty about transition studies
which ignore fertility differentials
among sociocultural subgroups. Thirdly, Knodel stipulates that the appropriate specification of the fertility transition
requires the identification of a change
from a state marked by the absence of
parity-dependent fertility control—
natural fertility as expressed in particular age patterns of fertility—to a state
marked by the presence of paritydependent control in marital unions
(1977). Specification of the emergence
of parity-dependent control, in turn, requires information on age-specific marital fertility patterns over time.

Because initial shifts from natural to
controlled fertility typically occur prior
to the availability of effective vital registration systems, studies of such changes
usually depend upon village genealogies
or upon family reconstitutions. As a
general rule, therefore, studies of the
shift from natural to parity dependent
fertility control are often limited to a few
villages or communities, making it difficult to identify change among diverse
sociocultural or socioreligious groups.
In addition, records are typically community-specific without information on
fertility behavior before the resident enters or after he or she leaves a specified
set of villages. The researcher is thus not
always in a position to distinguish
among variations in fertility change
which may arise as a result of changing
heterogeneities in the subject communities.

The research reported in this paper
therefore represents a logical extension
and an essential refinement of previous

studies of the fertility transition. First,
we are dealing with an American frontier population of the nineteenth century which initially evidenced a natural
fertility schedule (Mineau et al., 1979).
By implication, the data available for
study provide for the essential detail
necessary to infer the presence ofa natural fertility schedule. Second, we analyze data for this population over a period of slightly more than half a century
during which a significant reduction in
fertility occurs. Third, we empirically
identify significant subcohorts of the
populations in terms of theoretically relevant socioreligious variables, and examine subcohort changes in levels and
patterns of fertility. Fourth, using a
macrosimulation model which allows
for subcohort identifications, we examine the extent to which underlying behavioral changes—independent of
structural shifts in the population—
explain variations in fertility patterns
over time.

This data set is part of a larger research effort described in previous articles (Skolnick et al., 1978; Bean et al.,
1978; Mineau et al., 1979) and contains
approximately 180,000 computerized
Utah genealogies, Briefly, these genealogies are drawn from an archive (Bean
et al,, 1980) of family group sheets
maintained by the Utah Genealogical
Society. Those family group sheets selected for inclusion in the computerized
database met the criterion of at least one
family member having a recorded demographic event (birth or death) on the
Mormon pioneer trail or in Utah. The
data used in the present analyses consist
of 31,500 once-married couples (husband and wife married only once) with
the wife born between 1840 and 1899
and known to have survived to at least
49 years of age. The treatment of miss

ing information and quality controls in
our analysis is discussed in Willigan et
al. (1982).

Based on analysis of these data,
results of macrosimulations will permit
more precise description of the emergence of parity-dependent fertility control among four subcohorts of this population. The subcohorts are empirically
specified through the use of individuallevel data which enable us to classify the
population by religious (i.e., pronatalist) commitment and exposure to urban
influences (a proxy measure of urbanization). The rationale for the analytical
procedures adopted and the specification of the variables identifying our subcohorts are outlined in the following section.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Caldwell and Freedman argued that
the fertility transition in Western societies reflects a series of “‘superstructural’? (Caldwell, 1981) changes in aspirations for self and children which may
be quite independent of macrolevel economic shifts (Freedman, 1979). In either
case, these arguments presume the
emergency of fertility limitation within
families, i.e., parity-dependent control
of marital fertility. Various tests have
been used to demonstrate the emergence of increasing fertility limitation
within families: first, shifts in levels of
fertility (van de Walle and Knodel,
1980); second, indirect measures, such
as the “J” indices developed by Coale
(1969 and used by Caldwell, 1981;
Caldwell and Ruzicka, 1978; Knodel,
1977; van de Walle and Knodel, 1980);
and third, a more direct measure, Coale
and Trussell’s m (1974, 1978a, 1978b)
when adequate data are available (Knodel, 1977). We propose a fourth ap

proach which uses a macrosimulation
model developed by Bongaarts (1976)
to investigate the collective effect of
changing proximate determinants of fertility (Bongaarts, 1978) as well as to test
the effect of implied contraceptive use
and efficacy as an indicator of fertility
limitation within families.

The importance of a macrosimulation method which enables testing assumptions about the use and efficacy of
contraception or induced abortion!
arises from the fact that modeling can
suggest how much of an observed
change in fertility arises from: (1) structural demographic changes (changing
patterns of marriage and divorce, for example); (2) a shift from ineffectively
controlled fertility to more effectively
controlled fertility; and (3) a shift from
uncontrolled natural fertility to some
level of parity-dependent controlled fertility. Changes in fertility behavior due
to structural demographic changes may
imply no change in preferences and values attached to children. Similarly,
shifts from partial to more effective control may be independent of changes in
preferences and values related to number of children desired. Only in our third
case of parity-dependent control are we
dealing with a clear-cut pattern of
changing motivation toward achieving
lower family size. Consequently, we
have adopted a macrosimulation approach to investigate changing fertility
patterns. We use individual-level data
over time to apply the model to subcohorts , initially identified as part of a natural fertility population, and then to
subsequent cohorts marked by declining
levels of fertility.

The applicability of the Bongaarts
macrosimulation model to our data set
has been demonstrated in a simulation
of natural fertility patterns within the
Utah population (Willigan et al., 1982).
This prior research demonstrates that
only under assumptions of maximum desired family size, no deliberate abortion,
and no contraceptive use could one obtain an age pattern of marital fertility
which fit observed natural fertility
schedules for those once-married females born between 1840 and 1859. All
other parameters in this simulation were
empirically estimated or controlled
through sample selection, demonstrating that a modeling of the Mormon fertility transition would require a detailed
specification of the adoption of paritydependent contraceptive control (1.e.,
the transition was not due to simple
structural demographic changes or increasing contraceptive efficacy alone).

The macrosimulation model of Bongaarts also has the advantage of allowing
subcohort specification of fertility behavior. Through incorporating subcohorts into the simulation model, variations in fertility due to subgroup membership (e.g., religion, residence) can be
explicitly modeled. This use of subcohorts, defined by observed stratification
in individual level data, controls further
analysis for structural subcohort differences. Thus, the next issue faced is identifying the variables (or population subcohorts) which would most directly
control for social factors influencing individual fertility experience and change.

At this stage of our database development we are restricted to the investigation of a few significant variables. To
identify fertility influences within the
population we conducted a multivariate
categorical, or log-linear (Goodman,
1978), analysis which included six varia

bles: (1) religious affiliation or commitment, (2) residential status distinguishing among settled and mobile
populations in central and noncentral
Utah, (3) completed fertility, (4) age of
the wife at marriage, (5) age of the
mother at the birth of the last child, and
(6) mother’s birth cohort. This analysis
(Mineau et al., 1984) identified four distinctive subcohorts within the population, using two dichotomous variables of
religious commitment and residential
history. These four subcohort definitions are used to specify known structural variations within our simulation
analysis.

Religious commitment had two major subgroups: (a) Endowed and (b)
Non-Endowed. The Endowed have experienced the two religious rites of baptism and endowment in the LDS
(Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints) church. Baptism typically occurs
at age eight; endowment normally takes
place early in adulthood and must be
preceded by baptism. For an adult who
converts to the LDS church, these rites
could be at much older ages. The NonEndowed are those who lack both rites
or those who lack only the endowment
rite. Included in this category are those
with only partial association with the
LDS church, the nonactive Mormons,
and non-Mormons. The Endowed represent those individuals most highly
committed to the LDS church while the
Non-Endowed represent a group with
less (or no) commitment to the LDS
church.

Residential history used the place of
residence and length of residence from

data associated with the place of birth?
of the first and last child in the family.
With these data, we identified two
groups: (a) settled/central-area residents, those families in which both the
first and last child were born in the central Mormon settlement areas of Utah
Territory, now Salt Lake County, Utah
County, and Weber County’ (hereafter
for simplicity identified as the Central
Area subcohort). (b) mobile/noncentral-area residents, those families who
either experienced both first and last
births in an agricultural-settlement area,
or were residentially mobile in that first
and last birth were not both in the central area. This category includes families
who began their childbearing before
moving to Utah (hereafter identified as
the Noncentral Areas subcohort). The
residential exposure variable may be
conceived as a proxy measure of modernization associated with urbanization,
reflecting therefore the type of macrolevel variable presumed to cause a fall in
marital fertility in traditional fertility
transition theory.

3Family group sheets used in our study record
city, county, state, and country of birth for each
family member.

‘It is inappropriate to identify the central areas
as purely urban because of the early concentration
of agricultural activities even in these areas. Also
because families who migrate out and return
would be included in this definition of settled central, we looked at all other children’s birthplaces.
For 90.43 per cent of settled central families, all
children with a recorded birthplace were born in
the central area; 4.87 per cent had one birth outside, 2.31 per cent had two, and 2.4 per cent had
three or more births outside. Because the movement of families with larger numbers of children
are more likely to be recorded, we specified this by
number of children ever born. For families with 1
to 3, 4 to 6, 7 to 9, 10 to 12, and 13 or more children, 98.5 per cent, 90.6 per cent, 87.3 per cent,
82.9 per cent, and 81.4 per cent (respectively) had
no outside births. Thus, the stable/central category
does represent a quite consistent living pattern;
even for the largest families, 91.75 per cent have 11
or more births in the central area.

Social Biology

These two variables provided us with
the most parsimonious explanation of
the variations in subcohort levels of fertility. Therefore, the next step in our
analysis is to use measured and/or estimated parametric values for the proximate determinants of fertility and fertility control within the four significant
subcohorts to model the Utah fertility
transition.

In summary, in this paper, we use the
Bongaarts macrosimulation model
(1976) which enables us to include subcohort specifications of proximate fertility deteminants to reproduce the observed fertility transition. Because
macrosimulation methods employ a
somewhat different approach to the
analysis of the fertility transition, we
first present alternate methods to examine the presumed emergence of rational
fertility limitation within families which
will provide a basis for comparison with
other studies. This brief analysis is also a
necessary prelude to specifying simulation assumptions. We then present the
results of the macrosimulation enabling
us to model the shifts in proximate determinants of fertility among these subcohorts of the population.

RESULTS

THE DECLINE IN LEVELS OF MARITAL
FERTILITY

In this section we analyze fertility
change within our four population subcohorts; our focus is on the decline in
levels of marital fertility. Only summary
tables and figures are presented. More
detailed tabulations are available on request.

In the following results, we employ
two different measures of fertility—
period and cohort. The publication of

different indicators serves two purposes. First, for researchers interested
in comparing our reported rates of fertility change with other populations, the
presentation of both measures increases
the likelihood that they will find in this
paper a measure which can be computed
and compared with data available from
their own sources. Secondly, the consistency of the trends among the various
subcohorts and measures assures that
the observed patterns of fertility change
are not an artifact of a particular measurement method.

In Table 1 we present summary data
on fertility levels and proportionate
change over time for children ever born
(cohort) and marital total fertility rates
(period). The data are graphically presented in Figures 1 and 2. The top panel
of Table 1 contains data on children ever
born (CEB) for the mother’s birth cohorts 1840-44 and 1895-99 within each
of our four subconorts. The first cohort

This cohort also reflects an increase in
levels of fertility over previous cohorts,
consistent with other studies which note
a rise in fertility levels during initial
stages of modernization (Mosk, 1981;
Romaniuk, 1980).° Three of the subcohorts peak simultaneously in 1840-44,

the smallest proportionate change
among our four subcohorts. Nevertheless, by the time the 1895-99 cohorts
have completed their childbearing, the
Noncentral Area residents have the
highest fertility levels, and religious
commitment appears to have little, if
any, effect. The Endowed and the NonEndowed have roughly the same fertility levels within the same residence
classes. The proportionate decline is approximately equal for the Central Area
residents, although the more committed—the Endowed—start at a higher
level, and the last subcohort has a somewhat higher CEB level (4.18) than the
last birth cohort among the NonEndowed, Central Area residents
(3.81). These data would suggest that
the influence of exposure to the more

time has a greater impact on fertility

In the second panel of Table 1 we

subsequent) who would have been completing their childbearing during our observation period. We also terminate our

the least among the Noncentral Area
subcohorts. Considering only MTFR’s
computed across the age range 20-49,
the Endowed/Noncentral residents
maintain the highest level of fertility,
and the Non-Endowed/Central residents maintain the lowest. Within the
two types of residential areas, the Endowed have higher fertility than the
Non-endowed; within religious commitment groups, the Central Area residents
have lower fertility than the Noncentral
Area residents. Of more importance,
however, is the observation that the proportionate rate of change is about equal
for the two religious commitment
groups within each of the two residential
area groups.

The importance of the subcohort
time series data should be obvious.
Cross-sectional data would suggest that
religious commitment and residential
area exposure have important independent effects on fertility levels. Yet the
changes over the thirty years of period
data indicate that the religious effect is
mediated by the exposure to community
residential-area influences.’ One also
notes an important factor by comparing
the period and cohort rates. The women
born in 1895-99 are only commencing
their childbearing during 1915~19 and
do not terminate their childbearing until
the period marked approximately by the
outbreak of World War II, experiencing
the later years of childbearing during the
great Depression when fertility rates
throughout the United States were very
low. Therefore, the women born during
1895-99 who were Endowed and lived
in Noncentral Areas must have limited
their childbearing at a fairly substantial

living among the LDS are discussed by DeHart,

achieve a CEB approximately equal to
that observed for the Non-Endowed,
Noncentral Area residents.®

The results of this section go somewhat beyond traditional analyses of fertility levels in that they examine fertility
changes within empirically-derived population subgroups. However, as noted
above, the fertility indices presented do
not adequately examine the age patterns
of fertility or the parity-dependent nature of fertility changes. In the next section we present a macrosimulation approach to resolving these difficulties.

SIMULATION PROCEDURES AND RESULTS

The methods and results presented in
this section extend earlier simulations of
the natural fertility period of the Mormon population to encompass the significant groups and process involved in
the transition to fertility control. As in
previous simulations of age-specific fertility rates during the natural fertility
period (Willigan et al., 1982), the simuJation model used was Bongaarts’
(1976). One reason for selecting the
Bongaarts model over others (Leridon,
1977; Crafts and Ireland, 1975) is its
ability to incorporate population subcohorts over the course of the fertility transition.

The Bongaarts model requires a
number of input parameters in estimating the distribution of birth intervals,
the family-building pattern of marriageduration-specific births, and finally the
age-order-specific birth rates. A major
*The somewhat greater decline among the two
Endowed groups for the MTFR for age groups 1549 may well be due to declining rates of marriage
for young (15-19) highly committed LDS women,
arising from a shift toward a greater use of young
males as missionaries, thus creating a temporary
constriction on the marriage market.

ity of these parameters, including the
proportion ever marrying and remarrying, initial and mean age of marriage,
age-specific divorce and widowhood
rates, fecundability and risks of spontaneous abortion, and mean infecundability associated with sterility, spontaneous
abortion, and the post-partum period,
have been previously presented for birth
cohorts of Mormon women born between 1840 and 1899, and the sensitivity
of the model to these estimates assessed
(Willigan et al., 1982). However, earlier
simulation analysis was restricted to a
natural fertility case and all contraceptive parameters were artificially given
null valves. In the present effort, several
additional parameters necessary to simulate the transition to patterns of fertility control are provided, and simulation
curves are fitted for the fertility transition following the 1860 birth cohort.

In this analysis, the four structural
subcohorts above are integrated into the
Bongaarts model through empirically
estimating the proportionate size of
each subcohort in each of the five-year
birth cohorts between 1840 and 1899.
For each subcohort entered in the simulation model, three additional parameters are needed to specify contraceptive
use and portray the transition to control:
contraceptive efficacy, parity at which
contraceptive use is initiated, and maximum parity for members of the subcohort.

Following Bongaarts, contraceptive
efficacy was assumed equal across all
subcohorts, and estimates were derived
by adjusting the overall level of efficacy
to adequately reproduce observed rates.
In his initial presentation of the simulation model, Bongaarts referred to the
birth order at which this contraceptive
efficacy was initiated as the ‘desired
family size.” Because this terminology is
Vol. 31, No. 1-2

inconsistent with the possibility of contraceptive spacing, we have substituted
the more descriptive phrase, “‘parity at
which contraceptive use is initiated.”
This parameter was estimated as a simple adjustment of average children ever
born within the four subcohorts. Because the analysis of fertility levels in
each of the four subcohorts suggested
roughly parallel declines (Figures la and
1b), it was assumed that mean children
4D
=ever born for the four subgroups ade“quately captured differences in overall
Ssubgroup /evels of fertility, for example,
the shift from religious commitment to
Aurban exposure as the principal factor
codifferentiating cross-sectional fertility
olevels. Parallel adjustments of the mean
cSCEB were then applied in each subcohort to obtain estimates of the parity of
racontraceptive initiation. A single con&stant parity was subtracted from average
‘SCEB in all subgroups of the population
until a fit was obtained (e.g., average
SCEB less two).
In the onginal Bongaarts model it
owas also assumed that the maximum
‘<parity for any woman was simply three
“births beyond the parity at which she iniStiated contraception. While this as“gsumption has proved plausible for popuSlations where contraception is absent or
Eminimal (Willigan et al., 1982; BonAgaarts, 1976), it is clearly not suited to
fertility-limiting populations where contraceptive spacing may be utilized or
where highly variable childbearing patterns are present. Since the assumption
was initially incapable of simulating the
transition in the Mormon population,
the Bongaarts model was modified to allow input of the maximum parity as a parameter for each subcohort. The maximum parity was then estimated in a
similar manner to the initial contracepting birth order by adding a constant par

ity to the average children ever born in
each subcohort until a fit was obtained,
again, based upon the apparently parallel decline in fertility levels (Figures 1a
and 1b).

For example, in the 1870~74 birth cohort, those who were committed to the
Mormon religion (Endowed) and resided in the Central Areas at both first
and last births had mean number of children ever born of 6.61; those who were
Endowed and Noncentral Area residents had a mean CEB of 7.58; those
non-Endowed and residing in the Central Area had a mean CEB of 5.99; and
the Non-Endowed, Noncentral area
residents had a mean CEB of 7.32. Initial simulation trials suggested a low
level of contraceptive efficacy (0.55 per
cent) initiated at a relatively early parity. The best fit of observed fertility rates
was then obtained by setting initial contracepting parities for the four subcohorts to five births prior to mean CEB
(which was 2, 3, 1, 2, respectively) and
maximum parity to ten births greater
than initiation of contraception (12, 13,
11, 12, respectively). Thus the results
for the 1870-74 birth cohort suggest a
low-level contraceptive efficacy spread
over a wide range of parities. In contrast, for the 1890-94 birth cohort, estimated contraceptive efficacy is 80 per
cent, introduced at three births prior to
mean CEB and with a maximum parity
of six births beyond initiation of contraception. These changes indicate an increasing limitation of fertility as contraceptive efficacy increased and a wider
range of contraceptive spacing than anticipated by the original Bongaarts
model.

The parameters which were newly
specified to fit the simulation to fertility
control are presented in Table 2 for all
subgroups across the birth cohorts simu

previous simulation efforts (Table 4,

for the changing fertility trends as shown

between birth cohorts. While the rates
of efficacy may be slightly inflated due to
more incomplete genealogical recording
of still living individuals, this bias would
affect only the very latest cohorts presented and likely only to a small degree.

One should not, however, be misled
by the magnitudes of the estimated contraceptive efficacies. Leridon (1977) has
suggested a contraceptive efficacy of 50
per cent may be entirely compatible
with a natural fertility schedule if it does
not represent parity-dependent control.
Vol. 31, No. 1-2

A contraceptive efficacy of 50 per cent
implies that one-half of the fecund
women who would have conceived may
avoid conception for one month, onefourth for two months, only 12.5 per
cent for three months, and so on. The
resultant increases in mean birth intervals would then be limited to only several months. Second, to the extent that
our simulation estimates are valid, the
p, results of Figures 2a and 2b suggest that
= the Mormon population initially experi“enced low-level contraceptive use
spread over a wide parity range. Howo ever, the population radically shifted to
Aa high-efficacy pattern of limitation
se within an extremely short time span. It is

count for the changes observed. The
clear suggestion of these results is that
the Utah fertility transition was a result
of a fundamental behavioral shift toward fertility limitation which emerged
at about the same time among different
subgroups within the society with different initial levels of fertility.

In any use of simulation models it is
possible to introduce artificial results
through the method chosen to fit simulation parameters. The relatively uniform
decrease in initial contracepting parities
and maximum parities (Figures 3 and 4)
might be suspected to be a result of the
way in which these parameters were fit.
Rather than subtracting or adding constant parities from the mean completed
family size of all four subcohorts simultaneously, one might attempt to fit each
subcohort individually. However, centering limitation parameters upon mean
CEB encompasses any shifts in the role
of subcohorts over the course of the
transition (i.e., the increasing role of
modernization). And, as noted above,

the relatively parallel declines in fertility
levels of the four subcohorts (Figures 1a
and 1b) appear to substantiate largely
uniform longitudinal adoption of fertility limitation in achieving these fertility
levels. To further verify the relatively
uniform adoption of fertility limitation
within the four subcohorts, marital] agespecific fertility rates are used to calculate the indices of m and M which are
presented in Table 3.° Coale and Trussell suggest that the parameter m indicates the degree of control of marital
fertility while M is a scale factor for the
underlying level of fertility. These estimates are readily interpretable if one
observes a series over time. “For exam
*These indices have been calculated based on
MASER using ages 20-24 . . . 45-59 and regressing over ages 20 to 44. A computer program is
available in Coale and Trussell (19782) and allows
mand M to be estimated by ordinary least squares.

ple, if one observes a monotonic rise in
m over time from —0.08 to 1.0, then an
estimate of 0.2 in this sequence would
evidence control” (Coale and Trussell,
1978, p. 205). The change in m values
across the birth cohorts substantiates
the dramatic and largely uniform onset
of fertility limitation portrayed by simulation results.

The m values as indices of control
simply provide complementary evidence. All four subcohorts evidence
consistent increases in the values of mm
over time. The Non-Endowed, Central
Area residents appear to achieve a level
of control somewhat earlier than other
groups and evidence the greatest
amount of change in the m values
(1.319). The Endowed, Central Area
subcohort also evidences a substantial
increase in m (0.924). Consistent with
the changes in CEB and MTFR, the
changes in the levels of control are

Non-Endowed, Central Area residents;
and maximum birth order is generally

an additional 312 sensitivity analysis trials were performed, altering parameter
values and examining the effects of
these alterations.

The apparent uniqueness of solutions

analysis continues to assume a parallelism in the use of contraception within

ported assumption the simulation admittedly degenerates into an infinite
number of plausible solutions. However, given this specification, it 1s possible to support the fitted values obtained
for other simulation parameters within
subcohorts. In Table 4 the sensitivity
analysis results for the 1885-89 birth cohort are presented. In this analysis, contraceptive efficacy was varied by 20 per
cent and both parity of initial contraceptive use and maximum parity were increased or decreased by two births.
Since hypothetical rates without denominator populations are produced by the
simulation, a paired f-test was used to
compare the simulated and observed
fertility rates for each change of parameters.

In addition to our fitted simulation

 

(t= —0.39), three other parameter configurations fit without significant differences. However, two of these possible
solutions (—0.23, 0.42), with maximum
parity decreased by two and contraceptive efficacy decreased by 20 per cent,
are inadmissible. For these specifications, the maximum birth orders of the
four subcohorts in Table 2 would be
clearly understated, approximately one
birth beyond the average number of
births. The third possible fit (0.69)
results from simply increasing maximum
parity by two births. However, this fit is
no better than that provided by the parameters of Table 2. If, however, this solution were adopted, the impact on our
results is simply to increase the range of
births over which contraception is used.

population groups by being composed
largely of members or ancestors of
members of the LDS church which has
been correctly identified as a pronatalist
church with notably high levels of fertility. The evidence which we have presented in this paper clearly indicates that
during the early periods of observation,
noted as the period of natural fertility,
commitment to a pronatalist religion
may be related to differences in levels of
fertility, but not longitudinal patterns of
fertility decline. By the end of our observation period, variables more traditionally associated with the fertility transition in Western Europe, consistent
long-term secularization and exposure
to urban influences, appear to be more
important determinants of crosssectional fertility levels and longitudinal
changes in fertility levels among our
four subcohorts. Consequently, the utility of the data base for the analysis of an
observed “fertility transition” enables
us to examine certain of the criticisms of
the fertility transition arguments based
to date largely on analysis of European
populations.

Before considering the implications
of our findings, it is useful to recapitulate. Taking into account the classical
transition theory argument that the fertility transition ‘“‘ought” to be related to
changes in modernization variables such
as urbanization, and recognizing that
previous research has demonstrated
that areas which were culturally similar
moved together in changing fertility, we
have examined the fertility changes
among four distinctive subcohorts in our
population distinguished in terms of religious commitment and exposure to
central, urban areas. Examination of
changes in CEB and MTFR indicates
that within a relatively brief period of
time, the changes in levels of fertility

 

Social Biology

among these four subcohorts were substantial and dramatic. Over 12 five-year
birth cohorts, the levels of CEB decreased between 21.5 and 54.0 per cent.
Over a period of thirty years the MTFR
period rates declined between 22.5 and
29.7 per cent. Changes in m values were
also consistent. All four subcohorts
adopted a pattern of increasing fertility
limitation at about the same time, and
the increase in control suggested by increasing magnitudes of m was also substantial, with some variation among our
four subcohorts. Primary differences in
levels of fertility observed among natural fertility cohorts shifted from religious
to urban differences over the course of
the transition, but were small compared
to the remarkable similarity in the timing of the adoption of control within
subcohorts and the uninterrupted trend
of increasing fertility limitation.

The significance of our use of the
Bongaart’s macrosimulation is that it
enables us to analyze several proximate
determinants of fertility simultaneously
and to introduce contraceptive parameters for each of the four subcohorts separately while controlling for changes in
the structural composition of the population. This analysis allows us to confirm
that the observed pattern of fertility for
the population of once-married females
as a whole can only be reproduced by
taking into account these three parameters and their values for the four subcohorts. This analysis also suggests that
contraceptive parity-dependent spacing
may have played a major role in the
Utah fertility transition. Consequently,
we are confident that the changes in fertility represent a significant behavioral
shift reflecting dramatically increasing
parity-dependent control of fertility
within marriages. In addition, our simulation of fertility behavior strongly sug
 
Vol. 31, No. 1-2

gests a significant onset of both birth
spacing and fertility truncation over the
course of this transition.

The emergence of the fertility transition among our western, frontier population may appear to have been somewhat later than the emergence of control
among midwestern and eastern U.S.
populations from comparisons with aggregated U.S. data (Caldwell, 1981, p.
17; Coale and Zelnik, 1963). But, the

‘o delay in the decline in this region should
enot be attributed simply to the impact of
othe LDS church. High levels of fertility
E during initial periods of agricultural set2 tlement in frontier regions, followed by
Oa subsequent decline, is consistent with
<Easterlin’s studies of agricultural re~- gions elsewhere in the United States
—(Easterlin, 1976), and the generally
“later economic integration of Utah with
the rest of the country. The initially high
levels of fertility observed among the
natural fertility cohorts may have been
+= partially influenced by religious factors;
pbut once the population began to adopt
control, change in fertility levels in our
.2two religious groups was remarkably
~ Similar within residential categories.
2 It is important to distinguish among
y three aspects of the increasing control
'¥ observed in this study: timing of adop< tion of control, rate of decline in fertilZ ity, and resulting fertility levels. While
A all four groups began to limit fertility at
about the same time with largely similar
rates of fertility decline, regardless of religious commitment or exposure to different types of residential areas, the
level of control was generally always
greater for women who experienced all
of their childbearing in the central urban
areas, suggesting that “modernization”
variables may have some impact on the
adoption of fertility limitation. This impact arises not from some threshold

Fertility Limitation

157

level of urbanization, for example, but
rather from the character and intensity
of the experience of the population.
When examining fertility differences
among urban and nonurban populations
at different points in time over which
one observes an increasing growth of the
urban population, one should remember that the urban population is composed of two very different groups. It is
composed of the permanent residents as
well as the migrants who add to the rate
of urbanization. Only through the utilization of microlevel data which enables
one to distinguish among subgroups of
the population in terms of length of exposure to “modernizing-urban-secular”’
influences is it justifiable to conclude
that some of the traditional variables associated with classified transition theory
may have an additive effect on the magnitude if not the timing of the fertility
transition. Consequently seeking to relate more aggregate “threshold values”
of modernization or other aggregate
level socioeconomic measures to fertility measures may be an inappropriate
research strategy for investigating
individual-level adaptations to socioeconomic environments.

While the differences which we note
in the levels of fertility among our residential groups are interesting, of more
importance is the absence of any significant differences in the timing and progress of control. We are still left with the
problem of explaining why the initiation
of control appears at about the same
time and proceeds at roughly the same
rate among four very different subcohorts with different levels of religious
commitment and different levels of exposure to urban commercial areas. At a
minimum, however, we can conclude
that the adoption of control was not simply a new (or renewed) innovation by

one subcohort and later diffused among
other subcohorts. Yet, our search for
more comprehensive explanations
needs to be expanded to examine more
systematically the organization of agricultural and economic interactions, the
exposure and intensity of educational
experiences, as well as changes in values
and ideologies which may affect family
organization and structure within subcohorts of the population over the course
of the fertility transition.
