ABSTRACT: Data on 8,308 menstrual cycles from 1,740 South Indian women prospectively
recorded were analyzed to identify the effect of age on menstrual cycle length. The distribution
was skewed to the right with the mean (SD) cycle length of 31.8 (6.7) days. The range of 25-40
days constituted 10-82 per cent of menstrual cycle lengths. In no age group did 28-day cycles
occur in more than 9 per cent of women. Variability as measured by the standard deviation was
high among those below 19 years of age, stabilized during 25-39 years, and then increased in
women aged 40 years or more. The findings are discussed in the light of other studies and possible

implications in fertility control programs.

Despite a number of statistical studies, there still remains considerable
lack of agreement on the average
length of human menstrual cycles, the
extent of variability, and its correlates.
The notion of a 28-day cycle arose
mainly from hospital case records and
interviews with patients (Chiazze et
al., 1968). Menstrual cycles described
retrospectively with no written documentation pose problems of validation
(Collett et al., 1954; Chiazze et al.,
1968; Matsumoto, 1963; Vollman,
1966; Treloar, 1972). Collett et al.
(1954) have used Basal Body Temperature (BBT) as the means of identifying the day of ovulation and reported
that median cycle length was close to
28 days at all ages. The mode fell from
30 days in the youngest group to 25
days in the oldest. Vollman (1966)
studied 12,571 menstrual cycles covering the entire reproductive period of
546 women and found that following
menarche, 45 per cent of the BBT
records are monophasic with short pre
menstrual phases of 3 to 10 days duration. This study had presented the
statistics of premenstrual phases as follicular and juteal phases.

The success of the rhythm or natural
family planning method depends on accurate knowledge of variations in the
menstrual cycle of the user, allowing
for the unsafe period to be avoided.
The need for precise information on
menstrual phenomena has increased as
a result of the introduction of steroid
hormones and the IUD for contraception. Some of the side effects of both of
these methods of contraception relate
to menstruation, and it has become apparent that there are gaps in basic
knowledge of the “normal” pattern in
the general population. A more reasonable study procedure would involve
data collected prospectively and taken
from calendar records of women with
adequate supervision (WHO, 1969). In
this paper, one such study is reported,
and the association between age and
menstrual cycle length described.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data for the present investigation
were obtained from a community survey done during 1969 through 1974 on
several aspects of human reproduction. The population samples for this
research were taken from the district of
North Arcot in Tamil Nadu, India. The
details of the sampling plan were described elsewhere (Rao and Inbaraj,
1977). All women were interviewed
prospectively at home every five weeks
about their menstrual histories, dates
of initiation and termination of each
menstrual period, the amount of flow,
and complaints, if any. Out of three rural and two urban areas, one rural and
one urban area were randomly selected
for the present research on menstrual
patterns. This subset provided 1,740
women on whom details of 4 to 5
consecutive cycles are included in the
analysis.

RESULTS

Frequency distribution by age of
women included in this study is presented in Table 1. Intra-woman menstrual cycle length variation is presented according to age of women in
Table 2. The standard deviation was

nearly 5—6 days in extreme groups and
nearly 3 days for the rest (Jeyaseelan,
1988). Taking into account the mean of
4 to 5 consecutive cycles per woman
studied, the descriptive statistics on
menstrual cycle length by age of
women are shown in Table 3. The
mean was 31.2 (3.2) days. Sixty per
cent of the women have mean cycle
lengths between 25 and 31 days and 39
per cent, more than 32 days. From the
table, it is clear that the distribution of
cycle lengths is skewed to the right.

Frequency distribution and descriptive statistics of cycle lengths according
to age of women for all 8,308 cycle
lengths are shown in Table 4. The
mean (SD) of 8,308 cycle lengths was
31.8 (6.7) days. The range of 25~40
days cycle length constituted 10-82 per
cent. The modal frequency for the
total distribution was 30 days. Fortyseven per cent of cycle lengths were 25
to 31 days and 43 per cent were more
than 31 days. Younger age-groups
have longer cycle lengths as compared
to others. These findings confirm the
results from Table 3.

DISCUSSION

The present study collected data
prospectively to ascertain actual dates

of menstruation as done by Chiazze et
al. (1968) and Treloar (1973). Although the sample included only currently married women, omitting those
unmarried or not living with their husbands, such women constituted less
than 1 per cent in the reproductive age
group (Richard and Rao, 1987). The

relevant information was collected
through home visits once every 5
weeks by female interviewers who
were fluent in the local language and
who had undergone the necessary
training. Although the women were illiterate, they were fairly conversant
with the local almanac and the various
lunar phases, each of which has specific
religious significance. During menstruation also, various ritualistic practices
are observed. Thus, it was not too difficult to ascertain the beginning and
ending dates of menstrual flow in relation to the lunar calendar. From this,
the transcription was made to the English calendar.

Mean cycle length of nearly 32 days
is significantly different from the studies reported earlier (Chiazze et al.,

1968; Treloar, 1973). The range of
25-31 days contributed 47 per cent,
whereas this range was reported by 77
per cent in the Chiazze et al. (1968)
study. A longitudinal interpretation of
these data implied that menstrual histories were quite variable during early
years following menarche with the
variability declining during the main
reproductive years and then increasing
again aS menopause was approached.
Since the range of 25-40 days constituted a higher per cent (10-82), we
concluded it appropriate to assume the
range of 25-40 days as normal. In Japan, Matsumoto (1963) concluded
25~38 days as normal which covered
10-90 per cent, and the mean (SD) cycle length was 30.96 (6.75) days. From
this study we conclude that the conventional statement of 28 days is a myth,
especially in developing countries.
Thus the clinical decision-making
process of deciding the abnormal cycle

based on 28 days cycle length should be
reconsidered. As the variation of menstrual cycle length is considered an important sign for women’s health problems, the factors associated with such
should be determined. Further results
from Vellore on these aspects will be
reported in subsequent publications.
