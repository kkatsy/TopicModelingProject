Family Planning and the Reduction of Fertility
and Ilegitimacy: A Preliminary Report

on a Rural Southern Program*

The potential contribution of organized
family-planning programs to fertility decline
and the reduction of population growth is
the subject of a “lively debate,” as Potter
and his colleagues (1968) have observed,
among demographers, health workers, and
policy makers (Berelson, 1967; Davis, 1967;
Hauser, 1967; Notestein, 1967). While the
population problem in developing countries
differs both in magnitude and urgency from
the United States, the same basic challenges
have been addressed to the validity of assigning priority to family-planning efforts
at home and abroad.

Drawing on their experience in Taiwan
and Korea, Potter, Freedman, and Chow
(1968) have marshalled selective documentation of both increased birth control practice and decreased fertility as a result of
these programs, refuting “the argument that
the program is trivial because the participants are too old, too few, or too poorly
motivated to practice contraception with
any persistence or with any significant effect
on fertility” (p. 852).

* An earlier version of this paper was presented

before the American Public Health Association, Detroit, November, 1968.

In the United States, the impact of organized family-planning programs on fertility patterns has been difficult to measure
because these programs have usually served
only small segments of the population in
large metropolitan areas where it is difficult
to assess the effect of migration and changing age composition (Bogue, 1965). Nevertheless, the subject is of considerable significance, given recent estimates of the
magnitude of unwanted fertility ranging
from a minimum of 450,000 births annually
among poor and near-poor couples (Campbell, 1968) to a minimum of 850,000 annually for all couples in the United States
(Jaffee and Guttmacher, 1968).

This paper presents data collected in a
family-planning research and demonstration program initiated in a rural southern
parish (county) in 1965. The program is
continuing, and the data presented here
must be regarded as preliminary. Nevertheless, changes have been observed in both
fertility and illegitimacy trends in this parish since the program began, and the possible relationship of these changes to the
family-planning program can at least be
suggested.

Apart from the possible demographic significance, there are other valid reasons for
the detailed evaluation of the impact of
organized family-planning programs in the
United States. The yearly increase in the
number of out-of-wedlock births since 1940
(Clague and Ventura, 1968) has evoked
widespread concern both among the general
public and various professional groups.
The problem is of particular importance
to health workers because out-of-wedlock
births are associated with a higher incidence
of maternal death, stillbirth, infant death,
and prematurity. Moreover, the early initiation of childbearing is associated both with

 

Social Biology

nature of these problems and expanded support of programs which hold promise of reducing their incidence.

BACKGROUND

The Lincoln Parish Family Planning
Program was initiated as a research and
demonstration program for family-planning
and population studies in a rural county
of Louisiana in September, 1965. A survey
was carried out on a probability sample of
all women who had experienced a reproductive event and declared Lincoln Parish
as their place of residence from 1960 through
1964. The husbands of these women were

high rates of premarital conception and with
significantly lower ultimate income levels
for the family (Freedman and Coombs,
1966). This relationship would appear to
hold whether or not the conception is subsequently legitimized by marriage (Pakter
and Nelson, 1965). Children born out of
wedlock also are often stigmatized by society, do not relate to a male figure in their
early years, and generally have more chance
of being handicapped in both their physical
and emotional development. For these reasons, illegitimacy and premarital conception
are national health and social problems
of considerable magnitude. However, the
health problems alone provide ample justification for broader investigation into the

also studied (Beasley and Parrish, 1968).
Simultaneously, the demographic characteristics of Lincoln Parish and the four surrounding parishes, Bienville, Claiborne,
Jackson, and Union, were evaluated. Selected findings from the evaluation are presented in Table 1. We concluded that
Lincoln Parish and the four surrounding
parishes have many characteristics which
are similar both to each other and to other
rural counties in the southern United States.
While the term “‘control]”’ cannot be used in
the classical sense in referring to the four
surrounding parishes, these parishes did approximate as near a control situation as
could be achieved in a field experiment of
this kind. Henceforth, we will refer to

Lincoln Parish as the study parish and the
four surrounding parishes as the control
parishes.

The selection of a study parish as the site
for the pilot family-planning program was
governed by the following criteria:

1. The parish should have fertility and familyplanning problems similar to those in most
non-Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area
counties in the south.

2. It should contain a complete governmental
unit and a population of 25,000 to 50,000,
with no city having a population greater
than 20,000.

3. Thirty to sixty per cent of its population

should be nonwhite.

. Its crude birthrate should be above 20.

. Some medical personnel and facilities should
be available as well as public and private sector medical personnel willing to cooperate in
the program.

6. The medical personnel and facilities available, both public and private, should not be
greatly dissimilar to those actually or potentially available in other rural southern counties.

7. The study parish should be surrounded by
other parishes with similar mechanisms for
the provision of health care.

come of less than $3,000. As Table 2 shows,
the population in the study parish and in
most of the control parishes increased from
1960 to 1966, rather than decreased, with
the largest increase occurring in the study
parish,

Table 3 depicts estimates of the general
fertility rates for the five parishes. In 1960,
Lincoln Parish had the lowest general fertility rate. The 1966 estimates indicate that
in these parishes, as in the rest of the United
States, there has been a decrease in fertility
rates.

Therefore, we judged the five parishes
were similar enough in their major characteristics to yield comparative data of interest, particularly since the main change
that has occurred since 1965 in the provision of health care in these parishes has
been the implementation of the Family
Planning Demonstration Program in Lincoln Parish. Family-planning services are
available in the four control parishes but

It is our belief that Lincoln Parish and
the four surrounding parishes met these
criteria judged to be essential for the conduct of the research and demonstration
program. There were no remarkably dissimilar characteristics noted in regard to
ethnic distribution, birth rate, median family income, or per cent of families with in

to Lincoln Parish.

The survey of Lincoln Parish families
revealed a marked lack of information about
the most elemental aspects of reproduction
among the lower socioeconomic group. Only
about 30% of the lower socioeconomic families had any meaningful understanding of

human reproduction, beyond the fact that
intercourse and pregnancy are related, as
compared with 86% of upper socioeconomic
group respondents. However, more than
83% of the lower socioeconomic group felt
that a couple has a right to decide for themselves the number and timing of their children, and 84% expressed a desire for more
information about family-planning methods.
It is also of interest that around 70% of the
middle socioeconomic group and 40% of
the upper socioeconomic group also wanted
more family-planning information. The
main reason given by families not desiring
this type of information in the middle and

upper socioeconomic group was that 90%
reported they were already practicing some
acceptable form of family planning.

In summary, the preliminary survey
indicated that the lower socioeconomic
group, depending primarily upon tax-supported facilities for medical care and lacking
information about reproductive physiology
and contraceptive methods, did have a
strong feeling that a couple had a right to
decide for themselves the number and timing of their children and were highly interested in additional family-planning information and services. It did not seem that any
major motivational blocks existed among
the lower socioeconomic group to prevent
their acceptance of family-planning services.

The design of the program, therefore, was

 

Social Biology

premised on the hypothesis that the provision of adequate information and services
would result in a high level of utilization
by lower socioeconomic couples. The emphasis in designing the program was on
identifying, contacting, and educating the
target population, providing adequate family-planning services, and developing a follow-up system appropriate for the maintenance of the patient population.

Prior to inaugurating full-scale operations, the medical, religious, educational,
political, dnd civic leaders of the area were
systematically contacted and advised of the
need for a family-planning clinic. The final
principles of operation of the program, including a policy prohibiting services to
women who have not been married or pregnant, were governed by the agreements
reached with these groups.

THE PROGRAM

Services and information were made available on September 10, 1965 to Lincoln Parish residents who met the criteria defining
medical indigency. This clinic, the first family-planning clinic in Louisiana, is located
in the Lincoln Parish Public Health Unit
in Ruston. The plan was to identify and
offer services to all medically indigent females of reproductive age in need of family-planning services. However, since there
was no established way of identifying these
women, a system was developed to identify,
contact, and follow-up patients.

The first step was to identify the women
by name and address. This was accomplished through the use of birth certificate
information furnished by the Louisiana
State Department of Health and by delivery
record information furnished by the three
charity hospitals where 95% of the medically
Indigent women in Lincoln Parish deliver
their babies. This method left unidentified
a segment of the medically indigent population of reproductive age, the size of which
we had no way of determining at that time.

Vol. 16, No. 3

The second step was to locate the women
identified and to determine how many of
them were available to participate in a
family-planning program. The women were
contacted according to the following priorities:

1. Current postpartum women.

2. High-risk women.!
3. Low-risk women.?

The overall design of the program has been
described in detail in a previous report
(Beasley and Parrish, 1968).

Although initiated in September, 1965,
the program was in the developmental stage
until March 1, 1966. All of the identifiable
patients in the categories described above
were contacted by July 12, 1967, and the
results through that date are presented here.
Any effect of the family planning program
upon fertility and illegitimacy trends would
therefore be reflected at the earliest in the
calendar year 1967.

We identified a total of 1,055 medically
indigent patients who had a vital event registered between January 1, 1960 and July
12, 1967 (Table 4). An attempt was made
to reach each potential patient by personal
contact. Approximately 32% were not available to participate in the program because
they had been surgically sterilized, were
pregnant, had moved from the parish, could
not be located, or were negative toward
family planning. However, 719 women
(68%) were both identifiable and available,
and 412 of them accepted an appointment
and attended the clinic. This constituted
an acceptance rate of more than 57% of
the identifiable and available patients who
were offered an appointment at the clinic.

1 The high-risk criteria are: (1) parity 6 or more;
(2) latest delivery occurred out of wedlock; (3) history of stillbirth; (4) one or more children born alive
now dead; (5) less than 17 or over 39 years of age;

(6) latest delivery a multiple birth; and (7) latest
delivery premature.

2 The low-risk group consists of the members of
the identifiable medically indigent population who
have not been classified as high-risk.

Table 5 depicts some of the characteristics of the total universe of 1,055 identifiable medically indigent women. Three hundred ninety-six were judged to be low-risk
patients, and 659, or 62.5%, high-risk patients. Of all the women in the identifiable
medically indigent universe, 349 had experienced an illegitimate birth.

In addition to the program’s efforts to
contact identifiable prospective patients directly, some nonidentifiable patients were
referred to the clinic from other agencies
and by friends or relatives who had attended
the clinic. Table 6 shows that the total
number of referrals from all outside sources
was 74, of whom 60 attended the clinic.

As indicated in Table 7, 793 patients were

719 identified by the contact system and
74 referred from outside the system. Of
these, 472 or 60% attended and participated
in the program during the time period noted.
The remaining 321 patients were contacted
and either did not keep their appointments
or refused appointments.

Social Biology

Thus, of all patients who attended the
clinic during this period, only 12% came
on their own initiative or were referred by
an outside source. It is our belief this indicates the value of a systematic approach
to the identification, contact, education,
and service of the entire medically indigent
patient universe. In our opinion, simply
opening a family-planning program without
adequate outreach and follow-up mechanisms would have resulted in a much smaller
response,

More than half (402) of the 793 women

from outside the system had experienced
an out-of-wedlock birth. Tables 10 and 11

More than one-fifth (85) were not available

participants. Sixty-eight had terminated, although some may have continued to practice contraception without attending the
clinic.

indicate a very strong motivation on the
part of many of these women to seek, utilize,

rate of illegitimacy (the number of illegitimate births per thousand unmarried females
aged 15 to 44) since the denominator to determine the number of unmarried females of
childbearing age is unavailable until the
1970 census. The data presented here will

indigent births for Lincoln Parish and the
four control parishes. The number of indigent births in both Lincoln Parish and
the control parishes gradually decreased
from 1964 through 1966. In 1967—the first
year in which the program’s impact could
be expected—the number of Lincoln Parish indigent births decreased 32% from the
previous year. In the control parishes, the
decrease between 1966 and 1967 was only
6%.

Table 15 presents the 1966-67 changes
in the number of medically indigent live
births by age of mother in Lincoln Parish
and in the control parishes. The rationale
behind this table is that if a genuine decrease in the number of indigent births has
been occurring in Lincoln Parish and the
program has been serving primarily young
women of low parity, the main decreases
between 1966 and 1967 should be reflected
in the younger age groups. As can be seen
in Table 15, there was a 21.6% decrease in
the number of medically indigent births

years for Lincoln Parish and the control
parishes. In the control parishes, except for
an 11% reduction in 1965 for which no explanation is available, there has been no
general change over the four years; in 1966
and 1967 there were slight increases, In
Lincoln Parish, the number remained fairly
constant during 1964, 1965, and 1966. In
1967, however, only 47 medically indigent
out-of-wedlock births were recorded, a sharp

drop of 40% from 1966. No other change of
this magnitude has been observed in 1967
in any other parish in the state.

Table 17 shows all out-of-wedlock live
births reported to both indigent and nonindigent mothers in Lincoln and the control
parishes. Of the 60 out-of-wedlock births
in Lincoln Parish, 47 were classified as indigent. Although the total number of outof-wedlock births reported in the control
parishes decreased rather markedly in 1965,
during 1966 and 1967 they remained relatively constant. In Lincoln Parish the number remained stable up until 1967 when there
was a 30% decrease in the total number of
illegitimate births reported. Again, this is
the first parish in the state to observe a
change of this order in the total number of
out-of-wedlock births.

remained relatively constant in both the
study and control parishes until 1967 when
in Lincoln Parish it dropped from 156.6 per
thousand to 121.4 per thousand. In the

of family-planning knowledge and practice
in the low-income community could have
some possible influence on persons who are
not patients in the program. Our data indicate that a large number of patients who
had previously experienced out-of-wedlock
births were brought into the program during
the years 1965 through 1967. We would expect that if the 1966-67 changes in Lincoln

control parishes the ratio increased from
173.2 in 1966 to 183.7 in 1967. Lincoln
Parish is the only parish in the state to experience a decrease of this size in the illegitimacy ratio.

Table 19 is presented in order to examine
one of the hypotheses about the possible
impact of family planning upon the decrease
in the number of illegitimate births. For
other than medical reasons we were unable
to give family-planning information and service to patients who had never married or
been pregnant. Therefore, we did not expect to see a marked decrease as a consequence of this program design in the number
of first births classified as out-of-wedlock
in Lincoln Parish, although the diffusion

occur in women having their second or
higher order out-of-wedlock pregnancies. In
the control parishes the number of first
births has remained essentially unchanged
in each of the four years from 1964 through
1967. The number of patients having two
or more births of which the last is illegitimate also remained essentially unchanged,
although there was a decrease from 1964
to 1965 for which we have no explanation.
After 1965 the number of illegitimate births
occurring in women having two or more
births increased slightly.

A different pattern was observed in Lincoln Parish, From 1964 to 1966, the number
of patients having their first out-of-wedlock
birth decreased, while the number of patients

having second or higher order births out
of wedlock remained essentially constant.
However, between 1966 and 1967 there was
a marked decrease of 41.5% when only 31
second or higher order births were reported.
This is the group of patients who were
most affected by the family planning program.

SUMMARY

Among five contiguous rural Louisiana
parishes with similar sociodemographic characteristics, an organized family-planning
program was initiated in 1965 in one parish
(Lincoln). Family-planning services are available to medically indigent couples in
the other parishes, but they are not organized as those described in Lincoln Parish. Preliminary evidence indicates that in
1967 there were significantly greater decreases observed in Lincoln Parish than in
the four surrounding parishes in the following indices;

. Total number of medically indigent births.

. Total number of out-of-wedlock live births.

. Total number of medically indigent out-ofwedlock live births.

. The ratio of indigent out-of-wedlock live
births per thousand indigent live births.

. The ratio of illegitimate live births per thousand live births.

An examination of the illegitimacy ratio
revealed a marked decrease in the illegitimacy ratio of mothers of second or higher
parity. Since the program policy limited
participation to women who had ever been
married or pregnant, the effect of the program on medically indigent out-of-wedlock

births would be reflected primarily in these
higher parities.

We believe that the family-planning program initiated in 1965, particularly its design for systematic identification and contact of the medically indigent population
and adequate provision of services, is principally responsible for the changes observed
in Lincoln Parish in 1967, compared to the
control parishes. This paper reports only
two years’ program experience, and it is
still impossible to rule out the effect of
chance variation on the trends observed.

There is a popular feeling that poor women and those who have experienced an
out-of-wedlock pregnancy are not interested
in family planning. The data presented concerning acceptance and continuing participation of these women in the Lincoln Parish
program provide evidence to repudiate this
myth,
