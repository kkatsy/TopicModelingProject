Sex Differences in Occupational Performance

ABSTRACT: We tested the assumption that labor organizations possess structural arrangements
that may favor specific individual abilities based on neurophysiological characteristics. As some
basic abilities vary between sexes, so will the occupational performance of individuals, according
to the labor organization they work for. We assumed that: (1) Females possess a higher perceptual sensibility (perceptual speed and accuracy), which allows them to discriminate rapid apparition events and fine changes in the environment, in contrast to males who have a greater
ability to manage spatial relationships. (2) Organizations with a functional structure require
more fine perceptual abilities and these requirements are stronger at higher levels of the hierarchy. (3) Occupational performance is related to basic abilities required for a specific task, leading
women to have higher occupational performance than men in labor organizations with a functional structure. By studying the technical and administrative staff of the Universidad Simén
Bolivar (Venezuela), we present evidence that women have a greater capacity for perceptual discrimination; that this capacity relates to occupational performance in a labor organization with
a functional structure; and that this relation is stronger at higher levels in the hierarchy. However, the extremely small sample size available for this study limits the possible generalizations

of these results to other populations.

It is well recognized that behavior is, to
some extent, influenced by sex. There are a
variety of psychological variables (Maccoby, 1988), and social variables (Gutek
and Morasch, 1982; Kanter, 1977) which
are affected by sex. From the biological
perspective, sex-related differences in behavior constitute an adaptive resource and
thus should possess some discernible advantage for each sex (Gouyon et al., 1993).
The most important implications of the biological perspective on sex-related behavioral differences are the existence of different reproductive strategies (Jaffe et al.,
1993 for example), differences in mate
choice (Buss, 1989; Jaffe and Chacon,
1995), and the specialization of social tasks
(Gouyon et al., 1993). Some authors postulate that the differentiation in the tasks performed by each sex during their evolutionary history produced the consequent

specialization in the development and use
of given abilities (Kimura, 1992). Accordingly, it has been shown that women preserve a relatively finer perceptual discrimination capacity, while men possess a
greater capacity for managing spatial relationships (Nagae, 1985; Hampson, 1990;
Williams et al., 1990; Kerns and Berenbaum, 1991; Hedges and Nowell, 1995).
These differences, if purely cultural in
origin, should not exist in modern societies with different assignments of roles
for the sexes. Actual data, though, show
that sex differences in performance of a
mental rotation test and perceptual speed
and accuracy tests remain unaltered. That
is, women excel in tests measuring perceptual speed and accuracy, whereas men
excel in tests measuring the establishment
of spatial relationships (Hanske and Chen,
1985; Nagae, 1985; Allen et al., 1991;

Kerns and Berenbaum, 1991; Kimura,
1992). At the same time, other abilities
do change due to changes in cultural environment (see Hyde 1990), suggesting
that some human abilities are adaptive.
Thus, a continuing adaptive value for persisting sex differences in certain individual abilities seems likely.

The working environment is a social
environment that could reflect the adaptive
importance of these sex differences. People spend a significant amount of their
time at work, and work is understood to
relate to the cognitive and behavioral
patterns of individuals (Walker and Lorch
in Litterer, 1980). There are two wellrecognized basic organizational structures
affecting the working environment. The
Functional structure and the Product structure (Litterer, 1980; Reitz, 1987).

Functional structures are horizontally
differentiated and have a prevalence of
collateral relations between the parts;
therefore, the hierarchical structure acquires a pyramidal shape. The horizontal
differentiation in functional structures is
based on working units formed by persons
with similar abilities or expertise coordinated by a supervisor (Litterer, 1980;
Reitz, 1987; Melinkoff, 1990). Consequently, under these structures, more
social interactions are possible between
members with similar interests. The bulk
of the responsibilities and conflict solving
is coordinated and handled from the top of
the structure. Since collateral relationships
predominate, and since each functional
work group is coordinated from the top,
management must orient its actions toward
the short term, concentrating on rapid apparition events (Reitz, 1987; Walker and
Lorsch, in Litterer, 1980). Accordingly,
under a functional structure, those with
greater abilities to notice rapid apparition

events and fine perceptual abilities to foresee inconspicuous changes in working
conditions will be the most successful.

Product structures are characterized by
a vertical differentiation of the organization with an emphasis on vertical relations. Social contacts between individuals
of different abilities or experience are
common. The supervisory responsibilities
are divided and distributed between management levels (Litterer, 1980; Reitz,
1987; Melinkoff, 1990). In product structures, decisions and conflict resolution
are shared with the lower levels of the organization, and management is more related to strategic planning (Reitz, 1987).
Top management in these organizations
is more oriented to long-term monitoring
of changes in the external environment.
Here, individuals with well-developed
spatial-temporal analytical abilities are
more likely to be successful.

These structural arrangements may have
a direct influence on the individual’s success through certain cognitive-behavioral
variables. Therefore, if some individual
abilities are influenced by sex, and if these
abilities are differently correlated to success in the two organizational structures,
we might expect that in a vertical organization based on product structures males
will dominate the managerial levels,
whereas in horizontal organizations based
on functional structures, females may perform better in managerial levels. Culture
will interfere with these patterns, and thus
men are found to be more prominent in
certain areas despite the fact that women
could perform better. If biological parameters still prevail, it should be possible
to demonstrate a better performance of
women in a functional structure, despite
the fact that they do not predominate in
functional structures at this time.

Data from different countries support
these predictions. That 1s, most vertically organized institutions are maledominated (Acevedo et al., 1993; Kanter,
1976), an extreme example being the military. As society as a whole is thought to
be male-dominated, or evolved from a
male-dominated society, confirmation of
male dominance in organizations with a
product structure is not convincing proof
for sex-related occupational performance
based on differences in individual abilities. However, evidence for female dominance in functional structures, may help
to support our hypothesis.

Individual ability-related performance
in an organization may not be uniform.
Moreover, different levels of organization
may require different expertise and abilities (Melinkoff, 1990). In organizations
with a functional structure, the higher
levels of hierarchy have to solve day-today problems, making decisions about
unexpected problems of high priority; in
the lower levels, however, the tasks are
not necessarily related to decision making. Therefore, higher levels of hierarchy
rather than lower ones, should be more
affected by the type of organizational
structure (Perrow, 1970; Walker and
Lorsch, 1980; Reitz, 1987). We studied
the relation between sex-related individual abilities and occupational performance at various levels of hierarchy in
order to detect a possible social effect of
sex differences in individual aptitudes.

We predict that there are sex differences in occupational performance in organizations and that this polarization of
performance is related to the hierarchical
structure of the organization. If some differences in occupational performance are
related to basic individual abilities dependent on sex, we might predict that in en

vironments where individuals are exposed to rapid apparition stimuli, those
individuals with high perceptual sensibility (as measured by better performance in
tests measuring perceptual speed and accuracy) will possess better occupational
performance. The female/male performance difference due to these abilities
should also be stronger the higher we
climb in the organizational hierarchy. Occupational performance and perceptual
speed and accuracy should be significantly correlated in a functional structure,
whereas individual abilities in establishing spatial relationships should not correlate with occupational performance nor
with the hierarchical level in a functional
structure. That is, in organizations with a
functional structure, women should excel.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Subjects for the study were members of
the technical and administrative staff from
all hierarchical levels of the Universidad
Sim6n Bolivar (Venezuela). This organization possesses a Clear functional structure
as derived from a geometrical analysis of
the organization chart (Melinkoff, 1990).
There is a predominance of collateral relationships over linear relationships, where
horizontal differentiation prevails over vertical differentiation.

The levels of this organization are: Supervisory (Level 4), which includes the
staff that fulfills supervisory and coordinat
ing functions of offices, departments, units,

areas, sections, etc.; Professional (Level 3),
which includes technical personnel with
university degrees working in administrative areas; Administrative (Level 2), including accountants, auditing personnel,
assistants of budget staff, secretaries, typists, archivists, etc.; and Technical (Level

1), including personnel specialized in
technical areas, maintenance and laboratory technicians, audiovisual support
staff, sports trainers, and personne] with a
technical degree.

Occupational performance of employees was estimated by using a standard procedure adopted by the organization, which
relies on an instrument specially developed by the University called Instrumento
de Evaluaci6n de Desempefio Laboral
(IEDL) (USB, 1990). The reliability of
TEDL was estimated by a test-re-test in
consecutive years. The Pearson correlation
coefficient for the scores of 519 employees
with a complete data set for the period
1990-94 were: 0.505 for 1990-91 comparisons; 0.644 for 1991-92; 0.559 for
1992-93; and 0.565 for 1993-94 comparisons (all significant at p < 0.0001). Each
year, employees with the highest scores
got a promotion or a salary increase.

Individual occupational performance
(OP) was expressed as the total score obtained by the subjects in the IEDL. The
total score on IEDL is the sum of the numerical qualifications, equivalent to the
qualitative appraisal given by the various
supervisors for each factor. The factors
were adjusted for each level in order to secure the same maximum total score possible for evaluations at every organizational
level, despite the different responsibilities
of each level. The factors for Levels 4 and
3 were: planning, organization, coordination, knowledge, liability, initiative, decision making, efficiency, personal relationships, communication, control, advice,
capacity to direct (only for Level 4) and
assistance (only for Level 3). For Levels 2
and 1, the common factors were: organization of the work, knowledge, liability, presence (punctuality, permanency, assistance),
personal relationships, materials and equip

ment conservation, communication. Level
2 included quantity and quality of production, and attention to the user. Level 1 included efficiency, decision making, initiative, and advice.

The following individual abilities were
measured: (1) the facility to mentally construct a three-dimensional figure and to
visualize it from different perspectives
(Spatial Relationships); and (2) perceptual
speed and accuracy of response (Speed
and Accuracy). We used the raw score of
the Spatial Relationships (SR) and Speed
and Accuracy (SA) tests belonging to the
Differential Aptitudes Test validated elsewhere (Bennett et al., 1967).

The scores for OP were obtained from
the University. The ability tests (SR and
SA) were applied according to the specifications in Bennett et al. (1967). The difference between SA and SR scores was
calculated by subtracting the raw score of
SR from SA (both scores had a maximum
potential value of 100). :

The data from the total population of
employees working in the institution in
October 1992 included information about
sex, hierarchical level, and occupational
performance for each employee (NV =
639). Data on scores in spatial relationships and in speed and accuracy were not
available, and thus we had to obtain them
by testing a sample of 93 individuals.
These individuals were chosen using a
stratified random sample design. That is,
subjects for these tests were chosen randomly but based on a criteria for minimal
sample size for each group defined by
their level in the organization (at least 10
per cent of the total in that category),
range of occupational performance, and
sex. The desired sample size for each
strata was not always achieved because of
resistance by the selected employees, but

no new individuals were included in the
sample to help minimize sampling bias.
Statistical analysis was performed using the computer package SPSS and consisted of a stepwise multiple regression,
Pearson’s correlation, Anova, KruskalWallis (KW) Anova and Student t-test.

RESULTS

The data of occupational efficiency of
all administrative and technical personnel
of the University showed that the average
OP scores were higher at higher organizational levels. This correlation was statistically significant (Pearson correlation
coefficient r= 0.34, p < 0.0001). The data
also showed that women had on the average higher scores than males (chi-square
= 10.27, p < 0.0014). More women than
men were employed in all levels except
Level 1. Thus, we designed a stratified
sample for this study trying to reach similar numbers of males and females for
each level, covering the largest range of
OP scores possible.

The data from the sample for which
we obtained SA and SR scores is given in
Table 1. A stepwise multiple linear regression analysis of the data revealed that
12 per cent of the variance of OP (multiple R = 0.35) can be predicted with hierarchical level (r = 0.211, p = 0.04) and
SA (r = 0.209, p = 0.04) with a very high
probability (p = 0.004). That is, at higher
levels, occupational performance will be
better, and performance is related to fine
perceptual abilities and perceptual speed
and accuracy, but not to spatial abilities.
Alternatively, a one-way Anova showed
no relation between sex and level or OP,
as predicted from the stratified sampling
method used, but showed a significant
higher OP (F = 6.14, p = 0.01) and SA

score (F = 6.05, p = 0.01) for females, a
direct relationship between OP and SA
(F = 7.32, p = 0.008), but no relation between OP and SR (p > 0.7).

The data (Table 1) also showed that SA
scores of women outperformed those of
men in all occupational levels except Level
2 (chi-square = 10.27, p = 0.0014). The sex
difference between scores in the SA test
were Statistically significant for Levels 4
and 3 (Student’s f-test; tf = 3.21, p = 0.003),
but not for Levels 2 and 1. Men maintained
higher scores in SR than women in all levels except Level 4 (ANOVA: F = 6.09, p <
0.001). Scores of SR test showed significant differences between the hierarchical
levels for both sexes (ANOVA: males: df =
3/30, F = 3.21, p = 0.037; females: df =
3/54, F = 8.56, p < 0.0001), though variation of the scores between levels was
greater for women. In occupation Level 1,
both sexes showed the best scores in SR.
The differences between the aptitude
scores were always greater for females
compared to males. This is consistent with
the fact that females scored higher in SA
and that SA was better than SR in explaining the positive correlation between hierarchical level, OP, and sex.

However, we must note that the extremely small sample size available for
this study limits the possibility of generalizing these results to other populations.

DISCUSSION

The results suggest, as have previous
studies, that significant sex differences in
psychological abilities exist, as assessed by
SR and SA tests. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that, in a functional
structure, abilities related to perceptual
speed and accuracy are more pronounced
in individuals working in higher levels of

the hierarchy and are correlated with better
occupational performance. These abilities
{and possibly others) are asymmetrically
distributed between sexes, explaining, at
least partially, why women outperform
men in numbers, in position in the hierarchy, and in occupational performance. Spatial abilities, prevalent in males, do not
seem to influence the position in the hierarchy in organizations with a functional
structure, nor do they affect occupational
performance. In occupational levels directly related to technical labor, abilities in
establishing spatial relationships are prevalent in both sexes.

The structure of an organization constrains the potential performance of the
employees and may affect the performance of individuals differentially by

sex. We predict that in a product structure
the performance of individuals should be
correlated with abilities in establishing
spatial relations, thus favoring males in
reaching the upper levels of the hierarchy.
Support for this last prediction is difficult
to obtain, given that a similar outcome
may be expected for any organization operating in a male-dominated environment.
We argue that the demonstration of the
opposite tendency, 1.e., females outperforming males in a functional organization, as shown here, is more worthwhile
as it is not predicted by existing theories.
In conclusion, we believe that we have
presented here an example where basic
biological and psycho-physiological characteristics influencing individual behavior
affect complex sociocultural expressions.
