Demographic Analysis of Data
on Illegitimate Births

Joginder Kumar*

Illegitimate births are a source of concern
in most countries because of the social and
economic problems they create. The sociological significance of illegitimacy has been
widely discussed in the literature (Blake,
1961; Davis, 1939a,b; Goode, 1960, 1961;
Hartley, 1966; Malinowski, 1930; Pinchbeck
1956; Vincent, 1961; and Wimperis, 1960.)

Often the trend of the level of illegitimacy
in a country and inter-country comparisons
are depicted by the Illegitimacy Ratio—the
proportion of illegitimate births among all
births in a given year. The Illegitimacy
Ratio may be a good index to show the
magnitude of the social problem, but when
it is used indiscriminately to represent the
likelihood of bearing an illegitimate child or
to indicate family disorganization, sexual
permissiveness, and the like, the conclusions
may be incorrect. An appropriate index to
measure the likelihood of bearing an illegitimate child is the Illegitimacy Rate—the
number of illegitimate births per unmarried
females of childbearing age per year.

Goode (1966, p. 485, Table 1) compares
the illegitimacy levels of several countries by
using the Illegitimacy Ratio. He purports to
show that the United States in 1963 and
England and Wales in 1962 were at about
the same level (63 and 66 illegitimate births
per 1,000 births, respectively). However, the

situation is not so simple. The official figures
corresponding to the census years shown in
Table 1 help to illustrate the problem.

We can see that even though unmarried
females in England and Wales have less
chance of bearing an illegitimate child (as
measured by the Illegitimacy Rate) than
those in the United States, the Illegitimacy
Ratio in England is higher than in the
United States. In this case, the situation
arises because of the higher marital fertility
in the United States, making illegitimate
births a smaller proportion of the total number of births. Therefore, it may be incorrect
to conclude that the level of illegitimacy in
England is higher than that of the United
States. Other instances in which the level
of illegitimacy is discussed only in terms of
the Illegitimacy Ratio can be found in the
works of Goode (1960, p. 21), Myrdal (1945,
p. 41), and Wimperis (1960, p. 21-37).

This study attempts to answer some of
the crucial questions which arise when
studying illegitimacy from the demographic
perspective. What do we mean by “‘level of
illegitimacy?” What do the usual indices,
the Illegitimacy Ratio and the Illegitimacy
Rate, indicate about the direction and extent of change in the level of illegitimacy?
What are the contributing factors which determine the level? In answering these questions, we also present a new methodology
for analyzing data on illegitimate births.

Historical data from Norway and Sweden
are used to illustrate the methodology as
well as to present a clear picture of the trend
of illegitimacy in those countries.

Some remarks about the main features of
our methodology may be appropriate here.
Let us assume we have sets of data on four
demographic factors at ten-year intervals,
and we would like to study the trend of illegitimacy in terms of these four factors on
a decade-to-decade basis. For each decade
we want to identify one or more demographic factors whose change brought about
the observed change in the level of illegitimacy, and then we want to determine the
relative contribution of each factor. The
direct approach to this goal involves many
standardization processes. Thus, the analysis
may become tedious to the researcher and
reader alike. For example, in the case of four
factors one has to perform fourteen different
standardizations to exhaust all the possibilities.1 In this paper we describe a simple
procedure of demographic manipulation by
which the observed change in the level can
be almost fully explained by performing
only one or two standardizations. Our procedure enables us to quickly select the most
important factor or combination of factors;
then the relevant standardizations can be
easily performed.

An important aspect of standardization
technique is the selection of a standard
population. There are no fixed rules, and the
population selected largely depends on the
problem at hand. We believe that the selection should be conceptually meaningful so
that the results of standardization can be
interpreted easily. For our purposes, we
have chosen the population for the first year
of each decade as the “standard population,” rather than selecting one common
“standard population” for the whole analy

sis. For example, if we wanted to explain the
change in the level of illegitimacy during
1950-60 in Sweden in terms of changes in the
marital distribution, it is more meaningful
to select either the 1950 or the 1960 marital
distribution as “standard” than to select
some other marital distribution, such as
that of 1900 (which is the beginning year
in the illustrative examples in this paper).
An example wherein the selection of a common standard population is quite appropriate is provided by Coale (1967) in his

the development of low fertility.

We have not attempted to determine the
exact contributions of each of the demographic factors in terms of their independent effects and their interaction effects.
The necessary methods are available, but
they are quite lengthy and complicated. An
authoritative account of such methods is
given by Kitagawa (1955).

DEMOGRAPHIC FORMULATION OF
THE PROBLEM

Specifically, we have two aims: (1) to
identify the demographic factors, the interaction of which leads to an observed level of
illegitimacy; (2) to determine the relative
contribution of these demographic factors in
an observed change in the level of illegitiDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

macy between two dates (e.g., two consecutive census years).

For the purpose of this study, an illegitimate birth is one which occurs to an unmarried (single, widowed, or divorced) female;
consequently, any birth occurring to a currently married female is legitimate. The following symbols will be used:

4% = age group x to x + 4 years, or age x if

data are in single years of age;

F, = number of females at age +;

jf< = proportion, at age x, of all females in
childbearing period (15-44 years);

gz = proportion of total females at age x

who are unmarried;

age-specific illegitimate fertility rate

(number of illegitimate births per un
married female of age x per year);

ts

jx = age-specific legitimate fertility rate
(number of legitimate births per married female of age x per year).

If N denotes the total number of females
in childbearing ages, then

N= Fz;

and

Further,
Fz = number of unmarried females at age x;

Thus, the Illegitimacy Ratio, which represents illegitimate births as a proportion of
total births, may be presented as follows:

The Illegitimacy Rate, or the number of

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by JN, we get:

Rate Shae” (3)

The Ratio and Rate expressed in the form
of equations (1) and (3) are very convenient
to compute. If we have expressed them in a
seemingly complex way, it is because this
mode of symbolizing the two measures has
the following methodological advantages:

1. They clearly show their composition
with respect to demographic factors, f, gz,
iz, and jz, which determine the level of illegitimacy.

2. The above expressions have a distinct
advantage in setting down the standardization procedure with respect to one or more
demographic factors. For example, if the object is to measure the effect of change in age
composition of females, from set fz to f,’ on

a

the Illegitimacy Ratio, the standardized
Ratio would be given by

Lhe! date
Ufa Qate + fe (1 — q2)je

3. These expressions are helpful in visualizing the direction of change in the Rate or
the Ratio when one or more demographic
factors changes its level. For example, a
change in the level of g, would have little
effect on the Rate because it occurs both in
the numerator and denominator (equation
[3]). On the other hand, if the level of gq;
rises, it has a dual effect on the Illegitimacy
Ratio. A rise in gz, and consequently the decline in (1 — gz), would sharply reduce the
value of the quotient

Df, 2(1 a qz) jz
Lfedein

Hence the Illegitimacy Ratio would increase sharply. This is what we mean by a
dual effect.

4, The Ilegitimacy Rate as expressed in
the form of equation (3) clearly indicates
that it is a weighted mean of 7,’s—the agespecific illegitimacy rates. The weights are
JcQe. Thus, it would remain more stable with
respect to changes in f, and gq, than the Hlegitimacy Ratio.

5. Each of the sums has useful qualitative
and quantitative meanings:

2f2gz = the overall probability of
being single in the childbearing ages. It can also be
phrased as the overall proportion single in the childbearing ages.

Yfrgztz = the overall probability of
giving birth to an illegitimate child by a female (not
an unmarried female, but
any female) in the childbearing ages in a population
with a given age and marital distribution. It can also

Illegitimate Births 95

called the general rate of
illegitimacy.

Zfe(1 — gz)j2 = the overall probability of
giving birth to a legitimate
child by @ female (not a
married female, but any female) in the childbearing
ages in a population with a
given age and marital distribution, It can also be
called the general rate of
legitimacy.

It should be noted here that the sums
Lfgziz and Zfz(1 — gz)jz are not the exact
expressions of the respective probabilities.
They should be regarded as estimators or
approximations of the probabilities, because
i, and 7, are the central-rates for the period
rather than the probabilities. In spite of this
limitation, we have used the word ‘‘probability” because it provides a consistent way
to define the term “level of illegitimacy”
and its measures in our following discussion.

The term “level of illegitimacy” can be
interpreted as the probability of occurrence
of an illegitimate birth to a specified female.
Since, by definition, a birth occurring to an
unmarried female is classified as illegitimate,
the level of illegitimacy is best measured by
determining the probability of an unmarried
female bearing a child during her childbearing years, This probability is measured by
the Illegitimacy Rate as defined above by
equation (3). The denominator consists of
a population (unmarried females in the
childbearing ages) exposed to the risk of the
event (illegitimacy) mentioned in the numerator. Thus, it is a probability measure of
the level of illegitimacy.

Now we can relax the specifications for
the female. If the population exposed to the
risk of illegitimacy is defined as being composed of females in childbearing ages (irrespective of their marital status), the probability measure of the level of illegitimacy
would be the sum 2/,9.t,. Therefore, depending on the question asked, both measures,
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

96 Kumar

the Illegitimacy Rate and 2f,q.7z, can be
used to indicate the level of illegitimacy.

In this paper, we have designated the sum
2frQulz as the general probability of illegitimacy or general rate of illegitimacy and the
sum 2f,(1 — gz)jz aS the general probability
of legitimacy or general rate of legitimacy.
The general probability of illegitimacy is the
probability of joint occurrence of two independent events—first, the probability that
the female is unmarried, and second, that
she bears a child. Thus, according to the
laws of probability of joint occurrence of
independent events, we would get

LfrQcte = Illegitimacy Rate X 2g: .

This is the same expression as equation (3).
In this paper we have used both measures
(the general probability of illegitimacy and
the Illegitimacy Rate) primarily because
their comparison yields the relative influence of the marital distribution on illegitimacy.

As defined in equation (1), the Illegitimacy Ratio shows illegitimate births as a
proportion of all births in a given year. If the
object is to measure the prevalence of illegitimacy in relation to legitimacy, the IIlegitimacy Ratio would be an appropriate
index; but it is not a proper measure of the
level of illegitimacy as defined above. Therefore, when the Ratio is described as the
“level of illegitimacy,” as sometimes happens in the literature, it could be misleading.
The popularity of the Illegitimacy Ratio is
due to its simple meaning and to the simplicity of collecting the data. One source, the
vital registration system, is sufficient to
compute the Ratio. We have already discussed the fact that the Ratio could be influenced in many ways without any change
in i. As an additional example, a decline in
the level of marital fertility, 7., would increase the Ilegitimacy Ratio, and this could
lead to an incorrect conclusion that the level
of illegitimacy (in the probability sense) is
rising. Therefore, the Ratio should be used

with great caution. We shall encounter examples in the present analysis which show
its misuse.

Keeping the above discussion of this section in mind, we now formulate the general
mode of analysis. When one compares the
values of the three sums (2/,92, Zfegztz, and
Zfz(1 — gz)jz) at two successive dates, the
comparison provides certain clues as to
which demographic factors have caused a
change, if any, in the level of illegitimacy
during the period.

Here, a question can be raised as to why
the demographic factors are identified by
comparing the three sums rather than by
directly observing the data. Generally, the
basic data are stated in six quinquennial age
groups in the childbearing ages. There will
be no problem in identifying a demographic
factor if all six values encountered have
changed in the same direction. Then we can
say conclusively that this demographic factor must have contributed to the observed
change in the level of illegitimacy. But,
when the age-specific levels have changed in
opposite directions, we cannot state conclusively the overall direction and significance
of the demographic factor. The problem becomes more acute when data are given in
single years of age. To state the answer with
some confidence, one must compute an overall index of the demographic factor; but, to
do so in the case of 7, and 7,, we may be
begging the basic question. The Swedish
age-specific illegitimacy rates in 1940 and
1950 are an example of the problem (see
Table 11). In any case, the method of comparison of the three sums (as described below) can take care of all the situations. It
also reduces the number of calculations.

The following systematic method can be
used to identify the demographic factors for
standardization by comparing the values of
the three sums. It should be noted that the
various implications of different situations in
the following classification are most likely
to be true in the domain of demographic posDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

sibilities. Mathematically, the opposite implication is possible; demographically, the
opposite implication is highly unlikely to
occur. Further, in the remaining part of the
paper, the statements regarding the direction of change of demographic factors (/;,
Qz, tz, and jz) implicitly mean that the statements concern their overall level. For example, the statement ‘“/, and gz have not
changed”’ actually means that the overall
levels of f, and g; have not changed, The
phrase “overall levels of’ is dropped for
simplicity of discussion.

Let the superscript 1 denote the data at
the beginning of the period and superscript 2
denote the data at the end of the period.

CasE I: When there is no significant difference between the sums Zfigh and Ufzqr
a) This would imply that f, and g, have
not changed during the period. Mathematically, it is possible that f, and g, may change
in such a way that Df,gz does not change.
Demographically, such a case would occur
rarely and could be easily detected.

6) If there is no significant difference between Zfigii! and Zf2gziz, it would imply
that the 7,’s also have not changed. If there
is a significant difference, it would mean that
the 7,’s have changed during the period since
fz and gz have not changed. In such a case,
we should select 7, as a factor of standardization of the Rate and the Ratio.

c) The decision procedure regarding 7, is
similar to that for 7, described in step 8.

Case II: When there is a significant difference between the sums Zfig, and Zf2¢2.

a) This would imply that either f, or qz,
or both f, and g., have changed during the
period. The preliminary decision could be
made by looking at the data on f, and qz.
If gz is an apparent demographic factor
which has changed, then we should standardize 2f,g. with respect to gz. The hypothesis regarding gz would be true if we find
that the standardized and unstandardized
sums are approximately equal, that is, if

legitimate Births 97

Digs & Ufrg:. Similarly we can test the
hypothesis regarding f, and g, together.

6) After selecting the demographic factor(s) of standardization in step a, the
same factor should be used to standardize
ZfrQztz. If the standardized and unstandardized sums are approximately equal, the
factor zz has not changed. Otherwise, the
factor 7,, also has changed. In symbols, the
procedure would be as follows:

Let gz be the demographic factor of
standardization which was identified in
step a. If Dfiguis LY Sfegiic, then 7, has not
changed during the period. If Zfigyit +
Zfrgsiz, then i, has changed during the
period and it should be selected as an additional factor of standardization.

c) The decision procedure regarding j,
is similar to that of 7, described in step 8.

It should be emphasized that the above
procedures are adopted so as to achieve the
required results in the minimum amount of
time, with minimum effort. There may be a
few occasions in which the process would
fail. In such cases, common sense should
prevail.

ANALYSIS OF TREND OF ILLEGITIMACY:
ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES

In this section, we shall attempt to account for the changes in the level of illegitimacy during each successive decade for
Norway and Sweden from 1900 to 1960.

The statistics on illegitimacy suffer from a
variety of errors. Any change in their magnitude could lead to an incorrect trend. Varia-~
tions in completeness of registration can introduce spurious trends and differentials
into the measure of level of illegitimacy. Because these variations are likely to be larger
across countries than through time, no intercountry analysis is attempted. The introduction of a compulsory registration system
with severe penalties for nonregistration of
illegitimate births could result in a sudden
rise in the level of illegitimacy. Similarly, a
change in the social penalties and welfare

benefits system could influence the level of
registration. It is beyond the scope of this
study to adjust the illegitimacy data for
under-registration and other errors because
our main objective is to present the methodological aspects of the analysis of illegitimacy data.

NORWAY

We shall compute the Legitimacy Ratio
and the Illegitimacy Rate corresponding to
a given set of four demographic variables,
fry Ux, tz, and jz, for which the basic data are
presented in Tables 2-5. It would be a very
space-consuming task if we were to reproduce a detailed computational table in each
case. Therefore, only the final results of the
computation are presented. However, we
shall illustrate the detailed computational
procedure with reference to Norway, 1900,
in Table 6. The sum 2f,g, means that 58.4%

 

Social Biology

of the females aged 15-44 years were unmarried; the sum 2f,g,tz implies that the
probability of bearing an illegitimate child
by a female aged 15-44 years was 0.0099
(9.9 illegitimate births per 1,000 females of
childbearing age in 1900); and the sum
2f2(1 — qz)jz implies that the probability
of bearing a legitimate child by a female 15~
44 years old was 0.1280 (128.0 legitimate
births per 1,000 females of childbearing age
in 1900). Incidentally, it can be easily seen
that the general fertility rate, that is, the
number of births per female of childbearing
age, equals [Z/f.q.t2 + Zf.(1 — gz)72]. Thus,
the general fertility rate for Norway was
137.9 per 1,000 females 15-44 years of age
in 1900.

The trends of illegitimacy ratios, illegitimacy rates, and general probabilities of illegitimacy (Zf.9.tz) are shown in Table 7.

low the same trend. Although their 1960
levels are about half of those in 1900, they
have different patterns during the intervening period. Apart from significant differences
in the magnitude of the per cent decline
since 1900 (compare cols. 3 and 5), the rates
and ratios even show different directions of
change during some periods. Between 1930
and 1946, the index of the ratio declined by
18 points while that of the rate showed a
rise of 17 points. On the other hand, the illegitimacy rate and general probability of
illegitimacy follow the same trend up to
1930. But, in 1960, the general probability
of illegitimacy is 66% of the 1900 estimate
as against 46% in the case of the illegitimacy
rate. The difference in the two indices occurs because of changes in the marital distribution (2f,¢-). In this case, the mean age

at marriage seems to have reduced significantly during 1930-60. We shall attempt to
explore the demographic causes of changes
in the level of illegitimacy during each successive period.

1900-10. Table 8 contains the values of
the three sums and other necessary computations for the period 1900-10. A comparison of the values of the sum Z/f2gz shows that
there were no significant changes in marital
distribution during 1900-10, but the sums
Zfrgziz were reduced considerably over the
same period (cols. 2 and 3). This means that
there was a significant reduction of 7,’s,
age-specific illegitimacy rates. There is also
some reduction in 2f,(1 — gz)jz, the probability of bearing a legitimate child.

With these clues regarding the behavior
of demographic factors affecting the il

legitimacy level, we may now test our hypothesis that 7, is the major demographic
factor which has caused changes in the level
of illegitimacy as indicated by the Ilegitimacy Rate and 2f,q.t,. The 1910 ratios and
rates are recomputed by replacing the 2,
column with the 7, column of 1900, that is,
standardizing the 1910 rates and ratios with
respect to the age-specific illegitimacy rates.
Using the computational procedure outlined
in Table 5, we get the standardized Ratio
and Rate for 1910 as shown in column 4 of
Table 8. The standardized Illegitimacy Rate
and the general probability of illegitimacy
are equal to those in 1900, implying that
there was a real decline in the illegitimacy
Jevel between 1900 and 1910 (since there was
no change in marital conditions). However,
the standardized Ratio (81.3) is higher than
the 1900 level (72.1). This occurred because
the level of 7,’s, age-specific legitimacy rates,
have also declined. This is one illustration
of the procedure which accounts for changes
in the illegitimacy level in terms of the
demographic factors.

1910-20 (cols. 2, 3, and 4 in Table 9). To
avoid duplications, we shall present the
analysis of trends during the years 1910 to
1960 in Table 9. The calendar-year column
headings with an asterisk denote an IIlegitimacy Ratio and Rate which are
standardized with respect to the demographic factor mentioned in the heading
(the new level of the demographic factor always corresponds toits level at the previous
date).

During this period, there were no changes
in Df292, that is, marital distribution did not
change, But, there was a reduction in
2f2(1 — gz)jz, and an increase in Zfrgziz.
Therefore, we have standardized the 1920
indices with respect to both i, and jz. The
resemblance between the 1910 and 1920
(col. 4) illegitimacy indices is very close.
This implies that the changes in 7, and 7;
(age-specific illegitimate and legitimate fertility rates) were wholly responsible for the

observed changes in the illegitimacy indices
between 1910 and 1920.

1920-30 (cols. 3, 5, and 6 in Table 9).
Comparing the three sums from Table 9
listed above, we find that there are drastic
declines in the probabilities of illegitimate
and legitimate births. Columns 6 and 3 show
that when we standardize the 1930 Ratio
and the Rate with respect to both 7, and 72,
the changes during the decade are clearly
shown. One interesting thing to observe is
that there was a drastic decline (from 14.6
to 8.7) in the Illegitimacy Rate, but comparatively little decline in the Ratio. The
decline in the levels of 7, and 7, tend to
counterbalance their net effect on the value
of the quotient (Zf.[1 — gz]j2)/(Zfeqziz), and
consequently on the Ratio. The direction of
change in the Ratio depends on the relative
speed of the decline of 2f,(1 — gz)j, and
DfrQziz- In the present case, the speed of
decline of the latter sum is greater than that
of the former, and therefore the quotient
increases; hence, the ratio decreases (equation [2]). This was the underlying mechanism of decline in the Illegitimacy Ratio
from 75.7 to 70.0 during the decade 1920-30.

1930-46 (cols. 5, 7, 8, and 9 in Table 9).
A comparison of the three sums between
1930 and 1946 (cols. 4 and 7) reveals that
there are significant reductions in the probability of remaining single (about 17%) and
the probability of bearing a legitimate child
(about 32%). Though there is a less significant rise (about 7%) in the probability of
bearing an illegitimate child (Zf,g,7), the
observed illegitimacy rate shows an increase
of 29%.

What can we learn from these figures?
The level of gz has certainly gone down (and
some changes have also occurred in fz). This
fact could account for a good part of the observed increase in the value of Zf.(1 — qz)jz
during this period. We can say something
about the behavior of 7,’s only after we have
established the role of changes in the level
of gz. Therefore, gz is selected as a first factor

Social Biology

of standardization (col. 8). The standardized
sum 2f,gz becomes almost equal to the 1930
value and the standardized sum 2f,(1 —
gz)jz accounts for about two-thirds of the
total increase during 1930-46. Thus, there
was a substantial decrease in the level of
g.’s during this period. In addition, the
standardized value of the general probability of illegitimacy becomes about 24%
more than the 1930 level, while the observed
difference is only 7%. This fact implies that
there was a significant increase in the level
of 7,’s during 1930-46; otherwise, in the face
of a substantial decrease in the level of
g,’s, the standardized sum 2f2g.i. should
have decreased. Thus, the level of all the
demographic factors has changed during
this period. Column 9 standardized the 1946
values with respect to gz, 7z,and 7,, and they
compare very well with those in column 5.
Obviously, the remaining differences are due
to changes in the level of f:.

1946-50 (cols. 7, 10, and 11, in Table 9).
Comparing the three sums, we note that
2f2gz and Zf2g,i2 have reduced appreciably.
Thus gz and 7, may be the important demographic factors which have caused the
change in the illegitimacy level.? Column 11
shows the results of standardization with respect to g, and i;. We observe that the
change in the Illegitimacy Rate is fully explained and the difference in Illegitimacy
Ratio is reduced. The remaining difference
in the Illegitimacy Ratios (between 57.3 and
65.3) would be explained by 7, since there is
a significant difference in magnitude of
Zf-(1 — gz)jz between columns 7 and 11.

1950-55 (cols. 10, 12, and 13 in Table 9).
Thisis an excellent example to illustrate the
“dual” effect of change in gz on the Ratio.

2 The age-distribution, f,, may also be listed as
one of the demographic factors. We would not gain
any insight into the underlying change if both 7
und g, are selected as factors of standardization, because Z/,gz would not change. Generally, a change
in the level of f does not alter the illegitimacy
level so appreciably as other demographic factors.
On the other hand, g is a very important factor,

and it should be selected as the first factor of standardization whenever 2/f-g, changes.

Vol. 16, No. 2

By standardizing the 1955 illegitimacy indices with respect to g,, the resulting indices
of 44.3 and 8.6 (col. 13) become very close to
those of 41.3 and 8.5 (col. 10). Thus, the
decline in the level of gz, meaning that the
proportion married has increased, was responsible for the decline in the Ratio but had
absolutely no effect on the Illegitimacy Rate
during 1950-55. How could this happen? A
decline in the level of gz implies a rise in the
level of 1 — gz. These two appear in the
numerator and denominator of the quotient
(Zf-[1 — ge]j2/Zfegrjz). The result is that
both acted in the same direction, that is,
towards increasing the value of the quotient—the dual effect of gz. This, in turn,
decreased the valueof theIllegitimacy Ratio
from 41.3 to 34.6 during 1950-55.

1955-60. There were relatively minor
changes in the illegitimacy level during this
period; therefore, there is no need for any
analysis.

Conclusion. The analysis of the Norwegian data makes it quite clear that a
description of the trend of the illegitimacy
level is not as simple as Table 7 tends to
show. An in-depth analysis is a precondition
to drawing any conclusions concerning the
trend and level of illegitimacy. There were
genuine declines in the level of illegitimacy
shown by the fact that we had to standardize with respect to iz, age-specific illegitimacy rates, four times in six periods to find
the explanation for the trend. Another important conclusion is that we would have
been terribly misled had we relied wholly on
illegitimacy ratios as indices of the level
of illegitimacy. Since 1930, changes in the
marital distribution of females have affected
the illegitimacy ratios considerably. Marital
fertility rates, j,, have also been an important cause of change in illegitimacy
ratios in Norway. Finally, the sums Z/f,q-,
DZfrQztz, and Lfz(1 — az)jz have declined by
39%, 67%, and 33%, respectively, during
1900-60. These remarkable changes reflect
the fact that the demographic factors which

 

Illegitimate Births 103

determine the level of illegitimacy have
undergone drastic changes in Norway.

SWEDEN

The methodology of analysis in the case
of Sweden will be the same as we have described in detail for Norway. Therefore, we
shall describe the rest of the analysis by
presenting detailed tables with brief descriptions, highlighting only the important
features. The data for demographic factors
are shown in Tables 10-13.

Table 14 shows that the illegitimacy rates
and ratios reveal an entirely different trend.
During 1900-60, the Ratio did not decline
much, but the Rate dropped by 23% and
the general probability of illegitimacy
(2fzgziz) by 49%. The general probability
remained constant, around 0.0075, during
1940-60 but the Illegitimacy Rate has increased significantly (from 14.8 to 20.0).
This would mean that gz is acting as a
counterbalance. During 1910-20, 1920-30,
1940-50 and 1950-60, the rates and ratios
follow opposite directions of change. The
following paragraphs offer a brief explanation of the causes of the trend of eg teiacy
in Sweden.

Table 15 gives a more or less self-explanatory analysis of the trend of illegitimacy in Sweden. The brief notes for the
decades are as follows:

1900-10 (cols. 2, 3, and 4, of Table 15).
The significant rise of the Ratio, but with
no such change in the Rate, was caused by a
decline in the level of legitimacy (compare
the sums 2/,(1 — qz)jz) during this period.
This fact becomes obvious from column 4.

1910-20 (cols. 3, 5, and 6, of Table 15).
A comparison of the three sums between
1910 and 1920 suggests an appreciable decline (about 10%) in the level of general
probability of legitimacy (2f:(1 — qz)jz). At
the same time, there is no significant difference between the 1910 and 1920 values of
2f2gz. Therefore, jz is chosen as a factor of
standardization. Column 6 shows very

clearly that the decline in 7, accounts for the
whole rise in the Ratio during this period.

1920-30 (cols. 5, 7, and 8, of Table 15).
This is a very interesting case in the sense
that the Illegitimacy Rate shows a drastic
decline in the illegitimacy level (by 34%),
but the Ratio records a slight rise (4%).
This is similar to the case of Norway for the
decade 1920-30. As mentioned in the case of
Norway, the final direction of change in the
Ratio depends on the relative speed of
changes in Zf,gztz and Zf,(1 — gz) 7:.

In order for the Ratio to increase, the
rate of decline of =f,(1 — gz)jz should be fast

four demographic factors. Column 10 shows
another example of the dual effect of
changes in gz on the Ratio. Obviously, the
remaining difference between the standardized Ratio and Rate (153.6 and 18.3)
of 1940 (col. 11) and the observed Ratio
and Rate (163.9 and 18.6) of 1930 are due to
the fourth demographic factor not included
in the standardization, that is f;, the age
distribution of females within childbearing
ages.

er than that of 2f,¢.t;. The observed figures, showing a 38.4% and 35.4% decline respectively from 1920 to 1930, support this
conclusion.

Since the difference between the rates of
decline of the two components is small
(3%), it resulted in an insignificant increase
in the Ratio (4%) during 1920-30. However,
the 35.4% decline in the =f,q,7, resulted in
the decline of the Illegitimacy Rate by the
same magnitude. In other words, the marital
distribution did not affect the illegitimacy
level during this period. Finally, the standardized Ratio and Rate (with respect
to i, and j, simultaneously) of 1930 (col. 8)
compare very well with those of 1920.

of illegitimacy. There is an amazing decline in 2f2gz from 0.497 to 0.377. In view
of this decline, the observed significant rise
in the probability of a legitimate child,
2f2(1—gz)jz, should be interpreted carefully.
It is more likely to be due to increase in
(1 — gz) rather than in j,. To support our
conjecture we note that in 1940 2f,(1 —

macy Ratio during 1950-60. We note that
the sum 2f,(1 — gz)7, has decreased, while
the other two sums did not change significantly. Therefore, as a starting point, we
should select 7, as a factor of standardization. However, in this case, we prefer to depart from the general approach. Table 10
shows remarkable differences in f, values
between 1950 and 1960. Therefore, we have
standardized the 1960 indices with respect to f, (see col. 15). Although we get
approximately the same values of Illegitimacy Rate and Ratio as those of 1950, we
are tempted to call this a coincidence. After
the standardization, instead of mimimizing
the differences, the differences in 2f,g2 and
Df2gztc were increased (compare col. 12 and
15). We also know from the observed figures
that the level of 7, has changed during this
period. The whole situation can be partly
explained by the fact that =f, is always
unity. Consequently, the standardized sums
have adjusted themselves in such a way
that they have produced the 1950 level of
Illegitimacy Rate and Ratio. Of course, the
level of illegitimacy, as indicated by the
Rate and the general probability, has not
changed much during this period.

Conclusion. On the whole, the influence
of changes in the demographic factors in
Sweden were as complicated as in the case
of Norway. The general probability of
illegitimacy, =f2g.i2, remained stable during
1900-20, dropped abruptly by 35% in 1930,
and since then has fluctuated around the
level of 0.0075. Looking at the other angle,
there were significant changes in the levels
of iz, since it was chosen as a factor of
standardization in four out of six decades.
The probability of remaining single remained unchanged during 1900-30, and
dropped sharply during the next two decades. This was the main cause of the
significant reduction in the Illegitimacy
Ratio from the level of 160 in 1930 to around
100 during 1950-60.

Added to this, the same pace of changes
in the level of marital fertility (2f.(1 —qz)jz)

affected the behavior of illegitimacy ratios
considerably. This is evident from the fact
that 7, has been used as a factor of standardization four times. Thus, all the demographic factors have played a very important role in the Swedish trend of illegitimacy
during 1900-60. The numerical measures of
the reduction in the three sums are: Zf,g2
declined by 36%, Zfrgziz by 49%, and
2f-(1 —qz)jz by 45% during 1900-60. These
drastic reductions clearly indicate the
complexity of the analysis. On the whole,
both the Illegitimacy Rate and general
probability have decreased to a lesser extent than in Norway during 1900-60.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have identified the demographic factors, the interaction of which leads to an
observed level of illegitimacy, and determined their relative contribution to an observed change in the illegitimacy level.
In this study, the term “level of illegitimacy” is explained as the probability of
occurrence of an illegitimate birth to a specified female. The demographic factors identified are: age-distribution of females in the
childbearing ages (f.), proportion of total
females at age x who are unmarried (g;),
age-specific rates of illegitimate births (i,),
and age-specific rates of legitimate births
(jz). The first two factors determine the
proportion of the female population exposed to the risk of bearing an illegitimate
child.

The Illegitimacy Ratio (number of
illegitimate births per 1,000 total births)
and the Illegitimacy Rate (number of
illegitimate births per 1,000 unmarried females in childbearing ages) are two wellknown measures of the “level” of illegitimacy. We have presented the necessary
mathematical expressions of these measures
in terms of the four demographic factors and
listed various properties of them. By our
definition, the Illegitimacy Ratio does not

Illegitimate Births 107

measure the “level of illegitimacy” but the
Iilegitimacy Rate does. Our discussion
shows that the Ilegitimacy Ratio, besides
not being a probability measure, could be a
misleading indicator of trend of illegitimacy.
This fact has been proved in the analysis of
actual data from Norway and Sweden.
Apart from the Illegitimacy Rate, we have
also used the expression 2f2g.7z as another
measure of illegitimacy. This, designated as
general probability of illegitimacy, refers to
the probability of bearing an illegitimate
child by a female in the childbearing ages
(irrespective of her marital status).

The major contribution of this study is
the development of a systematic method
for analyzing data on illegitimacy. Many
different kinds of situations were successfully handled by this method during analysis of data on illegitimacy in Norway and
Sweden. In particular, three sums proved
extremely useful. They are:

1. 2f2g.—the overall probability of being
single during the childbearing ages.

2. ZfrQztz—the overall probability of
bearing an illegitimate child by a female of
childbearing age.

3. Zf-(1 — gz)jz—the overall probability
of bearing a legitimate child by a female
of childbearing age.

These sums are very sensitive measures of
marital condition, illegitimate fertility, and
marital fertility, respectively.
