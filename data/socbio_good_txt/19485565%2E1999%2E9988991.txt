Is the Relationship Between Fertility of
Parents and Children Really Weak?

ABSTRACT: The relationship between fertility of parents and children has been designated as
“weak” by most investigators. This paper reviews the evidence over the past century and argues
that, even allowing for problems with available data sources, the relationship was probably close
to zero for pre-transitional populations. However, over time, the relationship has tended to become more substantial and is now of a similar order of magnitude in developed countries as
other widely used explanatory variables. Possible mechanisms for the observed relationship are
discussed, especially the roles of socialization and inherited factors. The types of data used are
compared to the scientific questions posed, and the limitations of the common comparison of
married-mother/married-daughter pairs are considered. Finally, some evidence from recent
large-scale surveys in Britain and the United States is presented to show changes over recent pe
riods and the relative effects of sibship size of fathers and mothers.

The association of fertility between
parents and their children has been a subject of continuing scientific interest for a
century. Pearson et al. (1899)' investigated the extent of fertility correlations
among branches of the British upper
classes, largely arising from Pearson’s interest in its effect on population biology.
Pearson (p. 260) pointed out that “intellectual and emotional characters [that are]
... ultimately a result of physical conformation ... will be inherited according to
the same law as that which holds for
physically measurable organs.” He argued

'This paper is comprised of three parts with different
authors. The first part, pages 258 to 278, by Pearson is a
theoretical discussion of the measurement of heritable
factors; the second by Pearson and Lee, pages 279 to
290 and 316 to 323, is concerned with the heritability of
human fertility; and the third by Pearson with the assistance of Bramley-Moore, pages 290 to 315 and 324 to
330, deals with inherited fecundability by thoroughbred
mares. The biological emphasis is therefore apparent.

that fertility and fecundity are part of the
former group. However, the possibility
that preferences for a particular number
of children in a given environment may
be similarly transmitted is also examined
in this review. Pearson considered the
number of children of different dyads, including father-son, mother-daughter, and
paternal grandmother-granddaughter pairs,
although they note that for the older generation the term “parent” is equally suitable. As might be anticipated, Pearson
product moment correlation coefficients
are the most common form of summary
measure used, and they remain so today.”

"Values were calculated for “weighted” and “unweighted” cases. In the former case with a family containing n children, each mother will be included n
times, as compared to the latter case where each mother
appears only once. Studies which use random samples
of parents as the unit of analysis (i.e., collect information about number of own sibs and of children) use the

Pearson and Lee (p. 277) were careful to
distinguish between intergenerational correlations that could arise because of transmission of fertility between parents and children and spurious ones due to the mixing of
heterogeneous populations. Subsequently,
investigations have attempted to control for
such heterogeneity, for example, by breaking general populations into more homogenous units or confining analysis to particular sub-populations. However, multivariate
analysis is increasingly the method of
choice for implementing such controls.

PRE-TWENTIETH-CENTURY
POPULATIONS

Among the relationships and groups
studied (Figure 1), Pearson et al. found a
maximum correlation coefficient of
0.2130 between the fertility of 1,000
mother-daughter pairs from the peerage
and baronetage, both of whom had marriages that had lasted for at least 15 years.
The standard errors are based on the assumption of independent random samples
which will underestimate values in some
cases. The lowest reported correlation coefficient between female pairs was 0.0418
for 4,418 pairs from a mixture of upperclass groups with the only restriction that

latter approach, whereas designs such as record linkage
that collect information on all children in families (i.e.,
collect information about number of parent’s sibs and
own sibs) may use the former approach. Some studies
collect information from children on their parents’ number of sibs, but this cannot provide information on those
members of the older generation who remain childless.
Simulation shows that the correlation coefficients for
fertility of successive generations computed from these
two designs are very similar in practice, although Pearson and Lee’s study shows different values for unclear
reasons. If the sample design involves collection of data
from siblings, the nonindependence of the responses
would mean that the standard errors would be greater
than for a random sample.

the daughter should have been married
for 15 years or her spouse had died before 15 years. These data were weighted,
and the possibility of excluding some infant deaths was acknowledged. Pearson
attributed the low value in part to the particular characteristics of this population.
Although heterogeneity would usually be
expected to inflate correlations, Pearson
and Lee argued that the female landed
gentry were often heiresses, who in a system of largely impartible inheritance
were more likely to have come from
smaller families.

Father/son analysis was based on
1,000 pairs. The male figure for the peerage corresponding to the female value of
0.2130 above was 0.0656 (but no restriction was placed on the length of the fathers’ marriage), and the figure for landed
gentry was higher at 0.1161, but included
a restriction that the father’s marriage
should also have lasted for 15 years.

Essentially the same male data used
by Pearson and Lee were reanalyzed by
Williams and Williams (1974) with almost identical numerical results, but with
a different interpretation. Pearson and
Lee implicitly assume a population who
make no deliberate attempt to limit fertility, although they do note this possibility
as a factor which would tend to depress
correlations (p. 279). A consequence of
this natural fertility assumption is that
there is assumed to be little, if any, correlation between the fertility of fathers and
sons, since the only male mechanism
considered is inherited male subfecundity. Pearson and Lee interpret the fact
that the correlation between fertility of
fathers and sons is higher if the analysis
is restricted to marriages of more than 15
years duration as evidence of the “exhaustion” of male fertility (p. 288).

A number of studies of more recent populations have subsequently taken place, but
studies of general pre-transitional historical
populations have been more rare. Langford
and Wilson (1985) used 10,931 evermarried mother-daughter pairs (with the
daughter as the unit of analysis so mothers
could be included more than once), from
reconstitution data from the Cambridge
Group for the History of Population and Social Structure over the period between the
mid-sixteenth to mid-nineteenth centuries.
They concluded that there was no association between the fecundity of mothers and
daughters. Although they computed a small
but nominally statistically significant correlation coefficient of 0.0206, their chi-square
test showed no statistically significant relationship and their small correlation coeffi
cient was heavily influenced by a positive

‘relationship in a single parish of the 14

parishes included.

These data, however, are inevitably
subject to considerable error. Langford
and Wilson draw attention to the fact that
35 per cent of second-generation married
women were recorded as childless as evidence of this error factor. Fewer than 10
per cent of these records had complete information on both mothers and daughters,
but when these 939 complete records
were used, the correlation coefficient increased only slightly to 0.0330, and the
value was not statistically significant.
Moreover, the value of the correlation coefficient is more than halved if the outlier
parish of Earsdon in Northumberland is
removed.

 

 
Vol. 46, No. 1-2

To the extent that the populations from
different parishes are heterogeneous,
combining them might be expected to
generate a positive correlation coefficient.
However, of the 14 individual parishes, 6
actually have negative, albeit small, values for the correlation coefficient of fertility of mothers and daughters. In contrast, there is a correlation coefficient of

_, 0.0968 between the ages of marriage of
& mothers and daughters in the overall sam“ ple, although essentially none with time

This finding of a positive link between
‘= ages of marriage in successive genera> tions was partially replicated in Levine’s
s (1982) analysis of the village of Shep8 shed in Leicestershire. He looked at par& ent/child correlations in age at marriage
E and found that for those married between
& ages 18 to 30, ages chosen to reduce the
undue influence of marriages outside the
prime ages, the father-son correlation was
actually negative at —0.1313 for sons marrying in the period 1825-49 (described as
“remarkably low,” p. 263), and —0.115 for
the middle of the eighteenth century.
Mother-daughter pairs showed a different
pattern with the corresponding values of
—0.0012 and 0.1253, respectively.

tween the fertility of a group of Amish
couples who married in the period
1820-79 in Ohio and Indiana and the sibship sizes of wives and husbands. These
values were described as “small” even
though birth control was not used, suggesting that the relationship was only expected to be observed among noncontraceptors.

Bocquet-Appel and Jakobi (1993)
studied the correlations between various
kin groups, including parents and their
children in the village of Arthez d’Asson
in the French Department of Pyrénées Atlantiques. The population was based on
once-married women in successive generations with intact marriages at age 45 for
both partners, and the older generation
was born between 1744 and 1789 to ensure that the whole period covered was
pre-transitional (the fertility of the
younger generation was centered about
1830). The formal path analytic model is
concerned with wider aspects of intergenerational transmission of fertility. However, they found a very small correlation
(0.015; N = 257) for fertility of parents
and children (sexes were not disaggregated), whereas the value for sibs (0.185;
N = 200) was much larger and statistically
significant. They note that the emphasis on
mother-daughter pairs in previous work
may be misplaced, and they reject a mechanism of intergenerational transmission of
fertility in this pre-transitional period, not
only on empirical grounds, but also on the
theoretical arguments of Jacquard (1977,
1983).

The period from the mid-nineteenth
century has been investigated by Wise
and Condie (1975) and Anderton et al.
(1987). Both used data from the Mormon
Genealogical Library, the former following an initial sample of 402 families with

the wife born between 1825 and 1850,
whose youngest and oldest married children were followed up for the next three
generations, producing samples of 329,
248, and 89 families respectively. Persons
who married more than once in the childbearing phase were excluded from the
analysis. Thus, the sample yielded about
100 marriages in each decade since 1840.
They found that the correlation between
number of children of the marriage and
the size of mothers’ family of orientation
was higher than that for fathers in four of
the five cohorts in the period 1861-70 to
1901-10. However, since that date, fathers’ size of family of orientation was
found to exert a greater influence than
that of mothers (see Figure 2 constructed
from Wise and Condie’s Table 3).

The overall correlations between fertility in the first and second generations was
0.213 and 0.234 with fathers’ and mothers’ families; 0.171 and 0.242 for the second and third generations; but —0.028
and —0.147 for the third and fourth generations. They conclude that there was a
“definite shift toward the tendency for
those from large families to bear small
families and vice versa” (p. 148). This
negative relationship is not replicated in
any other study, apart from two rural
Japanese communities discussed later,
and the interpretation of these results is
complicated for a number of reasons.
Over the study period, the composition of
this population changed from predominantly non-Mormon to Mormon; the
number of observations per decade is relatively small; and the population is selected, being the oldest or youngest child
for a number of generations in a population with large family sizes. No separate
coefficients are given for parents with
youngest or oldest children. The fact that

Murphy

only 89 families in the fourth generation
are available, less than 25 per cent of the
full sample expected from the original
402 families, means that they are likely to
be very disproportionately drawn from the
first-born group generation-by-generation.
If the first birth was at age 20 and the last
at 40, there would be very few last-born
descendants of any generation in the sample. As will be discussed later, birth order
is a variable of considerable significance
in the analysis of the intergenerational
transmission of fertility. I would therefore
give little weight to the later results of
Wise and Condie (1975), especially since
they are out of Iine with a number of more
representative studies covering the same
period.

The study by Anderton et al. (1987)
was based on a similar population to that
of Wise and Condie (1975), although
only one generation was studied: women
born in the period 1830 to 1870 who
married in the age range 10-24, who had
uninterrupted nonpolygamous marriages
up to age 45, and who had at least one
daughter. Similar marriage restrictions
were placed on their daughters. Thus, the
comparison is of the fertility of the older
generation occurring in a broad band
around 1880, with that of the younger
generation occurring in an even broader
band around 1910. However, the basic
sample size consisting of 5,668 mothers
and 8,058 daughters was much larger
than that of Wise and Condie. For some
analyses, the age at marriage restriction
was removed, but full dating of events
was required. Daughters had to have between 2 and 13 children, which gave a
sample of 5,638 linked mother-daughter
pairs.

In this study, the youngest cohort was
childbearing around the 1890’s, and their

daughters were doing so around the
1920’s. Therefore it does provide some
information on the apparent turn-around
for births occurring in the period
1921-30, among which Wise and Condie
found that the correlation coefficient between mothers’ and children’s family
sizes became negative. Although they do
not present correlation coefficients, Anderton et al. (1987) confirmed the positive intergenerational association in the
earlier period and concluded that the relationship of mothers’ to daughters’ fertility
is likely to have arisen mainly through
correlated ages at marriage. Garn (1980)
noted that there is a genetic correlation of
0.2 to 0.3 between ages of menarche of
mothers and daughters.

Anderton et al.’s fertility results (1987,
Table 2) are presented in the form of
cross-tabulations of a three-fold category,
high, medium, and low, for mothers and
daughters. For the earliest 1830-39 cohort of mothers, the X? value of this 3X3
table was 10.65 (4 d.f., based on a total
sample size of 837). For the latest
1860-69 cohort, the corresponding value
was 57.98 (N = 3,445).? Allowing for the
sample size differences, such as using
Pearson’s B statistic, V(X2/N) (Bishop et
al., 1975, p. 380-87), there is a strengthening of the relationship over the period.

*These calculations are not affected by the fact that
the rows and columns of these tables should be reversed.

A crude measure, but one which permits
more direct comparison with other studies, is the correlation coefficient based on
the assumption that the high, medium,
and low groups form an interval scale
(Pearson’s B is identical to the standard
correlation coefficient for a 2X2 table).
The correlation coefficients in these two
cases are 0.058 and 0.118, respectively.
Thus, there is clear evidence that the relationship between fertility of mothers and
daughters actually becomes stronger over
this period, although this fact was not
noted in the paper. Indeed, in a later proportional hazards model, they stated that
“birth cohorts are excluded from the
model to avoid their artificially accounting for variation in other proximate fertility determinants” (p. 477).

EARLY PART OF THE TWENTIETH
CENTURY

Although they do not refer to work by
Pearson et al. (1899), “reproductive selection” underpinned Huestis and Maxwell’s
(1932) analysis of the number of sibs and
mother’s number of sibs of 638 white female students at the University of Oregon.
Their study involved a generally higher
status U.S. population and compared two
generations which practiced increasing
family limitation. The correlation coefficients for the separate urban/rural and total populations were very similar: rural,
0.104; urban, 0.111; total, 0.124. They
conclude that the ‘environment,’ which
they appear to define as the wider socioeconomic situation rather than, for exam

for mothers and daughters in city families seem to have
been transposed. This error has the effect of considerably reducing population heterogeneity.

ple, how the parents treated their children, is the key determinant of average
fertility levels, with biological factors being weak. Pearl (1939), reviewing these
two studies, called the correlations unimpressive and argued that unmeasured factors mean that “a cautious person will
find it impossible to accept this evidence
for the inheritance of human fertility at
prima facie valuation” (p. 36).

Bresard’s (1950) analysis is noteworthy as the first “modern” study using a
contemporary representative sample, although only of males. The study was
based on a much larger sample than
many later sources, collecting information on 45,000 people in France from
3,000 male respondents aged 18 to 50 in
1948. The main focus was on intergenerational occupational mobility, but some
information was presented on the association between respondents’ number of
sibs and the number of fathers’ and mothers’ sibs (collected as number of children
of father and both grandfathers). This
study shows the relationship of childbearing which took place in the early part of
the century with that of childbearing a
generation earlier, centered on the decade
of the 1880’s. For the group of farmers
and peasants (cultivateurs exploitants)
accounting for 34 per cent of the sample
and regarded as one with little intergenerational occupational change, the correlation coefficients were 0.265 (N = 1,035)
for paternal and 0.237 (N = 1,036) for
maternal grandfather’s number of children with the respondent’s number of
sibs.° These father-son correlations were

‘These figures were calculated from Bresard, 1950,
Table XXVI, p. 557. I assumed that the average family
size of 4- or 5-child families was 4.5, and 6.5 for 6-ormore child families. The results are insensitive to the
exact choice.

much higher than those of Pearson et al.
(1899) and also show no clear differential
for the effect of number of mothers’ and
fathers’ sibs on family size. The relationship was even more clear-cut at the extremes of the distribution. For fathers
whose father was an only child, 28 per
cent had only one child (who had to be a
son because of the sample design) and 4
per cent had 6 or more children. For fathers whose father was from a family of
size 6 or more, only 9 per cent had a single son, but 23 per cent had 6 or more
children. Unfortunately, these data cannot
be controlled for age, and it is not possible to calculate correlations for other
groups or for the overall population. On
the other hand, Moberg (1950) found no
clear relationship between the fertility
and sibship sizes of men who matricuJated in 1910 and 1920 in Sweden, but
this study had data problems in that respondents appeared unclear whether or
not they should include themselves in the
number of brothers and sisters.

For a slightly later period of childbearing of the second generation, around the
1920’s and 1930’s, there were studies in
Britain (Berent, 1953) and the United
States (Kantner and Potter, 1954). Both
were based on sample surveys, although
neither was completely random. Berent’s
(1953) results were based on LewisFanning’s 1946-47 hospital-based survey
undertaken for the Royal Commission on
Population of 1,377 couples who were
in their first marriage which was of at
least 15 years duration. Kantner and Potter (1954) used an almost identical sample size from the 1941-42 Indianapolis
study of 1,444 white, native, Protestant,
elementary-school-graduate couples who
married in the period 1927-29, with wife
below age 30 and husband below age 40,

129

and who had lived the majority of their
married lives in a large city. Berent found
that there was a positive correlation between both husbands’ and wives’ families
of orientation and their number of children, and the effect was larger for wives
than for husbands. The overall value of the
correlation coefficient was 0.187, which
Berent referred to as small. Because both
social and biological mechanisms for the
relationship had been proposed, he undertook separate analyses for birth-controllers
and non-birth-controllers. He found that
the correlation was slightly higher for the
former group (0.199) as compared to the
latter (0.174). He also broke the sample
down into three social classes and found the
correlation was somewhat higher (0.219) in
the middle social status of skilled manual
workers than for non-manual workers (r =
0.154) or semi-skilled/unskilled manual
workers (r = 0.143), although none of the
differences were statistically significant.
Thus, the major impression was of similarity, rather than difference, between
groups.

In what appears to have been a direct
response to Berent (1953), Kantner and
Potter (1954) strongly emphasized the
weakness of the relationship (p.
308~309): “... the data [from the Indianapolis study] in some respects are consistent with the hypothesis that the wife’s
family of origin exerts a stronger influence on a couple’s fertility than the husband’s family of origin, but the influence
in both cases is so minor as to make the
comparison fairly meaningless.” They do
not refer to the much more substantial
values reported by Bresard (1950). It
should be noted, however, that their sample was highly selected and had not yet
fully completed childbearing since the interviews took place about 13 years after
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

130

marriage, although they claimed that only
minor changes in family size were likely
to occur. They found a substantial relationship only for families where the number of sibs of husbands and wives were
the same. In this case, the correlation coefficient with children was 0.21 compared with the overall figure of Q.11.
However, with sample sizes of around
1,400 in both of these studies there is
only a marginally statistically significant
difference between the overall correlation
coefficients of the two studies (p < 0.05,
p > 0.01). Given the selected nature of
the Indianapolis sample, the existence of
similar overall magnitudes in the two
countries is plausible. In their conclusions, Kantner and Potter draw attention
to a number of reasons why their findings
are likely to be atypical, such as the divergence in urban/rural and educational
backgrounds of parents and children and
the very unusual 1927-41 study period.
Nevertheless, they conclude (p. 311) that
“while there are definite reasons for expecting the hypothesis [about a positive
relationship between generations] to have
more limited significance among Indianapolis couples than it has had elsewhere, this does not diminish the importance of the conclusion that for a group
such as the one studied here, the paternal
generation exercises very slight influence
on the size of their children’s families.” It
is Open to argument that these caveats do
diminish the significance of this study.
There are other points in the paper that
should be noted. When separate analyses
were performed, the correlation coefficient for the fertility of efficient family
planners with parents’ fertility was 0.09
(also 0.09 with the wife’s family size, but
—0.05 with the husband’s), whereas values for inefficient family planners were

Murphy

Social Biology

described as “negligible,” although the
values were 0.08 and 0.07 for wives and
husbands, respectively (p. 304, Table 8).
There was a negative rather than a positive relationship for large first generation
families, those with 4 or more sibs.

RECENT POPULATIONS

Pearson et al. assumed that the mechanism of transmission was biological rather
than social. They devoted considerable
discussion to the population dynamics implications of differential fertility.* They assumed that biological inheritance must
come through the female line (although
they argued that it could be passed from
grandmothers to granddaughters, through
fathers). The correlation for 1,000 granddaughters and their paternal grandmothers
for members of the peerage, both of whom
had been married for at least 15 years, was
0.1123 (Figure 1). Pearson et al. argued
that this finding reflected transmission
through the intervening (male) generation,
although the correlation between fathers
and sons was much weaker than this
value, and that on theoretical grounds the
correlation between paternal grandmothers
and granddaughters should be half of the
value for mothers and daughters. They
concluded that this finding was confirmed
by their data. Pearson et al.’s paper was
presented two years before Mendel’s clas
‘Unfortunately, he failed to consider the effects of
the proportion of those who do not marry. The considerable attention to the possible assumed harmful effects
of differential fertility in the eugenics and policy debates of the early part of the twentieth century was substantially distorted by failure to consider the effect of
differential nonreproduction. It is interesting to speculate what might have happened if Pearson had emphasized the importance of looking at those who do not
marty, rather than appearing to dismiss it in a simple
footnote stating he found no relationship between family size and propensity to marry.

Erik von Tschermah, and it was much later
before Mendel’s work was put onto a modem footing. The relationship between fathers and sons was partly interpreted as reflecting an attenuated mother-son effect,
since it was actually a parent-son relationship. Pearson et al. did not look at the joint
relationship between fathers and mothers
and their children, nor did Williams and
Williams (1974). The lack of attention to
social factors means that some possible issues cannot be addressed. For example, noble families may have a strong interest in
having a male heir in order to perpetuate
the lineage. Therefore, at the margin, some
differentials might be expected.

Fisher (1930) estimated the genetic
component of fertility using Pearson’s
correlation coefficient of 0.2096 for mothers and daughters, although alternative
pairs would have given him much lower
values (Figure 1). For a wholly genetically determined trait, this covariance
would be half of the variance, giving a
figure of 42 per cent. In addition, the estimate based on grandmother/granddaughter correlation suggested a value of 39 per
cent (Williams and Williams, 1974).

Williams and Williams (1974) only
computed correlation coefficients for fatherson pairs of different generations. These
coefficients fell from 0.168 to 0.036 to
0.021 over the three generations studied,
which were based on the grandparental
generation born in the period 1740 to
1800. This time period was chosen to ensure that the great majority of the grandsons would have completed their fertility
by the 1880’s in order to maximize comparability with Pearson and Lee’s study.
Thus, over time they found that the rela
Fertility of Parents and Children

131

tionship between sibship size and fertility
became less important. However, the overall value for fathers and sons, 0.059, was
almost identical to Pearson’s value of
0.066. Clearly, use of the father-son rather
than mother-daughter data leads to considerably smaller estimated heritability effects. Williams and Williams argued that
previous studies, including Pearson et al.
(1899), which had attempted to estimate
such parameters, were either flawed or
produced nonsignificant results, a finding
they attributed to the fact that the social
environment was the overwhelming determinant. They cited as evidence the fact
that correlations often become attenuated
when controls are made for socioeconomic
variables, and they attributed the reduced
correlation over time in their study to the
fact that the environment was becoming
more changeable in the later period.

A genetic interest underpinned Imaizumi et al.’s (1970) study of about 1,000
families in the rural Japanese community
of Uto in Kumamoto Prefecture which
used record linkage of the official koseki
records. The fertility of five cohorts of
women born between 1881-90 and
1921~30 was compared with the sibship
sizes of their mothers and fathers. The
study included women who were childbearing up to 1966. Imaizumi et al. did
not state whether only married women
were included, but it appears likely. The
data were acknowledged to be incomplete, especially for females, and the
widespread practice of adoption could
bias results, especially in the earlier period. However, the correlations with father’s sibship size were generally small
and, if anything, negative (Figure 3). The
values from the related studies of Neel
and Schull (1972) and Bocquet-Appel and
Jakobi (1993) are also shown in Figure 3,

For mothers, in contrast, there was a shift
from negative to positive over the period
of study. How far this shift reflects data
problems remains unclear, and the avthors were particularly cautious about
the negative values. However, as with
Bocquet-Appel and Jakobi’s (1993) later
Study, there was a consistent positive relationship between the fertility of sibs, although this finding is likely to be due at
least in part to a common shared environment. Neel and Schull (1972) undertook
a broadly similar analysis of the Japanese
island of Hirado but used data from a survey conducted in 1964. They related
childbearing of those having children in
the first three decades of this century to
their sibship sizes, and the overall values

were close to zero, —0.043 (N = 409) for
fathers, and 0.019 (N = 403) for mothers.

Huestis and Maxwell (1932) also downplayed biological aspects compared to
Pearson et al., stating that “family size does
run in families but not to any great degree”
(p. 79). They assumed the primacy of social
mechanisms: “Our conclusion ... is that
family size ... is much more affected by
the environment than by congenital differences in love of children or ability to have
them” (p. 79). They rejected the hypothesis
that there are genetic differences in the
propensity to have children. Huestis and
Maxwell also asserted that women, not
men, are the principal decision-makers with
respect to family size, although no backing
was given for this statement.

Bresard (1950) also emphasized the
role of preferences but did not find the intergeneration fertility relationship a main
topic of interest. Berent (1953) argued
that if there was a transmission of a predisposition to have a particular number of
children, the result would be seen among
successful family planners. However, the
relationship for ever-users and neverusers of contraception within every social
class was very similar. He interpreted the
never-user data as confirming a biological
hereditary component and the ever-user
data as confirming the inheritance of
“family building habits,” but he identified
these correlation coefficients as showing
a “rather small” effect (p. 47).

Kantner and Potter (1954, p. 295) argued that intergenerational transmission in
modern populations was largely determined
by the older generation shaping ideas or instilling preferences about family formation
in the younger generation. This approach
reflected the emerging concentration on
child socialization as a primary mechanism
of transmission of behavior. However, a
major focus of the paper was to emphasize
the weakness of the relationship. They suggest that for populations such as their sample, the socioeconomic characteristics of
the parents and children were very different
in terms of rural/urban residence and education and that this difference might affect
the strength of transmission mechanisms.
They also argued that with less variation in
fertility levels, such effects would be likely
to die away (even though they found the reJationship to be strong only for small family
sizes in the first generation and actually
negative for large family sizes). We argue
later and elsewhere (Murphy and Wang,
1998) that the reverse is actually the case.

In the period around the 1960’s in the
United States, there was considerable at
Fertility of Parents and Children

133

tention paid to the relationship between
parental family size and their children’s
fertility intentions and attitudes, especially
to the extent to which the findings of a
positive association remained after various
socioeconomic controls were included in
the multivariate approach which has come
to dominate quantitative research. If intentions’ data were accurate predictors, they
would permit much more up-to-date
analysis of intergenerational relationships
because these opinions could be used as a
proxy for later fertility. This review will
not emphasize such hypotheses, since their
validity for this purpose is unestablished.
Indeed, paradoxically, there is evidence
that some intergenerationally transmitted
genetic effects are more likely to be observed later in life (McGue et al., 1993).
Moreover, the samples and methods used
make it difficult to compare actual results
with expectations data. What is valuable
from such studies is their ability to generate hypotheses that may be tested with
more suitable data.

Westoff et al.’s (1961) analysis of the
1,165 eligible couples in the 1957 Family
Growth in Metropolitan America study
had similar restrictions to those in the Indianapolis study. In addition, their study
was confined to women of at least parity
two. This further restriction makes comparisons with other sources problematic.
Nonetheless, Westoff et al. (1961, pp.
287-292) found correlation coefficients
of 0.11 and 0.10 for number of children
desired and number of sibs for husbands
and wives, respectively (N = 938). They
concluded that the relationship was likely
to be stronger if the woman had experienced satisfactory childhood experiences,
a theme that was to become of major interest. When this sample was reinterviewed later in 1960, there were positive

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

134

correlations of 0.08 and 0.04 between
number of sibs and of wife and husband
and number of pregnancies since the second birth (Westoff et al., 1963, p. 204).
The sample was reinterviewed in 196266, and the regression coefficient for completed parity on wife’s number of sibs was
0.04, but increased to 0.06 after controlling for education and age at marriage
(Bumpass and Westoff, 1970, p. 91).
Duncan et al. (1965) included information about expected family size from
2,713 white wives aged 18-39 living with
their husbands from the Growth of American Families (GAF) 1955 Survey and
also their live births by survey date together with 8,300 wives aged 27-46 with
the same characteristics, and a further
4,000 wives aged 47-61 in 1962 from the
Current Population Survey (CPS). They
found a positive linear relationship between successive generations’ fertility,
but no differences in the effect of fathers
and mothers or suggestions of a curvilinear relationship. The relationship was
stronger for the older CPS cohort, but the
younger group is affected by censoring of
experience. They presented regression coefficients, rather than correlation coefficients, and since the variance in parent’s
sibship size is larger than that of children’s fertility, correlation coefficients
will be larger than the regression coefficients.’ For the older cohort, the simple regression coefficients are 0.111 for wives’
number of siblings and 0.101 for husbands’ siblings. For the younger cohort,

"The simple linear regression coefficient is given by
ro,/o,. In practice, the standard deviation is similar to
the corresponding mean, so a reasonable approximation
is to use the ratio of numbers of sibs and children. For
the 27-47 year-old CPS sample, the value computed
from Table 2 is 1.61, and the regression coefficient is
0.099.

the values were 0.061 and 0.070, respectively. In their samples, inclusion of educational level, farm background, and duration of marriage reduces the magnitude
of the sibling regression coefficient by
about half for the older cohort and twothirds for the younger group (where they
noted that this will also reflect timing influences). While there are arguments for
controlling for educational level and farm
background, the assumption that duration
of marriage 1s somehow independent of
“fertility” is questionable. If there is a
propensity for fertility to be transmitted
intergenerationally, difference in marriage
is the primary mechanism through which
it would be expected to operate as Anderton et al. (1987) noted. While Duncan et
al. (1965, p. 514) acknowledged the possibility that intergenerational transmission
could involve “physical inheritance of
some trait associated with low fecundity
(e.g., blood type)”, socialization mechanisms were emphasized, and they suggested that intergenerational stability was
necessary for such mechanisms to operate. While they reported that the relationship was stronger than average among
“fecund planners,” the implications of this
finding for how the relationship might
evolve over time is not explored.
Hendershot (1969) followed up Duncan et al.’s (1965) hypothesis that socialization was the key mechanism for transferring fertility through generations. He
argued that this pattern was more likely
to be observed in children who were “‘satisfied” with their upbringing and who
were “conformist.” The sample was
highly selected, 389 freshmen women in
Midwest liberal arts colleges, a largely
upper middle-class group. He concluded
that attitudes to family size were positively related to parent’s family size, but

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

Vol. 46, No. 1-2

also that this relationship was stronger
among women who felt closer to their
families and was stronger for first-born
women. Westoff and Potvin’s (1967) survey of 15,000 freshmen and _ senior
women in U.S. colleges, which showed
that for all religious groups, especially
Catholics, there was a direct linear relationship between number of siblings and
desired family size, reinforced this conclusion. One interesting aspect of Hendershot’s study was that conformism was assumed to be more common among
first-born women and the relationship was
found to be stronger among first-born
women. However, McAllister et al. (1974),
using a sample of 635 tenth-graders (male
and female) from four Southern counties
(a generally lower socioeconomic status
group), found no relationship between size
of family of orientation or a special role for
first-borns. They were able to replicate
Hendershot’s results only for the comparable group of white females who expected
to attend college. Thus, they concluded that
such continuities are likely to be found
only in selected groups where little change
in lifestyle is anticipated.

Johnson and Stokes’ (1976) analysis,
based on 901 women who had been followed up since being sophomores in rural
Pennsylvania high schools in 1947, deserves special attention. They were oncemarried and living with their husbands in
1971, and almost all were aged 40 to 44
years. Information had been collected on
number of sibs in 1947 which was related
to the number of their own children (including those who were childless).
Analyses were presented mainly in the
form of regression models, but the standardized regression coefficients were
simple Pearson product moment correlation coefficients that may be compared

with other studies. The overall correlation
coefficient was 0.140, and number of sibs
was described as “weakly related to marital fertility, particularly when compared
to the influences of other variables” (p.
181), although no other coefficients were
presented. In part, this conclusion was
based on the fact that the regression coefficient was 40 per cent lower than the
correlation coefficient. However, this
finding simply reflected the ratio of standard deviations of the distribution of fertility of the two generations (Murphy and
Wang, 1998).

This study population had many advantages: the number with completed fertility was large; the population was relatively homogeneous, but not at the
extremes of the socio-economic continuum; and longitudinal information was
available. Johnson and Stokes provided
both theoretical arguments and empirical
evidence that the relationship was
stronger for three particular groups: firstborns, for whom the correlation coefficient was 0.256 compared with 0.132 for
later-borns; those with similar lifestyles
to their parents (operationalized as the
closeness of number of years of schooling) for whom the correlation was 0.218
compared with 0.118 for the change
group; and those who had expressed satisfaction with their family life at age 16 (r
= 0.175 compared with 0.022 for the dissatisfied). For first-borns without a change
in lifestyle, the correlation coefficient was
0.419. However, while less than one-quarter had no change in lifestyle, over 80 per
cent expressed themselves as satisfied.
The link between size of family of orientation and fertility was once more confirmed, at least for women, and the “sociological” explanation that satisfaction with
life as a child is the key mechanism which
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

136

underpins the relationship was consistent
with many of the more general theories
of the importance of the socialization of
children.

Since the primary focus in this review
is on demographic factors, attention will
be concentrated on the birth order variable. The fact that the reported correlation coefficient for first-born women is
twice the value for later-born women is
striking. The theoretical justification is
based on the greater conformity associated with first-born children (Schachter,
1964; see also Sulloway, 1996). However,
these comparisons do not control size of
family. For Johnson and Stokes’ study
population the average number of sibs of
those who are first-born (just over two) is
only half the number of sibs of the laterborn. All of those from one-child families
are first-born, but only one-in-ten of
those in a ten-child family. For a laterborn child, none are from a one-child
family, and there is a 90 per cent chance
that a child from a 10-child family will
be later-born. Thus, the interpretation of a
birth order effect will tend to be confounded with family size unless the relationship is linear across all birth orders.
This point is also relevant to the interpretation of Wise and Condie’s (1975) results,
in addition to the over-representation of
first-borns discussed earlier.

The pervasive influences of economic
models at this time was also evident, especially the Easterlin approach which appears to give a particular emphasis to the
childhood environment as an influence on
subsequent behavior. Ben-Porath (1975)
used this framework as the basis for investigating the relationship between generations, particularly the role of income.
The data source was the 1968-70 files of
the Panel Study of Income Dynamics

Social Biology

(PSID). The analysis was based mainly
on 973 white non-Catholic wives aged 35
and over. Catholics and Blacks were rejected because it was stated that their fertility could not be regarded as approximately completed (no controls for age
were included in the analysis), although
they also appear to conform less well to
the economic rationality model proposed.
The correlation coefficient between number of wife’s siblings and children was
0.177 (very similar in absolute magnitude
to the correlation coefficients for husband’s and wife’s education and number
of children of —0.194 and of —0.159, respectively). Although the first sentence of
the paper’s abstract states that the predicted income of the husband’s father is
inversely related to the family’s number of
children, the t-statistic for this variable is
only 0.96 (p = 0.34) when farm background is included in the paper’s final
analysis (Table 6), a very weak relationship. However, the number of wife’s siblings variable remains much stronger (¢ =
1.89, p = 0.059). Thus, on the basis of this
empirical analysis, the role of economic
factors would appear to be inconsequential
compared with number of sibs.’

Duncan et al. (1965) had suggested
that stability of lifestyle might promote
intergenerational transmission of fertility.
Anderton et al. (1987) accepted the socialization framework, but noted that the
role of the family appeared to be more
important than external influences and
that the key factor was relative rather
than absolute fertility (i.e., if the mother
had below average fertility compared

"The model does not allow for the fact that the
number of children will also affect the child’s standard
of living. Easterlin assumes that it is the children’s experience, not their parents’, which is relevant.

with her peers, then her daughter was
also likely to do so). They reflect the dismissive attitude to biological mechanisms
stating that “Early studies .. . even attributed transmission of fertility norms and
preferences to heredity.’ Kantner and
Potter (1954) were quoted to show the
negligible relationship compared with
Berent’s “weak” results. However, as argued earlier, these values probably do not
differ significantly at the 1 per cent level.
In their review of contemporary studies,
Anderton et al. (1987, p. 468) used
“weak” four times, “modest” twice, and
“negligible” once to categorize the nature
of the relationship, with nothing to suggest
the existence of any substantial effect. In a
systematic investigation of relative explanatory power of different types of variables, Murphy (1987) considered 15 aspects of family formation for women aged
30-39 and 40-49 in the 1976 British Family Formation Survey (Dunnell, 1979). The
variable of number of wife’s and husband’s sibs combined was found to be statistically significantly related to 63 per
cent (N = 19) of these women. A series of
17 variables measuring various aspects of
socioeconomic status, educational level
and employment experiences were constructed, and 15 of these 17 had lower
scores than the sibs variable. The two with
higher values referred to the current (i.e.,
post-reproductive) status of the woman.
However, even if variables related to
socialization factors, including stability
of lifestyle and childhood satisfaction,
are related to subsequent fertility, this
finding would not mean that the causal
role of socialization had been confirmed,
unless it can be shown how socialization
is correlated to the genetic and environmental backgrounds of the “biological”
and “sociological” parents. The only de

signs that would provide discrimination
between such factors do not lie in evermore detailed replications of panel or
longitudinal studies, but rather designs
such as those of twin and adoption studies that permit the relative contribution of
genes, environment, and their interaction
to be determined. A recent study based on
Danish twins born in the period 1900-23
suggests a substantial genetic component
to fertility (Kohler et al., 1999).

More recently, attention has been given
to this topic as an aspect of intergenerational relations and social policy aspects
of an aging society. Pullum and Wolf
(1991) present data on correlations between living sibs and children for Canada,
using the 1985 General Social Survey for
5-year age groups from 55~59 to 85+
based on sample sizes of about 400 in
each age group. The largest correlation coefficients, about 0.32, are for those around
age 60, with values declining at older
ages. However, since these figures are
based on living sibs, death of siblings will
increasingly affect values. U.S. data from
the Longitudinal Study of Aging are for
sisters and daughters only, with correlation
coefficients typically just under 0.1 and
therefore not comparable with other data
discussed here. Pullum and Wolf also present correlation coefficients from the
1981-82 German Life History Survey for
ever-born siblings and children for cohorts
born 1949-51 (who will not have completed childbearing) of 0.2127 for the
1939-41 cohort (N = 727) and 0.1552 for
the 1929-31 cohort (V = 709). They also
quote a 1974 study from Israel of women
aged 35 and over for whom the correlation
coefficient is 0.286 (N = 708). However,
over one-third of this sample was of Asian
or African ancestry with much higher average levels of fertility than the others
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

138

which is likely to inflate correlation coeffictents (Danziger and Neuman, 1989).

Two additional sets of results will now
be presented. Table 1 shows data from
the 1976 British Family Formation, giving the relationship of the fertility of
women with the number of their own and
their partner’s sibs, and the number of
sibs for all women regardless of their
marital status. The influences of husbands’ and wives’ family sizes are essentially equal, and there is no evidence of
change in the strength of the relationship
over time. However, correlation coefficients are considerably larger if the average of husbands’ and wives’ sibs is used
rather than each taken separately. This
finding holds true even when the number
of sibs is different. Perhaps surprisingly,
the correlation for all women is slightly
larger than for women with a partner (the
great majority of whom were husbands).

Table 2 shows correlations from the
1987-88 U.S. National Survey of Families
and Households (NSFH) for number of
children and number of sibs with whom
the respondent lived while growing up.
This table shows an increase in the correlation coefficient value for younger cohorts, the value for the youngest cohort
being twice that for the oldest one shown.
For these two recent data sources, the correlation coefficients are mostly in the
range 0.15 to 0.20.

CONCLUSIONS

Figure 4 and Table 3 show the trend in reported correlations between number of siblings and children for the majority of studies
discussed earlier. There is a clear tendency
for the value to increase steadily over time.

Thus, for parental generations born in
a band about the middle of the nineteenth

Murphy

Social Biology

century and for a second generation born
around the turn of the century, a large
number of studies based on different data
sources report correlation coefficients between numbers of parents and children.
These dates are approximate, in that, for
example, children born about 1900 are assumed to have parents born around 1870.
In the case of broad age coverage such as
the Berent (1953) study, women covered
the age range from about 35 in 1946, and
it is assumed that their birth dates were
around 1900 on average. Taken as a
whole, these data show a high level of
consistency with values of about 0.15 for
countries such as the United States and
Britain, but higher values for the particular French population, and similar values
for those bearing children up to the
1940’s. However, for the 1960’s, values
around 0.2 are more typical. The largest
reported values are from France, Canada,
and Israel, and values appear to be increasing over recent periods.
This paper has summarized the demographic and related literature over the
past hundred years on the topic of the
correlation of fertility between parents
and children and highlighted a number of
issues that will be summarized here.

TRENDS OVER TIME

No definitive answer can be given
about the strength of the relationship in
pre-transitional historical populations
since there is some doubt about the quality of the reconstitution data such as
those used by Langford and Wilson
(1985), but both empirical evidence and
theoretical arguments suggest that the
value was close to Zero. Occasional studies have reported a decline in the strength
of the relationship with time (Williams
and Williams, 1974; Wise and Condie,

However, Pearson et al.’s differentials between males and females are so out of
line with other studies as to suggest either
a very highly selected population or some
systematic bias in their data. The suggestion by Kantner and Potter (1954) that
there appears to be an interaction term
when fathers and mothers come from the
same size families remains an untested
hypothesis. Such considerations raise the
more general point of the role of homogamy on population dynamics. Effects
tend to be greater in cases where the children’s characteristics do not differ substantially from their parents, such as children who have broadly similar levels of
education to their parents (and an addi
tional hypothesis is that this would be
even stronger if the parents themselves
were alike in their characteristics). Intergenerational similarity of lifestyle tends to
increase the strength of the observed relationship, but whether the relationship can
be explained in terms of a particular proximate determinant such as intergenerational continuities in age at start of childbearing remains unclear. Only relatively
few studies have considered the role of
marriage, but Anderton et al. (1987) suggest that observed correlations in fertility
between generations are largely a consequence of similarity in ages at marriage.
Most “biological” analyses have implicitly assumed that fecundability is the key
parameter, with the role of other intermediate fertility variables not considered.

OTHER SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC INFLUENCES

Work on birth order effects provides
further insights into possible mechanisms
at work (Johnson and Stokes, 1976). The
particular time period over which the
analysis was undertaken and the possible
specialized nature of the population used
raises the question of how far these findings hold in the wider context. One topic
that has not been addressed is the pattern
of nonmarriage according to size of family of orientation. In some of the historical
populations considered here, perhaps a
third of women may never have married,
and in the early twentieth century only
one-half may have had more than a single

child. If mother-daughter correlations
were thought to be relevant to discussion
of population dynamics, then inclusion of
nonbreeders would be important. Most
studies have confined the second generation to married couples, usually those in
intact first marriages, but such restrictions
are no longer tenable within the fluid
lifestyles experienced today.

The relationship is becoming stronger
in developed societies, but this conclusion is mainly based on comparing completed fertility of the younger generation
with that of their parents, rather than
analysis of contemporary childbearing.
Younger generations are now more likely
to adopt an individualistic approach to

demographic decisions. Moreover, the
pace of socioeconomic change would be
expected to attenuate any intergenerational trends (Lesthaeghe and Meekers,
1986). On the other hand, the a la carte
menu of this epoch following the Second
Demographic Transition, and the wider
set of options available, could provide an
extended social space for such patterns to
manifest themselves.

RESEARCH DESIGNS

Little attention has been given to the
relationship of fertility between sibs, apart
from the genetically-orientated studies of
Imaizumi et al. (1970) and BocquetAppel and Jakobi (1993). However, if a
mechanism generates similarities between
parents and children, then it should also
generate a correlation between sibs. The
literature on birth order tends to assume
that differences are due to socialization in
that, for example, first-born girls from
large families in the past may have been
reluctant to follow their mother’s footsteps because they had to undertake childcare responsibilities. With smaller families, this factor may be less relevant.

One key issue that has still not been
satisfactorily addressed is the hypothesis
dismissed by Huestis and Maxwell (1932)
that there may be an inherited (i.e., genetic) propensity to have a given family
size (p. 77): “... there are probably genetic differences in the desire for children
as well as the ability to have them, comparable to differences in height, body
build and the like.” In contrast to earlier
work which assumed that any relationship
was likely to be found only in noncontracepting populations, it is plausible that it
will be manifested in _post-transitional
ones and that any genetic mechanism will
be behavioral rather than physiological.

Murphy

Social Biology

However, none of the studies considered
so far, including longitudinal ones, apart
from Kohler and Christensen, are able to
distinguish between genetic and socialization factors and their interactions. One
possible way to address this issue, in addition to the classic twin and adoption
studies, would be to look at the outcomes
for sibs of different levels of genetic similarity if there are sufficient numbers who
are brought up in different environments.
The most obvious group to study might
be the children of men who have children
by more than one partner.

For contemporary industrialized populations, biological ability (or fecundability) is relevant as a topic of study only in
interaction with behavioral factors, such
as the reduced ability of women who
choose to start childbearing at older ages
to be able to do so. Age at first marriage
has been found to be an important proximate determinant of the correlation between generations’ as has familial satisfaction. One is a proximate and the other
a remote determinant, and their relationship could be clarified. However, early
age at marriage is also associated with
parental divorce. In developed countries
such as Britain, more couples now divorce than have three or more children,
so that partnership behavior itself may be
a major confounding factor.

SCIENTIFIC CONTEXT

The attention and explanations given
to the relationship between fertility of
successive generations mirrors the prevailing scientific orthodoxies of the pe
°As with most fertility studies, the proximate determinants framework is a natural one to adopt. To do so
might clarify many of the issues raised in the literature
discussed here. ‘

riod. Pearson et al. were interested in biological inheritance at a time when eugenic
issues were emphasized. In the 1940's
and 1950's, interest in family planning led
to work on differences between users and
nonusers of contraception, with an assumption that the analysis of these groups
separately would lead to differentiation
of “biological” and “social” influences.
There was also a move to downplay intergenerational differences. However, intergenerational fertility transmission was
later absorbed within the boundaries of
socialization theory, and rather than being
interpreted as a biological phenomenon, it
was used as evidence to show that early
socialization of children tended to be repeated in the following generation. Indeed, size of family of orientation appeared sometimes to be considered only a
noisy proxy indicator for the parents’
norms and attitudes that were passed
down through their children.

The repeated tendency for authors to
refer to the small value of the intergenerational effect has already been discussed.
Nonetheless, Berent (1953) shows that the
average number of children for women in
the highest sibship group (14 per cent of
the sample) had an average of 4.41 children, compared with 2.63 for those in the
smallest group (12 per cent of the sample). Any classification which found such
differences between broad groups would
usually be described as substantial in the
context of contemporary fertility studies.
However, the differences arise from an
underlying relationship that in itself is described as small. The reason may be that
those researchers undertook most analysis
from tabular material where differences
between groups were discussed. Microlevel calculations were rarely undertaken
(Pearson refers to having spent a week

Fertility of Parents and Children

 

143

with a colleague to calculate two correlation coefficients!), and the fact that apparently small micro-level differences lead to
large differences in tabulated data was insufficiently appreciated.

Kincade Oppenheimer (1994) has
pointed out that part of the popularity of
variables such as female employment and
education in current demographic analysis
is that they are seen as positive in themselves and compatible with other desirable
outcomes such as female autonomy. The
stress on the weakness of the relationship
contrasts with most other areas where researchers are anxious to emphasize the
strength of the relationships found, suggesting a preference in many cases for alternative explanations. Most social scientists have been traditionally suspicious of
biological and genetic explanations. Even
analysis of intergenerational socialization
factors, such as the effects of children’s
experiences on subsequent behavior, is
largely confined to groups defined as
“problematic,” such as teenage and single
mothers whose life is assumed to be determined by their backgrounds. I suspect that
relatively few people (including this author) would subscribe to hypotheses about
intergenerational fertility behavior such as
that of Potts (1997, p. 5): “... we know
that hundreds of millions of people ...
have chosen to have fewer than two children. It would not be implausible to argue
that such people are genetically different
with respect to wanting children from, say,
Nigerians who have six children.”

Relatively little attention has been
given to the role of transmission of fertility from the viewpoint of evolutionary biology, which has been useful in showing
the impact of biological factors in core
demographic areas of interest such as
mortality (Christensen and Vaupel, 1996)

and partnership (McGue and Lykken,
1992). This lack is strange to the extent
that such approaches are driven by the
concept of biological fitness, i.e., the capacity to reproduce successfully. If one
group had a high propensity to reproduce,
and this propensity were inherited, then
in a long-term fixed demographic regime,
such a group would eventually come to
be numerically dominant. It appears that
such a propensity would not easily have
been expressed in earlier periods, not
only because the stochastic variability of
birth processes was such as to overwhelm
such a tendency, but also because of theoretical arguments such as those posed by
Jacquard (1977; 1983). However, these
arguments may not hold for contemporary populations.

For studies with reliable data, there is
a clear tendency for a positive association
to be found which is of greater substantive import than often claimed. Moreover,
there is as yet no evidence for the wither

ing away of this relationship, but rather
the reverse. This result is in contrast to
many of the “traditional” variables such
as religion or urban/rural residence where
effects do appear to have declined or disappeared. Whether or not the relationship
is “weak” and disappearing should continue to be examined in contemporary
populations.
