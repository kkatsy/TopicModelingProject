ABSTRACT: Selective placement is the process of matching adoptive parents to adopted children
with respect to particular characteristics. Previous studies of selective placement have been
limited with respect to the variables examined as well as sources of information. The present
study examined both physical and behaviora) data on 206 “first” adoptions, including information
on birth fathers and birth mothers, their parents, infant adoptees, and adoptive parents. Results
indicate that physical as well as behavioral characteristics are used in selective placement,
although the absolute level of selective placement is low. Selective placement based on education
and occupation of the birth parents’ parents is not greater than selective placement based on
education and occupation of the birth parents themselves. Characteristics of infant adoptees are
not important factors in selective placement. To the extent that selective placement occurs for
behavioral and physical characteristics, our data suggest that it is based largely on characteristics

of the birth father.

Despite the theoretical and social importance of knowing whether adopted children are, or should be, matched to their
adoptive parents, no systematic research
has focused solely on the issue of selective
placement in adoption. The theoretical
importance of selective placement derives
from its impact on estimates of genetic and
environmental parameters in behavioral
genetic studies using the adoption design
(DeF ries and Plomin, 1978). Its social importance lies in knowing what we are, or
should be, doing with respect to about 1
per cent of all births in the United
States—children adopted in infancy by
nonrelatives (Mech, 1973). As HardyBrown et al. (in press) have recently
noted, selective placement may be either
beneficial or detrimental to child development if genotype-environment interactions are important, with the direction of
the effect depending on the nature of the
interaction. The purpose of this article is
to report an extensive analysis of current

selective placement based on behavioral
and physical characteristics of birth parents, adoptive parents, and infant adoptees.

Previous studies have considered selective placement only as a by-product of
behavioral genetic analyses of adoption
data (reviewed by Munsinger, 1975; DeFries and Plomin, 1978). These studies differ from ours in four ways. First, each
considered only one or two variables, typically education or occupation. Second, information about education and occupation
was obtained for the birth parents themselves but not for their parents. Because
many birth parents are young adults, and
their educational and occupational status
may not predict ultimate socioeconomic
status as well as it can be predicted from
the status of their parents, this may be a
critical consideration. Third, previous
studies focused on the birth mother and
rarely included birth fathers. Finally, no
previous study considered the possible use

of information on the infant adoptee (such
as gestational age and early health status)
in selective placement.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Anonymous information was recorded
for a sample of 206 “first” adoptions that
were finalized during 1967~—78 at a large
adoption agency (Lutheran Social Services) in Denver, Colorado. Although
selective placement practices almost certainly vary among adoption agencies, the
Lutheran Social Services in Denver,
which has a national reputation for being
trend-setting and progressive, is likely to
be representative of large, modern agencies. We collected data involving adoptees euphemistically known as “easilyplaced”—-Caucasian children with no
known problems. Such children are typically adopted by one month of age.

For the birth parents and the adoptive
parents of the 206 adoptees, we recorded
physical information (height, weight, eye
color, hair color, skin color) and behavioral information (educational level and
occupation). For the birth parents, we also
recorded the education and occupation of
their parents. The birth fathers reported
their own data in one-third of the sample;
for the rest, the birth mother gave us the
information about the father. Previous
analyses indicated no difference between
these two sources of data (Plomin et al.,
1977). Mean ages (+S.D.) at the time of the
adopted infant’s birth were: 22.3 + 5.2 for
birth fathers; 20.8 + 4.1 for birth mothers; 31.3 + 4.4 for adoptive fathers; and
29.1 + 3.5 for adoptive mothers. For the
adoptees, we recorded maturity at birth
(height, head circumference, gestational
age), APGAR ratings of the neonate’s condition (heart rate, respiratory rate, muscle
tone, grimace, color) at 1 minute and 5
minutes after delivery, time in hospital,
time in foster care, and sex.

Social Biology

Our analyses focused on the relationship
between characteristics of the birth parents (or their parents) and those of the
adoptive parents, as well as on the relationship between infant characteristics
and those of the adoptive parents. We
were also interested in two subsidiary issues: the relative weight placed on characteristics of the birth and adoptive mothers
vs. fathers in selectively placing adopted
children, and possible temporal changes in
selective placement during the past decade.

RESULTS

Table 1 lists selective placement correlations for education and occupation, i.e.,
correlations of characteristics of birth parents and their parents with those of the
adoptive parents. In general, the results
indicate some selective placement. The
average weighted correlations for the birth
parent—adoptive parent comparisons are
0.19 for education and 0.13 for occupation. A recent large-scale study by Teasdale (1979) reported similar correlations
based on the occupational status of the
birth parents and the adoptive father. The
correlations involving the birth parents’
parents are in general lower than those for
the birth parents themselves. Thus, it appears that socioeconomic information on
the young birth parents is used to some
extent for selective placement, even
though such information about their parents might be more indicative of the birth
parents’ ultimate socioeconomic status.

Table 2 presents selective placement
correlations for physical characteristics of
the birth parents and adoptive parents.
Selective placement for height is substantia) (a correlation of 0.20, on the average,
between birth parents and adoptive parents). The average correlations for other
physical characteristics are: weight, 0.12,
eye color, 0.14; hair color, 0.16; and skin

as behavioral characteristics of the birth
parents and adoptive parents.

Is information on birth characteristics of
infant adoptees used in selectively placing
them into adoptive homes? It may be seen

in Table 3 that there is no evidence for
selective placement of easily placed infant
adoptees on the basis of these measures.
Except for the negative correlation between infant’s length of stay in the hospital
and adoptive mother’s occupation, characteristics of the infants are not significantly

related to education or occupation of
either adoptive parent. The average selective placement correlation in Table 3 is
0.002. When correlations between the
adoptive parents’ physical characteristics
and these infant variables were computed,
they were found to be no higher than any
of the correlations in this table and were
also not significant. Thus, the failure of
previous studies to consider characteristics
of the adopted children may not be an
important oversight in studies of infant
adoptees, although it is clearly important
in studies of older adopted children
(Freeman et al., 1928).

Closer examination of Tables 1 and 2
indicates that selective placement correlations between birth fathers and adoptive
fathers tend to be higher than those between mothers for both behavioral and
physical characteristics. The highest correlation is 0.37 for height of birth father and
adoptive father. The next highest correlation (0.29) was found when educational
levels of the birth fathers and the adoptive
fathers were compared. Averaged across
both adoptive parents, the average selective placement correlation for education is
0.26 for birth fathers and 0.14 for birth
mothers. Averaged across both birth par
ents, the average selective placement correlation is 0.25 for adoptive fathers and
0.14 for adoptive mothers. Although this
pattern does not exist for occupation, it
does occur with respect to the physical
characters, especially height. These data
suggest that previous studies which focused on mothers rather than fathers may
have underestimated selective placement.
They also suggest the interesting hypothesis that social workers view characteristics
of males as more important than those of
females.

Hierarchical multiple regression analyses (Cohen and Cohen, 1975) were conducted in order to test this hypothesis and
also to examine temporal trends in selective placement. The dependent variable in
each analysis was a behavioral or physical
characteristic of the adoptive mother or
father. One independent variable was the
same characteristic for the birth mother;
another was the same characteristic for the
birth father. In addition to characteristics
of the birth mothers and fathers, independent variables included the adoptee’s year
of birth and the first-order and secondorder interactions between the adoptee’s
year of birth and the birth mother’s and
father’s characteristics. The hierarchical

Vol. 26, No. 1

multiple regression analyses entered the
main effects of the birth mother’s and
father’s characteristics and adoptee’s year
of birth in the first step, the first-order
interactions in the second step, and the
second-order interactions in the third step.
These analyses were based on those cases
with complete data for each variable. In
none of the eight regression analyses
(which predicted education, occupation,
height, or weight of either adoptive
mother or adoptive father) was the birth
mother’s characteristic found to be a significant predictor. The birth father’s
characteristic, however, was found to be
an important predictor (p < 0.05) in five
of the regressions. It predicted either
adoptive parent’s education, adoptive
father’s height, and either adoptive parent’s weight. These results indicate that,
to the extent that selective placement occurs for behavioral and physical characteristics, it is based largely on characteristics of the birth father. In other words,
there is relatively little selective placement
based on the birth mother’s data independent of information on the birth father. In
analyses of education, occupation, and
height, the multiple R? was higher when
predicting scores of adoptive fathers than
mothers, again suggesting that more emphasis is placed on characteristics of male
parents.

A significant first-order interaction between a characteristic of the birth parents
and adoptee’s year of birth would indicate
a temporal change in selective placement.
There were no such general indications of
change. However, with respect to education, the results suggested a diminished

reliance on information about birth fathers
in selective placement. Correlations between birth father’s education and adoptive parents’ education decreased significantly during this period.

DISCUSSION

Previous studies of selective placement
considered only behavioral characteristics
such as education and occupation. They
obtained information on these variables
for the young birth parents themselves,
but not for their parents; they focused on
birth mothers rather than birth fathers;
and they did not consider characteristics of
the infant adoptees. We found that physical as well as behavioral characteristics
are used in selective placement, although
the absolute level of selective placement is
low. Concerning the second issue, information about the education and occupation of the birth parents’ parents is used
even less in selective placement than are
these characteristics of the birth parents
themselves. The third issue turned out to
be important: Selective placement seems
to be based more on the characteristics of
the birth fathers than on those of the birth
mothers. Finally, characteristics of easily
placed infant adoptees do not seem to be
important factors in selective placement.
