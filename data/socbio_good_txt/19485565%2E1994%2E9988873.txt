Influence of Cause-of-Death Structure
on Age Patterns of Mortality in Mauritius

ABSTRACT: Over the period 1969-86, Mauritian mortality declined rapidly, accompanied by
substantial change in its age pattern of mortality and cause-of-death structure. Using cause-ofdeath data for this period, this paper studies the influence of cause-of-death structure on age
patterns of mortality. Infectious and parasitic diseases had marked influence on age patterns of
mortality for young Mauritian males, while circulatory causes of death influenced the age pattern
of mortality for older Mauritian males. For females, their unique age pattern of mortality
remained unique, largely because of the uniform and smooth change in cause-of-death structure.

Mauritius is a small island of approximately 720 square miles situated
in the Indian Ocean, 500 miles east of
Madagascar and some 1,000 miles from
the southeast coast of Africa. In 1987,
the population was about one million,
made up of three broad population
groups: the Indo-Mauritians, the SinoMauritians, and the “General Population.”” The Indo-Mauritians, comprised of immigrants from India and
their descendants, make up about 66
per cent of the population, while the
Sino-Mauritians, comprised of immigrants from China and their descendants make up about 3 per cent. The

_remaining population, about 31 per

cent, is known as the “General Population,” made up of persons of European or African or mixed descent.
The Island of Mauritius has experienced one of the most spectacular declines in mortality in the Third World,
yet does not receive as much attention
as states like Kerala (India) or Sri
Lanka. In four decades, from 1942-46
to 1982-84, life expectancy at birth in

Mauritius increased from 32.8 to 64.38
years for males and from 33.8 to 71.23
years for females. This sharp decline in
mortality was accompanied by a drastic
shift in cause of death structure. This
paper aims to describe the influence
that this change in cause-of-death
structure had on the age patterns of
mortality. The study period extends
from 1969 to 1986, a period during
which Mauritian mortality experienced
transitional changes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data used for the analysis was
obtained from censuses and from vital
Statistics on causes of death. In Mauritius, data on death and other vital statistics is collected by the Registrar
General’s Department, which by 1982
maintained 48 Civil Status Offices located throughout the country. Mauritius is known to have a tradition of very
good birth and death registration statistics as well as censuses. According to
the UN (1982, p. 2):

Research and evaluation by national
and international organizations have
shown that recent censuses in Mauritius
have been quite accurate . . . Civil registration of vital events is compulsory
and in the last few decades, with the exception of marriages, has been nearly
complete.
In the case of mortality, the completeness of death registration has been confirmed again using an independent analytic technique. Using the technique
of Bennet and Horiuchi (1981), Bah
(1992a) estimated that for the intercensal period 1972-83, death registration for males was 100 per cent complete while for females it was 98.6 per
cent complete. While registration of vital events has been compulsory for several decades, medical certification of
causes of death only became compulsory for all districts in 1982 (CSO,
1988). The statistics of causes of death
from Mauritius are submitted to the
data bank of WHO in Geneva from
which the data set used in this study
was obtained.

The causes of death tn that data
bank are classified according to the
code of the International Classification
of Diseases (ICD). Over the period under study, two versions of the International Classification of Diseases were
used; the eighth revision of the ICD
(ICD-8), from 1969-80; and the ninth
revision (ICD-9), from 1981 to 1986.
As those classifications were very detailed, it was necessary to regroup the
causes of death into meaningful categories for subsequent analysis. Following the lead of previous studies in
cause-of-death analysis, I used eleven
groups of causes in the analysis, including all causes combined and the residual group of all other causes, “‘all others.” The final list and their equivalent

Cause of Death Structure

codes in ICD-8 and ICD-9 are given
in Table 1. For each of these eleven
groups of causes, the age-standardized
cause-specific death rate was computed
separately for gender for each year.
The unit of analysis used was one year.
Hence, for the period extending from
1969 to 1986, the total number of data
points used in the analysis, by gender,
was 18. In analyzing a long-term series
of cause-of-death data, the problem of
change in ICD is often encountered. In
such a situation, the problems of comparability caused by the revisions of
the ICD are minimized by grouping the
causes of death into large categories as
has been done in this case.

To describe the influence of causeof-death structure on age patterns of
mortality, the method employed is to
relate two measurable quantities, one
reflecting causes of death and the other
reflecting age patterns of mortality.
According to Preston (1976), the two

quantities which are measurable and

which are also mathematically related
are the life table death rate or its equivalent measure, log(l,.,/l,), and the
age-standardized cause-specific death
rate for cause i, ASCDR’. In Preston’s
work analyzing the impact of cause-ofdeath structure on age patterns of
mortality, he used these two quantities
together in a multiple regression
model, with log(l,, ,/l,) as the dependent variable. In this analysis, the regression methodology has been modified slightly. Instead of using a multiple
regression model with all the groups of
causes of death serving as independent

variables, I attempted to remove the

effect of multicollinearity among the
causes. Thus, several “diagnostic”

techniques were added before the ap

model. This extra step was necessary to
overcome the problems of multicollinearity whose effect is much greater
when dealing with small sample sizes
such as the case in the present study.

RESULTS

Detailed description of the trend in
causes of death can be found in Bah
(1992a and 1992b), while that of age
patterns of mortality can be found in
Bah and Teklu (1992). The agestandardized crude death rates have
been plotted in Figures 1 and 2 for
males and females, respectively.

From Figure 1, four stages can be
identified from the trend of standardized death rates for males for all causes
combined. The period 1969-74 witnessed slight fluctuations, but close toa
mean level. The period 1975-77 witnessed a rapid rise to a plateau level

A112; A120-A126;
A137-A138

after which the rates returned again to
the pre-1974 level over the period
1980-82. The period 1983-86 saw a
rapid decline to new low levels.

For females, Figure 2 shows a
steadier decline. For the period 197073, the rates were almost constant, followed by a steady decline which was
sustained until 1984 when the lowest
level was reached. There has been a
slow rise in the rates after 1984. Upon
further analysis of the mortality by
causes, Bah (19925) summarizes the
main findings below:

The trend of the age-standardized
cause-specific death rates shows that
changes take place in the magnitude of
the rate as well as in the ranking. A few
of the causes, like diseases of the circulatory system, nutritional disorders,
and digestive system show an increase,
while others, such as infectious diseases, respiratory causes, and “all oth

ers,’’ show a decline. Others, like neoplasms, external causes of injury and
poisoning, and congenital malformations, show little change.

In summary, during the period under study, the changes in rank of various causes can be classed into three
groups. First are those causes which
have hardly changed rank for either
gender. These causes include external
causes of injury, diseases of the digestive system, and diseases due to pregnancy and puerperium. Second are
those causes which changed rank by
one. These causes include respiratory
diseases. Last, there are those causes
which changed by more than one rank.
These causes include neoplasm, for
females, nutritional disorders for females, and “all other causes,” also for

females. Changes in rank for more
than one cause occur more often for
females than for males.

Of the different causes of death, the
ones that show a clear declining trend
for both genders are infectious diseases
and “‘all others.” The causes that show
a clear rising trend for both genders are
diseases of the circulatory system. For

the rest of the causes, there were fluc
tuations of differing magnitudes. The
trends of some causes rise to peaks and
then decline sharply, while for others
the trends were almost constant.
Figure 3 and 4 show the age patterns of mortality for six different
years, namely, 1969, 1973, 1976, 1980,
1983, and 1986. For males, Figure 3
shows a U-shaped curve which gradually changes to a J-shaped curve. The

figure shows changes occurring in ages
below 5 and in ages above 45. For the
ages 5-45, there have not been many
changes. For ages below one, there has
been a uniform decline in the rates,
from 799.4 per 100,000 in 1969 to 122.8
in 1986—a remarkable reduction of
551 per cent. For ages 1-4, there has
been a decline, but a less spectacular
one. For ages above 45, the graph is
marked by cross-overs. There was an
increase in male mortality in 1976 and
a Slight increase in male mortality in
1986.

For females, Figure 4 is also
U-shaped, but becomes less so over
time. Uniform decline in the rates is
observed on the graph for ages below 5
and for ages above 45. There are, how
ever, fewer cross-overs of the curves
in the higher ages than there are for

males. Between ages 60 and 70, the
curves are clustered together and cannot be separated from each other,
which shows the uniformity and the
slow pace of mortality decline in the
higher age groups.

As for the main results of the
present study, Table 2 shows the re- —
gression of an age-specific mortality
measure (log (,p,)) with time. The
ages covered infants and children,
adults and the elderly. For males, only
the infant and child ages (below age 10)
show uniform decline with time. For
adult ages above age 20, the R? was
very low suggesting that the decline in
mortality, if present at all, could not be
linear.

From Table 3, one observes that the
correlations with time for these three
age groups are all significant and lie

above 0.7. The beta value is highest for
age 0-1, followed by age group 1-4
and then age group 5—9. For females,
however, the correlations with time for
all age groups are significant, except
for the older ages above 60. The beta
values for all the age groups below 60
lie above 0.8, being highest for the age
group 20-39. This finding is consistent

with previous findings that over the pe
riod 1969-85, mortality declined uniformly for females for almost all ages,
while for males only the infant and
child ages showed secular decline
(Bah, 1987).

Table 4 shows the regression of standardized cause-specific death rates
with time. The causes that showed a
uniform decline with time were infectious diseases (INF), respiratory diseases (RES), and “others” (OTH) for

both males and females. The causes of
death which showed a uniform rise
with time were disease of the circulatory system (CIR) for both genders
and diseases of the digestive system
(DIG) for males. With the exception of
OTH, the diseases which show a uniform decline are those that respond
easily to intervention efforts. These
have been dubbed “diseases of underdevelopment.” On the other hand,
those causes which show an increase
with time are those that increase along
with development and which have
been dubbed “diseases of development.”

To confirm this finding, correlations
were run among the different causes
as shown in Table 5. For males, the
causes of death showing a high positive
association are: INF and OTH, RES

and OTH, DIG and CIR and to some
extent CIR and NEO. Here one can
see the pairing between diseases belonging to the same group. This relationship is even more significant in the
case of females.”

Because of the high collinearity
among the causes of death, multiple
correlation regression cannot be applied on all the causes together. Some
adjustments need to be made. Several
options are possible. First, the sample
size could be increased, an option not
viable in this case. Second, ridge regression could be applied. Third, factor analysis could be done, followed
by multiple regression. Here, the third
option is used, partly for expediency,
and partly because it does not involve
manipulation of data but rather assists
the researcher in the selection of vari
ables for inclusion in the regression
model.

In the first stage of resolving the
multicollinearity problem, I employed
factor analysis. Oblique rotation of the
Mauritian male data yielded a simple
structure shown in Table 6. The table
shows three factors underlying the
cause-of-death data. The causes of
death loading heavily on the first factor
are NEO and CIR. The first factor reflects causes with a rising trend. The
causes loading heavily on the second
factor are INF, RES and OTH. The
second factor reflects the declining
causes of death. The causes loading
heavily on the third factor are NU,
DIG, CON and INJ. The third factor
reflects the “‘non-directional’”’ causes of
death which show more fluctuation,
rather than showing any clear rising or

declining trend. A similar approach
was utilized with the female data, but
the analysis did not yield any solutions.
However, as was seen earlier, almost
all the causes for females declined with
time.

With the causes of death for males
grouped into these three categories,
the next step is to use this information
in multiple regression analysis. In this
case, the dependent variable is the log
of the life table survivorship values
for adult ages (log(,p,)), and the
independent variables are selected
age-standardized cause-specific death
rates. To avoid the problem of multicollinearity, the causes are selected
such that one comes from each of the
three groups of causes of death identified. Two regression models are thus
constructed. In the first model, the in
dependent variables are CIR, RES,
and INJ. In the second model, the independent variables are NEO, INF,
and INJ. The results for these multiple
regression models are shown in Tables
7 through 10.

From Table 7A we see that the regression model works adequately in
four out of eight age groups; namely,
0-1, 1-5, 5-20, and 40-49. For ages
less than 20, the table shows that declines in RES and INJ are accompanied by an increase in survivorship,
the effect being greater for RES than
for INJ. For CIR, the table shows that
increase in CIR is accompanied by a
decrease in survivorship for ages
greater than 20. Of the three causes—
RES, INJ, and CIR—the cause whose
increase contributed to the greatest
decline in survivorship is CIR.

“See Table 1 for meaning of causes-of-death categories.

Since studies in Mauritian mortality
have shown that male mortality increased during the 1970’s, this information was included in the analysis to see
how it would help to improve the regression modeling. Since the breaking
point for changes in the cause-of-death
structure in Mauritius was found to be
around 1978 (Bah, 19926), the data
were then split into two subsets: pre1978 and post-1978. The results of
the same regression model is shown in
Tables 7B and 7C. Table 7B, for pre1978, shows marked improvement in
R? over that in Table 7A for the adult
ages between 20 and 70. For these
ages, the highest beta values occur for
CIR, and they are all negative. For
these ages, increase in deaths due to
CIR caused marked decline in survivorship. For post-1978, the results of
the regression model is given in Table
7C. Again, as in Table 7B, the marked
improvement in the R? occurred for
adult ages above 20. For these ages,
the cause with the highest beta coefficient is INJ. In the age 70-80 group,
the cause with the highest beta is CIR,
and the R? for the model at this stage is
very high at 0.94.

Bah

Social Biology

From Table 8A it can be seen that
for males, the regression model for
the three other causes—NEO, INF,
and INJ—is adequate for ages less than
20. For these ages, the table shows that
declines in the rates of INF is accompanied by increase in survivorship. The
effects of INJ and NEO are hardly
significant.

As was done above for the first set of
causes, the male data were also split in
two—pre-1978 and post-1978—and the
same regression model (with NEO,
INF, and INJ) was run on both data
sets. The results are shown in Tables
8B and 8C. Table 8B and Table 8C
show marked improvement in R2 over
Table 8A for ages under 20. For these
ages, the result obtained is still the
same, namely, that the greatest effect
on the age pattern was from INF.

In the case of females, it was not
necessary to split the data because
there were no natural breaks in cause
of death structure as was the case for
males. The change in cause of death
structure was smooth over the period
of study. The results of the regression
models using the two different sets of
causes of death are given in Tables 9
and 10.

From these tables, we see that the
causes having the most effect on the
age pattern of mortality for females are
CIR and INF and, to a lesser extent,
RES. The causes INF and RES had
their greatest effect for ages below 20,
while CIR had its greatest effect for
adult ages above 20.

DISCUSSION

The effect of cause structure on age
pattern has not been uniform either in
the intensity or in the type of causes.

The period under study witnessed
changes in both the cause-of-death
structure and the age patterns of mortality.

After studying the pattern of mortality in Mauritius, Bah (1986) ob
served that over the period 1969-85,
there had been a marked change in
age patterns of mortality. The graphs
for the age-specific mortality rates
show a change from U-shape to
J-shape for males, and from U-shape

ages (above 20). However, the crucial
changes in male age patterns of mortality arose as a result of changes in

infant and child mortality about 1978.

These changes came about mostly be
cause of drastic decline in infectious
and parasitic diseases, INF and respiratory diseases, RES. Because of the
rapid decline in these causes of death,
the age pattern of childhood mortality

which was similar to the South Asian
pattern prior to 1978, deviated strongly
from that pattern after 1978.

As young age mortality was under
going changes, old age mortality was

also simultaneously undergoing oppo
site changes. Mortality was experienc
ing a slow-down in decline due to the

rise in CIR. The effect of CIR on the
., adult age pattern of mortality was
=> higher pre-1978 than post-1978. The
Far Eastern pattern of mortality is one
characterized by high old-age mortality
relative to younger ages. This paper
has shown that the cause of death
which contributed the most to making
the Mauritian male age pattern of mortality resemble the Far Eastern pattern
is that of CIR.

For the female population, none of
the Coale and Demeny (1966) or the
New United Nations (1983) families of
model life tables adequately described
the age pattern of mortality. Its mortality pattern was found to be rather
unique. The closest that any of the
model life tables came to being similar
to Mauritian females is the Far Eastern
pattern (Bah and Teklu, 1992). The
findings from this study suggest that it
was the uniform change in the female
S cause-of-death structure that helped to
© maintain this uniqueness in the female

age pattern of mortality.

CONCLUSION

Cause-of-death structure was found
to have influenced age patterns of mortality more in the case of males than
females. For both males and females,
the most prominent causes of death affecting age pattern of mortality were
infectious and parasitic diseases (INF)

and circulatory causes of death (CIR).
Under the period of study, INF
showed a declining trend while CIR
showed a largely rising trend. The
greatest effect of INF on age pattern of
mortality was on the young ages below
20. The rapid decline in INF caused the
male age pattern of mortality in the
young ages to change from one resembling the U.N. South Asian Pattern
prior to 1978 to one different from it
after 1978. For males, the increase in
CIR contributed to relatively high
adult mortality which helped the age
pattern of adult mortality to continue
resembling the U.N. Far Eastern Pattern. For females, the unique age pattern of mortality (different from all
Coale-Demeny or United Nations
model life tables) continued the same
largely because of the very uniform
and smooth change in cause-of-death
structure.

Part of the explanation why Mauritius, with its low mortality, would have
infectious and parasitic diseases as the
most important determinant of age
patterns of mortality has to do with the
transitional phase in Mauritian mortality over the course of the study period.
The early seventies saw Mauritian
mortality undergoing a transition from
the second to the third stages of its
epidemiologic transition. During the
study period, infectious diseases were

_ reduced markedly, losing their first

position to circulatory causes of death,
but nevertheless still remained important causes of death.

There are two major implications
we can identify from this study.

(1)—It increases our understanding of
the age patterns of mortality. The study
of age patterns of mortality is a serious
endeavour in mortality research. Such

228

efforts have resulted in the compilation
of various model life tables such as those
of the United Nations, Coale and Demeny, etc. More specifically, in the case
of Maritius, the study has offered explanations on why the age pattern of mortality resembled certain model life tables and why it differed from such tables
later.

-(2)—Theories of mortality decline
are being formulated without much idea
about the mechanism of the impact of
the cause-of-death structure on age pattern of mortality and subsequently on
mortality trends. For example, one theory of mortality decline argues that mortality decline is not cause-specific, i.e.,
the elimination of certain causes would
not affect the trend in mortality (Turshen, 1989). From this study, we see
how specific causes helped change the

mortality trend and age structure. This
finding would suggest that such theories,
even if found to be valid elsewhere, cannot be generalized for all countries, at
least not in the case of Mauritius. This
finding has direct relevance in the development of techniques for the indirect |
estimation of demographic parameters
and also in shaping health policies.
