Reply to Janowitz’s Comment on “Excess
and Deficit Fertility in the United States”

Desired family size probably is the most
difficult dimension of family size to measure
unambiguously. The response to a question on desired family size tends to reflect
the wording of the question used as well
as any conditions implicitly or explicitly
established by the question or the respondent’s perception of the question. It is
partly for this reason that George (1973)
presents a variety of methods for measuring family size norms that ranges from
KAP survey questions to a Pictorial Choice
Test. Moreover, it has been demonstrated
that family-size desires change over time
in response to economic and social contingencies as well as to family-size experience and fecundity problems (Freedman
et al., 1965). Nevertheless, there often is
a gap between desired family size as measured retrospectively using KAP survey
methodology and size of family, and this
gap tends to vary according to the social,
economic, and fecundity characteristics of
the couple. Ryder and Westoff (1969) have
concluded that there is considerable merit in
a systematic appraisal of the relationship
between size of the completed family and
retrospectively determined desire.

Dr. Janowitz’s efforts to clarify the
meaningfulness of the deficit fertility cate

gory are quite welcome. I certainly would
not quarrel with her assertion that couples
tend to adjust their reproductive goals according to their social and economic circumstances and according to perceived
future circumstances. Her apparent objection to the existence of voluntary deficit
fertility is based upon the premise that if
these women really want the number of
children they desire, they would have them.
This seems analogous to asserting that
there is no excess fertility because if
women really did not want x number of children they would not have had them. However, Dr. Janowitz is undoubtedly correct
when she concludes that these women who
are voluntarily in the deficit fertility category are having the number of children
they believe are appropriate given their
social, economic, and family circumstances.
This consideration is one that makes the existence of voluntarily determined deficit
fertility so tantalizing, because it is not
known to what extent these women would
attempt to reduce their deficit gap if their
situations were to be altered, i.e., to what
extent these women would revise their birth
expectations upward. This subject would
be an extremely suitable one for additional
exploration.
