ABSTRACT: Marriage in Indian society is a religious duty. Consanguineous marriage is common,
where individuals prefer to marry within their clan (a unilateral kin group based on either matrilineal or patrilineal descent). Keeping in mind that this form of marriage has certain disadvantages for social and biological as well as demographic aspects of individuals and families, the
present study examines the influence of mate selection (i.e., close relatives, distant relatives, not
related) on female age at marriage, pregnancy wastages, and survival status of the first child.
The study was designed based on the information collected on a sample size of 3,948 married
women aged 13-49 in Tamil Nadu, India, by the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), 1992.
Results suggest that 48 per cent of women in Tamil Nadu marry their relatives. This practice of
marrying relatives is high in rural areas, among Hindus, Scheduled Castes/tribes, and illiterate
women as compared to urban areas, among non-Hindus, non-SC/ST, and educated women, respectively. The bivariate analysis reveals that women marrying their close relatives had low age
at marriage and experienced a higher per cent of pregnancy wastage and child loss (first child)
as compared to those women marrying their distant relatives or nonrelatives. The result is found
to be consistent even after controlling for selected background variables through multivariate
techniques (applied separately for age at marriage, pregnancy wastages, and the survival status
of first child). Hence, this study suggests that steps should be taken to inform people about the
problems of marrying close relatives through appropriate [EC programs in Tamil Nadu.

common male ancestor up to the seventh generation on the father’s side and
the fifth generation on mother’s side.

According to the recent NFHS estimates (1992-93), the practice of marrying
relatives is highest in Tamil Nadu (48.2 per
cent) followed by Karnataka (37.2 per
cent), Andhra Pradesh (36.5 per cent) and
Maharashtra (28.3 per cent). The incidence
of marriage between relatives is less than
10 per cent in all other states except for the
Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir
(16.5 per cent), Goa (15.2 per cent),
Arunachal Pradesh (13.8 per cent), and
Kerala (11.0 per cent). Previous studies
have also observed considerably higher
levels of consanguinity in south India than
in north India (Kapadia, 1958; Roychoudhury, 1976; Bittles et al., 1991). According
to Bittles et al. (1991), on the average,
20-45 per cent of marriages in the primarily Hindu states of south India are contracted between close relatives, with uncleniece and cross-first-cousin unions, usually
mother’s brother’s daughter, especially
popular. Studies by Sanghvi (1982) and
Govinda Reddy (1987) observed in the
rural areas of Andhra Pradesh that around
45 per cent of all marriages were consanguineous. In the south the consanguinity
prohibition is relaxed to conform to the
prevailing custom of great preference for
consanguineous marriage which originated
at the time of entry of the Brahman influence in the first millenntum (Sanghvi,
1982). This custom is an important way in
which the south differs from the north as
mentioned by B. C. Baudhayana (one of
the earliest law givers) in his Dharmasutra
(Sastri, 1955).

Earlier studies on mate selection in India and in other countries highlight the
need for examining this issue, especially in
demographic research. Some of these stud

ies are grouped under different headings
and are given below:

REASONS FOR MARRYING RELATIVES

There could be various reasons for the
people of south India to prefer marriage
between relatives. According to Dronamraju (1964) the main reasons are:

(1) to keep the cultivable land in larger subdivisions for growing food crops such
as rice,

(2) parental influence,

(3) the extreme youth of the brides,

(4) mutual knowledge of families concerned and

(5) economic benefits, since the parents
and grandparents of the consanguineous
spouses and their descendants can all
live together in joint families, pooling
their resources and sharing all expenditures.

Few studies have also highlighted that
consanguineous marriages are preferred
since they offer the optimum opportunity
for compatibility, both between husband
and wife and between the bride and her
mother-in-law (Dronamraju and Meera
Khan, 1963; Khlat et al., 1986; Reddy
and Usha Rani, 1996).

However, Caldwell et al. (1983) observed that in south India the practice of
marrying relatives is becoming less common, which they attributed to three reasons.

(1) The most common reason is an increased dowry if the boy’s parents seek a
marriage outside the family, because the
tradition persists that the cost of marriage between relatives must be small.

(2) In a heterogeneous society (in terms of
education and wealth), it is becoming
more difficult to arrange an appropriate match within relatives, and hence it
is necessary to search through a larger
population.

(3) The third reason is a growing belief
that such marriages might produce
sickly children, an idea which is clearly

a cultural import (probably affected
both by north Indian and Western attitudes).

INFLUENCE OF MATE SELECTION ON
FEMALE MARRIAGE AGE

Scholars are of the opinion that when
marriage takes place between relatives the
age at marriage of both males and females
can be expected to be at younger ages
since no searching and waiting for suitable
mates is involved (Caldwell et al., 1983;
Richard, 1988; Audinarayana, 1990; and
Sureender, 1993). According to Kapadia
(1958), “it very often happens that a bridegroom is not available within a small endogamous group. People cannot shed their
endogamous habits and so they look for a
partner for their daughter in the neighborhood. Time thus passes in the search for a
bridegroom, and imperceptibly and unwillingly the girl grows up. This ts the situation prevailing in the Hindu community
today and it is bound to worsen.” Sureender (1993) observed in rural areas of
Pondicherry that the ages at marriage of
both brides and bridegrooms of consanguineous marriages are lower than in nonconsanguineous marriages. According to
the author, “people very much hesitate to
go for unrelated matches since the practices and the normal way of living of those
people may differ from their own, which
may create the problem of adjustment between the bride/bridegroom and in-laws.”
Based on the above studies, we hypothesize that women marrying relatives would
have a lower age at marriage compared to
women marrying nonrelatives.

fluence on fetal wastages. The scientific
committee on the effects of atomic radiation set up by the United Nations (1962)
critically examined studies in the United
States, France, and Japan and found that
rates of morbidity and mortality increased
in the offspring of consanguineous marriages as compared to those of unrelated
individuals. However, the studies are of
very unequal scope and reliability for a
quantitative analysis. However, there is
convincing evidence linking inbreeding to
increased rates of spontaneous abortion/
miscarriage (Neel and Schull, 1962;
Schull et al., 1970; Al-Awadi et al., 1986).
Boue and Boue (1973) observed that many
early spontaneous abortions (those which
are related to gametic compatibility) could
be a result of genic and chromosomal
anomalies. They also noted that this type
of incompatibility seems related to the genetic homogeneity of couples. However,
Reid (1976) in rural Sri Lanka observed
that consanguinity of the couples was not
found to affect significantly rates of spontaneous abortions, still-births, or deaths of
later offsprings. On the other hand, a few
studies have indicated that the incidence of
congenital malformations is significantly
higher in consanguineous progeny (FreireMaia et al., 1983; Jaber et al., 1992). From
a biological viewpoint, the sharing of common “human leukocyte antigens” (genetic
markers found on the surface of most nucleated cells of the body) by spouses, more
probable in consanguineous marriages, has
been claimed to be a contributory factor in
difficulties initiating pregnancies and/or a
history of recurrent spontaneous abortion
(Bittles, 1994). Hence, the hypothesis
tested in this study is that women marrying relatives would experience more pregnancy wastage than those marrying unrelated men.

INFLUENCE OF MATE SELECTION ON
SURVIVAL STATUS OF THE FIRST CHILD

Researchers generally argue that the
survival status of the child also depends on
the mate selection. Schull and his associates (1965) account for the elevated fertility of consanguineous couples in Japan as
compensation for the higher mortality rates
of their inbred offspring. There is also a
general belief among the south Indians that
marriages between relatives may produce
unhealthy children (Caldwell et al., 1983).
A study from south India, where a high
proportion of childhood mortality was
specifically diagnosed as genetic in origin
(Radha Rama Devi et al., 1987), provides
strong support for the hypothesis that deleterious recessive genes significantly determine childhood morbidity and mortality in
communities with a high prevalence of
consanguineous unions. Govinda Reddy
(1987), while analyzing the effects of consanguineous marriages on fertility (among
members of wealthier castes) in Andhra
Pradesh, observed a higher child mortality
among the offspring of consanguineous
unions than among their counterparts. In a
study carried out in Pakistan, infant mortality in each of the consanguineous classes
was 12.7 per cent for double first cousins,
7.9 per cent for first cousins, 9.2 per cent
for first cousins once removed/double second cousins, 6.9 per cent for second
cousins, and 5.1 per cent among nonconsanguineous progeny (Bittles et al., 1993).
Recently a positive association between
consanguinity and mortality was noted by
Bittles (1994) with excess deaths observed
in the offspring of all consanguineous
classes at all ages at death, even after controlling for nongenetic factors. Bittles and
Neel (1994) observed in a predominantly

Sureender et al.

 

Social Biology

Hindu population of both rural and urban
areas of Tamil Nadu that the percentage of
mortality in first cousin offspring is higher
than that of nonconsanguineous offspring.
For instance, the authors noted that in rural
areas of Tamil Nadu, 28.3 per cent of first
cousin offspring die compared to 26.3
per cent of nonconsanguineous offspring.
Hence, we hypothesize in this study that
the survival status of the first child would
be less for women marrying relatives compared to those marrying nonrelatives. The
rationale of selecting the first order birth is
that mate selection might have an immediate and strong effect on the first child rather
than on subsequent births.

Overall, earlier studies have highlighted
that marriage between relatives has certain
disadvantages on social and biological, as
well as demographic, aspects of individuals and family. However, the situation may
turn out to be very different if recent information is analyzed. Hence, this particular
issue has been considered for investigation
in this paper. Since Tamil Nadu has a
higher percentage of women marrying relatives than other states of India, this state
is considered for the analysis. An attempt
is made here to highlight the influence of
mate selection on female marriage age,
pregnancy wastage, and survival status of
the first child among the women who were
married only once by the time of survey.
Although the practice of marrying relatives could result in malformations among
babies and influence their intellectual capacity, these variables are not considered
in this study due to nonavailability of data.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The National Family Health Survey
(NFHS) which gathered information on a

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

Vol. 45, No. 3-4

representative sample of 3,948 ever married women age 13-49 in Tamil Nadu, India, during 1992 is used for the purpose of
this study.

Variable mate selection has been classified into three categories: close relatives,
distant relatives, and not related. The category “close relatives” includes only persons marrying their first cousin, or second
cousin, or uncle; those marrying other
blood relations, or brother-in-law, or other
nonblood relation are grouped in the category of “distant relatives.’ Those who
marry outside their blood relations or outside their relatives are classified as those
not related before marriage. The classification of close, distant, and not related reflects the biological or genetic influence of
these variables. However, as the level of
homozygosity is expected to vary between
these three groups, care has been taken not
to interpret the differences that would exist
among them in precise biological terms.

For this paper, variable pregnancy
wastage includes those women who had
experienced spontaneous abortion or stillbirths in their reproductive life (coded as
l-experienced, Q-not experienced). The
variable survival status of first child is
measured as 1-surviving and 2-not surviving at the time of survey, for women who
had given birth to at least one child.

Obviously, there are many factors in
addition to mate selection that could affect
age at marriage, pregnancy wastage, and
survival status of the first child. Hence,
based on the available literature (Caldwell
et al., 1983; Audinarayana, 1990; Sureender, 1992; Shyamala, 1993), a few background variables were selected. These
variables are: childhood place of residence
(coded as l-urban, 2-rural), religion
(coded as Hindus, Muslims, and others),

Mate Selection

 

293

caste (coded as 0-sc/st, 1-others), age of
women (continuous), female age at marriage (coded, while studying pregnancy
wastage and survival status of the first
child as women marrying below 18 years,
marrying between 18-19 years, and marrying above 19 years), education of
women (coded as illiterate and educated
up to primary, middle, high school, and
above), exposure to mass media (coded as
those not exposed to any medium, exposed
at least to one medium, two media, three
media), knowledge about legal age at marriage for females (coded as 1-correct and
0-incorrect), age at menarche (coded as
those below 13 years, between 13-14
years, and above 14 years), age of mother
at first birth (continuous), and status of
drinking water (coded as 0-unsafe, 1-safe).

To study the influence of mate selection on female age at marriage, we use
multiple regression technique. We use logistic regression to examine the influence
of mate selection on pregnancy wastage
and survival status of first child, since the
dependent variable (pregnancy wastage
and survival status of first child) is of
more than one category.

CHARACTERISTICS OF
EVER-MARRIED WOMEN

Table 1 presents descriptive information on the sample of ever-married
women. Nearly half of the women are under age 30. The percentage in each group
increases up to age 25-29, reflecting the
increase in the proportion married in successive age groups. The percentage declines after age 25-29, by which time
most women have already married, reflecting the normal pyramidal shape of
the age distribution (NFHS, 1992). The
majority of women (70.2 per cent) stay in

rural areas and are Hindus (88 per cent);
19 per cent belong to Scheduled Castes/
Scheduled Tribes, and 81 per cent are
from other caste groups. Half of the respondents are illiterate, and only 15 per
cent have completed at least high school.
In terms of their exposure to mass media,
less than one-fourth have not been exposed to any medium. Nearly two-thirds
are unaware of the legal female age at
marriage which clearly reveals the weak
enforcement of legislation on age at marriage. While only 15 per cent experienced
their first monthly period before the age
of 13, the corresponding percentages between the ages of 13-14 and above 14
years are 45 per cent and 40 per cent respectively. In the case of age at marriage,
52 per cent married before the age of 18,
while 23.6 per cent and 24.4 per cent
married between the ages of 18-19 and
above 19 years, respectively. The mean
age at marriage for females in Tamil
Nadu is found to be 17.6 years. Around
21 per cent of women experienced pregnancy wastage at least once in their reproductive life, and 13 per cent of women
lost their first child.

In the case of mate selection, 38.3 per
cent of women in Tamil Nadu marry their
close relatives; 9.9 per cent, their distant

relatives; and 51.7 per cent marry nonrelatives. Earlier studies by Rao et al.,
(1972, 1977) reveal that the frequency of
consanguineous marriages in the rural
and urban areas of Tamil Nadu were
around 50 per cent and 30 per cent of all
marriages, respectively. Further, according to the authors, the practice of marrying within relatives did not reveal any
significant decline over the decades.

RESULTS

Table 2 provides information on mate
selection for the rural and urban areas of
Tamil Nadu by selected background characteristics. As compared to urban areas,
the practice of marriage between relatives
is high in rural areas. This finding could
partly be attributed to changing cultural
norms and practices in the urban areas
due to increasing social awareness. This
practice does not vary much by age in either rural or urban areas, indicating that
there has not been significant change in
mate selection over time. However, as
compared to those women in the age
group 45-49, slightly more women in the
other age groups marry nonrelatives (except in the age group < = 19) both in
rural and urban areas of Tamil Nadu.

An examination of mate selection by
education of women reveals that educated
women in both rural and urban areas are
more likely to marry nonrelatives than
are illiterate women. For instance, in urban areas, 68.5 per cent of women educated up to high school and above marry
nonrelatives as compared to 55.3 per cent
among illiterate women. This finding
clearly reveals the influence of education
on the mate selection procedure.

The table further shows that women of
the Hindu religion are more likely to
marry relatives than women belonging to
other religions. This finding is the same
both in rural and urban areas of Tamil

 

 

Nadu which reflects the fact that this cultural practice is more strongly followed
by Hindus than by Muslims or Christians.
Further, in the Muslim community, uncle-niece marriages are not at all preferred which could also have contributed
to the difference between Hindus and
Muslims in the percentage of women
marrying unrelated men.

The caste picture reveals that the percentage of Scheduled Caste/Tribe women
marrying their relatives is comparatively
higher than for other caste women in both
rural and urban areas. However, this finding is not consistent with earlier studies.
According to Govinda Reddy (1987), in
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

Vol. 45, No. 3-4

Andhra Pradesh higher caste women
marry relatives more often than do
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
He explains, “higher castes follow this
practice to avoid splitting their movable
and immovable properties through dowry
and bride price.” This inconsistency in
the finding could be partly attributed to
the broad grouping of the variable “caste”
as “SC/ST” and “others” in this study.
Since the category “others” includes both
forward and backward caste populations,
it is possible that the real influence of the
variable “caste” is not captured. However, because of the problems related to
the grouping of different castes as forward and backward, this exercise is not
carried out in this study.

Table 3 provides information on average female age at marriage by mate selection. It indicates that the average female
age at marriage for those marrying their
close relatives is 16.90 years as compared
to 17.60 years and 18.27 years for those
marrying their distant relatives and those
marrying unrelated men, respectively.

This finding clearly indicates that there
is a relationship between mate selection
and female age at marriage, supported by
a significant one-way analysis of variance
between these groups. However, to
strengthen this relationship, a few background variables have been controlled by
the regression analysis. The independent
variables that have been considered for
the analysis apart from the variable mate
selection are: current age of women, religion, caste, childhood place of residence,
female education, age at menarche, exposure to mass media, and knowledge about
female legal age at marriage. These explanatory variables are regressed with the
female age at marriage, and the results
given in Table 5. The results of regression

analysis reveal that those women marrying close relatives or distant relatives have
a significantly lower age at marriage is
compared to the reference category, i.e.,
not related, even after controlling for the
rest of the background variables.

Among the rest of the explanatory variables, religion, caste, age at menarche, education of women, and childhood place of
residence were found to significantly influence the female age at marriage. Nonscheduled caste women, those residing in
urban areas, those with higher age at
menarche, and those with better educational attainment were found to have a
higher age at marriage as compared to
scheduled caste/tribe women, women residing in rural areas, women with low mean
age at menarche, and illiterate women, respectively.

Table 4 reveals the relationship between
mate selection and the experience of pregnancy wastage. Women marrying their
close relatives were found to experience
higher pregnancy wastage (22.7 per cent)
as compared to those marrying their distant
relatives (21.6 per cent) and those marrying nonrelatives (18.7 per cent). To
strengthen the relationship, background
variables like age of women, childhood
place of residence, religion, caste, education of women, female age at marriage,
and age of mother at first birth are considered along with the variable mate selection.

Taking the background variables and pregnancy wastages as the dependent variables,
we used logistic regression analysis, the results of which are given in Table 5.

Table 5 shows that the odds of pregnancy wastage was 1.3 times higher
among those women who married close
relatives as compared to those marrying
nonrelatives. To an extent, this finding indicates that there is a significant relationship between mate selection and pregnancy wastages even after controlling for
the influence of other background variables. Although those women marrying
distant relatives also experienced higher
pregnancy wastages than those marrying
nonrelatives, the existing difference appears to be statistically insignificant.

In the case of the other explanatory
variables, age of women, age at marriage,
and mother’s age at first birth significantly influence the chance of experiencing pregnancy wastage. Older women,
those marrying early, and those having
their first child at a later age experienced
more pregnancy wastage compared to
younger women, those marrying late,
those having their first child at a younger
age, respectively. The positive influence
of women’s age at first birth on pregnancy wastage clearly indicates the problems associated with late pregnancy.

Social Biology

The relationship between mate selection and the survival status of the first
child is given in Table 6. It reveals that
16.8 per cent of women marrying close
relatives lost their first child as compared
to 15 per cent and 11.5 per cent of
women marrying distant relatives and
women marrying unrelated men, respectively. The chi-square value also indicates
a significant relation between these two
variables.

At the second step, background variables like age of women, religion, caste,
childhood place of residence, mother’s
age at first birth, female age at marriage,
education of women, and the status of
drinking water are considered along with
the variable mate selection and related to
the survival status of the first child. Logistic regression analysis is used for this
purpose and the results are given in Table
5. This table reveals that even after controlling for the selected background variables women marrying close relatives
lost their first child significantly more often than did women marrying nonrelatives, i.e., 1.3 times more often than the
reference category women. Although the
percentage of women who lost their first
child is high for those marrying distant
relatives as compared to the reference
group (i.e., not related), the difference is
Statistically insignificant. In addition to
the variable mate selection, age of
women, mother’s age at first birth, educational level, and caste of women also play
a significant role in influencing the survival status of the first-born child.

mainly to avoid sharing of property outside
the family. Further, a general view is that
parents marry off their daughters to a
known family so that if there is any problem in the future, it could be easily solved.
In these kind of marriages, the age of the
girls is given least importance. This practice of marrying relatives is high in rural
areas, among Hindus, Scheduled Castes/
tribes, and illiterate women as compared to
urban areas, non-Hindus, non-SC/ST, and
educated women, respectively.

The second analysis examines the influence of mate selection on female age at
marriage, using the multiple regression
technique. The results reveal that even after controlling for selected background
variables, women marrying their relatives
have a low age at marriage compared to
their counterparts. It is possible that in
nonconsanguineous marriage, the searching process takes a long time, and hence
the female marriage age is high as compared to that of women marrying relatives.

nancy wastage and the survival status of
the first child, respectively, by applying
the logistic regression technique. The results show that those women marrying
close relatives experience more pregnancy wastage and child loss (first child)
compared to those marrying distant relatives and those marrying nonrelatives. To
some extent this finding indicates the
problem in marrying close relatives and
suggests that adequate attention should
be paid to the issue of mate selection in
demographic analyses.

Especially now when the state of Tamil
Nadu is nearing the replacement level of
fertility, the major areas which require attention by state government are (1) to reduce infant mortality and pregnancy
wastages, and (2) to further increase female age at marriage. To achieve these
goals requires curtailing the practice of
marrying relatives. Although the Hindu
Marriage Act of 1955 prohibits uncleniece marriages, it has been largely ignored as is shown by the significant proportion of consanguineous marriages still
taking place in Tamil Nadu. Since people
may outweigh any biological disadvantages for the socioeconomic advantages of
consanguineous unions, what we require
more than legislation is a vigorous mass
campaign to tackle this issue. The available Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) programs should try to
highlight the problems related to these
types of marriages along with their other
campaigns relating to health and welfare.
