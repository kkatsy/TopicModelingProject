ABSTRACT: The purpose of this analysis was to determine if there were differences in selected
fertility characteristics including parity, pregnancy spacing, age at first pregnancy, age of menarche, breastfeeding postpartum, and contraceptive practices among white, black, Hmong,
and other Southeast Asian mothers attending a maternal infant care program in Minneapolis,
Minnesota, during 1980-82.

White and black mothers were younger than the Hmong and other Asian mothers. The lowest mean age of first pregnancy was among blacks. Ages of first pregnancy were similar for
whites, Hmong, and other Asians, although the mean age of menarche was approximately two
years later for Hmong and other Southeast Asian mothers compared to the white and black

mothers.

Based on self reports at the first postpartum visit one month after delivery, 39 per cent of the
whites and 25 per cent of the blacks were breastfeeding. In comparison 8.7 per cent of the
Hmong and 17 per cent of the other southeast Asian mothers were breastfeeding.

Maternal age and age at first pregnancy were significant predictors of parity for whites,
blacks, Hmong, and the other Southeast Asians. Ever-use of contraception was a significant

predictor of parity only for Hmong.

The highest proportion of ever-users of contraception was among the white mothers (80 per
cent) followed by the blacks (69.3 per cent) and other Asian mothers (34.8 per cent). Hmong
mothers had the lowest proportion having used contraception (17.1 per cent).

Documentation about the fertility
and contraceptive practices of Southeast
Asian refugees in the United States has
been limited, although their young age
distribution has implications for maternal health and family planning program.
Mean ages of Southeast Asian refugees
entering the United States between
1975-81 varied between 20-21 years;
37-40 per cent are less than 15 years old

(Marsh, 1980). Total fertility rates in.

Southeast Asia range between 5.3 and
6.5. Crude birth rates among Southeast
Asian women in the U.S. were 28 in
1980 compared to 15/1,000 for all U.S.
women; mean parities ranged between

2.2 for Vietnamese and 3.1 for Laotians
(Gordon, 1982).

Family size has been predicted by
mother’s desired family size, age of the
woman at first childbirth, and age of the
woman at marriage (Bumpass et al.,
1978; Linn, 1976; Rindfuss and Bumpass, 1978; Trussel and Menkin, 1978;
Zimmer, 1979). Coombs (1979) found
that two-thirds of women in Taiwan,
Korea, the Philippines, and Malaysia
with a preference for smaller families
used the birth control pill and IUD as
contraceptives, whereas only one-half
of the women she studied, who had preferences for a larger family, used these

methods. Johnson and Stokes (1976)
have found that if individuals are
satisfied with existing norms and roles,
their fertility pattern will mimic that of
their family of origin.

There is limited data that systematically represent Southeast Asians in the
United States and also provide sufficient
information about ethnicity, fertility,
and contraceptive use. Consequently,
research has had to utilize specific clinic
data or rely on more generalizable data
with limited variables to measure fertility and contraceptive practices. Most
previous research has focused on refugees entering the United States during
the mid-1970’s who were predominantly
urban and more educated than the second wave of refugees entering the
United States in the late 1970’s. The
purpose of this analysis is to assess differences in parity, pregnancy spacing,
age at first pregnancy, age of menarche,
breastfeeding, and contraceptive practices among white, black, Hmong, and
other Southeast Asian mothers attending a maternal infant care program in
Minneapolis, Minnesota during 198082.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data base consists of the service
Statistics from the Minneapolis Health
Department Maternal Infant Care Program. Interpreters were available to ask
questions and translate responses. Between 1980-82 a total of 594 white, 192
black, 356 Hmong, and 112 other Southeast Asian (Cambodians, Laotians,
Vietnamese) mothers delivered in the
Maternity and Infant Care Program.
While Minnesota has about 3 per cent of
the total Southeast Asian refugees that
have come to the United States up to
1982 (Office of Refugee Resettlement,

Social Biology

1982), 80 per cent of these refugees have
settled in Hennepin and Ramsey counties with the majority residing in Minneapolis and St. Paul. The refugees in this
study population entered the United
States in 1979.

Southeast Asian women receiving
care at the Minneapolis Health Department had less than 5 years of education
compared to an average of 11 years for
whites and blacks. Income per individual in Southeast Asian families was less
than for whites and blacks, although 97
per cent of the Hmong and 88 per cent of
other Southeast Asian mothers were
married compared to 35 per cent of the
whites and 25 per cent of the blacks.
Southeast Asian mothers were older
(25-26 years) and of higher parity (3-4)
than whites and blacks. On the average,
white and black mothers were 22-23
years old and had one living child.

Five per cent of the Hmong and 10
per cent of the other Southeast Asian
mothers spoke some English when admitted to the program. The other Southeast Asians include three distinct ethnic
groups, Cambodians, Laotians, and
Vietnamese, while the Hmong represent one distinct ethnic group, a nomadic hill tribe that had resided primarily in Laos (Swenson et al., 1985).

RESULTS

Age at first pregnancy was similar for
whites, Hmong, and other Asians although the mean age of menarche was
approximately two years later for
Hmong and other Southeast Asian
mothers compared to the white and
black mothers (Table 1). The outcome
of the first pregnancy comprising the
most recent intervals was a nonlive birth
for 8.6 per cent of the Asians, compared
to 26.5 per cent of the whites and 22.2

tion, parity was positively related to ma

lated to age at first pregnancy (p<0.01).

Parity was higher among ever-users than

never-users of contraception although

the differences were borderline signi
ficant (Table 3). To evaluate parity fur
ther, separate regressions were run for

each race group. Maternal age and age

at first pregnancy were significant pre,, dictors of parity for whites, blacks,

An exploratory regression analysis of
age at first pregnancy explaining 45 per
cent of the variance suggested that
blacks and Hmong had significantly
younger ages of first pregnancy than the
dther Southeast Asians (Table 4). Although ages of first pregnancy were
lower for whites than for the other
Southeast Asians, the differences were
not significant. There was a significant
positive relationship between age at first
pregnancy and maternal age and a borderline positive relationship between
age of first pregnancy and age of menarche. Age at first pregnancy was lower
among ever-users of contraception compared to mothers who had previously
used contraception, although the differences were of borderline significance.

Contraceptive Practices 51

The significant positive relationship
between age at first pregnancy and maternal age was apparent in all racial
groups. Age at menarche was of borderline significance for whites and blacks
but not significant for Hmong and other
Asians. Among whites, blacks, and
Hmong, ever-users of contraception
had younger ages of first pregnancy although these differences were not significant. However, other Southeast
Asians who had used contraception had
later ages of first pregnancy than those
who had never used contraception. Less
of the variance in age at first pregnancy
among blacks (30 per cent) than for
whites, Hmong, and other Southeast
Asians (43-46 per cent) was explained
by the variables in the regression model.

The highest proportion of ever-users
of contraception was among the white
mothers (80 per cent). Hmong mothers
had the lowest proportion having used
contraception (17.1 per cent). Oral contraceptives were the most commonly
used method among white, black, and
other Southeast Asians. Comparable
proportions of Hmong used oral contraceptives and barrier methods (Table 5).

Among the ever-users, comparable
proportions of whites (21.1 per cent),
blacks (19.6 per cent) and Hmong (19.7
per cent) indicated they had been using
contraception at the time of conception
while 10.3 per cent of the other Asian
mothers stated that they were using contraception when they conceived. This
variable cannot truly reflect contraceptive failure since the women were not
specifically asked if the pregnancy was
planned, desired, etc. However, it suggests that Southeast Asians seem to be
slightly more successful users of contraception than whites, blacks, and
Hmong.

for whites.

Among the previous users, white and
Hmong mothers most frequently chose
barrier methods: diaphragms, foam/
jelly or cream. Black and other Asian
mothers most often chose oral contraceptives. Among never-users, white and
black mothers most often chose oral
contraceptives, while Hmong and other
Southeast Asian mothers most often
chose barrier methods.

DISCUSSION

Concurrent with their higher parities
and closer pregnancy spacing, the majority of Southeast Asian women had
not used contraception in the past. Contrary to expected findings, the Southeast
Asian women were less likely to breastfeed than black and Caucasian women.
Although breastfeeding may have been
more prevalent among the Southeast
Asians prior to their entry into the
United States, it may be more conven

to the Hmong. Some clinic staff suggest
that the Southeast Asian mothers may
both breast- and bottle-feed although
they report bottle-feeding, thus producing some underreporting of breastfeeding among the Southeast Asians. The
‘short intervals observed among the
Southeast Asians, particularly the
Hmong, may reflect their lack of breastfeeding coupled with their limited use of
modern contraceptives.
= The interpregnancy intervals are in
“most cases closed intervals where the
ofirst pregnancy comprising the interval
goccurred before the mothers’ entry into
the MIC program. The first pregnancy
cof the intervals for most of the Asian
—mothers occurred before the mothers’
~immigration to the United States. The
larger proportions of nonlive births as
“first pregnancies of intervals for whites
sand blacks compared to the Asians may
Sdistort comparisons of pregnancy spacaing between the race groups.
‘6 Estimates of spontaneous and inluced abortions may be biased by less
Scomplete reporting of fetal deaths by the
‘sAsians compared to the whites and
blacks. Higher reporting of induced
abortions among the other Southeast
“pAsians compared to the Hmong may
‘Sreflect their greater efforts to control
efertility. This interpretation is supported
Aby the higher reported frequencies of
ever-use of contraception among other
Southeast Asians compared to Hmong,
more effective use of contraception,
preferences for oral contraceptives and
IUD’s, and the proportion of other
southeast Asian mothers selecting tubal
ligation. These findings may be related
to the fact that the other Southeast
Asian mothers were also slightly older
and of higher parity on the average than
white and black mothers. In addition,
the other Southeast Asians had more

education than Hmong and potentially
were more inclined to limit childbearing
to increase opportunities for upward social mobility.

The increase in use of contraception
postpartum compared to prior to entry
into the MIC program suggests acceptance when methods are available. Conclusions about contraceptive methods
may be biased by several conditions.
First, contraceptive use after delivery
may be a temporary method which the
women may change at a later time. Secondly, the differences in proportions returning for postpartum visits vary between race groups by previous use of
contraception.

The older ages of first pregnancy reported by the Hmong and other Southeast Asians may be due to the years of
war and disruption. Therefore, age of
first childbearing among the Southeast
Asian refugees requires further examination in future research particularly
when considering the lack of any significant impact of age of menarche on age
of first pregnancy for Hmong and other
Asian mothers. Validity of data on age
of menarche may be more questionable
for the Asian than for the white and
black mothers. However, the differences in the mean ages of menarche may
reflect the differences in nutritional status between the groups prior to menarche.
