ABSTRACT: A secondary analysis of public-health survey data collected from 298 women, age
40 or older, delivering a live-born child in Michigan distinguished four respondent groups: those
exposed to medical advice about amniocentesis and their decision about the procedure
(Medically-informed Tested vs. Medically-informed Untested) and those unexposed to medical
advice who reported being either aware or unaware of the procedure (Medically-uninformed
Aware vs. Medically-uninformed Unaware). The two medically-informed groups differed in
their estimates of risk for Down syndrome (DS), risk of test injury to the fetus, and aversion to
the risk of birth defects. A regression analysis determined that perceived risk for DS due to
maternal age best distinguished between the two groups. The tested women differed from the
other three groups on several sociodemographic variables. The discussion draws from the
Health Belief Model to identify strategies for creating a risk awareness in the target population.

sis in which patients confront their views
on abortion and weigh these against the
anticipated burden of rearing an abnormal child (Antley, 1976; Beeson and
Golbus, 1985; Chervin et al., 1977; Davies and Doran, 1982; Dixson et al.,
1981; Finley et al., 1977; Fletcher, 1981;
Kolker and Burke, 1987; Rothman,
1986; Seals et al., 1985).

This study presents a significant departure from previous studies which
base their findings on a limited population, namely those patients seeking or
referred for genetic counseling. Concentrating on the general population of
women with advanced maternal age,
this investigation seeks to assess the
forty-year-old woman’s knowledge of
her risk for DS, her awareness of a procedure for detecting birth defects, the
medical information she did or did not
receive about the procedure, and the
factors she considered in making a decision about the procedure.

This secondary analysis of data selected from a public health department
survey compares four groups of women,
distinguished by their reported knowledge of and their decision about amniocentesis. The first analysis compares the
two medically-informed groups that differed in their decisions about having the
procedure (i.e., Medically-informed
Tested vs. Medically-informed Untested). This comparison, which focuses
on the mothers’ knowledge of their risk
for DS and the risks of the procedure,
concludes with a regression analysis that
identifies the salient predictors of their
decision. The two medically-informed
groups are then compared to two groups
of women who received no medical advice about the procedure and reported
they were either aware or unaware of
the test (i.e., Medically-uninformed
Aware vs. Medically-uninformed Un

aware). These two groups also did not
have the procedure. This analysis highlights the sociodemographic characteristics of the four groups and further examines the women’s knowledge of risks.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A secondary analysis was conducted
of data collected in 1981 by the Michigan
Department of Public Health (MDPH)
in a survey of women, age 40 or older,
who delivered a live-born child in Michigan during the 1980 calendar year. Birth
certificate records supplied names and
addresses of these women. Excluded
from the survey for reasons of sensitivity
were women undergoing spontaneous
abortion, women who delivered stillborns, and those releasing the child for
abortion. With these exclusions, the
birth certificate data yielded a list of 647
women, from a total of 701, with complete address information.

Each woman received a mailed
packet containing a questionnaire and a
cover letter explaining the study with
the guarantee of subject anonymity. All
materials were written at an eight-grade
reading level. After one follow-up, 302
women had returned questionnaires, a
response rate of 47 per cent. Four questionnaires were excluded due to respondent error, leaving 298 respondents
available for this secondary analysis.

Table 1 presents a comparison of the
birth certificate and respondent data on
educational attainment, race, and number of previous live-born children. Respondents were more likely to be white,
better educated, and to have smaller
families than nonrespondents. Previous
studies suggest that these same characteristics typically distinguish between
women seeking or receiving genetic
counseling, and in some cases, any pre

Statistical analyses included logistic
and multiple regression, chi-square, and
multiple comparison (Scheffe) tests. Alpha was set at the 0.05 level for detecting
significant effects.

RESULTS
RESPONDENT CLASSIFICATIONS

The respondents were classified by
their answers to whether their physician
or the physician’s nurse had provided
them information about amniocentesis
and were divided into the two groups
“Informed” or “Uninformed.” The Informed group was subsequently divided
into those having amniocentesis
(Informed-tested, n = 105) and those
not having amniocentesis (Informeduntested, n = 143) during the first five

months of the index pregnancy. The
Uninformed respondents were divided
into those reporting having knowledge
of the procedure (Uninformed-aware,
n = 23) or no knowledge of the procedure (Uninformed-unaware, n = 27).

COMPARING THE MEDICALLYINFORMED GROUPS

Physician Advice.—The two medically-informed groups indicated the
medical advice they received from their
physician and the people from whom
they sought advice in helping them
make their decision. The two groups differed significantly in their recall of the
physician’s advice. Fifty-seven per cent
(59) of the Informed-tested group felt
that they were told to have the test; another 25 per cent (26) said that they were
told the test was needed; 11 percent (11)
were referred to a genetics clinic; and 7

per cent (8) could not remember the advice. In contrast 60 per cent (84) of the
Informed-untested recalled receiving no
specific advice.

The remaining 40 per cent (57) of
Informed-untested reported they were
given one of the three physician responses (i.e., have the test, test was
needed, or referred to a genetics clinic),
an indication that these women chose
not to comply with their physician’s advice. A comparison between these latter
two categories (“‘advised” vs. “not advised’’) of respondents revealed no
significant differences on the study variables and thus, were treated collectively
as ““Informed-untested.”’

Risk Assessment.—The medicallyinformed women responded to a series
of questions that assessed their knowledge and attitudes about Down syndrome (DS) and the risks associated
with the procedure. Respondents identified from a list the groups of pregnant
women they considered “‘at risk” for DS
(Table 2). These data are presented in
descending order of risk. The first three
categories are actually associated with
increased risk. Based on percentage of
response, both groups correctly identified the order of these risk categories.
The tested group consistently attributed
more risk to the categories, especially
the first three.

54 Metheny et al.

The two groups differed in their estimates of the likelihood a 40-year-old
woman might have an infant with DS
(Table 3). The untested women were
more likely to consider maternal age unrelated to risk for DS. More of the tested
women than the untested women correctly identified the risk 1 in 50 to 100.
Nearly an equal percentage of both
groups either underestimated the risk or
made no estimate, the latter being an indication of uncertainty.

A question designed to identify the
respondent’s aversion to the risk of birth
defects, asked: “‘When would the risk of
having a baby with a birth defect get so
high that you would decide not to become pregnant?” The question contained seven possible choices ranging
from “any risk is too great” and “less
than 1 chance in 100 is too high a risk” to
“a 26 to 50 chance out of 100 is too high”
and “‘it is not for the person (couple) to
decide whether or not they are willing to
have a child.” The responses, collapsed
into categories of ‘“any-low,” ‘‘moderate,” “high” risk and “not one’s decision” appear in Table 4. Thirty-two per
cent (35) of the untested group compared to 3 per cent (2) of the tested
group felt that the couple should not
make this decision. More of the tested

Social Biology

women (57 per cent) than the untested
women (43 per cent) felt that any risk of
a birth defect justified avoiding the pregnancy.

The two medically-informed groups
differed in their estimates of the likelihood the procedure could injure the fetus. Sixty-one per cent (61) of those
tested gave it a low risk (< 1:100) while
36 per cent (46) of the untested made
the same estimate. Thirty per cent (30)
of the tested and 46 per cent (59) of the
untested women admitted they did not
know the risk.

The Informed-untested women expressed more objection to the procedure on religious grounds than did the
Informed-tested group. As seen in Table 5, nearly two-thirds of the untested
women compared to a fourth of the
tested women felt that their religious beliefs influenced their decision. A small
and nearly equal fraction of women
from both groups reported being undecided about the influence of their religious beliefs.

The two groups identified the factor(s) they considered most prior to
making their decisions about the procedure. Table 6 lists these responses. The
majority of the tested women considered their maternal age as the most im

© portant criterion in their decision to
have the procedure. The untested
group, on the other hand, focused on
the risk of the procedure to the fetus and
their feelings about abortion.

Five items of this question attempted
to identify concerns specific to the untested women. These items were inappropriate to ask of those taking the test,
since a woman in that group may have
received a positive diagnosis for aneuploidy. Three-fourths of the untested
women gave first consideration to “not

 

wanting an abortion for any reason.”
About a third assumed that the fetus
was normal, based in part on an uncomplicated pregnancy and no family history of birth defects.

The two groups differed in their reported insurance coverage. Seventyeight per cent (78) of the tested women
reported that their insurance paid all or
more than half of the cost of the procedure. Twenty-nine per cent (38) of the
untested women reported this same
level of coverage, but 59 per cent (76) of

this group admitted they did not know
the extent of their coverage if they were
to have had the procedure.

Predicting the Amniocentesis Decision.—A multiple regression analysis
was used to determine which study variables significantly correlated with the
amniocentesis decision (i.e., the
Informed-tested and Informed-untested
groupings). This procedure is equivalent to a two-group discriminant analysis. Only the study variables reaching
statistical significance in the chi-square
bivariate comparisons and logistic regressions of the multiple response items
were included in this analysis. The
results appear in Table 7. The equation
consisted of five significant predictors
and accounted for 63 per cent of the variability in the two-group classification.
The women’s assessment of their risk associated with maternal age showed the
strongest effect on this decision, fol

lowed by the physician’s advice. Insurance coverage for the cost of procedure
also significantly entered into this equation. The untested women showed more
concern for procedurally-related injury
to the fetus than the tested women, although this factor did not attain statistical significance. Women having fewer
pregnancies and smaller families and
less religious objection more often
elected for the procedure.

pregnancies (x = 4.10, + 2.21) than the
women in the untested (¥ = 6.07,
+ 2.95), the “aware” (¥ = 6.78, + 3.58)
and the “unaware” (¥ = 7.15, + 4.30
groups. Subsequently, the tested
women had smaller families with an average of 3.30 (+ 1.96) children com

pared to an average of 5.01 (+ 2.67)
children for the untested, 5.74 (+ 2.94)
children of the ‘‘aware”’ women, and an
average of 6.37 (+ 4.45) children among
the “unaware” women.

The groups differed sharply in the
perceived influence of their religious beliefs on the amniocentesis decision (Table 5). The Informed-tested women
were the least likely to feel that their religious beliefs would or did influence
their decision (23.5 per cent), while the
Informed-untested women considered
their religious beliefs as an important
factor in their decision (63.8 per cent).
The Uninformed-aware women also
gave or would give religious consideration (53.4 per cent) to amniocentesis.
The responses of the Uninformedunaware women to this question
showed no particular pattern.

Risk Comparisons.—The two medically-uninformed groups also completed
the two questions that assessed their
knowledge about their risk for DS.
These results appear in Tables 2, 3, and
4 which include for comparison the data
presented earlier on the two medicallyinformed groups. Based on their percentage ratings, the medicallyuninformed women, like the informed
groups, correctly identified the “‘at risk”
categories (Table 2). However the uninformed groups gave a higher “don’t
know’ response, and Uninformedunaware group ascribed less risk to all
the categories.

Table 3 displays the groups’ estimates
of the likelihood a 40-year-old women
might have an infant with DS. Both uninformed groups, but especially the “‘unaware” group, saw less of a relationship
between maternal age and the risk for
DS than did the medically-informed
women. All four groups had a high “‘no

response” rate, an indication that many
women had difficulty making this estimate.

Table 4 compares the four respondent groups on the maximum acceptable risk of having birth defects associated with a pregnancy before deciding to
avoid the pregnancy. The Uninformedunaware group split their responses between “any or a low risk” and “‘it is not
the person’s decision,” while the Uninformed-aware women responded more
diversely in a pattern similar to the untested respondents. The Uninformedunaware women were the most likely of
the groups to believe that couples do not
have the prerogative to make a decision
about becoming pregnant.

DISCUSSION

Our study sought to identify factors
pertinent to the utilization of amniocentesis. Despite the target population’s
general awareness of the test and recognition of their maternal-age risk and the
fact that the majority of the respondents
received medical advice about amniocentesis, most went unscreened. Only
38 per cent (105/271) of those reported
having knowledge of amniocentesis actually had the procedure. More than
likely, these tested women comprise a
generally well-educated, self-selected
group, cognizant and concerned about
their risk for birth defects, and whose
decision was strongly influenced by the
physician.

The physician’s advice plays a critical
role in this decision; yet several women
reported receiving no specific recommendation, an indication that many
physicians in Michigan during 1980 were
not routinely recommending amniocentesis for patients of advanced maternal
age. These patterns certainly must

Social Biology

reflect the factors identified by Verp and
Gerbie (1981), including physician
awareness of the appropriate indications, availability of services, physician
misconception about risks of the procedure, and physician resistance stemming
from personal or patients’ religious convictions. A significant proportion of
those receiving advice chose not to have
the procedure. Perhaps their previous
experiences with pregnancy gave them
confidence that this child was normal
and that the test was unnecessary. Others found the procedure objectionable
for moral reasons or weighed its benefits
of reassurance against the risk of injury
to the fetus. On the other hand, a significant portion of women in this survey
received no information about amniocentesis from their physician, which precluded them from the prenatal screening
decision. Although some knew of the
procedure, many were unaware of the
relationship between maternal age and
the risk for DS.

The limitations in study design and
response rate restrict the conclusions.
Data collected retrospectively, without
corroborative objective data on utilization rates and physician information,
and based on recall over sensitive issues
suffer error. The modest response rate
and the noted racial and socioeconomic
response biases limit its generalizability.
It offers a limited description of responses from four groups of women occurring naturally in the target population, some of which are underrepresented.

Despite its limitations, the findings
corroborate those found in the literature
on patients’ decisions about amniocentesis. This investigation determined that
the utilization of amniocentesis rests
significantly on several patient variables, with perceived risk due to maternal

age emerging as the most salient factor
(Davies and Doran, 1982). Knowledge
of age-related genetic risk for the pregnancy significantly affected acceptance
of amniocentesis (Ekwo et al., 1985).
Patients recognizing this risk seek assurance from amniocentesis that they have
a normal fetus (Davies and Doran,
1982; Dixson et al., 1981). The physician’s recommendation significantly affected this decision (Beeson and
Golbus, 1985; Davies and Doran, 1982;
Rothman, 1986). Patients’ insurance
coverage plays an important socioeconomic role in this decision (Seals et al.,
1985). Women choosing amniocentesis
tend to be better educated and have

- smaller families (NICHD, 1976; Davies

and Doran, 1982; Marion et al., 1980).
Religious convictions divide women on
their willingness to have the procedure,
especially those who would equate it
with or see abortion as its necessary consequence (Davies and Doran, 1982;
Fletcher, 1981; Kolker and Burke, 1987;
Rothman, 1986). The data suggest that
the tested women held a more liberal religious orientation toward amniocentesis, conception, birth defects, and abortion than the other groups. These
women might express more liberal
views on laws permitting abortion (Seals
et al., 1986). Tested women gave more
realistic odds of their age-related risk for
DS, influenced by their understanding
of the genetics of DS and their cognizance of the consequences of having a
child with DS (Ekwo et al., 1985), while
women not choosing amniocentesis
showed more concern about procedurally-related fetal injury and abortion
(Davies and Doran, 1982; Dixson, 1981;
Rothman, 1986).

The Health Belief Model (Janz and
Becker, 1975) provides a conceptual
framework for interpreting these

Amniocentesis Use and Risk Awareness

59

results. This model assumes that individuals take specific health action based
on their value of avoiding illness, and
their estimate this action will reduce the
threat of the illness. Health action is affected by individual perceptions of the
severity of the disease and personal susceptibility, modified by sociodemographic characteristics and exposure to
or information about the disease. In selecting the course of action, individuals
will weigh the perceived benefits (e.g.,
efficacy, reassurance) of an action
against the perceived drawbacks (e.g.,
expense, safety, inconvenience, etc.).
Susceptibility and severity motivates the
action, and the benefits (minus the
drawbacks) set the course of action (Rosenstock, 1974).

A test of the Health Belief Model
within the context of genetic screening
for Tay-Sachs disease (Becker et al.,
1975) lends support to its application
here. Becker et al. (1975) found that
participants in the screening program
felt more susceptible to being carriers of
the Tay-Sachs gene than nonparticipants, and that perceived severity affected participation levels. The match
between a couple’s health beliefs on the
severity and susceptibility measures
helped predict the likelihood of their
participation in screening program. In
the present study, the woman’s perceptions of her susceptibility to DS, and her
perceptions of having a DS child proved
to be key factors in her decision about
amniocentesis. The Health Belief
Model suggests that the physician’s recommendations, the father’s advice, and
information from the media would serve
as cues to take health action (prenatal
screen). These action cues, coupled with
the patients’ sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., family size, and insurance
coverage), would influence the decision

60 Metheny et al.

to have the procedure. Based on this
model, amniocentesis would provide
the benefit of reassurance to those
women concerned with their risk for DS
while those objecting to the procedure
might attribute to themselves less personal risk for DS and perceive their religious convictions and feelings about
abortion as barriers to having the test.
The medically-uninformed women
would remain unscreened, not from
choice but from an unawareness of their
susceptibility to the risks of DS.

Some researchers (Beeson and
Golbus, 1985; Lippman-Hand and Fraser, 1979) argue that genetic counselors
should help patients understand the
consequences and burden that DS entails, rather than diverting their attention to its mathematical probabilities, as
some recommend (Pauker and Pauker,
1979). Research results continue to
question patients’ understanding of
quantitative risks (Chase et al., 1986).
The present study, which demonstrated
a relationship between amniocentesis
use and patient knowledge and concerns
about their risk, suggests that the basic
issue in antenatal screening is not the
counseling technique; it is making the
population of women with advanced
maternal age cognizant that their age
places their baby at high risk for congenital abnormalities. Knowledge of the genetic risk for a pregnancy increases acceptance of amniocentesis. Knowing the
exact odds of this risk may be far less im
Social Biology

portant at this stage (Ekwo et al., 1985;
Evers-Kiebooms and Van De Berghe,
1979), as candidates are more concerned with reducing uncertainty than
knowing specific risk.

The Health Belief Model suggests
that widespread media attention and
physician activism directed toward educating this population of their risk and
the safety of the procedure, and which
clearly distinguish amniocentesis from a
commitment to abortion, should
prompt more women to actively seek
genetic counseling. Provided that the
services and copayment plans to cover
the costs are available, racial and socioeconomic differences should not inhibit
its utilization (Sokol et al., 1980; Marion
et al., 1980). Perhaps new reproductive
technologies, such as chorionic villi sampling, that detect aneuploidy within the
first few weeks of pregnancy will reduce
some of the problems of antenatal testing associated with amniocentesis,
namely detection late in pregnancy and
the long waiting period for results. Even
with these new technologies, the education problem will remain. Until this hurdle 1s overcome, demonstrating the
most effective counseling strategy for
helping patients make their decision
must remain a secondary issue.
