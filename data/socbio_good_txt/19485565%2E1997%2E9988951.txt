How Do We Interpret the Recent
Dramatic Increase in the Time to
Earn a Ph.D.?

ABSTRACT: A 1962 recipient of a Ph.D. was an average of 10.13 years from receipt of a B.A.; a
1992 recipient was an average of 12.55 years. Some authors have suggested that if the B.A.-year
cohorts were compared instead of the Ph.D.-year cohorts, the average time to earn a Ph.D.
would not show such a drastic increase. The author recognizes the problem with the Ph.D.-year
data, but uses these data with a standardization-decomposition technique to show that 75 per
cent of the increase in the time between the B.A. and the Ph.D. in 1992 was due to the change in
the age-sex structure of Ph.D. recipients in favor of more women and older persons.

Total time-to-degree (TTD) measures
the number of years elapsed between receipt of the baccalaureate degree and the
Ph.D. (Ries and Thurgood, 1993). There
has been a dramatic increase in mean
TTD in the United States over the last
three decades. For example, the mean
TTD for doctorate recipients in 1992 was
12.55 years—an increase of 23.9 per cent
from the mean TTD of 10.13 years in
1962. In the field of education, this increase during the same 30-year period
was even faster (30.0 per cent)—from
14.61 years in 1962 to 18.99 years in
1992 (Tables 1 and 2).

Students, faculty members, and those
involved in making policies for education
in the country have been concerned about
the drastic rise in the length of time it
takes to earn a doctorate. This concern
has resulted in calls for reform in graduate education by media commentators
and other interested persons.

In a recent paper, Bowen et al. (1991)
have argued that there has been, in fact,
some rise in the average TTD in recent
years but that the overall picture is not at
all as bad as the data seem to indicate. The
average TID is derived from students
grouped by the year in which they were
awarded doctorates and, according to these
authors, this Ph.D.-year method of aggregation produces a highly misleading picture of trends in average TTD because of
the steady fall in the sizes of entering cohorts to graduate school. They have suggested that the same data be regrouped by
the year in which recipients of doctorates
received their B.A. degrees. Reorganization of the data in this manner has since
been suggested in another paper by Bowen
et al. (1992). The B.A.-year method of aggregation, according to these authors, is
free of the potential “statistical bias” that
afflicts the Ph.D.-year method. Using the
B.A.-year approach, they have estimated

247
248

that the reported Ph.D.-year median for
1988 overstates the time a typical humanities graduate student spends earning a doctorate by as much as two years.

While Bowen et al. (1991) are right in
pointing out the problem of overestimation
of TTD based on the Ph.D.-year approach
and in suggesting the use of the B.A.year method of aggregation as a solution,
this latter approach has a problem of its

= own which is related to the availability of
‘data to study the pattern of TTD over
time. The mean TTD for the 1962 and
5 1992 B.A.-year cohorts, for example, will
2 not be known until around the years 2020
96 and 2050, respectively (there was an 825 year old Ph.D. recipient in 1992). In orcs der to avoid the problem of long wait, if
= we calculate truncated measures for B.A.year cohorts after, say, ten years, as the
Spauthors have suggested, we will introduce
6a different kind of “statistical bias” be= cause the relationship between the two
6 sides of the truncation point is likely to
ee change over time.
8 The objective of the present paper is to
= handle the problem of overestimation of
= TTD by the Ph.D.-year method of aggregation by an alternative approach using
"p> the same Ph.D.-year cohorts and not re§ grouping the data by the B.A.-year
= method. This new approach also recog8 nizes the steady fall in the sizes of entering cohorts to graduate school, but takes
account of this factor by standardizing
the mean TTD’s of the Ph.D.-year cohorts by the age structures of these cohorts. Depending on the availability of
data cross-classified by other factors,
such as gender and broad field, it is also
possible to standardize simultaneously
with respect to several factors and at the
same time decompose the difference between the mean TTD’s of two years into

the additive effects of these factors (Das
Gupta, 1991, 1993). The data for the
Ph.D. recipients of 1962 and 1992 are
used for the illustration of these techniques.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

ANALYSIS OF PH.D.’S IN A BROAD FIELD
BY AGE AND GENDER

For 1962,

N,; = number of Ph.D. recipients in
age group i and gender j,

N, = number of Ph.D. recipients in
age group J,

N,= number of Ph.D. recipients in
gender j,

N = total Ph.D. recipients in the
field,

T,; = mean TTD of Ph.D. recipients
in age group i and gender j,

T = mean TTD of Ph.D. recipients
in the field.

For 1992, the above quantities are denoted by Nin Nj, Np N, tip and ¢ , respectively.

RESULTS

The basic data used for our analysis
are the doctorate recipients and their
SI mean TTD’s in 1962 and 1992 cross6 Classified by nine age groups, seven
= broad fields, and gender. These data in
© summary form are shown in Table 1. The
o overall mean TTD’s for all fields together
< are 10.13 and 12.55 years for 1962 and
>. 1992, respectively. It is obvious from the
= data that there are two facts which con= tribute significantly to this difference.
S The more important fact is that the mean
= TTD’s in both 1962 and 1992 increased
‘S with age and that a much higher percent‘S age of older people earned Ph.D.’s in
£1992 (percentages of Ph.D. recipients
5 aged 35 and above are 34.0 and 47.5 in
‘= 1962 and 1992, respectively). The other
- fact is that the mean TTD’s for women
were higher than those for men in both
1962 and 1992 and that a much higher
3 percentage of women earned Ph.D.’s in
"e 1992 (10.8 per cent in 1962 as against
5 37.4 per cent in 1992). It is not obvious

from the data whether the difference in
the distribution of broad field for 1962
and 1992 had a positive or negative effect
on the difference between the overall
mean TTD’s. Similar observations can be
made on the seven broad fields from the
summary data in Table 1.

Table 2 gives a more accurate picture
of the effects of age, gender, and broad
field obtained by applying the techniques

scribed in the preceding section. For all
fields together, we may summarize the results as follows:

(1). The mean TTD’s for 1962 and
1992 are, respectively, 10.13 and 12.55
years (an increase of 23.9 per cent). Their
difference of 2.42 is the total effect of the
differences in age, field, gender, and agefield-gender-specific mean TTD’s.

(2). If the distributions of field, gender, and age-field-gender-specific mean
TTD’s were identical in 1962 and 1992,
and only the distribution of age varied, as
it did, then the mean TTD’s for 1962 and
1992 would be 10.53 and 11.98 years (an
increase of 13.8 per cent). The difference
of 1.45 between them is, therefore, the effect of the difference in the age distribution.

(3). If the distributions of age, gender,
and age-field-gender-specific mean TTD’s
were identical in 1962 and 1992, and
only the distribution of field varied, as it
did, then the mean TTD’s for 1962 and
1992 would be 11.26 and 11.23 years (a
decrease of 0.3 per cent). The difference
of —0.03 between them is, therefore, the
effect of the difference in the field distribution.

(4). If the distributions of age, field,
and age-field-gender-specific mean TTD’s
were identical in 1962 and 1992, and
only the distribution of gender varied, as
it did, then the mean TTD’s for 1962 and
1992 would be 11.06 and 11.45 years (an
increase of 3.5 per cent). The difference
of 0.39 between them is, therefore, the effect of the difference in the gender distribution.

(5). If the distributions of age, field,
and gender were identical in 1962 and
1992, and only the distribution of agefield-gender-specific mean TTD’s varied,
as it did, then the mean TTD’s for 1962

CONCLUSIONS

By using the data for the Ph.D.-year
cohorts, I show that during the 30-year
period 1962-1992 the crude mean TTD’s
increased by 23.9, 20.7, 15.3, 21.6, 20.8,
20.2, 30.0, and 20.3 per cents, respectively, in all fields together, the physical
sciences, engineering, life sciences, social
sciences, humanities, education, and in
the professional/other. When the mean
TTD’s are standardized by age and gender (and by age, field, and gender in the
case of all fields), these percentages come
down to 5.5, 4.4, 6.1, 6.4, 3.7, 3.2, 8.1,
and 5.4, respectively. Again, in all fields
and in seven individual areas, respectively, 74.8, 76.8, 58.7, 68.4, 80.7, 83.0,
70.3, and 71.6 per cents of the total difference between the crude mean TTD’s in

1962 and 1992 can be attributed to the
differences in the factors age and gender
(age, field, and gender in the case of all
fields), and predominantly age. The field
of engineering in 1992 is the only place
where women, on the average, took less
time than men to earn a Ph.D. (Table 1).
This phenomenon translates into a negative gender effect for engineering in
Table 2.

As we noted earlier, total time-todegree (TTD) measures the number of
years elapsed between receipt of the baccalaureate and the Ph.D. Many students
do not spend this entire period of time in
graduate school in active pursuit of the
advanced degree. They may choose to do
“other things” for a period of time such
as working, serving in the Peace Corps,
serving in the military, raising children,
establishing a spouse in a career, etc. If
the percentage of time spent in doing
other things during TTD shows an increasing trend over the years, then the use
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

256

of TTD as a measure of time spent on active pursuit of the degree may give the
false impression that students are taking
increasingly more time to complete their
degrees once they enroll in the program.
Obviously, the research on this issue
would be more precise in terms of registered time-to-degree (RTD) which gauges
the amount of time an individual was actually enrolled in graduate school, including master’s degrees and enrollment in
nondegree programs (Ries and Thurgood,
1993). If, during 1962-1992, for example, RTD remained unchanged but TTD
increased, that finding would clearly indicate that this increase in TTD was solely
due to students’ spending increasingly
more time in non-academic activities following the baccalaureate. However, as we
see in Table 3, both median RTD and median TTD increased during 1962-1992 in
each and every field of study. As a matter
of fact, the per cent increase in RTD was
higher than that in TTD during this period for all fields together and for individual fields except for education. Even in
terms of absolute increase, both median
RTD and median TTD for all fields together showed the same increase of 1.7
years during 1962-1992. Therefore, there
has been a significant increase in the average time to earn a Ph.D. in recent years.
How do we interpret this increase?
There are primarily two reasons why it is
taking more time in recent years to earn a
doctorate, and both these reasons are demographic in nature. Traditionally, those

Brief Reports

 

Social Biology

individuals who complete their degrees at
older ages take more time to do so compared to younger Ph.D. recipients. However, at the same time, the percentage of
Ph.D. recipients at older ages has substantially increased in recent years. These
two phenomena together are pushing the
mean TID upward, as happened during
1962-1992. Likewise, traditionally, women
take more time than men to complete
their Ph.D.’s, but the percentage of
women among the Ph.D. recipients in a
year has shown significant increase over
time. Again, these two factors together
are responsible for inflating the mean
TTD, as happened during 1962-1992.

Thus, about 75 per cent of the actual
increase in mean TTD can be attributed
to the change in the age-sex structure
of Ph.D. recipients during 1962-1992.
Therefore, the “real” increase in mean
TTD is only about 25 per cent of what
the difference of the overall mean TTD’s
for 1962 and 1992 indicates. In other
words, the real increase is 0.61 year (instead of 2.42 years), i.e., about 7 months
over a thirty-year period. This increase
does not seem to be so alarming that students would be discouraged from pursuing doctoral programs.
