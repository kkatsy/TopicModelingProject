ABSTRACT: Data are reported on ages of menarche, first marriage and first childbirth, migration, venereal disease, birth control, birth spacing and on completed fertility rate in populations
of Central Nepal living at low (8,500 feet) and high altitude (12,400 feet). The high-altitude
population reported a significantly lower completed fertility rate which could be partly accounted for by later age at marriage and first childbirth and increased birth spacing. Longer
post-partum ammenorhea and breast feeding did not account for the increased average preg
nancy gap.

Anecdotal observations made by
Spanish settlers in South America led to
the suspicion that fertility was impaired
at high altitude. Physiological studies
since the 1930’s and more recent demographic analyses of census data, as well
as small-scale anthropological expeditions, have tended to show that fertility
is lower at high altitude. This is possibly
due to the effects of hypoxia and cold,
although the exact reasons for the reduction are not entirely clear. Baker and
Dutt (1972) and Weitz et al. (1978) have
suggested that a fertility rate, much
lower than might be expected of a community practicing little birth control, is
found among high-altitude populations
when compared with similar lowaltitude populations. Further evidence
to that obtained from Andean and Nepalese populations has been demonstrated in another South America sample (Abelson, 1976) and in the USSR
(Mirrakhinov, 1978). Baker (1978) has
concluded that high altitude does indeed
limit fertility.

ining completed fertility rate (CFR) in
Highland and Lowland villages in Central Nepal and relating rate differences
to age at menarche, age at first child
birth, age at first marriage, incidence of
venereal disease, birth control (vasectomy or hysterectomy), length of postpartum ammenorhea, and breast feeding.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Two similar populations were compared. the first was that of Muktinath
and the nearby villages of Purang and
Jharkot which lie at altitudes of 12,200
to 12,400 feet. This group is the highaltitude population. These people originate from Western Tibet and speak
Bhotia, a form of Tibetan. The economy relies on agriculture and some trading, the latter activity undertaken by the
menfolk who may be away for two or
three months in a year, The second population studied was in Larjung and surrounding villages which lie at altitudes
of 8,200 to 8,500 feet in Kali Gandaki
Valley. These lowland peoples are of

Tibeto-Burman extraction and speak
Thakali. The economy relies on both agriculture and trading. Both economies
have a pastoralist and now tourist element. While the people at high altitude
are Buddhist, those at low altitude are
partly Hindu-ized in custom and ritual.
Anthropologists working in the area
consider that there has been little
change in life style due to this recent effect. Buddhist beliefs and ritual still persist. There appear to be no great economic differences between the
populations (Ramble, personal communication). In both societies pregnancy follows marriage.

Subjects were obtained by visiting as
many houses as possible accompanied
by an interpreter. All data reported in
this paper were obtained by direct questioning through the use of a male interpreter in high-altitude villages and a female interpreter in low-altitude villages.
Both interpreters were local to their
area and spoke good English. Since reliance is made on recalled information,
under-reporting of births cannot be excluded.

CFR is defined as the number of live
births born to a woman during her reproductive lifespan (Bangham, 1980).
Fertility histories were taken from post
Social Biology

menopausal women over the age of 45
years. It should be noted that CFR values include nulliparous women.

RESULTS

Table 1 summarizes the results for
the mean ages of menarche, first marriage, first childbirth, and completed
fertility rate (total births) in highland
and lowland women. There was no
significant difference in reported menarcheal ages between highlanders and
lowlanders (F(1,70)=2.16, p=N.S.).
Age at first marriage and first childbirth
were both significantly later in high!anders (F(1,70)=6.80, p<0.01,
F(1,65) = 13.60, p<0.0005, respectively). Completed fertility rate was
significantly lower in highlanders
(F(1,82) = 6.80, p < 0.016).

It would appear that the reduced fertility rate at high altitude can be partly
attributable to later age at marriage and
later first childbirth. Other factors, for
instance, husband absenteeism and remarriage, have also been suggested as
possible contributors to the observed
difference (Bangham and Sacherer,
1980).

Even with the initial analyses, the relationship between CFR and these ages

is only indirect. A more realistic approach is to determine what effect several factors have on the variance of
CFR. This paper presents the results of
a multiple regression analysis using nine
dependent variables. The variables
were ages of marriage, first childbirth
and menarche, the average gap between
pregnancies, the average amount of
time the husband was away, the number
of marriages, presence or absence of venereal disease at some time, whether
birth control practiced, and altitude status.

The results of this analysis are summarized in Table 2. The analysis was organized such that the dependent variable making the largest contribution to
CFR variance was included first, the second largest contributor was included
next, and so on. There are several important findings: (a) Only three dependent variables (average pregnancy gap,
age at first childbirth, and presence or
absence of venereal disease) independently made a significant contribution to
CFR variance. (b) Consequently, the
other six variables did not separately

contribute a statistically significant
amount to CFR variance. (c) Even so,
they did contribute to the explained
Sums of Squares. In total, the nine variables accounted for 47.2 per cent of the
variance in CFR.

In some ways the finding that differences in CFR are due to average pregnancy gap is not surprising. If total reproductive span is not significantly
different between highland and lowland
peoples and CFR is reduced in highlanders, then the average pregnancy gap
must be greater.

One possible explanation for the increased gap could be increased duration
of breastfeeding with concomitantly
later restart of the menstrual cycle in
highlanders relative to lowlanders. In
order to test this hypothesis, a younger
group of high and low altitude women
were questioned on these points. The
results are shown in Table 3. There were
no significant differences either in duration of breastfeeding (F(1,47) =0.25,
p=0.62) or in months to restart menstruation (F(1,57)=0.41, p=0.53) between highland and lowland groups.

DISCUSSION

The overall completed fertility rate
found in the present study was 4.0. This
value is significantly lower than the
value reported by Bangham and Sacherer (1980) for a Nepalese sample,
and it is also lower than the value reported by MacFarlane (1976) for the
Gurungs, a hill tribe in Central Nepal. If
nulliparous women are excluded, the
overall rate rises to close to 5, which is
closer to the value reported by MacFarlane. However, the high-altitude
CFR data do not differ significantly
from those reported by Weitz et al.
(1978) or Gupta (1978). Weitz et al. also
demonstrated an effect of cultural factors on fertility.

The high/low altitude CFR difference
was highly significant and, in keeping
with other Nepalese samples, indicated
increased fertility in low altitude peoples. What can account for this observed
difference? In an attempt to explain the
difference we examined the relationship
between CFR and age of menarche, age
of marriage, and age of first childbirth as
well as considering the effects of migra

tion, birth control, venereal disease,
mortality, and average pregnancy gap.

In this study the mean menarcheal
age of 16.4 years, although high by
Western standards, is not dissimilar to
those found by Bangham and Sacherer
(1980, 16.3 years), Pawson (1978, 16.1
years) and Weitz et al. (1978, 16.8
years). However, unlike other studies,
this survey failed to show a significant
difference between menarcheal age between girls living at moderate altitudes
and those living at high altitude. Consequently, the contribution of age of menarche to the explained variance in CFR
was less than 1 per cent.

The age of marriage and age of first
childbirth accounted for over 16 per cent
of the explained variance in CFR. Lowaltitude women married four and a half
years earlier, on the average, than the
high-altitude woman, while the interval
between marriage and first childbirth
was very similar in both groups. Consequently, some of the observed difference in completed fertility can be explained by the difference in marital age
but not by the interval between marriage and first childbirth. Our results are

in keeping with Bangham and Sacherer
(1980) but differ from those of CruzCoke (1967) and Abelson et al. (1974)
who found that mean age at first live
birth did not vary greatly with altitude.

We also considered the effects of migration, mortality, birth control, and venereal disease in relation to CFR. There
was no evidence from the analyses to indicate that husband’s absenteeism or remarriage had any marked effect. Reported birth control (vasectomy and
hysterectomy) and venereal disease
were higher in the low-altitude sample
than the high-altitude population. In
fact, the high altitude data revealed a
complete absence of venereal disease
which probably reflects inaccuracy in reporting. However, even if there was a
modest degree of venereal disease in the
high-altitude sample it would be insufficient to explain the observed different
in CFR.

The other major contributor to the
analysis of variance was average pregnancy gap. In our study the lowland
groups, birth spacing averaged 2.62 years
and the highland groups’ spacing averaged 4.35 years. Abelson et al. (1974)
also found a much closer birth spacing at
low altitude than at high altitude. In our
study birth spacing accounted for nearly
half of the explained variance in CFR.

The second part of the study concentrated on trying to explain the observed
increase in pregnancy gap. Obviously if
breast feeding continues for a longer
period in high-altitude women there
would be a concomitant delay in recommencement of menstruation. We tested
this hypothesis by questioning a younger
group of high- and low-altitude women
and found no difference in reported duration in breastfeeding or in postpartum ammenorhea.

 

Fertility in Nepal 69

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

The high-altitude population has a
lower completed fertility rate than that at
low altitude. Menarcheal age is reported
to occur at the same age in each population. After average pregnancy gap, age
at first childbirth, occurence of venereal
disease, and age at marriage were removed by the step-wise regression and
analysis, there was no residual difference in CFR between high- and lowaltitude populations. It was not possible
to explain the lowered CFR as being due
to longer post-partum ammenorhea or
breastfeeding. It could be due to lowering of biological fecundity at high altitude, or simply a matter of choice, or a
difference in spontaneous abortion rate.
Bongaarts (1976) has suggested that the
latter would have little effect on the fertility rate since a 10 per cent rise in spontaneous abortion would lower the fertility by less than 1 per cent. The
difference might reflect human reproductive hormone differences between
high- and low-altitude populations. Further research will be required to determine whether or not differences in CFR
can be explained by variation in these
factors.
