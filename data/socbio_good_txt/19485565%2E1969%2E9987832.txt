It has been reported that infants with
Down’s syndrome show high mortality during the neonatal period. The most common
causes given for these early deaths are
cardiac malformations and infections of the
respiratory tract (Penrose and Smith, 1966).
In view of recent observations that low birth
weight infants accounted for a significant
proportion of perinatal mortality (Brimblecombe and Asford, 1968; Ahvenainen and
Terho, 1968), it was thought of value to
investigate low birth weight and early death
in patients with Down’s syndrome.

Data were obtained from a retrospective
study on infants with Down’s syndrome in
metropolitan Atlanta from January, 1960
to December, 1968. Of 174 affected children,
142 (69 male, 73 female) were white and 32
(14 male, 18 female) were Negro. Thirty-six
of the 174 subjects weighed 2,500 gm. or
less at birth (Table 1), representing a fre

quency of 21%. These included 26 white (9
male, 17 female) and 10 Negro (4 male, 6
female). Thirteen of these 36 children died,
7 during the first 24 hours of life while the
other 6 survived from 1 to 29 months.
Among the 138 patients who weighed over
2,500 gm. at birth only 14 died, 4 during the
first 24 hours of life while the other 10 lived
from 1 to 40 months. The difference in the
mortality rates between the low birth weight
and normal birth weight Down’s syndrome
children was statistically significant (P <
0.001). This finding indicated that low birth
weight played an important role in the mortality of patients with Down’s disease. Although low birth weight is often the result of
a multiplicity of etiological factors (Chen
et al., in press), its prognostic value with
regard to mortality in Down’s syndrome is
reflected by the present data.

Since a high childhood mortality rate was
also observed among all low birth weight
children, an evaluation was conducted to determine whether low birth weight played a

more important role than Down’s syndrome
in early childhood death. Numerical data
for the general population available for such
a comparison are reported by Ahvenainen
and Terho (1968). Their finding of a 25%
mortality rate among low birth weight Finnish children is in close agreement with that
reported by Brimblecombe and Asford
(1968) for the population in Great Britain
(23%). Statistical analysis revealed no

implicate low birth weight rather than
Down’s syndrome as the important contributing factor in early childhood death.
