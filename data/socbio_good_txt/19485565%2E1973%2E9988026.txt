Influence of Urbanization and

Industrialization on Birth and Death Rates

Michael D. Lebowitz

Diseases, Tucson, Arizona

Japan has developed rapidly within the
last hundred years and is now the third
largest industrial power in the world. During this development process, in which
urbanization increased as rapidly as industrialization, the demographic processes
changed drastically. The changes in mortality and natality related to urbanization
and industrialization, and associated population increase, are of practical and theoretical interest. The increase in population
and changes in population structure and
composition are of obvious interest. Group
differentials in mortality and natality, and
thus population increase, are also important.
These differentials by industrial, urban, and
occupational status clarify the demographic
states of population segments. Examining
differentials by industrial and urban status
over time illuminate trends of change. The
differences found also have many policy
and planning ramifications.

Japan furnishes an excellent model to
study these changes and differentials. It is
developed, is public-health conscious, and
has good data. The historical situation in
Japan can be compared to historical changes
in the Western countries and can also be
compared to changes occurring in now developing countries. Such comparisons would
increase our understanding of the demo
graphic transitions and permit clarification
of ongoing demographic events.

Mexico is another country in which these
changes can be examined. It is a developing
country with rapidly changing demographic
characteristics. It is public-health conscious
and has good data for this period of rapid
change. It furnishes another model in which
changes in differentials can be examined.
Comparisons between the two countries
should also prove useful in clarifying the
various changes occurring with development.

In presently developed Western countries, with their history of industrialization
and urbanization as the death rate declined,
the urban-rural, the industrial-nonindustrial
and occupational differentials in mortality
declined (Darick, 1951; Hansluwka, 1963;
Logan, 1954; Lorimer, 1946; Quint, 1959;
Rogers, Yamamoto, and Messinger, 1966;
Spengler and Duncan, 1963; Szabady,
1964; Thomas, 1941). This trend in mortality has also been observed in the recently
developed countries (Carleton, 1965; Dorn,
1964; Miro, 1966; Smith, 1960; Szabady,
1964) and is thought to have occurred in
the developing countries. In a similar manner, as the birth rate declined in the nowdeveloped countries, the various differentials
in natality declined (Notestein and Sal

lume, 1957; Penrose, 1934; Westoff, 1954).
It is known that the death rate generally
declined before the birth rate, and the declines within the urban, industrial and/or
occupational strata generally occurred first
in the higher strata for both rates.

The demographic transition in the developed countries generally proceeded from a
period of relatively high mortality and fertility to one of decreasing mortality with
relatively high fertility to one of relatively
low mortality with decreasing fertility to
the final (present) stage of low mortalityfertility (Dorn, 1964; Hansluwka, 1963;
Spengler and Duncan 1963). There were,
of course, countries in which the transition
took a different form (Spengler and Duncan, 1963).

As stated, these changes during the transition were status dependent. This is true
regardless of whether status is defined in
terms of urban-rural, industrial-nonindustrial, occupational, or socioeconomic differences. These dimensions are highly correlated. Studies utilizing different dimensions,
separately or jointly, have found similar
results (Darick, 1951; Guralnick, 1964;
Hansluwka, 1963; Leblanc, 1931; Logan,
1954; Lorimer, 1946; Menoguchi, 1954;
Moriyama and Guralnick, 1956; Notestein,
1966; Quint, 1959; Rogers, Yamamoto,
and Messinger, 1966; Szabady, 1964;
Thomas, 1941; Westoff, 1954). Industrialization and urbanization were highly correlated in the developed countries and are
highly correlated in the developing countries; and in both cases, occupational group
classifications of subpopulations conform

1 Westoff (1954) has demonstrated this clearly
in the United States. He examined the rate of the
number of children ever born per 1,000 females
ages 15-44 (married with husband present),
1910-52, standardized for age, by occupationalsocial class. In 1910, the ratio of lowest class rate
to highest class rate was 1.722; it was reduced to
1.454 in 1952. In 1910, the ratio of farmers’ rate
to highest class rate was 2.055; it was reduced
to 1.636 in 1952. Thus, the reduced differential
is clear in the United States.

to industrial-urban classifications (Lorimer,
1946; Menoguchi, 1954; Mexico, Direccion
General de Estadistica, 1954; Moriyama
and Guralnick, 1956); Taueber, 1958;
Thomas, 1941; Westoff 1954). Urbanization and industrialization are related phenomena in time and place. Differential
effects on mortality and natality are related
to living conditions, medical attention, literacy, etc., and these in turn are and have
been directly related to the industrial-urban
status of populations (Coale and Hoover,
1958; LeBlanc, 1931; Lorimer, 1946;
Penrose, 1934; Roemer, 1964; Taueber,
1958). These factors are only some of the
major determinants of population change.
There are many others (Coale and Hoover,
1958; Dorn, 1964; Horwitz and Burke,
1966; Lorimer, 1946; Menoguchi, 1954;
Notestein, 1966; Penrose, 1934; Somoza,
1969; Spengler and Duncan, 1963; Taueber, 1964; Thomas, 1941). This paper only
examines changes and differentials related
to industrialization and urbanization.
Migration is one of the phenomena producing changes in population size and
structure. International and internal migration had large influences in the developed
countries in the past and in the developing
countries through the present. Internal urban to rural migration has been a constant
factor in urbanization and industrialization.
Such migration influences between groups.
In turn, the new settings and the urbanization-industrialization process influences
demographic behavior (Hatt, 1957; Hauser
and Schnore, 1965; Spengler and Duncan,
1963). The study of migration influences
is highlighted elsewhere (Davie, 1949;
Dorn, 1964; Durand and Pelaez, 1965;
Elizaga, 1965; Morse, 1964; Neiva, 1965;
Rycroft and Clemmer, 1963; Spengler
and Duncan, 1963; Taueber, 1964), and
these influences have been considered for
Japan and Mexico in some of the original
data sources (Arriaga, 1967a, 19676, 1968,

Ochoa, 1955; Rycroft and Clemmer,
1963a,5; Tauber, 1958). This was in general a slow phenomenon in the Western
countries.

The most-quoted demonstration of
changes in status differentials over the
demographic transition is the EnglandWales experience. As shown in Figure 1,

less regular in males and in married females.
Among married females before 1950, the
rates were higher in V than in J; therefore,
the difference in males may be of social
(industrial-urban) differences rather than
of purely occupational differences. Though
not shown, the differentials in fertility similarly declined though later in time (Logan,
1954) (see footnote 1).

Has this happened in more recently developed countries, like Japan (or an East

as the death rate declined in the period
1910-1953, the occupational-social status
differentials in mortality also declined (Logan, 1953). Prior to 1950, there was an
uninterrupted upward gradient from I to V
in mortality. In 1950, the difference was

European country, like Hungary), and/or
is this happening in presently developing
countries, like Mexico?

The declines in the death rate in the now
developed countries are credited primarily
to advances in medical technology and their
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:33 08 December 2015

availability, improvements in standards of
living, and general increases in wealth
(Coale and Hoover, 1958; Horwitz and
Burke, 1966; Spengler and Duncan, 1963).
In the presently undeveloped countries, the
application of already-advanced medical
technology has been the primary source of
decline (Horwitz and Burke, 1966). The
decline in the birth rate in the now developed countries has been attributed to
changes in the economic value of children,
change in family patterns, the decline in
death rate (specifically, the infant and early
childhood mortality), advances in contraceptive devices, and both improved knowledge of contraceptives and access to them
(Dorn, 1964; Spengler and Duncan, 1963).

It has been shown that the trends in
the bith rate in some developing or just
developed countries are undoubtedly related
to the trend in the death rate (Arriaga,
1967a). Both this overall relationship in
the trends of mortality and natality and the
ramifications inherent in these trends in
the socioeconomic differentials of both mortality and natality need to be explored.
Since the birth and death processes in a
population are of major significance in regard to the structure of the population and
changes in that population, a better delineated relationship between the two processes
yields vital information about population
change, structure, and associated factors.
If such a relationship can be shown, and if
the assumption that mortality levels affect
natality levels is accepted, then further
hypotheses are posed and relationships are
sought.

Japan furnishes appropriate data for the
investigation of this problem. Mexico, a
developing nation, also has experienced
significant decrements in death rates in
recent decades. It, too, has sufficient and
satisfactory data to be used as a companison. The years 1920-1950 will be studied
for Japan and 1900-1960 for Mexico.

Social Biology

Japan has developed rapidly in the last
hundred years, since the Meiji Restoration
(1868). Its social and economic development have been phenomenal, with rapid
increases in per capita income, per capita
net national product, industrial activity,
education, health care and social benefits
(Allen, 1950; Ishii, 1937; Lockwood, 1954;
Menoguchi, 1954; Taueber, 1958; Trewartha, 1965). Prior to the restoration, it
was similar in demographic characteristics
to thirteenth-century France or Great Britain (Trewartha, 1965). Its population was
only 27.2 million in 1852, almost all rural
or small town. The population was up to
100 million in the 1960’s. By 1868, Japan
had several localities with one hundred
thousand or more population. Economic development paralleled population growth
during 1872-1940 (about 1.5% per year)
(Trewartha, 1965). Japan has had a continuous decrease in its agricultural population (from 75% of gainfully occupied in
agriculture/forestry in 1872 down to 31%
in 1960), a continuous increase in the
proportion in industry, and a continuous
increase in the proportion urban (in
10,000-+- settlements: 12.9% in 1888 to
89.6% in 1960).

Mexico has been developing since the
end of its revolution (1921). Industrial
activity continues to increase, as does per
capita net national product. Per capita
income has been increasing. The illiteracy
rate has decreased to 38% in the 10 and
over ages (1960). Mexico’s population
grew during 1921-1960 from 12.6 million
to 34.9 million, and its population is presently one of the fastest growing in the
world. The proportion of the gainfully
occupied in agriculture/forestry has remained fairly constant at about 57%. It
has been urbanizing rapidly since 1900.
By 1960, the proportion urban had risen
from 17.6% to 41.9% in 5000-+ areas;
12.3% to 37.2% in 10,000-+- areas; 3.3
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:33 08 December 2015

Vol. 20, No. 1

to 23.9% in 100,000-++ areas; and from
zero to 13.3% in areas of a million or
more. Mexico has been undergoing rapid
socioeconomic and demographic change
(Arriaga, 19675, 1970; Collver, 1965;
Carleton, 1965; De la Pena, 1954; Miro,
1966; Moreno, 1958; Ochoa, 1955; Rycroft and Clemmer, 1963¢,b; Somoza,
1969).

The fact that Japan and Mexico have
different cultures, both of which differ
from Western cultures, would increase the
strength of initial generalizations if indeed
similar vital trends can be found for these
countries.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

It is believed that the grouping of prefecture/states by urbanization and industrial type represents a relatively crude
stratification model. Socioeconomic groups
cannot be directly represented by such
strata,

Both countries have had good census
and vital statistics for at least 45 years.
In Japan, trustworthy data on death rates
are lacking for the period prior to 1920
(Trewartha, 1965), and the Bureau of
Statistics has stated in its official reports
that infant deaths were so incompletely
recorded as late as 1913 as to be valueless
for historical study (Logan, 1954). The
first census in Japan was in 1920. Mexico
has good documentation since 1895, when
its first census was taken (except for the
period of revolution, 1911-21). Birth registration was only 70-75% complete until
1929, Death registration was almost complete in the period 1895-1910 and gradually
improved from about 90% in 1921 to almost
complete in 1940, when birth and death
registrations were equal in relative completeness (Collver, 1965).

Collyer (1965) demonstrated the inaccuracies of the Mexican birth statistics. He
specifically showed the suspect nature of

the 1910-21 (revolutionary period) information. There were problems with the
censuses and registrations between 1895
and 1930 which had to be balanced to
obtain more accurate vital statistics. His
primary method was to minimally correct
the census information and to modify the
births and deaths to fit the population sizes
and distributions.? Collver’s estimated birth
rates have been utilized in this research.
His estimates of completeness of registration (with modifications from Arriaga’s
work) (Arriaga, 1967a, 1970) were ulilized to correct the Industrial-Urban status
statistics for 1921 and 1930 (1940-+ birth
statistics were shown to be relatively complete and were not further corrected; his
estimates differed little from official statistics for 1940-+-).

Arriaga (196765, 1970) performed a
unique analysis of death statistics for Latin
American countries, including Mexico. His
derived life tables (1968) are a relatively
accurate series for Latin America. Arriaga
(19676) derived and presented the differences in death registration between urban
and rural areas in Mexico. He showed that
low rural registration is a function of the
density of registration places and the density of roads in areas. Rural death rates
upon correction were greater than urban
death rates through 1961 in Mexico, and
were much more variable between areas.

Utilizing Arriaga’s corrections for registration and Collver’s birth rates, Arriaga
computed corrected rates for 1921 and
thereafter, which he utilized in constructing his life tables. His correction factors®
and resulting corrected rates (Arriaga, 1968,
1970) have been utilized in this research.
Arriaga provided rates of natural increase
for 1895-1910, death rates for 1921+, and

2 An alternate method used by Collver (1965)
also produced similar birth rates.

differential under-registration.

under-registration percentages for 1921-}(including urban-rural differences).

In computing new life tables (from
whence revised populations and rates came),
Arriaga attempted to account for migration.
Mexico had major migrations in the period
considered, both to and from the United
States and to the urban communities. There
are few statistics on migration prior to
1942. Arriaga has stated: “It is very difficult to determine the extent to which international migration has affected the Mexican
population. Statistics on migration are not
reliable” (Arriaga, 1968, p. 184). Nevertheless, he derived estimates for use in the
life tables for the large out-movement during 1920-30, the large in-movement during
1930-40, and some out-movement during
1940-60. These movements affected the
younger age groups specifically, and thus
affected vital statistics. Changes due to migration were thus accounted for. In Japan,
international migration (in or out) was
examined by Taueber (1958), but was not
used to adjust vital statistics. Emigration
in Mexico had little effect on rates, but
immigration could lower the rates slightly.
Rural to urban migration predominantly
raises the urban rates, at least temporarily
until the new migrants adjusted their rates
to those of the urban residents. A similar
statement of effect could be made for Japanese migration although it was noticeably
less. The effect of migration, therefore, on
the vital rates utilized in this study (even
though accounted for somewhat) is a slight
increase in urban rates and thus a very
slight understatement of industrial-urban
group differences. This is true especially in
Mexico, where the differences are more
urban-rural differences than industrialnonindustrial differences. Even in Mexico,
however, there is a separate industrial component which plays a role in the differentials. In Japan, the industrial-nonindustrial
dimension is just as important as the urban
Social Biology

rural dimension in the stratification, especially after 1920.

Because of the obvious errors in all statistics prior to 1921 (Arriaga, 19675, 1970;
Collver, 1965), I-U strata rates were not
computed prior to 1921. The 1921 statistics, though used, must be interpreted with
caution. Statistics used herein for Japan
and Mexico are drawn from the vital statistics sources for those countries (Instituto
Mexicano de Recursos Naturales Renovables, 1960; Japan, Prime Minister’s Office
Bureau of Statistics, 1915, 1952; Mexico
Direcci6n General de Estadistica, 1897,
1902, 1924, 1939, 1941a, 19415, 1943,
1947, 1950, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1962; United
Nations, 1954, 1963a, 1965) unless otherwise noted.

Using the variable “per cent of gainfully
occupied in agriculture,” Taueber (1958)
ordered the prefectures in Japan into industrial types, using the 1930 census. These
types are considered here to approximate
industrial-urban strata in an_ ecological
manner. These groups are generally homogeneous within themselves and heterogeneous amongst themselves on a number of
basic measures (such as income). They
represent almost perfectly the per cent
urban and the per cent in industry. The
groups formed thus represent an industrialurban hierarchy. The numerous states of
Mexico have been ordered on the same
basis, utilizing the same variable, using the
1950 census (Mexico Direccién General de
Estadistica, 1954). The latter date has
been chosen so as to be closest to the 1930
data for Japan; in 1930, Japan’s percentage
was 57% versus 48% for Mexico in 1950.
The relative Industrial-Urban (I-U) status
of the prefectures/states within each country over time is fairly constant.4

4For example, the Spearman Rho correlation
for Mexico’s states between 1940 and 1950 when
ranked on the criteria is 0.961, and no state
switches groups. This finding remains fairly constant over the time period considered.

The classification criteria used here for
industrial-urban stratification is the percentage of the gainfully occupied population
in Agriculture and Forestry (Taueber,
1958), as follows: I (high), under 20%;
II, 20-39% III, 40-49%; IV, 50-59%;
V (low), 60%-+. The distributions of
prefectures/states by classification criteria
are shown in Table 1.

order to evaluate the differentials between
Strata in natality and mortality, certain
indices were derived to represent these
differentials between groups for each country for each year considered. One such
index was the actual difference between
the natality or mortality rate of Group I
and that of Group V, expressed in absolute
terms (|D]). It is used to measure absolute

The relationship of urbanization and
industrialization has been examined for
Japan and Mexico. In Japan, the relationship is very high (Taueber, 1958). Thus,
in 1930, the proportion in agriculture and
forestry (in the labor force) is only 27%
in urban areas of 5,000 or more (and 73%
in rural areas), and the proportion in
manufacturing (in the labor force) is directly related to the proportion urban
(Taueber, 1958). In Mexico, in 1950, the
proportion urban (2,500 or more) has a
calculated correlation of —0.87 with the
per cent of the labor force in agriculture/
forestry.

COMPUTATIONS

The birth rates and death rates for this
analysis were computed for each industrialurban group for each country over the time
period considered. High industrial-urban
strata prefectures/states represent Group I
(high I-U status), low industrial-urban
strata represent Group V (low J-U status).
Groups I and V were the ones primarily
used. Other groups generally fell between
these two and are not used separately. In

change. A |D| value of 0 means the rates
are equal. The rates used (for a specific
country in a specific year) were the crude
death rate, the crude birth rate, the infant
mortality rate, and the rate of natural increase.

It is the general hypothesis of this paper
that the mortality and natality trends can
be shown to interact, the former preceding
and affecting the latter, but that this interaction is also reflected in the differentials
between I-U strata in the ratio and their
trends. These differentials will reflect urbanrural differences in the beginning and both
urban and industrial effects with time.
Thus, from previous knowledge, it is hypothesized that the mortality decline occurs
(I). Second, the same decline occurs in the
first, starting in the high I-U status group
low 1-U status group (V), thus reducing
the status group differential (absolute difference |D| decreasing). Third, the beginning of the decline in natality is seen in
the high I-U status group (I). In the
fourth instance, one expects the low I-U
status group (V) natality first to increase,
because of the positive effects of reduced

mortality on fertility (Arriaga, 1967a).
This group will then start their natality
decline, thus reducing the status group
differential for that rate (decrease in |D|).
From what is expected, the behavior of the
rates can be examined and compared.

The results obtained in this study are
applicable to the groups (subpopulations)
under study. They do not explain individual
behavior, nor do they correspond exactly
to the results of any studies where individuals were studied rather than groups.
Ecological and individual studies differ in
methodology and often in results (Lebowitz, 1962; Rogers, Yamamoto, and Messinger, 1966; Duncan and Davis, 1953).

RESULTS

Trewartha (1965) has indicated, for
Japan between 1868-1940, that as industrialization and urbanization increased,
birth and death rates decreased. In Japan,
both death and birth rates have declined
since 1920 for all occupational-social classes
(Taueber, 1958). The declines in the death
rates occurred first in the higher class
(Logan, 1954); this group previously had
higher rates than those in the lower status
group, primarily due to urban residence.
The declines in the birth rates proceeded
in the same manner, but after the death
rate declines (Taueber, 1958). In Mexico,
the death rate declines proceeded as in
Japan, and the declines became rapid as
modern technology made large gains against
the very high mortality. However, birth
rates first increased with decreasing mortality (Arriaga, 1970). In Mexico, as the
per cent of males in the labor force in
nonagricultural occupations increased during 1921-60 from 24% to 41%, and as
the per cent urban increased in that period,
the age-sex standardized birth rate actually
increased from 41/1000 to 49/1000. Some
decrease is thought to have occurred since
1960.

Social Biology

In both countries, the death rate declined in the high strata as public health
practices were introduced, first into the
cities where most of these people lived.
In the post-war period, there was an increase in the number of diseases which
could be controlled without necessitating
large changes in the resource situation,
levels of income, or ways of living. Differences in mortality in various geographical
areas and classes may have then widened
somewhat in the process, but the rapid
declines in natural mortality and the patterns of decline show a movement of all
groups within the nation toward low mortality (Taueber, 1958). In 1964, the crude
death rate of Japan was 6.9 per 1000, and
in Mexico for the same year it was 9.8
(United Nations, 1965). These and other
trends are shown in the data below, and
expounded so that further ramifications
may be highlighted.

It can be seen from Table 2 that the
Japanese infant mortality rate and the
Mexican death rate decline over time (as
does the Japanese death rate, not illustrated: 18.2/1000 in 1930 to 7.6/1000 in
1960). The birth rate in Japan also decreases with time; but the birth rate in
Mexico actually increases until 1950, when
it begins to decrease slightly. In Japan,
Taueber also showed the high fertility
groups decreased more than the lower
fertility groups between 1925 and 1947
(Taueber, 1958).5

All differences in the birth and death
rates of the high and low I-U strata (|D})
decrease over the periods considered. The
differences in Mexico appear not to decline
until 1930 and later. The trends, however,
show various fluctuations with time.

5 The correlations between the number of female
births per 1,000 females in specific age groups by
prefecture for 1925 and the decline in this rate
between 1925 and 1947 by prefecture were all
significant, ranging from 0.24 (ages 15-19) and
to 0.97 (ages 15-19 and 45-49).

When the Japanese data on expectation

trend in the difference between Group V
and Group I is strictly downward, as the
expectation for both groups increases dramatically (Table 3).

to decreases in both birth and death rates,
first in the high I-U stratum and then in

Let us now examine the interaction between the birth rate and the death rate for
each country. To begin with, the rate of
natural increase, as shown in Table 4,
decreases for Japan but increases for
Mexico over the periods considered. In
Japan and Mexico, the absolute difference
in the rate between the high and low I-U
strata decreases over the time period. The
ratio of the low to high I-U strata rates
and low strata to total rate shows the same

the low I-U stratum. In Mexico, the death
rate changes dramatically (while the birth
rate essentially does not change) first in
the high I-U stratum and then in the low
I-U stratum. Thus, the natural increase
rate increases in general and in high and
low strata, while the differential decreases.

In Mexico, the rate of natural increase
(NIR) is always higher for stratum V
(low I-U). The changes in stratum V
parallel those of stratum I (high I-U)
but come closer in rate with time. The
absolute differences between NIR’s of
strata I and V decrease after 1930 (1930,
1940, 1950). The V/I ratio decreases
from 1921 to 1950 (200 to 118). Fluctuations of NIR in time was due to various
factors. The increase in NIR between 1920
and 1930 appears to be due to a decrease
in death rate in stratum J and a birth rate
increase in V. In both strata, the decrease
in NIR between 1930 and 1940 appears
to be due to a decrease in the birth rate
faster than the death rate decrease. Between 1940 and 1950, in both strata, the
birth rate increased and the death rate
decreased.

In Japan, it was primarily in the high
I-U stratum that the decrease of the NIR
occurred, which led to the convergence of
the group rates. In Mexico, it appears that
the high I-U stratum rate, though increasing, increased less than that of the low
stratum group.

Finally, an early widening of the difference between strata appears, which then
appears to decrease. The widening in Japan
is due to the widening of the infant mortality rate differential between strata. In
addition, the lag of the birth rate changes
following death rate changes, as seen in
Table 2, conform to our expectations. In
Mexico, it appears related to the larger
birth rate differential between strata.

 

 

Social Biology

In Japan, mortality decreased rapidly
for both groups, the more so for the high
status group, which is first highest. The
decrease in the birth rate was similar in
both groups, although it appeared to be
more accelerated in the higher group in
the beginning. It is also known that the
number of female births per thousand
females in specific age groups in perfectures
of 1925 correlated highly with the decline
in the number between 1925 and 1947
(Taueber, 1958), which means that in this
period the higher fertility groups declined
faster once decline started. With the
knowledge that natality was by then greater
for the low status groups, the decrease
in the differential is comprehensible and
is in accordance with the general trend.

In Mexico, the trend illustrates the sharp
decrease in mortality starting in the high
stratum, and the accelerating decrease in
natality in the high stratum, which then
rises slightly. Natality in the low stratum
varied in the period while there was a
decrease in mortality.

Changes in the age structures of these
groups occur with the changes in the interaction of mortality and natality and is now
a well-known phenomenon (Coale, 1957;
Keyfitz and Murphy, 1964; Valoris, 1949).
In the extremes, under high natality and
low mortality, one expects the highest proportion to be in the 0-14 age group and
the lowest proportion to be in the 50-+ age
group. Under medium to low natality and
mortality, the reverse is expected. In Japan,
the per cent dependent (under 15 and 65+)
decreased after 1930 to 38.6% in 1955, In
Mexico, the per cent dependent increases
after 1920 up to 46.5% in 1960.

The structure of the population then
changes in each group as natality and
mortality interact along the general trend
discussed.

DISCUSSION

The industrial-urban typology, utilizing
the proportion employed in agriculture,
does differentiate the groups of high industrialization and urbanization from those
of low I-U. Over time, these groups remain
fairly constant, with little to no shift of a
prefecture or state from one stratum to
another. In addition, relative urbanization
remains similar, with the high I-U strata
still highly urban and low I-U strata still
highly rural. However, differences found
are not due only to the urban proportions
within groups, since middle status groups,
with some mix of urban characteristics,
show the same relationships.

The major differences in levels and trends
of mortality and natality between Japan
and Mexico are probably due to Japan’s
advanced “modernization.” That is, Japan
has industrialized and become urbanized
far more rapidly than Mexico. Japan continues to have more people living in large
cities. In 1950 the per cent in urban areas
of one million or more was 54% in Japan
versus 13.3% in Mexico (Browning, unpublished; Trewartha, 1965), and a larger
proportion was occupied outside of agriculture (54.7% in Japan versus 42.9% in
Mexico).

These differences, and the fact of modernization, also reflect the differences in
health facilities and their availability in
the two countries. Thus, the proportion
of physicians to the total population in
1960 was about 0.05% in Mexico compared to 1.4% in Japan (U.S. Bureau of
the Census, 1963). The availability of
medical treatment to the lower strata has
increased greatly in Latin America, but is
still very disproportionate to their need,
especially in the more rural areas (Roemer,
1964). Although the death rates and the
differentials have declined in Mexico, the

Birth and Death Rates

99

expectation of life at birth is still about
ten years lower than in Japan; in the period
1955-59, it was 55-59 for Mexico and
65-69 for Japan (United Nations, 1963a).

As of 1960, Mexico lagged behind Japan
in most measures. It was about 12 years
behind in mortality rates, 35 years behind
in urbanization, and 20 years behind in
reductions in the proportion in agriculture.
The differences between the two countries
in fertility and in the dependency ratios
were actually increasing still in 1960.

It is interesting to note that Hungary, a
country inbetween Japan and Mexico in
industrialization and urbanization, shows
the same decline in the occupation differential with the decline in mortality (Instituto
Mexicano de Recursos Naturales Renovables, 1960) (see Figure 2). It may be
concluded that, in general, when a country’s
mortality rate declines, the IndustrialUrban (and occupational) differentials in
mortality likewise decline.

These two countries are going through
changes much more rapidly than did the
developing countries. Japan’s transition is
similar, however, to the general model.
Mexico’s is not, due to the rapid mortality
decline and the increase and leveling off
in natality. Mortality declines in both countries were much more related to medical
technology than the declines experienced
in the developed countries. In fact, the
decline has occurred in Mexico without
major changes in living conditions. Both
countries experienced much more rapid
urbanization also, with the trend continuing in Mexico. Fertility has yet to decline
in Mexico, even with the mortality decline,
urbanization, some industrialization, and
some improvements in per capita income.
It is, therefore, difficult to predict the
demographic transition in Mexico, but it
appears different than that which occurred
in the West.
