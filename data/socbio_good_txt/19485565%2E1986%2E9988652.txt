Program of Research Grants for 1987

The Lalor Foundation provides
grants to institutions for basic postdoctoral research in mammalian reproductive physiology and biochemistry for
yielding improved methods of contraception, termination of pregnancy, and/
or sterilization. The purpose of these
grants is to promote intensive research
in the areas indicated and to assist and
encourage able young investigators in
academic positions to follow research
careers in mammalian reproductive
physiology.

The individual nominated by the applicant institution for the postdoctoral
fellowship for conduct of the work may
be a citizen of any country and should
have training and experience at least
equal to the Ph.D. or M.D. level. Younger people are preferred, and the upper
age limit is 35 years. One such nomination is to be made for each project applied for.

The applicant institution may make
its nomination of a fellow from among

its own personnel or elsewhere, with
candidates from other than the proposing institution carrying a modest preference. The institution’s nominee for fellowship must be named at the time of
the project application and performance
record incorporated therein.

Grants may range up to $20,000 per
year for coverage of fellowship stipend,
institutional overhead, laboratory and
miscellaneous expenses, and as need
may indicate, proportionately less for
shorter time grants. Renewal is possible
under special circumstances.

Official application materials are
available from the Director, Lalor
Foundation, 3801 Kennett Pike, Building B-108, Wilmington, Delaware
19807. Final date for receipt from applicant institution of executed Application
Form, complete with supporting data, is
January 15, 1987. Notification regarding
appointments may be expected by
March 15, 1987.
