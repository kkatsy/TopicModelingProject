Births and Cohort Size

ABSTRACT: Ahlburg (1983, 1986) tested a simple version of Easterlin’s relative-cohort-size
model of fertility on the basis of U.S. and Canadian post-war data. His conclusion was that the
Easterlin model fits the data very well and can therefore be used for calculating forecasts.
However, the model he estimated is oversimplified. In this paper an alternative specification is
presented. The model is applied to Dutch fertility data. The Easterlin effect is found to affect the
movement of births in the Netherlands during the period 1950-85, but a declining long-term
trend in average family size proves far more important in explaining post-war births. The model

forecasts a rise of births until 2000.

Easterlin (1961, 1973, 1976) postulates that fertility is determined by relative income, i.e., by the ratio of income
of families in the childbearing ages to
their expected income. The latter depends on the standard of living their parents enjoyed when they were reared. If
it is assumed that small generations perform better on the labor market and
earn higher incomes than large generations, relative income is determined by
relative cohort size. Consequently fertility is related to cohort size.

This model may be attractive to population forecasters as it implies that future births are a function of past births.
Hence, if the model is valid, births can
be forecast without it being necessary to
forecast explanatory variables first.

Ahlburg (1983, 1986) applies a simple version of this model to U.S. and Canadian live births. This paper argues
that his specification is oversimplified
and presents an alternative specification
which is applied to Dutch fertility data.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

AHLBURG’S TEST OF
SAMUELSON’S MODEL

Ahlburg (1983) estimates the
relative-cohort-size model for U.S. total
live births in the period 1949 to 1978.
Ahlburg (1986) applies the same model
to Canadian data for the period 1941 to
1979. In both cases Ahlburg concludes
that the model fits the data very well.
Assuming the model to be valid, he calculates long-term forecasts of births.

There is, however, reason to doubt
the validity of Ahlburg’s specification.
Hence his “‘satisfactory’’ empirical
results do not necessarily support Easterlin’s theory. As Ahlburg notes, his
model is based on a specification by
Samuelson (1976). However, Samuelson (p. 244) points out that his specification is an ‘‘oversimplified version”’
of the Easterlin theory. He does not
aim to describe actual developments:
“the formulation is illustrative only.”

The specification used by Ahlburg
boils down to the assumption that all
children of women of a given generation
are born in the same year. It goes without saying that this model is oversimplified.

Ahlburg (1983) distinguishes two age
groups: N,{(t), the number of persons in
the prime childbearing stage of life;
N,(t), the number of those some twenty
years older who are in the last years of
childbearing. Using Ahlburg’s notation,
we write the model as follows:

Bit) = fiNi() + N24
= fipiB(t-1) + fapip2B(t-2), (1)

where fi, f2 are age-specific fertility
rates; Pi, P2 are fractions of survivors;
B(t) is the number of births in period t.
Easterlin’s model is specified as

fi =h(RY) (2)
RY =k(N,/N)) (3)

with f; an inclining function of RY and
RY a declining function of N,/N2, where
RY 1s relative income. Substitution of
(2) and (3) in (1) gives

B(t) = pifilpB(t-1)/pip2B(t-2)]
B(t-1) + fopip2B(t-2)
= a,[B(t-1)/B(t-2)]B(t-1) +
a,B(t-2). (4)

Subsequently Ahlburg specifies the
equation to be estimated as

B, = a,B34/Bi2 + arB,2 + C15 (5)

where é; is a random disturbance term.
This specification implies that Ahlburg
implicitly assumes a linear relationship
between f; and Ni/N2. However, as fertility rates cannot be negative, a term
such as aoB,, is lacking. Moreover, in
presenting the estimation results,
Ahlburg introduces a constant term
from nowhere.

Brief Reports 147

From the estimation results presented in Ahlburg (1983), it appears that
B, is the total number of live births in a
single year. The lag f-1 is twenty years
and t-2 is forty years. Thus, according to
Model (5), total births in year ¢ only depend on total births 20 and 40 years before. Not very surprisingly, Ahlburg
finds that the model generates a cycle of
40 years. Finally, it should be noted that
Ahlburg ignores changes in the timing of
fertility.

In view of these remarks, it can be
questioned whether the estimated values of the coefficients of (5) provide any
information at all with respect to the validity of the Easterlin hypothesis.

ALTERNATIVE SPECIFICATION

On the basis of more realistic assumptions, an alternative specification
can be derived. The number of births in
a given year can be related to past births
by

B, = Dfit Bri qi, (6)

where B, = number of births in year 1;
fi: = age-specific fertility rate for age iin
year f;

dit = Vri Pits (7)

where v;; = fraction of births in ¢-i of female sex; p;, = fraction of women born
in (t-i) surviving after i years. As the external migration surplus in the Netherlands was relatively small compared to
births during the examined period, it is
not included in the model.

The age-specific fertility rates in a
given year are determined by two factors, completed fertility of cohorts and
its timing:

fit = Lilrii, (8)
where J,; = completed fertility of

148 Brief Reports

women born in t-i; L,;; = fraction of total fertility of those women at age i.
Completed fertility of women born in ¢-i
can be distinguished according to the
age of their mothers:

Li = 2Kej jleij, (9)

where K,, ; = fraction of women born in
t-i whose mothers were born in t-i-/;
I,.,; = completed fertility of women
born in t-1 whose mothers were born in
t-1-],

The Easterlin theory assumes that
completed fertility of a given cohort is
inversely related to the ratio of the size
of that cohort to that of their parents. If,
in addition, it is assumed that societal
developments such as secularization, urbanization, and emancipation lead to a
declining long-run trend of the fertility

level that is independent of relative co
hort size, the following specification
results:

Lei j =a B, il Brij ss ds¥s(t-i), (10)

where the long-run trend is described by
a polynomial with coefficients y,. The
Easterlin hypothesis implies that a <0.
A falling linear trend is described by
yo > Oand y; <0.

Substitution of (8), (9) and (10) in (6)
yields

B, = B; di [B?,.i Lisi (2; Ky, ;/ B,i3)| +
Dre (8,2; {(t-i)°B,.j Lidl, (i 1)

where B; = ag and 6, = y,g. As both
the sex ratio at birth and the mortality
quotients at younger ages hardly vary,
git is assumed constant: q;, = qg. Since

Kyi; = fp 2iBrijq/ Bri, (12)
(11) can be rewritten as
B, = B di (Bil, i TF Rei) +
Xs [8,2i(t-1)°B,i Li], (13)

where TFR,i = 2ifj-iand B = Big.

Social Biology

Given this specification, testing the
Easterlin hypothesis amounts to answering the question whether the coefficient B is negative.

ASSUMPTIONS

Model (13) is estimated for the period 1950~85 on the basis of Dutch data.
As the minimum and maximum childbearing ages determine the time lags in
the model and hence the length of the
estimation period, the analysis is restricted to fertility between ages 20
and 35.

Data for the total fertility rate (TFR)
are available from 1936 onward. However, figures since 1915 are needed. Estimates for the period 1915-35 are obtained by dividing total births into
five-years age groups of the mother
based on the age-specific data of 1936.
These numbers of births are subsequently related to the numbers of
women in the various age categories.
The sensitivity of the empirical results to
this procedure will be discussed below.
As total fertility at age 35 is not yet observed for women born after 1950, it is
not yet known to which fractions of total
fertility the already observed agespecific fertility rates of these women
correspond. Estimates are obtained
from the National Population Forecasts
of 1986 of the Netherlands Central Bureau of Statistics. The sensitivity of the
results to this choice will be examined
below.

For describing the long-run trend in
family size, we use a linear function. The
effect on the outcomes of choosing another specification will be discussed. If
the residuals exhibit autocorrelation, an
ARMA-model for the disturbance term
is specified. The coefficients of this
model are estimated simultaneously
with the other coefficients.

model clearly improves, especially in recent years. The adjusted correlation
coefficients are 0.982 and 0.986 respectively. The coefficient representing the
Easterlin effect is hardly affected. A
problem in using polynomials of higher
degree is, however, that they tend to extreme out-of-sample projections.

Another possibility for describing the
trend is to use a linear spline function.
This implies that the examined period is
divided into subperiods to which linear
trends with different slopes apply. The

slope of the trend in completed fertility
of cohorts after 1945 differs from that of

The residuals do not exhibit autocorrelation. Without the Easterlin effect, the

0.86. If, instead of cohort 1945, a later
cohort is selected as turning point, the fit
of the model deteriorates slightly. The
projections show an increase of total
births until 2000. In the absence of the
Easterlin effect, the model forecasts a
stabilization of births until the mid
1990’s, after which a decline follows. In

calculating the forecasts, information on
the timing pattern of fertility of recent
cohorts is obtained from the National
Population Forecasts of 1986. According to this forecast there is a shift in fertility from young ages to ages around
thirty. If, instead, one would assume
that the timing pattern of fertility after
birth cohort 1955 does not change,
which implies that the observed decline
of fertility at young ages would not be
caught up in later years, total births
would only rise to a level of 192,000 in
the year 2000.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

Estimation of the model for the period 1950-85 requires an assumption on
the movement of the TFR in the period
1915-35. In order to examine how sensitive the outcomes are to this assumption, we make an alternative estimate of
the TFR on the basis of the ratio of the
TFR to total births. This ratio changes
gradually through time. The movement
of this ratio in the period 1936-62 can be
described reasonably accurately by a linear trend (R? = 0.96). Extrapolation of
this trend back to 1915 yields an alternative estimate of the TFR which is considerably lower than the estimate discussed
before. Nevertheless, using this alternative estimate does not cause the outcomes to change strongly. The fit of the
model stays the same: R? = 0.983. The
estimated value of B becomes —0.3430
(with standard error 0.0238).

Another assumption concerns the
timing of fertility of recent cohorts. In
 

Social Biology

stead of using outcomes of the National
Population Forecasts of 1986, we can assume that the timing pattern of fertility
does not change after birth cohort 1955.
In that case the estimated value of B becomes —0.2330 (with standard error
0.0155).

Thus, the conclusion that the Easterlin hypothesis is not rejected by the
data is not particularly sensitive to the
assumptions underlying the estimation
of the model.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

Under the assumption that the
change of completed fertility of successive cohorts is determined by a combination of a linear trend and relative cohort
size (the Easterlin effect), the movement of total births in the Netherlands in
the period 1950-85 can be described
reasonably accurately. The long-run
trend plays by far the more important
role, but the Easterlin effect increases
the explanatory power of the model.

The Easteriin hypothesis cannot be
rejected on the basis of the specification
used in this paper. However, this is not
tantamount to saying that the Easterlin
theory is true, as only one possible specification at an aggregate level is tested for
a limited period of time.
