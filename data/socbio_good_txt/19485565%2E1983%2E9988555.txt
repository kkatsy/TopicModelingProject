Brief Reports

Tracing the Brain Drain
With Reprint Requests

Wilson I. B. Onuigbo

Enugu, Nigeria

The brain drain, or the migration of
trained manpower from one country to
S another, is an important phenomenon
‘= in social biology. Discussing this probS lem, Gwee (1973) exemplified with In« dia as follows: “A crash programme in
° .
> education would help to solve the prob% lem of shortage of brain power far better
>, than most of the ineffectual efforts to re5 duce brain drain. An objection to this is
>, the possibility of creating such an excess
of trained persons that there is no way to
utilize them, and a greater brain drain
will result. This has in fact happened in
India... .”

Inhaber (1975) dealt exclusively with
India in his own contribution to this
journal when evaluating the significance
of the brain drain on developing countries. He used a relatively standardized
method by compiling the numbers of Indian scientists publishing in the major
technical journals of the world with reference to their residence in the host or
home country. In particular, he employed 43 groups of common Indian
names in tabular form to demonstrate

that “‘a significant proportion of the
stock of Indian scientists was lost from
1967 to 1972, primarily to economically
advanced countries.”

The object of this paper is to study
the brain drain from India by using the
tabulated 43 common Indian names
with another method for obtaining a
standardized count. Elsewhere (Onuigbo, 1982), I have presented the novel
method of counting reprint requests

‘containing printing errors in order to

gain some insight into communication
processes. Here, let me provide total
counts of the reprint requests which I received personally from Indian researchers resident at home or abroad.

During the decade from 1970 to 1979
inclusive, I published 44 papers on cancer as regards anatomical dissemination
(18), geographical distribution (14), and
historical disquisition (12). These papers appeared mostly in the United
States and United Kingdom but were
also purposely published in diverse
countries, namely, Australia, Canada,
Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Germany,

India, Ireland, Japan, Nigeria, Poland,
and Switzerland. The publications
yielded a total of 1,806 reprint requests
from workers in numerous countries.
These requests have been analyzed using the published 43 uniquely Indian
names in order to distinguish between
home-based and foreign-based researchers.

Table 1 shows that 14 of the listed
names are represented in my collection.
For a total of 29 requests, only 2 came
from India itself, the rest being from the
following host countries: United States,
17; Canada, 8; United Kingdom, 1; and
Japan,1.

Of interest was the fact that there
were in many cases no data to indicate
whether the requester was permanently
or temporarily domiciled in the foreign
country. However, one researcher gave
his status as Professor of Genetics and
another as Chief of the Surgical Service.
A third worker based in Canada made

six separate requests over a period of
years, indicating thereby a degree of
permanency in consonance with the
brain drain phenomenon.

It should be mentioned that I received four other requests from domiciles of India which bore certain unlisted
names: Kothari, Laumas, Mathan, and
Sopory. Accordingly, such scientists
bearing the less common Indian names
are also likely to be numerous among
those who requested my reprints from
outside their home country. The probability, therefore, is that much larger series will throw optimum light on the full
spectrum of the brain drain from India.
Of course, such series should embrace
diverse fields of research.

The element of clustering, which is
noteworthy in science (Frame et al.,
1977), was found in this study. Thus, of
the 6 requests from India, as many as 4
were from New Delhi, notably 3 from
the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and 1 from the Jawaharlal Nehru
University. Similarly, of the 17 requests
emanating from the United States, only
7 of the 50 states were represented,
namely, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland,
Minnesota, New York, Texas and Virginia.

Hence, reprint requests should not
be regarded by Todd (1977), Dirckx
(1981), and others as an unworthy
“game.” As I see it, each request performs what may be called a “tracer function.”’ Thus, with collected requests, I
was able to trace the bibliographic role
of Current Contents in information science (Onuigbo, 1982). Likewise, in the
present study, these requests have been
used to trace cancer researchers whose
domiciliary attributes were consonant
with the occurrence of brain drain from
India to some developed countries.

common use include Science Citation Index (Hagstrom, 1974), MEDLARS
(Harley, 1975) and Who is Publishing in
Science (Inhaber, 1977). I am persuaded
that the hitherto lowly reprint request
could become a serious research tool in
this field. For instance, Welsby (1978)
studied the 155 reprint requests which
he received after publishing on a general
medical topic and found that 54 per cent
came from the United States and that 95
per cent were derived from Current
Contents. I obtained 53 per cent and 85
per cent respectively from only 87 requests (Onuigbo, 1982). How much
more fruitfully representative would be
the requests that run to several thousands!

In conclusion, analysis of reprint requests received personally from India
and elsewhere confirmed the occurrence of brain drain from that country to
some developed countries of the world.
Consequently, it is suggested that reprint requests can perform what may be

called a tracer function in the social
study of science. In all probability, if this
function is studied on a serious scale, it
may blossom out into a mode} system in
scientometrics.
