Urban and Rural Fertility in Bangladesh:

A Causal Approach

ABSTRACT: Fertility models are constructed from the 1989 Bangladesh Fertility Survey (BFS)
employing path analysis. These models are developed and interpreted for urban and rural
situations. As a proxy for fertility, the number of children ever born is used, and age, religion,
age at marriage, parental childhood residence, and education are considered as explanatory
variables. The contribution that these variables give to explaining the 1989 Bangladeshi fertility
is compared to the explanatory variables that Ahmed (1981) found suitable for Bangladeshi
fertility in 1975. We find that in 1989, compared to 1975, childhood background and education
of the mother and age at marriage exert a greater influence on urban fertility, and religion no
longer has a significant effect. In the rural case, the effect of religion on fertility has increased
since 1975, as has education and age at marriage.

Bangladesh is one of the most
densely populated and poorest countries in the world. As such, Bangladesh
has been the subject of much demographic enquiry (see, for example,
Chen and Chaudhury, 1975; Curlin et
al., 1976; Arthur and McNicoll, 1978;
Cain, 1977, 1978, 1986; Ahmed, 1981;
Cleland and Mauldin, 1991; Cleland
et al., 1992; Caldwell and Caldwell,
1992). Of particular interest is the
modeling of fertility, primarily with a
view to identifying mechanisms to reduce population growth and enhance
living standards.

The total fertility rate has declined
from about 7 in 1975 to about 5 in 1988,
equivalent to a 30 per cent drop (Cleland et al., 1992; Caldwell and Caldwell, 1992). Reasons for this decline
are attributed to increased urbanization, enhanced education, increasing
use of contraception, and increased
age at marriage (Kabir and Rob, 1990;
Islam and Khan, 1992; Cleland et al.,

1992; Caldwell and Caldwell, 1992).
However, how these factors influence
fertility is complex, and studies suggest
that the factors themselves often act
upon one another in a complex milieu.
Fertility of urban women is generally
found to be lower than that of their rural counterparts. This fertility difference has been confirmed in Bangladesh
by Ahmed (1981) and Cleland et al.
(1992), in Thailand by Goldstein
(1973), and in Taiwan by Freedman et
al. (1972). However, Omran (1973)
found the converse in the case of
Egypt.

Advances in understanding Bangladeshi fertility have been made using
the data from the 1975 Bangladesh
Fertility Survey (BFS), notably in the
work of Ahmed (1981) and of Lee and
Amin (1981), and also using other data
sources as have Islam and Khan (1991,

1992) and Rob and Kabir (1988).

These researchers applied path analysis to map out the web of influences of

socioeconomic and demographic variables on fertility. The aim of this paper
is to add to these studies of urban and
rural fertility determinants in Bangladesh by presenting an analysis of the
most recent data set constructed from
the 1989 Bangladesh Fertility Survey
and by comparing the findings to those
of Ahmed (1981). °

First we give a short account of the
data sources and then our analysis of
the 1989 BFS. We discuss the differences that have occurred over the
fourteen-year period between 1975
and 1989. Finally, we conclude with a
discussion of the findings and suggestions for future modeling.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA

The data used in this study were obtained from the 1989 Bangladesh Fertility Survey which was conducted by
the National Institute of Population
Research and Training (NIPORT). A
total of 11,905 ever-married women, of
whom 8,466 were from rural areas
and 3,439 were from urban areas, were
interviewed, resulting in an _ oversampling of urban mothers. In order to
obtain the national estimates, appropriate weights have been assigned. Details of the survey are found in Huq
and Cleland (1990). Findings from this
data set are compared with those of
Ahmed’s (1981) study which used the
1975 BFS. In the 1975 survey, 5,024 rural women and 1,489 urban women
were interviewed (GOB, 1978).

ANALYSIS OF THE 1989 BFS

Path analysis was used to determine
how variables such as age, religion,

Urban and Rural Fertility

241

childhood place of residence, and educational background influence one
another and conspire to affect the
number of children ever born, which is
taken as pseudonym for fertility. Path
analysis is a popular method in the social sciences for modeling linear relationships between interrelated variables (see, for example, Duncan, 1966;
Loebner and Driver, 1973; Shin, 1977;
Roy, 1981; Islam and Khan, 1991).
The degree of influence of each vari-—
able upon another is indicated by the
path coefficient P;; which is a standardized regression coefficient expressed as
follows:

7
Py= bys.

where b,,is the regression coefficient of
the i‘ variable on the j*# variable and 8
is the standard deviation. The path coefficients can be arrived at from expansion of the correlation coefficients as in
the relationship:

r= > yqPial ia

where i and j are the two variables and
g is an index for all the variables which
have paths leading directly into the
variable i and r;;, is the correlation coefficient between variables i and j.

The unexplained portion of the
variance which is due to unmeasured
extraneous variables is given by the residual path coefficient. The determination of the terms in path analysis is fully
explained in Halli and Rao (1992).

The variables chosen for inclusion in.
the modeling are displayed in Table 1.
The choice of these variables can be
justified as follows:

AGE-—Studies reveal that current
age of mother has the highest association with fertility (Henripin, 1972;

Age at marriage of women............. AMW Completed years
Children ever born (Fertility) .......... CEB Exact Number of Live Births

Namboodiri, 1974; Krishnan and
Krotki, 1976). Thus, one could expect
AGE to be positively associated with
CEB. One hypothesis is that, due to
modernization, the younger portion of
women are getting more facilities than
the old, and therefore it could be expected that AGE is negatively related
to EDW and AMW.

REL—Religion is widely used as a
cultural variable because it influences
people’s values, beliefs, and practice.
Earlier studies show that Muslims have
been found to have higher fertility than
non-Muslims (Kirk, 1966; Mazur,
1967; Loebner and Driver, 1973; Islam
and Khan, 1991; Khan et al., 1993).
This higher fertility is partly a result of
the early age at marriage observed in
Muslims (Chaudhury, 1984; Islam and
Khan, 1992). From this early marriage
age, it may be hypothesized that Muslim women have received less education compared to their non-Muslim
counterparts.

CBW—Childhood background of
women is important in imparting different social values and norms, and
also in giving rise to different economic
opportunities. According to the economic framework for fertility analysis,
couples’ background characteristics influence the demand for children (Ward
and Butz, 1980). Namboodiri (1972a,

1972b) has noted that couples’ socioeconomic status and residential background are the important socioinstitutional factors relevant to fertility
behavior. Therefore, women’s educational attainment, age at marriage, and
family size would primarily depend on
CBW. One may hypothesize that
women with urban CBW are likely to
have more education, higher age at
matriage, and thus lower fertility. In
Ahmed’s (1981) study he uses similar
reasoning for the inclusion of the childhood background of husband (CBH).

EDW-— Education of women is one
of the key determinants of fertility as it
delays age at marriage which in turn reduces fertility (Islam and Khan, 1991,
1992). It is observed that educated
mothers limit their family size by using
contraception, and it is also well documented that the more educated the
mother, the more they use contraception (Berelson, 1976). Empirical evidence suggests that EDW is positively
related to age at marriage and negatively to fertility (Rich, 1973; Cochrane, 1983). Ahmed (1981) also argues for the inclusion of education of

husband (EDH), which he believes has

a positive effect on CEB. Khan et al.
(1993) have demonstrated that EDW
has a much greater role than EDH in
controlling fertility in Bangladesh.

Vol. 41, No. 3-4

AMW-—Age at marriage is considered one of the most important variables affecting fertility behavior. In a
noncontraceptive society, early marriage is associated with high fertility.
However, in a society where contraception is frequently practiced this
statement may not be true. Bangladesh
cannot be said to be contraceptive society as only around 31 per cent of
women have ever used contraception
(Huq and Cleland, 1990). Late age at
marriage can affect cumulative marital
fertility by shortening the duration of
marriage within the reproductive span
(Chaudhury, 1984). Several studies
have shown that AMW is inversely related to fertility (Stoeckel and Chaudhury, 1969; Chaudhury, 1984; Khan et
al., 1993).

Under the assumptions of linearity,
additivity, and recursiveness (Boyle,
1970), we used path analysis in which
the variables AGE, REL, CBH, and
CBW are exogenous variables, while
the variables EDW, EDH, AWM and
CEB are endogenous variables in
the hypothetical path model. Ahmed
(1981) also used the assumptions.

The 1989 survey did not collect information on the husband’s childhood
background, so the path involving the
childhood place of residence of the
husband cannot be included. However, this omission will not preclude a
fairly substantive comparison with the
work of Ahmed. The correlation matrix and the regression models explaining the direct and indirect effects for
urban and rural situations are displayed in Tables 2, 3, and 4.

There is similarity between the two
groups of respondents in age and religious background, and one can -observe that the age at marriage and ed
Urban and Rural Fertility

243

ucation are lower for the rural group
and that the number of children ever
born is greater for the rural group.

Multicolinearity, a particular danger in the interpretation of path models, due to its tendency to give rise to
erroneous signs, has been checked by
using the variance inflation factor
(Belsley et al., 1980). No harmful multicolinearity was detected.

From this analysis, we constructed
the path diagrams displayed in Figures

1 and 2. In these path diagrams, a solid

line indicates a significant path, while a
dashed line denotes an insignificant
path. The numerical value (path coefficient) represents the degree of influence of one variable on another.

RESULTS
URBAN MODEL

The women’s childhood _ background, education, and age at marriage all show the expected significant
direct relationship to CEB, in that as
these variables increase, CEB decreases. The converse is the case for
the women’s age. Surprisingly, religion

“has no direct significant influence on

CEB. However, Muslims do have a
significantly lower age at marriage. Religion is found to have an indirect effect
on CEB, but only through AMW. The
variable CBW indirectly influences
CEB through EDW and AMW,, in that
women from urban backgrounds have
significantly more education and a significantly later age at marriage than
women from rural backgrounds. EDW
also has a significant indirect effect on
CEB operating through AMW,, since
as EDW increases so marriage is postponed and the number of children ever

born is reduced. The women’s age does
not have any significant indirect effects
on fertility in the urban case.

RuRAL MODEL

From examination of the rural path
diagram, one can observe that EDW,
AMW, and AGE, as in the urban case,
significant direct effects on CEB. However, the influence of EDW is much
less in the rural case. Unlike in the urban situation, religion has an important direct effect on CEB, as rural
Muslims have significantly more children than rural non-Muslims. Religion
also has significant indirect effects operating through AMW,, (similar to the
urban case) and through EDW since
rural Muslims receive significantly less
education than non-Muslims. EDW
also has an important indirect effect on
AMW, but this is not so strong as in the
urban case. Unlike the urban case, the
women’s age has a significant indirect
effect, operating first on EDW as older

rural women have received significantly less education than their urban
counterparts. CBW only has an important effect on CEB due to its influence on EDW,, in that women from a
rural background, when compared to
women from an urban background, are
significantly less educated.

The differences between path coefficients for the urban and rural cases
are displayed in Table 5. When the coefficients are compared between the
urban and rural cases, we find that age
and religion have a significantly larger
direct impact on CEB in the rural case.
The indirect effects of CBW and AGE
when operating through EDW are
also greater in the rural case. However, the indirect effect of AGE operating through EDW is significantly
greater in the urban situation.

From this analysis one can conclude
that there is evidence to support theories of urbanization leading to fertility
reduction. This conclusion is reached

because the path analysis has demonstrated that urban childhood place of
residence, while having an important
direct effect on reducing fertility, also
significantly increases education levels,
and this increase has a significant effect
in reducing fertility. Another important observation between urban and
rural settings is the reduced direct and
indirect effects of religion in the urban
case. The indirect effect of age also
ceases to be of importance in urban setting. Thus, as urbanization increases, it
appears that education levels and age
at marriage in Bangladesh will increase, and consequently fertility will
continue to decline.

 

CHANGES IN THE EFFECTS SINCE 1975

Ahmed (1981) reported on a similar
analysis of the 1975 BFS, compared the
rural and urban cases, and found
broadly similar results. In Table 6, we
compare the models for the 1989 and
1975 fertility surveys. Unfortunately,
in the 1989 survey two of the variables
that Ahmed used (education and childhood background of the husband) were
not recorded. Therefore, the comparison between the path models is indicative rather than precise, since the
omission of the husbands’ variables
will tend to inflate the effect of the remaining variable in the 1989 case.

From Table 6, one can observe in
the urban case that the direct effects of
AGE and CBW have increased, while
religion no longer has a significant influence on fertility. For urban women,
the fertility-reducing effects of EDW
and AMW have increased over the
fourteen years. When indirect influences on urban CEB are considered, it
is apparent that CBW and religion are
either no longer of importance or their
effects are greatly reduced. Also, the
influence of age on education is no
longer of significance in 1989. The indirect effect of education operating
through age at marriage makes an increased contribution to reducing urban
CEB.

In the rural situation, religion, and
to a lesser extent age, increased their
fertility-promoting effects over the
fourteen-year period. The effect of
religion in increasing rural CEB by
acting to reduce AMW and EDW has
also increased since 1975. These effects
have been counteracted by the increased direct importance of EDW
and AMW acting directly to reduce
rural CEB. Also exerting greater
influence, since 1975, to reduce rural
CEB are the indirect effects of EDW
acting via AMW, and AGE and CBW
operating through EDW. The indirect
effects of AGE and CBW acting
through AMW are no longer important.

DISCUSSION AND
CONCLUSIONS

Findings emerging from this study
have importance for policy makers. It
has been indicated that urban women
from an urban-childhood background
are found to have lower fertility
than their rural-childhood-background
counterparts. However, in the rural
model, urban-childhood background
has an insignificant fertility-reducing
effect. This finding may be due to a
lower proportion of urban-childhood
backgrounds in women living in rural
Bangladesh. On the other hand, disregarding the childhood background,
women residing in urban settings are
found to have lower fertility than rural
counterparts.

Women from an urban childhood
background spend more time in education and marry later. Age is confirmed as having a strong positive effect on fertility, which means that
fertility is seen to be higher in older
women. Considering REL, Muslims
are found to have less education than
non-Muslims in both models. However, the effect is significant only in the
case of rural model. It is also confirmed
that Muslims marry earlier in both the
areas,

Education appears to have a strong
fertility-reducing effect in both models. This finding implies that higher education leads lower fertility. Younger
rural women are found to have a significantly higher educational attainment than the older women, and it is

anticipated that they will therefore be .

likely to have smaller completed family
sizes than did previous rural generations. Therefore, increasing education
at every level can reduce fertility considerably. Moreover, education delays
age at marriage of women which in
turn plays a strong role in fertility reduction in Bangladesh.

These findings are reflective of
Ahmed’s (1981) analysis of BFS 1975,
but there are some important differences (see Table 6). Notably, for the
urban model, CBW now has a significant influence and REL now has an
insignificant effect on CEB. AGE and
REL are no longer important influences of EDW. This finding is likely the

 

manifestation of the expansion of education and the increasing secularization of urban Bangladeshi society. Indeed, the effect of education both
directly on CEB and via AMW has
increased.

When the rural situation is considered in the 1989 BFS, education now
has a significant direct effect on CEB
(contrary to the 1975 case), and AMW
is no longer significantly influenced by
AGE. Religion has increased its-effect
on CEB directly and through EDW
and AMW. AMW’s direct influence on
CEB has also increased, as has EDW
on AMW. Again, this finding supports
the view that there has been an increase in the amount of schooling in

Bangladesh which in turn has led directly and via increasing age at marriage of women to a decline in fertility.
Education in Bangladesh has become
almost universal.

It is puzzling to observe that the influence of religion has increased in rural areas, and this finding remains to be
explained. To conclude, there is evidence that greater urbanization and increased education is having a reducing
effect on fertility, both directly and
through variables such as age at marriage and religion. Much work remains
to be done as neither the 1975 nor the
1989 models fully explained the number of children ever born. (The 1989based model explained around 67 per

cent of the variation in CEB.) Other
explanatory variables require investigation. Also, one should adopt a certain amount of skepticism about some
of the assumptions upon which the
method of path analysis is based. Particularly questionable are the assumptions of only linear relationships between variables and the disregard for
feedback loops.
