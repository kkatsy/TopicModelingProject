ABSTRACT: We conduct a cross-national study of contraceptive discontinuation among currently
married nonsterilized contracepting women in Bolivia, Egypt, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and
Zimbabwe using the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Since the DHS contains no true
completed epochs of contraceptive use, the distribution of use times at survey is used to approximate the distribution of the completed epochs using the renewal theorem. Two techniques based
on this approximation are used. The first technique uses local linear regression smoothing of a
histogram estimate of the use time at survey pdf which is converted into an estimate of the discontinuation probability function. The second technique poses a proportional hazards Weibull
distribution for the discontinuation probability function which is then converted into a model for
the use times at survey. This second technique is used to model the observed variations in use
across countries while controlling for other sociodemographic factors such as children ever born,
age, and education, as well as a variable which encodes knowledge of the fertility cycle. Pill discontinuation probabilities range from 0.12 to 0.47 in the first year. [UD discontinuation probabilities range from 0.18 to 0.53 in the first year. Discontinuation probabilities in Egypt over all
methods are in agreement with those reported in Ali and Cleland (1995). Logged relative risks
of pill discontinuation range from —0.94 (Sri Lanka) to 0 (Kenya), while logged relative risks of
IUD discontinuation range from —0.53 (Sri Lanka) to 0.41 (Zimbabwe). The ordering of risks
of pill discontinuation among the six countries considered is in agreement with the ordering of
total fertility rates excerpted from Westoff (1991).

In this paper we conduct a crossnational study of contraceptive discontinuation among currently married nonsterilized contracepting women in six developing countries using the Demographic and
Health Surveys Phase I (DHS-I), and our
results suggest that relative risks of pill discontinuation across countries rank in order
corresponding to total fertility rates. The
methods developed here are also of interest
in their own right. Analyzing contraceptive
use data for relative risks of discontinuation among subpopulations requires completed events, which means that the required unit of data per individual ts the
length of time of regular uninterrupted use

of a particular method of contraception
from inception to discontinuation (stopping, getting pregnant, or switching to another method). This length of time we will
call a completed event in what follows. The
DHS-I contains duration of use of current
method at survey in addition to length of
use interior to the last two birth intervals.
The duration of use at survey is not a completed event, and the length of use interior
to a birth interval, while being a completed
event, suffers from selection (and recall)
bias. Ali and Cleland (1995) use synthetic
cohorts to conduct a life table analysis of
contraceptive discontinuation by reason
for stopping, although they did no covari

ate analysis. Moreover, the generation of
synthetic cohorts entails further potential
for errors.

The duration of use of current method
at a survey does not suffer from any of
these difficulties and therefore is the most
informative quantity with regards to contraceptive discontinuation in the DHS-I.
With the gain in information comes a different challenge, however, since none of

=these observations constitutes a com“pleted event. If we view the completed
events as repeatable, and thus the oberved duration of use of current method
Rat survey as a backwards recurrence time
oc Allison, 1985; Cox 1962; Sheps and
Menken, 1973), then we may use the
cctools of renewal theory to approximate
the distribution (discontinuation probabilraty) of the completed event from the obSserved backwards recurrence times (dura"Zions of use of current method at survey).
=We shall employ two variants of this
“technique. In the first, a descriptive analyBis, we calculate first- and second-year
odiscontinuation probabilities and mean
‘cuse times from a smoothed histogram es“timate of the pdf of the duration of use at
Burvey divided by its intercept. In the sec‘cond, a regression analysis, a proportional
hazards Weibull model is posed on the
‘unobserved completed events and then
Cconverted into a model for the durations
of use at survey using the renewal theorem.

As mentioned above, the data for this
study are from the DHS-I. The DHS-I,
conducted by the Institute for Resource
Development (IRD) between 1987 and
1993 in Africa, Asia, and Latin America,
interviewed a nationally representative
sample of women aged 15-49. For our
analysis we selected six countries: Bolivia (IRD, 1989), Egypt (IRD, 1992),

Kenya (IRD, 1993), Sri Lanka (IRD,
1987), Thailand (RD, 1987), and Zimbabwe (IRD, 1989). This study includes
only nonsterilized, currently married
women currently using a_ traditional
method (periodic abstinence or withdrawal), the pill, IUD, injectable hormones, vaginal methods, or the condom.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Let 7, denote the completed duration
of contraceptive use for the ith individual.
Information on completed durations is
not available in most countries in the
Demographic and Health Surveys. However, information on backward recurrence
time, e.g., the number of months up to the
time of the survey that the respondent’s
current method has been in use, is available in the standard recode files employed in the present study (DHS, 1994).
We denote this variable as U;. In order to
apply this method we must assume that
conditional upon covariate values, the renewal intensity at survey time is approximately constant, which amounts to the
following assumptions. As usual, we assume independence across individuals.
Second, we must assume that the number
of completed epochs of contraceptive use
is large at the time of the survey (see
Cox, 1962, and Sheps and Menken, 1973,
for a discussion of renewal theory). These
assumptions are necessary in order to ensure that a single completed interval, T,
for the i-th woman is representative of
that woman’s entire contraceptive use
history and furthermore, that U, actually
contains information about 7,. We may
now define the population probability of
discontinuation F(t|X) = P {T<t|X} as
the common marginal distribution of a
completed interval of contraceptive use

conditional upon covariate values. It follows from these assumptions and the renewal theorem that the probability density
function, g, of U (the observed backwards
recurrence time) can be used to reasonably
approximate the cumulative distribution
function, F, of T (the unobserved completed event time) through the relationship:

1 ~— F(u|X) (1)

We will discuss what is meant by “reasonable approximation” in the final section.
This equation forms the basis of two indirect models for the discontinuation probability. The first model is descriptive and
nonparametric in nature and is as follows.
Given categorical response times, we form
an estimate of the discontinuation probability by first forming a smoothed histogram estimate of g. For this we use the
S-plus procedure, “loess” (local linear regression) applied to a simple histogram estimate of g with break points at the limits
of resolution in the dataset, e.g., months
(Cleveland, 1991). Next, from Equation
(1) it can be seen that the reciprocal of the
intercept of this smoothed histogram estimate may be used as a moment estimator
of the mean since F(0) = 0.
E[T|X] = 2(0|X)"' (2a)
By the standard linearization technique,
we have the following estimate of the
standard error of (2a).
var (E(r|xy = VEO! (ap)
BOY’

Continuing by substitution of (2a) into
(1) our moment estimate of the discontinuation probability takes the form:

Also, by the linearization technique, we
have the following pointwise estimated
standard error of the discontinuation probability function (3a).

varlgQ)] 28 Owarl8Q)] _ &O)’varlg(0)]
& (0) 8(0)’ gO

The necessary pointwise standard errors
of g-hat in formulas (3a) and (3b) above
are obtained from the procedure “loess”
which is used to smooth the histogram estimate of g. Notice that the covariance between g-hat at zero and g-hat at y (the
second term in 3b) is estimated as the
variance of g-hat at y which follows since
the error function in the loess smoothing
of g-hat has independent increments and
g-hat equals zero with probability one at
a prespecified time which is sufficiently
large.

Our regression analysis is also based
upon the concepts from renewal theory
leading to Equation 1, and the methods
used in deriving this second model are
along the lines of Allison (1985) which we
redevelop here. The choice of cumulative
distributions F for 7 is constrained by the
requirement of tractability of the resulting
expression for the probability density g of

U. Therefore, T is assumed to follow a

proportional hazards Weibull model:
F(t\X) = 1 — exp(—e”t’), (4)

where a is the shape parameter, X is a vector of covariates, and B, the corresponding
regression coefficients. The corresponding Weibull hazard is:

A(t|X) = ae*te”’, (5)
Notice that the coefficients, 8B, of categorical variables have interpretation as the
log of the relative risk for that category,
while the shape parameter a explains
whether hazard is increasing or decreasing with time by being, respectively,
larger or smaller than one. Next we sub
i Stitute (4) into (1) to obtain an expression

ofor g. As is done in ordinary Weibull re
‘gression, we take the log of the response,
eh = log U, to obtain the linear model.

RESULTS

First we discuss the estimated mean
use times and first- and second-year discontinuation probabilities. These results
are used to motivate the form of the linear
predictor in the regression analysis which
follows. In addition, the techniques of estimation (formulas 2a through 3b) may
be considered as methods of analyzing
backwards recurrence times which are alternative to the regression model (formulas 6 and 7) originally presented by Allison (1985). Table 1 displays, by method

times calculated from Equation (2a) and
corresponding standard errors calculated
from Equation (2b). There are differing
patterns of method choice across the six
countries. For example, traditional methods are used by 62 per cent of the women
in Bolivia, and 16.9 per cent in Kenya but
only by 6.8 per cent in Egypt. Injectable
methods are used by 31.5 per cent of the
women in Kenya, 33.3 per cent in Sri
Lanka, and 17.5 per cent in Zimbabwe,
but only by 3.7 per cent in Thailand.
Condoms are used by 7.5 per cent of the
women in Egypt and by 3.9 per cent in
Kenya. Vaginal methods are not used in

appreciable number in any of the countries considered and thus are omitted
from our analyses. The pill and IUD are
used extensively in all countries and
therefore will play an important role in
our analysis. The most striking feature of
mean use times by method is the high
level of variation within each country
across methods as well as within each
method across countries. Mean use times
for the pill range from 67 months (Sri
Lanka) down to 19 months (Kenya) and
are in the following order by country
from highest to lowest: Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bolivia, Egypt, Zimbabwe, and

Kenya. Mean use times for the IUD range
from 61 months (Sri Lanka) down to 16
months (Zimbabwe) and are in the following order by country from highest to
lowest: Sri Lanka, Thailand, Kenya, Bolivia, Egypt, and Zimbabwe. Corresponding standard errors are small enough to
warrant consideration of effects due to
country and method type.

Next we tum attention to the estimated
first- and second-year discontinuation prob5 abilities which are displayed in Table 2.
g First-year discontinuation probabilities for
9 oral contraceptives range from 0.12 (BoS livia) to 0.47 (Kenya) and are in the followS ing order from lowest to highest: Bolivia,
+ Sri Lanka, Thailand, Egypt, Zimbabwe, and
~ Kenya. First-year discontinuation probabiliSties for the IUD range from 0.18 (Sri
'S Lanka) to 0.53 (Zimbabwe) and are in the
= following order from lowest to highest: Sri

— and Zimbabwe. The first- and second-year

7 in Table 1 that pill and IUD use predomi3 nate over other methods in all countries and
= that among the two, IUD use is the more
3 prevalent in all countries except Kenya and
Q Zimbabwe, where oral contraceptive use is

the more prevalent.

For purposes of comparison we provide in Table 3 first- and second-year discontinuation probabilities by method type
for Egypt and Thailand calculated by Ali
and Cleland, 1995.' Comparison of the

‘‘all methods” column with the results of
Ali and Cleland (Table 3) shows good
agreement in the case of Egypt, but substantial difference tn the case of Thailand.
The fact that our estimates give rise to an

ordering which mimics that of total fertil
ity rates (Table 5) suggest that our results
in the case of Thailand are more accurate. °

We now turn attention to the regression analysis. As discussed in the methods section, we use the “generalized
gamma,” specified in equations (6) and
(7) to estimate relative risks of discontinuation and baseline hazard (shape parameter) from the logged times of use at
survey. Because of small numbers in various cells relating to method use by country, we decided to merge the data from
separate countries together, dummy-ing
the countries as “B,” “E,” “S,” “T,’ and
“Z” with Kenya as the reference category.
It is well known (Hammerslough, 1991)
that sociodemographic factors such as
age, parity, and level of education have a
measurable effect upon contraceptive discontinuation. Several authors (Hadley,
1983, and Sheon et al., 1989) argue that
while it is clear that good knowledge of

the time of highest fertility in the men
strual cycle is necessary for successful
usage of so-called natural family planning, such knowledge could enhance the
user effectiveness of nonpermanent modern methods as well. Therefore, we incorporate factors of age, parity, education,
residence, as well as knowledge of fertility cycle in our analyses. of international

significant in increasing the relative risk of
discontinuing traditional method use. This
phenomenon also has an accepted substantive explanation. Women using traditional
methods correctly who know their fertility

‘cycle will switch to conventional methods

during times of peak fertility.

The main research hypothesis is a test
of ordering relative risks by country. The
results corresponding to users of the pill
and IUD had the most significant effects by
use of country, with ordering risk of discontinuation in good agreement with the
results of the mean use times of Table 1
with the exception of the placement of Bolivia. Logged relative risks of pill discontinuation range from —0.93 (Sri Lanka) to

Thailand and Egypt and the.gap between

order by country from lowest to highest:
Sn Lanka, Thailand, Bolivia, Kenya,

Kenya and Zimbabwe is marginally significant, the gap between Kenya and Bolivia is
moderately significant, and the gap between Thailand and Sri Lanka is highly
significant. Notice that the ordering of risks
of pill discontinuation among the six countries considered is in agreement with the
ordering of total fertility rates as reported
in Table 5 which are excerpted from Westoff (1991).

one, indicating decreasing hazards for each
of the methods.

DISCUSSION

We have seen in the last section how to
use two methods in the analysis of back
wards recurrence times of contraceptive
use. The first method employs “loess” to
smooth a histogram estimate of the backwards recurrence time density, which is
then formed into a survival function estimate using Equation 1. Inherent in this approximation is a variant of the law of large
numbers known as the renewal theorem
(see any standard text on probability theory or renewal theory, for example, Cox,
1962). In order for this approximation to

be valid, there are two major conditions to
check which we have here assumed to be
upheld. Is the renewal intensity approximately constant? Have there been a large
number of renewals (method stops) at survey? To get a feel for the performance of
the smoothing technique, we display in
Figure 1 the histogram estimate of the
backwards recurrence time density, g, and
overlay the results of the “loess” smoothing, g-hat. Notice that the smoothed histogram estimate is monotone decreasing
(without having been constrained to be so),
which is a good sign that the smoothed
graph divided by its intercept could potentially approximate a survival function. In
addition, the fact that our results are in
agreement with the findings of an independent study (see Table 3) would seem to verify the validity of such an approach.

The other issue to be discussed is sample size. Recall that the orderings corresponding to pill and to IUD use obtained
via the discontinuation probabilities versus
those obtained via the regression analysis
were for the most part in agreement. This
finding suggests that a sample size of 200
is sufficient for this type of analysis. The
exception to agreement in ordering was in
the case Bolivia with a sample size of 31
pill users and 40 IUD users.

Another desirable facet of our method
is that it requires no data imputation or
synthetic cohort construction as is required in the methodology used by other
authors (Ali and Cleland, 1995). Our substantive findings suggest that there are
quite different patterns of use of the pill
and of the [UD across the six countries
considered here. The rank by risks of discontinuation partitions six countries into

groups of similar risk level. For the pill
method, Kenya is in the high group, then
Zimbabwe, Bolivia, and Egypt are in the
middle group, and then Thailand and Sri
Lanka are in the Jow group. For the JUD
method we have four significantly different groups. Zimbabwe is the highest, followed by the Egypt/Kenya, followed by
the Bolivia/Thailand group with Sri Lanka
in the lowest group. Perhaps most interesting is that the relative risks of discontinuation for the pill rank the countries in
exactly the same order as corresponding
total fertility rates (Westoff, 1991).

CONCLUSION

In conclusion it must be stressed that
the two forms of backwards recurrence
time analysis used here are quite appropriate for analysis of contraceptive discontinuation rates using DHS data in that
they do not require synthetic cohorts or
data imputation, using instead the most
accurate (on the basis of individual recall
accuracy) information of duration of contraceptive use (that being the most recent). The fact that the methods agree
with and may actually improve those of
an independent study (Ali and Cleland,
1995) also adds support to this premise.
