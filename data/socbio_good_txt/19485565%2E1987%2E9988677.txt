ABSTRACT: This paper reports on an examination of whether the effects of farm background
on socioeconomic differentials in fertility are diminished among nonfarm couples. The data
are for a sample of white ever-married women belonging to the 1901-1910 birth cohorts. The
research provides another test of the two-generation—urbanite hypothesis first advanced by
Goldberg. Unlike a number of other studies, the findings do not support the hypothesis. Reasons for the lack of support are discussed, and methodological weaknesses of previous studies

are identified.

In 1959, Goldberg noted that the socioeconomic differentials in fertility observed for urban couples was produced
by the relatively high fertility of couples
with a farm background before marriage. On the basis of this finding, as well
as a similar finding for another urban
population, Goldberg (1960) proposed
the two-generation-urbanite hypothesis, stating that the existence in urban
populations of an inverse pattern of fertility by socioeconomic status “results
largely or entirely from the fertility behavior of farm migrants. ...” Freedman and Slesinger (1961) extended this
hypothesis to apply to the entire nonfarm population, not just urban populations. They found some confirmation of
the hypothesis for two-generation—
nonfarm couples. Further support for
this hypothesis was provided by Duncan
(1965) in his study of a national sample.

In effect, the two-generation—urbanite hypothesis became in reality
the two-generation-nonfarm hypothesis. Not only was farm background

firmly established as an important determinant of fertility, but the expectation
has been that fertility differentials by socioeconomic status would gradually diminish and even disappear once the
population became predominantly urban. Indeed, the general view expressed
by anumber of demographers is that, as
various subpopulations adopt modern
values and norms and are absorbed into
the modern economic system, the major
socioeconomic differentials in fertility
will disappear (see, for example, Freedman and Slesinger, 1961; Ryder, 1973).
More recently, McGirr and Hirschman (1979) have questioned the validity
of this expectation. In their analysis of
data from the 1960 Growth of American
Families Study and the 1965 and 1970
National Fertility Surveys, fairly strong
fertility differentials among nonfarm
couples regardless of farm background
were observed. Moreover, they suggest
that the previous finding may have been
confined to particular cohorts of American women who completed most of their

childbearing prior to the baby-boom
period. Because of this discrepancy of
findings in different studies and the view
that the relationship between farm
background and socioeconomic differentials in fertility obtained only before
the baby boom, a reanalysis of fertility
differentials with data for the 19011910 birth cohorts is particularly appropriate.

By the time of the baby boom, the cohorts of 1901-1910 were near or at the
end of their childbearing period. Further, these cohorts are distinctive in
terms of having the lowest completed
family size in U.S. demographic history.
Also, they grew up in a period when the
nation was not yet highly urbanized. By
1920, when women belonging to the
1901-1910 cohorts were 10~20 years of
age, only slightly more than one-half (51
per cent) of the American population
was urban.

In this paper we analyze data from a
national sample of white ever-married
women belonging to the 1901-1910
birth cohorts to investigate the effects of
farm background on socioeconomic differentials in fertility. We find, as McGirr
and Hirschman (1979) did, that farm
background before marriage does not
account for the socioeconomic differentials in fertility observed among nonfarm couples. Further, we suggest that
the earlier findings of Goldberg (1959,
1960), Freedman and Slesinger (1961)
and Duncan (1965) are most likely the
result of employing data in which a relatively large number of cohorts are aggregated and/or different measures of farm
background and socioeconomic status
are used.

In the next section we discuss our
data and methods and compare them
with previous studies. We then present

Two-generation Hypothesis 221

our analysis and explore some of the implications of our findings concerning the
nonsupport of the two-generation—
nonfarm hypothesis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data examined in this paper are
retrospective reproductive histories obtained in personal interviews with a national probability sample of 1,049 white,
ever-married women born between July
1, 1900 and June 30, 1910. At the time of
interview, 1978, the women were 67 to
77 years of age. Excluded from the sample were women residing in institutions
(less than 5 per cent), women marrying
for the first time at age 45 or later, and
foreign-born women who migrated to
the United States after attaining age 30.
The interview response rate was 71.6
per cent.

As with all surveys, these data are
subject to various types of error, such as
sampling errors and errors made during
the collection and processing of data. In
addition to these types of error, these
data are subject to two important
sources of potential bias, namely selective nonresponse and selective mortality. Previous surveys of the elderly (Atchley, 1961; Benus and Ackerman,
1971; Kish, 1965) and our pretest experience indicated that we might expect a
relatively high rate of nonresponse.
Therefore, a follow-up of all nonrespondents was planned to occur shortly after
the completion of the fieldwork (Ridley
et al., 1979) as well as the usual type of
analysis as to the representativeness of
the sample in 1978. In addition, a comparison of the sample with 1950 census
data for the cohorts of 1901-1910 was
undertaken to assess the representativeness of the sample when the women be

1A detailed assessment of the representativeness of the sample has been conducted. The most
serious underrepresentation is that of childless
women. On the basis of the 1950 census data, 19.2
per cent of white ever-married women were childless while registration data indicated a proportion
closer to 20 per cent. In fact, only 14.4 per cent of
the sample reported they had no live births. Thus,
the unweighted sample would produce a somewhat higher overall mean fertility than the
weighted sample.

findings held when each race was considered separately.” Since all of the previous studies focused on currently married couples, our initial analysis is
restricted to women who reported they
were currently married in 1950. In further explorations of the data, we restrict
the analysis to women married to their
first husband for at least ten years.

To replicate as closely as possible the
previous analyses, data are needed for
four measures: (1) farm background before marriage of the wife and of her husband; (2) couples’ current residence; (3)
a measure of socioeconomic status; and
(4) number of live births.

Wives and their husbands are classified in our sample as having a farm
background based on the responses to
the following question: “Did you (he)
ever live on a farm before you were married?” This classification coincides most
closely with the measures used by
Freedman and Slesinger (1961) and
McGirr and Hirshman (1979). Freedman and Slesinger employed “ever lived
on a farm before marriage’’ while
McGirr’s and Hirschman’s measure was
“longest residence before marriage.”
Goldberg (1959, 1960) and Duncan
(1965), however, based their measures
on whether the wife’s and husband’s fathers had a farm occupation.?

?Another study (Kuhn and Munson, 1979) employing data for black couples from the 1973 National Survey of Family Growth, however, confirmed the findings of McGirr and Hirschman
(1979).

3Extensive pretesting prior to the survey indicated that few women knew their husband’s father’s occupation. Thus, this question was not included in the final interview schedule. For the 536
women in our sample who reported having lived
on a farm before marriage, 70 per cent reported
that their father’s main occupation when they were
growing up was a farm occupation. Seventy-seven
per cent of these women reported having spent at
least half of their life on a farm before marriage
with 82 per cent reporting a farm occupation for
their father.

Social Biology

The measurement of current residence did not pose a problem to the
other investigators since they used residence at the time of interview. To rely
on women’s residence at the time of interview for our sample did not seem reasonable, since these women were interviewed when they were 67 to 77 years of
age. Instead, we employ the data on reported residence in 1950 when the
women were approximately 40 to 49
years of age for purposes of classifying
women as to farm or nonfarm residence.* This measure is quite comparable to those used by Goldberg (1959,
1960), Duncan (1965), and McGirr and
Hirschman (1979) since they confined
their analyses to women near or at the
end of their childbearing period.

In addition to residence in 1950, in
some analyses we employ a measure of
residence during the first ten years of
married life. This measure is based on
the husband’s occupation at marriage or
ten years after marriage. If the husband’s occupation was reported as a
farm occupation at either point in time,
the couple was classified as residing ona
farm sometime during the first ten years
of married life.

Although Goldberg (1959, 1960) employed several measures of socioeconomic status, all the investigators including Goldberg used educational
attainment. By employing educational
attainment as a measure of socioeconomic status, we can compare our findings with all the previous studies. Also,
education is generally completed by
marriage and consequently tends to be
invariate over the childbearing period.
Because of our small sample size, we

categorize wife’s and husband’s educational attainment into four levels: 0—7
years, 8-11 years, 12 years, and 13 or
more years.

Finally, for the measure of fertility
we use the total number of live births as
reported by the women in our sample.
With the exception of Freedman and
Slesinger (1961) who, in addition to
number of live births, employed expected number of live births as a proxy
for completed fertility, all the other
studies relied exclusively on number of
live births.

RESULTS

In analyzing our data to test the twogeneration-nonfarm hypothesis, we
first use the design employed by Duncan
(1965) and later replicated by McGirr
and Hirschman (1979). We then turn to
data on farm experience after marriage
available for our sample of women belonging to the 1901-1910 birth cohorts.
Rather than using the nonhierarchial
model employed by Duncan and by
McGirr and Hirschman, we employ a
somewhat more flexible parameterization of the general linear model, referred to as the cell means model (Hocking and Speed, 1975; Namboodiri et al.,
1975).

Table 2 presents the mean number of
live births by residence in 1950 and husband’s and wife’s farm background before marriage for women belonging to
the 1901-1910 birth cohorts who were
currently married in 1950. In this table,
data are shown for the 943 couples for
whom information is available on residence in 1950 and farm background. As
would be expected, very few couples (16
per cent) were residing on a farm in
1950. Among these couples the 119 farm
couples with a farm background exhibit
fertility substantially higher than for
couples with a nonfarm residence in
1950.

Since the focus of the twogeneration-nonfarm hypothesis is on
couples with a nonfarm residence, further analysis is restricted to the first two
columns of Table 2. Couples with a nonfarm residence in 1950 among whom
neither the husband nor wife had a farm
background (i.e., the two-generation—
nonfarm residents) exhibit the lowest
fertility, an average of 2.0 births; yet
their fertility is hardly distinguishable
from the fertility of 1950 nonfarm residents among whom only the wife had a
farm background (i.e., 2.1 births). In

-contrast, if the husband had a farm

background, the fertility of nonfarm

couples is somewhat higher, an average
of 2.5 births, regardless of wife’s farm
background. Among nonfarm couples,
husband’s farm background, therefore,
appears to be more important than that
of the wife in its effect on fertility.

To test whether this is the case we use
the cell means model. For the data
shown in the first two columns of Table 2
the model is written for each individual
as follows:

x4 = 1, for couples having a nonfarm
residence in 1950 and both husband and wife a farm background;
0, otherwise

e = the stochastic error term.

Before examining whether the couple’s farm background has significant
main effects on the total number of
births, we first test whether there is an
interaction between husband’s and
wife’s farm background among couples
with a nonfarm residence in 1950. The
result of the test indicates that husband’s
farm background and wife’s farm background have independent effects on fertility (F = 0.046, df = 1,790, p > 0.05).

 

Social Biology

An analysis of the main effects indicates, as expected, that husband’s farm
background is significant (F = 9.361, df
= 1,790, p < 0.01) and wife’s farm
background is not significant (F =
1.116, df = 1,790, p > 0.05).°

This finding that only husband’s farm
background affects the fertility of nonfarm couples for the sample of 19011910 birth cohorts contrasts with the
previous finding of Duncan (1965). His
data indicated that nonfarm residents
who had no farm experience before
marriage had lower fertility than couples with a nonfarm residence but with either the wife or husband having a farm
background. Therefore, our results conform more closely to those obtained by
McGirr and Hirschman (1979) for the
cohorts of 1911-35. We should note
that Goldberg (1959) employed only
husband’s farm background and in his
later study (1960) did not differentiate
between husband’s and wife’s farm
background in his classification of couples with farm background. Freedman’s
and Slesinger’s (1961) classification similarly did not differentiate between husband’s and wife’s farm background.

The major question posed originally
by Goldberg (1959, 1960) and investigated in the subsequent studies, however, is whether the socioeconomic differentials in fertility are diminished (or
disappear) among nonfarm residents
when only couples with a nonfarm background are considered. The data in Table 3 present the mean number of live
births for couples having a nonfarm resi
SBecause the distribution of the dependent variable, number of live births, is skewed, we also
tested these hypotheses and subsequent hypotheses using the cell means model by taking the natural logarithm of number of live births. The results
were roughly equivalent to those reported here.

dence in 1950 by wife’s and husband’s
farm background and wife’s and husband’s education. An examination of
these data shows that educational differentials in fertility do exist for the nonfarm couples with no farm background
as well as for couples where either the
husband or wife or both have a farm
background. In fact, for the four groups,
fertility decreases monotonically as educational level of wife and husband increases. To test whether the observed
differentials by wife’s and husband’s education are significant, we again employ
the cell means model written as follows:

significant.° Although these results obtained for the 1901-1910 birth cohorts
differ sharply from the findings of Goldberg (1959, 1960), Freedman and Slesinger (1961), and Duncan (1965), they
do agree with the results obtained by
McGirr and Hirschman (1979). Thus,
our data do not support the two-generation-nonfarm hypothesis. Nevertheless,
despite the statistical significance of the
fertility differentials by wife’s and husband’s education, there is some attenuation of the differentials among twogeneration-nonfarm couples. We
should note, however, that the educational differentials for these couples are
considerably greater than those observed by Duncan (1965). He found a
differential among two-generationnonfarm couples of only 0.4 births by
wife’s education and 0.6 by husband’s
education. In contrast, the differentials
we observe are 0.8 for wife’s education
and 1.3 for husband’s education.

To further investigate this discrepancy in our finding regarding fertility
differentials by education for nonfarm
couples with no farm background, we
examined additional data on farm residence available for this sample of
women. Although a detailed residential
history was not obtained, questions
were asked concerning the husband’s
main occupation at marriage and ten

The results of the tests of the differentials by
wife’s education (upper panel, Table 3) are as follows: (1) husband and wife, nonfarm background:
F = 3.43, df = 3,778, p < 0.5; (2) husband, nonfarm, and wife, farm: F = 4.36, df = 3,778, p<
0.01; (3) husband, farm, and wife, nonfarm: F =
10.43, df = 3,778, p < 0.01; (4) husband and wife,
farm: F = 6.67, df = 3,778, p = < 0.01. For husband’s education the results are: (1) husband and
wife, nonfarm background: F = 4,25, df = 3,778,
p < 0.01; (2) husband, nonfarm, and wife, farm: F
= 5.96, df = 3,778, p < 0.01; (3) husband, farm,
and wife, nonfarm: F = 8.53, df = 3,778, p
< 0.01; (4) husband and wife, farm: F = 3.73, df
= 3,778, p = < 0.05.

years after marriage. If the husband’s
occupation was reported as a farm occupation either at the beginning or the end
of the ten year period, women were classified as living on a farm at least sometime during the first ten years of marriage. In analyzing these data, the
analysis was restricted to those women
who were married to their first husband
for at least ten years.

Such a classification focuses on what
presumably is an important period in a
couple’s married life and provides a
measure of the social milieu in which
couples begin their married life. For the
vast majority of couples this is the period in which childbearing is initiated;
and for many, terminated. Additionally, this is the period in which experience and expertise in the use of contraception is developed. In contrast, a
measure of residence at the end of the
childbearing period may confound the
identification of couples who are nonfarm residents with no farm experience.
Residence at the end of the childbearing
period may not, for some couples, be a
valid indicator of the type of community
in which they were living when they
made their decisions regarding their
childbearing. Moreover, by using data
on the farm background of husbands of
women currently married in 1950, the
data in some instances refer to husbands
who were not always the fathers of their
children since many women had by 1950
experienced divorce or widowhood and
remarried. Consequently, some couples
could have been misclassified as to farm
background.

Presumably then, better measures of
residence after marriage and farm background should lead to support of the hypothesis that fertility differentials will
disappear or become negligible in the
nonfarm population. That is, do educa

’Unweighted number of women.

tional differentials in fertility persist
among couples with a nonfarm residence the first ten years of marriage and
nonfarm backgrounds? Table 4 presents
the mean number of live births for
women married at least ten years to
their first husband who had a nonfarm
residence the first ten years of marriage
by husband’s and wife’s farm background and education. As may be seen,
an inverse relationship between wife’s
and husband’s education and fertility
appears to exist regardless of farm background. For couples where neither the
wife nor the husband had a farm background, however, the differentials are
not as large as among couples where either the wife or husband or both had a
farm background. The differentials are

larger, however, by wife’s education
than husband’s education.

To test whether the differentials are
significant, a cell means model is again
employed. The model is written exactly
the same as shown for Equation (2) and
similar constraints imposed. The results
indicate that the educational differentials are statistically significant for couples with a nonfarm background as well
as for couples where either or both hada
farm background.’ Therefore, even

7The results of the tests for wife’s education are
as follows: (1) husband and wife, nonfarm background: F = 2.91, df = 3,696, p = <0.05; (2)
husband, nonfarm, and wife, farm: F = 5.41, df =
3,696, p = <0.01; (3) husband, farm, and wife,
nonfarm: F = 8.89, df = 3,696, p = < 0.01; and
(4) husband and wife, farm: F = 5.71, df = 3,696
and p = <0.01. For husband’s education the

when the measure of residence in the
first ten years of marriage is substituted
for residence at the end of the childbearing period, we do not find support for
the two-generation hypothesis. Nevertheless, the argument can be made again
that the differentials in fertility by education for couple having no farm experience before marriage and in the first ten
years of marriage, although statistically
significant, are less than for couples with
a farm background. When compared
with the differentials in Table 3, however, they remain, in most instances, as
large. |

While the focus of the hypothesis is
on the diminution or disappearance of
socioeconomic differentials in fertility
among couples who have not had farm
experience before or after marriage, the
differentials by education shown in Tables 3 and 4 for couples with a farm
background are also of interest. As observed in both tables, the differentials
are particularly large; yet, when compared to the nonfarm couples with no
farm experience, when the wife’s education is eight or more years, fertility levels are quite similar. Most important, if
the wife has thirteen or more years of
education, couples having a farm background have somewhat lower fertility
than two-generation—nonfarm couples.
A possible explanation for this similar or
lower fertility is that these couples in
adapting to the new nonfarm environment accept more readily the norms regarding low fertility than their lesser educated counterparts. This finding

results of the tests are: (1) husband and wife, non
farm: F = 5.90, df = 3,696, p = < 0.01; (2) husband, nonfarm, and wife, farm: F = 3.02, df =
3,696, p = <0.05; (3) husband, farm, and wife,
nonfarm: F = 7.94, df = 3,696, p = < 0.01; and
(4) husband and wife, farm F = 3.98, df = 3,696, p
= < 0.01.

Social Biology

suggests that those with a higher educational level are more likely to be integrated into the social and economic
structures of the nonfarm population
than those having a lower educational
level.

Of interest also is the fact that this
finding for couples with an eighth grade
or higher educational attainment of either the wife or husband is similar to that
made by Kiser (1938) based on data
from surveys carried out in Columbus
and Syracuse between 1930 and 1933.
He found that native white couples who
had moved from villages and rural areas
to cities before marriage and among
whom husbands had white collar or
skilled blue collar occupations had fertility similar to the fertility of couples
born in cities who were of the same age
and occupational status.

DISCUSSION

The lack of support for the twogeneration—nonfarm hypothesis reported here for the 1901~—1910 birth cohort agrees with the findings by McGirr
and Hirschman (1979) for the birth cohorts of 1911-35. Thus, a number of
questions arise concerning the results
obtained by previous investigators in
support of this hypothesis.

As noted earlier, the various studies
focusing on the effects of farm background on socioeconomic fertility differentials have employed different types
of samples, measures of farm background and socioeconomic status. Indéed, these differences may be a plausible explanation for the differing results
in that the two-generation—urbanite hypothesis as originally proposed by Goldberg (1959, 1960) was based on his findings for two urban samples, namely
Detroit and Indianapolis. Thus, subsequent studies in extending the test of his

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 34, No. 3-4

hypothesis to national samples never
truly replicated his original studies. But
both the Detroit and Indianapolis samples, it should be recognized, can hardly
be considered representative of U.S. urban populations in the 1940’s and
1950’s. Although Goldberg found the
strongest support for the Detroit sample, and Detroit in the 1950’s was the
fifth largest metropolitan area in the
United States, Detroit’s population was
somewhat distinctive from other urban
populations. In the 1940’s, Detroit was
the destination of a large number of migrants from the South, a high fertility
area. Thus, Goldberg most likely was
comparing couples who grew up in the
South—many of whom had a southern
farm background—with couples who
not only did not have a farm background
but grew up outside the South. However, he did find significant fertility differentials by wife’s education for the
two-generation urbanites although he
did not observe them for the other socioeconomic measures he used.

A further difficulty with the Detroit
study was that Goldberg aggregated the
data of a relatively large number of cohorts. He employed data for currently
married women 40 years and over, and
his sample included women born as far
back as the 1870’s. Thus, he was aggregating the fertility experience of birth
cohorts of 1870-1918. The completed
fertility of successive cohorts from the
1870’s through the cohorts of 1900-1910
was declining while the completed fertility of the cohorts born after 1910 was increasing. We suspect that Goldberg’s
findings for Detroit were the result of
averaging the effect of differences in the
fertility of the various cohorts. This, of
course, would not be a problem if the
completed fertility of the cohorts being
examined was approximately the same.

Two-generation Hypothesis

231

Further, since the farm experience and
socioeconomic status of the cohorts was
also changing, it is highly probable that
the differential weighting of the various
cohorts in the groups being examined by
farm background and status were producing the attenuation of differentials
being observed.

In Goldberg’s study of Indianapolis,
a smaller midwestern city than Detroit,
the sample was constrained by the eligibility requirements of the original Indianapolis study. The sample thus included only couples who had at least an
eighth-grade education, married in
1927-29, had lived most of their married life in an urban place, and who were
Protestant and defined as “relatively fecund.” He did not find a differential in
the average fertility between couples
having a farm background and the twogeneration urbanites, but he did observe
fairly strong differentials for all measures of socioeconomic status among
couples with a farm background but not
for couples with an urban background.

The difficulties of adequately testing
Goldberg’s (1959) hypothesis may have
been compounded by the extension of
the hypothesis to nationally representative samples by Freedman and Slesinger
(1961) and Duncan (1965). The nonfarm populations included in the 1955
sample employed by Freedman and Slesinger (1961) and the 1962 sample employed by Duncan without doubt were
composed of a mixture of couples with
varying residential histories as is true for
our sample. At the time of interview,
some of the couples presumably had
grown up and resided in small towns located in states more rural in character
than the national average while others
had grown up and resided in large urban
centers or metropolitan communities
since birth. Moreover, there was then,

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

232 Ridley et al.

as there continues to be today, a high
rate of migration between communities
among the nonfarm population.
Although the study by Freedman and
Slesinger (1961) found some support for
Goldberg’s (1959) hypothesis, their
findings do not provide unequivocal
support. They found that for couples
married more than ten years there was a
substantial negative association by education among couples with a nonfarm
background, while for couples married
less than ten years a positive relationship was observed. Thus, Freedman and
Slesinger (1961) speculated that the disappearance of an inverse relationship
among couples married less than ten
years may indicate a transition in fertility differentials. Yet, McGirr and
Hirschman (1979) come to the opposite
conclusion. Since they relied on national
samples of a later date than those employed by Freedman and Slesinger
(1961) or Duncan (1965), they suggest
that the findings of earlier studies may
have been “‘time specific (or applicable)
to only certain cohorts”. They note that
their data indicate a weakening of support for more recent cohorts.
Moreover, as mentioned previously,
Goldberg (1959) did not find support for
his hypothesis when he used education
as a measure of socioeconomic status in
his analysis of the Detroit sample. For
the sample of Indianapolis, however, he
did find that for all measures of socioeconomic status, including education,
his hypothesis was supported. Nevertheless, the Indianapolis sample was
greatly restricted and could hardly be
considered representative of all urban
populations. To some extent, therefore,
Duncan’s (1965) findings regarding the
attentuation of educational differentials
for couples with no farm background

Social Biology

agree with Goldberg’s for the Indianapolis sample but disagree with the finding
for the Detroit sample. Additionally,
Duncan’s (1965) finding for educational
differentials do not agree with those of
Freedman and Slesinger (1961).

One other major difference among
the various samples should also be mentioned. As indicated in our analysis the
use of currently married women as of
1950 could lead to some misclassification of the farm background of the husband because the woman’s husband in
1950 did not necessarily have to be the
father of her children. In 1950, the
women in our sample were 40 to 49
years of age and therefore might have
been widowed or divorced and had remarried by 1950. All of the samples in
the other studies could also suffer from
the possibility of this misclassification by
focusing on currently married couples.
Further, in the sample employed by
Duncan (1965), the husband was the respondent. Since the questions regarding
the current wife were answered by the
husband, it is likely not only that the
wife’s fertility could be misreported
since he might not be the father of her
children but also that the background
residence of the wife would be misclassified.

As previously noted, none of the subsequent studies, including this one, have
truly replicated Goldberg’s (1959) original study of Detroit. Moreover, our examination of the findings of the previous
studies suggests that complete support
for the hypothesis was not always found.
Until we can carefully replicate other
studies, definitive answers to such questions as to whether fertility differentials
by socioeconomic status will disappear
or have become attentuated must remain an unanswered question.
