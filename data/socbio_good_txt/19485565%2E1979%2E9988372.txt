ABSTRACT: Although geneticists studying schizophrenia have made great advances by means of
quasi-experimental studies of twins and of adoptees and their parents, epidemiologic studies of
broader populations are now called for to investigate the role of social factors together with genetic
factors in the etiology of schizophrenia. To form a productive partnership, epidemiology and
genetics must not only build on their separate achievements but also overcome problems in their
research methods. One problem is that studies limited to treated cases may yield biased results.
Second, in the past, variations in diagnostic criteria have led to confusing results in both genetic and
epidemiologic research. It is proposed that future research use improved epidemiologic procedures
now available and build on the strong epidemiologic finding of an inverse relation between social
class and prevalence of schizophrenia to test genetic models by investigating class-specific rates of

disorder in particular kinds of relatives.

In their research on schizophrenia,
geneticists have done an impressive set of
elegant quasi-experiments. We refer not
only to studies of monozygotic and dizygotic twins, but also to adoption studies.
The latter include both follow-up investigations of the adopted children of schizophrenic mothers as against nonschizophrenic mothers, and studies of the
biological and adoptive parents of schizophrenic adoptees. The results of this body
of quasi-experimental research lead convincingly to two conclusions. First, heredity
is a factor in the etiology of schizophrenia.
Second, the magnitude of its influence
leaves considerable room for social factors.

For all their elegance, twin and adoption
studies are poor designs for studying the
influence of varied social conditions on the
development of schizophrenia. The populations of twins and of adoptees are both
too small and too restricted to represent the
full range of possible social influences, such

142

aS variation in social class. Therefore,
geneticists are turning to studies of broader
populations and hence to epidemiologic research to fill in the picture of the etiology of
schizophrenia. To form a productive
partnership for this purpose, epidemiology
and genetics must not only build on their
separate achievements but also overcome
problems in the research methods that they
bring with them. Let us see what these
problems are and how we may solve them.

Most epidemiologic studies of schizophrenia are based on admissions to psychiatric treatment, usually on hospital ad- .
missions. The question is how accurately
these rates indicate the magnitude of the
problem of schizophrenia in general populations. Many epidemiologists, particularly
in Europe, have based their studies on the
tenet that all schizophrenics are eventually
treated in hospitals (@degaard, 1961). Nor
is this belief restricted to European researchers. Dunham, one of the pioneers in

American psychiatric epidemiology, stated
a similar opinion and cited A. H. Leighton,
the director of the Stirling County study, as
Saying in a private conversation that most
persons who show symptoms of schizophrenia, at least among those living in urban industrial centers, are likely to come to
official recognition not long after the symptoms become manifest (Dunham, 1965, pp.
33-34).

Despite its importance, surprisingly few
investigators have studied the relation of
untreated to treated rates of schizophrenia
in the general population. Only a small
minority of studies that reported the true
prevalence of schizophrenia in a community included data on which of the subjects
judged to be cases had ever been in treatment with members of the mental health
professions. We have found seven such epidemiologic studies.

COMPARISON OF “TRUE” AND
TREATED RATES

The findings from these seven studies
are summarized in Table 1. Clearly, they do
not provide a simple answer to the question
of what proportion of schizophrenics receive treatment for their disorder. At one
extreme, Bremer (1951) reported in his
study of a small Norwegian fishing village
that all cases had been treated, thus sup

porting the position of epidemiologists such
as @degaard, Leighton, and Dunham. At
the other extreme, Brunetti (1964) found
that only SO per cent of cases he identified in
a small town in France had been treated.
The question is: Which of these figures is
closer to the truth?

For a possible answer to this question,
we turn our attention to an aspect of the
procedures in these studies. In order to
identify cases, these investigators made
diagnoses based on interview data collected
from community informants and, in many
instances, from the subjects themselves. In
general, their finding when all types of disorder are considered is that the more severe
the diagnosis the greater the likelihood that
persons identified as cases had been treated
for the disorder (Link and Dohrenwend,
1978). This finding coincides neatly with
the expectation that the more ill a person is,
the more likely he or she is to enter treatment. However, an alternate explanation,
which is particularly applicable to schizophrenia, is suggested by some results from
an epidemiologic study by Helgason (1964)
of a two-year birth cohort in Iceland. He reported two levels of diagnostic certainty:
definite and questionable. He also reported
how many of the cases at each level of certainty had been in treatment. Among 36
definite cases of schizophrenia, 83 per cent
had been in treatment whereas only 33 per
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

144 Dohrenwend et al.

cent of the six questionable cases had been
treated. These results suggest that an epidemiologist working in a community setting
may be more reluctant to diagnose schizophrenia when the person has not been
treated than when he has. Given this possible bias against finding untreated cases of
schizophrenia, it seems clear that we should
not discount the findings of studies that reported untreated cases in the community. If
we were to draw a quantitative conclusion
on this issue, perhaps the best estimate of
the proportion of cases of schizophrenia
likely to be counted if only treated cases are
included is the median figure in Table 1, 83
per cent.

A further problem with rates based on

treated cases is that the ratio of treated to

untreated cases is likely to vary in different
subgroups of the population. As Pasamanick (1961) noted of his research in
Baltimore, ‘‘the extraordinarily high rates
of hospitalization of Negroes in. . . Baltimore are almost certainly due to the inability of the community and the family, particularly, to care for the individuals at home.
I think this accounts for our finding that the
rate of psychoses in the noninstitutionalized Negro is extraordinarily
low...” (p. 362).

Nor do the problems with relying on
treated rates end there. We are in a time of
change with regard to the settings in which
psychiatric treatment is provided. Thus,
not only may recruitment to inpatient and
outpatient psychiatric services in general be
changing, but also traffic among these services. For these reasons, the meaning of a
hospital admission rate relative to true rates
is probably changing even as we try to interpret it.

The evidence certainly does not lead us
to conclude that epidemiologic studies of
schizophrenia based on treated rates alone
will necessarily yield the same results as
studies designed to assess true rates of cases

Social Biology

in the community. For this reason we base
our review of epidemiological investigations of schizophrenia on studies that have
not relied solely on cases admitted to treatment. Our strategy will be to look at trends
in treated rates as a check where the information yielded by studies that include untreated cases is sparse.

RATES OF SCHIZOPHRENIA FROM
“TRUE” PREVALENCE STUDIES

Since the turn of the century, some 58
different investigators or teams of investigators in different parts of the world have
attempted to count not only treated cases
but also untreated cases of psychiatric disorder (Dohrenwend and Dohrenwend,
1974). Dating from 1917, these studies
were conducted in America, in Europe, in
Asia, and in Africa. Typically, the whole
population in a specified geographical area
was included. In the few investigations that
relied on estimates, the sample size was
usually large; for example, probability samples of 1,660 in the Midtown Manhattan
Study (Srole et al., 1962) and 1,010 in a
study of a rural county in Canada that was
called “Stirling’(D. C. Leighton et al.,
1963).

In most of the studies, the rates represent prevalence during a period of a few
months to a few years, that is, number of
current cases regardless of time of onset.
Most of the exceptions presented lifetime
prevalence rates—studies by B6bk (1953),
Dube (1968), Helgason (1964), Lin (1953),
Rin and Lin (1962), Str6mgren (1938), and
a summary by Strémgren (1950) of 18 small
studies in the same general geographical
area, counted as one study in our analyses.
In addition, Hagnell (1966) reported the incidence rate for a reported ten-year period,
that is, the number of new cases that developed during this period.

We found in an earlier analysis that the
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

Vol. 26, No. 2

prevalence rates reported for the sum of all
disorders in these studies ranged from 4 per
1,000 to 690 per 1,000 (Dohrenwend and
Dohrenwend, 1974). Our inquiry into what
could account for variation of such magnitude produced a series of disconcerting
answers. It was not possible to explain the
differences on substantive grounds. There
were, for example, no consistent
differences in prevalence rates according to
the geopolitical area of the world in which
the study was done, nor according to
whether the study site was rural or urban.
Nor could we find consistent differences in
total rates of disorder according to sex or
age. Rather, the variability was found to be
related to differences in thoroughness of
data collection procedures and, even more,
to contrasting concepts of what constituted
a case of psychiatric disorder. Thus, for example, in the studies published before
1950, the median total prevalence rate of all
disorders is 21 per 1,000 with a range of 8
per 1,000 to 90 per 1,000; by contrast, the
median of studies published in 1950 or later
is 156 per 1,000 with a range of 4 per 1,000
to 690 per 1,000. The wide ranges in rates
within each of the two time periods suggest
that the increase in the median is far less a
function of changes in the times in which we
live than it is a function of changes in some
of the nomenclatures following the psychiatric screening experience of World War II
when psychiatrists found many cases did
not fit clinical categories (e.g., American
Psychiatric Association Committee on Nomenclature and Statistics, 1952).

Thirty-five of the “true” prevalence
studies reported rates for diagnosed cases
of schizophrenia. In addition, four studies,
although they discldimed making
diagnoses, reported rates of symptom patterns judged to be of schizophrenic type
(Gillis et al., 1965; Langner and Michael,
1963; A. H. Leighton et al., 1963; and D.
C. Leighton et al., 1963).

 

Epidemiology of Schizophrenia 145

As Table 2 shows, the reported rates of
schizophrenia range from a low of zero to
49.0 per 1,000 in these “true” prevalence
studies or, if we are unwilling to count the
four studies reporting symptom patterns of
schizophrenic type rather that actual
diagnoses of schizophrenia, zero to 26.8 per
1,000. The median rate for these studies is
3.8 per 1,000.

Thus, again we have a picture of great
variability in rates. And again, as Table 2
shows, this variability is not accounted for
by differences in the geopolitical area in
which the study was done or by whether the
study site was rural or urban. Instead, as for
the summed rates for all disorders, the variability can be traced to problems in
methods and procedures rather than to substantive factors that differentiate the populations studied. Thus, the median rate of
schizophrenia for the studies published before 1950 is 2.9 per 1,000 with a range of 1.9
to 6.4 per 1,000. By contrast, the median
rate for schizophrenia in the studies
published in or after 1950 is three times as
large, 5.8 per 1,000, with a range of zero to
49.0 per 1,000. In all likelihood, the higher
median reflects both a trend toward expanded concepts of what constitutes schizophrenia and greater thoroughness in data
collection procedures in the later studies,
which more often than earlier studies involved interviews with all subjects (Dohrenwend and Dohrenwend, 1969, pp. 96-97).

For further clarification, let us turn to a
clinical genetic study designed to focus on
the question of how different concepts of
schizophrenia affect the number of cases
found. This study was done at Maudsley
Hospital in London and used schizophrenics and their twins as subjects (Gottesman and Shields, 1972). Six diagnosticians of varying theoretical persuasions
were used to derive a consensus diagnosis,
and a Scandinavian view was obtained from
Essen-Moller (cf. 1956) in Sweden. Subse

lected to illustrate the effect of varying individual criteria on the frequency of diagnosing the presence of schizophrenia in an
extensively studied sample of 114 twins.
The two Scandinavian psychiatrists, when
operating within a traditional continental
European framework, had the lowest yield
of schizophrenic diagnoses, and one of
these two, when he employed the criteria
for the spectrum of schizophrenia disorders, had the highest.

We cannot and should not attempt to
specify at this time which definition of schizophrenia is correct. It is critical, however,
that we be explicit and precise about what
definition is being used in a given study so
that the results can be interpreted and related to those of other studies.

In working with rates or ratios we must
be confident not only that we understand
what went into the numerator, but also that
we have used the appropriate denominator
for the purpose of the study. To illustrate,
Yolles and Kramer (1969), summarizing
various prevalence rates for schizophrenia
in the literature, reported a lifetime prevalence from the study of Essen-Moéller
(1956) in rural southern Sweden of 6.7 per
1,000 population (Table 2). Essen-MOller

himself and other psychiatric geneticists (e.g., Zerbin-Riidin, 1967) reported a lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia of
11.2 per 1,000 for the very same study. The
discrepancy stems from the difference in
use to which the rates are put, and both
schools of thought are correct for their own
purposes. The testing and fitting of genetic
models requires an age-corrected rate that
uses a denominator of risk-lives observed.
Yolles and Kramer considered the denominator of the total Essen-Moller sample,
2,950, while genetic investigators calculated that this sample yielded only 1,515
risk-lives. Both used the same numerator of
the number of actual schizophrenic cases.
Such gaps in communication retard the advancement of research on schizophrenia.
Given the problems of variation in
diagnostic criteria and, to a lesser extent, of
the base used to calculate rates, we should
not look for accurate absolute estimates of
the true prevalence of schizophrenia in the
population in general or in particular subgroups from available epidemiologic
studies. What we can determine is whether
there are consistencies in the relative rates
reported for subgroups within studies; for
instance, whether men are consistently reDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

148

ported to have higher rates than women, or
vice versa. For our present purpose we will
make these comparisons within studies to
answer three questions: Does the rate of
schizophrenia differ for men and women?
Is the rate highest at a particular age? How
does the rate of schizophrenia vary with social class?

There are no consistent differences in
prevalence rates of schizophrenia according to sex (Dohrenwend and Dohrenwend,
1976), nor is there any consistency in the
age at which the highest prevalence is
found, except that the highest prevalence
was never reported for subjects under 20
years of age. These inconsistent results for
age are not surprising, however, given the
persistent nature of many cases and the varjation in the age composition of the population studied. Even if the age of onset were
consistently early, as it is generally believed
to be, incidence rather than prevalence rates would be needed to detect this type of
consistency.

Eight true-prevalence community
studies provided data on the distribution of
cases of schizophrenia by social class. These
eight studies range in time of execution
from the 1930’s to the 1960’s. One study
was located in the United States (Langner
and Michael, 1963); four studies were in
Western Europe (Bremer, 1951; Brugger,
1931, 1933; Helgason, 1964); and three
studies were in Asia (Akimoto et al., 1942;
Lin, 1953; Tsuwaga et al., 1942). Of these
eight studies, six reported the highest rate
of schizophrenia in the lowest social class.
The two exceptions were Japanese studies
done before World War II (Akimoto et al.,
1942; Tsuwaga et al., 1942).

Since the number of studies that relate
to social class is small, the evidence for this
relationship would be strengthened if investigations of treated cases were found to
yield the same trend. The literature indicates that our finding that the true preva
Dohrenwend et al.

Social Biology

lence rate of schizophrenia tends to be
highest in the lowest social class 1s consistent with the results of most studies of hospital first admission rates (Mishler and
Scotch, 1965, p. 268), though not all
(Kohn, 1973).

To summarize the findings of epidemiologic research, rates of schizophrenia
quite consistently show an inverse relation
with social class and show no consistent relationship with sex or age. If we are to find
clues to the etiology of schizophrenia in
the cumulative results of epidemiologic
studies to date, then, the firmest empirical
starting point is the finding that the highest
rate of schizophrenia is most often reported in the lowest social class (cf. Kohn,
1973).

Turning now from past research to the
future, we find that advances in the study
of etiological issues will depend on testing
appropriate genotype-by-environment
models that are, as a minimum, consistent
with the twin, family, adoption, and psychiatric epidemiologic data. Tests of the
models require, aS a minimum, accurate
prevalence and incidence data. One example of testing the compatibility of a
great deal of pooled family and twin data
with some kind of polygenic-threshold
model of transmission, wherein the genes
are necessary but not sufficient, is provided in Figure 1. Based on pooled or representative risks of schizophrenia of 50 per
cent to identical cotwins, 46 per cent to the
offspring born to two schizophrenics,
about 10 per cent to siblings including fraternal cotwins, and 3 per cent to seconddegree relatives of schizophrenics (such as
grandparents, aunts, etc.), values of the
‘heritability to the liability” of developing
schizophrenia are generated on the vertical axis. In this model derived from the
work of Falconer and Charles Smith in
Edinburgh, the values are critically dependent on the population lifetime risk
one chooses as the most accurate. It is only

when the value is close to 1 per cent that
we get a coalescence or compatibility of
the empirical data with one particular
heritability value and that value is about
85 per cent. As we know, such high values
of heritability of liability cannot be
equated with rigid determinism or with
lack of influence of environmental contributors to liability. Witness the high
heritability of height and its modifiability
by changes in pre- and postnatal nutrition
as well as psychological-emotional environment. An important next step in
these kinds of model-fitting approaches
will require social-class—specific values of
the risks to the kinds of relatives shown in
Figure 1.

In order to develop the necessary data,
psychiatric epidemiologists will have to
solve two major technical problems. The
first derives from the rarity of schizophrenia in the general population. In order to
obtain reliable estimates of rates for
specific types of relatives within social
class, we will need to work with large samples constructed so that schizophrenics
have not been selectively removed by hospitalization or early death. At the same
time, in order to avoid further proliferation of studies whose rates vary as a function of different implicit clinical traditions
of definition and diagnosis, the
identification of cases of schizophrenia in
the community will have to be done in
terms of explicit concepts and decision
rules. Given the primitive state of our understanding of the phenomena that we call
schizophrenia, these rules should probably be inclusive rather than exclusive and
include provision for differentiating subtypes of schizophrenia. This means that
the concepts and rules of identification
and classification cannot help but be complex. It will, therefore, require considerable training and skill to apply them reliably.

What we seem to require of future epi
 

Social Biology

demiologic studies, then, is a two-stage
procedure in which a large number of persons are screened with an instrument that
errs in the direction of false positives, and
the relatively small number of persons
thus screened are interviewed by research
diagnosticians who are trained to apply an
explicit set of decision rules reliably. Fortunately, we are now at the point where
the tools necessary to execute this twostage procedure are becoming available.
For screening we have the Psychiatric Epidemiology Research Interview, a closedquestion self-report instrument which has
yielded satisfactory results in ethnically
heterogeneous community and patient
groups (Dohrenwend, Oksenberg et al.,
ms.; Dohrenwend, Shrout et al., ms.). For
diagnosis according to explicit criteria we
have at least two candidates. One is the
Present State Examination, developed at
the Maudsley Hospital and used in crosscultural studies of schizophrenic patients
by the World Health Organization (Wing
et al., 1974). The other is the Schedule for
Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia
(Endicott and Spitzer, 1978), now coming
into widespread use in psychiatric research in the United States.

In summary, there now exists a broad
consensus that both genes and social environment are important in the etiology of
schizophrenia. There is controversy, however, about the relative importance of the
two sets of factors and about how they interact. Data from twin and adoption
studies have demonstrated that genetic
factors play a part, and data from epidemiologic investigations have suggested
which of a variety of social factors may be
most important to investigate further. A
model such as the one set forth earlier illustrates how the two sets of findings
might be used as a platform for investigation of the actual nature of geneenvironment interaction in the causation
of schizophrenia.

Until fairly recently, such research involving large samples of subjects from the
general population would have seemed
impractical. Not only are large scale epidemiologic studies expensive, but the
problems of accurate case identification
and classification have seemed insurmountable, given the lack of agreement
about how to define schizophrenia and
measure its characteristics.

There is no way that large scale epidemiologic investigations can be done both
cheaply and well. Major advances in
measurement procedures, however, suggest that they can be done far better than
in the past and, within the framework of
two-stage identification and classification
procedures, with a degree of economy.
The prospects look good for collaboration

Epidemiology of Schizophrenia 131

in epidemiologic studies between environmentally oriented and genetically
oriented investigators concerned with understanding the causes of schizophrenia.
