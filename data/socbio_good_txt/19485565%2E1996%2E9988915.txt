ABSTRACT: A comprehensive model of family influences on educational resemblance of siblings
expands the traditional sibling pair model to a full sibship model in order to investigate how
gender, gender composition of sibships, and a measure of ordinal position moderate the effect
of social origins on educational attainments of siblings. One common family factor is sufficient
to explain the variation of educational attainment among brothers and sisters. Although effects
of social origin variables on brothers are larger than on sisters, the relative effects of measured
social origins are virtually the same among sisters and brothers. The disparity between educational attainments of brothers and sisters persists across sex composition and family size. Ordinal
position does not alter the effects of social origins on educational attainment nor does it directly
affect educational attainment. Father’s and mother’s education are equally important for all
siblings regardless of birth order, gender composition, and family size.

ent effects of common family background on status attainment of members of the same sibship, for example,
differences between brothers and sisters in the effect of social origins on
educational attainment.

Benin and Johnson (1984) reported
that social origins had larger effects on
the educational attainments of sisters
than on those of brothers in two small
Nebraska samples, but Hauser and
Wong’s (1989) reanalysis of the Nebraska data showed that the gender
differences were explained by the
lower variability in women’s schooling.
That is, invariant effects of background
on the schooling of brothers and sisters
explained a larger share of the variance
in women’s schooling because there
was less variance in sisters’ than in
brothers’ schooling within families.

Previous studies have also examined
variation in the effects of social background by relative ordinal position
within sibling pairs.! In some populations, the effect of family background
on educational attainment has been
less among younger than among older
siblings (Hauser and Wong, 1989;
Dronkers, 1988), but in others there
has been no birth order difference in
the effect of family background (De
Graaf and Huinink, 1992; Hsueh,
1992).

These findings are incomplete.
Family environment includes all ele
1These studies have contrasted effects of family
background on older and younger siblings within
each possible pair of siblings; thus, they do not pertain to effects of birth order, strictly defined. Because of the very large number of combinations of
birth order and gender within large sibships, it is
very difficult to use a strict definition of birth order
in these analyses. Throughout this analysis, we have
followed a similar convention. Our references to
“birth order” actually pertain to relative ordinal position among siblings of the same gender.

ments of family configuration, but the
limitation of analyses to sibling pairs
ignores some possible effects, e.g., that
of the gender composition of the sibship or those of specific positions in
the birth order. Here, we employ a
data set with information on educa
tional attainment in full sibships to

model the resemblance among siblings
and look for some effects of family
configuration.

SIBLING RESEMBLANCE
MODELS: METHODOLOGICAL
ISSUES

The distinct advantage of the sibling
resemblance model is methodological.
The unit of analysis in the classical status attainment model is an individual in
the general population (Blau and Duncan, 1967), so the model cannot properly specify either within-family or
between-family effects. For example,
effects of birth order are typically estimated in samples of persons from
different families, rather than from
the same family, so birth order may
be confounded with other, betweenfamily effects. In the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS), variations in
educational attainment by birth order
were far different in full sibships than
among the original respondents who
graduated from high school in 1957
(Hauser and Sewell, 1985, pp. 9-11).

At the same time, as noted by
Bowles (1972), because individual data
do not allow the complete specification
of the relevant social background of individuals, existing estimates of the role
of schooling in the intergenerational
transfer of economic status may be biased upward. That is, no matter how

many social background variables—
paternal and maternal schooling, occupation, income, race, region, etc.—
one puts into a model, some relevant
common family factors are probably
left out.

By specifying one or more common,

unmeasured family factors, a model of.

sibling resemblance can meet this criticism. However, problems of unreliable measurement loom larger in such
models (Hauser and Mossel, 1985;
Hauser and Mossel, 1987), and other
omitted variable problems remain. For
example, a within-family regression
of occupational status on educational
attainment may be biased upward if
ability is not controlled.

Olneck (1976, 1977, 1979) has applied sibling resemblance models with
a latent common family factor to data
from the 1962 Occupational Changes
in a Generation Survey (OCG) and
from his survey of Kalamazoo brothers, and he finds relatively small biases
in the effects of educational attainment
on occupational status and earnings.
Similarly, using Wisconsin sibling data,
Hauser and Mossel (1985, 1987) have
found little family bias in the effect
of educational attainment on occupational status, and Hauser and Sewell
(1986) reconfirmed these findings,
both in the Wisconsin and Kalamazoo
data, while extending the Wisconsin
findings to include earnings as well as
occupational status. However, these
analyses have been limited to similarities between pairs of brothers.

SEX DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SIBLINGS

Although brother pairs are sufficient to identify models of sibling resemblance, it is necessary to estimate
models among pairs of sisters or of

mixed sex in order to increase the generality of previous findings and to look
for effects of gender and birth order.
By comparing the residual covariances
between siblings’ educations across
groups of sibling pairs that differ in
gender and birth order composition,
Benin and Johnson (1984) argued that
brother pairs resemble one another
more than do sister pairs or brothersister pairs. Through role-modeling
and facilitation, they argued, like-sex
siblings would influence one another
more than opposite-sex siblings, and
older brothers would have more influence than older sisters. Thus, pairs of
older and younger brothers should
show the greatest resemblance, net of
social background, while pairs of older
sisters and younger brothers should
show the least resemblance.

Benin and Johnson’s analysis of two
Nebraska sibling samples suffers from
methodological and substantive problems (Hauser and Wong, 1989, pp.
152-156). First, a common family factor is not specified in their model, but
only in their verbal proposition. Their
analysis was actually based on unrestricted regressions of educational attainment on social background in each
sibling group. Second, Benin and
Johnson’s evidence was both inappropriate and weak. Their cross-group
comparisons among residual covariances could not support their argument
about “‘cross-sibling effects,” because
the covariances are irrelevant to the
identification of cross-sibling effects.

Hauser and Wong (1989, pp. 156160) reanalyzed the Nebraska data
jusing a MIMIC (multiple-indicator,
multiple-cause) model and found that
the differences in residual covariances

der composition were insignificant, excepting a low level of resemblance
among pairs of older sisters and
younger brothers. They also analyzed
Dutch and German sibling samples and
found no evidence to support the Nebraska findings. Finally, they analyzed
data for Kalamazoo brother pairs, using academic ability and achievement
as instrumental variables, and they directly estimated reciprocal influences
of brothers’ educational attainments.
While Benin and Johnson had assumed
a predominant flow of influence from
older to younger siblings, and Hauser
and Wong found this pattern in the
Kalamazoo data, their estimate was
not significantly larger than the reverse
effect from younger to older brothers.

Because the data were limited to
pairs of brothers, Hauser and Wong’s
analysis of the Kalamazoo data could
not address differences in cross-sibling
effects between like-sex and oppositesex pairs. To address this limitation,
Lee (1989) analyzed groups of sibling
pairs drawn from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, where the groups of
pairs were constructed as by Benin and
Johnson. She estimated a model similar to that of Hauser and Wong, but she
used measured ability alone as an instrumental variable to estimate crosssibling influence. Her analysis was limited to a subsample of about 2,000 pairs
in the WLS data in which test score
data had been collected, and the sibling had been interviewed directly. The
subsampling design, when combined
with survey and item nonresponse of

In this analysis, we specify only reduced-form
models of the effects of social origins on schooling.
In principle, these effects could be extended to include cross-sibling effects in the manner of Hauser
and Wong (1989).

Educational Attainment 101

both the original respondent and the
sibling, led to a substantial loss of statistical power. Lee found no reciprocal
effects between older siblings and the
younger brother, but positive reciprocal effects between older siblings and
the younger sister. A common family
factor had the same effect on all sibling
pairs, except the all-sister pair. Finally,
the effect of measured ability on a
brother’s educational attainment was
significantly larger than its effect on a
sister’s attainment.

FAMILY CONFIGURATION

When we use data for sibling pairs
from sibships with different gender
compositions, the effect of gender is
confounded with effects of other elements of family configuration. First,
among randomly selected pairs of siblings, we cannot distinguish the effect
of birth order from that of gender in a
mixed-sex pair. Second, the likelihood
of choosing a pair of brothers in a random sample is, of course, higher for
families with sibships with more brothers, while the opposite holds true for
sister pairs. Thus, differences among
brother pairs, sister pairs, and brothersister pairs may result from the differences in the size and gender composition of sibships or from differences in
ordinal position.

FAMILY SIZE AND BIRTH ORDER

Many studies focus on the effect of
birth order and family size on intelligence, personality traits, or educational outcomes. Most early work had
two serious flaws: use of small samples
not selected from the general population and a failure to control other variables of family configuration which are

102 Kuo and Hauser

confounded with sibling position
(Adams, 1972). Since the 1970’s, there
have been new theories of birth-order
and family-size effects, along with better data and research designs.

The confluence theory, proposed by
Zajonc and Markus (1975; Zajonc,
1976), argues that the quality of the intellectual environment of a given child
is a complex function of the intelligence of other family members and
consequent opportunities to learn from
and teach other siblings. Short birth intervals and a large family have negative
effects on the average intellectual environment of a child. Even though the
intellectual environment of the only
child or last child is relatively high,
because other family members have
higher intelligence than s/he has, the
absence of a chance to teach younger
siblings depresses intellectual development.

Lindert (1977) argues that when
birth spacing is controlled, the investment of parental resources, e.g., time
and money, in a child varies by birth
order and thus influences the child’s
achievement. Because of the absence
of other competing children, firstborn, last-born, and only children do
better than other children in the family, and this difference decreases with
closer birth spacing. The argument is
known as resource dilution theory. The
theory explains the findings of Blau
and Duncan’s (1967) study using sib
3Several studies evaluating the confluence theory have failed to confirm Zajonc et al.’s (1975,
1976) findings. Zajonc and his colleagues have attributed their failure to wrong methods and data,
but we believe that evidence strongly favors the critics of the conference theory. See Steelman (1985,
1986) versus Zajonc (1986) and Retherford and
Sewell (1991, 1992) versus Zajonc et al. (1991).

ling data from the 1962 Occupational
Changes in a Generation (OCG) survey. First-born and last-born men in
large families (with 3 or more siblings)
have greater educational and occupational attainments than their brothers
in the middle of the sibship. Lindert’s
own study, based on a sample of 1,087
siblings from a nonrandom sample of
New Jersey executives (Hermalin,
1969), confirmed this linkage between
sibling position and education.

After Lindert, there has been no
strong and consistent empirical support of birth order effects on educational and occupational attainment.
Wright (1977) used 1962 OCG data to
test the confluence and resource dilution theories, and her regression analysis supports neither of them. She
found a small effect of birth order only
on educational attainment, and this
tendency increases with sibship size for
last-born children. Similarly, Olneck
and Bills (1979) found no support for
either the confluence theory or the
resource dilution theory in analyses
of the Kalamazoo brother data. They
conclude that the family-size effect
persists.net of the effect of socioeconomic background, but the birth-order
effect disappears when brothers are
compared with one another.

Examining 1975 Wisconsin high
school graduates and their siblings,
Hauser and Sewell (1985) found a substantial negative effect of sibship size,
but no significant or systematic effects
of birth order on schooling when social
origins were controlled. When family
size 1s controlled, years of schooling increase with birth order. However, the
gain of schooling coincides with intercohort gains of educational attainment
in the general population between 1930

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

Vol. 43, No. 1-2

and 1950. They conclude that there are
virtually no birth-order effects.

Powell and Steelman (1990) analyzed data from the High School and
Beyond survey and found that closer
spacing strengthens the negative effect
of sibship size. However, their failure
to control for birth order, which is one
of the concerns of the confluence
model and resource dilution theory,
confounds the effects of other family
configuration variables with those of
birth order, including the disproportionate occurrence of lower birth orders in a sample of the general population.

GENDER COMPOSITION

Gender composition is another important characteristic of family configuration. Brim (1958) found that the
gender composition of siblings in a
two-child family influenced the personality traits of both children. Because
the sample is limited to two-child families, Brim cautions against the application of his findings to siblings from
families of other sizes.

There are two theories to illustrate
the process of influence: role models
and role expectations. The former argues that parents and siblings of the
same gender serve as role models for a
child; that is, a child assimilates his or
her behaviors to the parent or sibling of
the same gender. On the other hand,
role expectation theory suggests that a
child interacts with others according to
others’ (social) expectations of his/her
behaviors, and siblings on both sides of
the interaction are aware of the expectations overtly or covertly. Thus, a setting with all other siblings of the same
sex is different from the setting with all
other siblings of the opposite sex.

 

Educational Attainment

103

Lee’s (1989) findings are consistent
with the role expectation theory: The
traditional female role is submissive
and passive to authority, the older siblings. Thus, the younger sister rather
than the younger brother is influenced
by older siblings, and the expectation
is mutual. In Powell and Steelman
(1990), two variables are constructed
to represent gender composition: one
is number of brothers, and the other
is number of sisters. The number of
brothers has a negative effect on children’s educational achievement, and
that of sisters has an inconsistent effect.4

Taken as a whole, most of the available evidence shows that the effects of
social origins on brothers and sisters
are very similar. One exception is
Lee’s finding that sisters are less influenced by family background than their
brothers. The question of reciprocal influence between siblings remains unresolved, and the present analysis will
not attempt to provide further evidence about it. There is no consistent
evidence of effects of birth order on
educational attainment, and there has
been no definitive test of the effect of
gender composition of sibships on educational attainment.

In this paper, our goal is to look
more closely at effects of social origins
on educational attainment in reducedform models, using the identifying information in data from full sibships to
provide new evidence about the factorial structure of measured social background and schooling and stronger
evidence about differences in family

4However, Powell and Steelman did not test
whether the effects of number of brothers and of
number of sisters were significantly different from
one another.

background effects by gender, gender
composition, birth order, and size of
sibship. We begin by asking whether
there is more than one common family
factor in the educational attainment of
siblings, and whether those factors may
differ between brothers and sisters.

ONE-FACTOR AND TWo-FACTOR
MODELS OF SIBLING RESEMBLANCE

If there were different effects of social origins on brothers and sisters,
then there might, but need not be, two
distinct family factors in the educational attainments of sisters and brothers.5 A one-factor model is identified
with only one measured background
variable in a set of sibling pairs whose
educational attainments are known,
and it is thus possible to distinguish
between-family variation from withinfamily variation. With a second measured background variable, a single
factor model can be rejected (Hauser
and Goldberger, 1971), but in an analysis of sibling pairs it may not be clear
whether the rejection could be explained by sex differences in the effect
of background. However, with two or
more background variables and measures of a single outcome for each
member of sibships larger than two, it
is possible both to reject a one-factor
model and to determine whether sex

5Chamberlain and Griliches (1977) suggested a
two-factor model of sibling resemblance in earnings
among the young men in the National Longitudinal
Survey of Labor Market Experience, who were 14
to 24 years old in 1966, Because they used sibling
pair data, they had to impose arbitrary identifying
constraints to identify their model. Our model is less
restrictive because we observe full sibships. Also,
we are interested in differences in the effect of family background between brothers and sisters, while
Chamberlain and Griliches (1977) were attempting
to identify multiple family factors in the achievement of brothers.

differences account for the emergence
of a second factor.

Without loss of generality, consider
the case of two social background variables, €, and &,, and sibling outcomes,
Nis Na» +++» Nm» Where Ny, Nz. --+> Mme

will satisfy the constraints,
Mi =WMWi-  =Umninry (2)

This model can be rejected with as few
as two background variables and an
outcome for two siblings. However, rejection of the model does not tell us,
for example, whether there is a consistent difference in 7; ,/m;. between
brothers and sisters, nor can it tell us
whether the gender composition of the
sibship affects the ratios of the reduced
form coefficients.

Rejection of the constraint on the
ratios of reduced-form coefficients in
Equation 2 need not imply that similar
constraints do not hold for subgroups
of siblings. For example, let x, and x,
be the ratios of reduced-form coefficients among sisters and brothers. It
could be that |

where %, ~x,, which says that a proportionality constraint holds among
sisters and among brothers, but the
two constraints are not the same. For
example, the effect of education of the
same-sex parent may be larger than
that of the opposite-sex parent, both
among brothers and among sisters. In
this situation, a one-factor model of
family background would be rejected
in full sibships, even though it would
hold for sibling pairs that were homogeneous in gender composition.®

Note that Equation 2 does not imply
that the effect of the background variables is the same for brothers and
sisters. For example, suppose that
Ti1 = Vi1 and Xz. = y,2 for ism*,
while =; = Y;, 14, and 1,2 = y, 2A, for
i > m*, In this case, the model of
Equation 2 should not be rejected, but
the effect of social background is either
uniformly more or less for sisters or
brothers, depending on the value of A,.
That is, for any sister, s, or brother, b,

Ns = Yi S1+ V1.2 & + &;
Nb = V1.1 Ay &1 + Yi2 A» &2 + Ep (4)

and the effects of background differ by

Up to this point, our reference to
one- and two-factor models pertains
only to the number of factors required
to describe the effects of social background variables on educational attainment. That is, we have ignored the covariance structure of the disturbances

°If x, ~ x, in Equation 3, then the model could

that could not in itself tell us whether gender differences were responsible because gender and birth

(€) in individual educational attainment. If there are two or more family
background variables, it would be possible, in sibships of three or more, to
reject the hypothesis that there is a single common factor in educational attainment, even when there is only one
common family background factor.

For example, consider the following
model of attainment, where &, and &,
are social background variables; y,, y>,
and y3 are the educational attainments
of three siblings; €,, 2, and €3 are disturbances in attainment; and n, is a
common family factor:

MN = Yu &1 + Y2 &
y=mt &
Yo = Ag Ni + €2 (5)
Y3 = Agi 11 + 3

where we normalize the coefficients by
setting A,,; = 1. This model is overidentified with two restrictions, even
if we place no constraints on 0*, =
cov(€;,€;). However, if we respecify the
mode] to introduce an unmeasured
common family factor, C,, so

N= Yu 61+ Y2G& +S, (6)

where 0°, = 0°,, = 0®,, = 0, then the
model forces y, both to mediate all
effects of social background and to
account for the covariances among
the siblings’ educational attainments,
which adds two more over-identifying
restrictions, relative to the model of
Equation 5. Thus, one could reject the
hypothesis that the family background
factor accounts entirely for the covariances among siblings’ levels of completed schooling, even when there is a
single family background factor. We
will also test this stronger version of the
single-factor model.

OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS

In the next section, we introduce the
full sibship data from the Wisconsin
Longitudinal Study and describe the
variables used in this analysis (See figure 1). Then, we introduce a multiplegroup factor model of schooling in
order to carry out one test of the hypothesis that there is more than one
common factor in siblings’ educational
attainments. Next, we add_ social
background variables and specify a
multiple-group Multiple-Indicator-andMultiple-Cause (MIMIC) model of
schooling. This model permits a second
test of the one-factor hypothesis,
against the alternative that more than
one factor is required to mediate the
effects of social background on schooling. We have, also, refined this model
to specify differences in the effect of
social origins by gender and birth order. Then, we present estimates of several parameters for sibships of size 3, 4,
and 5: effects of exogenous variables,
variances of shared unmeasured family
background, and nonshared variances
of siblings’ educational attainments by
gender.

In the next section, we expand this
model to contrast the one-factor hypothesis with a specific alternative,
namely, that the family background

factors differ between brothers and

sisters. Finally, we estimate effects of
birth order and gender composition on
mean levels of educational attainment.
In the final section, we summarize our
findings.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The Wisconsin Longitudinal Study
(WLS) began with a survey of all highschool seniors in Wisconsin’s class of

 

Social Biology

1957. Later, one-third of the original
respondents were selected at random
for further study. In 1964, a brief
follow-up was conducted by mailing
parents a postcard questionnaire in order to update the social and economic
situation of 1957 respondents. In 1975,
the original respondents were interviewed by telephone in a_ second
follow-up, which collected information
about social background, occupation,
education, marriage, children, and social activities. Data on age, sex, and
educational attainment were collected
for all living siblings of the respondent.
At the same time, one sibling was randomly selected from each full sibship
roster. In 1977, a subsample of about
2,000 of the selected siblings were interviewed, using essentially the same
questionnaire as in 1975. Most of the
previous studies of sibling resemblance
in the WLS have used only data for
this subsample of sibling pairs (Hauser
and Mossel, 1985, 1987; Hauser, 1984,
1988; Hauser and Wong, 1989; Lee,
1989). Hauser and Sewell (1985) used
the WLS sibling rosters to study the
effects of birth order on levels of educational attainment, but they did not
attempt to model sibling resemblance.

We use the WLS data here because
they contain the educational attainment of all siblings of the primary
respondents who were living in 1975.
To test the two-factor model, data for
more than two siblings are needed for
model identification. To investigate effects of family configuration, data from
full sibship rosters permit us to map
the effects of birth order and gender
composition. It is well established that
the educational data from the WLS
are highly reliable, both for the original respondents and for their siblings

(Hauser et al., 1983; Hauser and
Mossel, 1985, 1987). Also, because the
WLS data have been used extensively
in previous studies of sibling resemblance, we can easily compare our results with previous findings.

Table 1 shows the distribution of
sibship size and the gender composition of 9,081 WLS respondents in the
1975 survey who reported their numbers of siblings.” Sixty-two per cent of
respondents have 2 or more siblings.
Almost half of respondents who answer the sibling roster have 2 to 4 siblings; that is, 49 per cent of the sample

is from sibships of size 3, 4, or 5. Note
that, even in sibships of 5 or 6 persons,
the number of families (of original respondents) with all boys or all girls is
quite small. We start the analyses with
sibship size 3, which is the minimum
sibship size needed to identify the twofactor model. Owing to the wide range
of siblings’ ages, we limit our analysis
to siblings aged 21 to 55 in 1975. This
limitation may eliminate some effects
of wide birth spacing, but it also eliminates persons who probably had not
completed their schooling or who were
unlikely to be biological siblings of the
original respondents. Finally, we have

sibship size 5. These numbers represent 90 per cent of the original respondents in sibship size 3; 81 per cent in
sibship size 4; and 76 per cent in sibship
size 5, We have not included sibships of
6 or more in this analysis because of the
small number of observations in many
of the gender combinations.

We have defined subgroups and endogenous variables for the analysis by
the gender composition of the sibship
and by the arrangement of relative
birth order within sex. We first group
the sample of each sibship size by gender composition. Thus, there are four
subgroups for sibship size 3, five for
sibship size 4, and six for sibship size 5.
Next, we divide siblings in each group
by sex, and within each sex, place them
by the ascending order of birth, 1.e.,
from the oldest to the youngest. For
example, in a two-sister sibship of size
four, the order is the oldest sister, the
youngest sister, the oldest brother, and

the youngest brother. Thus, our design
does not identify effects of birth order,
per se, but only of relative ordinal position within same-sex siblings, except
in the case of all-female or all-male sibships. We use this simplified specification of birth order because of the very
large number of possible combinations
of birth order with gender composition. Figure 2 gives the example of our
model for sibship size 4.

Table 2 gives means and standard
deviations of the measured endogenous variables, that is, the years of
schooling of siblings, by size of sibship
(vertical panel), gender (horizontal
panels), and relative birth order (rows
within horizontal panels). Thus, in allmale sibships of size 3, shown in the
first column of the table, the mean
years of schooling completed are 13.87
for first-born sons, 13.68 for secondborn sons, and 13.62 for last-born sons.

sister, the mean sister’s education is
13.30 years, while the mean schooling
levels are just below 14 years both for
older and younger brothers. Our design does not distinguish among the
three possible ordinal positions of the
sister in this configuration.

Inspection of Table 2 suggests the
consistency of the data with previous
findings. Siblings from smaller families
finish more schooling, and within family sizes and configurations, men usually finish more schooling than women.
Also, there is consistently less variability in the schooling of sisters than of
brothers. There is no clear pattern to
educational attainment by birth order
or relative birth order, although there
is a hint of a positive relationship between birth order and schooling among
gender-homogeneous sibships of size
5. With one exception (in sibship size
5), the education of sisters in families
with only one daughter is larger than
the education of sisters in all other sibling configurations of the same size,
but this effect, if any, is quite small.

The exogenous variables include
family income (in thousands of dollars), father’s and mother’s education
(in years), father’s occupational status
(Duncan SEI score), Catholic upbringing, and farm background.

RESULTS
Factor MopDELs

Our strategy for the comparison between two-factor and one-factor models, first, is to test the multiple-group
factor model with one common family
factor. Second, we report analyses of
the effects of family configuration in

Educational Attainment 111

the one-factor MIMIC model.® Third,
we evaluate the findings in the first two
sections by developing and testing a
two-factor MIMIC model of educational attainment. The equation of the
single factor model of educational attainment is

X=ATE+6 (7)

where X is a vector of siblings’ educational attainments; — is the common
family factor; A* is the matrix of loadings of X’s on &; and 4 is a vector of
unmeasured unique factors. In matrix
form, the model is?
Xk vt od
XK2 k,2,1 k2
x3] | Ana Ei] + 543 (8)
Nic at 8x4
where k indexes groups defined by gender composition, e.g., the five distinct
groups in sibships of size 4. We report
the test statistics in Table 3.

The baseline specification, Model A
in Table 3, is a one-factor model in
which the effect of one common family
factor on educational attainment of
brothers differs from that of sisters,
and the within-family variance in
schooling also differs between brothers
and sisters. In all other respects, the
parameters of the model are invariant.
They do not differ by gender composition of sibship or by birth order

8In addition to L7, we use the bic statistic to evaluate goodness of fit. The bic statistic is based on
Bayesian theory for a posteriori tests: bic =
L? — df x In(N), where df are the degrees of freedom under the tested model or contrast, and N is the
sample size. Satisfactory fit is indicated by a negative value of bic, and models with lower bic statistics
are preferred (Raftery, 1986, 1993, 1995).

°Without loss of generality, we have ignored the
structure of variable means. We have used the case
where sibship size is 4 to illustrate model specification.

hypotheses about the effects of family

In the baseline model, the goodness
of fit test yields L? = 51.09 with 20 df

4, and L? = 183.93 with 86 df. Each of
these test statistics is nominally statis
That is, with the exception of the additional
restrictions in Models B and C, we are reporting a
forward process of model selection. However, we
have also selected backward from a completely unrestricted one-factor model, and this process yields
the same preferred model, namely, the baseline
model of Table 3.

tically significant. However, in each
case, the corresponding bic statistic
is negative, bic = —98.71, bic=
—236.22 and bic = —389.82 for sizes 3,
4, and 5 respectively. That is, the baseline model can nominally be rejected
for each size of sibship, but the fit is not
bad enough to justify the loss of parsimony that rejection would entail.

Because it incorporates several restrictions, the fit of the baseline model
does not provide a global test of the
hypothesis that there is only one family
factor. For this reason, we also estimated a completely unrestricted onefactor model in sibships of sizes 4 and
5; in sibships of size 3, the completely
unrestricted model is just-identified, so
there is no test of its goodness-of-fit. In
sibships of size 4, the completely unrestricted model yields L? = 12.75 with
10 df, and in sibships of size 5,
L? = 65.92 with 31 df. The first of these
statistics does not approach statistical
significance, and the second is nominally significant, but bic is large and
negative for both models. Although
there is room for a 2-factor model to
improve fit, at least in sibships of size 5,
there does not appear to be strong
evidence that a second family factor is
needed to fit the data.

Model B and model C are more restrictive than model A. Although the
constraints in model A are analogous
to the findings from most studies of sibling resemblance, there are two more
hypotheses worth considering before
we test models with fewer constraints.
First, we specify that gender does not
alter the effect of family background
on educational attainment. Second, we
specify that gender does not affect the
within-family variance of schooling.
We test the first hypothesis in Model B;

Educational Attainment

 

that is, we specify A*,;; = 1 for all i, j,
and k. The contrasts of fit statistics
between model A and model B are
L* = 5.79 for size 3, L? = 24.12 for
size 4, and L* = 9.81 for size 5 with 1 df
for each. They are all nominally significant at the 0.02 level or beyond. We
have chosen to reject this hypothesis, —
partly because of the consistency of the
finding in each size of sibship.!! We
find Ax = 0.883, 0.762, and 0.829 in sibships of size 3, 4, and 5, respectively.
This implies that the effect of the common family factor on educational attainment among brothers, arbitrarily
normed at \* = 1.0, is larger than that
among sisters, regardless of sibship size
or gender composition.

The second restrictive hypothesis is
that the within-family variances in
schooling are equal between brothers
and sisters. We test this hypothesis by
imposing the constraint that all elements in ©® are equal and contrasting
the fit of model C with that of model A.
This hypothesis is easily rejected: for
size 3, the contrast between models C
and A yields L? = 157.87; for size 4,
the contrast yields L* = 99.57; and for
size 5, the contrast yields L? = 101.71,
each with 1 df. Also, there are corresponding increases in bic. These contrasts confirm the well-established
finding that, in the cohorts of the
1950’s, educational attainment is far
more variable among men than among
women (Hauser and Wong, 1989, p.
158-159; Sewell et al., 1980, p. 557).

Except in sibships of size 3, a positive bic statistic for the contrast also suggests rejection of the
alternative hypothesis. Raftery (1993) suggests that
changes in bic of less than 10 should not be taken
very seriously. Thus, the fit of this particular contrast remains ambiguous. We have in this case chosen to take the gender difference seriously, despite
the weak evidence for it.

For example, under model A, in sibships of size 3, the estimated withinfamily standard deviation of schooling
is 2.204 among brothers and 1.505
among sisters; in sibships of size 4, the
estimated within-family standard deviation of schooling is 2.098 among
brothers and 1.593 among sisters; in
sibships of size 5, the estimated withinfamily standard deviation of schooling
is 2.018 among brothers and 1.491
among sisters.

. Having rejected two more restrictive hypotheses, we selectively release
constraints in model A in order to test
less restrictive hypotheses about the effect of family background on educational attainment that are still consistent with the one-factor specification.
In model D, we release the cross-group
constraints on within-family variance
of schooling for brothers and for sisters. The hypothesis suggests that
gender composition affects the withinfamily variance of schooling of brothers and of sisters. The contrasts between model D and model A are
L? = 4.45 with 4 df for size 3, L? =
9.91 with 6 df for size 4, and L* = 21.87
with 8 df for size 5. The fit of size 5 is
on the borderline, but the bic statistic
increases by 31.96. Thus, model D is
rejected for sibships of all sizes. All the
same, in model E we use model D asa
point of comparison in order to test the
hypothesis that within-family variances
differ by birth order within gender.
That is, we release all of the remaining
equality constraints on ©®. The contrasts of fit statistics are L* = 19.61
with 6 df for size 3, L? = 35.26 with 12
df for size 4, and L? = 40.67 with 20 df
for size 5; they are each significant at
the 0.003 level. However, the bic statistics increase by 25.33 for size 3, by

Kuo and Hauser

 

Social Biology

49.60 for size 4, and by 92.64 for size 5.
Since we already rejected model D, we
also reject model E.

_ The hypothesis in model F tests
cross-group equality in the loadings of
the common family factor on educational attainment for brothers and for
sisters. That is, we release the crossgroup constraints on Ax. The change of
fit is negligible for sibships of all three
sizes: L? = 1.48 with 1 df for size 3;
L? = 1.26 with 2 df for size 4; and
L? = 3.58 with 3 df for size 5. We reject
this hypothesis. Analogous to the comparison between model D and model
E, in model G we use model F as a
point of comparison in order to test the
hypothesis that within-family loadings
differ by birth order within gender.
That is, we release all of the remaining
equality constraints on A*. The contrasts of fit statistics are L* = 13.76
with 5 df for size 3; L? = 34.19 with 11
df for size 4; and L* = 30.66 with 19 df
for size 5; they are significant at the
0.044 level. Although the contrasts between models G and F are stronger
than the contrasts between model D
and E, the bic statistics increase substantially, as in the comparison between models D and E; we reject
model G as well.

In model H, we release the crossgroup constraints on ®. The model
suggests that the variance of the common family factor varies by gender
composition of sibship, even though
gender composition does not affect the
within-family variance of schooling or
the effect of family background on siblings’ schooling. The contrasts between
model H and model A yield L? = 0.26
with 3 df for size 3; L? = 6.74 with 4 df
for size 4; and L? = 0.70 with 5 df for
size 5. The less constrained hypothesis,
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

Vol. 43, No. 1-2

model H, is obviously rejected. The estimated variances of the common family factor are 2.554, 2.490, and. 2.030
for size 3, 4, and 5 respectively, which
suggests that smaller families are more
heterogeneous than larger families. 12

Model A is our preferred model.
The preceding findings and fit statistics
indirectly support the conclusion that,
among sibships of 3, 4, and 5, a constrained one-factor model satisfactorily
explains the covariation of sisters’ and
brothers’ educational attainments. We
also find that gender composition has
essentially no effects on the factorial
structure of siblings’ educational attainments. It does not affect the loadings of educational attainments on
the common family factors, the withinfamily variances in education, or the
variance in the common family factor.
At the same time, we do find substantial effects of gender: Within-family
variances in schooling are much larger
among brothers than among sisters,
and the effects of the common family
factor are larger on brothers than on
sisters.

In the next section, we analyze differences in the effects of family background, gender, family configuration,
and relative birth order on educational
attainment. Then, we use our preferred model of effects of background
and gender to test the hypothesis that
there are distinct family background
factors for brothers and for sisters. Finally, we incorporate means into the

12We had thought, from other analyses of family
effects, that larger families were more heterogeneous than smaller families. Our finding raises the
possibility that this heterogeneity may be an artifact
of composition, e.g., of the greater hkelihood of
heterogeneity in gender in larger sibships, rather
than of an intrinsic increase in heterogeneity within
larger families.

Educational Attainment 115

structural model in order to examine to
what extent the common family factor,
educational attainment of siblings, and
social origins are different between
brothers and sisters, and across groups
defined by gender composition.

EFFECTS OF FAMILY BACKGROUND

We apply a modified MIMIC model
to test whether the family configurations moderate the effect of family
background characteristics. Figure 3
displays the path diagrams of a
multiple-group model of sibling resemblance. It modifies slightly the conventional multiple-group MIMIC model,
which has been used in previous analyses of birth order effects on sibling
resemblance, e.g., Hauser and Wong
(1989, p. 156).?3 In the conventional
MIMIC model, the structure is

M=TEt+e (9)

where 7 is the endogenous latent variable, &€ is a vector of exogenous latent
variables, € is a vector of disturbances
(with variance-covariance matrix W)
that are independent of n and &, and T
is a parameter matrix. In each group,
there is only one 4, a latent factor
which carries the effect of social origins

13The dashed, curved paths among the error
terms (¢) in Figure 3 show an alternative MIMIC
model, which is not preferred, but which we use to
distinguish between the fit of the factor model per se
and the constraints on loadings imposed by effects
of the exogenous variables (Hauser and Goldberger, 1971). If we eliminate the disturbance in the
common family factor, we can free all of the withinfamily error covariances, and the contrast between
the fit of this model and the MIMIC model without
error covariances provides a test of the consistency
between the loadings implied by social background
effects and those implied by a single factor model of
siblings’ educational attainments, as well as a test of
the overidentifying restrictions implied by the
single-factor model of educational attainment.

this model is formally equivalent to the
conventional MIMIC model. However, in the modified model, the effect
of family background on siblings’ educational attainments can be partitioned
into two different elements by specifying B’s and )»’s separately (S6rbom and
Jéreskog, 1981); later, we use this feature of the modified model to specify
effects of relative birth order and of

the extra latent variables (ns) permit us to introduce
direct effects of the exogenous variables on the
endogenous variables (Kuo and Hauser, 1990).
Only the first advantage is important for the purposes of this paper.

each highly significant statistically, but the bic statistics are satisfactory. While the contrasts between
these models and the’corresponding baseline models are each statistically significant, the bic statistics
are much smaller in the more constrained baseline
model. Further, when we eliminate the disturbance
in the common family factor and free the covariances among within-family errors, the test statistics
for the contrasts between these models and the unconstrained MIMIC model are L? = 17.17 with 8 df
for size 3, bic = —60.33; L? = 49.11 with 25 df for
size 4, bic = ~185.24; and L? = 126.48 with 54 df

without error covariances is preferable to the model
with covariances, and the (more constrained) baseline model is yet more preferable.

educational attainments of sisters and
brothers, the within-family variances
of schooling for sisters and brothers,
the effect of social origins on the common family factor, or the variance of
the common family factor. Second,
gender may affect the influence of the
common family factor on educational
attainment and the within-family variances of schooling among sisters and
brothers. From the findings of the
previous section, we consider these
constraints appropriate in our baseline
model. Third, we equate the effect of
father’s educational level on the common factor with that of mother’s educational level; that is, the effect of
father’s education on the educational
attainment of offspring is equal to that
of mothers (Hauser and Wong, 1989,
pp. 159, 167). Sewell et al. (1980)
found that effects of father’s education
and mother’s education were very
close in the process of educational attainment for Wisconsin women, but
only father’s education affected the
educational attainment for Wisconsin
men. Tsai (1983) found that, controlling for measurement errors, effects of
father’s education and mother’s education on educational attainment were
the same for Wisconsin women and
men. Lee (1989) used sibling pair data
and also found that the effects on a
common family education factor were

equal.
In the baseline model, the
goodness-of-fit statistics are L* =

153.48 with 87 df for size 3, L? =
248.04 with 161 df for size 4, and
L? = 392.72 with 261 df for size S.
They are highly significant statistically,
but the bic statistics are quite satisfactory: bic = —498.15, bic = —890.48
and bic = —1347.02 for sizes 3, 4, and

we selectively release constraints in
model A in order to test less restrictive
hypotheses about the effect of family
background on educational attainment
that are still consistent with the specification of a single family factor.!8 In
model B, we test the hypothesis that
the within-family variances of schooling for brothers and sisters vary with
gender composition; that is, we release
across-group constraints on A” for
brothers and for sisters. The contrasts
of fit statistics are L? = 2.80 with 4 df
for size 3, L? = 10.71 with 6 df for size
4, and L? = 19.98 with 8 df for size 5.
This is nominally significant only in sibships of size 5, and bic increases in each
test. Thus, we reject this hypothesis.
We find that gender composition does
not affect the within-family variance of
schooling of brothers and sisters. In
model C, we use model B as a point of
comparison in order to test the hypothesis that within-family variances differ
by birth order within gender. That is,
we release all of the remaining equality
constraints on ©*. The contrasts of fit
Statistics yield L? = 21.99 with 6 df for
size 3, L? = 29.87 with 12 df for size 4,

17Note that, when we use bic as a criterion, these
highly restricted models each fit better than the corresponding unrestricted models.

18As in our analysis of the one-factor model, we
have tried both forward and backward selection,
and each procedure led to the same preferred models, namely, Model A in Tables 4, 5, and 6. We have
also tested models, within each size of sibship,
which constrain the variance-covariance matrices of
the exogenous (social background) variables to be
invariant with respect to gender composition. In
sibships of sizes 3 and 4, the fit of this highly constrained model is not significantly different from
that of the baseline model. While the nominal improvement in fit is significant in sibships of size 5,
bic is smaller under this constrained model than
in our baseline model. Thus, we think that gender
composition is not selective with respect to the joint
distributions of social background variables.

and L? = 39.77 with 20 df for size 5.
They are significant at 0.006 level and
beyond. However, the bic statistics increase by 22.95 for size 3, 54.99 for size
4, and 93.66 for size 5. We have already
rejected model B, and thus we reject
model C as well.

The hypothesis in model D tests
whether gender composition of the sibship affects the influence of the common family factors on the educational
attainments of siblings. We release the
cross-group constraints on A’’s. The
contrasts between model D and model
A yield L? = 2.34 with 2 df for size 3,
L? = 0.92 with 3 df for size 4, and L? =
2.92 with 4 df for size 5. None of these
contrasts approaches statistical significance. The hypothesis is rejected; that
is, gender composition of the sibship
does not alter the effect of the common
family factor on the educational attainment of offspring. Analogous to the
comparison between models B and C,
we use the specification in model D as
a point of comparison in order to test
the hypothesis that the effects of the
common family factor on the educational attainments of siblings differ
by birth order within gender. When we
release all of the remaining equality
constraints on A’, the contrasts of fit
between model D and model E are
L? = 10.27 with 5 df for size 3, L? =
30.83 with 11 df for size 4, and
L? = 27.66 with 19 df for size 5. However, the bic statistics increase by
44.67, 54.03, and 105.66 for size 3, 4,
and 5 respectively. We also reject
model E.

In model F and model G, we test hypotheses relevant to specific family
background variables. First, model F
tests that the effects of father’s education and of mother’s education on ed
 

 

Educational Attainment 121

ucational attainments of offspring differ. We reject this hypothesis because
the contrasts of fit between model A
and model F are negligible: L* = 0.25,
L? = 0.45, and L? = 0.42 with 1 df for
sibships of sizes 3, 4, and 5. The failure
of this hypothesis supports findings
from previous studies: The effect of father’s education on educational attainments of offspring is as important as
that of mother’s education (Hauser
and Wong, 1989; Lee, 1990). By releasing the other constraints on coefficients of family background variables,
with model F as the point of comparison, we test the hypothesis that effects
of measured family variables on educational attainments of offspring vary
across groups. The contrasts of fit statistics yield L* = 15.43 with 18 df for
size 3, L? = 25.16 with 24 df for size 4,
and L? = 32.13 with 30 df for size S.
None of these contrasts approaches
statistical significance, and we reject
this hypothesis.

In model H, we release the final
constraint on model A, cross-group
equality in Y. Model H suggests that
the variances of the unmeasured family
factor differ by gender composition.
The change of fit is insignificant for sibship of all three sizes: L? = 2.83 with 3
df for size 3, L? = 7.16 with 4 df for size
4, and L? = 5.34 with 5 df for size S.
We fail to accept model H.

In a final model, we partition the effect of family background into effects
of gender (AY) and ordinal position
within gender (B); then both matrices
are estimated with the slopes for brothers and oldest siblings normalized as
one. That 1s, we distinguish the first
sibling from others in matrix B: B,5, =
Boor = Basi = Bao = Bsar = Baar =
Bast = Bsar = 1.0 and By3, = Bia: =

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

122

Bis: = Boar = Bos: = Basar = Basi =

Basi = Bast = Bsai = Bsai = Bss1 for
sibships of size 4. That is, the effect of

the family factor on educational attainment is equal to one for eldest brothers, 8,3, for other brothers, ),,, for eldest sisters and (Aj; X B,3,) for other
sisters. Compared to model A, the current model has one df less but L? does
not decrease significantly in sizes 3 and
5 (1.64 and 3.00); in size 4, the contrast
of L? is 5.96, yet the bic statistic increases only by 1.11. Thus, we reject
the hypothesis that the oldest brother
differs from other brothers and the
oldest sister differs from other sisters
in the effect of family background.
Again, this finding should be read as
pertaining only to our definition of relative birth order within gender.

PARAMETERS OF THE MIMIC MopDEL

Table 7 gives parameter estimates of
our preferred models of sibling resemblance in educational attainment. The
within-family variances of brothers’
schooling (4.71, 4.39, and 4.05) vary
inversely with size of sibship while the
variances of sisters’ attainments (2.35,
2.54, and 2.24) barely differ. Thus,
the differences of within-family or nonshared variances (8°) of schooling between brothers and sisters decline
along with increases in size of sibship.
The variances (W) of the unmeasured,
shared family factor decrease with
increases in size of sibship. They are
1.57, 1.42, and 1.26 for sizes 3, 4, and
5, respectively.19 The effects of the

'9These variances are, of course, smaller than
those in the single factor model with no exogenous
variables because they do not include the variance
associated with measured background variables. All
the same, we find the same pattern of declining heterogeneity with increased family size.

Kuo and Hauser

 

Social Biology

family factors on sisters, 0.84, 0.76,
and 0.81, are smaller than on brothers
(for whom the effects are normalized
as one); that is, the common family
factor—including both measured and
unmeasured family characteristics—
influences sisters one-fifth to onequarter less than brothers. Possibly excepting Catholic upbringing, which
lowers schooling in sibships of size 3
and has insignificant positive coefficients in sibships of size 4 or 5, there do
not appear to be any substantial variations in the effect of measured social
background by size of sibship.

strictions on I and W, we can test alternatives to the one-factor MIMIC

sisters and with one or fewer brothers.
For example, in sibship size 4, both
factors are identified only in the third
group, which contains two brothers
and two sisters. We use cross-group
constraints to identify properties of the
latent factor indicated by only one sibling. That is, we use information from
the groups with more than two siblings
of each gender to identify the parameters of the factor model for groups in

which there is only one brother or only
one sister. We also equate the parameters for men and women in the three
gender configurations for each sex in
which the gender-specific factor model
is identified. That is, the single factor
model for men is identified in the first
three groups, while the single factor
model for women is identified in the
last three groups.

Model J, a nominal two-factor
model, is equivalent to model A of Tables 4, 5, and 6. Thus, the fit statistics
are identical: L* = 153.48 with 87 df
for size 3, L? = 248.04 with 161 df for
size 4, and L? = 392.72 with 261 df for
size 5. In model K, we release the
within-group constraints on I and, in
model L, we release the within-group
constraints on W. The contrasts between model K and model J are L* =
18.97 with 5 df for size 3, L? = 19.24
with 5 df for size 4, and L? = 7.46 with
5 df for size 5. Although the contrast
for sizes 3 and 4 are significant at the
0.002 level, the bic statistic increases
by 18.48 and 16.11. Thus, we reject the
hypothesis that there are distinctive effects of the measured background variables on brothers and sisters; that is,
there are no gender differences in the
relative effects of family income, mother’s and father’s education, father’s
occupational status, farm origin, and
Catholic religious origin. The only
significant differences in these effects
between brothers and sisters are their
systematically lower values among
women than among men.

In model L, we release the constraints on to test the hypothesis that
there are two distinct unmeasured factors, one for brothers and the other
for sisters. That is, we release the constraints of equality among ,5,, Wxi1>

Educational Attainment 125

and W,.> for each gender composition
group, while retaining the constraints
of equality in corresponding parameters across groups. The contrasts between this model and model J are
L? = 12.68, L? = 0.57, and L? = 11.12
with 2 df for sizes 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The largest contrast, that for
size 3, is significant at 0.002 level, but
the bic statistics only decrease by 2.30.
Thus, we reject this hypothesis as well.
Our failure to accept model K and
model L support the assumption of the
one-factor model in previous sibling
resemblance studies, e.g., Hauser and
Wong (1989).

STRUCTURAL MODEL WITH MEANS

The preceding structural models all
ignore the means of the variables; that
is, we have ignored differences among
groups in mean levels of social background and in mean levels of attainment. We have also ignored differences in mean levels of attainment
between men and women, as well as
other possible differences, e.g., by relative birth order. We now drop this
simplification and estimate means of
educational attainments of siblings,
family background variables, and latent common family factors. We are interested not only in estimating the
means, but also in testing cross- and
within-group constraints on the means
of measured and latent variables, that
is, testing hypotheses that parallel our
previous tests of differences in slopes
and variance components.

The mean of a latent variable is
under-identified. To estimate the effects of latent variables on observable
variables, we have to normalize one of
the effects and estimate other effects in
proportion to the normalized effect;

 

 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

126

likewise, to estimate the means of latent variables, we have to normalize
one of the means as zero and estimate
its difference from others.2!_ The
MIMIC model is now defined by the
following equations:

n=at+TPE+C (18)
x=T+A°E+8 (19)
y=vV+A ynt+e (20)

where a, t*, t” are vectors of constant
intercept terms. Owing to the specification of structure of endogenous variables, Equations 13 and 14 can be'rewritten in matrix form as follows:

[ni |= [a] +f Yi2 Y13 Yia Yis Vie Yr V4}+ [=(21)

n2 A> Boy
Na] = |o3] + [Bsr
N4 Oy Bay
Ns Os B51

where $21 = B31 = By = Bs. = 1.0.

The factorial structure of this mode]
is identical to model A, except that
constraints of t” = 0 and t* = O are removed. In model M, we test the hypothesis that the educational attainments of sisters are equal to each other
and that those of brothers are equal to
each other within each group defined
by gender composition. That is, we
equate the mean of schooling (t”) for

brothers and for sisters within each
group, for example, in sibships of size
4,0 in = Vio = P33 = Wy4q, P222 =
W733 = Vo4q4, P31 = W322, V333 =
T3445 P4ry = W4o2 = W433, and 1511 =
W559 = 533 = W544. The contrasts of
L? between model M and model A are
3.92 with 6 df for size 3, 10.20 with 12
df for size 4, and 31.06 with 20 df for
size 5. We fail to reject this hypothesis;
the differences of years of schooling
among sisters and those among brothers in a family are not statistically significant at even the 0.05 level. Next,
we impose constraints of cross-group
equality (within each gender) in model
N, for example, in size 4, 141; = Wp
= W133 = W144 = Va22 = W233 = Wray
= 0333 = V34a = Wagg and Vay =
Vai = V322 = Marr = Va = W433 =
M511 = W522 = W533 = W544. This constraint says that gender composition
does not affect mean educational attainments of sisters and of brothers.
The contrasts of fit between model M
and this model are L? = 7.56 with 4 df
for size 3, L? = 4.75 with 6 df for size
4, and L* = 10.09 with 8 df for size 5;
these are all insignificant. We fail to reject this hypothesis as well. In model
O, all means of years of schooling are
specified to be equal, regardless of
gender and gender composition. This
model is rejected. With an increase of
one df, the contrasts of L? between
model O and model N are 101.00,
55.69, and 27.84 for sizes 3, 4, and 5
respectively. In sum, differences of educational attainment between sisters
and brothers persist, but there are no
effects of family configuration or of relative birth order.

We equate the means of each family
background variable across gender
composition in model P; that is, t* (the

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

Vol. 43, No. 1-2

matrix of means of family background
variables) is invariant across groups.
The contrasts of L* (with model N) are
insignificant: 16.83 with 18 df, 19.29
with 24 df, and 50.56 with 30 df. In
model Q, we test the hypothesis that
the mean of father’s education is equal
to that of mothers. The contrasts of
fit yield L* = 57.12, L* = 82.44, and
L? = 79.75 with one df for each size;
the model is rejected.

In model R, we condition on model
P to test hypotheses about means of the
latent factors. The constraints on a’s
are lifted to estimate the difference in
means of the family factor across gender composition. In model R, we specify that the first a in the first group is
zero and estimate the first a’s in the
other groups. This hypothesis tests
whether the means of the common
family factors differ from each other.
The contrasts of fit between model R
and model P yield L? = 1.71 with 3 df
for size 3, L? = 2.82 with 4 df for size
4, and L? = 5.21 with 5 df for size 5.
The nonsignificance of these test statistics implies that the means of the
common family factors do not vary
with gender composition. In sum, in
our preferred model (P), within each
size of sibship, there are no differences
in mean levels of family background
or educational attainment by gender
composition, nor are there differences
in educational attainment by relative
birth order within gender; the only significant differences in means are those
between brothers’ and sisters’ educational attainments.

The more substantial differences in
means occur across sibship sizes. The
mean of years of schooling for both
sisters and brothers consistently decreases with increasing sibship size,

Educational Attainment

 

127

that is, 13.20 in size 3, 12.93 in size 4,
and 12.73 in size 5 for sisters, and 13.77
in size 3, 13.39 in size 4, and 13.06 in
size 5 for brothers. Within each size of
sibship, brothers obtain more schooling than their sisters. It also appears
that the gaps of educational attainment
among different sibship sizes are larger
for brothers than for sisters, that is,
brothers benefit more from small sibship size than sisters do, and mean educational differences between brothers
and sisters decrease with increasing
sibship sizes.

DISCUSSION

As the study shows, sisters’ educational attainments differ from those of
their brothers, with respect to the level
of schooling completed, the dependence of schooling on social background, and the variability in school
completion. However, these differences follow a relatively simple pattern. First, sisters have less education
than their brothers. Second, the absence of competition for resources with
brothers, that is, the all-sister family,
does not improve educational attainments of girls. Third, the negative effect of sibship size on education may be
moderated by gender; size matters less
for girls. Fourth, gender composition
does not affect inequality of education;
that is, the variance in the common
family effect on schooling does not
vary by gender composition. Fifth,
there is less inequality in educational
attainment among women than among
their brothers. This result has two
sources: Family background has less
influence on the educational attainments of sisters than on brothers. Also,
there is less variation in education

128

within families among women than
among their brothers.

How can we interpret persistent
inequality between women and their
brothers, along with substantial equality within gender? According to the
maximization assumption (Becker,
1980), along with the increase of family
size, parents are more likely to invest
in a certain child, the most gifted, a
boy, or the oldest, to maximize their
return. On the other hand, the compensation hypothesis says that parents
try to equalize outcomes, so they tend
to ‘‘allocate resources equally between
their children and to compensate, to
some extent, for the handicaps of the
children with lower natural endowments” (Griliches, 1979). Both arguments are partially supported. Parents
might invest more in boys than in girls,
but within gender, parents invest
equally, at least with respect to the
characteristic measured here, relative
birth order. There may be other characteristics of siblings, not included in
our models, such as differences among
children in health, ability, and motivation, that may tend to attract or discourage parental investment. However, our negative findings with respect
to relative birth order and gender composition tend to rule out the influence
of factors that might be highly correlated with them.

We also reject the hypothesis that
mother’s education has a larger effect
than father’s education on sons or on
daughters. That is, in none of our
one-factor models do we reject the hypothesis that the effect of maternal
schooling is equal to that of paternal
schooling, nor do we find that the relative effects of social background vari
Kuo and Hauser

 

Social Biology

ables differ between brothers and sisters.22 Thus, our findings agree with
those of Tsai (1983) and Lee (1989) but
slightly differ from those of Sewell et
al. (1980).

We do not find that birth order affects educational attainment, nor does
it change the effect of family background on educational attainment. In
the full Wisconsin sample, Sewell and
Hauser (1986; Retherford and Sewell,
1993) also did not find any birth order
effects on educational attainment, but
in the 1962 Occupational Changes in a
Generation survey (OCG), Blau and
Duncan (1967) found an advantage for
the eldest and youngest in a large family. This discrepancy may be due to differences in population definition. The
OCG is sampled from a number of cohorts in the general population, but the
WLS always has at least one sibling
graduating from high school. Second,
Sewell and Hauser studied both brothers and sisters, while Blau and Duncan
only investigated brothers. Lee (1989)
found that birth order affects the influence of family background only in sister pairs, while we find birth order has
no influence at all.25

From the findings of our study, we
think that it may be useful to develop
new analyses of the influence of size of
sibship on educational and other socioeconomic outcomes. We believe that
the full sibship model is an appropriate

22Recall that the latter hypothesis is tested by
the constraints on I in the two-factor model.

Again, differences in population definition
may explain this discrepancy. From Table 1, we calculate that more than three-quarters of potential sister pairs occur in families of six or more siblings,
which are not included in our analyses.

and powerful way to study the effect of
family configuration on the resemblance and variation among siblings.
At the same time, our findings are essentially negative with respect to hypotheses that depend on our use of
data from full sibships. Thus, we do not
think that there is a great deal to be lost
in future research that may be limited

to hypotheses that can only be conve
niently tested using data for sibling
pairs. Moreover, in using data for full
sibships, we have had to limit our analyses to those data for individual members of sibships that were available for
every member, in this case, only gender, educational attainment, and the
position of the sibling in his or her own
family structure.

Since the 1960’s, American family
structure has changed dramatically. In
the Wisconsin sample, less than 10 per
cent of our primary respondents reported having grown up in a nonintact
family, and widows were as common
as other female heads. In the 1980’s, at
least, the educational achievement of
children from families of widowed parents did not differ from that in intact
families (McLanahan and Sandefur,
1994). Thus, the increasing share of
divorced or never-married heads of
one-parent families has altered family
structure in ways that might affect educational outcomes. Also, declining
fertility after the 1960’s may have
changed the effects of gender composition. Here, we only study sibship
sizes three to five, which are now unusually large.

We believe that a great deal more
can be learned about family resemblance by bringing in more individual
and family variables, which is not fea
Educational Attainment 129

sible in most studies, including the
Wisconsin study, for more than two
siblings in each family. For example,
following Olneck (1977, 1979), Sewell
and Hauser (1986) have brought individual measures of academic ability
into models of education, occupational
status, and income among brothers in
the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, and
the 1992-93 round of the WLS will
provide new individual data for a much
larger sample of brother and sister
pairs (Hauser et al., 1994).
