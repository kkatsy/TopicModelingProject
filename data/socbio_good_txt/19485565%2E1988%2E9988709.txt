ABSTRACT: This paper examines the effects of nursing behavior on the duration of lactation
enorrhea in 382 rural Indonesian women who experienced resumption of menses while
reastfeeding or were breastfeeding and amenorrheic at the end of a two-year prospective
Gstudy. Three primary breastfeeding variables (number of night-time nursing bouts, number of
crday-time nursing bouts, and minutes per bout) were used to develop a behavioral model for
‘breastfeeding. Four breastfeeding patterns were identified for these women. These were
“designated as: (1) low intensity, (2) medium-low intensity, (3) medium-high intensity, and (4)
Shigh intensity breastfeeding behavior. Menses resumed at medians of 11.2, 16.0, 17.6, and 20.8
-=inonths, respectively, for these groups. The relationships among the breastfeeding variables in
.2the behavioral model and return to menses were developed and tested by life table and
roportional hazards models. Ten per cent of the high intensity breastfeeding group (6 women)
‘Gdelayed menses between 33 and 52 weeks, while 90 per cent (56 women) postponed return of

Zmenses for over one year.

Huffman and coworkers (1987) have
Frecently reviewed studies from both the
—developed and developing world which
Shave investigated how varying patterns
Lof breastfeeding affect the onset of postpartum fecundity. The consensus which
Sderives from these studies is that the
Aperiod of lactational amenorrhea and
anovulation are dependent, either directly or indirectly, on the type of nursing practiced by the mothers. These conclusions are, however, based on only a
very limited number of investigations,
and the associations among breastfeeding patterns, practices, and resumption
of fecundity postpartum have not been
thoroughly investigated much beyond
the clinical setting. This paper is designed to contribute to this growing and

important area of research in human
population biology.

The present study is based on longitudinal data gathered in central Java and
explores the association of postpartum
suckling patterns and duration of amenorrhea in Indonesian women. From
these data, a behavioral model for
breastfeeding effects on fecundity
(defined here as resumption of menses
postpartum) is developed. The model
that is presented is an extension of earlier research on this population, but
here serves to clarify the relationships
among the primary breastfeeding variables measured in the study, the actual
nursing behavior practiced by each
woman, and resumption of menses postpartum.

The importance of quantifying nursing behavior directly in these types of
studies, as opposed to the use of duration of breastfeeding as a proxy variable
for nursing behavior, has been demonstrated by the recent advances in the endocrinology of lactational and other
types of amenorrhea. Current research
suggests that alterations in luteinizing
hormone (LH) secretion play a significant role in both clinical and postpartum amenorrhea. During the normal
menstrual cycle, LH is released from the
anterior pituitary in an episodic (or
pulsatile) mode. The pulsatile secretion
of LH occurs as a direct result of the
pulsatile release of gonadotropinreleasing hormone (GnRH), a decapeptide secreted from neuroendocrine cells
in the hypothalamus and reaching the
anterior pituitary via the hypophysial
portal blood system. The organization
of GnRH neurons for the synchronous
release of this decapeptide is generally
referred to as a hypothalamic pulse generator (Knobil, 1980; Ferin et al., 1984).
The integrity of the hypothalamic pulse
generator is essential for normal menstrual/ovulatory cycles. In many clinical
amenorrheic states the pulsatile secretion of LH is either altered or absent;
and many of these conditions have been
corrected by the exogenous, intermittent infusion of GnRH subcutaneously
(Leyendecker et al., 1980; Crowley and
McArthur, 1980; Glasier et al., 1986).

Alteration in the pulsatile secretion
of LH appears to be responsible for
postpartum amenorrhea and anovulation associated with breastfeeding as
well. Stimulation of the nipple by nurs
‘ing sets up a neuroendocrine reflex that

reduces the ability of the hypothalamus
to maintain pulsatile GnRH secretion
and hence LH secretion, reduces the
normal FSH:LH ratio, and retards fol

licular development (Glasier et al.,
1984; Glasier et al., 1986). The exact
mechanism by which the suckling stimulus decreases GnRH output remains to
be elucidated. It appears that the suckling stimulus itself acting either to inhibit
the hypothalamic pulse generator neurons directly, or acting to induce betaendorphin inhibition of the hypothalamic pulse generator neurons, or
possibly both, is largely responsible for
postpartum lactational infertility (Ferin
et al., 1984) Though highly correlated
with suckling parameters, raised levels
of prolactin, which have in the past been
thought to cause postpartum amenorrhea and anovulation, apparently reflect
the strength of the suckling stimulus
rather than a direct causal mechanism in
postpartum infertility (Ferin et al.,
1984; McNeilly et al., 1985).

While the suckling stimulus can be
seen as a direct link in a chain of events
leading to postpartum lactational amenorrhea and anovulation, nursing is more
than just a physiological phenomenon.
Breastfeeding behavior embodies
strong social and cultural norms which
relate to the health and well-being of the
mother/child dyad, nutriment of child,
proscribed sexual activity postpartum,
as well as to other aspects of social behavior (Neville and Neifert, 1983).
Thus, while the contraceptive effect of
breastfeeding is a complex mechanism
at the physiological level, involving sequential phases of lactational amenorrhea, anovulatory cycles, ovulatory cycles with deficient luteal phase, and
finally normal ovulatory cycles leading
to conception (Howie and McNeilly,
1982), it is also a complex mechanism at
the behavioral level. Not all women pass
through all these phases, and ovulation
and conception can precede first menstruation (Badraoui and Hefnawi,
 

Vol. 35, No. 3-4

1979), apparently due to the wide range
in variability in breastfeeding behavior
which is practiced in different societies.
Variation in duration of anovulation
or amenorrhea postpartum should be
seen, therefore, as a dose-dependent
phenomenon, that is, one which is heavily dependent upon the frequency and
intensity of the suckling stimulus. High
frequencies of suckling have been found
into be associated with extended periods
Sof amenorrhea in studies in Bangladesh,
Zaire, The Gambia, and among the
€ !Kung Bushmen of Botswana (Huffman
set al., 1980; Hennart and Vis, 1980;
Akonner and Worthman, 1980; Lunn et
Sal., 1980). These types of doseS'dependent relationships are explored
“for Indonesian women in the present
wstudy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data for the research presented
in this paper derives from the Ngaglik
“‘Zproject, a prospective study undertaken
© between 1976 and 1978 in a rural agriculStural village, located 15 kilometers
[north of the city of Yogyakarta in cenEtral Java, Indonesia. Details of the design and aims of the study have been
published elsewhere (The Ngaglik
sStudy Team, 1976; Hull, 1984), as well
Aas earlier findings (Bracher and Santow,
1982; Hull, 1984; Santow and Bracher,
1984; Santow, 1987). Briefly, the sampling frame for the Ngaglik project was
established from a household census
and economic survey of two rural villages which identified 2,503 evermarried women in the age group 15-49.
From this population, a group of 510
women was followed prospectively by
monthly visits for two years until July
1978 when the field portion of the study
ended. This group included those

women who had either reported they
were pregnant or had a livebirth, stillbirth, or abortion between January 1,
1976 and the start of the study in May
1976. Besides data on the pregnancies
and births, infant and child mortality,
postpartum amenorrhea, abstinence
and sexual relations, contraceptive use,
and maternal and child health and nutrition, data on breastfeeding behavior
and weaning were also collected.

The type of nursing behavior was
elicited through recall at each monthly
interview as the average number of
suckling bouts which occurred during
the day-time and night-time hours and
the average minutes per nursing bout for
the preceding month. Three primary
breastfeeding variables, (1) average
number of nursing bouts during the day,
(2) average number of nursing bouts
during the night, and (3) average minutes per nursing bout, were derived
from these data for each woman. These
variables were calculated as unweighted
means over all the monthly visits up to
the return of menses, censoring at the
end of the study, or loss to follow-up,
whichever occurred earliest. As a consequence, only breastfeeding data relevant to return of menses were used in
the analysis (Habicht et al., 1985). Secondary breastfeeding variables, including the total number of bouts per day,
total minutes of nursing during the daytime hours, total minutes of nursing during the night-time hours, and the total
minutes of nursing during the 24-hour
day were derived from the three primary variables for each woman.

The present analysis is concerned
with the behavioral mechanisms of nursing and lactational infertility, so only
those women who experienced return of
menses while breastfeeding or were
amenorrheic and breastfeeding at the

end of the study contributed information directly on nursing behavior and return to menses postpartum. Of the 390
women who met these criteria, 382 provided breastfeeding data and were included in the sample. The eight women
who were excluded had provided retrospective data on their birth event, but
had menstruated and weaned before
providing monthly data on the type of
breastfeeding behavior they had practiced.

The dependent variable in the study,
the duration of postpartum amenorrhea, is defined following Delgado and
coworkers (1982), as the interval (in
days) between parturition and the first
incidence of two menses occurring
within a 90-day period. This more strict
definition of return to menses tends to
eliminate those cases where medical
problems stemming from the pregnancy
and delivery are mistaken by women in
recall data as return of menses. These
problems generally arise in the first few
weeks following parturition, and if reported as menses, would tend to bias the
estimate of the duration of postpartum
amenorrhea downward. However,
since the procedure also leads to more
censoring than if single reportings are
accepted as return of menses, the overall effect is probably to lengthen,
slightly, the estimation of the average
duration of amenorrhea. This bias, however, is expected to be small and to have
no effect on the estimation of covariates
of return to menses.

In the present analysis no attempt is
made to distinguish between full and
partial breastfeeding. In Ngaglik over 90
per cent of the infants were receiving
supplementary food by the age of one
month (Hull, 1984). The introduction of
small amounts of food within the first

few days of the infant’s life is a common
practice among Javanese mothers and
does not generally constitute a significant portion of the child’s early diet
(Geertz, 1961).

Lire TABLES

Typically in prospective studies,
events such as weaning, infant mortality, and resumption of menses postpartum are recorded with considerable accuracy, and the heaping associated with
retrospective reporting of these events is
avoided. However, because prospective
studies tend to be of short duration—in
the present study, two years of data
gathering—censoring is unavoidable for
the events where individuals do not have
ending times, either because the study
was concluded before they experienced
the event or because they were unavailable for a follow-up visit at some time
during the study. This was the situation
in the present study where events were
reported to the exact day from the reference birth with a high degree of accuracy, but for resumption of menses, only
260 of the 382 women considered here
experienced a return of menses postpartum before the study ended. As a consequence, when life table analysis was applied to the data in the present study, the
product-limit life table method of Kaplan and Meier (1958) was used to take
into account the exact time during which
each woman was at risk of menstruating
regardless of whether menses had actually been observed. With the productlimit life table, failure probabilities are
estimated at each distinct duration, in
days, at which menses returned. These
probabilities are the ratio of the number
of women whose menses returned at
that duration to the number of women
still amenorrheic and at risk of resumpVol. 35, No. 3-4

tion of menses postpartum. The survival
function for all observations derived
from the failure probabilities is an estimate of the proportion of women who
have not yet menstruated postpartum.
A log-rank statistic (Generalized
Wilcoxon) is used to test for significant
differences between the survival functions for various groups. Life table analysis was used as a preliminary step in examining the effects of covariates on
sSresumption of menses in this study.

PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL

cember 2

The breastfeeding covariates of reAsumption of menses postpartum can be
examined in a multivariate mode
Gtthrough the use of the proportional hazcoards model (Cox, 1972; Kalbfleisch and
Prentice, 1980). This technique has
“sfound its most common application in
Selinical trials for the analysis of censored
‘Ssurvival data where mortality risk varies
among individuals. These data generally

-ssurvival of each subject, terminating ina
predefined end-point (such as death or
‘=relapse of an illness after treatment) or
censoring if the individual has been lost
>
Sto follow-up or the study terminated and
“Othe event of interest not observed. DeSmographers typically use a more general
form of the hazard model where the covAariates may take different values at different times between two successive
events (Trussell and Hammerslough,
1983). The more general form is used
because the problems frequently considered in demographic studies, such as
marriage dissolution (Menken et al.,
1981) or infant mortality (Martin et al.,
1983), have both time-varying covariates and censored survival data.
In this paper, the proportional hazards model is used in its original formu

lation because the time interval under
consideration (two years following a reference birth) is relatively short, and for
the event considered (resumption of
postpartum menstruation), the survival
function gradually decreases in a monotonic fashion over the postpartum interval. The Ngaglik Study is not unlike a
clinical trial, therefore, where each subject contributes certain background information and monthly information on
breastfeeding behavior. Failure is
defined as the return of menses postpartum and individuals are censored if lost
to follow-up or the study terminated before menses returns. The underlying assumption in the model is that heterogeneity is captured by the set of covariates
considered for analysis, and relative
risks remain constant over the duration
of the amenorrheic interval.

Details of the formulation of hazard
models can be found elsewhere (e.g.,
Cox, 1972; Kalbfleisch and Prentice,
1980; Trussell and Hammerslough,
1983). Briefly, the hazard function 1s denoted by A(t, z) and is given by,

A(t,z) = d(Hexp(Bz), (1)

where A(t,z) represents the instantaneous failure rate of postpartum amenorrhea at time ¢ for a woman with a vector
of covariates z, 8 is a vector of unknown
regression coefficients to be estimated,
and d,(t) is an arbitrary nonnegative,
unspecified baseline hazard function not
dependent on the covariates. Cox
(1972) obtained estimates of 8 and an
asymptotic covariance matrix using a
partial likelihood argument. The methods and computer program used to estimate Cox’s model in the present study
were BMDP-2L (Dixon, 1985).

The model assumes that all women
with the same covariates have identical

312

risks of returning to menses over the
course of the study, but these risks may
vary among groups with different covariates. When the model is estimated,
an arbitrary baseline hazard function
(2) is calculated for a specified reference group. The hazard function enables one to estimate the relative risks of
the other groups in relation to this baseline group by exponentiating the regression coefficients, exp(B). Each exponential of the coefficients exp($) in
Equation (1) represents the effect of the
covariate on the hazard function for the
reference group. When there are no
covariates present the exp(®) reduces to
unity. Values greater than 1 indicate
that the relative risk of resumption of
menses postpartum is greater for this
group, compared with the reference
group, while values less than 1 indicate a
decrease in the risk.

The appropriateness of the assumption of proportional hazards, implicit in
the use of multiplicative hazard models
such as this, can be tested graphically by
plotting /n{-In(proportion remaining
amenorrheic)| for the various covariate
categories (Kalbfleisch and Prentice,
1980), or more formally, by allowing the
covariates to vary as a function of time
(Cox, 1972, p. 189). If the inclusion of
the time-dependent covariate does not
provide a significantly better fit to the
data than that achieved by the original
model, the effects of the explanatory
variables are independent of the times at
which failures occur. If on the other
hand, a time-dependent covariate
should prove significant, it can be included in the specification of the model.

One-way analysis of variance was
used to assess difference between
breastfeeding variables for the various
groupings considered.

RESULTS

BREASTFEEDING MODEL

The recall data on breastfeeding in
the study were numerical and continuous. To make the results comparable to
those of other studies of the effects of
breastfeeding on resumption of menses
postpartum, the data were categorized.
To do this, the product-limit life table
method was applied initially to the quartiles for each of the three primary variables, minutes per nursing bout, number
of day-time nursing bouts, and number
of night-time nursing bouts. Optimum
splits were obtained by the successive
application of the product-limit life table around the quartiles and collapsing
categories which were not significantly
different from one another. Two optimum categories were found for each
variable. For minutes per nursing bout,
these were <6 minutes and >6 minutes.
For number of day-time nursing bouts,
the categories were <6 times and >6
times a day. Finally, for number of
night-time nursing bouts, the optimum
categories were <3 times and >3 times
at night.

Cross-classification by these three
variables at their optimums results in a
2X 2x2 table with 8 cells. These 8
cells, the fully saturated model, represent different breastfeeding patterns for
this sample of women. For example, at
one extreme, are those women who
breastfed on average with the least intensity for each nursing variable. These
values were <6 minutes per bout, <6
times during the day-time hours, and <3
times at night. This group of women had
a median resumption of menses of 11.47
months (N = 17). At the other extreme
were those women who nursed on aver

age with the highest intensity. These val
ues were >6 minutes per bout, >6 times

a day, and >3 times a night. This group

of women had a median resumption of

menses of 20.35 months (N = 61).

However, after applying life table analy
sis to the table and collapsing those cells

which did not differ significantly from

one another, only 4 different breast
feeding groups or “patterns” emerged.

These results are summarized in Table 1
= along with the nursing variables for this
breastfeeding model. Figure 1 presents
Sthe survival functions for the four
obreastfeeding groups. At the upper exAtreme for breastfeeding, the “high intensity” group was the same. At the
lower extreme, those women who
cobreastfed <6 minutes per bout, <3
times at night, and >6 times during the
raday (N = 22); and those women who
Sobreastfed <6 minutes per bout, <6
Stimes a day, and >3 times at night
2(N = 2), both had early resumption of
Omenses at medians of 10.78 and 4.83
S months, respectively. Because these

who breastfed >6 minutes per bout, but

menses of 14.01 months and were designated as ‘‘medium-low intensity”’
breastfeeders (N = 81). Those women
who breastfed <6 minutes per bout, but
both >3 times at night and >6 times
during the day (N = 14); those who
breastfed >6 minutes per bout, >6

times during the day, but <3 times at
night (N = 6); and those who breastfed
>6 minutes per bout, >times at night,
but <6 times a day (N = 179), had medians for resumption of menses of 16.70,
16.50, and 17.95 months, respectively.
These three groups, combined, resumed menses at a median of 17.65
months and were designated as
“medium-high intensity’’ breastfeeders
(N = 199). The survival functions for
these four breastfeeding groups were
significantly different overall (Model
Generalized Wilcoxon = 54.713,
p <0.001), and for paired comparisons
(Table 1). The category labels (low,
medium-low, etc.) are used here merely
as convenient labels to refer to overall
patterns for breastfeeding for the vanious combinations of the three primary
variables.

From Table 1 we can see that, on average, over the postpartum period, low
intensity and high intensity breastfeeders differed significantly from one
another for all the breastfeeding variables. For the medium-low and mediumhigh groups the difference in the total
number of nursing bouts over the 24hour period was due to the difference in
both the number of day- and night-time
bouts between these two groups. These
differences are also reflected in the difference in the total minutes of nursing
per 24-hour and the total minutes of
nursing at night between these two intermediate groups. The lack of significance differences in total minutes of nursing per day between medium-low and
medium-high breastfeeding mothers is
due to the medium-low group having
nursed on average more minutes per
bout, while the medium-high group
nursed with a higher frequency during
the day-time.

These different breastfeeding patoterns are more clearly evidenced by the
atterns of monthly nursing behavior
Sover the postpartum interval for the four
breastfeeding groups (Figure 2). The
medium-low group had the lowest values for both number of day-time and
number of night-time nursing bouts, but
they also had the highest values for minutes per nursing bout. In contrast, the
low intensity group had consistently low
values for each of the three primary
breastfeeding variables over the postpartum period. This pattern resulted in
the lowest median resumption of postpartum menses at just over 11 months,
while the medium-low group was signi

ficantly higher at 14 months, The high
intensity group had values which were
consistently high, although not necessarily the highest, for each of the primary nursing variables resulting in the
highest median resumption of menses at
just over 20 months. The medium-high
group had values consistently high for
both night-time nursing bouts and minutes per nursing bout, but the values for
day-time nursing bouts were significantly lower than the monthly values
for the high intensity group. This pattern of breastfeeding resulted in an intermediate level for resumption of
menses at a median of approximately
17/2 months.

Several recent studies which were designed to investigate the relationships
between breastfeeding behavior and return of postpartum fecundity have used
the total number of nursing bouts per
24-hour or the total minutes of nursing
per 24-hour as measures of breastfeeding behavior (Delvoye et al., 1977;
Delgado et al., 1982), or the total number of nursing bouts during the day-time
hours only (Huffman et al., 1980). Figure 3 points to some of the difficulties
which might arise in interpreting these
kinds of data. For example, from Figure
3 it can be seen that the medium-low intensity group had the lowest values for
total number of nursing bouts in 24
hours. Also, the low intensity and
medium-high intensity groups were not
significantly different from one another
for this same measure of breastfeeding
behavior. However, the low intensity
group did have the lowest values over
the postpartum period for total minutes
of nursing per 24-hour. Also, the low
and high intensity groups were significantly different from one another for
total minutes of nursing during the daytime hours over the postpartum period,

Fic 2 —Primary breastfeeding variables and sample sizes at monthly durations postpartum for four

breastfeeding groups

but the two intermediate groups did not
differ significantly from one another for
this variable. In a similar fashion, the
low and high intensity breastfeeding
groups were significantly different from
one another for total minutes of nursing
during the night-time hours, but the
medium-high and high intensity groups
were not significantly different from one
another for this variable. These results
indicate that all three of the primary
breastfeeding variables, that is, minutes
per nursing bout, number of day-time
nursing bouts, and number of night-time
nursing bouts, from which the model
presented in Table 1 is derived, are necessary to adequately distinguish the behavioral effects of breastfeeding on resumption of menses postpartum in this
population. Any one of the three primary variables alone, or their first-order
interactions (expressed here as total

 

number bouts in 24-hour, total minutes/
day, total minutes/night, or total minutes in 24-hour), does not adequately
account for the variability in resumption
of postpartum menses.

MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS

The adequacy of the breastfeeding
model presented here for understanding
the relationship between nursing behavior and resumption of menses postpartum can be further examined through
the use of the proportional hazards
model. In Table 2 the hazard coefficients B and exp(8) are presented for
two main effects with interactions
models for the three primary nursing
variables. The first model contains the
three main effects and one interaction
term, while Model 2 introduces age as
an additional covariate. Model 3

presents the breastfeeding model derived above, while Model 4 introduces
age as an additional covariate into this
model as well. The proportionality assumption was tested in each model by
plotting /n[-in(survivor function)] for
the various categories. In addition, a
simple function of time (t-f) was introduced as an added test and in all cases no
significant departures from proportionality were found.

The results for the main effects and
interaction models have been presented
elsewhere (Jones, 1988). Briefly, for
comparative purposes inere, in the main
effects plus interactions models (Models
1 and 2), the coefficients were tested for

statistical significance, and in both, the
three primary breastfeeding variables
were found to be significant. In addition, the interaction of number of daytime and night-time nursing bouts approached significance, but the
coefficient was negative. Younger age,
here designated as less than 30 years,
was also shown to be significantly related to earlier resumption of menses
postpartum.

Models 3 and 4 present the results for
the behavioral model for breastfeeding
derived in this paper. The coefficients
for the low intensity, medium-low intensity, and medium-high intensity breastfeeding behavior variables were all

found to be significant. In addition,
Models 1 and 3 have nearly equivalent
model chi-squares, and as such, can be
seen as being equally efficient in explaining the effect of breastfeeding on
resumption of postpartum menses.
While main effects models or main effects plus interactions models might be
seen as being more parsimonious in a
statistical sense, Model 3 is easier to understand in terms of human behavior
and is preferred here. For example, the
importance of the negative coefficient
for the interaction of day-time and
night-time nursing bouts in Model 1,
when both their main effects are positive, is present in Model 3 as well. But
the effect is present in the medium-low
intensity breastfeeding group. These
women breastfed on average <6 minutes per nursing bout. Minutes per bout
for these women averaged just over 9
minutes, the longest for any of the
breastfeeding groups (Table 1). While
the first two main effects increase the
risk of early resumption of menses
(+ coefficients), nursing for more minutes per bout offset these effects somewhat when the effects are considered simultaneously (— coefficient for the
interaction). Because they breastfed for
a greater number of minutes per bout,
women in the medium-low group were
at a lower risk of early resumption of
menses compared to Jow intensity
breastfeeding mothers who did not.

In the behavior model for breastfeeding in Table 1 (Model 3), with the three
behavior variables considered simultaneously, an exp() of 4.58 for those who
nursed their children with the lowest intensity means that their risk of menstruating is 4.58 times the risk of mothers
who nursed with the highest intensity,
other characteristics being the same.
For the two intermediate breastfeeding

Breastfeeding in Java

319

groups, the medium-low and mediumhigh breastfeeders, the risks of menstruating postpartum were 2.03 and 1.54
times, respectively, the risk for mothers
nursing with the highest intensity, other
variables being the same. The effect of
age on return to menses was also introduced into the behavioral model (Model
4). With age included, the effects of the
nursing behavior variables on return to
menses remained constant relative to
one another, as in Model 3, and significant overall; and age was found also to
be significant. An exp(®) of 1.78 for
women younger than 30 years of age
means that the effect of younger age was
to increase the risk of menstruating 1.78
times the risk for mothers 30 years or
older, other characteristics being the
case. Age had the same effect in the
main effect plus interactions model
(Model 2). As was the case with Models
1 and 3, Models 2 and 4 had nearly
equivalent model chi-squares. As such,
Model 4 can be seen as being equally efficient in explaining the effects of breastfeeding on resumption of postpartum
menses as the main effects model with
interactions. Finally, age did not interact significantly with any of the breastfeeding variables.

DISCUSSION

As mentioned above, studies which
have attempted to quantify the effects of
breastfeeding behavior on resumption
of postpartum fecundity and fertility are
still relatively few in number (see Huffman et al., 1987). Nonetheless, those
which have, provide convincing evidence that the period of lactational
amenorrhea is dependent on the suckling input in a dose-dependent fashion.
The most convincing evidence derives
from recent longitudinal, small-scale

320

clinical studies in Edinburgh, Scotland
(Howie and McNeilly, 1982). Howie
and McNeilly and coworkers have
shown that a suckling frequency of more
than 5 times and a total duration of
breastfeeding of more than 65 minutes
(minimum, 10 minutes per feeding
bout) each day was sufficient to maintain complete suppression of ovarian activity for over a year in this Western setting. Reductions below these critical
levels were associated with the introduction of supplementary foods, less frequent night-time nursing, and subsequently, earlier onset of ovulation and
menstruation. However, even when
supplements were introduced early in
the postpartum period, ovulation and
menstruation remained suppressed if
suckling was maintained at high frequencies for long durations (total minutes of nursing per day) (McNeilly et al.,
1982, 1983; Howie et al., 1981, 1982a,
b).

In the present study, breastfeeding
patterns were maintained at relatively
constant levels by the Javanese mothers
over the postpartum period. This was
seen in spite of a pattern of early supplementation which has been shown to alter breastfeeding behavior in other studies. The dose-dependent nature of the
suckling stimulus in this population is,
therefore, seen in the pattern for median resumption of menses across the
different breastfeeding groups. The four
breastfeeding groups in this study depict
the range of nursing behavior and its effect on fecundity. Women who nursed
Jess frequently during the day-time or
night-time hours, or with fewer minutes
per bout, had, on average, shorter durations of postpartum amenorrhea than
those women who nursed more frequently or with more minutes per nursing bout. However, it appears that the

Jones

Social Biology

combination of these breastfeeding factors is more important than any single
factor alone. These combinations translate into patterns of relative consistency
in the suckling stimulus during a 24-hour
period over the postpartum duration of
lactational amenorrhea. At the extremes, high intensity and low intensity
breastfeeding represent the most and
the Jeast amount of consistency in the
suckling stimulus. When all three of
these primary breastfeeding variables
occurred together at their maximum values, resumption of menses was postponed the longest; when all three occurred in their minimum values, menses
resumed the earliest. In between, various combinations of these breastfeeding
patterns produced intermediate levels
for resumption of menses postpartum.
For example, women in the mediumlow breastfeeding group who maintained low frequencies of nursing during
both the night-time and day-time hours,
had the risk of early resumption of
menses partially offset because they
nursed for more minutes per bout.
While there is clearly overlap between
these groups, and therefore unexplained variability in the model, the
overlap is most pronounced in the intermediate groups. At the upper extreme,
for the 61 high intensity breastfeeders,
the earliest resumption of menses was at
71/2 months, and only 5 women in this
group resumed menstruation within one
year (before 361 days). The comparable
figure for the earliest onset of menses for
the other three groups was, on average,
21/2 months. When age is taken into account among the high intensity breastfeeding group, the results are even more
pronounced. The earliest resumption of
menses for women in the 15—29 age category for high intensity breastfeeders
was 71/2 months, while for women 30

Vol. 35, No. 3-4

years or older in this breastfeeding
group the earliest resumption was at
121/2 months. The finding of a strong independent effect of mother’s age on return of menses has not been consistently
reported in the literature. Maternal age
has been found to influence the duration
of lactational amenorrhea in the Philippines, India, and Bangladesh, with
younger women having shorter durations than older women (Chen et al.,
1974; Jain and Sun, 1972; Potter et al.,
1965). However, it is not clear from
these studies whether this effect is independent of other factors since breastfeeding behavior was not explicitly controlled. In the study presented here,
since the breastfeeding effect was controlled in the multivariate hazard analysis, the age effect reflects some biological or physiological mechanism, unrelated, at least directly, to the frequency
or intensity of breastfeeding.

The present study contributes to our
understanding of the biobehavioral
mechanisms responsible for postpartum
amenorrhea in breastfeeding women. It
shows that the type of nursing behavior
practiced by breastfeeding mothers is an
important determinant of the resumption of menses postpartum. What has
not been attempted, is to show which
groups of women, for example, either
women who are highly educated or not,
wealthy or not, or of some other socioeconomic grouping, are most likely to
practice the types of breastfeeding behaviors identified as important determinants of return of postpartum fecundity.
This research will be presented elsewhere. ;

The results presented here demonstrate that further research of the breastfeeding effects on resumption of postpartum fecundity should include a
combination of measures of nursing be

havior, rather than just the total minutes
of nursing per day or the frequency of
nursing per day which are often reported in these types of studies. This is
probably most critical for night-time
nursing patterns. That a combination of
breastfeeding factors or variables, including night-time feeding, is more important than any one measure alone has
been shown in other studies as well
(Elias et al., 1987; Howie and McNeilly,
1982; Rivera et al., 1984).

In addition, the analysis demonStrates the utility of hazards model
methodology as a multivariate technique for prospective interval studies
such as the one presented here. By their
very nature, these studies tend to have
limited sample sizes, relatively large
numbers of covariates, and censored observations. Hazard models appear to be
the most efficient way to handle such
data.
