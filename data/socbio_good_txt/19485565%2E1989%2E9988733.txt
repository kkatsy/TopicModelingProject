ABSTRACT: A study of factors influencing genetic counseling attendance rate has been
conducted in the Bouches-du-Rho6ne area, in the south of France. In this area, a birth defects
monitoring system (Eurocat n°22) annually covers 23,000 births. All the genetic services are
delivered by only one genetic center located in Marseilles, and the data collected are
computerized. The comparison of these two data bases gives an opportunity to estimate the rate
of genetic counseling attendance after the occurrence of an affected stillbirth or live birth.
Among the parents of 358 infants born in 1983-84 in this area with a pathology requiring
genetic counseling, 226 (63 per cent) attended the Genetic Center within the first year after
birth. The rate of attendance is statistically higher (p < 0.01) for the parents who had a stillbirth
(78 per cent) than for those who had a live birth (57 per cent). It is also higher (p < 0.01) for the
Marseilles maternities group (68 per cent) than for the group outside Marseilles (50 per cent).
The referral delays are also analyzed according to malformation etiology and to viability of the
child by the eighth day of life. Besides evaluating a particular genetic center’s effectiveness in
diffusing information to the public concerned, this work shows that couples’ request is strongly
dependent on a psychological need.

Genetic counseling and consultation
at prenatal diagnosis clinics are now, in
most Western countries, accepted procedures for the prevention of birth defects. Whether genztic counseling contributes to prevent recurrences by
influencing reproductive choices of
couples is still argued (Wertz and Sorenson, 1986; Chase et al., 1987). Theoretically, genetic counseling should help
consultees in understanding medical
facts, including the diagnosis, in appreciating the way heredity contributes to
the disorder, in selecting the course of
action which seems appropriate to them
in view of their risk of recurrence, in

making the best adjustment to their
problem, and in choosing the way their
next pregnancy can be managed (Sorensonetal., 1981). After the birth of an index child with a severe defect, genetic
counseling will decrease anxiety for the
majority of couples as the contribution
of genetics to most birth defects is small.
Ideally, all the couples should attend a
genetic counseling clinic in the months
following the birth of an affected child.
In fact, only some of them attend such
clinics.

The objectives of this work were to
measure the genetic clinic attendance
rate during the first year after the birth

of an index case and to determine factors influencing this rate.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Two computerized data bases from
the same area in France (Bouches du
Rhoéne area including the city of Marseilles) were compared. The annual
number of births in this geographic area
is about 23,000.

The first data base is a birth defect
monitoring system (Eurocat, n° 22) running since January 1, 1983. Each birth
defect (gestational age > 19 weeks) ina
child or fetus whose parents are residents of the Bouches-du-Rhone area is
reported to the register. These include
only birth defects which are detectable
at birth. Spontaneous notifications are
complemented with systematic surveys
of hospital case notes, prenatal diagnosis, and cytogenetic and post-mortem
examination reports, The chart includes
child identification, the main clinical
symptoms, and the names of physicians
in charge of the mother and/or child. Diagnostic conclusions and a summary of
the information on the risks of recurrence, frequency of the disease, and
availability of prenatal diagnosis procedures for this condition are sent by the
geneticist in charge of the register to
these physicians and to the maternity
hospital where the child was delivered.

The second data base, named GENTIC (Aymé et al., 1982), is composed of
the patient files obtained during genetic
counseling; for the Bouches du Rhone
area, there is only one genetic and prenatal diagnosis center, at Marseilles, delivering clinical and technical procedures (karyotypes, amniocentesis, etc.)
It is thus possible to know exactly, and
for the whole area, which parents of affected children have attended the genetic center.

Genetic Counseling

241

The present study was carried out on
the cases born in 1983—84 and reported
to the birth defects monitoring system.
The couples who had attended genetic
counseling or prenatal diagnosis clinics
before the birth of the affected child
were excluded since they could be considered as already informed. For all the
other cases reported, a list of the diagnoses for which referral to a genetic clinic
was medically justified has been established according to the final diagnosis on
their file (Table 1). This list was defined
according to two criteria corresponding
to the role of the genetic consultation.
The first criterion is related to the existence of a severe birth defect either completely or partially of genetic origin. The
second criterion is the availability of a
prenatal diagnosis in case of recurrence
of the birth defect in the next pregnancy.
Availability of prenatal diagnosis has
been classified as possible or not possible according to the current state of
knowledge (Mattéi et al., 1986).

Among the group of parents of malformed or stillborn children born in 1983
and 1984 and defined according to the
three previous criteria, the Genetic
Center data bases made it possible to
differentiate between those who attended the genetic clinic during the first
year after birth and those who did not.
First, four variables were analyzed for
each group: the risk of recurrence of the
defect, the availability of prenatal diagnosis for next pregnancies, the viability
of the child at birth, and the birth place
(maternity inside or outside Marseilles).
Secondly, for the group of parents who
attended the genetic clinic during the
first year after birth, the delay between
birth and clinic dates has been analyzed
in respect to the child’s viability at birth.
The statistics used for comparison of
proportions were chi-square tests.

ATTENDANCE RATE AT GENETIC CLINICS

Among the parents of 358 children
born in 1983 and 1984 in the Bouches du
Rhéne region with a pathology which
should require genetic counseling, 226
(63 per cent) attended Marseilles Genetic Center by the end of the first year
after birth.

Table 2 shows the genetic clinic attendance rates according to heredity
and to viability at birth. The genetic
clinic attendance rate was statistically
higher (p < 0.01) for the group of parents who had a stillbirth (78 per cent)
than for the parents who had a malformed live birth (57 per cent). The difference was not significant if the defect
was of genetic origin (high risk group)
but was highly significant for the low risk

as the group of pathologies with a recurrence risk higher or equivalent to 10 per
cent and the low risk group was defined
as the group of pathologies with a recurrence risk lower than 10 per cent. The
diagnoses are detailed in Table 1 by etiological categories.

Availability of a prenatal diagnosis
procedure does not seem to influence
the attendance rate (Table 3). Genetic
clinic attendance rate according to
child’s birth place was 68 per cent for
Marseilles maternities and 50 per cent
for maternities outside Marseilles
(p < 0.01).

GENETIC CLINIC ATTENDANCE DELAYS

For all the attending couples and
whatever the nature of the pathology, 82

per cent of the consultations in clinics
took place by the end of the fourth
month following childbirth. There were,
however, some large variations between
attendance rates depending upon the
pathology. For chromosomal abnormalities, 92 per cent of the consultations
took place by the end of the first month,
and the total attendance in clinics was
processed by the end of the third month.

During the first month after birth, the
parents of live births attend genetics
clinics more often (70 per cent) than do
the parents of stillbirths (36 per cent)
(p < 0.01). This trend is reversed from
the third month, the attendance rate being higher for the parents of stillbirths.
Finally, even if the rates are significantly
different, the pattern of attendances becomes comparable for the two groups by
the end of the third month (Figure 1).

The pattern of attendance does not
significantly differ for the high risk
group as compared with the low risk
group (Figure 2).

DISCUSSION

The purpose of this study was to measure the attendance rate at genetic counseling clinics as an indicator of the need
for such clinics in the general health care
system. It was also to evidence factors
influencing this rate. The first goal was
easy to achieve, but the second one was
only partially reached as, in fact, couples’ attendance rate is a combination of
referral rate by physicians and couples’
wish and decision to attend such clinics.
With the data available, we were not
able to discriminate between these two
major factors.

In the Bouches-du-Rh6ne area, a letter containing information on etiology,
risk of recurrence, and availability of
prenatal diagnosis, is sent by the geneti

cist in charge of the Registry to every
physician either reporting a birth defect,
or in charge of a child with a birth defect
or of a woman having given birth to an
affected child. Because of the very special organization, it may be considered
that what is measured is more likely to
be the result of the couples’ decision
than the physician’s attitude and knowIledge. However, it is not possible to
affirm that the letter is the main determinant of attendance at the consultation
after birth. Another limit of this study is
the fact that we looked at the attendance
rate only within the year following
child’s birth whereas parents of living
children may consult later, their first
need being to cure the affected newborn.

Viability appears to be an additional
incentive for genetics clinic attendance.
The influence of infant’s viability at
birth or by the eighth day of life varies
with the nature of the pathology. For
high risk of recurrence pathologies
(Mendelian diseases) or for pathologies
recognized to be in the realm of genetics
(chromosomal diseases), a stillbirth
event does not intervene as a differentiating factor of attendance rate. On the
contrary, viability intervenes as a determinant factor when the etiology of the
pathology is non-Mendelian, i.e., witha
risk of recurrence lower than 10 per
cent. These results suggest that the psychological impact of the index-case occurrence intervenes more strongly on
parents’ motivations for attending genetic counseling when the fetus is stillborn than does the objective risk of recurrence. De Wals et al. (1986), in the
province of Hainaut, Belgium, where 51
per cent of the 182 stillbirths and perinatal deaths were autopsied, observed a
genetic counseling rate, after malformed stillbirth, equal to 78 per cent.

This percentage is in agreement with the
one observed in our series. In contrast,
Sadovnick et al. (1987), in a study about
use of genetic counseling services in
Canada for neural tube defects, found a
rate of live birth spina bifida referrals of
92 per cent (15/17), a rate of stillbirth
spina bifida referrals of 40 per cent (2/5),
and a rate of anencephalic births referrals of 45 per cent (121/223) for 1982-83.
Our results differ markedly since we
have 67 per cent for live birth spina
bifida, 62 per cent for stillbirth spina
bifida, and 79 per cent for anencephalies. If, in our study, genetic counseling
is most often sought after a stillbirth
with a neural tube defect, it is probably
because of the systematic post-mortem
examination and the personal letter addressed to the declaring physician.

The increasing rates of attendance
during the third and fourth months by
parents of stillbirths also suggest the impact this post-mortem examination has
on referrals. The difference in the rates
of attendance observed between parents
of stillbirths and live births may be explained by the fact that it takes at least
one or two months after a stillbirth for
autopsy results to be transmitted to physicians. As can be seen with the results
analyzed here, physician and patient do
ask for the expert advice of a geneticist
even when they have the conclusions of
the pathology report. Without such a
post-mortem protocol, it would be impossible to give the parents precise information on the causes of death. If the
overall rate of attendance for De Wals et
al. (1986) was 78 per cent for the malformed stillbirths, it was 93 per cent for
autopsied stillbirths and 23 per cent for
the non-autopsied ones. As mentioned
by these authors, the key to an adequate
diffusion of genetics services is physicians’ attitudes. An editorial, ‘“The ab
Social Biology

horrence of stillbirth” (1977), underlines that “‘the immediate goal is for a
taboo to be broken, for stillbirth to be
recognized as a common crisis which
calls for immediate and long term support for the family”. Kowalski (1980)
also insists on the role of professionals in
managing perinatal loss. In general, if
women have a very favorable attitude
toward the extension of prenatal diagnosis indications (Doherty and
Roghmann, 1979), the context is very
different for physicians (Julian, 1986;
Lippman-Hand and Piper, 1981;
Lippman-Hand and Cohen, 1980;
Weitz, 1979). However, our results suggest that the barriers to the diffusion of
information about prenatal diagnosis
are reduced if the physician is directly
confronted with the parents of an index
case and if he is adequately informed
about the genetic components of the pathology.

The attendance rates observed in this
study are applicable only to the Bouches
du Rho6ne area with its particular health
care organization and for a certain period of time. We would need to do other
studies to compare the values observed.
The conclusions about the impact of
stillbirth occurrence is however generalizable to every provider of genetics services and underlines the need for a diagnostic protocol followed by genetic
expertise when necessary, but also for
psychological help for the parents. An
extension of genetic counseling diffusion to couples with an affected child requires particular attention to improving
physician’s information, particularly on
non-Mendelian pathologies.
