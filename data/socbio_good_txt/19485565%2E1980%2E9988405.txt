The Effect of Variable Progeny Size and Social
Selection on the Population Dynamics of Rare Lethal

Genes

ABSTRACT: When a family has a member affected by a rare lethal genetic disease, the norma! members of the family have a reduced chance of marrying or of reaching the fertility level of the general
population. This paper shows that gene frequency change is divided approximately into two parts:
the change due to individual selection and that due to social pressure. It is also shown that a large
progeny size in a family generally decreases the equilibrium of lethal genes because of social pres
sure.

In human populations, it has often
been observed that family structure has an
important role in the determination of
fitness of an individual. Huntington’s disease is an example. Reed and Neel (1959)
showed that when a family has affected individuals selection operates against all the
sibs even those with normal genotypes.

Such social selection has been studied
mathematically for rare deleterious genes
(Yokoyama, 1980; Yokoyama and Templeton, 1980). We have shown that social
selection has an important role in the population dynamics of deleterious genes and
that the equilibrium gene frequency depends strongly on the magnitude of social
selection.

In these papers, we have assumed that
each family has a large number of offspring. However, progeny size is often
limited and the variance in progeny size
could be substantial. Therefore, it is important to know the effect of variable
progeny size on the population dynamics
of rare deleterious genes. In this paper, I
shall consider the population dynamics of
lethal genes under the joint effect of individual selection and social selection with
variable progeny sizes.

DETERMINISTIC CHANGE OF
GENE FREQUENCIES

We consider a mutant gene a and its
wild type allele A in a population. We assume that only individuals of genotype aa
develop the trait. Let us consider the processes of mating, reproduction, and selection, in that order. Let us distinguish five
classes: (1) a group of individuals of genotype AA who have no affected individuals
within the nuclear family, (AA),; (2) those
whose genotypes are AA, but have at least
one affected individual within the nuclear
family, (AA),; (3) those of genotype Aa
who have no affected family members,
(Aa),; (4) those of genotypes Aa who have
at least one affected individual within the
family, (Aa),; and (5) those of genotypes
aa who are phenotypically abnormal,
(aa).

In individual selection, we assume that
the relative viabilities of the genotypes
AA, Aa, and aa are 1, 1—h and 0, respectively. Suppose that the frequencies of
genotypes AA, Aa, and aa after individual
selection are P, Q, and R, respectively.
Let q be the frequency of allele a among
adults. Thus, P=1-—2q, Q=2q, and

Vol. 27, No. 1

R=0. Furthermore, let k, be the relative
frequency of AA individuals who have at
least one affected individual in the nuclear
family. Similarly, let k, be the relative frequency of Aa individuals in the affected
nuclear family. Thus, the frequencies of
(AA),, (AA),, (Aa),, (Aa),, and (aa)
among adults are (1—k,)P, k,P, A-k,)Q,
k,)O, and 0, respectively.

In mating, we assume that the amount
of reduction in mating success or in fertility for an individual in the classes (AA),
and (Aa), is w, due to social impact. Since
only individuals with genotypes AA and
Aa participate in the mating, the newly
born individuals can be classified as (AA),
or (Aa), only when they have aa individuals in the family. Thus, the classes (AA),
and (Aa), arise from the matings between
two heterozygous individuals. Let us now
denote the probabilities of progeny of
(AA),, (AA),, (Aa),, (Aa@),, and (aa) from
the matings between two heterozygous individuals as D,, D,, D,, D,, and 0.25, respectively (see Table 1). It should be
noted that D, + D, = 0.25 and D, + D,

EVALUATION OF D, ann D,

It is generally accepted that the negative binomial distribution provides a good
fit to observed progeny size distribution
(e.g.,see Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer,
1971). Therefore, we shall assume that the
progeny size in each family follows the
negative binomial distribution. Let X be
the number of offspring in the family. The

Variable Progeny Size

73
distribution of X is given by
P, = Pr(X =x)
_,(ntx-Dl,syx
x!(n—1)! (7) , CS)
for x=0,1,2, ... where t=1+5. It has

been observed that n=2~6 and
s=0.6~2.2 (see Table 6-11 in CavalliSforza and Bodmer, 1971).

Let D(x) be the value of D, for X=x,
i=2 and 4. Note that the probabilities of
genotypes AA, Aa, and aa from the mating between two heterozygotes are 0.25,
0.50, and 0.25, respectively. Thus, D,(1)
= Qand D,(1) =0. Let us consider the case
of X =2. (AA), is produced only when one
sib is AA and another is aa with probability 2(0.25). Since one of these children
belongs to (AA),, D, (2) = (0.25). (Aa),
is obtained when one sib is Aa and another
is aa. This probability is (2) (0.50)(0.25).
Since one of the two has the genotype Aa,
D,(2) = (0.50)(0.25). Continuing the
same procedure, we can see that for X =x

In the computation of D, and D, , we
only consider the case of x=1 and

D, = 2 D(x)P,/(1- 17"),

where P. is given in Equation (13). Then
we can show that

Since it is not easy to simplify D, and D,,
the numerical computations for D, and D,
have been done for reasonable values of 11
ands:

n = 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0;
s = 0.6, 1.0, 1.4, 2.0, and 2.4.

 

Social Biology

Results are shown in Table 2. We see that
the values of D, and D, increase when n
ands increase. When the number of progeny in a family is large, the mating between two heterozygotes is hkely to produce aa individuals. Then, all other sibs
are classified as either (AA), or (Aa), . Under the condition, D, =0, D,=0.25, D,
=(), and D, =0.50. Consider the case of
n=6.0 and s=2.2 in Table 2. We can see
that D,=0.2263 and D,=0.4525, and we
find that these values aresufficiently close
to the values D,=0.25 and D,=0.50. We
have seen that the value of D, is especially
interesting because the effect of progeny
distribution on the gene frequency change
is only through D.. For realistic combinations of n and s, D, is about 0.1 ~ 0.3.
Thus, the finiteness of offspring number in
a family reduces the value of D, from 20 to
40 per cent compared to that for an
infinitely large number of offspring, where
D,=0.50.

EQUILIBRIUM GENE FREQUENCY

Let us now consider the mutational
change from A to a with probability u in
each generation. Then the gene frequency
change is given approximately by

q[h + (1 - 2h)q]
49= — “TEI Ihq

When A>0, the equilibrium gene frequency does not depend on either D, or w.
Otherwise, the equilibrium gene frequency becomes smaller for a strong social
selection and larger progeny size.

DISCUSSION

J have shown that the equilibrium frequency of lethal genes is generally inversely related to the value of D, (see Equation
[16]). Numerical computation shows that
the value of D, increases as the progeny
size gets larger. Thus, the equilibrium frequency of lethal genes becomes small for a
large number of offspring in a family
through social pressure. So far our discussion is restricted to an infinitely large population. In reality, however, the size of a

population is always finite. It is important,
therefore, to study the population
dynamics of lethal genes in a finite population. To derive the stationary distribution
of gene frequencies in a finite population,
we must know the mean, M,, Vey of gene
frequency change per generation (Wright,
1938). In the present case.

Following Wright’s (1938) general formula, we find the frequency distribution

where C is determined by the relationship
of

['s@aq- I.

_ When

h>y(1+2D,w)u/2,

the mean and variance of gene frequencies
are given approximately by u/h and
ul/4Nh?. Thus, when individual selection
operates as a partially recessive, the variable progeny size does not affect the population dynamics of rare deleterious genes.

When
h<y(l+ 2D, w)u/4 ,

the mean and variance of gene frequencies
are given by

T(2Nu +4) /|V2N(1 + 2D,w) T(2Nu)

and u/(1+2D,w), approximately. In this
case, the equilibrium gene frequency decreases as N decreases. Therefore, strong
viability selection against allele a, large
number of progeny in a family, and small
population size generally decrease the
equilibrium frequency of allele a.

The extension of the single locus
analysis to common diseases has been
done with some restrictions (Yokoyama,
1980). Morton (1978) suggests that about
one-sixth of mental retardation in children
of matings of normal parents could be due
to rare recessive genes. Suppose that the
trait is controlled by rare deleterious alleles at 7 loci. Let us assume that the trait
is expressed whenever an individual has at
least one homozygous locus for lethal
genes. Then, assuming linkage equilibria
among n loci, the mating frequency between two individuals who have at least
one heterozygote locus is given by

Social Biology

1 [J [1- (24° | = 4 > g; = 4ng’,

i=!

where @ is defined in Equation (16) for an
infinitely large population. Furthermore,
the sum of the frequencies of offspring
with affected sibs from this mating is about
D, + D,. Thus, the frequency of phenotypically normal individuals who are subjected to social selection is given by 4n (D,
+ D,)q@, where g is given in Equation
(16). In this model, the population incidence of the trait is given by

1— IT (1-4?) = Baim ng’.

Suppose that the trait is caused by the
genetic mechanism described here and
that the population incidence is 0.01.
When h=0.0, the number of loci, n, is
given approximately by 0.01/u=10 for
u = 10-°. Because of its restrictive assumptions, the present model may not apply to common diseases directly. But, it is
possible to consider a similar genetic
mechanism for these diseases. For example, the rather high population incidence
of schizophrenia may be explained by the
balance between selection and mutation
with multiple loci, without assuming an
extremely high mutation rate as proposed
previously (Book, 1953; Penrose, 1956;
Kishimoto, 1957).

In the study of social selection, the estimation of w becomes important. So far,
not many studies have been done in this
area. For the Huntington’s disease data in
Reed and Neel (1959), w has been estimated to be about 0.2. (see Yokoyama
and Templeton, 1980). For schizophrenia,
Lindelius (1970) has shown that normal
sibs of schizophrenic probands have a
marital fertility of 83 per cent of that in the
general population. More recently, Buck
et al. (1975) have observed a slight reduction in the proportion of ever-married in
 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

Vol. 27, No. 1

dividuals in both brothers and sisters of
probands compared to the general population. They also observed a slightly lower
rate of marital fertility among the sisters of
probands than among the general population of women. They claim that the fertility of nonschizophrenic sisters is 93 per
cent of that in the general population.

-These studies indicate that the values of w

are about 0.05-0.20. However, Erlenmeyer-Kimling (1978) did not see any differences between the reproductivity of
sibs and those in the control group.

In their studies on mental retardation,
Reed and Reed (1965) found no
significant difference in reproduction between that of normal persons from sibships including a retardate and their normal first cousins from sibships without
retardates. However, our preliminary
analysis of the data in Reed and Reed
(1965) indicates that the normal individual

Variable Progeny Size 77

from an affected nuclear family has a
somewhat lower chance of marrying than
an individual from a normal nuclear family. No definite conclusion can yet be
drawn from this preliminary finding. The
data are very extensive, and more detailed
analysis on social response to the disease
needs to be done.

We are still in the early stages of understanding the social impacts of both rare
and common genetic diseases. In the future, it is expected that data on social responses to different diseases in different
regions will be accumulated.
