Hybridity Effect on Mortality

Studies of the effect of interracial crossing on fetal mortality in man have failed
to detect any effect due to hybridity of
the fetus (Morton et al., 1967). In a recent analysis of the effects of minor outcrossing on fetal mortality in Rhode
Island Caucasians, Bresler (1970) reported
an increase of 2.5 to 3 per cent fetal loss
“with each additional country of birth in
the great-grandparental generation (P3).”
In order to further examine this question,
we have reanalyzed the data of Morton et
al. (1967) with respect to minor or intraracial hybridity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data were collected by Morton and
his coworkers from the birth records of the
state of Hawaii for 1948-58 inclusive
(Morton et al., 1967).

For the present study, the data were
divided into three subsamples: (1) Oriental, which includes Chinese, Japanese,
Koreans, and their hybrids; (2) Caucasoid,
which includes Caucasians (primarily U.S.
continental whites), Puerto Ricans, and
their hybrids; and (3) Hawaiian, which

contrasts Hawaiians and part-Hawaiians
with others (excluding Caucasians) and
the different hybrids.

Within each subsample, an index of hybridity was assigned to each record according to a diallele cross model (Morton
et al., 1967). As an example, the scheme
for the Oriental group is presented in Table 1. Values range from 0, for an incross,
to 1, for a cross between different ethnic
groups. The basic model then is the regression of fetal death on this index of
hybridity.

Because of large differences in sample
size, for instance between Caucasians and
Puerto Ricans, a variable reflecting the
proportion of, in this instance, Puerto
Rican ancestry was introduced into the
regression as a correction factor. In addition, all socioeconomic variables considered
by Morton et al. (1967)! which were
found significant by stepwise regression in
the present analysis were included in the
final regressions to eliminate their effect
on the fetal death rate. The same analysis
was then applied to neonatal deaths (less
than one month) and to postneonatal in

parity, father’s occupation, father in armed
forces, urban residence, and some of their products
and powers.

While hybridity does show a highly significant effect in the Hawaiian group when
fitted alone, this effect disappears when
socioeconomic differences are controlled.
However, in both the intraracial groups
(Oriental and Caucasoid), the effect of

partial regression coefficients and corresponding values of ¢ = b/o». No significant
effect of hybridity on fetal death was
evident in any of the three groups. It is
of some interest that the effect in all groups,
although not significantly different from
zero, is negative, showing decreased fetal
mortality with increasing hybridity. This
is contrary to Bresler’s result, which gives
internal evidence of inadequate control
over socioeconomic factors in anamnestic
material (Morton, 1974).

hybridity fails to reach significance even
before correction for socioeconomic differences. Since it seems unlikely that these
two samples of 55,995 and 44,835 pregnancy terminations would fail to detect
an effect as large as that reported by Bresler (1970), this study does not support the
model he proposes.

With respect to neonatal mortality, the
effect of hybridity presents a somewhat
different picture. The intraracial comparisons show no significant effect of hybridity,

while the Hawaiian analysis shows a very
highly significant positive effect of hybridity. Further examination of the data
revealed this effect to be due to hybridity
of the mother, rather than the child, and
suggests to us that this may be due to an
uncontrolled bias due to the special environmental position of “Hawaiians” among
the major ethnic groups in Hawaii (Morton et al., 1967).

The results of the analysis of postneonatal infant mortality (which is extremely sensitive to environmental factors)
are even more heterogeneous. As can be
seen from Table 2, the Caucasoid sample
exhibits a highly significant positive effect
of hybridity on infant death. The Oriental
sample, on the other hand, shows no evidence of such an effect, while the Hawaiian
sample has a negative effect which approaches significance at the 0.05 level. Uncorrected for socioeconomic variables, the
Caucasian and Hawaiian samples show an
effect of hybridity which is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign (Caucasian,
b = + 0.0043 + 0.0019; Hawaiian, b =
— 0.0047 + 0.0018). We hesitate to assign
genetic significance to these results. It
must be remembered that this analysis
does not consider interfamily variation,
nor can it possibly provide perfect control
over environmental variables, whose measurement is subject to error. As Table 2

Freire-Maia, Stevenson, and Morton

shows, there is no consistent effect of hybridity on mortality, whether the error
is taken to be binomial (¥,7) or as residual
heterogeneity (F 3,3).

SUMMARY

An examination of the effect of hybridity on fetal, neonatal, and postneonatal
infant mortality is made in two intraracial samples, one Oriental (WV = 55,995)
and one Caucasoid (WV = 44,835), and one
interracial sample, Hawaiian with other
non-Caucasians (NV = 97,451). In the three
analyses of fetal mortality, the effect of
hybridity, although not significant, was
in the direction of decreased mortality.
There is no consistent effect of hybridity
on neonatal or postneonatal infant death.

These data on registered births, based on
very large samples and with covariance
analysis for socioeconomic variables, provide no support for Bresler’s hypothesis
that with increased mixture of gene pools,
fetal loss increases proportionately. It is
conjectured that his results were due to
inadequate control of nongenetic factors
in anamnestic data.
