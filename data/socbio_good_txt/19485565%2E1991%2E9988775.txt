Seasonality of Vital Events
in a Pacific Island Population

ABSTRACT: Analyses of vital data derived from a family record register for the native
population of Guam reveal significant variations in births, deaths, and marriages over the
period 1901-41. Although lacking marked photoperiod or temperature changes of temperate
zones, the tropical island is subject to marked seasonal differences in rainfall characteristic of
western Pacific islands. Marital patterns exhibit troughs associated respectively with the Lenten
period and with Christmas celebrations. Infant and childhood deaths show close
correspondence with rainfall patterns, consistently exceeding expected values during the rainy
season (July-November) when conditions are optimal for the spread of communicable and
gastrointestinal diseases. Births attain a peak in November, or at the beginning of the more
advantageous season for infant health and survival. Seasonality in vital events, reported for
many Euroamerican and some African and Asian populations of modern and historical
periods, has rarely been documented for native populations of the tropical Pacific.
Comparisons of differences in these patterns among different populations in varied
environments provide unique opportunities to evaluate causal models of interactions among

biological, sociocultural, and physioenvironmental factors.

T.S. Eliot notwithstanding, April
was not the cruelest month for the native
population of the western Pacific island
of Guam in the years before World War
II. Rather, it typically marked the ending of the more arid part of the fanomnagan, or dry season, from January or
February through June, a time when
trade winds kept temperatures at or
slightly below the mean annual figure of
about 80 degrees, and presaged the
coming period of somewhat more oppressive heat, rising in the 80’s, before
the monsoons brought the relative relief
of the fanuchanan season, its rains augmented from time to time by the deluges
of sometimes destructive typhoons, with
temperatures falling into the 70’s. Situated at about 13 degrees North latitude,
Guam has circum-annual changes in
photoperiod length that are barely no
ticeable, and the climate remains warm
and humid throughout the year.

The Hispanicized native population,
whose administration was assumed by
the United States Navy in 1898, depended almost entirely before World
War II on a subsistence economy based
on a wide range of native and introduced plants and crops collected from
uncultivated areas or grown and harvested throughout the year in house gardens and more distant ranchos. A succession of seasonal reef fish ensured an
available supply of protein all year long
which occasionally could be supplemented by domestic pigs or chickens.
Thus, native subsistence activities in this
unusually beneficent tropical setting
lacked any strong rhythm of alternating
periods of intensive labor and relative
leisure, and, except in the aftermath of

114

an occasional devastating typhoon, the
native Chamorro did not experience
marked cycles of great want or munificent plenty.

Under these circumstances, observed
seasonality in vital rates and secular
changes in these patterns would seem
unlikely to be related to any one of such
factors identified in other studies: cyclic
episodes of malnutrition or excessive
workload (Nurge, 1970; Mosher, 1979;
Bantje, 1988;Leslie and Fry, 1989); ritual restrictions on sexual behavior during planting times (Scaglion, 1976); a climatic “comfort” factor (Chang et al.,
1963; Parkes, 1976); the availability of
indoor heating (Momiyama, 1977);
marked socioeconomic differences (Pasamanick et al., 1960; Zelnick, 1969;
James, 1971; Chaudhury, 1972; Warren
and Tyler, 1979; Mitchell et al., 1985;
Steckel, 1985; Kastenbaum, 1987); migratory patterns (Menken, 1979; HussAshmore, 1988); ethnic differences
(Miura, 1987), religious-ceremonial
practices (Holland, 1989); or contraceptive practices (Rogers and Udry, 1988).
Rather, a complex of interacting biological, physical, and sociocultural factors
contributed to the probably universal
phenomenon of seasonality in vital rates
which now also is identified for this
unique island population in recent historic times.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

As described more fully elsewhere
(Underwood, 1990), a linked family register for the native population of Guam
has been developed from nineteenthcentury Spanish materials and the vital
registration records established by the
U.S. Navy administration in late 1901.
The latter recording system was interrupted upon the Japanese capture of the

island in December 1941, so that this
study is based primarily on information
for the years 1902 through 1940 and in
large part on data of survivorship and reproductive performance for 4,176 couples formally wed during this period. Categories of vital events (weddings,
first-births, ith order births, marriedadult deaths, infant and childhood
deaths) by month of event were summarized, adjusted for variation in length of
months, and in sequence corresponding
to rainfall seasonality, beginning with
February. Similarly arranged preliminary graphic representations of these
data, which showed other than a single
sinusoidal peak, precluded the use of
tests assuming sinusoidal tendency, harmonic, or one-pulse models. Accordingly, following Nonaka and Miura
(1987), I have relied on chi-square tests
with eleven degrees of freedom, despite
recognized limitations, and on graphic
presentations to identify and test for
significant seasonal differences in vital
events.

RESULTS

A summary of the results of analyses
(calculated seasonality indices, chisquare values, and significance levels) of
vital event data for Guam, adjusted for
length of month, for the period from
1902 through 1940, along with mean
rainfall in inches for the period 1956-72,
is shown in Table 1. Despite the high
value of the seasonality index for rainfall, monthly variation in precipitation is
only weakly statistically significant
(p = 0.05). Highest levels of statistical
significance (p = <0.001) are found for:
(1) monthly variations in first marriages,
i.€., Marriages involving previously unwed spouses; (2) childhood and infant
deaths and married-adult deaths, from

Vol. 38, No. 1-2

which data for 1918 are excluded due to
excessive mortality resulting from the
influenza pandemic in NovemberDecember of that year; and (3) for ith
order births of first and of all marriages.
This latter category refers to the last
child, second or higher birth order, born
to couples formally wed during the study
period. The statistical significance of
variation in birth month of firstborn children to all married couples (p = <0.01)
exceeds that for firstborns of previously
unwed spouses (p = <0.05), while no
statistical significance was found for variation in birth month of children born to
unwed mothers.

Normalized ratios were then calculated to provide comparisons with the
results of other studies and to facilitate
visual recognition of patterns from
graphic representations. A simple comparison of monthly ratios for rainfall and
matriage (Fig. 1) reveals the latter to
have two troughs (December, March)
during relative dry periods, but with
peaks also occurring during months of

Seasonality of Vital Events 115

relatively low rainfall (January, May).
A second comparison, between rainfall
and birth month of firstborn children of
first marriages (Fig. 2) also failed to suggest close association between this climatic variable and birth seasonality.
However, as shown in Figure 3, infant
and childhood deaths peaked during the
rainy season, while deaths among married adults were relatively more frequent at the end of that period and for
several months beyond, especially in
January.

Since other studies in noncontracepting groups (reviewed in Parkes, 1976,
and in Kevan, 1979, for example) have
sought an association between month of
marriage and conception (inferred by
subtracting nine months from date of
birth), directly or with some lag time, a
graphic representation of these factors
was prepared (Fig. 4), revealing one
trough in inferred conceptions in the
same month when marriages were most
frequent, but a peak one month after a
secondary peak frequency in marriages.

Finally, Figure 5, showing general similarities in seasonality of calculated
month of conceptions between first order and ith order births, questions initially any strong influence of marital
month and month of first successful conception, while the contrasting trend in
nonmarital conceptions—almost a mirror image of marital conceptions—
belies the operation of a general common environmental factor affecting
conceptions/births.

DISCUSSION

Although seemingly unrelated to climatic seasonality, for which rainfall
serves as primary index, marital seasonality is closely associated with the Catholic Church religious cycle and associated obligations. Peak marriage
periods, in January and May, surround

the Lenten period and “Promesa” obligations (Table 2) and the major trough
in March weddings. A secondary trough
in December coincides with the penitential season of Advent and the celebratory obligations of Christmas. If this interpretation is correct, secular decreases
in amplitude of marital seasonal patterns of peaks and troughs, as can be
seen in Figure 6, would predictably follow increased wage employment
(Mayo, 1988, pp. 56-57) and growth of
membership in Protestant churches
(Carano and Sanchez, 1961, pp. 399401).

Behavioral factors played a critical
role in the statistically weak association
observed between date of first marriage
and inferred month of conception of first
child. As reported elsewhere (Underwood, 1990), nearly one-third of all first
births to married couples during this pe

riod occurred within less than nine
months from date of marriage and almost 25 per cent of all births were to unwed mothers. Expectably, despite decreased amplitude of variations in
seasonal marriage patterns in the latter

part of this study period, the magnitude

of monthly variations in inferred conceptions actually increased slightly. Expectably, too, in the presumed absence

of direct influence of marital date on
higher order births, no statistically significant secular difference was found in
seasonality of ith birth order offspring to
married couples.

However, when analysis is limited to

date of wedding and of birth of first child
becomes apparent (Table 3), with more
than 50 per cent of first births occurring
within eleven months after marriage.
This corresponds well with Vincent’s
finding that 50.67 per cent of 6,552 “‘fullterm’’ first births occurred in the same
post-marital months among women
with large families (cited in Leridon
1977, p. 18). Thus, variance in fecundability, as well as high levels of premarital
conceptions, reduces the level of observed associated seasonality of marital
and-first birth events. Finally, it should
be noted that marital date actually had
an indirect influence on ith order births
through birth spacing patterns, with, for
example, 24.7 per cent of siblings in 372
two-child families and 22.3 per cent of
third children in 354 three-child families
born in months falling within 30 days of

birthmonth of firstborn offspring, values
appreciably in excess of random expected values.

While seasonality of marital and natal patterns was seemingly unaffected by
physical and biotic factors, mortality
patterns were clearly the outcome of
more complex interactions involving
these environmental features. Early observers in this period reported the presence of leprosy and yaws, noted that intestinal parasitism was ubiquitous,
infant mortality levels very high, and attributed the major causes of adult
deaths to tuberculosis and dysentery
(Safford, 1901; Cox, 1904, et seqq;
Carano and Sanchez, 1964). Attempts
by successive U.S. Navy administrations
to improve health conditions, providing
free medical services, isolating those
suffering from leprosy and yaws, train

ing midwives, and undertaking a series
of public health measures and projects
to develop adequate water supplies,
sewage disposal, and sanitary food handling and storage procedures, had limited success, and benefits were unevenly
distributed. Even in Agana, the shallow
river continued for many years to be
used for laundry, bathing, and sewage
purposes, ensuring fecal contamination
of individuals and, during heavy rains,
of shallow household wells and house
gardens. One outbreak of typhoid fever
during the rainy season in 1922 caused
eight deaths; 187 deaths resulted from a
series of episodes of bacillary dysentery
in 1923-25; and 105 cases of cholera infantum were reported in 1933 (Haddock, 1973). Thompson (1942, p. 163)
stated: ‘There is usually an epidemic (of
diarrhea and dysentery) . . . at the end of
the long dry season.”

Educational programs to improve
sanitary practices could accomplish little
in the absence of adequate indoor
plumbing or screening in most native
homes and, in any event, could not stop
the spread of transmissible diseases by
uncontrolled mosquito and fly vectors.
Infants and young children heavily infested with intestinal parasites had little
resistance to the epidemics of mumps,
measles, and pertussis which repeatedly
appeared over these years, or to less
dramatic episodes of milder gastrointestinal or respiratory illnesses, leading to
high levels of infant and early childhood
deaths, especially during the rainy season. Adults, patently the more hardy
survivors of similar exposures during
their own childhoods, were less likely to
succumb or to die so quickly from the
synergistic effects of increased parasitic
loads and other morbidities, such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, or puerperal infection. Indeed, as shown above, there

is for married adults a one-month lag behind the rise in infant/childhood deaths
associated with the onset of the rainy
season, and a dramatic rise in adult mortality does not peak until two to three
months thereafter.

Comparison of secular trends in mortality patterns for married adults, by sex
(Figs. 7 and 8), indicates a distinctive
change in the magnitude and timing of
the seasonal peak for males. A similar
comparison for infant and childhood
deaths (Figs. 9 and 10) does not reveal
any marked sex differential, suggesting
that adult males were the earlier and
greater beneficiaries of changing medical and public health conditions during
this period.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Analyses of family register data for
the native population of Guam covering
the period 1902 through 1940 reveal seasonality in all categories of vital events
examined here. In this usually benign
tropical environment, inhabited by settled farmers and fishers, climatic seasonality, for which rainfall patterns serve as
primary index, is most closely associated
with mortality patterns, with sanitation
practices and facilities of that period ensuring optimal conditions for the growth
and dissemination of intestinal parasites
and of mosquito- or fly-borne pathogens, especially during the rainy season.

In contrast, marital seasonality was
closely linked to the Catholic Church
calendar and related obligations,
marked by peaks preceding and following the Lenten period, with a secondary
trough occurring during Advent. Moderate attenuation of these peaks and
troughs can be detected during the latter
part of this period and are likely related
to increased opportunities for wage em

ployment, helping to defray the costs of
weddings and new households, and to
increasing membership in other religious groups. Today, marital seasonality for the multi-ethnic population of
modern Guam parallels that of the
mainland United States, with peaks occurring in June and December (Government of Guam, 1985).

Comparison of seasonal patterns of
births to married couples with births to
single mothers quickly dispels any reasonable possibility of a significant climatic influence on monthly distributions
of births, while high levels of premarital
sexual activity obscure the relationship
between marital and natal seasonality.
When attention is directed only to those
first births occurring more than eight
months after marriage, over 50 per cent
of inferred successful conceptions are
estimated to have taken place within the
first few months of marriage. The
broader distribution of the timing of first
births to the remaining part of fertile
married couples represents expectable
heterogeneity in fecundability, including some degree of earlier spontaneous
abortion. Elsewhere (Underwood,
n.d.) I will argue that the anomalous low
percentage of ‘‘full-term”’ births within
one year of marriage to women wed in
April represents an example of seasonal
epidemic spontaneous abortion.

Despite its seeming universality, seasonality in vital events does not proceed

from identical causes in those human
populations studied to date. It is, moreover, now evident that neither cultural
nor biometerological causes suffice, separately, to explain the universality of the
phenomenon nor the complexity underlying its variable manifestations in different populations. Indeed, the effective
environment of each human population
is a product of interactions between
these forces and, to date, comparisons
most commonly have been drawn
among populations whose effective environments, even in similar bioclimatic
regimes or the same geographic locale,
may be wholly distinct.

April was, indeed, not the cruelest
month in historical Guam, but a time to
look forward to increased numbers of
marriage fiestas and a relative dearth of
funeral occasions. It was the same
month when infant and childhood
deaths and stillbirths reached their annual nadir. It was, in many climatic and
demographic respects, the best of times.

This is a revised version of a paper presented at the 59th Annual Meeting of the
American Association of Physical Anthropologists in Miami, Florida, April, 1990. I
am deeply grateful to the staffs of the Government of Guam Vital Statistics Office. the
Micronesian Area Research Center, and to
countless Guamanians who for many years
have been of continuing assistance in the collection and interpretation of these data.
