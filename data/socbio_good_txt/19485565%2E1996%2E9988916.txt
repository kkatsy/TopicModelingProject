and Sex Ratios at Birth

I should like to make two points in
response to the note of Brewis and Underwood (1994). They report high sex
ratios at birth and evidence for high
coital rates in Micronesia. They suggest that the one is due to the other.
First, quantitative grounds will be offered for the doubt I expressed on this
conclusion (James, 1994). Second, the
effects of past sex-selective infanticide
will be raised.

CoITAL RATES AND SEX RaTIOS

The reported sex ratios at birth
in Micronesia are ‘over 108-110”
(Brewis and Underwood, 1994). The
reported sex ratio of births conceived
in the first month of marriage in Australia 1908-67 was 109 (Renkonen,
1970). Mean reported marital coital
rates in the first month of marriage in
the United States and England were
estimated at 20 per month (James,
1981, 1983). Among women who conceive, the mean coital rate of those
who conceive is greater than that of
those who do not. (Fecundability, the
probability of conceiving in a month at
risk, is partially dependent on coital
rate.) Hence, if variation of sex ratios
across societies were wholly explained
by coital rates, then Micronesian coital

rates must be substantially in excess of
20 per month throughout couples’ reproductive lives. This rate is of the order of three times the means in postindustrial societies. Until evidence of
such coital behavior in Micronesia is
forthcoming, one may wonder whether
their high sex ratios have additional
causes.

Sex RaTIo AT BIRTH AND PAST
SEX-SELECTIVE INFANTICIDE

Brewis and Underwood (1994)
wrote that sex-selective infanticide is
not a plausible explanation for the high
sex ratios in Micronesia. I assume that
they are implying that current sexselective infanticide is negligible and so
is not responsible. However, variation
in past sex-selective infanticide could
account for variation in current sex ratios at conception and birth. This result
has been shown mathematically on the
plausible assumption that there is a
genetic component to Lexis variance
across couples of p (the probability, assumed constant through a couple’s reproductive life, that they will produce a
boy at each birth) (Kumm et al., 1994).
Thus, the mean current sex ratio at
conception (and birth) of a population
depends (among other things) on (1)

the magnitude of the genetic component of the Lexis variance and (2) the
extent of sex-selective infanticide in
the past. However, even if one were
able to estimate the extent of such infanticide, there is still doubt about the
extent of the total Lexis variance, let
alone its genetic component (James,

Communications 133

1990). Whence it would seem fruitless
to discuss the causes of the differences
between mean sex ratios in different
societies. They probably are due—at
least partially—to different (but unknown) measures of sex-selective infanticide in the past.
