ABSTRACT: Consanguineous marriages have decreased significantly (p < 0.01) among the Kamma of Andhra Pradesh over the past forty years. The decline in uncle-niece marriages has
contributed heavily to the decline in consanguinity, which may be due to shifting from agriculture to other occupations like government service and the rapid growth of industrialization.
More recently, the tendency toward a lower consanguinity rate has been strengthened by
reduction in number of children per marriage which reduces the number of eligible cousins.
Marriages beyond first cousin have remained more or less constant.

The mating pattern in human populations reflects a functional aspect of
social structure and influences the gene
pool. Consanguineous marriages, a
type of assortative meeting, results in
change in gene frequencies. Quantitative data on consanguineous marriages
in India were first presented by Sanghvi et al. (1956), after which several attempts were made to present data on
inbreeding from different parts of India. The highest values were reported
from southern India, especially from
the state of Andhra Pradesh (Dronam
Raju, 1963; Rao and Inbaraj, 1977;
Veeraraju, 1978; Sanghvi, 1966; Rao,
1982; and Govinda Reddy, 1981). In
this paper, we examine the frequency
of consanguineous marriages and their
changes through time in a Mendelian
population, the Kamma of Andhra
Pradesh.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The Kamma, a forward caste whose
traditional occupation is agriculture, is

one of the dominant groups of Andhra
Pradesh in all socioeconomic factors
and belongs to Dravidian stock. They
are strictly endogamous, and widow
marriage Is not permitted among them.

The data were collected from 400
couples in 7 villages spread over three
taluks, which are now called revenue
mandals of Chittoor District, Andhra
Pradesh. For each marriage, a family
pedigree was drawn in order to determine the type of consanguinity involved. The year of marriage is noted
to determine the trend of consanguinity. The respondents include both husband and wife. Armitage’s test (1955)
was used to determine the linear trend
of consanguinity.

RESULTS

The absolute and percentage frequencies are shown in Table 1. In
all, 45.0 per cent of the Kamma were
consanguineously married. Among the
Kamma, uncle-niece marriage constituted 16.8 per cent, while first-cousin

marriage constituted 19.5 per cent.
Marriages with first-cousin-once removed, second cousin, second-cousinonce-removed and third cousin accounted for 8.7 per cent of all
marriages. Uncle-niece marriages (16.8
per cent) were more frequent than matrilateral first-cousin marriages (15.0
per cent). Matrilateral cross-cousin
marriages were 18 per cent and patrilateral cross-cousin marriages were
10.2 per cent of all such marriages.

The inbreeding coefficient (mean
and standard error) is given in Table 2.
The sex-linked inbreeding coefficient
was higher (0.0422) than the autosomal
inbreeding coefficient (0.0353).

The year of marriage of each couple
of the sample was noted to determine
the trend of consanguineous mar
riages. The sample was classified into
seven groups. Marriages prior to and
during 1956 were put into one group,
and marriages thereafter were grouped
in 5-year periods (Table 3). For the
period covering 1956 and earlier, 58.7
per cent of marriages were consanguineous; for 1957-61, 55.0 per cent;
for 1962-66, 53.7 per cent; for 196771, 50.8 per cent. Consanguineous
marriages were obviously declining.
During 1972-76, only 33.3 per cent of
marriages were consanguineous. During 1977~81, they increased to 38.5
per cent, but then fell to 30.9 per cent

Marriages more distant than those between first cousins do not contribute
much to the high frequency of consanguinity and remain more or less constant through time.

DISCUSSION

Studies reviewing the incidence of

Consanguinity in India

centuries, and it still continues to be an
important marriage type in Indian society, although its prevalence is declining. Recently, the tendency toward a
lower consanguinity rate has been
strengthened by the reduction in the
number of children per marriage,
which reduces the number of eligible
cousins. Worldwide, a decline in consanguineous marriages has also been

reported by Sterm (1960) for Europe,
Schal and Macluer (1968) and Imai
