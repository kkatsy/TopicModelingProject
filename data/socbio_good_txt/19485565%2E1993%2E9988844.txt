ABSTRACT: Mexico has a large and rapidly growing labor force. This paper projects the Mexican
national labor force from 1980 to 2005, with varying assumptions of vital rates, economic
activity, and international migration. Projections are also made for the urban and rural components of the Mexican population, assuming inter-component migration flows. Results indicate
that the Mexican labor force will grow over the projection period at an average annual rate of
907,000 to 1,183,000 workers; will age slightly; and will have a much higher proportion female.
Implications are discussed in tezms of Mexican-U.S. migration, possible agreements on free

trade, and global trends in workforce.

The Mexican population has grown
substantially in the twentieth century,
from a level of 25.8 million in 1950
(SPP, 1955) to a level of 69.7 million in
1980 (Nunez and Moreno, 1986) and to
a preliminary census estimate of 81.1
million in 1990 (Population Reference
Bureau, 1990).! Mexico’s population
growth in the 1970’s and 1980’s slowed,
as fertility rates dropped. For example,
Mexico’s Total Fertility Rate (TFR)
dropped from 6.5 in 1970 (Nunez and
Moreno, 1982) to 3.8 in 1989 (Population Reference Bureau, 1989) and toa
medium estimate of 3.4 for 1990 (Camposortega, 1989). However, since fertility decline exerts a delayed effect on
reducing population growth (Keyfitz,
1971), decline or levelling of the total
Mexican population is not expected to
occur until the second quarter of the
twenty-first century.

1This preliminary Mexican census national total
is controversial and undergoing discussions and debate (Population Reference Bureau, 1990). By comparison, earlier totals projected for 1990 included

86.7 million for 1989 (Population Reference Bureau, 1989) and 85.8 million for 1990 (SPP, 1988).

In the period 1940-80, the Mexican
national labor force increased rapidly,
at a rate roughly proportional to the
period’s rapid population growth
{Alba, 1984b). Economically active
population increased from 5.9 million
in 1940 to 22.1 million in 1980 (SPP,
1985). During this period, the Mexican
economy demonstrated the capacity to
absorb most of this massive increase in
labor supply. However, since 1980,
signs of decreasing ability to do so are
apparent. For instance, one indicator
of labor oversupply is the large number
of Mexican undocumented migrants
flowing to and residing in the United
States. In the 1980’s the latter number
was estimated in the range of 1.5-3.5
million (Levine et al., 1985; see also
Bean et al., 1983), with 100,000 to
200,000 net migrants estimated as entering the United States from Mexico
every year (Heer, 1979; Espenshade,
1990). An estimate postdating the 1988
U.S. Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) indicates a total of
1.01 million undocumented migrants

162

resident in the United States in 1989, of
which 0.83 million were born in Mexico (Woodrow, 1990). Labor oversupply is also reflected in the recent
growth of the informal labor force in
Mexico. Informal labor force is defined
as a labor force that is nonsalaried, underemployed, often temporary, and
employed at organizations that are not
legally constituted (Anderson, 1988;
DeSoto, 1989).

Economic problems are often associated with oversupply of labor, including unemployment, underemployment, and reduction in salary levels. In
the 1980’s and continuing into the
1990’s, Mexican economic problems
have been major, involving a huge national debt, currently devaluation, and
lack of competitiveness. Labor oversupply was partly overshadowed by
these other problems.

In the early 1990's, there is the serious prospect of the signing of a North
American Free Trade Agreement that
would ease restrictions of flows of
trade and labor between Canada, the
United States, and Mexico. If passed,
such a multifaceted agreement would
likely increase employment opportunities in Mexico, contributing to reduced
flows of low skilled labor from Mexico
to the United States. This would relieve some of the problems of growing
labor oversupply inside Mexico and
help improve the Mexican economy.
At the same time, migration pull factors in the United States may be enhanced by a Free Trade Agreement, in
order to relieve sectoral labor shortages in the United States.

Some of the changes anticipated for
the Mexican labor force are reflective
of trends in the global labor force, including the development of young,

increasingly educated, and mobile
workforces in developing nations parallel with the aging of the workforce in
advanced nations. This study will examine projected Mexican changes in
light of expected worldwide change
and will identify similarities and differences.

Changes in the Mexican labor force
over the past fifty years provide a backdrop for considering the present situation. From 1940 to 1960, the Mexican
economy was mostly prosperous, with
the labor force approximately doubling from 5.9 to 11.3 million persons.
This labor force increase was absorbed
about evenly between the agricultural
and nonagricultural sectors of the
economy (Alba, 1984a). Agricultural
labor demand increased due to expansion in cultivable land area and slow
growth in mechanization. During this
period, the urban proportion of the
population increased from 37 per cent
to 51 per cent, and growth in the urban
sector offered numerous new jobs that
accommodated the larger labor supply
without adverse effects.

Beginning in the mid-60’s, major
changes impacted the national labor
force situation. First, the agricultural
sector of the economy stabilized, and
from 1960 to 1980 the agricultural labor force increased by only 14 per cent
compared to a 140 per cent increase in
the nonagricultural labor force. The
overall labor force increased from 11.3
to 22.1 million persons.

Another change in recent decades
has been the substantial growth in the
informal labor force. This phenomenon is reflected in the 30 per cent of the
economically active population having
an unspecified occupation in the 1980
Census of Population (Rendon and

Vol. 40, No. 3-4

Salas, 1986). The informal labor force
is difficult to estimate, and few research studies have looked into it.
Anderson (1988) identified socioeconomic correlates of the informal labor
force in the northern border region as
measured by the following proxy variables from pooled data for the 1950-80
censuses: (1) the proportion of economically active population in the insufficiently specified category and (2)
the per cent of economically active
workers earning less than the legal
minimum wage. She ascertained several factors which predicted the extent
of the informal labor force including
rural-urban minimum wage differentials and female labor force participation.

Another change in the _ period
1940-80 has been a major rise in female economic activity, as seen in
Table 1. Female labor force participation increased dramatically over the
forty years, although it slowed during
the decade of the 1960’s. The growing
female economic activity is associated
with increased educational attainment
of the Mexican population, reduced
childbearing, and changes in family
norms regarding female work (Kasarda et al., 1986; Pick et al., 1989a,b).

Several studies have estimated the
net migration flows of labor force,
largely undocumented, from Mexico to
the United States (Heer, 1979; Espenshade, 1990; Woodrow et al., 1990).
One estimate put the annual net flow of
undocumented population at 82,000 to
232,400 for 1970-75 (Heer, 1979).
More recently, the annual flow of undocumented population from Mexico
to the U.S. was estimated at 115,000
for the 1979-86 period (Woodrow et
al., 1987). Espenshade (1990) cites an

163

annual increase of 190,000 in the early
1980’s for net Mexican undocumented
population resident in the United
States, plus an annual flow of 85,000
legal Mexican migrants. However, few
studies have examined the MexicanU.S. migration flows in terms of labor
supply, i.e., utilizing models that take
into account the internal Mexican labor supply.

One study examining labor supply
and demand for the entire Caribbean
Basin concluded that the economies of
Mexico and the Caribbean countries
would be unlikely to provide enough
jobs to keep up with labor supply (Espenshade, 1990). An implication of
this imbalance is pressure for increased
migration from Mexico to the U.S. The
Espenshade study was based on labor
force projections done in the mid 80’s
by the International Labour Office
(ILO, 1986). Garcia y Griego’s cohortcomponent multiregional projection of
Mexico’s labor force assumed two regimes of migration from Mexico to the
United States for 1990-2010: a medium one assuming annual net migration to the United States at 190,000 per
year and a “drastic change’’ regime
with annual net migration of 400,000
per year (Garcia y Griego, 1989). The
study speculated that the supply of migrants from Mexico to the United
States in the 1990’s would be determined much more by the economies
and population dynamics of the two
countries than by the consequences of
implementing IRCA (Garcia y Griego,
1989).

The Garcia y Griego study differs
greatly from the present research in its
projection methodology and assumptions. Major distinctions include the
following: (1) Garcia y Griego projects

(2) He disaggregates the projection by
three regions, one consisting of Mexican citizens resident in the United
States. By contrast, we project only for
population resident in Mexico. (3) His
assumed fertility rates are about 12-17
per cent higher than those in the
present study, since he adopted middecade rates from the Mexican census
(1985), rather than the lower revised
rates of Camposortega (1989), based

on a later survey. His study focuses on

emigration of population from Mexican regions as a source of U.S. labor
supply (without actually estimating labor force based on economic activity
rates), whereas the present study focuses on the much larger Mexican internal population and labor force.
The present study projects the Mexican labor force supply for the period
1980-2005. It has the following objectives: (1) to estimate the age-specific
Mexican labor force for 1980-2005
based on assumed regimes of fertility,
mortality, rates of economic activity,
net international migration, and Mexican, internal urban-rural migration
flows; (2) to project similarly the urban and rural labor force components;

tions and average age of total, urban,

changes in sex composition of the labor
force, under varying assumptions; (5)
to analyze the consequences of changes
in the age structure of the labor force,
including making comparisons relative
to the United States; and (6) to discuss
implications of the findings in terms of
the two nations’ economies and international migration policies, Mexico’s
population control policy, prospects
for a North American Free Trade
Agreement, and trends in the global
workforce. The present research expands existing literature by estimating
the components of projected Mexican
labor force—in particular, age, sex,
and urban/rural components—and by
analyzing binational and global implications of changes forecast in components.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The labor force projections are
based on standard methodology which
first performs a _ cohort-component
population projection and then multiplies by age-specific economic activity
rates (Shryock and Siegel, 1976). The
population projections are made utilizing mortality rates, which are assumed
to decrease for the projection period,

and Low, Medium, and High regimes
of declining fertility rates. Projections
are done for the entire nation, as well
as for the urban and rural segments.
Urban and rural projections incorporate fertility rates, which are assumed
to differ between urban and rural population segments, and age-specific
rural-to-urban and urban-to-rural migration flows, which are postulated to
vary over the projection period.

A Medium and a High regime of
age-, sex-specific economic activity
rates are assumed, both of which
change over the projection period.
Economic activity rates are postulated
not to vary between the urban and rural segments of the population.

Also incorporated in the projection
mode are two regimes of net international migration. Low Regime allows
for a fixed volume of net international
emigration from Mexico of 100,000 per
year. In accord with historical trends,
nearly all of this flow is to the United
States. The 100,000 figure corresponds
to the 82,000 lower bound of estimated
annual net emigration flow from Mexico to the United States of undocumented migrants (Heer, 1979). It approximates half of the 225,000 volume
of annual net emigrants assumed by recent official Mexican census projections (SPP, 1988).

The High Regime of international
migration assumes a linear increase
from 115,000 annual net emigrants in
1980-84 to 175,000 in 1990-94 and to
235,000 in 2000-04. From 1990 onwards, the High Regime approximates
the Mexican census’s figure of 225,000,
but is less than Espenshade’s estimate
of 275,000 for the early 1980's. It
should be noted that, for the 1980's,
the High Regime is less than Heer’s up

per value of 232,000 for 1970-75. By
comparison, the present Low and High
migration regimes have levels of emigration about half those postulated by
Garcia y Griego (1989). However, his
high regime (termed “drastic change’’)
is intended to explore the maximum
possible upper bounds, whereas the
present high regime is intended to be
more within the bounds of existing literature and government estimates.
The set of projection regimes ‘for
Total Population is summarized in Table 2. The Urban set of projection regimes is analogous to that for Total
Population, and is labelled U1Ma,
UI1Mb, . .. U2Hc. Likewise, the Rural set is similar and labelled R1Ma,
R1Mb, ... R2Hc. Overall, there are
three sets of twelve projection regimes
for a total of 36 projections. The projection software was written in FORTRAN and based partly on modified
standard FORTRAN life table and
population projection routines (Keyfitz and Flieger, 1971). An updated
PYRAMID computer graphics program was used to examine age structures (Pick, 1974). :

AND LABOR FORCE VALUES

(1) Initial Population.—The initial
1980 Mexican population is that utilized by INEGI for its 1980 population
projections, which is adjusted for undercount (SPP, 1983). The total population was 69.7 million, which reflects
a 2.9 million upward adjustment from
the 66.8 million unadjusted Mexican
population count appearing in the 1980
census (SPP, 1982-5). The initial rural

Final reports of the 1990 Mexican Census are
not expected to be available until 1993.

and urban age structures are those estimated by Nunez and Moreno (1986).

(2) Vital Rates. Mortality. —The initial 1980 age-specific mortality data utilized are the official Mexican vital statistics adjusted for misreporting by
CELADE (1989). ‘The life expectancies assumed for 1980 are 63.3 for
males and 69.3 for females. These values are very close to alternative 1980
life expectancies calculated by Nunez
and Moreno (1986) at 64.1 for males
and 68.0 for females. Corresponding to
CELADBP’s estimates, the present projection postulates that life expectancies
will increase linearly over the 25-year
period by a total of 6.5 years for males
and 7.1 years for females. These incre
ments are very similar to Nunez and
Moreno’s assumed 25-year increases of
6.0 years for males and 5.7 years for
females.

(3) Vital Rates. Fertility. —The total
fertility was determined based on recent revised estimates of Total Fertility
Rates for the period 1980 by Camposortega (1989) and Arriaga (1989)
and are shown in Table 3. The 1980
age-specific fertility rates were calculated by interpolation, based on the urban and rural age-specific rates for
1975-80 and 1980-85 (Nunez and
Moreno, 1986). These rates are forecast to decrease over the 25-year projection period. They are weighted by a
constant, so that they exactly corre

spond, when aggregated by age, to the
Camposortega (1989) estimates of Total Fertility Rates for total, urban, and
rural sectors in Table 3.

(4) Economic Activity Rates.—
Initial economic activity rates were
based on data by age and sex, from the
Mexican census of 1980 as reported by
the International Labour Office (ILO,
1988). These rates were projected to
the year 2005 based on two regimes,
Medium and High. The Medium regime assumes linear extrapolation of
Mexican historical changes, 1950 to
1980, in the male and female agespecific rates. As seen in the Medium
Regime assumptions of male economic activity rates shown in Figures 1

Mexican Labor Force

 

167

and 2, male rates are hypothesized to
remain constant for ages 25-54 and to
decline moderately at the younger and
older ages, in accord with the Mexican historical patterns shown in Figure 1. These decreases are ascribed to
continuing educational advances at
younger ages and increased retirement
at older ages. The projected High Regime rates for males assumes the same
constancy of male rates for ages 24-54,
while assuming decreases at lower than
historical rates for the younger and
older ages (see Figure 3).

Female economic activity rate patterns do not resemble those for males,
leading to a different pattern of future
rates, as seen in Figures 4, 5, and 6.
Historically in the 1950-80 period,
Mexican female economic activity increased relatively more in the prime
working ages and less for children and
the elderly, compared to males (compare Figure 4 with Figure 1). Similar to
the male case, in the Medium Regime
assumptions for female economic activity, the historical pace of change in
the rates is linearly extrapolated (Figure 5). As seen in Figure 6, the High
Regime for women postulates that
rates increase over the 25-year period
in the prime working ages 25-54 about
twice as much as for the Medium Regime. The High Regime assumptions
lead to an overall 25-year increase in
female economic activity of about 100
per cent. For late teen (16-19) and retirement (65+) age groups, no change
is postulated, which differs from the
small historical increase for these age
groups. For the late teen-age group, it

by growing educational opportunities.
For the oldest age groups, it is assumed

so than is postulated for Mexico 1980

retirement benefits led to a very sharp
decline in economic activity rates at retirement age, much more than is hypothesized 1980-2005 for Mexico, a
nation which almost certainly cannot
afford such social welfare benefits. For
women, the comparison of the Mexican 1980~2005 projected High Regime

ages 25-64 commenced at about the
same level. Over the period, however,
Mexican rates are assumed to grow
about 50 per cent more than for the
United States historically. This assumption is partially attributable to the
expected increase in the maquiladora
and tourism industries, which rely
heavily upon female labor. The potential impact of a Free Trade Agreement
remains unknown. For retirement ages

(65+), rates for both nations remain
constant, while rates for age group
20-24 show a similar increase for both
countries. For the late teens (age 1619), the rates cannot be compared,
since the U.S. data for 1930 and 1940
are subject to unusual definitions
(Bogue, 1985). In summary, key transitional features of steadiness in male
rates and sharp rise in female rates are
similar between the historical U.S.

than the ratio for the male labor force.
The faster growth in female labor force
is the direct result of assumed rapidly

versus steady rates for males.

The sex ratio of the initial labor
force in 1980 undergoes lowering, for

the Mexican labor force in 1980 was

the workforce were men. By the year
2005, the projected sex ratio of the labor force falls to about 197 for the medium economic activity rate regime,
while it falls to about 159 for the high
economic activity rate series. The latter case points to males’ comprising
only 60 per cent of the workforce. This

labor force has many implications in
areas aS diverse as fertility, occupational and salary differentials, industrial psychology, day care, education,
and household economics. It also has
substantial implications for the family
structure, relationships within the family, and potentially even an increase in
divorce rates.

The projections imply that roughly
one million net workers will be added
to the Mexican labor force each projection year. As seen in Table 5, the
net annual increment will vary by regime from 907,000 to 1.2 million. This
large and continuing absolute growth
in employable labor force will place

great strains on the Mexican economy,
including potentially large unemployment and underemployment, and will
add to the pressure for labor migration
to the United States.

The net additions to the labor force
will be more heavily female than the
initial workforce. For example, under:
the Medium Economic Activity regimes, the sex ratio of the average net
increment is about 152, whereas under the High Economic Activity Rate
regimes, it is about 111. In the latter
case, females will be added to the national labor force at a volume approximating that of males. Regardless of
regime, the implication is that the
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

176 Pick et al.

Mexican job market will need to
accommodate female workers in unprecedented numbers.

AGE STRUCTURAL EFFECTS

The projections imply large shifts in
the age structure of the population and
the labor force. Generally, there is an
aging of the population and workforce,
and an increasing feminization of the
workforce. Examples of age structural
effects of the projections are displayed
in Figures 7 and 8. The age structural
results discussed for these two figures
also apply to the other regimes, for
which figures are not shown due to
space constraints. As seen in Figure
7, the total population age pyramid
shifts from triangular-shaped in 1980
to diamond-shaped in 2005, with the
greatest width for the 30-34 age group.
There is an absolute decrease for children under 15, and a very large increase in the prime labor force ages of
20-59. Overall, there is radical transformation in age distribution, with an
emphasis on “economically active”
over “‘dependent” age groups.

For the medium economic activity
regime shown in Figure 8, the labor
force age structural change is greater
for women than men. For instance, the
female age groups 30-59 undergo especially rapid growth, tripling or quadrupling in absolute size over the projection period. However, it is also
apparent that the absolute effects on
the male working age groups are very
large. For both sexes, age distributional effects are least under age 20 and
in the retirement ages. Overall, there
are remarkable increases of women as
opposed to men in the labor force.

PROJECTION OF RURAL AND URBAN
POPULATION

Projections were also carried out for
rural and urban population components to assess differential rural and
urban labor force impacts. Urban and
rural segments in the projections were
accomplished for the following reasons: (1) In Mexico there have been
important differences in vital rates between the urban and rural segments
of the population. These differences
are especially important for fertility,
where rates are assumed to be more
than 60 per cent higher in rural versus
urban areas (see Table 3). Disaggregation also allows differences to be incorporated between rural and urban mortality rates. (2) Differences in labor
force supply pressures in rural versus
urban areas are important to ascertain
for policy makers, since the demand
side of the job market is quite different
in rural and urban areas.

The projection methodology utilized was the same as applied for the
total population, except that, at each
five-year projection iteration, an age
vector of postulated numbers of net
rural/urban migrants was added to, or
subtracted from, projected urban and
rural populations. The specific assumptions of the rural/urban projections are
as follows.

(1) Mortality. — As in the case of aggregated population, mortality is assumed to decline steadily during the
projection. Mortality rates are assumed to be higher in rural than in urban areas. Based on estimates of
Nunez and Moreno (1986), the difference between urban and rural life expectancies is assumed to be constant

for the 25 years, equalling 3.8 years for
males and 3.1 years for females. At
each five-year projection interval, agespecific mortality rates for urban and
rural sectors are interpolated from the
age-specific mortality rates of the full
population by an iterative procedure.’

(2) Fertility.—The projections assume differential fertility levels for the
rural and urban population, in accord
with estimates of Arriaga (1989). The
low, medium, and high fertility assumptions, classified by rural and urban, were presented in Table 3.

(3) Rural/urban Migration. —Rural/
urban migration is included in the projection by assuming absolute numbers
of age-specific gross migrants, 1.e.,
urban-to-rural and rural-to-urban, for
each five-year projection interval. The
postulated gross migration flows are
based on a prior study that projected
urban/rural migration (Nunez and
Moreno, 1986). Migration flows are
based on the assumption that the number of age-specific rural-to-urban migrants starts at a total level of 5.5 million per five-year interval and increases
slowly and at a decreasing rate over the

7The steps in this iterative procedure are as follows. The mortality rates for a given projection year
are initially assumed to equal those for the Total
Population Regime. An algorithm then linearly increases (decreases) all the age-specific Urban (or
Rural) mortality rates by adding (subtracting) a factor equal to the difference between the postulated
Urban (or Rural) life expectancy and the Population
life expectancy, assumed for that projection interval, divided by the postulated Total Population life
expectancy. The procedure is repeated, substituting
the latest adjusted rates, until convergence is
reached. In all cases in the present study, the mortality rates converged. The procedure results in an
Urban or Rural mortality rate age vector, which is
a constant multiple of the similar vector for Total
Population. Given the slight changes made, i.e. to
adjust for life expectancy differences of about 2-3
years, this procedure is considered appropriate.
However, it may not be appropriate for adjustments
of very large differences in life expectancies.

duration of the projection period. The
number of urban-to-rural migrants is
assumed to start at a level of 4.0 million
per five years and to decrease slowly
over the projection period. The projections assume a continuation of the
long-time historical trend of positive
net rural-to-urban migration over the
course of the projections (Unikel,
1977). Unikel estimated that net ruralto-urban migration contributed 2.7
million to the urban population in the
1960’s. The number of rural-to-urban
migrants per decade in the present projections somewhat exceeds the decennial total for the 1960’s. Thus, there is
a slowing in the total rural-to-urban
migration flow, which is appropriate.
Since the Mexican population was 71
per cent urban in 1980, there is limited
potential for remaining urbanization,
implying that urban growth must slow,
in the future, relative to the 1940-80
urban growth period. A major constraint to further urbanization in Mexico is the increasingly grave environmental pollution in urban areas (see
Schteingart, 1988, for the Mexico City
situation and Sanchez, 1990, for the situation in the highly urbanized border
region). Also, retention of population
in the rural areas is important for agricultural food production to supply an
enlarged national population. Potential cultivable land may be increased in
the future, further encouraging retention of rural population.

The results of projecting the rural
and urban labor force components are
seen in Table 6. When urban and rural
are combined together, the totals approximate the totals for the aggregated
labor force projection (i.e., compare
Tables 4 and 6). This result is expected,
since the mortality rates assumed are

identical, and the postulated fertility
rates in the overall projection are equal
to the average of thosé postulated for
rural and urban projections. The rural
and urban projections result in a 68 per
cent urban labor force in the year 2005,
which is similar to the initial 71 per cent
urban labor force in 1980. The steadiness in per cent urban is explained by
the offsetting influences of positive net
migration flow from rural to urban areas and higher rural versus urban fertility.

The projected number of urban economically active population in year
2005 ranges from 32 million to 37 million, which compares to a fotal labor
force in 1980 of 22 million. The projected rural economically active population in the year 2005 ranges between
14 and 17 million. As in the case of Total Population projections, the sex ratio of the labor force is higher for the
medium economic activity regime
compared to the high economic activity
regime. The explanation is simply that
the high economic activity regime emphasizes a more sizeable increase in female economic activity rates and hence
in the magnitude of the female workforce. Also, the female labor force
component increases relatively more
for the rural than for urban projections. This result reflects the synergistic
effect of higher rural fertility and
higher initial labor force sex ratio in the
rural sector.

The average annual increases in the
labor force, by rural and urban sectors,
are shown in Table 7. It is clear that the
high fertility assumptions lead to a
greater increase in the female component of the labor force, that is, relatively more young female workers will
be entering the labor force toward the

Pick et al.

end of the projection period, under the
high fertility assumptions.

In evaluating changes in age structure, we find the rural labor force has
substantial change, especially for females but also for males, and especially
in the age groups 20-39. This change is
the result of higher rural fertility, combined with increasing female labor
force participation. It should be noted
that some of the age structural effects
are the result of assumed rural-tourban net migration flows.

DISCUSSION

Labor force projections for Mexico
imply that the national labor force
grew substantially in the 1980’s and will
undergo a huge increase over the next
fifteen years. This increase is due to
several fundamental factors. The first
is an initial age structure in 1980 that is
very heavily weighted toward the
younger ages. In fact, 15 per cent of the
1980 Mexican population was under
ten years of age. As these populous
young cohorts of 1980 enter the labor
force ages, they will contribute a major
increment to the labor force. Coupled
with this fertility-based cause is a second fundamental factor, the substantial increase in female labor force participation rates postulated over the 25year period. This phenomenon is equal
or perhaps larger in magnitude than
the first effect. Together, they are
likely to bring about such a large labor
force that the Mexican » economy,
weakened substantially in the 1980s,
will have a difficult challenge providing
enough jobs to accommodate new
workers. Indeed, it may be unable to
do so, unless the Mexican economy
strengthens greatly and/or trade and

investment programs grow substantially with the United States and/or
other developed nations.

Under current projection assumptions, the impact of differential fertility
rates for 1980-2005 is overshadowed
by the impact of differential economic
activity rates. The reason is that fertility differentials will take 15 to 20 years
to have an effect, since the newly born
must grow up to working age. In Mexico, another trend in the twentieth century has been very substantial educational advance (Pick et al., 1989). As

an offshoot of expected continuing educational progress, it is likely that the
age of entry into the economically active population will increase, since
added school demands will compete
with job entry. Hence, it is only toward
the end of the 25-year projection period that variation in fertility assumptions will have any influence.

Thus, high and low economic activity regimes exert a larger influence
than do fertility regimes on the size and
sex composition of the Mexican national labor force. In these projections,

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

184

the relative range between high and
low regimes of economic activity is 11
per cent, as compared to a relative
range between high and low fertility regimes of 4 per cent. Yet, the forecasts
of future economic activity rates are
perhaps riskier to make than those for
fertility rates. One policy implication is
that the Mexican government should
continually monitor economic activity
changes over the next 15 years, not
only through the decennial census, but
also by special, more frequent surveys.
Another important dimension of
change in the projected labor force is a
slight aging. In particular, the proportion of the labor force under age 35 is
projected to lower than 59 per cent in
1980 to 51-54 per cent in the year 2005.
This modest aging preserves the relative youth of the Mexican labor force,
both on a worldwide basis and even
more so compared to the United
States. The U.S. labor force is forecast
to have only 38 per cent of workers under age 35 in 2005 (Johnston, 1991).
The youthfulness of Mexico’s workforce, versus its U.S. counterpart, has
important ramifications. First, a young
Mexican workforce should be more
geographically mobile. The observation is based on a variety of migration
studies, which point to young adulthood as a positive migratory factor
(CEED, 1970; Bowles et al., 1975;
Bogue, 1985). A second implication is
that the youthfulness of legal Mexican
migrant workers in the United States
will lead to lowering of the salary
and benefit burden on U.S. employer
firms. As a result, American businesses
will be more favorably inclined toward
easing migration barriers. Within Mexico, the workforce’s youthfulness, coupled with its anticipated rising edu
Pick et al.

 

Social Biology

cational level, will encourage a very
strong and competitive workforce,
compared to other developing nations
(see Johnston, 1991).

The effect of the projected massive
increase in the Mexican national labor
force has implications for the United
States and for other nations in North
America, including Canada. First, the
Mexican economy in its current weakened state is unlikely to be able to absorb the very large projected labor
force. Therefore, it is likely that migratory pressure will increase from
Mexico to the United States, regardless of the immigration legalities and
government policies in effect, including free trade initiatives. This pressure
is heightened by relatively small
projected increases in the U.S. labor
force. For example, one projection of
the U.S. labor force indicates it will
grow from 106 million in 1980 to a level
of 138 million in 2005, increasing by
32 million (Bogue, 1985; see also
Johnston, 1991). This figure compares
to growth in the Mexican labor force,
1980-2005, of 23-26 million under the
medium economic activity regime and
28-31 million under the high economic
activity regime. Hence, the Mexican
national labor force is likely to increase
from 1980 to 2005 by roughly the same
amount as the U.S. national labor
force. It is important to note also that
the U.S. workers added over the period will be substantially more educated and skilled than their Mexican counterparts. Thus, pressures will
grow in the lower-skilled segments of
the U.S. labor markets to tap the large
volume of unskilled Mexican laborers.

The Mexican economy, although in
disarray for part of the 1980's, is starting to recover in the 1990’s under the

new economic policies of the Salinas.

administration. Under improved conditions, Mexico’s economy may demonstrate increased labor demand,
which can absorb some of the increased labor supply.

Espenshade (1989) -projected the
following demand levels for Mexican
labor in 2005: 36.5 million under low
job growth assumptions, 40.7 million
under medium job growth assumptions, and 60.5 million under high job
growth assumptions. The present projected labor force supply of 45-53 million substantially exceeds the low and
medium demand forecasts, but falls below the high demand forecast. Hence,
based on Espenshade’s estimates, under the most likely circumstances, the
Mexican economy will be unable to absorb the anticipated huge increase in
economically active persons.

It is possible that the U.S. government will not ease, but will even
tighten migration policies. Without an
international outlet, the large labor
oversupply inside Mexico will lead to
rising unemployment and underemployment, including increases in the
informal labor force. This outcome
would inevitably lead to a lowering in
the national standard of living (Rendon and Salas, 1987) and possibly social and political unrest.

The North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA), being considered by the United States, Mexico,
and Canada is an important but unpredictable political factor which could affect the bases of the labor force projections (Grayson, 1991; Ellard, 1991).
NAFTA was initiated by Presidents
Salinas de Gotari and Bush, starting in
mid-1990, and has garnered substantial
legislative and popular support on both

Mexican Labor Force

185

sides of the border, while also raising
opposition, especially from organized
labor, agricultural and environmental
interests, as well as from potentially
impacted business sectors, such as textiles (Butler and Pick, 1991). At this
writing, the final decision has not yet
been made on NAFTA, although even
if the present treaty fails, another attempt at a free-trade agreement may
be in the offing. The potential impact
of NAFTA for the current study is that
it would lift economic barriers to investment and trade for the United
States, Mexico, and Canada, which, in
turn, could lead to changes in industrial development and labor migration
across the border in both directions
(Ellard, 1991). Also, the NAFTA presumably would affect patterns of internal migration, especially in Mexico.
The potential effects of NAFTA on
the present labor force projections include: (1) changes in rates of net U.S.Mexico international migration, (2) alterations in economic activity rates in
Mexico, and (3) differential effects on
the age-sex distribution of international migrants and of economically active population. The effect on international migration would depend, among
other things, on the extent and location
of U.S. business investment in Mexico.
Sizeable U.S. industrial investment in
Mexico might occur, in the expectation
of cheap labor and fewer pollution and
other regulations. Such a situation
would be likely to reduce Mexican migration flows to the United States since
more jobs would be created in Mexico.
On the other hand, there might be
small reverse flows of U.S. managerial
and technical workers to Mexico. International migration rates might be
expected to equal or exceed those in

186

the High Regime. If there were substantial U.S. investment in industries
in Mexico, economic activity rates
would likely increase somewhat. However, other determinants of economic
activity, including education, welfare
benefits, and social norms for retirement, might not be affected. Finally,
effects on the age-sex distributions of
international migration and economic
activity would likely be influenced by
changes in the type of jobs available to
future Mexican migrants to the United
States, as well as by the extent of new
jobs created by U.S. industry in Mexico. These effects are tied to patterns
of industrial development and associated educational/skills requirements in
hiring.

In summary, the possible passage of
NAFTA or another free-trade agreement is a very important but complex
factor affecting Mexican labor force
projections. Potential effects depend
on what form such legislation takes,
what capital investments are made in
Mexico, which industries are most affected, and the time pattern of the unfolding of the agreement.

In many aspects, the prospective
Mexican and binational labor problems mirror those of the global labor
force in the 1990’s. It is important to
examine how typical is the Mexican—
U.S. situation compared to the world
situation and to determine the extent
of differences.

There are strong similarities between the local and global situations
in the relative volumes of workforce
growth, the potential of increased
work participation of women and
greater youthfulness of workforces in
the developing world, and strong pressures for international labor migration.

Pick et al.

 

Social Biology

A recent projection indicates that, between 1985 and 2000, the global workforce will increase by 588 million (27
per cent), but that nearly all of the increase (542 million) will be in developing nations (Johnston, 1991). Although women comprise about onethird of the present global workforce,
female labor force participation is
much higher in developed nations than
in developing ones (59 per cent versus 49 per cent in the late 80’s; see
Johnston, 1991). This gap implies that
developing nations have a large capacity for increases in female participation
rates, i.e., that the labor force in the
developing world will receive an added
boost from the closing of the gender
gap.

The advanced world in the mid 80’s
had a much older work force than the
developing world. Forty seven per cent
of the advanced nations’ workforce
was under 34 years of age in 1985 versus 61 per cent for developing nations.
In global workforce projections, the
absolute percentage difference is forecast to remain constant at 16 per cent
during the 1990’s (Johnston, 1991).
Hence, the developing world is characterized by a younger, more energetic
workforce. For the world, there appears to be increasing pressures for migration from developing to advanced
nations, due to the comparatively
greater size and youth and the increasing educational levels of the workforce
in the developing, compared to the developed, world (Johnston, 1991).

The Mexican-U.S. situation largely
parallels the global situation. However, in several aspects, the local situation differs, with the differences tending to increase the labor force pressures
between the two countries. First, for

Vol. 40, No. 3-4

the world as a whole, there are substantial transportation barriers between developing and advanced nations, although modern transport
somewhat moderates this problem.
However, for Mexico and the United
States there is little transport barrier.
Second, the gender gap in female labor
force participation is much greater between the United States and Mexico
than between the developed and developing nations as a whole. Specifically,
in 1986, the difference between the
United States and Mexico in gender
gap in labor force participation was 35
per cent versus 10 per cent for the
world as a whole. This figure implies
that Mexican and U.S. workforce
growth rates will diverge more than
global rates between developing and
advanced nations. This divergence will
tend to accentuate the pressure for international migration. In addition, the
Mexican labor force is considerably
more educated than that of the devel
oping world as a whole. For instance,

in 1986, 7 per cent of the college-age
population were in college in developing nations, while the figure for Mexico
was 16 per cent. Another indicator is
that Mexico produced the world’s sixth
largest number of engineering graduates (UN, 1988). This relatively high
and increasing educational level of
Mexican workers is another positive
factor, both for movement of Mexican
workers to the United States and establishment of U.S. industrial plants in
Mexico.

CONCLUSIONS

This paper projected the Mexican
national labor force from 1980 to 2005
under varying scenarios consisting of

Mexican Labor Force

187

three regimes of fertility, two regimes
of economic activity, and two regimes
of international migration. Mortality
rates were assumed to decline gradually over the 25 years. In addition, separate urban and rural projections were
performed. The major results of the
paper are as follows.

1. The Mexican national labor force
is expected to increase substantially
over the 25-year period, at least doubling. The labor force will increase
from 1990 to 2005 in the range of 41 to
58 per cent.

2. Annual increases in the Mexican
labor force will be substantial, averaging about one million new economically active individuals per year.

3. A critical component in the resulting labor force size and composition is female economic activity rates.
If these rates follow historical rates of
increase, it is likely that in 2005, the
national labor force will be about 40
per cent female and will include about
16-20 million economically active
women—not much less than the total
size of the Mexican labor force in 1980.
The increasing work role for women in
Mexico will change the role of women
in society and is likely to contribute to
empowering women as a greater political force.

4. The Mexican labor force will age
slightly over the projection period.
However, it will still be a young labor
force in 2005 by worldwide standards,
with about half of workers under age
35.

5. Rural and urban projections indicate that the rural and urban labor
force proportions will be maintained at
about current levels. However, labor
force pressures are likely to be greater
on the rural labor markets, as they

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

188

have lower potential for job growth.
The rural pressures will likely be
greater for females than for males, implying the likelihood of higher rural-tourban migration rates for females.

6. A free trade agreement between
Mexico and the United States would
influence many aspects of labor force
growth in Mexico—including international migration and rates of economic
activity—and the job market in both
nations. The complex effects would be
a function of the exact form of the
agreement, resultant industrial development and investment patterns, and
the timing of free trade events.

7. The structure of Mexican-U.S.
labor forces and interaction in many
ways will mirror worldwide patterns of
lowering of trade barriers and international migration barriers and increase
in labor flows across national borders.
The logical match between developing
nations’ younger, larger, increasingly
educated workforces and developed
nations’ growing labor needs applies
also to Mexico and the United States.
In the U.S.-Mexico case, this match is
accentuated further by high wage rates
and educational opportunities in the
United States, relatively high educational levels in Mexico, and large starting differences between the two nations’ gender gaps in economic activity.

8. The present study points to a
growing labor problem in Mexico that

Pick et al.

 

Social Biology

will potentially affect the nation’s standard of living, the career satisfactions
and successes of its workers, and relations with neighboring countries, especially the United States. The outcome
within Mexico can be influenced by
Mexican government policy. The government would benefit by stepped-up
surveying of labor force trends. Government policy has started to recognize
the problem with the Salinas administration free trade initiatives, but many
more policy initiatives are needed. In
the United States, both the Bush and
Clinton administrations have recognized the importance of the growing
Mexican labor force. The U.S. government, however, needs to continue to
address these problems, whether or
not a free trade agreement passes, because the pressures being created need
resolutions that will be beneficial to
both nations through pro-active and
enlightened policies.
