"GABSTRACT: Parent-child and spouse correlations were studied in a sample of 935 Jerusalem Jew
Yish families consisting of 935 children aged 17-18 years and their parents. Systolic blood presAsure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were adjusted by regression for sex, age, weight,
ooheight, and seasonality. Mother-child correlations for SBP (0.16) and DBP (0.15) were higher
© than those of father-child (SBP = 0.13; DBP = 0.09). Mid parent-child correlations were
$0.20 for SBP and 0.14 for DBP. All parent-child correlations were statistically significant. A test
“for heterogeneity of parent-child correlations among the four ethnic origin groups (Europe/
America; Asia; North Africa; Israel), was not significant. Parent-child correlations for SBP and
= DBP were highest in the European and Asian groups, lowest in the North Africans, and interSmediate in the Israeli group. Spouse correlations both for SBP and DBP were statistically not
‘= different from zero. There was no significant ethnic heterogeneity. Familial aggregation of BP
= was further assessed within subgroups of families according to a measure of religiosity of the
< head of the family. The spouse correlation for SBP differed significantly (P < 0.05) according to
Olevel of religiosity. The highest spouse correlation (0.23) was observed if the husband had five or
more years of religious education, compared with correlations of 0.01 and —0.06 for 1-4 and
“zero years of religious education respectively. Spouse correlation for DBP as well as mid parent.2 child correlations showed a similar trend although less marked. The significantly higher spouse
5 correlation in the religious group may be due to assortative mating, shared environmental fac> tors (e.g. diet, smoking, exercise), shared psychosocial attributes, or a combination of these
< explanations. This finding requires confirmation and more detailed investigation.

The central role of blood pressure

aggregation. Studies which compare
correlation coefficients of blood pressure among first degree relatives with

Kark et al., 1982) and elsewhere (Tyroler, 1980) has motivated study of the determinants of population blood pressure
levels. Familial aggregation of blood
pressure defined as the occurrence of
greater similarity among relatives than
among unrelated people has been frequently demonstrated (Havlik et al.,
1979; Johnson et al., 1979; Hayes et al.,
1971; Tyroler, 1977). Heredity, as well
as common household environment,
play a role in determining this familial

those who share the common family environment but are not genetically related may provide insight into the determinants of this association.

The Jerusalem Lipid Research Clinic
(LRC) study provided an opportunity to
examine family aggregation of blood
pressure in a large sample of Jerusalem
families. The adult Jewish population of
Jerusalem is heterogeneous; most immigrated from numerous countries over
the past 35 years. Previous studies in Is

rael have shown that, despite marked
differences among the origin groups
with regard to genetic characteristics,
culture, and lifestyle, no overt ethnic
differences in blood pressure were observed among adults (Sive, et al., 1971).

Other than a study of familial aggregation of BP in a highly inbred Arab
Population in Israel (Hurwich et al.,
1982) and a study in seven-year-old siblings in Jerusalem (Palti et al., 1982), we
are unaware of studies of the familial aggregation of BP in Israel. The objective
of the present study was to assess the familial aggregation of blood pressure in
the Jewish population of Jerusalem according to country of origin and degree
of religiosity. For some origin groups,
migration entailed integration into a
new, Western-oriented society with
changes in culture patterns reflected in
diet and other health-relevant behaviors
and in the quality of family relationships
and traditional social functions. There
are striking differences in religious observance among the Jewish population
of the city accompanied by differences
in social functioning and lifestyle.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The Jerusalem LRC population from
which the data were obtained has been
previously described (Slater et al.,
1982). Briefly, 8,646 youngsters aged 17
were screened upon reporting for their
medical examination prior to military
service. At this initial study examination
(Visit I), basic demographic information was obtained as well as data on the
current use of drugs and oral contraceptive agents. A fasting blood sample was
taken for determination of plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels
(Halfon et al., 1980). No blood pressure

Social Biology

measurements were taken at the initial
examination (Visit I) of the youngsters.

Subjects with lipid values above a
certain age-specific level were invited
for a second examination (Visit Il) as
was a 20 per cent random sample of all
participants. Seventy-five per cent of elligible youngsters attended Visit II. A
comparison of characteristics of those
attending Visit II with nonattenders
showed homogeneity of origin groups,
level of education, and measurements of
weight and height (Slater et al., 1982).
At the Visit II examination, anthropometric measurements were made and
blood pressure and pulse rate were measured. Blood pressure was measured on
the right arm four times, after the participant had been sitting quietly for five
minutes, twice by ordinary mercury
sphygmomanometer and twice with a
zero muddler according to the standard
protocol used by the Lipid Research
Clinics Program (1974). Systolic (SBP)
and fifth phase diastolic (DBP) readings
were taken. Lipids and liproproteins as
well as other biochemical values were
determined.

The parents of an approximately 60
per cent random sample from the Visit I
youngster participants were invited for
examinations (Slater et al., 1982). In all,
6,952 parents, or 72 per cent of those invited, participated. Demographic data,
blood pressure, and anthropometric
measurements as well as lipid determinations are available for 3,267 fathers
and 3,685 mothers. A single blood pressure measurement was taken at this
visit, after the participant had rested five
minutes, on the right arm in the sitting
position using an ordinary mercury
sphygmomanometer. The present analysis is based on this reading in adults
(Visit I) and for reasons of comparability, on the first measurement in young

sters, using the ordinary mercury instrument of Visit II.

Analysis was also undertaken using
the mean values of multiple readings in
the youngsters to examine whether the
familial correlations would be affected.
Use of more than a single reading may
reduce intraindividual variance and thus
enhance correlations. The current analysis is confined to families consisting of

nat least one parent who was examined at

= Visit I and one child who participated in

“the Visit Il examinations. Data from a

S total of 935 families were analyzed, 653

9 of which were nuclear families consist
Aing of both parents and one offspring

cc and 282 families with one parent only.

S Over 80 per cent of the examined

co youngsters were born in Israel. Their

parents immigrated from many counr=tries which were grouped as follows:

a) Both parents were born in Europe or
in countries of emigration from Europe.

b) Both parents were born in Asia.

c) Both parents were born in North Africa.

d) Both parents were born in Israel or
each parent in a different continent.

For families in which one of the parents was born in Israel, we used the
2 country of origin of the grandparents in
6 order to obtain a more refined classifica5 tion of the family’s origin. Groups a, b,
4 and c tend to be more ethnically homogeneous while Group d tends to heterogeneity. Our operational definition of
the degree of religiosity of the family
was the number of years of religious education (Yeshiva) received -by the head
of ‘he family in addition to his formal
schooling. No other information on religious observance was available. This
measure was not validated against other
measures of religious observance and
practice, but does have high face valid
ity.

Blood Pressure 77

Analyses were performed on unadjusted and adjusted blood pressure values. Variables included in analysis in addition to sex, age, origin, and years of
religious education were height, weight,
and an index of body mass (weight/
height), social class (based on the occupation of the head of the family) (Slater
et al., 1982), and seasonality (defined as
the number of months elapsed from the
first month of the year to the month of
the examination on a scale ranging from
Oto2 w and introduced into the analyses
as sine and cosine terms).

DESCRIPTION OF THE SAMPLE

Table 1 presents data on age, weight,
height, body mass index, and blood
pressure as measured in our families.
Analysis of variance indicated that fathers had significantly higher blood
pressure than the mothers. Statistical
testing of the variances in Table 1
showed no significant heterogeneity
among parents except for Quetelet index. Boys had significantly higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) than girls.
Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) did not
differ significantly between boys and
girls. Boys had significantly greater variance than girls for weight, Quetelet’s index, and SBP.

ADJUSTMENTS AND TRANSFORMATIONS

Blood pressure levels were adjusted
for known determinants. We used the
multiple linear regression of blood pressure on sex, age, weight, height, and the
terms modelling seasonality separately
for parents and children. Regressions
were performed first by fitting sex and
age (for parents only); and then fitting
sex, age, weight and height together;
and, last, seasonality effects were also
included in the regression equation. The
two variables, weight and height, were

better predictors of blood pressure than
Quetelet’s index and were preferred in
analysis. The results are summarized in
Table 2. It is notable that in parents,
both for SBP and DBP, the coefficient
for sex was not significantly different
from zero. The age effect was predominantly linear for SBP, but for DBP the
quadratic term (age’) was significant.
Age accounted for more than 50 per
cent of the explained variance in blood

“regression. The effects of weight and

Sparents both for SBP and DBP. Season
Awas significant for DBP only. The total
cocontribution of these variables to the ex

plained variability in parents was 18.2
per cent in SBP and 18.3 per cent in
DBP. The effect of sex was statistically
significant in children for SBP. Weight
and height contributed 67 per cent of the
explained variance (R?) in SBP and
over 80 per cent in DBP. As found previously in parents, seasonality had a
significant effect on DBP only. We used
the appropriate estimated partial regression coefficients in order to adjust
blood pressure values for these independent variables prior to the next step in
the analyses. The adjusted SBP and
DBP values were then rescaled using
the logarithmic transformation in order
to normalize the distributions.

We next tested the hypothesis that
the coefficients for age, weight, height,
and seasonal effects were similar in both
sex groups. In general, the set of these
coefficients was found to be homogeneous across the sex groups. However,
since single independent variables were
different, we undertook a sex-specific
adjustment by running the multiple linear regression separately for males and
for females (sex-specific adjustment).
Once the best regression was determined, the residual was standardized in
each sex generation group to have a
mean value of zero and standard deviation of one. This standardization was
achieved by subtracting the mean predicted value of the appropriate sex and
generation group from the observed
value and then dividing by the standard
deviation of that group. A logarithmic
transformation was then applied.

Table 3 presents estimates for variances, skewness, and kurtosis for adjusted values of SBP and DBP before
and after the transformation. In parents
most of the departure from normality

Social Biology

was removed, although in some cases
the estimated skewness and kurtosis parameters were still significantly different
from zero. In children the log, transformation removed the skewness and the
kurtosis from SBP distribution. For
DBP in youngsters, untransformed values approximated the normal distribution more than the transformed and
were used in analysis.

RESULTS

The simple spouse correlations for
unadjusted SBP and DBP were 0.002,
statistically not different from zero (Table 4). The correlations for adjusted
SBP and DBP remained close to zero.

Parent-child correlations are presented in Table 4. The unadjusted correlation coefficients between mother and
child for SBP (0.15) and DBP (0.13)
were higher than those between father
and child (0.09). Upon adjustment,
both father-child and mother-child correlations for SBP and mother-child correlations for DBP showed slightly

higher values as compared with the unadjusted correlation coefficients. The
father-child correlations for DBP were
somewhat reduced upon adjustment,
suggesting that part of the association in
DBP was due to father-child similarity
in height and weight. Mother-child correlations for SBP and DBP were consistently higher than those of father-child,
yet these differences were not statistifally significant.

hanced after controlling for age, height,
weight, and seasonality. The same trend
was noted for mother-child associations
on unadjusted data, but was reversed
upon adjustment. None of these sex differences in the correlation coefficient
reached conventional levels of statistical
significance.

When analysis was limited to families
in whom the child belonged to the random sample invited to Visit II the results
were almost identical. Thus addition of
the high lipid group did not bias the familial blood pressure correlations on the
one hand and served to increase the
sample size on the other. The analyses
were repeated using the mean of the two
standard mercury sphygmomanometer
measurements. The observed correlations were almost identical to those
based on the first reading only and described in Table 4. The father-child correlation for unadjusted SBP was 0.093,
mother-child r = 0.157, and for unadjusted DBP the father-child correlations
were 0.094 and the mother-child were
0.133.

When mean blood pressure values
were analyzed according to the origin of
the parents, European fathers tended to
have the highest SBP (126.8) and DBP
(82.1) levels while the lowest mean levels were recorded in the North African
group (SBP, 123.5; DBP, 79.8). Asian
mothers showed the highest mean values both for SBP (122.5) and DBP
(78.6), but differences were less marked
among the ‘“‘homogeneous’’ origin
groups. The North African male youngsters were similar to their fathers in
showing the lowest mean values both for
SBP (110.7) and DBP (70.9) while the
highest mean values were recorded in
the Israeli group (SBP, 115.8; DBP,
72.1). The rank order of mean blood
pressure levels for the daughters was

Social Biology

similar to that of their mothers but the
differences among the origin group was
relatively small.

Spouse, parent-child, and mid
parent-child correlations by ethnic origin are presented in Table 6. Spouse correlations for unadjusted SBP were significantly different from zero for those
who were born in Europe or in Asia
(0.13-0.14). After adjustment, these
correlations were reduced, particularly
in Europeans, and were not significantly
different from zero. For DBP, spouse
correlations were almost zero with unadjusted measures, and none were significant after adjustment. Both for adjusted SBP and DBP the highest positive spouse correlations were observed
in the Asian group (0.09-0.10) and the
greatest negative correlation coefficients were in the North African group
(—0.14 to —0.16). Nevertheless a test
for heterogeneity in spouse correlations
among the four origin groups revealed
no significant differences (xj) = 4.16
for SBP and 4.05 for DBP).

The parent-child correlations for adjusted blood pressure demonstrated the
following pattern within the origin
groups. In each of the European and the
Asian groups three out of the four
parent-child correlations (mother-child,
father-child for SBP and DBP) were relatively high (r = 0.20). In the North
African group the opposite was observed, and three out of four parentchild correlation coefficients were relatively small (0.03-0.10). The Israeli
group showed intermediate results, with
one small, one relatively high, and two
modest parent-child correlations in the
range of 0.10-0.13. These ethnic differences in associations were not statistically significant.

tions for DBP were in the same direction but the differences were less
marked. Similar results were observed
in the mid parent-child correlations for
which the highest coefficients were seen
in families whose fathers had 5+ years
of religious education. For SBP, the mid
parent-child correlations were of similar
magnitude, with the group with most religious education having the highest
value (r = 0.23). For DBP, the adjusted mid parent-child correlation was
0.26 in the most religious group, more
than double the mid parent-child correlation coefficients in the other two
groups.

Table 8 provided results from multiple regression analysis which predict
children’s blood pressure using the following predictors: cigarette smoking,
low density liproprotein cholesterol
(LDL-C), and hematocrit level as measured when children were examined.
Paternal and maternal blood pressure as
well as years of religious education of
the head of the family were included in
the regression analysis. Since we used an

Friedlander and Kark

Social Biology

ordinal variable with three classes for
describing the degree of religiosity (religious education), we used two indicator
variables and considered the group with
no religious education as the referent.
Paternal and maternal SBP contributed
significantly and independently of the
other parent’s blood pressure to the prediction of SBP level of their offspring in
both sexes. The other predictors of children’s SBP varied slightly in the two sex
groups. A notable feature in this analysis was the inverse association of religious education with the SBP, yet these
contributions were not statistically significant. Father’s or mother’s DBP were
the best predictors of DBP of boys only
when entered alone into the regression
(without the second parent’s DBP
value). No independent contribution of
both parents were observed. In girls the
maternal DBP showed a strong independent effect. Two other highly significant contributors to the prediction of
DBP in girls were cigarette smoking and
the religiosity of head of the family
(both inversely associated).

Finally, one-way analyses of variance

statistical significance of the trend of the

the offspring blood pressure was, in addition, adjusted for cigarette smoking,

whose fathers had 1-4 years of religious

DISCUSSION

Clinicians have recognized for years
that hypertension is more common in
relatives of hypertensives than in relatives of normotensive persons (Gearing
et al., 1962; Pickering, 1968). Other
family studies have revealed familial aggregation of blood pressure among first
degree relatives (Havlik et al., 1979;
Johnson et al., 1965; Hayes et al., 1971).
Miall et al. (1967) and Miall and Oldham (1963) showed more than twenty
years ago that familial aggregation is
well established by the age of 16. Other
studies have demonstrated intrafamilial
aggregation of blood pressure even at
younger ages (Zinner et al., 1971; Hennekens et al., 1976). Parent-offspring
correlation are fairly similar to those observed in other studies (Havlik et al.,
1979; Johnson et al., 1965; Hayes et al.,
1971). A notable exception to this pattern was the small father-daughter correlationin DBP (r = 0.05) after adjustment for height and weight.

One of the approaches taken by us as
well as by other investigators was to adjust for factors which are well known to
influence blood pressure (Tyroler, 1977;

Ward et al., 1979). Only a small fraction
of the association in blood pressure appeared to be caused by similarity or dissimilarity in age, height, weight, and
seasonality. Results from a study cn familial aggregation in a highly inbred
Arab community near Jerusalem (Abu
Gosh) revealed father-child SBP and
DBP correlations ranging from 0.12 to
0.15, similar to those observed by us
(Hurwich et al., 1982). However, their
mother-child correlation was smaller
than ours and statistically not different
from zero.

Our significant parent-child correlation which appears to be uniform in the
various sex combinations (except for
father-daughter DBP correlation), after
the correction for the known blood pressure correlates available in our data set,
suggests either an independent genetic
effect or the effect of undefined additional shared environmental factors.
Different studies, using various methods, attempted to quantify the relative
importance of the genetic component of
variation in blood pressure. Focusing
upon twin and sib similarities and the
difference between (positive) parentchild correlations and (absent) spousespouse blood pressure associations,
their results are consistent with a genetic
contribution to the aggregation of blood
pressure among biologic relatives.

In many studies the relationship between spouses has been examined since
they share the same household environment but generally are not genetically
related. Several studies have suggested
that some environmental factors are
reflected in blood pressure correlation
since spouse correlation was found to be
a function of duration of marriage
(Hayes et al., 1971; Chazan and Winkelstein, 1964; Winkelstein et al., 1966).
Many other studies showed conflicting

Social Biology

results (Gearing et al., 1962; Miall et al.,
1967; Schull et al., 1977). Sackett
(1975), while reviewing this controversy, suggested that spouse concordance in blood pressure does exist, since
in many cross-sectional studies the observed low correlation attained statistical significance. Further evaluation of
spouse correlations of blood pressure
revealed that after adjustment for age,
weight, and other correlates only a small
correlation remained (Feinleib et al.,
1970). Data on spouse longitudinal relationship of blood pressure have shown
no major changes over time (Sackett et
al., 1975), and the explanation for the
small correlation in spouses is attributable more to assortative mating and less
to shared household environment.

Our data failed to detect evidence of
spouse aggregation in SBP and DBP,
even prior to adjustment for age,
weight, and other correlates, except in
the most religious group. Since no data
were available with regard to the duration of marriage, and the children of the
couples were at least 17 years old, we assumed that the length of marriage in our
population is positively associated with
the age of the mother; no consistent
changes in spouse correlation were observed with increasing age of mother.
Simple comparison of the low but consistent correlation between biologic relatives with the lack of association between spouses suggests that genetic
factors may be of greater importance
than shared environment in this population. Others, who utilized more appropriate models, estimated the fraction of
the phenotypic variability attributable
to genetic factors between 0.24 and 0.34
for SBP and 0.18-0.30 for DBP (Ward
et al., 1979; Annest et al., 1979; Morton
et al., 1980). Nonconclusive results emerged when the relative fraction of

 
Vol. 31, No. 1-2

shared environment effects was estimated from these genetic models. This
fact was explained by the heterogeneity
of culture and living conditions among
the populations sampled (Annest et al.,
1979).

Previous studies of blood pressure
pattern in the adult Israeli population
revealed no definite ethnic differences
(Sive et al., 1971). However, in youngsters (Kark 1977; Epstein et al., 1981;

Lewis et al., 1982), including the JerusaSlem LRC data, ethnic differences are evident. In other populations differences
Ebetween races were well documented
A(Tyroler, 1977; Epstein and Eckhoff,
91967). The Jewish population consists
<mainly of immigrants who came from di=-verse countries in which they had been
"living in various degrees of isolation for
—centuries. Differences were notable
Samong Europeans, Asians, and North
= African Jews when they immigrated to
‘S Israel, in the sense of genetic markers,
‘Sculture, and demographic background
2 (Cohen, 1971; Karlin et al., 1979). How“ever, we do not know the BP distribu‘Etion of the Jewish communities in their
countries of origin. During the last 35
syears the Israeli population has gone
through pronounced economic and cul‘tural changes. It is quite unclear
"= whether the Westernized economic and
6 cultural experience adopted by the general population caused the relative
homogeneity in BP levels and BP family
correlations across ethnic group or
whether these small differences existed
at the time of immigration.

The generally similar spouse-spouse
and parent-child correlations among the
ethnic groups are interesting yet not unusual. In a previous analysis performed
on total cholesterol, triglyceride, and
high density liproprotein we have shown
that, although ethnic differences in lipid

Blood Pressure 87

levels in the Israeli population have
been shown (Halfon et al., 1980), the
correlation between household members was relatively homogeneous
(Friedlander et al., 1982). Yet the correlations between first degree relatives for
total cholesterol, high density cholesterol, and even in triglyceride were
higher than those observed for SBP and
DBP. One of the possible explanations
is that transient environmental determinants more strongly affect BP, and this
might lead to reduced correlations of BP
as compared with those of blood lipids.

Another indirect indication of the involvement of environmental factors is
derived from differences in the BP correlations according to the degree of religious education of the head of the family. As observed in Table 7, the most
religious families had higher spouse correlations than the rest. There was a suggestion of a similar pattern in the mid
parent-child BP correlations although
these differences were less marked.
When an attempt was made to quantify
the “impact” of parents BP as well as
other factors on offspring BP values, an
independent negative association of degree of religiosity was observed for
DBP, highly significant in girls.

The extreme religious subgroup in
Jerusalem is an isolated and closely-knit
community. This group is characterized
by markedly different distributions of
several physiological and psycho-social
variables as compared with their
counterparts—citizens of Jerusalem
who are less- or non-religious. The small
group of extreme religious people get
married generally within their own community, and this could be a source of potential bias which could have produced
differences in spouse correlations. The
religious group differs from the general
population in a set of physical factors

and associated variables. They have
higher weight, they smoke less, and they
are characterized as a relatively sedentary group. Because of religious obedience, almost no foodstuffs are consumed outside their home, and for the
same reason they probably consume
more salt through the rigidly kosher
treatment of meat. Part of these variables are known to be associated with BP
(Henry and Cassel, 1969; Kotchen,
1977) and could strengthen the relative
importance of shared environment in
this group and consequently explain
part of the differences in BP correlations.

Another set of variables which could
contribute to the explanation of the differences in BP aggregation between the
“isolated” religious community and the
others is composed of psycho-social factors. Previous work has shown evidence
for the role of psycho-social factors influencing BP (Henry and Cassel, 1969).
Our extreme religious community Is
generally characterized by its low socio
 

Social Biology

economic level, crowded living, high
fertility rates, and the strong social cohesiveness and social orientation of a
traditional culture which emphasizes the
belief in an omnipotent deity and the pedantic observance of behavioral rules as
given in the Bible. They are less exposed
to cultural changes and are very strict
with their childrens’ traditional and separatist education. This way of life, characterized by unchallenged traditional
orientation, could contribute to familial
common environment and consequently result in higher BP correlations.

In summary, the significantly higher
spouse correlation in the religious group
could reflect both a greater tendency for
assortive mating and a traditional, unchanging, and clearly determined lifestyle in this group. In addition, a relligious ‘“‘protective”’ effect may be
transmitted to the children (daughters
had considerably lower BP). However,
lack of a similar finding in sons raises
some doubt as to this association.
