Information about the Juruna Indians
dates back to 1625, when Parente (1874)
localized them near the mouth of the Xingu
River. Adalbert (1849) seems to have been
the first to give a population estimate of the
Juruna. As for the Indians of the Upper
Xingu River, the first data were obtained
in Karl von den Steinen’s first expedition
which took place in 1884. A few years later
(1896) Herman Meyer also explored the
area. With Meyer came Karl E. Ranke, who
collected valuable information about the
health status of these Indians and the
demography of two villages of Trumai and
Nahuqua Indians (Ranke, 1898). Since
then, numerous papers have appeared, especially on the ethnology of these groups.
Data about their blood groups and physical
status have also been reported in some ten
articles during the last twenty years, However, the demographic information is scanty,
scattered over many sources, and generally
includes only population numbers. The
present report will describe demographic
data collected by the senior author during
four months of field work, in 1966 and 1967,
among the Juruna Indians of this region.

analyzed and compared with earlier reports
about the genetic structure of other Brazilian and Venezuelan Indians (Salzano, 1961,
1964; Salzano, Neel, and Maybury-Lewis,
1967; Neel and Chagnon, 1968).

POPULATION SIZE

Table 1 presents the figures we have been
able to collect concerning the population
sizes of the Juruna from 1842 to 1967. The
first estimate of 2,000, by Adalbert, may be
too high, since Nimuendaju (1948) reports
only 235 Indians in 1859. The fact is that by
the end of the nineteenth century the
Juruna were on the verge of extinction.
After they moved from the Lower and Middle to the Upper Xingu the process of decline
in numbers was interrupted, and the present
population seems to be at the replacement
level.

Present-day Juruna live in an area near
the Diauarum Post of the Xingu National
Park, between latitude 10°55’ south and
longitude 53°20’ west. When Galvdo (1952)
visited them in 1950, they were grouped ina
single village near the mouth of the Manitsaud river, on the left side of the Xingu.
However, Simdes (1963) later observed a
split into two villages, due to internal prob

lems. A group, led by the Indian Daa,
moved to a new location on the right bank
of the Xingu, while the remainder of the
tribe stayed in the same place, under the
direction of another leader (Bibina). However, by 1967 a large part of the splinter
group had returned to their original location, with the exception of a single family of
five persons, and there are indications
that this family will also return to Bibina’s
village.

population, This is also reflected in the estimated average age. The Juruna show the
lowest average age among the females (16),
when compared with the Xavante (18),
Yanomamé (21), and Caingang (23); and
the second lowest frequency among the
males (19, as compared with 17 among the
Xavante and 21 and 23 among the Yanomamé and Caingang respectively). As for
the sex ratio, there is a slight predominance
of males, as is true for the other series.

AGE AND SEX DISTRIBUTION

Table 2 shows the age and sex distribution of the individuals studied and compares them with similar information available on three other Brazilian tribes, as well
as with the age distribution of the Xingu
tribes in general (Nutels, 1968).1 It should be
mentioned that in relation to the Juruna we
are sure that our enumeration is complete.
The large percentage of individuals in the
age class 0-14 years among the Juruna (52%,
against 44% in the other Xingu groups, and
lower values in the other tribes mentioned)
points to the process of demographic recovery which is occurring in the Juruna

senior author and correlated with information from
the Indians and from Mr. Claudio Villas Boas, ad
ministrative head of the Diauarum Post, who gave
estimates of the ages of the older individuals.

Among the Juruna this predominance is restricted to the age class 15-30,

ENDOGAMY AND INBREEDING

The frequencies in per cent of endogamous and exogamous marriages observed
among the Juruna, compared with similar
data from the Xavante and Caingang, are
presented in Table 3. For the Juruna we
were able to draw a pedigree which included
all members of the present population, and
the figures concerning marriages extend for
six generations. There is a fair amount of
exogamy, compared to the exogamous marriages observed among the Caingang, while
the Xavante present a somewhat higher
frequency of marriages in which both
partners came from outside the community.
Six different tribes contributed individuals

to the Juruna exogamous marriages, namely, the Kamayurd, Kayabi, Suyd, Taconhapé, Trumai, and Xipdya. There were no
preferences according to sex in these exogamous unions. In eleven such marriages involving ten individuals from outside, five
were men and five women.

211

Despite the fact that there is some
exogamy, the degree of inbreeding found
among the endogamous Juruna is of such a
nature that the average inbreeding coefficient is one of the highest thus far calculated for any human community. As can be
seen in Table 4, this coefficient (0.022) is

more than four times larger than those calculated for the Xavante and Caingang
(0.004 and 0.005, respectively). This is due
to the high percentage of multiple consanguinity observed in marriages among the
Juruna. As a matter of fact, in one of these
marriages the two spouses were connected
by no less than eight different routes of consanguinity. The inbreeding coefficient observed is a little higher than the one we
would obtain if all spouses in this population
were second cousins.

ably be true for the Juruna-Caingang comparison, if the number of mothers studied
among the first group were larger.

It should be noted that after the age
group 10-14 all Juruna women are or have
been married. There are, however, two
widows and one divorced woman who presently do not have husbands because the
only prospective male available cannot
marry either one of them. The two widows
are daughters of his sisters, while the divorced woman is his own sister. No sterility
was observed among the married women.
Polygamy, once prevailing among the
Juruna, is presently absent.

The mortality among the Juruna seems
to be low for a population at this cultural
level. We have been informed that of the 42
live births registered only four children had
died at the time of the investigation (all before reproducing). Therefore, the average
number of surviving offspring (2.9) is only
9% lower than the average number of live
births (3.2). This compares favorably with
the values observed among the Indians in the
nineteenth century: Xingu, 62%; Kuikuro,
58%; Caingang, 38%; Xavante, 36%; Bororo, 30%; and Yanomamé, 16% (for references, see footnotes to Tables 2 and 5).

The breeding size of the Juruna population (number of actual progenitors) is 22,
that is, 38% of the total population, and its
effective size (Li, 1955) can be estimated as
12 (21% of the total). The relative proportions of these three parameters are of the
same order of magnitude as the ones observed among the Xavante (Salzano, Neel,
and Maybury-Lewis, 1967) and Caingang
(Salzano, 1961, 1964).

DISCUSSION

Some significant features are appearing
as data accumulate on the demography of
groups that may be called “primitive’—

were prevalent in the early phase of human
history, who present archaic cultural fea

tures, and who are illiterate. Populations
relying mainly on hunting and gathering,
with incipient agriculture, can be characterized as follows: (a) Their genetic structure
is of a fission-fusion type (Neel and Salzano,
1967); that is, the pattern is one of exchange carried out mainly by more or less
large subgroups of the tribe. (b) Mortality
and fertility are lower than among groups
of agriculturalists. (c) There is a high marriage frequency and a low occurrence of
sterility; with few exceptions every adult
female must be regarded as a member of the
reproducing population. (d) In tribes with
polygamy there may be a disproportionate
reproduction of a selected few, with a
greater variance in the number of surviving
offspring for males whose reproduction is
completed than for similar females.

To what extent does the Juruna demography fit this pattern? Before answering
this question, we must examine the history
of this group. They have had contacts of
different kinds with the frontier of the
Brazilian civilization for more than a
century now. The first consequences of this
contact were disastrous and almost led to
the extinction of the group. After they retreated to more inaccessible places, they
were able to partially recover. But their culture does not seem to have suffered too
much during the process; they still keep
many of their traditional patterns, institutions, and beliefs (Oliveira, 1968). This explains why many features of their demography are still those of relatively ‘untouched” groups. Among these features we
can mention their “moderate” mortality
and fertility, high frequency of marriage
and absence of sterility, and their relatively
large exogamy index. Their high coefficient
of inbreeding, however, may simply reflect
the extreme reduction in size they suffered,
accompanied by a desire to survive as an
independent group. It is of some interest
that the Emerillon and Wayana Indians of
French Guiana, who also experienced an

analogous process, also present relatively
high inbreeding coefficients, 0.014 and 0.011,
respectively, (Sutter, 1966). The presentday absence of polygamy among the Juruna
can also be explained by their small population and their incest taboos.

The understanding of man’s past and
future evolution depends to a great extent
on the knowledge of the genetic structure of
groups which Jived in prehistoric times. But
despite the importance of the subject, relatively few quantitative investigations have
been conducted on populations living at the
hunting and gathering cultural level. It is
hoped that in the near future new studies
will be conducted by different researchers in
many parts of the world, in an effort to find
the significant common denominators that
have guided our evolution.

SUMMARY

Population sizes of the Juruna Indians
from 1842 to 1967 are reviewed. After a
period of acute demographic decline, they

Social Biology

were able to partially recover, and the
present-day population seems to be at the
replacement level. They show moderate
fertility and mortality, high marriage frequency and absence of sterility, and a fair
number of exogamous marriages combined
with a very high degree of inbreeding. The
importance of studying the demography of
groups living at different cultural levels for
a better understanding of man’s evolution is
stressed.
