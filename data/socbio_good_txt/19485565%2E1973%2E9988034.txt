Perhaps because of the current emphasis
placed on what has come to be called the
“population problem” in our society, the
important phenomenon of childlessness has
been somewhat neglected in the literature.
We define childlessness as the state where a
married couple have not given birth to a
child, although they may have adopted one
or more children. Many assume that having
children is inevitable for any given couple
unless proper methods of birth control are
utilized. Estimates of childlessness by family
specialists have varied from 6% to 15%
(Martinson, 1960, p. 375; Bowman, 1965,
p. 105-107). Current estimates from more
direct sources would fix the extent of childlessness at 6.4% for women aged 30 to 34
and at 8.9% for women 40 to 44 (USS.
Bureau of the Census, 1969).

In a previous study, we described the
relationship of childnessness and color
(Kunz and Brinkerhoff, 1969). Our paper
concluded that, contrary to popular belief,
childlessness was more prevalent among
nonwhites than whites. When a 5% national
sample was examined, with several variables
controlled, childlessness was at least 5%
higher among nonwhites than whites, and in
some nonwhite subgroups it was over 10%

higher. These differences remained when
age cohort, age married, and husband’s education were controlled separately or simultaneously.

Our findings were criticized by Veevers
(1970) who failed to note that we selected
women of 35 to 54 years of age because
they would presumably have finished their
childbearing. Using much younger women
in her study, she argues for a reversal of
our findings; however, inasmuch as her
samples were still in the childbearing age,
the conclusions can only be speculative.
Certainly, as both of these articles stress,
further study is needed.

The purpose of this paper is to explore
another widely held stereotype—that of the
poverty-stricken family always having more
children than they want or can afford. Rainwater (1960, p. 3) states:

In this country, the problem of having more
children than are wanted or can be adequately supported is largely confined to persons of one social group—a fact immortalized in the hyperbolic phrase “The rich get
richer and the poor get children.” As family
limitation has become an increasingly rational process, the middle class has been
able to limit family size quite effectively in
terms of whatever goals its members set for
themselves. Traditionally and in reality, it
is the “poor people’—the working class,
and the lower class—who have too many
children.

Rainwater’s work is often used as substantiation of the belief that all the poor are
prolific. In a brief summary of the data
available from the Bureau of the Census,
Grabill and Glick (1959, p. 86) found
that: “the proportion of wives who are
childless is relatively high in the low-income

_ groups, whereas the opposite situation

might be expected from the traditional pattern of highest fertility among the poor.”

The data to examine this apparent contrast between high fertility and the high
incidence of childlessness in the lower-income groups were derived from repository
tables in the 1960 census volume Women
by Number of Children Ever Born (US.
Bureau of the Census, 1964). Because of
advances both in methodology and theory,
it is now possible to obtain data from large
national samples while controlling several
variables.

The sample consisted of white and nonwhite wives from 35 to 54 years of age, who
were married once and whose husbands
were present. This 5% national sample thus
controls for presence of husband and number of times married, which are relevant
considerations for this study. The age category 35-54 represents wives whose families
are “completed” for the most part, so that
the condition of having or not having children can generally be considered a historical
fact for the wives involved. It should be
noted that the sample consists of wives only
and not single, divorced, or widowed women.
While this paper neglects these categories
of women, it provides a group of women
who have presumably been subject to
higher risks of pregnancy.

The total sample includes 13,501,901
wives. Of this number, 1,766,443 or 13.1%
were childless as Table 1 indicates. The
income categories follow the same general
trend. Note, however, that in the next
lowest income category, that of between
$2,000 and $2,999, the percentage of child

lessness increases slightly to 16.1%. Thereafter, the decrease in childlessness is relatively consistent.

This negative correlation between highand low-income categories substantiates
our proposed thesis that childlessness has
a higher incidence in the lower income
categories.

There is the possibility that other variables may explain this apparent difference
between low- and high-income categories;
that is, an intervening variable may be
responsible for this variation. The remainder of this paper will explore some of
these variables.

COLOR OF RESPONDENTS

In our previous article (Kunz and
Brinkerhoff, 1969), we found that a greater
proportion of nonwhite than white wives
are childless. Table 2 indicates what happens to the relation of income and childlessness when color is controlled.

As is apparent from Table 2, the color

control does not destroy the inverse relationship of income and childlessness. It may
be noted that in the white population the
decrease in childlessness is slow and steady,
accounting for a total decrease of 4.4%.
However, in the nonwhite population the
percent childless by income categories
is quite erratic, starting with an incidence
rate of 18.6% for the lowest income grouping and then jumping 4.3% in the $2,000
to $3,999 category to 22.9%, then moving
slightly upward again in the next category
to 23.1% before falling to 17.5% and
14.8% in the two highest income categories,
a total decline in incidence from lowest to
highest income category of 3.8%.

OCCUPATIONS OF HUSBANDS
OF RESPONDENTS

Another pertinent control variable which
was available in the census data is the occupational level of the husbands. While wives
are being described, the occupation of the
husband is a significant influence on the
family situation and therefore included
here. This necessitates using smaller numbers in some categories. Thus, there are
few professionals earning less than $1,999.
This will not, however, hamper our study
as we are primarily basing our comparisons
on percentages. As is apparent in Table 3,
there are steady decreases in the childless
column as income increased in all occupation groups but four: craftsmen, operatives,
laborers, and farmers. Although the total
trend is still one of decrease, it should be
noted that in these four categories rather
erratic curves are presented. These are all
on the lower level in terms of the occupational categories. While service workers are
also concentrated in the lower income
groups, they do not follow the pattern of
the other form, but rather show steadily decreasing childlessness as income rises. Perhaps their greater contacts with people give
them a broader field of knowledgeable in

EDUCATION OF HUSBANDS
OF RESPONDENTS

In controlling for education, three categories were used: No High School, High
School, and College. The results appear in
Table 4. Note the very high rate of child

lessness among wives of college-educated
husbands in the lowest income category.
These may be people striving for upward
mobility and represent voluntary childlessness to a large extent.

The three variables—race, occupational
level, and educational level of the husband
—do not destroy the apparent higher incidence of childlessness among couples where
the husbands have lower incomes.

DISCUSSION

There may be many reasons why childlessness and income are related in this way.
One reason may involve prenatal health
care. A woman from a higher income bracket
finds it much easier to go to a doctor with
her physical problems during pregnancy
than a woman without the money for this
“extra.” Often, low income mothers report
to the doctor for the first time at the time
of delivery. Lack of medical care may
result in pregnancy losses for low-income
women.

A second factor may be the lack of
money to obtain medical help for correctable problems which prevent or reduce the
possibility of conception, such as low sperm
count which may be solved by artificial
insemination.

A third factor may be that wealthy
families can simply afford to have more
children (Kunz, 1965). Children are probably less of a financial burden to them.

In any event, there are many low-income
couples who do not have children and thus
warrant more attention than demographers
have thus far given them. Family researchers need to study this rather numerous minority in more detail.
