and Estimates of Fecundability

in Rural and Semiurban Areas of Certain

Latin American Countries

ABSTRACT: From data collected in national fertility surveys in rural and semiurban areas of Mexico,
Costa Rica, Colombia, and Peru, this paper analyzes for all noncontracepting women in sexual
unions the probability of conceiving and conception delay by duration from the date of entry into
unions. The similarity of the proportions conceiving and of estimates of fecundability among the
four countries suggests the importance of biological factors. Though overall mean fecundabilities
are somewhat low compared to other populations, this difference is largely due to the lower mean
age at entry into unions rather than to lower age-specific fecundabilities.

One of the important but difficult areas
of investigation in fertility is that of fecundability, or the probability of conception.
Fecundability, along with many other variables, determines the observed reproductive behavior. In developed societies with
a high use of contraception, fecundability
may be of less relevance to the study of
fertility. However in noncontraceptive societies, fecundability could be one of the
prime determinants of fertility.

Defining fecundability as the “‘probability of conceiving during a month in the
absence of conscious efforts to limit procreation” leads to the interesting question
of why the sizes of families often vary
widely in noncontraceptive societies. Hutterites have a mean completed family size
of eleven children, while six children, or
even fewer, is the mean In some communities in India and Africa. Nuptiality patterns by themselves cannot explain such
large differences. Differential lactation

amenorrhea is important in explaining
some of the variation in natural fertility.
But some variation could also be due to
differences in fecundability.

Fecundability variations among societies are largely due to behavioral factors rather than biological ones. The probability of conceiving in a given month
depends on frequency of sexual intercourse, distribution of intercourse within
the menstrual cycle, and the length of periods of separation of husband and wife
(Leridon, 1977). Empirical studies of fecundability based on birth histories are
few. Estimates in these studies vary from
0.144 and 0.180 in the United States (Potter and Parker, 1964; Westoff et al., 1961)
and from 0.163 in Taiwan (Jain, 1969) to
0.318 in eighteenth-century European
populations (Henry, 1964). Differences in
the characteristics of the sample population make the validity of comparisons
tenuous.

The objective of this paper is to provide
estimates of probability of first conception
and fecundability in certain Latin American populations in the absence of contraceptive use.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data for this study come from fertility surveys done in the rural and semiurban areas (less than 20,000 population) in
Costa Rica, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru.
The surveys were conducted in 1969 and
1970 under the direction of CELADE
(Centro Latinamericano de Demografia)
and known as PECFAL rural fertility surveys. Altogether, about 10,000 women of
all marital statuses in the age group 15-49
were interviewed. However, the analysis
of this paper is restricted to women who
entered sexual unions and never used contraception in order to measure probabilities of conception among women exposed
to the risk of pregnancy.

Complete contraceptive histories were

not collected in the survey so that nonuse
periods among women who were presently using or had ever used contraception
cannot be identified. Ideally, we should
eliminate only those who were using contraception in the interview in which we are
interested. As this was not possible, we
decided to exclude all those who had used
contraception at any time. The exclusion
of these women is not likely to be serious
as the proportion of such women was low.
The percentage of women who had ever
used contraception was only 32 per cent in
Costa Rica, 18 per cent in Colombia, 9 per
cent in Mexico, and 9 percent in Peru. It is
quite possible that most of these women
had not used contraception in the first interval, but a conservative approach was
taken by excluding them altogether.

First intervals were calculated in
months. Information on date of entry into
sexual union, date of end of a pregnancy,
and date of interview were coded in calendar month and year. The length of gestation was coded in months. Closed first inDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

terval was calculated by subtracting the
date of entry into union from the date of
end of pregnancy and then subtracting the
period of gestation. For example, if the
date of entry into a sexual union was October, 1967, the date of the end of the first
pregnancy was February, 1970 (a stillbirth), and gestation period was 7 months,
the closed first interval was calculated as:
(69 x 12 + 2)-(66 x 12 + 10)-7 = 21
months. For an open first interval, the
date of entry into sexual union is subtracted from the date of interview. A few
cases of bad data indicated by inadmissible intervals were excluded from the analysis. The quality of data seemed to be
fairly high, given the small number of such
discrepancies.

Probability of first conception and conception delay for various durations were
calculated by life table methods using both
closed and open first intervals. However,
fecundability estimates were constructed
using only closed intervals, in other words

based on women who had at least one
pregnancy.

RESULTS

PROBABILITIES OF CONCEPTION AND
CONCEPTION DELAY BY DURATION

Probabilities of first conception and
conception delay by duration are presented in Table 1 for all women who were
aged 14 to 25 at the time of entry into first
sexual union. Because of the fairly sizable
number of consensual unions in the sample, all women in unions were included
rather than only those legally married. Exclusion of women who have ever used contraception, though small in number, could
introduce a downward bias in the probabilities as users are likely to be the most fecund who have a greater need to use contraception. While we are not able to
estimate this bias, we want to point out its
possible impact on the figures.

ing pregnant in the first three months of
entering a sexual union or marriage Is
0.327, and hence the probability of pregnancy delay is 0.673. Probabilities decline
over time due to selectivity of the 1,464
women. Only 52 were not pregnant at the
end of five years, with another 47 women
lost to observation.

Conception delays at 12 months for the
four countries are 0.294 for Mexico, 0.323
for Costa Rica, 0.325 for Peru, and 0.270
for Colombia. Thus, more than two-thirds
will become pregnant in the first year. By
the end of the third year, the probabilities
of not becoming pregnant are only 0.073
in Mexico, 0.075 in Colombia, 0.090 in
Peru, and 0.095 in Costa Rica; and by the
end of the fifth year, 0.040, 0.044, 0.049,
and 0.055 respectively.

The similarity among the four countries
at the end of five years is remarkable and
shows that in the absence of contraceptive
use, various biological and behavioral factors are not of much relevance if a
sufficiently long duration is considered. Of
course, distribution within the five-year
period had considerable importance for
intervals and final completed family size.
Though small numbers beyond five years
make the rates less stable, by the end of
eight years the cumulative probability of
pregnancy delay levels off at 0.03 indicating a primary sterility of about 3 per cent
in the sample populations.

entry in first union are calculated from the
data on mean intervals from age at entry
to first conception and its standard errors.
If we assume a beta distribution for fecundability originally proposed by Henry
(1961) and used by others since (Jain,
1969; Potter and Parker, 1964; Majumdar
and Sheps, 1970), the mean fecundability
and its standard error can be estimated as:
a+b-i

mean = (if a >1)
a-l

sp. = Vablat+b+1)(a-1)(a-2) = (ifa > 2)

where

a = 2871(s? -m? + m) and b = ((4-1)(m-1),

representing the mean and variance of the
times to conception observed in the sample. Estimation of the parameters by this
method requires a complete distribution
of first conceptions. Hence, open intervals
have to be excluded. Therefore, the estimates of mean fecundability apply only to
women eventually conceiving. In other
words, apparently sterile women (about 3

per cent) have been excluded. Thus, these
estimates will have a slight upward bias.

Table 2 tests the goodness of fit of the
theoretical beta distribution with the observed data. The fit seems to be reasonably good with indices of dissimilarity (sum
of positive or negative differences) ranging from 4.7 in Colombia to 7.7 in Peru.
The fit is not as good as Jain found for
Taiwan data but is much better than Potter and Parker found for some U.S. data
(Jain, 1969).

The estimates obtained by the above
method of fitting are presented in Table 3,
with the underlying pregnancy intervals in
Table 4. The overall estimates of fecundability based on all sample women are very
similar in the four countries. The probability of conceiving in a month in Mexico Is
0.145 for a single woman exposed to the
risk or, expressed differently, 145 per
1,000 women. It is slightly higher than 140
in Colombia, 138 in Costa Rica, and 135 in
Peru. These estimates are somewhat

 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 26, No.3

lower than the 163 found in a similar study
in Taiwan.

As the overall estimate is affected by
the age distribution of the sample women,
fecundability estimates are calculated by
age at entry into union (Table 3). Though
small sample sizes make these estimates
less stable, an age pattern is observable.
Fecundability is low at ages 14 and 15, increases with age, and reaches maximum
values at age 23 and 24. The same trend
was also obtained by Jain for the
Taiwanese women. In Mexico, mean fecundability increases from 90 per 1,000 at
age 14 to 253 by age 23. Though there are
greater fluctuations in the intermediate
years, the overall trend is similar in Colombia. Increment with age is less pronounced in Costa Rica and quite erratic in
Peru.

The lower mean fecundability for the
sample women in the four countries when
compared to the Taiwanese sample is in
large part due to differences in the age distribution. Age at entry into sexual unions
is much lower in Latin America than in
Taiwan. Median age at entry around 17 is
almost two years lower than in Taiwan. As
fecundabilities in the teen years are lower
than in the twenties, the overall crude rate
is depressed. If the age distributions of the
four Latin American samples were standardized on Taiwan age distribution, one
finds that in Mexico (179) and Colombia
(179), the rates are higher than in Taiwan

(163), and the rates in Costa Rica (152)

Probability of Conception

231

and Peru (142), though still lower, are
closer to the Taiwan figures.

CONCLUSIONS

Though the four sample populations
were similar in age distribution and were
not using contraception, the proportions
becoming pregnant in the first and second
years after entry into unions were somewhat different indicating the importance
of various behavioral factors. However,
levels of complete sterility may be basically the same as at the end of eight years,
and 97 per cent are likely to conceive in all
the four countries.

Overall, fecundability estimates do not
vary too much among the four countries,
though they are slightly lower than those
found in other studies. However, this is to
a considerable extent due to the much
lower age at entry into unions. Agespecific fecundability rates are comparable to other studies.
