Excess and Deficit Fertility in the

United States, 1965

Considerable attention has recently been
given to enabling couples to have the
number of children they desire. The measure usually advanced to accomplish this
humanitarian goal is a family planning
program. Indeed, this goal has been the
publicly stated rationale for the very existence of national family planning programs
(Hartley, 1972, p. 317). However, it would
be naive to suppose that leading advocates
of these programs are unaware that the
measures they propose have potential
demographic as well as humanitarian value.

The chief demographic value of a national family planning program lies in the
extent to which, through the prevention of
unwanted births, it can contribute to a
lower overall level of fertility. Along this
line, a great deal of attention has been
given lately to assessing the prevalence of
unwanted childbearing and the extent to
which its elimination would contribute to
the stabilization of the population of the
United States (Bumpass and Westoff,
1970; Ryder, 1972; and Commission on
Population Growth and the American
Future, 1972). Thus, Ryder and Westoff
(1972, p. 471) state: “The extent of unwanted fertility is at the core of the debate

 

 

over the kind of fertility policy necessary
to achieve replacement.”

Although the elimination of unwanted
childbearing would of necessity be an essential element of any program to enable
couples to have the number of children
they desire, and only that number, it must
not be thought that the demographic value
attached to the elimination of unwanted
childbearing automatically accrues to programs designed to allow people to have the
number of children they desire. Indeed, a
moment’s reflection leads to the inescapable
conclusion that family planning programs
are incapable of allowing all persons to
have the number of children they desire.

The reason for this is that there are two
types of couples who do not have the number of children they desire to have. One
type has more children than desired. This
has been called “excess fertility” (Harkavy
et al., 1969, pp. 370-371; and Whelpton
et al., 1966, p. 225), a phenomenon that
has been given a fairly extensive treatment
in the demographic literature. The other
type of couples not having the number of
children they desire are those with a family
size smaller than desired, and this has been
called “deficit fertility.”

Although Davis (1967, p. 732) asserted
seven years ago that people in industrial
countries have fewer children than they
would like to have, the occurrence of deficit
fertility has been relatively ignored by the
demographic profession. This is despite the
fact that in national probability samples
in the United States (Whelpton et al.,
1966, p. 53; and Ryder and Westoff, 1971,
p. 74) and Great Britain (Woolf, 1971,
p. 31) the proportion of wives expecting
to have fewer children than they desired
was at least as large as the proportion expecting more than they desired. Weller and
Chi (1973) have demonstrated that a considerable proportion of the deficit fertility
observed in their study is voluntary.

Thus, programs to enable couples to have
the number of children they desire are
not identical with programs to eliminate
unwanted childbearing, and the demographic effects attributed to the latter
should not necessarily be attributed to the
former. This is because if couples really
did have the number of children they desire, and only that number, the elimination
of unwanted births that currently occur
could be counterbalanced by the occurrence
of births that are wanted, yet under current conditions are not expected to occur,
whether this be for voluntary or involuntary reasons,

The present study represents an attempted replication of the earlier study
conducted by Weller and Chi (1973). It
differs in two major respects. The earlier
study utilized a probability sample of residents of only one state, Rhode Island,
whereas the present paper utilizes data
from the 1965 National Fertility Study.
Although certainly useful for heuristic purposes, the results of the Rhode Island study
cannot be generalized to the total United
States population because of the high proportion of Catholics resident there and

Social Biology

because of the ethnic composition of the
population. The second major difference
concerns the manner in which desired
family size, and hence excess fertility, is
measured.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The source of data for this paper is the
1965 National Fertility Study. A detailed
methodological description of the manner
in which these data were collected and of
the representativeness of the sample may
be found in Ryder and Westoff (1971).
For the purposes of this paper, analysis
has been confined to 3,130 women who in
1965 were married (first marriage) with
husband present, who were age 49 or
younger, who gave numerical responses to
items concerning cumulative, desired, and
expected family size, and who have either
been classified as fecund by the original
analysts of the data or who have been
sterilized for contraceptive purposes.

The two major dimensions of family size
examined in this paper are desired and
expected completed family size. For each
woman, these dimensions are compared,
and the outcome of this comparison is used
to determine the fertility behavior classification. When desired family size is larger
than expected family size, this has been
termed deficit fertility; when desired family size is smaller than expected family
size, this has been termed excess fertility;
and when the two coincide, this has been
termed congruent fertility.

Expected completed family size is measured by using responses to question 124
of the National Fertility Study and adding
the additional number expected to the
number of children already born. Essentially the same sort of information was
gathered in the Rhode Island study.

Desired family size has been measured
by using responses to the question: “If you
could have exactly the number of children

 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

Vol. 21, No. 1
you want, what number would that be?”
Note that this question is somewhat different from the question used earlier by
Weller and Chi (1973), who relied upon a
quasi-retrospective and hypothetical measure of desired family size (“If you were
just getting married, how many children
would you like to have?”). The major
difference between these two measures of
desired family size is that the question
used in the present study denotes a less
retrospective orientation. It is also different
from the indirect measure of wanted number of children used by Bumpass and
Westoff (1970) and Ryder and Westoff
(1971).

RESULTS

The women included in this analysis
desire an average of 3.25 children, expect
to have 3.54, and already have 2.79. When
desired and expected completed family size
are compared, 54.6 per cent desire the
same number they expect to have, 27.2
per cent desire fewer children than they
expect to have, and the remaining 18.2
per cent desire more than they expect to

Excess and Deficit Fertility 79

have. These figures are somewhat different
from those reported in the Rhode Island
study, in which 19.3 per cent desired fewer
than they expected and 23.7 per cent
desired more than they expected to have
(Weller and Chi, 1973).

Mean cumulative, desired, and expected
family sizes have been computed for each
of the fertility comparison categories and
are presented in Table 1, along with the
interrelationships between these variables.
It can be seen that the strongest correlation is between children ever born and
expected completed family size, and the
weakest is that between desired family
size and children ever born.

It can also be seen in Table 1 that the
excess fertility women have the lowest desired family size, yet also have the highest
expected and cumulative family sizes. On
the other hand, the deficit fertility women
have the highest desired family size, yet
currently have and expect to have the least
number of children. If all women had the
number of children they desire, completed
family size would be reduced from 3.54 to
3.25. By contrast, if all excess fertility

were eliminated and the deficit fertility
women did not realize their fertility desires, completed family size would average
2.96. Although that would represent a
considerable reduction over the total expected completed family size, it would be
substantially above replacement level.

The remainder of this section will deal
with the various characteristics of the
women and/or spouses in an effort to determine whether or not the outcome of the
fertility comparison is randomly distributed
throughout the sample. Whenever possible,
comparison will be made with the analyses
conducted earlier by Weller and Chi
(1973), Bumpass and Westoff (1970), and
Ryder and Westoff (1971).

CHILDREN EVER BORN

It is clear in Table 1 that the fertility
comparison categories are strongly related
to the number of children ever born. The
higher this number, the greater the probability that the respondent will be classified as expecting excess fertility and the
Jess likely it is that she will be classified in
the deficit fertility category. However, in
the latter case, the decline over parity categories is not monotonic; rather, after three
children, the parity seems to make little
difference. These results are similar to
those observed earlier by Bumpass and
Westoff (1970) and Weller and Chi
(1973).

CURRENT AGE AND DURATION OF MARRIAGE

In the Rhode Island analysis conducted
by Weller and Chi, there was no systematic relationship between current age and
the fertility comparison classification.
When duration of marriage was considered, women married less than five years
were less likely than other women to be in
the excess fertility category, and the longer
the duration of marriage, the more likely
it was that the woman would be classified

Social Biology

as being in the deficit fertility category.
A tabulation by Ryder and Westoff (1971,
p. 58) shows that the size of the difference
between expected and desired family size
is not consistently related to either age of
wife or number of years married among
white women and that the size of this
difference is much smaller among Negro
women under age 20 or who had been
married less than five years.

In the present study, up to age group
35-39, the probability of being classified
in the excess fertility category increases
and the likelihood of being in the congruent
fertility decreases with age. Among those
women over age 19, there is a positive
association between age group and the
probability of being classified as expecting
deficit fertility. When duration of marriage
is considered, women married less than
five years are less likely than other women
to be in the excess fertility category and,
with two exceptions, the greater the duration of marriage, the more likely it is that
the woman will be classified in the deficit
fertility category.

EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT

In their analysis, Weller and Chi (1973)
observed that the greater the wife’s educational attainment, the more likely it is that
she will be in the deficit fertility category.
They also observed that the greater the
husband’s educational attainment, the
greater the probability of congruent fertility and the less likely the occurrence of
deficit fertility. These differences largely
remain when controls for differences in
current parity are introduced. Bumpass
and Westoff (1970, p. 1179) also indicate
an inverse relationship between the wife’s
education and the incidence of unwanted
births, although a major portion of this
difference appears to be attributable to
differences in cumulative fertility. Finally,
Ryder and Westoff (1971, p. 54) introduce
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 21, No. 1

a tabulation showing that the size of the
difference between expected and desired
family size is systematically related to
educational attainment, with “expectedminus-desired” changing from a positive
figure at the lower levels of educational
attainment to a negative figure at the
higher levels of educational attainment.
This is true among both racial categories,
although the relationship seems stronger
among blacks than among whites.

In the present study, there is an inverse
relationship between educational attainment of the wife and excess fertility, and
@ positive association between education
and the incidence of congruent and deficit
fertility. When parity is controlled, the
association between educational attainment
and excess fertility becomes weaker as the
parity group increases, and among the
5-or-more parity women it is present only
among those with at least a high school
education. Wife’s educational attainment
also is positively associated with the incidence of agreement between desired and
expected family size among 0-2 parity
women but this association is much weaker
among 3-4 parity women and is absent
among 5-or-more parity women. This is
consistent with the pattern observed earlier
by Weller and Chi (1973). Finally, after
parity is controlled, wife’s educational
attainment appears unrelated to the incidence of deficit fertility.

OCCUPATION OF HUSBAND

Although Weller and Chi (1973) report
that there appears to be no apparent relationship between husband’s occupation and
the incidence of either excess or deficit
fertility, Ryder and Westoff’s (1971,
p. 240) analyses indicate that white collar
workers are less likely than other males
to have excess fertility.

In the present analysis, when current
parity is not controlled, in general the

Excess and Deficit Fertility

81

higher the prestige of the male’s occupation (cf. Nam, 1963), the less the incidence
of excess fertility. White collar occupation
is clearly differentiated from blue collar
occupation in terms of relative ability to
avoid excess fertility. When current parity
is controlled, this is true only among those
with O-2 children ever born.

FAMILY INCOME

A final socioeconomic characteristic that
may be related to the fertility comparison
classification is family income. Weller and
Chi (1973) report that those with an
annual family income of $10,000 or more
are somewhat less likely than others to
have excess fertility and are much more
likely than others to desire more children
than they expect to have. Controlling for
parity, those in the lowest income category
were the most likely to have excess fertility
and the least likely to have deficit fertility.
Ryder and Westoff (1971, p. 241-242)
report that husband’s income is inversely
related to the incidence of excess fertility
among nonwhites but bears no relationship
among whites.

Similar patterns exist in the present
study. The higher the family income, the
lower the incidence of excess fertility and
the higher the incidence of deficit fertility
and of agreement between desired and
expected family size (although the latter
association is very weak). Although the
regularity of this pattern disappears when
controls for current parity are introduced,
it still is the case that women in families
with a family income of $10,000 or more
are less likely than other women to be
in the excess fertility category and are
more likely than others to be in the deficit
fertility category.

WIFE’S LABOR FORCE STATUS
Another variable that may be related
to the outcome of the comparison between

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

82 Weller

desired and expected family size is the
wife’s labor force status. Weller and Chi
(1973) report that women in the labor
force are more likely than women not in
the labor force to be in the deficit fertility
category and that this difference is most
pronounced in the low (0-2) parity group.
They also report that there appears to
be no relationship between the specific
occupation of the wife and the fertility
classification.

In the present analysis, women not in
the labor force are more likely than other
women to be in the excess fertility category
and are less likely to be in the deficit
fertility category. As in the earlier analysis,
there appears to be no systematic relationship between the comparison and the
specific occupation of the woman.

RELIGIOUS PREFERENCE OF WIFE

Weller and Chi (1973) report that
Catholics are more likely than Protestants
to be in the excess fertility classification
and that the difference is largely a function of differences in numbers of children
already born. They also report that church
attendance and the outcome of the comparison between desired and expected family size appear to be unrelated. One of
Ryder and Westoff’s tables (1971, p. 240)
indicates that Catholics are less likely than
Protestants to have excess fertility. However, another table (p. 74) indicates that,
among wives with at least a high-school
education, Catholics are more likely than
Protestants to expect more children than
they desire. Finally, Westoff and Westoff
(1971, p. 229) report that women of both
religious categories have experienced the
same number of unwanted births.

The pertinent tabulations from the present analysis are shown in Table 2. It can
be seen that differences between Catholics
and Protestants are minimal, although both
groups are more likely than “Others” to

 

Social Biology

be in the excess fertility category and are
less likely to be in the congruent fertility
category. With one exception, this pattern
persists when controls for parity are introduced. It is also the case that within each
current parity category, Protestants are
more likely than Catholics to be in the
excess fertility category. It can also be
seen that frequency of church attendance
is not systematically related to the fertility
comparison classification. Controls for
parity do not alter this observation. The
frequency with which Catholics receive the
sacraments also is unrelated to the outcome
of the comparison between desired and
expected family size.

RACE

A final characteristic examined is race.
Ryder and Westoffi’s (1971, pp. 58, 240242) analyses indicate that among Negro
women expected-minus-desired family size
is 0.72 children while among white women
it is —0.06 and that nonwhite couples are
more likely than white couples to have
excess fertility. Bumpass and Westoff
(1970, p. 1178) demonstrate that this
latter differential remains even when birth
order is controlled.

Similar results are obtained in the present study (Table 3). Negroes are more
likely than whites to be in the excess fertility category and are less likely to be
classified as having deficit fertility. This
pattern persists when controls for current
parity are introduced.

Of course, there are also socioeconomic
differences present between the two racial
groups, and it is possible that these account
for the differences observed above. To test
this explanation, I have attempted to compare Negroes and whites while simultaneously controlling for wife’s education,
husband’s occupation (white collar vs. blue
collar), and husband’s income. When this
is done, it appears that the differentials

but that excess-fertility women are characterized by a reliance in the past upon
methods of preventing conception that
require some degree of cooperation on the
part of the male, e.g., rhythm, withdrawal,
and condom. Deficit fertility women, according to Weller and Chi, were less likely
to have ever used any method of preventing conception and had used a slightly
smaller number of methods. This suggested
that the excess fertility women had tried
several methods before finding one that
was effective and acceptable to them and

their spouse. Despite this, deficit fertility
women were not less likely than other
women to be using a method of preventing
conception currently and, given that they
were current users, were not less likely
than other women to “always” use the
method.

When the contraceptive behavior of the
women in the current study is analyzed
the differences between the three categories
of women are minimal (Table 4).

CONCLUSIONS

One conclusion that can be drawn is that
substantial proportions of American women
do not expect to have the number of children that they say they desire to have.
Moreover, it can be concluded that there
are two such types of women—those with
excess fertility and those with deficit fertility. The former seems likely because substantial proportions of women apparently
are unable to prevent unwanted conceptions
with the same contraceptive knowledge and
technology which, for some reason, other
women have been able to use more effectively. The existence of this group is not
surprising, and efforts should be made to
discover exactly why they have more children than they desire and to take appropri
ate steps to remedy the situation, whether
these steps include developing a different
system of delivering contraceptive knowledge and/or technology or whether they
include permitting a socially untraumatic
termination of any such unwanted pregnancies.

However, it also must be concluded that
there is a substantial proportion of women
who expect to have fewer children than
they state they desire to have. The high
proportion of such women in the earlier
study by Weller and Chi (1973) might
have been attributable to the high proportion of Catholics in the sample. Since
Catholics have relatively high family size
desires, it is only reasonable that substantial proportions of a predominantly
Catholic sample should report that their
desired family size is higher than the
number of children they expect to have.
However, this line of reasoning certainly
is not applicable to the present analysis,
for Catholics represent a small proportion
of the total sample, and deficit fertility
does not occur only among the Catholics.

The reader may grant the existence of
such women, yet, very reasonably, ask
“So what?” The answer to this query is
that the existence of such women, in the

proportions reported in this study and in
previous national probability samples,
demonstrates that programs to enable
people to have the number of children they
desire, and only that number, are not
demographically identical to programs to
eliminate unwanted childbearing. Accordingly, demographic benefits that would

 

Excess and Deficit Fertility

accrue to the latter would not necessarily
accrue to the former. Indeed, if the results
obtained in the present studies are meaningful, then it is clear that programs to
attain population stabilization that are
based solely on the premise that each
couple should have the number of children
they desire (and only that number) will
not be completely successful, unless family
size desires are reduced considerably beneath the levels reported in this study.
This conclusion seemingly is at odds with
that drawn by Ryder and Westoff (1971,
p. 93) who state that their analysis of the
National Fertility Study data “supports
actions designed to enable people to have
the number they want rather than attempt
to change the number they want.” Essentially the same conclusion was drawn
earlier by Bumpass and Westoff (1970).

The reason for this disparity is primarily
methodological. I used a direct approach
to measure desired family size, i.e., a question eliciting desired family size directly
from the respondent. Ryder and Westoff
(1971) and, to a certain extent, Bumpass
and Westoff (1970) have chosen to measure
wanted family size. This measure was obtained indirectly. Apparently the respondents were separated into two groups.
Among those who intended to have more
children, wanted family size was measured
as the total number of children the woman
intended to have. Among those who intended to have no more children, the
measure of wanted family size was taken
to be their current parity minus the number reported as having been unwanted at
the time of conception, depending upon
the answers to a series of questions asked
about the circumstances of each pregnancy
in a woman’s history (Ryder and Westoff
1971, p. 93). Ryder and Westoff (1972)
follow a similar procedure and hence reach
similar conclusions.

Given this difference in approaches, the
method of measuring desired family size
utilized in this study yields figures considerably higher than those obtained by
the earlier analysts of the National Fertility Study. As Bumpass and Westoff
(1970, p. 1181) state, married women aged
35-44 in 1965 reported through the direct
(question) approach a desired family size
of 3.4 children, as compared with 2.5 children estimated by their procedure. Ryder
and Westoff (1971, p. 93) report that the
estimate of the number of children wanted
for all women in their sample is 2.7 children
compared with 3.3 children estimated by
the conventional measure of the desired
number of children.

Thus, in evaluating the meaningfulness
of this study, as well as of the earlier
analyses of these same data, one must be
concerned with the measure of desired
family size. Is the direct method utilized
in this study less valid (behaviorally if
not methodologically) than the indirect
measure of wanted family size utilized by
the earlier analysts? That the two methods
produce different levels of family size
targets—both in the aggregate and for
individual women—is obvious. Consequently, there is not a complete overlap
of women classified as being in the excess
fertility category. That is, some of the
women classified by the indirect method
as having excess fertility are not so classified by the direct method used in this
study, and not all women classified as
having or expecting to have excess fertility
by the method used in this study would
be so classified by Bumpass and Westoff.

The primary criticism that Bumpass and
Westoff (1970, p. 1181) have of the direct
approach to measuring desired family size
is that there is considerable rationalization
(and idealization) of past fertility behavior (also see Ryder and Westoff 1971,

Social Biology

p. 27). That this occurs is undeniable.
However, for the 3,130 women included in
the present analysis, the correlation between desired family size (direct question)
and the number of children ever born is
not unity (0.45). Thus, any tautology that
might exist is far from complete. Moreover,
this correlation is lower than that between
desired family size and expected completed
family size (0.57), thus indicating that the
couples’ family size desires represent a goal,
albeit with idealized overtones, rather than
mere rationalization. Surely this would not
be unimportant when considering programs
to enable couples to have the number of
children they desire, and only that number.
Perhaps it was in this vein of thought that
Ryder and Westoff (1971, p. 53-74) devoted the first half of their chapter ‘Racial,
Religious, and Socioeconomic Differences
in Fertility” to comparing expected and
desired family size (measured directly)
across various categories of people.
Bumpass and Westoff contend that when
the indirect method of measuring wanted
family size is utilized, the time focus is
upon evaluation of the event at the time of
pregnancy. They assert (p. 1181):

Although the responses may still be infiuenced by intervening experience, this bias
should be much less than the bias when the
reference is to the present, or to the future
conditioned to the present.

If this reasoning is correct, then their
measure should produce less understatement of the extent of excess fertility than
the direct approach to measuring desired
family size used in the present study.
Actually, both approaches indicate about
the same incidence of excess fertility.
Thus, of the 3,130 women contained in
this analysis, 26 per cent are classified as
having execss fertility using the indirect
approach of Bumpass and Westoff, and
27 per cent are so classified using the
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

Vol. 21, No. 1

direct approach to measuring desired family size. However, as noted earlier, there is
disagreement concerning which particular
women have experienced excess fertility.
Moreover, with few exceptions, the same
differentials associated with having excess
fertility are observed by the direct and
indirect approaches of measuring excess
fertility.

Perhaps the major criticism of the
Bumpass and Westoff procedure is that it
renders impossible the occurrence of deficit
fertility; that is, it assumes that there are
no couples (or women) who desire to have
more children than they expect to have.
This assumption seems questionable to
this writer, for not only are there couples
that are physiologically incapable of bearing as many children as they would like
to bear, but there must also be some couples
who have voluntarily restricted their family size to a number smaller than they
would desire because of the restraints of
their particular socioeconomic situation,
idiosyncratic reasons, etc. The issue is
how many such couples exist, what are
their characteristics in relation to those
of other couples, and why don’t they have

Excess and Deficit Fertility

87

the number of additional children they
desire to have.

Thus, the earlier analysts of the National
Fertility Study have largely drawn our
attention to only one type of deviation
from desired (or wanted) family size. If
one is only interested in “assessing the
demographic implications of perfect contraception” (Bumpass and Westoff 1970,
p. 1181), then this is not a dysfunctional
restriction. Indeed, perfect contraception
could only lower fertility among those
having unwanted fertility and the extent
to which there may also be couples who
desire fertility higher than they currently
expect to have is immaterial because no
contraceptive program would even attempt
to enable these couples to realize their
desires. However, such an approach is inadequate for dealing with the extent to
which women have the number of children
they desire to have.
