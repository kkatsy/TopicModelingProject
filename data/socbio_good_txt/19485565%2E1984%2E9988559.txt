Age-Discrepant Marriages: Cross-National
Comparisons of Canadian-American Trends

 

Jean E. Veevers

Department of Sociology,
University of Victoria,
Victoria, British Columbia, Canada

ABSTRACT: Comparisons of age-discrepant marriages ideally involve data which are collected at
the time of marriage and which are available by single years of age for the same population over
time. Although such data are not available for Canadian-American comparisons, approximations of them are derived from the United States census, from marriage statistics (including
statistics for California and for British Columbia), and from selected fortuitous studies of age at
marriage. Although available data are not conclusive, they suggest that Canada and the United
States do not differ markedly in the incidence of age-discrepant marriages and that both exhibit
longitudinal trends which reflect a decreased incidence of marriages with large husband-wife
age differences and an increased preference for coeval marriages, but exhibit markedly little
change in the incidence of wife-older marriages. Cross-cultural patterns of age-discrepant marriages are suggested as an unobtrusive indicator for comparative assessments of the de facto

status of women.

Although demographers and family
sociologists have examined many aspects of marriage and of family formation, they have seldom focused on the 1ssue of age differences between husbands
and wives. When this issue is raised, it is
typically considered only superficially in
terms of sex differences in the average
age at first marriage. This neglect may
have stemmed in part from the understandable preoccupation with issues relating to fecundity and fertility and with
the perception that husband-wife age
discrepancies were not major determinants of the number and spacing of
births (Cox, 1970, p. 112). However,
age discrepancies are important factors
in the determination of marriage patterns. Moreover, they are significant determinants of the nature and the quality
of husband-wife relationships and have
a number of implications for the status
of women vis-a-vis men (Presser, 1975).
An earlier paper made a preliminary at

tempt to define age-discrepant marriages and to assess their incidence in
Canada (1983a). The purpose of the
present paper is three-fold: first, to outline problems involved with international comparisons of such marriages;
second, to compare their incidence in
Canada and the United States; and
third, to suggest some preliminary comparisons of changing trends.

DATA PROBLEMS AND
LIMITATIONS

Although age-discrepant couples
may be defined in a variety of ways,
there is some concensus that, at least in
the developed Western world, they
would include couples in which the husband is at least ten years older than his
wife or couples in which the wife is at
least five years older than her husband
(Veevers, 1983a). Ideally, comparisons
of distributions of age-discrepant coup

les, whether longitudinal or crossnational, should be based on data which
meet three criteria: first, that they were
collected at the time of marriage; second, that they include precise measures
of age; and third, that they control for
the major confounding variables. In reality, at this point in time, these specifications can only be approximated.

1. Vital Statistics Versus Census
Data.—Vital statistics provide the most
accurate method of assessing the incidence of age-discrepant marriages. Although such data are collected regularly
in the United States, the coverage is not
complete. For example, in 1969, marriage data considered sufficiently complete to warrant publications in totals
for the Marriage Registration Areas
constituted only 77 per cent of the national totals (Williams and Kunh, 1973,
p. 24). If there remains no reason to believe that age-discrepant marriages are
more or less likely to occur in areas included or not included in the marriage
registration data, this is itself not a serious problem.

A more critical issue are problems intrinsic to the use of census data. A survey of all couples cannot measure all
age-discrepant unions, but only those
age-discrepant unions which have persevered to a given point in time. The differential life expectancy of men and
women is well known; in most couples
this fact, combined with a small age difference in favor of the wife, makes it
much more likely that the marriage will
eventually be terminated by his death
rather than by hers. In husbandascendent marriages with a large age
gap, this tendency is markedly pronounced. Jn contrast, the tendency is
counter-balanced in wife-ascendent
marriages, in that the probability of the
husband’s survivorship more closely ap
Age-Discrepant Marriages 19

proximates that of his wife. The result is
that a cross-section of married couples
of all ages will tend to be underweighted
in terms of husband-older marriages and
over-weighted in terms of wife-older
marriages.

In both Canada and the United
States, marriages are increasingly likely
to be terminated by divorce rather than
by death. There is some tentative evidence that age-discrepant couples may
be more likely to divorce than are more
conventional pairings (Monahan, 1953;
Schmitt, 1969; Bumpass and Sweet,
1972). Whether this is a result of selection factors, or of the inferior quality of
such marriages, the result is that the
count of age-discrepant marriages will
be further underestimated by reliance
on census or survey data.

2. Precise Age Grading.—The best
data for assessing age-discrepant marriages are those which give the exact age
of the bride by the exact age of the
groom. Unfortunately, many publications of vital statistics and of census data
use only quinary groupings, which are
imprecise and which underestimate the
extent of husband-older marriages and
overestimate the extent of wife-older
ones (Veevers, 1983a). Such data are of
some utility in doing preliminary work
and in formulating hypotheses (Cox, .
1970; Bytheway, 1981), but by their nature they perforce obscure subtle but important differences.

When marriage statistics are presented by single years of age, these rich
data are frequently given only for young
persons. Thus, in the United States detailed statistics are available for marriages in 1978, but only for persons age
eighteen to twenty-nine (U.S. Vital Statistics, 1978). While this may be adequate for a study of first-time brides, it
represents only 68 per cent of all grooms

and particularly tends to obscure the
atypical situation of an older man marrying a bride many years his junior.
When that does occur, it is impossible to
know the exact discrepancy. Although
data for all marriages by single years of
age for all ages would be ideal, data for
all persons up to age 49 provide an acceptable approximation.

However data were originally collected, one is usually forced to deal with
data as they are published. In the United
States census, all couples with the husband ten or more years senior are combined, thereby obscuring the extent of
variation at the extremes of the distribution. More problematic, however, is the
adoption of a curious convention whereby data are combined for married persons who are the same age or have the
husband one year younger, but are differentiated for couples in which the husband is one year older. In addition, all
couples with the husband two or more
years younger are aggregated, thereby
obscuring the important distinction between wife-ascendent marriages which
involve a three-year difference or a
thirteen-year difference (Veevers,
1983c).

Even if data were available by single
years of age, it would be difficult or impossible to assimilate them in this form.
To be meaningful, it is necessary to
group them in some way. Unfortunately, the categories of such groupings
are almost entirely arbitrary. The perennial problem with cross-national comparisons is that different statistical agencies group data in idiosyncratic ways,
with the result that published statistics
cannot always be compared directly. In
some instances, enough cross-national
work has been done to establish conventions which now enjoy wide currency.
Unfortunately, the question of agedifferences in marriage has not been ad
Social Biology

dressed systematically, and so no conventions have yet been established.
Comparisons therefore involve the torturous recombining of various data into
a standard format. One pattern which is
used by the State of Hawaii and some
other agencies distinguishes exact same
age and then presents data in terms of
wide categories of husband-older or
wife-older possibilities. While this is of
some use, it might also be argued that,
for all practical purposes, persons within
one year of age are the “same” age.
Moreover, since a wife being several
years older than her husband is of more
social significance than the other way
around, grouping of all wife-older marriages into 14 years and 5-9 years tends
to obscure small but important differences. The choice of a standard format is
of course arbitrary and remains an issue
of personal preference.

3. Confounding Variables. Although
little work has been done on agediscrepant marriages, two factors which
are known to be associated with them
and which should be taken into account
in comparisons are race and marital status.

In the United States, patterns of agediscrepant marriages are different for
white than for nonwhite couples. Black
couples tend to have slightly more couples with the wife older and, at the other
end, slightly more couples with the husband markedly older than the wife. This
was true in 1960 and remains true to
1970 (Veevers, 1983b). The racial composition of Canadians cannot be known
exactly since racial origin is not asked on
the Canadian census or vital statistics,
but it can be assumed that most Canadians are white and that the most appropriate comparison groups would therefore be white Americans. Unfortunately, not all data available on marriages
are differentiated by racial origin.

The age discrepancy of bride and
groom is minimal in primary marriages,
that is, those in which both the bride and
groom are getting married for the first
time. While age discrepancy is more
common in remarriages of all kinds,
there are discernible patterns in terms of
the marital histories of the participants.
Husband-older marriages are most
common in marriages in which the
groom has been married before but the
bride is getting married for the first time;
conversely, wife-older marriages are
most common when the bride is getting
remarried but the groom is getting married for the first time. This unusual pattern was first pointed out by Hollingshead (1951) on the basis of a 1948
survey in Connecticut and has been substantiated by examining later census
data (Veevers, 19835). The best comparisons would therefore be made between primary marriages versus all
other marriages. Presumably, variations
in populations can be accounted for

 

Age-Discrepant Marriages 21

partly by variations in the prevalence of
divorced or widowed persons and/or
variations in their propensity to remarry. Unfortunately, the Canadian
census does not include data on marital
history, and vital statistics data often include all marriages.

COMPARISONS OF INCIDENCE

Detailed data on marriages in Canada, and in some of the provinces, are
available over a number of decades. Unfortunately, comparable data are not
available in the United States, in that
marriages by single years of age are usually only given for young persons in their
twenties or early thirties. However, detailed data do happen to be available for
1969, and can be compared with Canada
in 1970 (Table 1). The data suggest that
there is a greater diversity of marriages
in the United States, with a larger proportion of husbands being 10 or more
years senior and of wives being five or

more years senior. By these criteria,
age-discrepant marriages would seem to
constitute 27.3 per cent of all American
marriages, but only 8.6 per cent of all
Canadian ones. However, two confounding variables may be operant.
First, because the U.S. data presented
here include both white and Black couples, it may be exaggerated compared
with white Canadian couples. Second,
data here is based on all marriages.
Since divorce has consistently been
higher in the United States than in Canada, part of the discrepancy may be due
to the differing proportions of remarriages. When only primary marriages in
the United States are considered, agediscrepant ones are observed to constitute only 3.3 per cent of the total, a
figure closer to the Canadian count.
Although data are not available for
nationwide comparisons, it may still be

marriages in 1977 in California are available courtesy of special tabulations by
Knupfer (1983). In some ways, British
Columbia may be considered more
comparable to California than the rest
of Canada. Although the divorce rate
there 1s not as high as in the United
States, it is consistently and significantly
higher than in the rest of Canada.! Comparisons of California in 1977 with British Columbia in 1979 suggest quite close
parallels in patterns of age-discrepant
marriages (Table 2). In California,
grooms ten or more years senior to their
brides were involved in 8.8 per cent of

Min 1980 in Canada, the national divorce rate
was 2.6 per 1,000. Historically, British Columbia
has always had the highest rates of any province,
reaching 3.6 per 1,000 that year. In the United
States, the rate for 1980 was markedly higher, 5.2
per 1,000. California does not have as high an incidence as some other states but its 1980 rate of 5.7
per 1,000 was considerably above the national average (U.S. Health, Education, and Welfare,
1982, p. 14).

all marriages, compared with 9.5 per
cent in British Columbia. At the other
end of the distribution, brides five or
more years senior to their grooms constituted 4.8 per cent of all brides in California and 4.5 per cent of all brides in
British Columbia. In both instances,
therefore, age-discrepant unions were
about one in seven of all marriages, a
proportion probably higher than national averages in either country
(Veevers, 1983a).

LONGITUDINAL TRENDS

The best data on longitudinal trends
would involve marriage statistics on a
single population over time, as for ex
= ample those available for British Co
lumbia since 1921 (Veevers, 1983a).
Since data of these kind are not widely
available, one alternative is to consider
data from the census. The Canadian
census does not publish detailed data on
age of husband by age of wife. In the
United States, however, such data are

1948 and have been available routinely
since 1960, as shown in Table 3. Although the grouping of the data does not
permit precise measures, the data do
suggest a slight convergence of age dif
‘ ferences and a slight increase in the pro
portion of marriages with the wife older
by at least two years.

Since only a few censuses have included data on age discrepancies, they
do not provide much scope for the analysis of long-term trends. However, a patient perusal of the family literature having anything to do with age did yield
some relevant studies. The earliest and
most comprehensive was the work of
Duncan (1934) on all marriages in.
Stillwater, Oklahoma from 1895 to
1932. Unfortunately for our purposes,
these data were not presented by year or
even decade of marriage. Bossard
(1933) examined all marriages which
took place in Philadelphia in 1932. In
the course of work on intermarriage and
divorce, Schmitt (1969) provided data
on Hawaii; similarly, in the course of

vided data on marriages in Salt Lake
City over fifty years beginning in 1927.
When such disparate works are collected and transmuted into a standard
format (in this case, the categories used
by Schmitt for his analysis of Hawaii),
some tentative conclusions are suggested (Table 4). Although such sporadic data are only suggestive, they do
_,Provide some indication of the variabilsity in the incidence of age-discrepant
‘‘marriages. For example, the May-° December situation of a man married to
®a bride ten or more years his junior was
Anot uncommon in British Columbia in
261921 (19.1 per cent) but is only half as
common there now (9.5 per cent). The
comarniage of a man to an older woman
occurred in only about one union in
‘gfourteen in early Stillwater, but occurs
.£oin nearly one union in four in contempo‘Orary Hawaii.
a Although intermittent data on
© groups only roughly comparable are not
=conclusive, the comparisons generated
© do lend some support to two earlier gen‘= eralizations. First, there has been a de— cline in both the absolute numbers of
5 husband-older marriages (from 85.6 per
© cent to 66.4 per cent) and in the propor& tions of those unions in which the hus= band was much older than his wife, sugA gesting an increasing preference for
marriages between persons of less disparate or even equal ages. Second, this
convergence is reflected in the incidence
of marriages in which the wife is slightly
older than her husband. The category of
1-4 years older ranges from only 6.0 per
cent to 16.1 per cent. However, little
change is observed in marriages in which
the wife is substantially older, even in
Hawaii where such atypical unions
would seem to be most common.

Age-Discrepant Marriages 25

IMPLICATIONS

Canada and the United States share a
multiplicity of common antecedents.
Although their cultures have evolved by
incorporating a potpourri of European
cultures, the major social institutions of
both countries reflect clearly the dominance of Anglo-Saxon traditions. Their
communality is further enhanced by the
persistence of Judeo-Christian precepts.
While there are observable differences
between Canada and the United States
in terms of various features of marriage
and of family life, and these differences
are worthy of note and of detailed study,
there are presumably more parallels between them than there are contrasts. It
is not a surprise, therefore, to find apparently similar definitions of the mores
and conventions of family life, including
age-grading norms in mate selection.

The next logical step in the examination of age-discrepant marriages is to extend comparisons beyond cross-national
issues to examine them in cross-cultural
contexts. Parallel situations might be expected to be found in other parts of the
developed Western world, where concomitant trends in marriage, fertility,
and divorce have been observed. In
other parts of the world, however, quite
different meanings may be attached to
husband-wife age differences, and subsequently different frequencies of occurrence and longitudinal trends might
be anticipated.

Husband-wife age differences are seldom subject to any important legal constraints and are generally free of religious stipulations or other connotations
of morality. Nevertheless, they generally seem to exhibit a remarkably consistent double standard in which

husband-older marriages are more acceptable and more common than comparable wife-older ones. It seems unlikely that accounting for the ubiquity of
this pattern required any amorphous assumptions about human nature,
Rather, it may simply reflect the extent
to which women, compared with men
have had unequal access to resources,
with a resulting diminishing of options
and of the will and the wherewithall of
self-determination. The result of these
factors, combined with others, has usually been that when confronted with the
costs and compensations—both intrinsic
and extrinsic—which are an inevitable
part of the mate selection process, the
bargaining power of women has been
markedly less than the bargaining power
of men. If these assumptions can be sustained, then patterns of age-discrepant
marriages might be considered an unob

trusive cross-cultural measure of the de
facto status of women in a given place
and time. Further research is therefore
needed to determine if distributions of
age-discrepant marriages do vary and, if
so, how such variation is concomitant
with other social indicators.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

This research was made possible, in part,
by a University of Victoria Faculty Research
Grant. Mr. Drhuva Nagnur of the Vital Statistics and Disease Registries Section of Statistics Canada provided special tabulations
of Canadian marriage statistics. I am grateful
to Dr. Genevieve Knupfer for providing access to special tabulations of Californian
marriage statistics, and to Dr. Philip Kunz
for making available data on marriages in
Utah. I am indebted to Ms. Kathy Chopik
for patient completion of tabulations of the
Canadian data, and to Ms. Linda Kritwschenko for her multifarious assistance with
this and other projects.
