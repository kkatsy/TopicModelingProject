An Examination of Factors
Influencing Black Fertility Decline
in the Mississippi Delta, 1880-1930

ABSTRACT: Although the fertility decline in the black population in the Mississippi Delta
between the late 1870’s and early 1930’s closely paralleled that of the national black population,
it rose much more dramatically in the 1940’s and 1950’s to almost 1880 levels. Given the
especially rural and oppressed conditions of blacks there, the initial decline seems puzzling.
Low fertility rates in the 1930's reflected a large proportion of childless females. Investigations
of changing contraceptive usage and mate exposure suggest both were minor components at
most. Several physiological impairments were investigated including dietary deficiences,
malaria, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted diseases (STD). Evidence suggests STD played
the major role, facilitated by nutritional and other health problems. Models relying heavily on
those developed by McFalls and McFalls (1984) suggest 50-80 percent of the decline could have
been due to the spread of STD. Age-specific birth rates for different periods and post-World
War-II fertility increases seem consistent with this finding.

The decline in the American black
total fertility rate (TFR) from around 7
in the 1870’s to under 3 in the 1930's
(Coale and Rives, 1973) has puzzled demographers because throughout the period blacks remained largely rural, impoverished, poorly educated, and in the
South. Farley (1970) argued that most of
the decline was involuntary, with the
spread of sexually transmitted diseases
(STD) being the main factor. McFalls
(1973) rebutted Farley’s arguments concerning the role of STD and presented a
model that purported to demonstrate
that STD could not have played the major role. He concluded (p. 18): “I believe that the black fertility trend was
probably fashioned by essentially the
same traditional factors that determined

213

its white counterpart, although health
factors undoubtedly played a more important role in the former.”

McFalls’ arguments were regarded as
devastating to the “VD hypothesis” by a
number of researchers investigating the
decline during the 1970’s (Meeker,
1977; Higgs, 1977; Engerman, 1978;
Lantz and Hendrix, 1978; Immerwahr,
1976). Excepting the work of McFalls
and coresearchers, only two studies appearing since 1973 explore the role of involuntary factors in the decline. Cutright and Shorter (1979) evaluated
Farley’s arguments, found those advanced for the influence of gonorrhea to
be the most persuasive, and suggested
that puerperal fever and rickets also
played key roles. Wright and Pirie

(1984) offered the only critical analysis
of McFalls’ arguments and concluded,
on the basis of a study correlating syphilis and child-woman ratios (CWRS) by
county in a six-state area in the South,
that the spread of STD was an important
component of the decline. Tolnay
(1985), however, argued that the Wright
and Pirie ‘“‘estimation technique commits the fundamental error of attnbuting causality to a correlation” (p. 3). In
his pioneering study of the age-specific
patterns of the fertility decline from
1885 to 1900, Tolnay (1981) observed
that the patterns of the rural population
did not appear to suggest a widespread
adoption of conscious fertility control.
More recently (1986), he argued that expanding educational opportunities
eventually penetrating into rural areas
were the main stimulus for the fertility
decline. While Farley and Allen (1987)
have again reiterated the ““VD hypothesis,” this view is decidedly a minority
one.

Perhaps ironically, the most important research that has been undertaken
on the role of involuntary factors in the
decline has involved McFalls, either singly (1979a, b; 1981) or in collaboration
(McFalls and Masnick, 1981; Masnick
and McFalls, 1978; McFalls and McFalls, 1984). The latter synthesizes impacts of infectious diseases on fertility,
addresses the importance of the spread
of genital tuberculosis in the black fertility decline, and presents models to measure its impact as well as that of STD.

This study examines the possible
roles that various voluntary and involuntary causes may have had in the black
fertility decline observed in the Delta
counties and parishes bordering the
Mississippi River: Concordia, Madison,
Tensas, and East Carroll parishes in
Louisiana; Issaquena, Coahoma, Wash
Social Biology

ington, Bolivar, and Tunica counties in
Mississippi; and Chicot, Desha, Phillips, Crittenden, and Mississippi counties in Arkansas. Given the CWRS existing in the area in 1880 and 1930, the
general fertility rate (GFR), or births
per 1,000 women aged 15-44, was estimated to have declined from 243 in
1875-79 to 98 in 1925-29 (Wright,
1986). In the latter period, the GFR was
only two-thirds of the southern black average when standardized for the proportions living in rural farm, rural nonfarm,
and urban areas. These changes suggest
a decline in the TFR from at least 7 to
about 3.

Corrected vital statistics data show a
bottoming out of the GFR to the low
90’s during the early 1930's (Figure 1).
By 1940 the rate was over 100 and in
1947 had risen 125. A rapid rise to over
200 by the mid 1950’s was maintained in
the latter part of the decade. Although
birth rates in both the national white and
nonwhite populations increased during
the “Baby Boom,” the increase in the
local black population was much more
dramatic. In contrast, the GFR in the local white population bottomed out at
107 in the late 1930’s, and the much
more modest post-war increase crested
in 1948 with birth rates declining thereafter. Among whites, the “Baby Boom”
was least marked in the South, and
southern white farmers were the one
group that did not participate in it
(Rindfuss and Sweet, 1977).

Given the overwhelmingly rural, impoverished, and poorly educated nature
of the area black population in the early
twentieth century and the changes after
World War II which resulted in increased urbanization, declining demand
for child labor, rising educational levels,
greater economic insecurity engendered
by mechanization, and the partial trans

Fic. 1.—Changes in the estimated white and black GFR’s in the study area and in the national white
and non-white GFR’s, 1925-60. Data are corrected for underregistration of births and estimated underenumeration of females, 15-44. Births for black and whites in the study area are assumed to be 65 and 75
per cent complete, respectively, in 1925~29. Linear improvements in registration are assumed between
1930-40 and 1940~50. Underenumeration of births is assumed to have been reduced by half between
1950-60, with linear improvement in the period. Sources: Coale and Zelnick, 1963; Coale and Rives,
1973; Grove, 1943; U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Vital Statistics, 1955; U.S. Bureau of the

formation of a sharecropping population to an agricultural laborer population, both the initial decline and later
rise seem puzzling. As general problems
confronting blacks in the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries were epitomized in the Delta, an understanding
of the chief causes of the fertility
changes there gives insight into those in
the national black population.

This study follows the recommendations of McFalls and Masnick (1981)
that any study of the black fertility decline must examine changes in birth control, mate exposure, and fecundity. A
brief overview of the area is presented
first. TFR and age-specific birth-rate

(ASBR) patterns for different periods
are then examined. The study then shifts
to a consideration of the three abovementioned considerations with special
attention given to pellagra, malaria,
genital tuberculosis (TB), and STD as
possible factors in the initial decline.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY AREA

The term “Mississippi Delta” generally refers to the study area plus the
bootheel area of Missouri and a number
of counties in Mississippi, i.e., Humphreys, Leflore, Quitman, Sharkey, and
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

Sunflower, that do not front the Mississippi River. The bootheel counties were
excluded from the study because of a
lack of data by race for many important
items.

Given the expenses of clearing the
land and flood control, the avoidance of
the area by white yeoman farmers because of malaria, and the superior qualities of the alluvial soil for growing cotton, the area was developed largely in
plantations worked first by slaves and
then by black sharecroppers. Prior to
1880 the population was entirely rural,
and as late as 1940 the census showed 77
per cent of all blacks living on farms with
the remainder equally in rural nonfarm
and urban areas. In 1960, nearly threeeights lived in urban areas with the remainder evenly divided between farm
and nonfarm areas.

Prior to the Depression, the modified
plantation system developed after the
Civil War remained intact with few modifications (Johnson, 1941). According
to the 1929 agricultural census, only 4
per cent of black farm operators owned
their land, while 67 per cent were sharecroppers, splitting the crop minus expenses with the landowner, often hopeJessly in debt, and regarded both in law
and practice as laborers paid by a share
of the crop. Plantation owners were
sources of both credit and authority,
usually paternalistically exercised
(Stone, 1908).

Cotton prices dropped from over 30¢
a pound in the late 1860’s to a low of 4.6¢
in 1894. Prices improved thereafter, but
the arrival of the boll weevil around
1910 caused lower crop yields, although
damage was much greater to the east of
the Delta. Prices jumped briefly to over
30¢ a pound at the end of World War I
and then slumped to 6¢ by 1932.
Changes in living conditions are difficult

Social Biology

to document, although they certainly
followed cotton prices at least to some
extent. Descriptions of living standards
in the 1870’s (Pickens, 1923; Painter,
1976) read depressingly like those of the
1930’s (Grubbs, 1976; Kestor, 1936;
Daniels, 1938). The common practice of
the landlords of declaring accounts even
at the end of the year, no matter what
the crop was (Cantor, 1969), kept living
conditions minimal.

Living conditions improved somewhat during the Depression with the
partial recovery of cotton prices as a
result of AAA policies, the requirement
that payments for land taken out of cotton production be shared with tenants
(although this provision was often ignored in practice), and the use of such
land to grow vegetables for home consumption (Powdermaker, 1937). Conditions greatly improved during World
War II as a result of high cotton prices
and military wages for individuals in the
service which far exceeded wages paid
on plantations. After the war, mechanization proceeded rapidly. By the mid
1950’s many workers had been forced
off the plantations, and most of the rest
were converted into agricultural laborers. Those displaced left the area or accumulated in the fetid slums of the local
settlements (Aiken and Demerath,
1968). The median black family income
computed from the 1960 census was
$1,383, compared to the U.S. nonwhite
median of $2,520 and the local white
median of $4,555.

This was not a population that would
seem likely to have reduced its TFR
from 7 to under 3 voluntarily prior to the
mid 1930’s. In order to evaluate the likelihood that voluntary fertility limitation
was largely responsible for the decline,
it is instructive to examine first agespecific fertility patterns.

TOTAL AND AGE-SPECIFIC PATTERNS OF
FERTILITY COMPARED

Prior to 1939-40, no county-level
data on the number of births by age of
mother were published. From the 1880
manuscript census of Concordia Parish,
a representative area, 1875-79 agespecific birth rates (ASBR’s) were estimated for the entire black farm population with the own-children method (see
Cho, 1973 for an explanation of the procedure), utilizing the Coale and Rives
(1973) estimates of undercounting by
age in 1880, assuming an expectation of
life at birth of 30 years for females, and
using the North model life tables (Level
a).

For 1939-40, the census bureau pub
lished the number of births by the fiveyear age group of the mother on the
county level (U.S. Bureau of the Census
1939-40). Births by race were adjusted
by the estimated undercount by country
(Grove, 1943), and the 1940 census totals of women in age groups 10-49 were
adjusted for estimated undercounts with
estimates for the national black population computed by Coale and Rives and
the national white population by Coale
and Zelnick (1963).

No detailed data are available for
1949-50, but the Mississippi State Department of Health generously provided
1959-60 births by age of mother on a
county level. Although tabulated data
by age were not available for the Louisiana and Arkansas areas, both 1960
CWR’s and 1960 data on overall births
indicate virtually identical fertility in the
study area outside of the Mississippi
counties. Completeness of birth enumeration for the Mississippi counties
was computed to be 94 and 98.8 per cent
for blacks and whites, respectively, in
1950 (U.S. Department of Health, Edu

cation, and Vital Statistics, 1955), with
improvements assumed to 97 and 100
per cent, respectively, by 1959-60.
Again, the numbers of women in ages
10-49 were adjusted for underenumeration, using the Coale and Rives and
Coale and Zelnick estimates. TFR’s
were estimated for urban, rural nonfarm, and farm populations from
CWR’s computed for each type of residence from the 1940 and 1960 censuses.
In 1939-40 the computed black TFR
was 2.99. This figure increased to 6.48
by 1959-60. Estimated rates were 1.8,
2.2, and 3.4, respectively, among urban,
rural nonfarm, and rural farm residents.
In the next twenty years, the TFR more
than tripled to 5.5 in urban and 6.8 in rural nonfarm areas, and the somewhat
smaller increase to 7.2 among farmers
resulted in fertility that had been characteristic of blacks around 1880. By 1960,
overall black fertility in the rural areas
was double that of whites, compared to
50 per cent greater in the urban areas. In
1939-40 it had been more than 10 per
cent lower for each type of residence.
In comparing ASBR’s, it would be
preferable to use marital rates. However, needed information by age is not
available from the 1940 or 1960 censuses. Given the prevalence of common
law marriage and “‘living together”’
among blacks in the Delta, and the fact
that a large proportion of initial conceptions occurred to unmarried females,!
the interpretation of marital ASBR’s
would be anything but straightforward.
Table 1 contains comparisons of nonwhite ASBR’s for Concordia County in

were in their first marriages, the oldest child on the
average was two months younger than the length

1875-79, and for residents outside of cities of populations of 10,000+ in the
study area in 1939-40, and in the Mississippi portion thereof in 1959-60.

Column 4, which contains the ratios
of 1939-40 ASBR’s to those existing before the fertility decline, shows a rapid
decline from 75 per cent in the 15-19 age
group to 48 per cent in the 20-24 age
group, with a progressive slowing to 40,
34, and 33 per cent in the next three fiveyear age groups. Sharp relative drops
thereafter are evident in the 40-44 and
45-49 age groups. Column 5, by contrast, reveals that 1959-60 ASBR’s up
to age 40 were similar to those of eighty
years earlier, but sharp progressive
drops are evident in the 40-44 and 4549 age groups.

Comparing nonwhite ASBR’s of
1939-40 and 1959-60 in cities of
10,000+ residents, the ASBR’s by age
group are as follows (with the 1939-40
figures given first): age 10-14, 12, and 6;
age 15-19, 115 and 172; age 20-24, 107
and 303; age 25-29, 52 and 273; age 3034, 36 and 166; age 35-39, 19 and 110;

age 40-44, 5 and 29; age 45-49, 0 and 1.
The overall TFR’s are 1.73 and 5.32.
The 1959-60 to 1939-40 ratios (expressed as percentages) rise from 50 in
the 10-14 age group to 150, 283, and 525
in the 15-19, 20-24, and 25-29 age
groups before levelling off.

In all periods, the teenage ASBR’s
indicate that coitus typically began early
without accompanying contraception.
Both the rural and urban 1939-40
ASBR’s, but especially the latter, suggest sterility most commonly occurred in
the late teens and early 20’s with a
greatly decreased and declining number
of new sterility victims thereafter. Relative drops in the 40+ groups are more
suggestive of birth control, perhaps by
high-parity females with unimpaired fecundity. In the urban population,
ASBR’s become so low in the older age
groups that it is difficult to attribute
them entirely to fecundity impairments.
In the 1959-60 rural population, by contrast, there is little evidence of birth control or fecundity impairment up to age
40. In the 40+ age group, however,

Vol. 36, No. 3~4

there was apparently either a considerable use of contraception, a high rate of
sterility, or a combination of both. The
1959-60 urban ASBR’s suggest a somewhat later fertility start than in the rural
area, but otherwise similar ASBR’s to
age 30. Relative drops thereafter do suggest increasing use of birth control, but
increasing fecundity impairments with
age cannot be ruled out.

Comparison of ASBR’s of 1939-40
and 1959-60 by race (not shown) reveal
contrasting patterns, in that white fertility in the 15-19 age group, when controlled for residence, was typically less
than half that for blacks, peaked sharply
in the 20-24 age group, and declined
substantially thereafter, especially between the 25-29 and 30-34 age groups.
For whites, the patterns suggest marriage typically between ages 18~22 and
increasing use of birth control after several years of marriage and attainment of
the desired number of children.

In summary, patterns of change in
the TFR in the white and black populations differed markedly, suggesting different forces at work. Concerning the
black population, apparently the entire
period from the 1870’s to 1960 was
marked by sexual relations often beginning at puberty and many teen births.
However, given the fact that most girls
in 1939-40 were probably not highly fecund before age 16, 1939-40 ASBR’s
suggest that fertility peaked by age 21,
or even earlier, and then began to decline rapidly. In contrast, fertility patterns up to age 40 in the countryside by
1959-60 appear to have been similar to
those in the countryside eighty years
earlier. Patterns noted for the larger urban areas are more suggestive of voluntary fertility control in both periods, but
with a strong involuntary component in

the former. With this background, the
documentary evidence on voluntary fertility control in the former period can be
investigated.

Was CONTRACEPTION EXTENSIVELY
USED?

During the New Deal, the Delta was
the object of a number of sociological
studies. None, even those noting relatively small families, made any mention
of contraception. Cohn (1935, p. 85)
bluntly asserted: “The use of contraceptives among the Delta Negroes is almost
unknown although in the towns there is
some knowledge of contraceptive devices. ... The majority of Negroes
here see no need for contraceptives.” A
study of a number of white sharecropping families in the 1930’s revealed little
interest in and apparently little practice
of contraception (Dobb, 1937). Given
the lower educational levels, lesser
chances for upward mobility, and paternalistic attitudes of plantation owners
toward them, poor blacks would seem
to have been even less likely candidates
to practice birth control extensively.
The local white view (Stone, 1908; Alexander, 1945; Cohn, 1935; Percy, 1941)
of black sharecroppers as being
“present” oriented and not planning for
the future was not contradicted by sociological studies (see especially Dollard,
1937, and Powdermaker, 1937), although the latter ascribed institutional
rather than racial reasons.

Neither the Dollard nor the Powdermaker study of the same small town in
the Delta mention the use of birth control among blacks, but their descriptions
of “respectable blacks” (for whom education was stressed and aspirations for
children were high) do seem to suggest
that contraception could have been

practiced in this group. Although no
studies of the urban blacks mention induced abortion, it is known that blacks
in northern cities often resorted to this
option (see especially Lane, 1986).
Given the expense of raising children
and a high proportion of adult black females without spouses in the Delta
towns, it is conceivable that abortion
was Often resorted to.

Concerning the farm population,
studies addressing the value of children
prior to World War II (see, especially,
Powdermaker, 1937) agree on the following points: (1) children were an economic asset because they could work in
the cotton fields and the size of a sharecropping plot was based on the number
of working “hands”; (2) schooling did
not hinder working in the fields as blacks
were expected to attend school only
when there was no work to be done; and
(3) large families were desired and orphans were eagerly adopted, especially
by families with no children. In such circumstances, induced abortions were
probably rare, given the fact that even if
a child-to-be was not wanted by a
woman, a transfer could easily be arranged with relatives or others. These
values were hardly congruent with fertility levels observed in the 1930’s.

It is difficult to isolate social or economic trends that might account for a
rising use of fertility control prior to the
1930’s or a declining use thereafter.
Census data portray a consistent and
steady fertility decline during the 18801930 period, notwithstanding tremendous fluctuations in cotton prices. Even
in the 1930’s, educational levels were
lower in the Delta than any other area
save the “Cajun” area of Louisiana. An
analysis of CWR’s in the late nineteenth
century to 1910 showed them to be lowest in the Louisiana portion of the Delta,

Social Biology

notwithstanding the worst educational
levels there (Wright, 1986). Apparently
educational levels began to improve
markedly in the 1930’s (Dollard, 1937).
In 1950, a milestone of sorts was
achieved in Coahoma County when police checked trucks to prevent children
under age 15 from working in the fields
(Jones and McLauren, 1951). Although
child-labor laws were often ignored
even in the 1960’s (Dunbar, 1969), edu- cational opportunities were increasing
at the same time the birth rate rose.

The fertility increase does not appear
to have been related to economic factors. Economic conditions greatly improved during and immediately after
World War I, but thereafter considerable stress and economic hardship resulted from mechanization which in the
early stages reduced the need for the
“male” labor of plowing and later, with
the adoption of the cotton harvester,
made most other manual labor redundant as well.

In summary, available contemporary
evidence does not suggest that birth rate
fluctuations reflected changing use of
contraception, although a caveat must
be added that contemporary studies
everywhere in the South underestimated the use of bifth control given the
taboos that inhibited frank discussion of
the subject. Prior to World War I, birth
control was almost certainly practiced to
some extent, especially in the towns.

MATE EXPOSURE

Pre—World-War-II studies (see especially Powdermaker, 1937; Dollard,
1937; and Cohn, 1935) agree that in at
least the sharecropping population marital ties were loose, with common-law
marriage the norm and considerable
changing of partners. However, this instability does not appear to have re

sulted in greatly reduced exposure to
sexual relations. Cohn (1935, p. 87) observed: “Sexual relations among the
Delta Negro begin at a tender age... .
and last as long as strength allows. A girl
at the age of twenty is sexually an experienced woman of the world.” Other presumably less biased researchers also
suggested that sexual relations typically
began shortly after puberty, marriages
tended to be unstable, and separations
were not typically accompanied by sexual abstinence. Johnson’s survey (1941)
of six rural counties including Coahoma
and Bolivar indicated that sexual encounters for both males and females typically began at age 14. He asserted that
for the “folk Negro,” which he felt to be
dominant in the Delta, “sex is not, apparently, an acute problem” (p. 225).
Dollard (1937) argued that the large degree of sexual freedom and indulgence
in large part compensated the lowerclass blacks for their subservient position vis-a-vis the whites.

The possibility that there was a shortage of mates for females in the reproductive age groups must be considered.
One approach for estimating the availability of potential mates for females in
the reproductive ages is to add the numbers of males 15-44 and 20—49, divide
by two, and then divide the dividend by
the number of females 15-44. This averaging reflects the fact that males tend to
choose somewhat younger mates. In the
study area, the number of “eligible
males’ per 100 females in 1930, 1940,
1950, and 1960 was computed to be 86,
86, 79, and 74, respectively, compared
to comparable national averages of 86,
85, 87, and 86 (computed from U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1930a, 1940, 1950,
1960). However, computed rates for

tively. Therefore, the ratio of eligible
males to females actually declined during the period from 1940-60 with the
pre-World-War-II mate shortage concentrated in urban areas.

An indicated low sex ratio could
reflect a large number of males unattached to larger families and therefore
likely to be missed in censuses. Johnson
noted that over 20 per cent of the farm
households in Coahoma and Bolivar
counties were headed by females, compared to much lower proportions in
nonplantation areas. Ironically, the

plantation system did favor families con
taining at least two adults with one being
a male, since sharecropping was labor
intensive. Two censuses of the Delta
and Pine Land (D&PL or “Scott’’) Plantation in Bolivar County, the largest
plantation in the world, show the proportion of sharecropping families
headed by females to have increased
from 11 per cent in 1925 to 33 per cent in
1951, notwithstanding a doubling of the
CWR from 353 to 760. On the latter
date, most plowing was performed by
tractors (D&PL Plantation, 1925,
1951).

In 1930, 66 per cent of black females
aged 14+ in the study area were married, compared to 59 per cent in the national black population (computed from
U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1935). In
contrast, the more detailed 1960 census
tabulation showed the proportions married to be 59 and 62 per cent, respectively, and more significantly, the proportions married with spouse present to
be 49 and 54 per cent, respectively (computed from U.S. Bureau of the Census,
1960). Indeed, the proportions “‘separated from spouse” and ‘‘widowed”’
were much higher than those of surrounding non-Deita rural counties. As a
result, only 63 per cent of children under

222 Wright

18, compared with 67 per cent in the national black population, resided with
both parents. Hence, the low indicated
sex ratio by 1960 may in part reflect
greater family abandonment by males.
Indeed, Dunbar’s (1969) description of
a stranded population in a plantation
area suggests a low sex ratio due both to
an exodus of males between ages 18 and
25 and family abandonment. In this
community there was an average of five
children per family, despite the low sex
ratio.

In short, the mate exposure argument for the relatively low fertility just
prior to World War II loses credibility
with the apparent increase in instability
during the period of the rapid fertility
rise. Hence, involuntary impediments
to fecundity must be considered. Data
on family size and pregnancy complications as they relate to this issue are presented below. A discussion on the actual
impediments follows.

STERILITY AND PREGNANCY
COMPLICATIONS

Farley (1970) observed that black cohorts spending most of their childbearing years just prior to World War II
were characterized by much higher proportions who were childless and at high
parities (i.e., had many births) than
their white counterparts. He argued that
this combination reflected high rates of
involuntary childlessness combined with
low rates of contraception. Cutright and
Shorter (1979) performed a parity progression analysis and determined that 67
per cent of the fertility decline evident in
the 1907 as compared to the 1868 black
female cohort was due to the increase in
the proportion from 27 to 56 per cent
with fewer than two births and that the
increase thereafter in the completed fer
Social Biology

tility in the 1934 cohort was entirely due
to the decline in the proportion having
fewer than two births.

Published census information does
not permit a parity progression analysis
here, but 1930 data on families does permit inferences concerning childlessness.
Whereas the mean family sizes of the
national black populations in urban, rural nonfarm, and farm areas were 3.91,
4.06, and 4.78, respectively, they were
3.12, 2.98, and 3.64, respectively, in the
study area (computed from U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1930a). Computed
median family sizes of 2.32, 2.18, and
2.99, respectively, in the study area
(ibid.) suggest a much higher proportion
of two- and three-person families in the
study area than in the nation. However,
family size is affected by other factors as
well as by the number of children living
with parents.

More information on this issue is provided by a 1935-36 U.S.D.A. survey of
black (and white) farm families in the
Delta, eastern North Carolina, east central South Carolina, and central Georgia. Only families comprised of both
husband and wife who had been married
and lived on the same farm for at least a
year were included. Nearly 10 per cent
in both the Delta and Georgia, but under 4 per cent in the other two areas,
were excluded as being one-person
households. An undetermined, but
probably sizable, number thus excluded
were females in reproductive ages without children. An additional 10 per cent
of families in all areas were excluded, although containing more than one family
member, because a spouse was missing.
Data in Table 2 pertain to the eligible
families.

lies in the Delta as compared to the Carolina families. Georgia families occupy
an intermediate position, although the
lower median age of the Delta wives
should have favored the presence of
children. Although the earliermentioned procedure of Cutright and
Shorter (1979) measured the impact of
zero- and one-parity females on changes
in completed fertility over time, it can
also be used to measure the contribution
of childless and single-child families in
accounting for the difference in the average number of children in the Delta
and the South Carolina (the most prolific) samples. It shows that 69 per cent
of the difference was due to the greater
prevalence of families with fewer than
two children in the Delta, with the bulk
due to childless families.

Given the exclusion from the sample
of persons living alone, the common
practice of young relatives and orphans
living with childless couples, and the fact
that perhaps a tenth of babies born in
the Delta died before age 16, the 193536 survey suggests that perhaps onethird of Delta farm females living most
of their reproductive years in the 1920’s
and 1930’s were nulliparous and that

3.94 424 4.04

perhaps one-sixth had only one birth.
Given the strong desire for children
among farm families, this situation is
certainly suggestive of widespread infecundity. Earlier cited census data on
family size suggest much higher rates of
childlessness in nonfarm areas.
Malnutrition, general poor health,
and diseases, notably syphilis and malaria, may induce spontaneous fetal loss
(SFL). Cutright (1975) estimated the
nonwhite rates to be 914 (per 1,000
births) in 1940 and 460 in 1960. From
these rates he calculated that if the 1960
SFL rates had existed in 1940, black
marital fertility then would have been 11
per cent higher than in 1960, rather than
24 per cent lower. This argument, however, is flawed in that in the absence of
contraception, the interval between two
pregnancies when the first ends in SFLis
much shorter than when the first results
in a live birth. Keyfitz (1971) made a
rough calculation that intervals between
pregnancies ending in induced abortions
were only 36 per cent of those ending in
live births. Given the somewhat longer
durations for typical pregnancies ending
in SFL, 40 per cent may be a reasonable
figure for pregnancies terminated by

224 Wright

SFL. Ina “perfect contraceptive” population in which all pregnancies are desired, SFL will typically result in an additional pregnancy that otherwise would
not have occurred, subject, of course, to
the “biological time clock.” Hence, although SFL does affect the birth rate, its
impact is considerably less than suggested by crude figures on pregnancy
wastage.

Vital statistics data on SFL are poor
in that only pregnancies lasting more
than twenty weeks are counted and,
prior to the advent of governmentsponsored prenatal care which began in
the Delta only in the 1930’s as part of the
syphilis control program, only a low proportion of miscarriages were likely to be
reported to authorities. Hence, Delta
rates, especially for 1930, contained in
Table 3 are probably understated even
in relation to the national black population.

Table 3 reveals higher-than-average
rates in rural areas in 1930 and 1940 that,
however, are well below those of Florida (10.9 in rural areas in 1930), which
was characterized both by high rates of
syphilis (Wright and Pirie, 1984) and
better reporting than the study area.
Powdermaker, (1937), however, characterized fetal wastage as “‘extraordinarily high” (p. 57). The apparent jump
in fetal deaths in the cities between 1930
and 1940 plausibly reflects both higher
true rates (syphilis and tuberculosis
were known to be most prevalent in cities) and the establishment of prenatal

_ Clinics in which fetal problems could be

noted (although the true rate would be
declining as a result). In both the nation
as a whole and the study area, the recorded fetal death rate began to decline
after 1930. In contrast to the nation as a
whole, the noncity rate actually increased between 1950 and 1960, possi
Social Biology

bly reflecting the cessation of prenatal
services associated with STD clinics
which were shut down in the early 1950’s
when the STD problem seemed under
control (Smith, 1954).

It appears that SFL had much less of
an impact on fertility than did sterility,
although the higher-than-average recorded rate was indicative of health
problems affecting fertility in other ways
as well. Reflecting this modest impact
was a noncity TFR of nearly 7 in 195960, notwithstanding a fetal loss rate well
above the national average. This figure
does not suggest that fetal losses in 1960
had a marked overall impact on fertility.

Cutright and Shorter (1979) argued
that puerperal fewer reduced black fertility in the early twentieth century, but
information concerning its impact on
subsequent fecundity is lacking. National vital statistics data available on
deaths (only a proxy for the relative incidence) beginning in 1915 show high
rates among nonwhite females until a
marked drop began about 1930, resulting in a decline from 40.8 (per 10,000
births) to 3.5 by 1960 (computed from
U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1930b,
1960). Although the area rate was somewhat higher than the U.S. average (and,
in contrast to fetal deaths, probably
fairly accurately counted), the impact of
puerperal fever on fertility prior to
World War II is nonetheless problematic. Typical conditions of childbirth in
the 1930’s, on a farm attended by a midwife without special training, appear to
have been similar to those existing in the
1870’s. Also, in rural areas in the 1930's,
there was probably a low rate of induced
abortions, a frequent cause of puerperal
fever when performed under unsanitary
conditions.

In summary, indicators of sterility,
fetal wastage, and puerperal fever all

suggest worse than average health conditions in the study area. However, sterility appears to have had a far greater
impact on fertility than the other two.

POSSIBLE FECUNDITY IMPAIRMENTS

McFalls (1979a) discussed a number
of “psychopathologies” that could negatively affect fertility, including psychic
stress, psychosis, sexual deviations, alcoholism, and also cigarette smoking
and drug abuse. In a related study
(1979b) he stated that psychopathological disorders such as psychic stress and
alcoholism were underrated causes of
the black fertility decline.

Contemporary literature on the
Delta does not directly address these issues, although it is clear that the blacks’
subordinate position to whites caused
considerable stress and that alcoholism
was a social problem among males. Earlier discussed accounts by Powdermaker
(1937), Dollard (1937), Cohn (1935),
and Johnson (1941) are unanimous in
assuming that at least among the mass of
rural blacks, such stresses did not interfere with sexual practice.

Only the roles of nutritional and infectious diseases remain to be explored.
Concerning the general health of the

sharecroppers, one relief worker in the
great 1927 Mississippi River flood (cited
by Daniel, 1977, p. 27) described then as
“a people worn out by the ravages of tuberculosis, pellagra and venereal diseases with little resistance due to unsanitary working conditions.” Even in the
1960’s, Dunbar (1969, p. 49) characterized the health of the Delta population
as “incredibly poor” with rampant sickness, wasting diseases, and chronic iliness. Possible fecundity impairments
that were known or believed to be common in the Delta prior to World War I
were pellagra, rickets, malaria, TB, and
STD. Fecundity-impairing effects of
each will be considered in turn.
Pellagra.—Prior to the Depression,
local landlords discouraged home vegetable plots because the land was so valuable for growing cotton, home-grown
products would reduce the demand for
goods from plantation-owned commissary stores, and pests from gardens were
considered to be threats to cotton fields.
Not surprisingly, a survey completed
just before the 1927 flood (Dickens,
1928) revealed a typical black farmer’s
diet was adequate in caloric intake but
seriously deficient in calcium, protein,
phosphorus, and iron. These were ideal
conditions for pellagra to flourish.

226 Wright

Farley specifically identified pellagra
as perhaps the second leading cause (after STD) of the fertility decline, although medical evidence does not suggest that it directly causes sterility.
McFalls observed (1979b) that pellagra
could indirectly reduce fertility through
increasing susceptibility to STD, causing irregular menstruation and amenorrhea, and complicating pregnancies.
Livi-Bacci (1986) believed that pellagra,
by affecting stress, libido, and the frequency of sexual intercourse, caused a
crude birth rate decline from about 40
(per thousand persons) to around 35 in
the Italian province of Veneto in the late
nineteenth century.

Pellagra was first noted as a medical
problem following the 1913 flood
(Etheridge, 1972) and again reached crisis proportions following the 1927 flood.
Health statistics for Mississippi suggest
an incidence rate of just under 2 per cent
in the Delta in 1930 (Odum, 1936). This
rate is similar to that recorded for
Veneto in the period of lowest fertility in
the nineteenth century (Livi-Bacci,
1986), but is probably grossly underestimated. Records from the Scott Plantation showed an average of 356 cases a
year out of a population of approximately 3,000 during the late 1920’s and
early 1930’s (Nelson, 1984). Given the
paternalism on this plantation, the true
rate in the general farm population was
probably higher, perhaps reaching 20
per cent of the adult black population.
Diets were more varied in the urban areas (Dickens, 1928), and the population
there was apparently less affected.

Pellagra was controlled medically
during the 1930’s through the mass distribution of yeast to vulnerable populations. In addition, the Depression and
the resultant AAA encouraged the
growing of home vegetables because

Social Biology

plantation owners wanted the tenants to
bear a greater responsibility for feeding
themselves and land taken out of cotton
production as a result of acreage restrictions could be used for gardens without
penalty (Powdermaker, 1937). By 1937,
pellagra ceased to be a medical problem
in the Delta (Etheridge, 1972).

Although the eradication of pellagra
and improvement of the diet in the
1930’s were associated with an increase
in the birth rate, it is notable that the
bulk of the increase occurred after
World War II. It is plausible that pellagra did act to reduce fecundity mainly
through increasing susceptibility to
other fecundity-reducing diseases, notably STD.

Rickets.—The possible influence of
rickets is considered here because Cutright and Shorter (1979) identified it as
a prime cause of the national black fertility decline via complicating childbirth.
Although the average intake of calcium
as recorded by the Delta nutritional
study was only 77 per cent of the recommended standard (Dickens, 1928), accounts of health conditions in the Delta
are notable for the absence of any mention of rickets. Further, it is unlikely that
the incidence of rickets increased substantially in the countryside between the
1879’s and 1930's, although the increasing numbers living in crowded conditions in the towns could have resulted in
an increase in the incidence there. It
does not appear that rickets was a significant cause in the fertility decline.

Malaria.—In contrast to rickets, malaria was continually mentioned as a severe problem by contemporary writers.
Both Cohn (1935) and Smith (1954) assert that in the 1890’s, at least among the
white population, virtually everyone
suffered from attacks during the malaria
season which lasted from May to Octo

Vol. 36, No. 3-4

ber. One of the two dominant culprits
was plasmodium falciparum (the other
being p. vivax), which McFalls and McFalls note depresses the birth rate by inducing temporary sterility in males and
miscarriages in females.

A serious hindrance to attributing the
fall of fertility to malaria is that malaria
was rife from the time settlement began,
with substantial progress against it starting with the extensive draining of
swamps in the 1890’s and culminating
with a seven-year malaria control program starting in the Delta in 1935 that
virtually eradicated the scourge (Smith,
1954). In Bolivar County, the annual incidence was estimated have declined
from 70 per cent in 1910 to 50 per cent in
1920 and to only 16 per cent in 1930
(Mississippi State Board of Health,
1931). Thus, progress ran counter to the
fertility decline. Another discrepancy
lies in the fact that blacks, especially
those with the genetic sickling trait,
were more resistant to malaria than
whites. Despite malaria, the 1925-29
GFR of whites was computed to be a
fifth higher than that for blacks in the
study area (Figure 1).

In an area of Belize characterized by
an extreme frequency of malaria attacks, Fischein (1961) found completed
fertility of the females with the sickling
trait to be 7.04, compared to 4.89 for the
remaining three-quarters lacking this
trait. Equally significant was the fact
that 52 per cent of the births of the
former, but only 42 per cent of the latter, were male, reflecting the fact that
most miscarriages occurring in the
group lacking the sickling trait involved
male fetuses. To the extent that malaria
reduced fertility through miscarriages in
the Delta, this process should have been
reflected in a much lower sex ratio
(males per 100 females at birth) than in

Black Fertility Decline

 

227

the general black population. In fact,
the sex ratios of black children under
ages one and five in the study area were
almost identical to, but usually somewhat higher than, the national black average in 1880, 1930, 1940, 1950, and
1960 (computed from U.S. Bureau of
the Census, 1880, 1886, 1930, 1940,
1950, and 1960; data for intervening
years not available for study area). As
earlier noted, there was not a particularly high official fetal death rate prior to
World War II; the earliest available data
for the Mississippi portion in 1922 show
a rate of 8.3 per 100 births (U.S. Bureau
of the Census, 1922).

In summary, evidence that the fertility decline was caused by malaria is lacking, although it might once have had a
mild effect. Blood tests in two Delta
counties in 1927-28 suggested that attacks caused by p. vivax outnumbered
those of p. falciparum by three to one
(Carley and Balfour, 1929). To the extent this ratio was valid for all areas in all
periods, most persons suffered from the
milder variety of malaria. If a strong
case cannot be made that malaria significantly depressed nineteenth century
fertility in the Delta, one can assume it
had no more than a mild impact on fertility anywhere in the United States.

Genital tuberculosis.—It was McFalls
(1981) who first stressed the possible importance of the spread of genital TB in
the black fertility decline. After emancipation, the much greater movement
combined with poor dietary conditions,
and lack of genetic immunity resulted in
the rapid spread of TB among blacks.
Infections among blacks were much
more likely to spread from the lungs and
become miliary (general) in nature. If
tuberculosis spreads to the genital areas,
sterility may result.

“high’’, “realistic,” and “low” models
that accounted for 21.1, 15.0, and 8.9
per cent, respectively, of the national
black fertility decline. These models are
highly conjectural in that no firm evidence exists on the past incidence of
genital TB.

Table 4, showing 1939-41 mortality
from TB in the national and study-area
populations, must be interpreted with
caution because deaths are only a proxy
for its relative incidence. Nonetheless,
differences between the area and the nation among blacks are striking as is the
lack of difference by residence in the
study area. Therefore, the comparatively low fertility around 1935 does not
appear to have been due to particularly
high rates of tuberculosis in either the
rural or urban areas. However, given
the particularly deplorable living conditions, it is likely that a higher proportion
of tuberculosis infections caused sterility
than elsewhere.

Sexually transmitted diseases.—All
contemporary authors addressing STD
in the early twentieth century in the
Delta agreed that the rate of STD
among blacks was extremely high, with
Cohn (1935) claiming that doctors, plantation managers, and other knowledgeable whites estimated an 80 per cent incidence rate. Mass blood testing of

Delta populations in the 1930’s consistently revealed syphilis rates around 30
per cent (Mississippi State Board of
Health, 1931-39), but the published
figures did not contain breakdowns by
race, sex, or age. It was the mass serologic testing of all males eligible for recruitment in World War II that quantified the extent of the syphilis problem
both in the Delta and general populations.

Published results for the first 1.7 million recruits examined showed rates of
25.2 and 1.7 per cent in the national
black and white populations, respectively (Vondelehr and Usilton, 1942).
Results were published on the county
level and for urban areas for the first 2.1
million recruits examined (U.S. Public
Health Services, 1942 and 1943), but
were not broken down by race. The estimation procedure described in Wright
and Pirie (1984) produced an estimated
rate of 36 per cent for blacks in the study
area. In urban areas, an incidence rate
of 49 per cent was estimated, compared
to 34 per cent in rural areas.

Based on the fact that the examination of the first two million recruits suggest that 36 per cent of black males aged
31-35 had positive reactions, an overall
rate of 36 per cent in the sample suggest
that perhaps half of all black males in the

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

Vol. 36, No. 3-4

Delta acquired syphilis during their reproductive lifetimes. Rosenwald testing
for syphilis in six southern counties (including Bolivar) during the 1930’s and
published results of mass testing undertaken during “anti-VD” campaigns immediately after World War II (see
Wright and Pirie, 1984, for a detailed
listing) consistently showed similar rates
among black males and females. One
can assume that probably half of the
black females aged 31~35 in the area
also suffered from syphilis infections.
Gonorrhea is highly associated with
syphilis because the modes of transmission are the same. Given the shorter incubation period and lack of immunity to
subsequent infections, gonorrhea was
much more common than syphilis. Data
from the U.S. military between the
world wars suggest a ratio of four cases
of gonorrhea to one case of syphilis. The
Navy Surgeon General, noting much
higher ratios among personnel under
age 25, believed the ratio to be higher
(Office of the Surgeon General, 1925).
If this ratio reflected conditions in the

Delta, one can estimate that there was a

cumulative incidence of 200 per cent
among blacks reaching the age of 35. Of
course, many were never infected, but
others were infected many times.

As in the case of TB, the much
greater mobility following emancipation
allowed STD to spread. Given the extreme mobility characteristic of the
black tenant and sharecropping population of the area (Hitt, 1943; Dollard,
1937) and the loose marital ties previously discussed, it is hardly surprising
that by 1941 the Delta stood out as a
high incidence area.

cause sterility by blocking the epidymitis
in the male (epididymitis) and the fallopian tubes in the female (pelvic inflammatory disease or PID). In this century,
chlamydia trachomatis has been recognized as a separate STD with generally
mild symptoms, but with the same
sterility-producing effects as gonorrhea.
Itis now considered to be more common
than gonorrhea, infecting three million
Americans each year (Sweet and Gibbs,
1985). Its prevalence in the Delta, or indeed anywhere in the United States
prior to World War IT is unknown.

McFalls’ original model (1973), developed to estimate the role of STD on
the national black fertility decline, contained a number of erroneous assumptions (Wright and Pirie, 1984). This fact
was implicitly recognized in the revised
model presented in McFalls and McFalls (1984), which will hereafter be labeled the MF Model. This model (actually three in that “high,” “moderate,”
and “low” estimates were generated) is
much improved as it is based on extensive research. As such, it deserves serious scrutiny in suggesting to what extent
the low fertility in the Delta in the 1930’s
could have been due to the spread of
STD.

McFalls and McFalls (1984) assume
that in 1880 the incidence of syphilis and
gonorrhea was 2-4 per cent with a 4:1
ratio of new gonorrhea to syphilis infections. This assumption is unverifiable,
but does not seem to be unrealistic.
They assume that since the World War
II serologic tests showed that 35.7
(which they cited as 35) per cent of black
males aged 31-35 tested positive, the
true incidence could not have exceeded
30 per cent because those examined
were not a random sample of the general population. In the case of the Delta,
few blacks could earn deferments for oc

cupational reasons and, as the Scott
Plantation president noted, joining the
military was an attractive option for
heads of families because the benefits
based on the number of dependents
were more generous than those available from sharecropping (Kirby, 1987).
An analysis of the World War II serologic tests showed that among blacks (although not whites) there were no differences by occupation or marital status
that were statistically significant when
age was controlled for (Usilton et al.,
1945). These findings were replicated in
the mass testing of blacks in Savanna at
the conclusion of the war (Bowdoin et
al., 1949). Therefore, it seems that the
figure derived from the tests is roughly
applicable to the entire black male population.

McFalls and McFalls (1984) argue on
the basis of 1962 national prevalence
data that if the male incidence rate for
syphilis was 30 per cent, it was only 21.4
per cent for females. On the basis of evidence earlier presented, it is invalid to
assume any difference existed by gender
prior to the late 1940's.

They extrapolate the estimates for
the total incidence of gonorrhea by assuming it was four times as prevalent as
syphilis among both males and females.
Although earlier mentioned military
data support this assumption, it may be
inaccurate for two reasons: (1) There is
no medical evidence that there is a gender differential in the probability of acquiring syphilis from a single exposure,
but it is clear that in the case of gonorrhea females are much more vulnerable;
and (2) the literature on syphilis does
not suggest a differential susceptibility
by race, but this is not true for gonorrhea.

On the former point, one estimate is
that the probabilities of contracting gon
Social Biology

orrhea from a single heterosexual encounter with an infected partner are 2030 and 50 per cent for a male and
female, respectively (Zinner, 1985).
Another estimate gives the probabilities
as 20-25 and 80-90 per cent, respectively (Sweet and Gibbs, 1985). Concerning the latter point, one study cited
by Berg (1985) found that the gonorrhea
rate in black males was twice that for
whites even after correcting for the
number of exposures and partners. Another study cited by Berg (1985) suggested this differential did not exist for
other types of STD. It appears that persons with blood type B are especially
susceptible to gonorrhea, and blacks are
much more likely than whites to have
this blood type. For these reasons, using
a 4:1 ratio for estimating gonorrhea
rates seems too conservative, especially
for females.

McFalls and McFalls (1984) argue
that on the national level only half of the
black population was ever “at risk.”
While this estimate cannot be evaluated
here, it is clear from earlier cited studies
that a much higher proportion in the
Delta was at risk. .

Their estimate that a fifth of male
gonorrhea cases were complicated by
epididymitis and that sterility resulted a
third of the time seems reasonable. Although their estimate that 20 per cent of
female infections developed into PID,
with sterility resulting 70 per cent of the
time, also seems reasonable for the general population before antibiotics, a
number of studies (see especially
Holmes et al., 1980) have shown that
black females are especially vulnerable
to having a given infection develop into
PID. Whether this was true prior to
World War II is unknown; but given the
poor health conditions and nutrition of
blacks in the rural South, it would ap

pear to be likely. At least part of the
contemporary difference appears to be
the relatively greater incidence of a
strain of gonococcus among whites that
is less likely to cause PID (Handsfield,
1984). This strain, which is relatively resistant to penicillin, has apparently
flourished since 1945.

McFalls and McFalls (1984) assert
that the average female in an uncontrolled fertility situation would have averaged at least two children prior to
gonorrhea-induced sterility. The assumption was relaxed to 1.5 children in
the “high” model. The average is based
on the assumption that coitus typically
began at age 18, the initial syphilis and
presumably gonorrhea infection developed at age 22.3 years, and sterility typically developed about 66 months after
initial coitus.

Earlier presented evidence suggests
that an estimate of a median age of 14—
15 for the initiation of coitus is more realistic for the Delta. Presumably, the average age of initial infection was 18-19
years. That this assumption is not out of
the realm of possibility is shown by a survey of 412 males (406 of whom were
black) in Delaware being treated for
syphilis. Questioning and examination
revealed that 374 had suffered from at
least one previous attack of gonorrhea
and that the average age at first infection
was 19 years (Cameron and Chapman,
1944),

Westrom (1980) found that in Sweden the risk of developing PID for sexually active girls age 15 during a one-year
period was one in eight, dropping to one
in 10 for girls age 16, and dropping rapidly thereafter to one in 80 for sexually
active females age 24. Much of this difference reflects the high incidence of
promiscuity in the younger groups. Fifty
per cent of 15-year-olds reported four or

 

Black Fertility Decline . 231

more sexual partners compared to 20
per cent of women aged 18 (Westrom,
1980). However, it also appears that
both the chances of contracting gonorrhea from an infected partner and of
PID developing from such infections are
much greater in early adolescence than
later, possibly because the cervix is
shorter (Bell and Hein, 1984). Hence, a figure of one birth before sterility seems
more plausible for the Delta, although a
high proportion of females would have
been nulliparous and some would have
had multiple births before the onset of
sterility.

McFalls and McFalls (1984) assume
that gonorrhea and syphilis victims were
largely the same. The previously mentioned Delaware study supports this
contention. McFalls and McFalls also
assume that the probability of suffering
from a subsequent infection of gonorrhea was a direct function of acquiring a
previous infection and that no one suffered more than ten attacks. The Delaware study indicated that 70 per cent
suffering from an initial infection were
subsequently reinfected.

The MF model assumes that syphilis
in females causes the cessation of live
births for two years with no cessation of
births thereafter. Medical evidence is
that the chances of transmitting syphilis
to the fetus does decline with duration,
with recent research indicating no
chance of transmission after eight years
(Sparling, 1984). Hence, their assumption does not appear to be grossly inaccurate in estimating the impact of syphilis on fertility.

As to whether STD could have led to
reduced fertility via reduced mate exposure, Cohn’s admittedly biased observations (1935, p. 87) are pertinent here:
“The spread of venereal diseases among
Delta Negroes is accelerated by their re

fusal to interrupt sexual activities while
infected, and because many of them
think that a cure can be had by infecting
another person.” Rural blacks participating in the infamous Tuskegee syphilis
experiment likewise did not regard
syphilis as requiring different precautions from any other ailment (Jones,
1981). Therefore, it appears fertility inhibiting impacts of STD were medical,
rather than social, in nature.

Given this background, models can
be constructed to estimate the proportion of the decline that may have occurred due to the spread of syphilis and
gonorrhea. The models rely heavily on
the work of McFalls and McFalls (1984),
but differ from their model on a number
of key assumptions.

RESULTS

STD AND THE FERTILITY DECLINE:
MOobpELs OF IMPACT

Assumptions based on earlier presented evidence concerning the magnitude of the fertility decline in the Delta
and sexual behavior there, the nature of
syphilis and gonorrhea, and assumptions contained in the MF model concerning the national incidence of syphilis and gonorrhea around 1880 were as
follows: Three per cent of the black population in the Delta around 1880 acquired syphilis; new gonorrhea infections outnumbered those of syphilis by
four to one; males and females suffered
in equal numbers; the TFR declined
from 7 to 3 in the period from 1880 to
1940 in the Delta; 80 per cent of the population around 1940 were “‘at risk” (i.e.,
engaged at some time in sexual activities
outside of marriage with other non
Social Biology

virgins and/or married) with 90 per cent
of this number contracting at least one
gonorrhea or syphilis infection; and the
chance of suffering from a subsequent
gonorrhea infection was directly proportional to that of acquiring the previous one.

Four models were developed. For
the estimate of the “low” incidence of
gonorrhea, I assumed that 50 per cent of
the population acquired syphilis and
that the incidence of gonorrhea was 200
per cent. The high incidence rate was
due the tendency of gonorrhea infections to be spontaneously cured within a
few months, even in the absence of
treatment, and the lack of acquired immunity to subsequent infections. However, only 65 per cent of the population
suffered from at least one attack, and
the probability of suffering a subsequent
infection up to ten infections was 67 per
cent. For the estimate of the “high” incidence of gonorrhea, I assumed that
there were six cases of gonorrhea for
each case of syphilis, the justification being earlier cited studies suggesting
greater vulnerability of females and
blacks to gonorrhea infections. In the
“high” model, the chance of a subsequent gonorrhea infection is raised to 80
per cent. The assumption of a 6:1 ratio is
probably more accurate for.females,
given their greater vulnerability. Table 5
shows the estimated spread of syphilis
and gonorrhea in the Delta population
under both the “high” and “low” assumptions.

In developing the “low” model on
the impact of gonorrhea on fertility, I
used the MF model assumptions of 20
per cent of female infections developing
into PID with sterility resulting in 70 per
cent of the cases and a like proportion of
male infections developing into epididymitis with sterility occurring a third of

the time. In the “high” model, 25 per
cent of both male and female infections
developed into sterility threatening
complications with sterility occurring 40
and 80 per cent of the time among males
and females, respectively. The high estimate reflects the facts that malnutrition,
pellagra, and general poor health may
have increased the risk of complications
and resultant sterility, and that black females appear to be more vulnerable to
gonorrhea infections developing into
PID than their white counterparts.
Again, the “high” estimate appears
more likely to be applicable to females.
The MF model assumption that the
chance of sterility occurring from a
given attack is independent of that of the
previous attack and that a person can
become sterile only once is adopted
here.

Proportions infected and rendered
sterile by gonorrhea under the two sets
of assumptions are shown in Table 6.
McFalls and McFalls (1984) argue that
to compute the impact on overall fertility, one should add the male and female
percentages rendered sterile, multiply
the two figures, and subtract the product, since the sterility of one partner is
sufficient to prevent conception. This is
a conservative approach and is adopted

here. In contrast to the MF models,
there is an assumption of one birth before the onset of sterility. Each female
syphilis infection is assumed to have resulted in 0.5 births prevented. Therefore, the increase of 47 per cent in the
proportion suffering from syphilis resulted in the prevention of 0.235 births
in all variants of the model.

Given these assumptions, an average
of 2.01 births were averted in the low incidence, low impact model, or just over
half of the decline of four births in the
1880-1940 period. Calculations for the
low incidence but high impact, high incidence but low impact, and high incidence and high impact models yield estimates of 65, 66, and 81 per cent,
respectively. While the last mentioned
estimate seems too high, the conservative estimate of half is probably too low,
given the greater vulnerability of both
blacks and females to contracting gonorrhea infections, the apparently increased risk of gonorrhea developing
into PID among black females, and the
poor health and nutritional conditions
reducing resistance to STD. Chlamydia
trachomatis may have had an additional
impact, although it is impossible to determine whether it was common in the
era before antibiotics.

STD CONTROL EFFORTS AND
FERTILITY CHANGES

Concerted efforts to combat STD in
the Delta started in the 1930’s with extensive screening and the initiation of
“rapid treatment” centers for treating
syphilis (see Mississippi State Board of
Health, 1933~41). Efforts in the 1930’s
were Jess strenuous against gonorrhea,
but the dissemination of sulfa drugs on a
widespread basis did reduce the incidence of fertility threatening complications.

Although efforts against STD were
intensified during World War IT (Cohn,
1947), progress against gonorrhea was
probably minima] before the discovery
that penicillin was effective against both
syphilis and gonorrhea. In 1944 it was
used at the rapid treatment centers and
by 1945 it was prescribed generally for
STD as well as for a variety of other ailments. However, it was after World
War Il that a coordinated effort was
made to eradicate both gonorrhea and
syphilis.

This effort is best documented for the
Mississippi counties. Efforts there began in 1947 with mass testing of the adult
population in Quitman County and
treatment by penicillin (Gray et al.,
1949), and extended throughout the
Delta in early 1948. Serologic testing
showed the incidence of syphilis among
blacks to be 25 per cent in 1948 (an improvement from 1941) and 3 per cent by
1953 (Smith, 1954). Similar progress
was made against gonorrhea. In 1952
the program was terminated due to a
lack of new treatable cases. Greatly
helping the success of the program was
the enthusiastic support of plantation
owners desiring an improved labor force
(Gray et al. 1949).

Figure 1 shows that the GFR was in

 

Black Fertility Decline 235

the low 90’s in the early 1930’s and in the
neighborhood of 100 in the late 1930’s.
It rose during World War II and is estimated to have been 127 in 1947. It
would not appear that more than a small
part of this increase could be accounted
for directly by the anti-STD efforts, but
improvements in general health resulting from the eradication of pellagra and
malaria, generally improved diets, and
efforts made against TB could have
made the population relatively more resistant to STD and resulting complications as well as modestly improving fecundity independent of influences of
STD. The experience of the Scott Plantation is instructive. As a result of the
anti-STD efforts, the eradication of pellagra and adequate health care, the birth
rate there rose by a quarter during the
1930s to a level 10 to 15 per cent higher
than that of surrounding Bolivar County
(Dill, 1939).

From 1947 to 1956 the estimated
GFR rose rapidly to 204, thereafter leveling off. This rise may be largely explainable by the partial eradication of
gonorrhea and syphilis and is not inconsistent with estimates made here on
what the impact of STD on fertility
might have been. After peaking at 146
in 1948, the white GFR declined to 130
by 1950 and never exceeded that level
during the 1950’s. Also supporting this
interpretation are the patterns of
ASBR’s for 1875-79, 1939-40, and
1959~60 that were examined earlier as
well as the relatively greater TFR increase in the urban population.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

This study addressed the question of
why the TFR in the Delta counties
fronting the Mississippi declined from

around 7 in the late 1870’s to under 3 by
the early 1930’s and then rose to around
6.5 in the late 1950’s. Possibilities examined were changes in contraceptive usage, mate exposure, and fecundity.

The first possibility found little empirical support, although contraceptive
practices could have escaped the notice
of white researchers and local residents.
While the rate of mate exposure may
well have changed during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,
this factor cannot have accounted for
more than a small portion of the decline.
The 1960 census suggested a rather high
rate of mate separation; nonetheless,
fertility was the highest of any region in
the nation. High rates of childlessness in
the 1930’s suggest widespread sterility.
An attempt was made to evaluate the
relative impacts of various impairments
to fertility including those resulting from
psychological causes, nutritional deficiencies, malaria, TB, and STD. The
most potent cause appeared to be the
spread of STD with impairments being
aggravated by poor nutrition and infectious diseases. The increase in the birth
rate in the early 30’s suggests the impact
of improved health conditions, with the
much larger increase after World War Il
resulting from the largely successful assault on STD. Variants of a model based
on the work of McFalls and McFalls
(1984), but differing in key assumptions
generated estimates that from 50-80 per
cent of the 1880-1940 fertility decline
could have been due to the spread of
syphilis and gonorrhea. While the latter
estimate is probably unrealistically high,
the former is based on assumptions that
are probably conservative. Quantifying
the relative impacts of voluntary and
other involuntary causes has not been
attempted, although both were opera
 

 

Social Biology

tive, with the former undoubtedly more
important in urban areas.

Wright and Pirie (1984) estimated
that 56 per cent of the post—1880 black
fertility decline was due to the spread of
STD. This estimate, based on the earlier
mentioned regression, is subject to criticism in that other factors, notably marital stability, that could be correlated
with STD and exercising independent
influences were not considered. Thus,
the model approach developed by McFalls and McFalls (1984) and adopted
here is conceptually preferable. In the
Delta case, marital instability does not
seem to have greatly reduced mate exposure.

Other regional studies are needed to
clarify the factors associated with the
initial black fertility decline. As McFalls, Masnick, Tolnay, and others have
argued, its causes are complex and involve a combination of fertility control
and involuntary causes. The Delta counties represent one extreme in that economic and health conditions were unusually poor, and the pervasiveness of
the plantation system and white supremacy foreclosed realistic chances of blacks
greatly improving their circumstances
except by migration. It certainly seems
plausible that studies of the decline in
other regions marked by less oppressive
conditions would reveal a considerably
greater element of choice. More studies
of this nature that focus on specific areas
will do much to illuminate the relative
importance of voluntary and involuntary factors in the initial black fertility
decline.
