Sex Differentials in Infant
and Child Mortality in Korea

ABSTRACT: This paper reports on a study of infant and child mortality in the Republic of Korea,
acountry known for a strong son preference, using the 1974 World Fertility Survey data. When
the age-specific probabilities of dying for ages zero to five are compared for male and female
children, an unusual pattern of relatively high female mortality is observed. The higher female
mortality is more pronounced during childhood than during infancy. Multivariate analysis of
life tables, using a hazard model, shows that covariates influencing the mortality at young ages
differ for male and female children and suggests that male and female children receive unequal
care by their parents. The analysis also reveals different patterns of interaction between infant
and child mortality and mother’s fertility control behavior depending on the sex of the child.

In most populations, infant and child
mortality is higher for males than for females. However, in some populations
with strong son preference attitudes,
such as those in South Asia and the Middle East, higher female mortality during
late infancy and childhood has been observed (Chen et al., 1981; Meegama,
1980; Scrimshaw, 1978; Simmons et al.,
1983; Tekoe and Shorter, 1984; Trussell
and Hammerslough, 1983). The explanations often include unequal allocation
of food and health care for male and female children by their parents.

The strong preference for male children in Korea is well known, and the
preference is uniformly observed across
different levels of socioeconomic status
of parents (Chung et al., 1972; Chung et
al., 1974; Kwon, 1976). Indications of
higher female mortality during early
childhood and late infancy are also
found in some studies of infant and child
mortality in Korea (Park, 1955; Park
and Park, 1981), although no study has
focused on the sex differentials in infant
and child mortality.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In this paper, a study of sex differentials in infant and child mortality in the
Republic of Korea is reported. The Korean National Fertility Survey (KNFS)
of 1974, which was a part of the World
Fertility Survey (KBOS and KIFP,
1977), is used to examine age patterns,
time trends, and effects of covariates of
infant and child mortality. The KNFS
data include dates of birth of each child
and dates of death for those who died,
together with a number of covariates
known to influence mortality, including
breastfeeding.! The quality of the KNFS
data is known to be excellent both in
coverage of births and deaths and in accuracy of reported dates of events (Park
and Park, 1981; Rindfuss and Bumpass,
1979).

1The Korean National Fertility Survey collected data on breastfeeding behavior for all
births, and the information is available on the onginal data tape used in this report although the information is given only for last two births on the
standard recode tape (KBOS and KIFP, 1977).

LIFE TABLES

We begin with life table computations, specifically, the computation of
ngx, the probability of dying between
ages x and x + n. The upper panel of
Table 1 shows male and female go and
4qi Values computed for infants born
during 1960-65 and 1966-74.

Although it is generally accepted that
male mortality is higher than female
mortality, the standard pattern of sex
differentials in mortality is not well established. While several sets of model
life tables have been developed to provide standard age patterns of mortality,
few provide standard sex differentials.
The regional model life tables by Coale
and Demeny (1983) do, however. They
are Organized by region and level of
mortality with male and female life tables for each region and level. Because
the West and North families of the regional model life tables are known to
match age patterns of Korean life tables
well (Kwon, 1977; Coale et al., 1980),

Sex Differentials 13

we first compare the sex specific infant
and child mortality from the KNFS data
with these model life tables.

The lower panel of Table 1 shows the
model life table male and female ,.q, values from the North and West family
with the level of mortality comparable
to the upper panel. For each pair of the
male and female ,.q, values, the sex ratio
of mortality obtained by dividing the
male ,q, value by the female ,,q, value is
shown.

A striking pattern of sex ratios of
mortality can be seen. While the sex ratios of infant mortality range from 1.22
to 1.33 for the model life tables, they are
between 1.06 and 1.15 for the KNFS
data. Thus a relatively higher female infant mortality is exhibited in the Korean
data than in the regional model life tables. In addition, the deviation from the
model life tables is greater for the infants born in the earlier period. For
child mortality, the deviations are even
greater. The Korean data show higher
female mortality for both time periods,

while the model life tables show higher
male mortality. This finding implies that
female children Korea suffer much
higher mortality than expected by the
overall level of mortality. Again, the differentials in the sex ratios of mortality
are greater for infants born in the earlier
period. If the sex differentials of mortality were due to son preference attitudes,
it can be postulated that these attitudes
are diminishing in the more recent time.

The regional model life tables are
constructed from historical life tables.
Comparisons with more recent life tables are made in Table 2. The male and
female ,q, values for the age groups 0-1
and 1-5 from life tables with comparable infant mortality rates for males are
shown along with the sex ratios of mortality. In these life tables, as in the
model life tables, male mortality is generally higher than female mortality in
both age groups, and the age difference
is greater in the younger age group. Exceptions are found in countries well
known for the low status they give to
women or for having a strong son preference, namely, Jordan, Kuwait, and
Hong Kong. The sex ratios of infant and

child mortality for Korea, regional
model life tables, and other populations
in Tables 1 and 2 are also shown in Figures 1 and 2.

MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS

Now we examine the covariates of infant and child mortality. The hazard
model? of life tables is used for this purpose. The hazard model estimates the
multiplicative effects of covariates on
the age-specific force of mortality in a
multivariate mode. In the simplest
form, all covariates remain unchanged
at all ages, and the effects of covariates
do not depend on the age. This model is
referred to as the proportional hazards
model. A more general form of the hazard model can be specified. The covariates may take different values at different ages. For example, breastfeeding of
an infant may take a value of one before
weaning and a value of zero after wean
2The hazard model for life table analysis is an
extension of the proportional hazards model by
Cox (1972). Trussell and Hammerslough (1983)
give an excellent exposition of the method for demographers, and Trussell and Menken (1984)
summarize strengths and weaknesses of the
model.

ing. Covariates of this type are called
time-varying covariates. Some covariates may remain unchanged at all ages,
but their effects may change depending
on the age. For example, low birth
weight may have a very strong effect on
the survival of an infant during -the first
few days of life but a lesser effect at
older ages. This type of covariate is
called a time-dependent effect covariate. Some covariates may be both timevarying and have time-dependent effect.

In this paper, the analysis is done separately for male and female infants to
determine if some covariates affect mortality differently for the two sexes. An

 

 

alternative approach would be to treat
sex as a dummy variable and to include
interaction terms between sex and other
covariates. For the interaction between
sex and age, sex would be treated as a
time-dependent effect covariate. The
approach used here is simpler but it does
not estimate the effect of sex directly.
The analysis is done separately for firstorder births and higher-order births, because some important covariates such as
birth interval and experience of previous infant deaths are not defined for
the births of order one.

The list of covariates considered, together with their mean values, are given
in Table 3, and Table 4 shows correla

tion coefficients among the covariates.
The correlation coefficients are shown
only for both sexes because they differ
little by sex.

The socioeconomic covariates included are mother’s residence at the
time of the survey and mother’s level of
education. Residence (RES) is coded as
urban (=1) and rural (=0). Mother’s
education is represented by two dummy
variables allowing for three levels: no
formal education (LED = 1, HED =
0), elementary level (LED = 0,
HED = 0), and higher level (LED = 0,
HED = 1).

The covariate IACP indicates mother’s fertility control behavior. It is coded

as one if the mother has had an induced
abortion or used any contraceptives before the survey, and zero otherwise.
The following three covariates,
AGPR, INT1, and INT2 are fertility
variables. The covariate AGPR indicates whether maternal age was exceptionally young relative to the woman’s
parity at the time of birth of each infant
in the analysis. The coding is dichotomous: 1 if parity is relatively high for the
maternal age, and 0 otherwise. The coding was determined by examining the infant mortality for births cross-classified
by maternal age and parity. The following combinations of parity and maternal
age are coded as one: Parity 1 and maDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:41 08 December 2015

infancy and childhood, and in the hazard model the ideal is to treat it as a
time-varying covariate. However, because the coding of breastfeeding in the
KNEFS data is given in number of months
while age at death is computed in number of days, and because the breastfeeding data exhibit substantial heaping, it is
difficult to treat it as a time varying covariate. Moreover, the effect of breastfeeding may be stretched over quite
some time after weaning. For example,
it is unlikely that the immunity passed to
infant from mother through the breast
milk will disappear as soon as breastfeeding is discontinued. Therefore, the
covariate is coded dichotomously as sufficient (=1) and insufficient (=0) feeding.

Infants who were breastfed for
twelve months or longer are considered
to have been breastfed sufficiently. Infants who died before reaching twelve
months of age are considered to have
had sufficient breastfeeding if the
breastfeeding continued up to the time
of death or if weaning was within four
weeks of the time of death. Thus, infants

Vol. 34, No. 1-2

who stopped breastfeeding because of
illness and died soon after will have
breastfeeding code equal to one (sufficient). Infants who never began breastfeeding because of illness have breastfeeding code equal to zero. If there are
many such infants our estimate of
breastfeeding effect will be exaggerated. For infants who were less than
twelve months of age and surviving at
the time of survey, sufficient breastfeeding code was assigned if the infant was
currently breastfeeding or had been
breastfeeding up to four weeks prior to
the survey. As the mean values show,
this is a very skewed variable, with more
than 80 per cent of infants having been
breastfed sufficiently.

The covariate BY indicates year of
birth and is treated as an interval variable.

The mean values of the covariates are
similar for male and female children
with the following exceptions. The
mean value of the fertility control variable IACP is larger for male children,
showing that women who have some
male children are more likely to have
used contraceptive methods or induced
abortion. Among the births of order
one, the mean value of the succeeding
birth interval INT2 is larger for females,
implying a shorter average birth interval
following a female first birth. For births
of higher order, the mean values of succeeding birth interval do not differ
much. It is interesting to note that Park’s
analysis of the same data shows the proportion of women progressing to a next
birth to be much higher after a female
birth (Park, 1983).

RESULTS

The hazard model effects of covariates an infant and child mortality are es

timated separately by sex and birth order of children. The age at death was
coded in number of weeks, and the effects of all covariates are assumed to be
constant within the age intervals 0 to 12
months (infant mortality) and 1 to 5
years (child mortality) but different
across the two age intervals.

The upper panel of Table 5 shows the
cumulative hazard of dying during infancy and early childhood for infants
born in 1960-74 by sex and birth order
after adjusting for the effects of covariates. It shows that infant mortality is
higher for births of order one and for
males. Child mortality shows the opposite pattern. It is lower for births of order one and for males. The first order
births may be biologically weaker and
thus suffer higher mortality during the
first year of life when biological factors
are important determinants of mortality. However, the first-order children
are likely to receive more attention and
better health care and thus have lower
mortality during the early childhood
when the environmental factors are important determinants of mortality. Similar arguments may apply to male infants. They are biologically weaker but
are cared for better in Korea where the
male children are desired more than the
female children.

Figure 3 compares adjusted infant
and child mortality by sex for each age
and birth order group with the model
life table mortality by sex. For each age
group, the North and West regional
model life tables with matching male
mortality are chosen and the corresponding female mortality from the
model life tables are shown by dotted
lines along with observed female mortality indicated by the solid lines. In each
of the age and birth order group, the
Korean data show excess female mortal

nomic variables (RES, LED, and HED)
on infant and child mortality are weak.
Among twelve coefficients, only two are
statistically significant. Mother’s education of more than elementary level
lowers both infant and child mortality of
females significantly.

It is interesting to see that the fertility
contro] variable is a significant covariate
for male infant mortality but not for female infant mortality. It is likely that
women who have not experienced infant deaths will use contraceptive methods and induced abortion more often
than women who have experienced
male infant deaths. In Korea, most
women use contraceptive methods and
induced abortion after having achieved

the desired family size (Pebley et al.,
1985). Our finding suggests that the decision to limit family size depends on the
family’s experience of male infant
deaths. Earlier study on family building
in Korea has found that the decision to
have more children is influenced by
whether the family already has borne a
male child (Park, 1983).

Neither of the fertility variables
(AGPR and INT2) is statistically significant. For the births of order one, the
maternal age and the length of succeeding birth interval do not affect the survival of the child before age 5. Note that
the births of order one have higher infant mortality than other births for both
SEXES.

Breastfeeding is a statistically significant covariate for both infant and child
mortality and for both sexes.

Two of the four coefficients for the
time of birth are statistically significant.
Although the KNFS data is thought to
have excellent pregnancy history data, it
is unlikely that the reporting is complete. Because first-order births that did
not survive are more likely to be omitted
from the pregnancy history, the coefficients for time of birth may be an underestimate of the true value, and the
true time trends of infant and child mortality may be larger than those implied
by the coefficients.

BirTH ORDER > 1

For the births of order greater than
one, socioeconomic variables have even
less effect on infant and child mortality;
only one of the twelve coefficients is statistically significant. Urban residence of
mother lowers female infant mortality.

Again, the fertility control variable
IACP is statistically significant for males
only, and the same argument as given
for first-order births may apply.

The relatively young maternal age for
parity (AGPR) raises male child mortality significantly. Why this covariate
shows different effects on children of
different sex and at different ages is not
clear.

The preceding birth interval (INT1)
is a Statistically significant covariate for
male and female infant mortality, and
for female child mortality. The short
birth interval may affect mortality in two
ways. First, the short birth intervals may
be related to premature births and lower
birth weights, resulting in higher infant
mortality. Second, short birth interval
may affect mortality by way of competition for resources, which may result in
higher child mortality. However, in the

Social Biology

Korean data, the male child mortality is
not affected by a shorter preceding birth
interval. The difference may be explained by child-caring behavior that
prefers male children. Male children
may receive better allocation of resources and health care even in the presence of other competing children close
in ages, thus making the effect of preceding birth interval variable statistically insignificant. A maternal and child
health care project in a rural area in Korea reports that after three years of education on child health care with increased number of health care
personnel and clinics, the visits to child
health care clinics increased but disproportionately more for male children. It
reports that during last twelve months of
the project, 85 per cent of the male children of age under five visited the health
clinics compared to the 50 per cent of the
female children (Kim, 1979).

The succeeding birth interval (INT2)
is a statistically significant covariate for
child mortality for both sexes and not
significant for infant mortality for either
sex. The children who experience a birth
of another child in the family at very
young ages may have less chance of survival due to competition for mother’s attention and resources. And because
these factors are environmental, the
child mortality is affected significantly
while infant mortality is not. It seems
contradictory that the succeeding birth
interval is a significant factor for male
child mortality but the preceding birth
interval is not. It may be that women
with strong son preference attitudes
may deliberately lengthen the interval
following the birth of a male child, leaving the women who are less likely to exercise preferential care of male children
subject to short succeeding birth intervals. This argument is partly supported

 
Vol. 34, No. 1-2

by the smaller mean value of the succeeding birth interval for male children
in Table 3.

The experience of infant death
(INFD) by an older sibling is a statistically significant covariate for infant
deaths for both sexes, but not for child
mortality. The experience of infant
death may be considered as a proxy for
the unmeasured tendency of women to
give births to children with less favorable conditions for survival. This finding
is consistent with the observations that
infant mortality is due more to the biological factors, and child mortality is due
more to environmental factors.

The breastfeeding variable is statistically significant three out of four times.
Sufficient breastfeeding Jowers infant
# mortality of both sexes, and male child
= mortality significantly. A study on
.o breastfeeding in Korea using the same
KNFS data shows that for the children
born during the four-year period before
the survey, the sex of the child has a
weak but significant effect on the decision of Korean women to breastfeed
(Nemeth, 1981). These findings together imply that the male infant and
child mortality would be lower than the
female mortality after adjustments are
made for other factors.

The coefficients for the covariate indicating year of birth (BY) are larger for
female child mortality, implying that the
inequality for female children was
greater in the past.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

Compared to most other populations, Korean female children experience excess mortality before age five, especially between ages one and five. The
excess mortality is larger for the children
of birth order greater than one and for

 

Sex Differentials 23

the children born in the more distant
past.

The hazard model analysis of covariates of infant and child mortality show
the following:

1. Mortality at age zero is higher for male
and female infants
(a) if mother experienced previous infant death,

(b) if they receive insufficient breastfeeding,

(c) if they are born less than two years
after the previous birth,

(d) and if their birth order is one.

2. For male infants, mother’s experience
of induced abortions or use of contraceptive methods is associated with
lower infant mortality.

3. For births of order one, urban residence and mother’s higher education
is associated with lower female infant
mortality.

1. Mortality between ages one and five is
higher for male and female children
(a) if they receive insufficient breast
feeding.

(b) and if they have older siblings and
are followed by another birth in
less than two years.

' 2. For male children of.higher birth order, child mortality is higher if maternal age was unusually young for the
birth order.

3. For male children of higher birth order, child mortality is lower if mother
had experienced induced abortion or
had used contraceptive methods.

4. Female child mortality is higher for
those who were born less than two
years after the previous birth. The preceding birth interval does not have significant effect on the male child mortality.

Besides the two strong covariates,
namely, the previous experience of infant death and breastfeeding, the fertility variables show stronger association
with infant and child mortality than the
socioeconomic variables. this finding
suggests that promotion of family plan

ning programs can play an important
role in improving infant and child
health.

The examination of the effects of covariates suggests that the unusually high
female infant and child mortality is
partly due to unequal care of male and
female children by their parents. Further studies with detailed information
on infant feeding, well baby care, as well
as On more proximate covariates of infant and child mortality such as birth

weight, congenital conditions, and prenatal care would throw additional light
on this tentative conclusion.
