Behavioral Genetics

 

 

Proposed Organization of an Association of

Behavioral Genetics

An informal meeting of participants at
the 1969 Princeton Conference on Populations Genetics, November 8, discussed further action in respect to organization of an
Association of Behavioral Genetics.

It was decided that a more extensive
mailing to persons publishing in the field of
behavioral genetics was desirable and that
such a mailing should include a ballot for
election of an Organizing Committee.

Drs. L. Erlenmeyer-Kimling, Elving Anderson, and John Loehlin were requested
to prepare this second mailing. The results
of the ballot will be counted and discussed
at an informal meeting of this group attending the AAAS meetings in Boston,
December 30. The results of the ballot and
further organizing plans will be announced
in the March issue of Soctal Biology.
