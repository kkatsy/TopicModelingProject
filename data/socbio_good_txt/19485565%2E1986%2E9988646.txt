A Suicide Epidemic Model

Barry R. Davis and Robert J. Hardy

School of Public Health
University of Texas
Houston, Texas

ABSTRACT: An epidemic model of suicides clustered in time and space is presented. In this
model suicides are depicted as an infection that can be spread from person to person. The model
is based on the assumption that spread of suicide ideation via various means of communication
increases as the number of suicides increases. A threshold condition for an epidemic to begin
and the total size of an epidemic can be calculated. The model is applied to several previous

suicide episodes.

The concept of a suicide epidemic has
been discussed in the literature and mass
media for many years (Ashton and Donnan, 1979; Barraclough et al., 1977;
Crawshaw, 1980; Gelman, 1983; Kreitman et al., 1969; Motto, 1967; Nalin,
1972; Rubenstein, 1983; Taylor, 1984;
Whitlock, 1975). This terminology has
been applied to clusters of suicides.
These clusters in time and space are
called epidemic when the observed
number of suicides is substantially
greater than the expected number. The
clusters become particularly apparent
when the deaths are among adolescents.

Recently, there have been several
clusters of teenage suicides in the
United States (Gelman and Gangelhoff,

983; Taylor, 1984). In such instances a
single event appears to trigger a Sequence of suicides. Several investigators
have studied whether publicity increases
suicides (Blumenthal and Bergner,
1973; Bollen and Phillips, 1982; Motto,
1967; Motto, 1970; Phillips, 1974). The
primary focus of this research is to determine whether or not extensive media
coverage of a suicide results in an in
creased suicide rate in an impressionable population.

Phillips (1974) proposed that suicides
increase immediately after a suicide
story has been publicized in the newspapers. The more publicity devoted to a
story, the larger the rise in suicides
thereafter. The rise in suicides is mainly
restricted to the area in which the story
was publicized. He stated that the rise in
suicides is due to the influence of
suggestion—something he called the
Werther effect, named after the protagonist in Goethe’s novel The Sorrows of
the Young Werther. In this novel, the
hero committed suicide. The book was
widely read in Europe, and it was said
that people in many countries imitated
Werther’s manner of death.

A major contribution to the study of
suicide was made at the end of the last
century by the French sociologist Emile
Durkheim (1951). In an attempt to explain suicide patterns, he divided suicides into three social categories: egoistic, altruistic, and anomic.

Egoistic suicide comprised those who
were assumed not to have been strongly

integrated into any social group. Family
integration or the lack of it could be used

to explain why the unmarried were

more vulnerable to suicide than the married and why couples with children were
the best protected of all.

Altruistic suicide described the group
whose proneness to suicide stemmed
from their excessive integration into a
group. Durkheim was describing the
kind of suicide that could be expected of
certain classes in Japanese society at
that time.

Anomic suicide occurred when a disturbance in the balance of the person’s
integration with society leaves him without his customary norms of behavior.
Anomie could explain the greater incidence of suicide among the divorced as
compared with the married. Phillips
(1974) presented some theoretical relationships for the possibility of the influence of suggestion on suicide as it relates to anomic individuals. He stated
that studies of suicide and of collective
behavior indicate that anomic persons
are susceptible to solutions to their anomie. Persons who find no meaning in life
are thought to be susceptible to religious
and political movements which provide
them with coherent belief systems that
reduce their anomie. Committing suicide or joining certain social movements
may be alternative solutions to the general problem of anomie. If suicide and
social movements are sometimes alternative solutions to the problem of anomie, why do some anomic individuals
then choose suicide? Phillips proposed
that it was due to the publicity of certain
events and the unavailability or inadequacy of anomie-reducing social movements.

The type of publicity given to suicide
should affect the suicide rate. Studies of
suggestion (Lang and Lang, 1961) indicate that a model is more likely to be im

itated if he is prestigious and if his circumstances are thought to be similar to
the imitator.

Phillips (1974, 1977, 1978, 1980,
1982a, 1982b, 1983) has presented a thesis through several articles that suicides,
motor vehicle fatalities, and airplane accidents increase after publicized stories
about one of these particular events. In
his 1980 paper, he presented a sociological theory of imitation and suggestion.
He proposed to conceive of imitation as
a kind of cultural contagion and described six analogies of biological and
cultural contagion. These analogies
were:

1. Incubation period.— Just as the
symptoms of a disease may appear sometime after a person is infected, the response to a publicized suicide may have a
lag time.

2. Immunization.—People become
immune to specific infectious diseases.
Why can’t they become immune to the

~ idea of suicide?

3. Specific versus diffuse contagion.—
Specific organisms cause specific diseases. Publicity about a particular suicide
may result in suicides committed in a similar fashion, e.g., wrist cuts, hangings,
firearms, etc.

4. Susceptibility to contagion.—
Persons in poor biological health may be
more susceptible to biological contagion.
Persons who are anomic, have a low selfesteem, and a past history of failure may
be said to be in poor cultural and psychological health. Are these people susceptible to cultural contagion?

5. Channels of infection.—Infectiow
diseases can be spread through different
media—air, air, water, person-to-person.
Cultural contagion could be spread by
newspapers, television, or by word of
mouth.

6. Quarantine.—The spread of infectious disease can be slowed or stopped by
quarantining infectious individuals.

- Could a cultural quarantine similarly reduce the spread of a cultural contagion?
Would less publicity devoted to a suicide
result in less of a “contagious effect?”

The purpose of this paper is to
present an epidemic model of suicide in
‘ corporating a number of the elements of

Phillips’ theory of imitation and suggestion as it relates to the occurrence of suicides in a population. In this mode] suicides are depicted in much the same way
as an infection that can be spread from
person to person. This arises from an assumption that spread of the epidemic via
various means of communication -increases as the number of suicides increases. Applications of the model are
presented along with a discussion of the
implication of the model for the development and spread of a suicide epidemic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A mathematical model of a biological
or behavioral process attempts to describe underlying relationships in mathematical terms. It is of necessity an exact
expression of these presumed relationships. In the model which we present,
we are trying to express very complex
behavioral patterns with a relatively
simple mathematical function. The
result is a gross simplification of the
many factors which influence the process, but it does so while retaining those
which are the salient features.

In the suicide epidemic model, the
population is assumed to be composed
of individuals susceptible to committing
suicide, individuals who have committed suicide as part of the epidemic, and
individuals who have always been or
who have recently become “immune”
to committing suicide. The model describes the relationship between these
three groups of individuals.

Let Np be the total size of the population in the age group that will be affected
by a knowledge of a suicide in their age
group. This population can be charac
Suicide Epidemic Model 293

terized as consisting of three parts: Sg,
[,, and Do where Sp +:L9 + Do = No.

So is the initial number of susceptible
members of the population who if ‘‘effectively” reached will commit suicide.
These are the individuals whom Phillips
describes as being in poor cultural and
psychological health. Jp is the initial
number of members of the population,
who with the same information that is
available to members of So, will never
take their own lives, i.e., they are immune. Dois the initial suicide in the population. Since most series of suicides begin with an initial single event, Do is
usually one.

Now consider some arbitrary time, f,
beyond the initial event. At that point,
let S(‘) = number of individuals who
are susceptible and therefore are potential suicide victims in interval (0,¢).

J(t) = number of individuals who are
immune, 1.e., will not commit suicide in interval (0,2).

D(t) = number of individuals who actually commit suicide in interval

(0,1)

A person who is susceptible may
commit suicide or become immune, but
once he becomes immune, he will never
become susceptible again and will never
take his own life. This is a simplification
in that it is conceivable that a person
who becomes immune for a period of
time may in time become susceptible
again. We assume that the number of
suicides is proportional to both the number of suicides that have already occurred and the number of susceptibles in
the population. The more suicides that
have occurred, the more likely it is that
the idea of suicide will spread and ap
‘pear as an option to those susceptible.

The more susceptibles there are, the
more likely it is that a suicide will occur.

294 Davis and Hardy

Also, we assume that the number of
immunes is proportional to the number
of immunes and susceptibles. The more
immune individuals there are, the more
likely it is that their influence will prevent further suicides; the more susceptibles there are, the more likely it is they
will become immune.

In the model there is a competition
for the susceptible population to either
commit suicide or become immune.
Thus, the larger the susceptible population, the more likely itis both that anew
suicide will occur and that the number of
immunes will increase.

The following system of differential
equations describes the model at time ¢
after the initial suicide which began the
epidemic process.

where p = “suicide infection’”’ rate

and B = “suicide possibility” removal
rate.

The parameters, 1 and B, are the rate

_at which susceptibles commit suicide

and the rate at which susceptibles become immune, respectively. In the next
section, we will estimate the ratio of
these two parameters, 2/8, from the

Social Biology

data by using a nonlinear regression
method.

There is a large body of literature on
the solution to such a system of equations. They are with minor modifications the Kermack and McKendrick
(1927) equations for an epidemic process with removal of individuals from risk
of subsequent infection. In this instance
a substitution which gives an approximate solution to Equations (2) to (4)
provides a solution which is simple to
use and is suitable to a suicide epidemic
process. |

At the start of the epidemic when
t = 0, the epidemic is initiated by a single suicide; hence,

(S(0), 10), D(O)) = (8-1, Io, 1).

Since the number of actual suicides is
rarely large, we assume that D< < Np.
This is not unreasonable as the total
number of suicides will be much less
than the population size. The right-hand
side of Equation (4) now becomes
BI(No — J) and the solution for J is

I(t) _ NolLo/(No —Iy)] exp(Brit)
~ 1+ [ig(No —Io] exp(BNot) ©)

In Equation (2) we again assume that
D<<WM), and that pD(No -I—-D) is
approximately equal to ~D(No—J).
Substituting J into this expression, the
solution to Equation (2) becomes

D(t) =

1 p
(a, + Carvey BHD) ©

where p =
1/8 = 1/(relative removal rate).

Vol. 33, No. 3-4

Att = 1, this becomes D = (No/Ip)?.

Equation (6) is a logistic-type equation with unknown parameters Jy, p, and
8. In a closed population of size Np and
with specification of these parameters,
one can calculate the total number of suicides that will occur.

A THRESHOLD CONDITION

Before applying the model to actual
data on the temporal occurrence of suicides, we wish to further analyze Equation (2) to obtain conditions under
which an epidemic will continue. For the
moment we drop the argument t for D(t)
and J(1) in the subsequent analysis.

Let us divide Equation (2) by Equation (4) to get dD/dl = pD/BI.

The solution to this equation for d is
D = kI*® where k is a constant and for
convenience D is expressed in terms of
the reciprocal of the relative removal
rate, p, to get D = k/?. The initial condition where D(0) = 1, determine the
constant k = Ig-?, and hence

D= (1/ Ip)?
Or
[= IpD".,

Substituting this result into Equation
(1) yields the derivative of D with re
“spect tot,

D!' = pD(No —D —LhD"*).
In order for the epidemic to continue,
D'>0
or
No ~-D —[,D¥e >0

or
No > D + IpD"?.

 

Suicide Epidemic Model 295

If we assume
D<< IpD",

or the number of suicides is much less
than the number of immunes, this reduces to

No > [pD'e or
or (7)
D< (No/ Io)? ,

The epidemic stops when D’ = 0, or
equivalently where D = (No/ Ip)? as we
derived previously (Equation [6}).

So, for the epidemic to continue beyond a second suicide, (No/Jo)? must be
greater than 2 or

(Ip/No) <2-8!#, (8)

Since Ig ~ No —So Equation (8) becomes

(So/No) z= 1 ~2-8,

The relative removal rate B/w therefore gives us a threshold proportion (So/
No) for the number of susceptibles to go
beyond two suicides.

STATISTICAL METHODS

Estimates of the parameters p, /p/No,
and BNo were obtained by using a nonlinear regression method. The SAS
NLIN procedure (SAS User’s Guide,
1982) provides least-squares estimates
of these parameters. The procedure
used was the Marquardt Iterative
method.

For the nonlinear model
Y= F(Bo Bi, sey B.,X1, X2, v8 oy Xn)

+e= FP) +e,

the nonlinear “normal” equations are
XF'(B) = X'y where X = 85F/8B.

In the nonlinear situation, both X
and F(R) are functions of B, and a
closed-form solution. generally does not
exist. Thus, one uses an iterative process. A starting value for B is chosen and
continually improved until the error
sum-of-squares e’ € (SSE) is minimized.

The iterative techniques to estimate
parameters in nonlinear regression used
are similar to a series of linear regressions involving the matrix X evaluated
for the current values of B and y = Y—
Y, where Y = F(B) are the predicted
values evaluated for the current values
of p.

The iterative process begins at some
point Bo. Then X and Y are employed to
compute a A such that

SSE(Bo + A)<SSE(B.).

The updating formula is in the Marquardt method (1963):

A = (X'X' + ddiag(X'X’))“1X'y.

Marquardt’s method is equivalent to
performing a Series of ridge regressions
and is most useful when the parameter
estimates are highly correlated.

RESULTS

In order to illustrate the utility of the
model, we will apply it to three sets of
suicide cluster data sets obtained with
permission from the Centers for Disease
Control, Atlanta, Georgia. The data
sets are presented in Table 1 according
to the number of suicides and number of
weeks after the occurrence of the first
suicide in the series.

The first cluster of teenage suicides
occurred over about a one-year period

in Plano, Texas, during 1983 and 1984.
The second cluster occurred in Clear
Lake City, Texas, over about a fourmonth period in 1984. The last cluster

took place in 1985 on the Wind River

Reservation in Wyoming, where nine
young people took their lives over a
three-month period. In addition, two
variations of the Wind River data set are
also presented. These variations are (1)
the final suicide is deleted from the data
set, or (2) the next to final suicide is deleted from the data set. These variations
were chosen because there were four suicides in the last week of the Wind River
cluster. This might unduly influence the
model toward predicting a large total
number of suicides. We thus wished to
explore the implications of variations in
the data.

Table 2 presents the estimated parameters for each of the three suicide
clusters plus the predicted total number
of suicides and the initial proportion of
suicides necessary for the epidemic to
continue beyond two suicides. In addition, the estimated parameters for the
two variations of the Wind River data
set are also presented.

The reciprocal of the relative removal rate, p= p/P, ranged from

Suicide Epidemic Model

297

14,270 (Plano) to 16.194 (Wind River—
W1). The variations on the Wind River
data set yielded 14.073 (W2) and 13.459
(W3). The predicted total number of suicides were similar to the actual number
for the Plano and Clear Lake epidemics.
However, the predicted number for the
Wind River epidemic is much higher
than the actual number. The variations
decreased the predicted number, but
even variation W3’s predicted number
of about 25 is almost three times the actual number of 9. |

The observed and predicted values
for each of the three suicide epidemics
are presented in Figure 1. The model’s
predicted values appear to agree best for
the Plano and the Wind River data. Figure 2 presents a comparison of the
models for the three epidemics plus the
two variations of the Wind River data.

DISCUSSION

Several researchers have stressed
how publicity after a suicide can lead to
further suicides among a susceptible
population. If we consider the publicity
as some sort of vector transmitting a
“suicide infection,” then a suicide cluster behaves like an epidemic.

The model presented in this paper is
one of the simplest forms for a deterministic model of an epidemic. Further refinements of this model could be made,
including extension to stochastic versions. However, even at this basic level,
several useful features should be noted.

In the applications of the model,
there was some consistency among the
estimated parameters. About 15 to 30
per cent of the populations at risk were
susceptible to committing suicide. The
thresholds for the epidemics continuing
beyond two suicides ranged from 4.2 per
cent to 4.7 per cent (up to 5.1 per cent if
we include the variations).

The model] predicts an asymptotic total number of suicides. In the case of the
Plano and Clear Lake epidemics, the
predicted numbers were close to the actual ones. In the Wind River epidemic,
the predicted number was much greater
than the actual one. Several assumptions in the model may account for this.
These assumptions include (1) constant
“infection” and “‘removal” rates, (2) a

closed population, (3) the notion of
once immune always immune. In the
case of any of the three clusters examined, one or all of these assumptions
may be incorrect.

In addition, there is no good definition of what a suicide cluster or epidemic
is. All suicides that occur in a specified
region and time period may either not
be a suicide or may not be part of the epidemic. On the other hand, deaths in a
specified region and time period that are
due to suicide may not be classified as
such due to insufficient information. If
one of the suicides was not part of the
epidemic, then this can easily change the
parameters of a model, as seen by examining the variations of the Wind River
data set.

In conclusion, we have presented a
simple form of a deterministic model of
a suicide epidemic. We hope that suicide
clusters viewed from an epidemic viewpoint may lead to both further work and
insight into the phenomenon of suicide
clusters.
