Endogamous Populations

ABSTRACT: The survival of small endogamous human populations is investigated by computer
simulation. It is shown that (1) populations practicing strict monogamy with no extramarital
pregnancy are less likely to survive as endogamous groups than are those in which marriage
is not a prerequisite for childbearing; (2) low fertility—low mortality populations can survive
with fewer individuals than can populations subject to high fertility and mortality; (3) avoidance of
close consanguinity reduces the probability of population survival, but the effect is much greater
when fertility and mortality are low. In addition, an attempt is made to determine which demographic characteristics are likely to be the best predictors of potential population decline or dis
ruption.

The concept of minimum population size
is important in demographic investigations
of the probability of survival of small isolated populations, in considerations of the
stability of mating systems, and in studies
of the role of genetic drift in human evolution. Livi (1949) reviewed the literature
on small endogamous populations and concluded, on the basis of observed population
sizes, that populations of fewer than three
hundred individuals are unlikely to survive; that populations of three hundred to
five hundred individuals are in a state of
déséquilibre, on the borderline between
survival and extinction; and that, in general, population sizes have to exceed five
hundred in order to insure survival. Livi’s
original work was elaborated upon by
Sutter and Tabah (1951) and by Segalen
and Jacquard (1973), who discussed the
demographic factors which are important
in determining minimum viable size.

However, there seem to have been no
attempts to approach the problem systematically, either analytically or by simulation. An analytical solution to the problem
of minimum population size must await the

development of a realistic two-sex model
of population growth, which must incorporate a marriage model. Existing two-sex
models (see, for example, Das Gupta, 1972,
1973; Fredrickson, 1971; Goodman, 1953,
1967, 1968; Karmel, 1947, 1948a,b; Kendall, 1949; Keyfitz and Murphy, 1967)
are not adequate for our purpose because
they do not allow for variability in male
and female fertility as a result of fluctuations in the availability of mates. Some
progress has been made in constructing
marriage models (see McFarland, 1972,
for a review), but none of the models proposed is appropriate for examining the
growth or decline of small age-structured
human populations.

In this study we consider the problem
of minimum size of endogamus populations
under selected sets of demographic conditions. We examine the effect of (1) mating
pattern and (2) fertility and mortality
level upon population survival by analyzing the demographic characteristics of artificial populations generated with a computer simulation model. Our aim has been
to determine the minimum size at which

populations of various demographic types
can survive as endogamous groups without changing their mating or fertility behavior.

It would be expected that in populations
in which long-term exclusive pair bonding
(that is, monogamous marriage) occurs
and in which only married women reproduce, minimum size would have to be
greater than in populations in which marriage is not necessary for childbearing. In
order to study the extent to which strict
monogamy reduces a population’s chances
for survival, we have chosen two types of
mating patterns which differ radically in
their assumptions about the relationship
between marriage and reproduction. Likewise, for a given mating pattern, the likelihood of population survival depends upon
the fertility and mortality level. A population with high fertility and mortality will
have more stochastic variability in population size and will also have a higher proportion of marriages interrupted than will
a low fertility-low mortality population of
the same size and mating pattern. To examine these relationships, we have chosen
two quite different fertility and mortality
schedules which, however, would produce
approximately the same growth rates if
all individuals of reproductive age had
mates.

We have not attempted to simulate the
entire range of demographic structures experienced by human populations. In particular, by our choice of fertility and mortality characteristics and mating rules, we
have specifically excluded many technologically primitive populations with clan
or lineage structure. Although the minimum size of such populations has important implications for studies of long-term
evolution, there are so many variations in
mating structure among them that it would
have been difficult to arrive at general conclusions. Moreover, the demographic data

Social Biology

available for such populations, particularly
with respect to fertility, are limited. Since
our primary goal in this initial study is to
demonstrate the effects of differences in
certain demographic characteristics on
minimum viable size rather than to determine the minimum size for any specific
population, we have selected contrasting
sets of input parameters from model tables
which have been compiled from the available data from a large number of contemporary human populations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
THE MODEL

Artificial demographic histories were generated using a stochastic discrete-time microsimulation model, a modification of
models described previously (MacCluer,
1967, 1974: MacCluer and Schull, 1970;
MacCluer et al., 1971). The simulations
included in this study were done on an
IBM 370/165 computer. Initial populations were created in such a way that the
age distribution of each was as close as
possible to one of several specified stable
age distributions, subject to the restrictions
imposed by small population size.

Each individual in an initial population
was characterized by an identifying number, sex, and birth date. Each adult female
was assigned a husband, and each child
was assigned parents according to specified
distributions of age differences between
spouses and between mother and child.
Demographic histories extending for two
hundred years were generated by artificially projecting an initial population on
a year-by-year basis. Marriage, reproduction, and survival were simulated for each
individual in a population, and the population list was updated as marriages occurred,
new individuals were born, and old ones
died. This sequence of events was repeated two hundred times, once for each
year. The model is also capable of simu

lating divorce, migration between subdivisions of the population or to the outside,
and immigration from an infinite external
source. However, these options were not
utilized in the simulations described here,
for reasons to be discussed below.

Age and sex-specific probabilities of survival were taken from Coale and Demeny
(1966); age-specific probabilities of reproducing for married women were derived

, from the model age patterns of fertility
=given in the Population Bulletin of the
“United Nations (United Nations, 1963,
Spp. 110-111), utilizing the birth rate for
® females in the stable population as given
A by Coale and Demeny. For all simulaee tions, the stable population selected was
w one which had an intrinsic rate of increase
coof r= 0.005. Thus, if all females in the
artificial populations had had mates during
‘gtheir entire reproductive periods, these
Opopulations would have been expected to
increase at a rate of 0.5 per cent per year.
2 This slightly positive rate was chosen on
¢ the basis of our previous experience with
Z simulation of populations in which marYriage is a prerequisite for most reproducE tion (in which case the actual rate of in“> crease is invariably less than the intrinsic
urate).
~ Marriage was simulated by (1) forming
Ca list of males who would search for mates
sand a list of females who were available
Qfor marriage; and (2) giving each male in
turn an opportunity to find a mate of the
appropriate age and degree of family relationship. Males were entered on the list
according to an age-specific probability of
searching for a mate. In order to assure
that all members of the population married
as soon as possible, and thus to avoid a
bias toward decreased population growth,
all these probabilities were set equal to
one. In other words, all single males were
entered in the list as long as they were of
marriageable age.

a

Minimum Population Size 3

In all simulations, males could marry between ages 17 and 65; females, between
ages 15 and 50. The age difference between
mates (A = male age minus female age)
was restricted to the interval —5 < A < 20
and was assumed to be normally distributed with a mean which increased as a
function of male age. No individual survived beyond age 80.

In addition, the simulations had the
following features in common: (1) Marriages between siblings and between parents
and offspring were prohibited. (2) Marriages were interrupted only by the death
of a spouse. Divorce was prohibited in
order to simplify the task of interpreting
the relationships between mortality level
and population survival. (3) Age-specific
probabilities of reproducing and dying remained constant over time, again in order
to make more obvious the effects of differences in fertility, mortality, and mating
patterns on minimum size.

It is likely that any population facing
extinction would either change its patterns
of mating and reproduction or increase its
efforts to make contacts with other populations, thus violating one or both of the
last two restrictions. Our studies are intended to indicate how small a population
may be without having to modify its behavior to insure survival. Although, historically, human populations are unlikely
to have maintained constant vital rates for
as long as two hundred years, runs of this
length were made in order to assure that
the effects of initial population structure
would be minimized and to enable us to
distinguish between long-term declines in
population size and temporary perturbations.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
The goal of these simulation experiments
was to investigate the extent to which mating pattern and fertility and mortality level

influence population survival under conditions of complete endogamy. We selected
two mating patterns which we expected to
have quite different consequences for population survival. We also used a third pattern which was a variation of one of the
two basic ones.

Type 1 mating pattern assumed no marriage at all. The probability of reproducing
for a female was a function only of her
age and of the availability of an appropriate male to be the father of her child.
Women chose a father for each child on
the basis of age, with age difference between mates held approximately the same
as that between marrying couples in simulations with marriage. Thus, women of
childbearing age were prohibited from reproducing only by a shortage of appropriate males, and it was quite likely that
each child borne by a woman would have
a different father. This mating pattern represents an extreme form of the pattern to
be expected in populations with a high frequency of extramarital pregnancy and/or
a high rate of divorce and remarriage.

Type 2 mating pattern assumed strict
monogamy. Individuals married as soon as
they could find an appropriate mate and
remained married until they or their
spouses died. In these simulations, all reproduction was carried out by married
couples. Both males and females who were
widowed during the reproductive period
could remarry if they could find an appropriate mate, but some individuals were unable to do so and were therefore removed
from the reproductive pool. The Type 2
mating pattern, perhaps also an unrealistic extreme, may be taken to represent
those societies in which marriage is considered important, divorce is prohibited,
and extramarital pregnancy is rare.

These two mating patterns are in no
way intended to encompass the range of

Social Biology

human mating behavior. In contrasting
mating types 1 and 2, we wish merely to
investigate the relationship between population survival and the size of the pool
of available mates. In Type 2 populations,
this pool is maintained at a minimum size
by sampling without replacement (early
marriage, rapid remarriage after widowhood, no extramarital pregnancy). In contrast, the size of the mate pool is maximized in populations of Type 1, in which
all individuals of reproductive age are
continuously in the pool (sampling with
replacement). In order to test the effects
of avoidance of close consanguinity (beyond the nuclear family) on minimum
size, an additional set of simulations was
done with a modified Type 2 mating pattern. This pattern (Type 3) was identical
to Type 2 except that no marriages were
permitted between individuals related as
closely as first cousins.

The relationship between fertility and
mortality level and minimum viable size of
a population will depend upon the mating
pattern; but in general one might expect
that in strictly monogamous populations
experiencing high mortality, many marriages will be interrupted before the end
of the reproductive period and many individuals will be unable to find new mates.
This frequent truncation of the reproductive period, together with the larger fluctuations in numbers of births and deaths to
be expected under conditions of high fertility and mortality, should result in a
reduced probability of survival for such
populations, i.e., in a larger minimum size.
In populations in which there is no marriage, the effect of fertility and mortality
level on minimum viable size should be
reduced. However, even in the absence of
marriage as a requirement for reproduction, populations experiencing high mortality might be expected to have occasional

gaps in the age distribution and therefore
to require a larger population size in order
to insure survival.

To test these hypotheses, we chose two
levels of fertility and mortality. Level 1E
consisted of Coale and Demeny’s mortality
level 1 East (high mortality) and probabilities of reproducing derived from the
high-fertility broad-peak United Nations
model fertility curve. Level 24W utilized

wCoale and Demeny’s mortality level 24
SWest (low mortality) and the United Nations model fertility curve of the low broad"epeak type. Some characteristics of these

 

fertility and mortality patterns are shown
in Table 1.

For each of the six combinations of fertility-mortality and mating patterns, three
(and, in one case, four) initia] population
sizes were selected, and for each of the
nineteen sets of conditions, ten replicates
were made. Initial populations had equal
numbers of males and females. Table 2
lists the initial population sizes chosen for
each set of demographic conditions. Our
objective was to determine, for each of the
six fertility-mortality-mating combinations,
how large a population had to be in order

to have a high probability of surviving. The
decision to do only ten replicates for each
set of conditions was based primarily upon
cost. In earlier experiments performed for
the purpose of estimating population growth
rates, we found that very little precision
was gained by increasing the number of
replicates beyond ten (Dyke and MacCluer,

MacCluer and Dyke

Social Biology

1973; Dyke, 1974). However, it would obviously be desirable to increase the number
of replicates in order to get more accurate
estimates of probability of population survival.

RESULTS

Table 3 shows mean population size and
average yearly growth rate across ten replicates at the end of two hundred years for
each set of demographic conditions. Several
trends can be observed. First, as initial size
decreases under a given set of fertilitymortality-mating conditions, there is a general tendency for growth rate to decrease.
Second, as mating rules become more strict,
populations have greater difficulty in maintaining their initial sizes. Monogamous
populations have considerably lower growth
rates than corresponding populations with
no marriage. The prohibition of marriage
between first cousins produces only a slight
dampening of population growth. (This

prohibition might be expected to have more
serious consequences, however, in a population whose structure resulted in large numbers of first cousins per individual [see, for
example, MacCluer et al., 1971].) Third,
monogamy is much more effective in dampening population growth when fertility and
mortality are high than when they are low.
As mentioned above, this result is to be
expected because of the more frequent interruption of marriages in high mortality
populations. Finally, populations experiencing low fertility and mortality seem to be
better able to survive than populations of
identical mating pattern and initial size but
with high fertility and mortality. Because
of the approximations necessary in developing age-specific birth rates for the two
types of populations, caution should be
used in making such comparisons between
them. However, some possible explanations
for the differences in survival will be presented later.

In order to get some estimate of the
probability of population survival, we calculated for each population type the proportion of runs in which population size at
the end of two hundred years was greater
than or equal to some specified fraction of
the initial size. The choice of that fraction
is rather arbitrary since different investigators are likely to have different criteria for
judging population success. We have tabulated P(Noo9 & &:No) for values of & equal
to 0.5, 0.8, 1, and 1.2 (see Table 4). Since
each calculation was based upon only ten
simulation runs, the figures are only approximate.

To summarize the results shown in Tables 3 and 4, even a population which adheres to strict monogamy can survive with
complete endogamy for a_ considerable
period of time with fewer than three hundred individuals, especially if mortality is
low enough that few marriages are terminated during the reproductive period. On

the other hand, if there are mechanisms
which insure that women remain in the reproductive pool for a large portion of their
adult lives (for example, polygyny or acceptance of extramarital pregnancy), then
the minimum viable size of a population
might be as low as fifty to one hundred
individuals.

Our next task was to determine which of
a selected set of demographic characteristics
were most sensitive to decreases in population size. The parameters which we examined were mean age at first marriage for

males and females, age difference between
spouses at first marriage, mean ages at maternity and paternity, mean interval between births in populations with marriage,
and completed family size for women who
survived to age 40. Because of technical
problems, it was not possible to calculate
mean interval between births in populations
with no marriage. It was expected that as
initial population size was reduced and the
level of fertility and mortality was held
constant, both males and females would
have greater difficulty in finding mates,
thus increasing mean age at first marriage
for both sexes and probably increasing the
age difference between spouses. As a consequence, mean ages at maternity and paternity and mean birth interval should
increase, while mean completed family size
would be expected to decrease.
Examination of Tables 5 to 8 reveals
that these predictions are indeed borne out.
However, some of the parameters listed are
much more heavily influenced than others
by reductions in initial population size. In

Social Biology

particular, in the smaller populations there
is a marked increase in age at first marriage
for males and a pronounced decrease in
completed family size.

Some comparisons were also possible between sets of populations with strict monogamy and sets with the same fertility
and mortality rates and initial sizes but
with no marriage. The effect of requiring
matriage for reproduction will be to delay
or prevent childbearing for some women.
Therefore, mean ages at maternity and paternity should be higher in monogamous
populations and completed family sizes
should be smaller. Mean ages at maternity
as shown in Table 6 were in general agreement with expectation although the magnitude of the difference was not large.

Without marriage, age difference between
parents is likely to increase with a woman’s
parity, whereas it remains fixed in a monogamous population. Consequently, we
have not compared the two processes of
mate choice with respect to age at paternity. The most striking difference between

monogamous populations and those with no
marriage was in mean completed family
size (Table 8). Both in total births and in
offspring surviving to maturity, monogamous populations consistently had smaller
completed family sizes than did populations
with no marriage, and the effect was especially strong in small populations. It can
also be seen that whereas the high-fertility
populations had a larger number of total

births per female than did the low-fertility
populations, the difference is considerably
reduced when numbers of surviving offspring are compared.

The demographic consequences of avoidance of first cousin marriage may also be
seen in Tables 5 to 8. The expected effect
of such a restriction on mate choice is that
some individuals will have to postpone marriage and childbearing. As a result, there
will be an increase in mean ages at first
marriage for both males and females and
in mean age difference between spouses;
mean ages at maternity and paternity will
increase; mean completed family size will
be reduced; and mean birth interval will be
longer. These expectations are for the most
part borne out as shown in Tables 5 to 8.
As expected, the effect is most pronounced
in small populations, in which a larger proportion of an individual’s potential mates
are likely to be first cousins.

to 8 is that avoidance of first cousin mar
riage has more serious demographic conse
quences in populations with low than in
those with high fertility and mortality. The
reason for this rather striking difference
between populations at different fertility
and mortality levels can perhaps best be
understood by considering the expected age
difference between pairs of first cousins in
two types of populations:

I. A population in which each couple has
exactly two offspring, both of whom
survive to maturity, and with a mean
age difference between sibs of five
years. .

II. A population in which each couple has
six offspring, with a mean interval of
three years between successive births,
but with only two of the six offspring
surviving to maturity.

These two populations correspond
roughly to the low (I) and high (II) fertility and mortality populations which were
simulated. It can be shown that in Popula
 

 

tion I, the mean age difference between sibs
is five years, while in Population II, the
mean age difference between the two surviving sibs is seven years. There will be a
correspondingly greater variance in age difference between first cousins in this highfertility, high-mortality population, such
that many opposite-sex first cousins will
differ too greatly in age to be eligible for
marriage at the same time. Therefore, prohibition of first cousin marriages in Population II will remove relatively fewer
individuals from a person’s pool of potential mates, and the consequences for demographic structure will be less severe.

We are now attempting to develop means
for predicting population survival. We are
comparing pairs of simulations generated
under identical initial conditions and according to identical rules, but in which one
of the two populations has increased in size
and the other has decreased and eventually

become extinct. In some cases in which two
populations are similar in size for a portion
of their histories, it is apparent from an
examination of the population pyramids
that one of them has large gaps in its age
distribution which eventually lead to a decrease in the numbers of marriages and
births. For other pairs of simulations, no
such obvious differences in population
structure exist until the population sizes
have begun to diverge. Among the indices
of population “survivability” which we are
examining are: (1) an age stability index,

sS= y Daa. o)?,

where a; is the observed number of individuals of one sex in a given age class and a,
is the number expected on the basis of the
stable age distribution (this index is simiJar to one used by King and Anderson,
1974); (2) mean reproductive value
(Fisher, 1958); (3) reproductive span for
females; and (4) potential mates analysis
(Dyke, 1971), in which the numbers of
potential mates are tabulated through time
for both sexes by age and family relationship.

CONCLUSIONS

We suggest that under a range of constant demographic conditions, endogamous
human populations may have a high probability of survival even if they consist of as
few as one hundred to two hundred individuals, These estimates were made on the
assumption that chance fluctuations in
numbers of births, deaths, and available
mates are the primary determinants of
minimum viable size. If political, economic,
or sociological factors (such as division of
labor or defense of territory) are taken into
account, the minimum viable size will probably be higher. Therefore, it would be
reasonable to question whether a real population which survives for any length of

Minimum Population Size Il

time with fewer than one hundred individuals is truly endogamous.

Populations experiencing low fertility
and mortality might be expected to have
higher survival rates than do those of identical size and mating structure, but with
high fertility and mortality. This conclusion, which is supported by the simulation
results, is based upon the larger temporal
fluctuations to be expected when birth and
death rates are high. It has also been possible to quantify by simulation the extent
to which minimum size is increased by imposing more stringent conditions on a female’s entry into the pool of those eligible
to reproduce. Under the strictest mating
rules examined, i.e., strict monogamy with
prohibition of matings between individuals
related as closely as first cousins, the populations which suffered most were those with
low fertility and mortality, because these
were the populations in which the greatest
number of potential mates were biologically
related. Although the present study was not
concerned with populations in which some
type of consanguineous mating is preferred,
our results imply that such a system of
mate preference will be only marginally
successful if fertility and mortality rates
are high,

For a number of other parameters not
considered here, the effect on minimum
viable size may be predicted in a general
way. Any factor which increases the proportion of individuals without mates (for
example, divorce or late marriage) will increase minimum viable size. Clan or lineage
structure, if it significantly restricts each
individual’s pool of potential mates, will
increase minimum size. On the other hand,
if there are many clans and only members
of one’s own clan are prohibited as mates,
the effect on minimum size might be negligible. Polygyny will increase the likelihood of survival of small populations since
it reduces the proportion of females without

mates. Polyandry might actually decrease
the probability of survival (and increase
minimum viable size) if the available men
in the population are distributed among
only a few women.

Comparison of some of the demographic
characteristics of populations which survive
with those of populations which do not reveals that some measures are much better
than others as indicators of a population’s
potential for survival. Our results suggest
that an increase in age at marriage may be
an important predictor of population decline. Other parameters such as completed

family size also change noticeably in declining populations, but there is probably
a considerable time lag between the initiation of events which lead to ultimate population decline and the reduction in mean
completed family size.
