Behavioral Genetics

 

Proposed Organization of an Association of

Behavioral Genetics

At the 1967 Princeton Conference on
Population Genetics and Demography an
interested group of participants discussed
informally the possible organization of an
Association of Behavioral Genetics.

The Consensus: Such an association could
benefit the growth of this field if it promoted
communication between the various areas of
interest at this early stage of its development,
thereby forestalling a premature isolation of
specializations. The aim of the association
should be to bring together the active workers
in both animal and human behavior (normal
and abnormal) and theorists in anthropology,
ecology, evolutionary biology, and psychol
ogy.

To determine the opinion of active workers in different aspects of behavioral genetics
a ballot was circulated to 59 persons chosen
to represent the various areas of interest.
The poll was not an attempt to contact all
persons interested in behavioral genetics,
but merely an attempt to obtain opinions
from representatives of different areas of
the field.

The results of the ballot are as follows:

I favor the organization of an Association of
Behavioral Genetics.

Yes 44 Nol

I agree with the general basis for organization

of an association as outlined in the accompanying communication.

Yes 44 Nol
I would consider giving support to an organi
zation stemming from the present organization effort.

Yes 44 Nol

Opinion was overwhelmingly in favor of
the formation of an organization to represent behavioral genetics. Comments and
suggestion most frequently offered by respondents were: an international membership, an early dissemination of information,
and solicitation of support from as large a
group of interested persons as possible. A
number of persons appended lists of names
and addresses to their ballots, Further suggestions of names (including addresses) of
persons to be placed on a mailing list may
be sent to:

Dr. Richard Osborne

Box U154

University of Connecticut,
Storrs, Connecticut 06268

Plans for the initial stage of organization
of an Association of Behavioral Genetics
will be announced in the December issue of
Sociol Biology.
