ABSTRACT: Some demographers have argued that post-World War II mortality declines in the lessdeveloped countries (LDC’s) are not associated with economic and social development because of
the diffusion of health and medical techniques from the developed to the underdeveloped countries.
This paper examines the current relationship between socioeconomic development and mortality
levels in 124 countries, 94 of which are LDC’s. The argument is tested with a path model consisting
of five multidimensional and three unidimensional indicators. Results indicate that for the LDC’s,
there is a very strong set of direct and indirect relationships between indicators of socioeconomic
development and mortality. Between 62 and 80 per cent of the variances in the crude death rate,
infant mortality, and life expectancy are explained in the LDC model. The empirical test of the
model demonstrates that lower mortality levels in the LDC’s are dependent on socioeconomic factors and health services; continued improvement of socioeconomic levels in the LDC’s will result in
further mortality declines. For comparative purposes, the same model also is tested for more developed countries. Results for the model with more developed countries (MDC’s) show that entirely
different measures are necessary for MDC mortality models; the concept of ‘‘mortality” for LDC’s

and MDC’s is orthogonal and requires different empirical indicators.

The large mortality declines experienced during the past few centuries by
what now are regarded as the developed
countries usually are attributed to the interactive effects of socioeconomic development and the many advances in medicine and public health. Both health and
medical technology and socioeconomic
development (primarily income-related
factors) worked together to produce declines in mortality (infant/child and
general) and increases in life expectancy.

In recent years some demographers
have argued that the rapid mortality declines experienced by the less-developed
countries (LDC’s), especially since World
War II, are disassociated from social and
economic development because of the diffusion of vast amounts of health and medical techniques and information from the
developed countries to the LDC’s (Coale,

1973; Stolnitz, 1955, 1956, 1965; Petersen,
1975; Demerath, 1976; Wrong, 1977; see
also Schultz, 1976). Goldscheider (1971,
pp. 116-117), for example, argues that the
independence of social and economic development from rapid mortality declines
has characterized LDC’s since the 1930's.

It often then is postulated that the
clear-cut one-to-one relationship between
socioeconomic improvement and mortality reduction no longer is observable, but
research has produced mixed results (c.f.
Gray, 1974; Adelman, 1963). The policy
implications of this possibility, given the
known linkages between socioeconomic
development and fertility, and between
fertility and mortality, in the LDC’s (c.f.
Chang et al., 1979; Ridker, 1976; Heer,
1966; Adelman and Morris, 1966) are
enormous and serious if the question of

cioeconomic development is in contributing to mortality declines in the LDC’s is
not explored (c.f. Schultz, 1976). While
socioeconomic development and mortality declines may have been relatively independent of one another earlier this century, does this independence persist
today? Have LDC mortality rates declined to a point where future reductions
may be dependent upon social and
economic development in addition to the
diffusion of health and medical technologies (c.f. Fuchs, 1976, cited in Schultz,
1976)? To this end, the purpose of this
brief study is to investigate the relative importance that socioeconomic development and health services have for recent
mortality levels in LDC’s. A relative comparison is made to more-developed countries (MDC’s) to clarify the differences
that exist and examine commonalities in
mortality determinants these two country
groupings may share. A path model of factors affecting mortality is described below
and tested with a sample of 94 LDC’s and
again for 30 MDC’s.

THE MORTALITY MODEL

Figure 1 illustrates a brief theoretical
model of causal relationships between socioeconomic improvement variables and
mortality. It is proposed that socioeconomic factors will have definable effects on LDC mortality levels. These effects will be shown by significant networks
in the proposed model.

Five multidimensional and unidimensional variables are selected as determinants of mortality. Economic development and educational level are proposed
as exogenous variables. Living standards,
health services and nutritional diet are
proposed as endogenous variables. The
measurement and expected signs of relationships among variables are described
below. Similar linkages are described in

Mortality Levels 221

greater theoretical detail by Goldscheider
(1971) and Chang et al. (1979)

Economic DEVELOPMENT (ECON)

Economic development, or industrialization, has been a major factor related to
declines in crude death rates and infant
mortality rates and increases in life expectancy (Goldscheider, 1971). Measured
in this study by energy and newsprint consumption, economic development is expected to relate negatively to crude death
rates (CDR’s) and infant mortality rates
(IMR’s), and positively to life expectancy.
It also is expected that economic development will relate positively to health services, living standard, and diet and nutrition (Berg, 1973; McIntosh, 1975;
Turnham, 1971).

EpucaTION (EDUC)

Education, a major socioeconomic indicator, is a major mortality inhibitor. It is
expected, like economic development, to
be negatively related to CDR’s and
IMR’s, and positively to life expectancy
(c.f., Chang and Pendleton, 1978). Education then is expected to be positively related to living standards, health services
(Chang, et al., 1979; Chang and Pendleton 1978), and diet nutrition (McIntosh,
1975). Education is measured unidimensionally as the per cent of adults in the
country who are literate.

LIVING STANDARD (LIVI)

The living standard of the country is
reflected by the composite of the number
of radio receivers per thousand members
of the population and the number of telephones per thousand members of the population. It is expected to be positively related to health services and diet and
nutrition. Living standard should be negatively related to the general and infant
measures of mortality, and positively related to life expectancy. |

HEALTH SERVICES (HEAL)

Measured by the combination of population per bed and population per physician, better health services should reduce
infant and general mortality and increase
life expectancy (Kusukawa, 1967;
Eldridge, 1952; United Nations, 1963).
According to some scholars, health services should be of much greater importance
than indicators of socioeconomic development (economic development, education,
living standard, and diet and nutrition) in
determining indicators of mortality (crude
death rates, infant mortality rates, and life
expectancy).

Diet AND Nutrition (DIET)

Malnutrition was an associated or underlying cause of 57 per cent of the child
mortality in thirteen Latin American
countries (World Health Organization,
1974). Improving diet supplementation
programs significantly reduced child mortality in Peru (Baertl et al., 1970).

Diet and nutrition, measured here as a
composite consisting of average calorie intake, per cent animal origin from calories,
and per capita intake of protein, also has
been found to play an intervening role between education and mortality (c.f. Bengoa, 1974; Friedlander and Silver, 1967).
It is expected to have a positive effect on
life expectancy.

MORTALITY

Three separate measures of mortality
are used: crude death rates (CDR), infant
mortality rates (IMR), and life expectancy
at birth (LE). Although other studies
(Preston, 1975; Fredricksen, 1968) have
used only one variable to measure mortality levels (e.g., death rate, life expectancy) three measures will be used in this
study to compensate for the weakness of
using any single variable alone, such as the

Social Biology

crude death rate. The three measures are
purposefully not summarized as a single
variable to retain the policy commitment
of this research.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data for 124 countries were collected
for the analysis; 94 are LDC’s and 30 are
MDC’s. The countries are listed in Table

Path analysis was performed to test the
direct and indirect relationships among
the variables in the proposed model as
shown in Figure 1. Standard least-squares
multiple regression analyses with pairwise
deletion were made of the proposed
linkages in the path model. Significance
was found when the standardized
coefficient was at least twice its standard
error. Insignificant paths were dropped
and the model then was retested (Duncan,
1966). This was done for the model with
the LDC sample (N=94) and with the
more developed countries (NV = 30). Table
2 provides a summary of the variables and
dates and sources of data. Data are mostly
from the mid-1970’s.

A direct comparison of the variables
which consist of different measurement
would be misleading. Therefore, z-scores
were computed for every variable before
conducting the path analysis. The formula
for z-score transformation is

X-X

where the mean of each variable is subtracted from each observation for that varlable, then divided by the variable’s standard deviation, and summed for all
observations. The z-scores for each variable then are added together and divided
by the number of variables used in constructing the scale to form a single value
for each country. Scales were constructed
for economic development, living stand

ard, health services, diet and nutrition,
and life expectancy. The three unidimensional concepts are education, crude
death rates, and infant mortality rates.

RESULTS

The zero order correlation matrix for
LDC’s is shown in Table 3. All of the independent variables are significantly associated with the dependent variables in the
expected directions. Knowledge of these
bivariate correlations, however, cannot
fully explain or document the effects of
the socioeconomic and health service variables on the three measures of mortality.
Ordinary least squares regression equa
tions were constructed as described earlier
in Figure 1 and used to examine the path
network. Displayed in Figure 2 and detailed in Table 4 are the results for the revised mortality model when applied to
LDC’s.

Of the 23 described paths (Figure 2), 12
are significant. Of these 12 significant
paths, 11 are in the expected direction.
Somewhat surprising is the positive effect
diet has on the CDR (B=0.22). This is,
however, the second smallest coefficient.

Examining the relationships among social improvement variables, significant results have emerged. Economic development has a positive effect on living
standards (B=0.30). Higher educational

health service, living standards, nutritional diet, and educational level. Sixtytwo per cent and 80 per cent of the variances in infant mortality rate and life

living standards and education.

As indicated by the correlation

the others relate; they provide an environment for each other.

Results found when the mortality

standards (r= —0.18) but not significant.
Associated with infant mortality and life
expectancy are economic development,

DISCUSSION

The LDC’s model indicates that crude
death rates are associated directly with
educational level, health services, living
standard and nutritional diet; infant mortality and life expectancy are influenced
directly by living standards and education.
Economic development is the only variable in the model that does not show any
direct relation with mortality. Its indirect
effect, however, is exerted on mortality
through living standards.

These significant results in the path
model indicate that, for LDC’s, social and

economic development is necessary for
better mortality conditions. The argument
that mortality levels remain independent
of socioeconomic advances in LDC’s does
not withstand an empirical test. Some earlier research using different measurements of socioeconomic conditions support our finding. Preston (1975), for
example, suggested a change in mortality
in LDC’s had occurred in the relation between mortality and national income. Fredriksen (1971) provided evidence that
economic development, by increasing per
capita food consumption, was an important cause of the observed mortality decline in Ceylon after World War II.

Although mortality declines may have
occurred independent of socioeconomic
advancement in the past, as some researchers have earlier posited, such independence no longer is an accurate concept
of what factors affect current LDC mortality.

Nutrition and diet has an unexpected
positive effect on the crude death rate; it
has no effect on infant mortality and life
expectancy. It probably implies that in
LDC’s, nutritional status is not determined exclusively by diet, nor is diet determined by the availability of calories of
protein (Preston, 1976, p. 13). Other factors, such as infectious diseases, have to
be taken into account as sources of malnourishment. Gordon (1969, p. 218) sug
gests that diet alone does not fully explain
the prevalent malnourishment in LDC’s.
Daily calorie consumption was found to
have an insignificant effect on mortality in
LDC’s between 1940 and 1970 (Preston,
1976). The positive effect found of nutrition on crude death rates in this study suggests that further scrutiny of the relationship between nutrition and mortality is
needed.

The proposed directional paths did not
develop in MDC’s in the present research.
It seems, as would be expected, that mortality in MDC’s is a phenomenon totally
different from mortality in LDC’s. Our
measurement of socioeconomic development in LDC’s includes variables like
energy and newsprint consumption, adult
literacy, radios and telephones, bed and
physician availability, and calorie and protein intake. While variability in these still
is extreme in many LDC’s, most MDC’s
find most all adults to be minimally literate
and eating relatively well, most all households containing radios, telephones, minimally acceptable levels of health care, and
so on. In other words, ‘“‘development”’ in
the MDC’s should tap into the quality of
what these concepts include as well as the
quantity. Simple bed and physician availability, for example, is a sufficient health
technology indicator in LDC’s, but an
MDC health concept would need to know
the quality of medical and health care,

e.g., nursing staffs, health costs, equipment and physician/technician sophistication, ambulatory services, etc. So, although there are relational values among
variables in the mortality model for
MDC’s, the search for causal linkages in
an MDC mortality model would require
measurement of a very different nature.
