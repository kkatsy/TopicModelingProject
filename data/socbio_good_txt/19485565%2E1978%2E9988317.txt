The Biocultural Pattern of
Japanese-American Fertility

ABSTRACT: A comparison of age-specific fertility data on second-generation Japanese-American
women with published data on modern and premodern women in Japan and with data on modern
U.S. white women shows the persistence of a fertility pattern among all Japanese groups. This
pattern is significantly different from that of U.S. whites. It appears that continuity in certain
family and kinship elements has played a central role in the persistence of this pattern. In
addition, it is suggested that the introduction of modern contraceptive techniques may have the
consequence of merely intensifying a cultural pattern of fertility, rather than changing its basic

outlines.

The biological process of human reprodeduction would appear to be greatly influenced by the sociocultural context in
which it occurs. Sociocultural influences
may work directly or indirectly and may
or may not be apparent to the persons
involved. According to Davis and Blake
(1956), such influences may affect the process of reproduction during any or all of its
three stages of intercourse, conception,
and gestation-parturition. Fertility, then,
may be viewed as a biocultural phenomenon resulting from interactions between
biological and sociocultural processes.

In studying fertility as a biocultural
phenomenon, it would seem appropriate
to view it over time in order to delineate
the dynamics of the biological and sociocultural interactions involved. First
of all, sociocultural influences interact
with the age-related physiological capacity
to reproduce and result in age patterns of
fertility which differ among different cultures and societies. Second, within a historical framework, the different age patterns of fertility may show change or continuity within particular sociocultural

traditions. In the special case of migrant
groups, biological and sociocultural interactions may be even more clearly revealed since change or continuity in fertility patterns over time may be dependent
upon conditions which affect the continuation of traditional cultural practices in
new environments. The purpose of the
present paper is to discuss the presence
and persistence of a particular age pattern of fertility among second-generation
Japanese-American women which can be
traced back to premodern Japan.

The existence of a variety of age patterns of fertility among different societies
has been documented by a United Nations
study (1965) using data from 72 countries.
U.N. population researchers describe differences among age patterns in terms of
their peak age periods of fertility which
are graphically shown in age curves of
fertility. Three major types of patterns are
defined: an “early peak” type with maximum fertility in the age group 20 to 24
years; a “late peak” type with maximum
fertility in the age group 25 to 29 years;
and a “broad peak” type with maximum

fertility about equally divided between
these two age groups.

Given both the biological constraints
on fertility and this simple three-way
classification system, the differences one
may describe between age patterns of fertility are limited. Obviously, similar sets of
sociocultural influences would be expected
to produce similar patterns. It would seem
possible that differing sets of sociocultural
influences could also produce similar patterns. Indeed, while the U.N. researchers
found a similarity between fertility patterns within geographical/cultural regions,
they discovered that geographically-separated and different cultures also could
produce similar patterns.

Although these findings make it impossible to point out a direct correlation between a culture and a specific fertility pattern, they still suggest the variable
influences of different sets of sociocultural
factors on fertility. These influences are
interestingly apparent in the U.N. finding
that no correlation exists between the type
of peak and the degree of economic development or level of fertility among the 72
nations. Economically developed lowfertility countries fall into all three “peak”
categories. Since it may be assumed that
modern contraceptive practices are responsible for the low fertility, it is apparent that these practices have not yet
brought about a single modern pattern of
age-specific fertility.

Historical comparisons of modern with
premodern fertility have sometimes indicated more continuity and stability in fertility variables than might have been predicted, given the dramatic vital revolution
described by the demographic transition
model (Blacker, 1947; Davis, 1963;
Freedman, 1965; Notestein, 1952). For
example, Hajnal (1965) reports that a late
age at marriage has characterized Western
Europe for the last two hundred years;
Pakrasi and Malakar (1973) document the

persistence of a traditional family building
pattern (specifically, short marriage-tofirst-birth intervals) among high-status
well-educated couples in Calcutta in the
early 1970’s. The persistence of such fertility pattern elements in the face of economic development and reduction in fertility levels would seem to reflect continuity in the play of particular sociocultural forces on the childbearing processes.
In the case of Japan, Hanley (1972,
1974) argues that fertility in Japan has not
changed substantially since the premodern
period of the 1700’s and 1800’s! (the late
Tokugawa and early Meiji periods). Hanley has used records? from four Japanese
villages which, combined, span the period
1683 to 1871 to reconstruct elements of the
premodern fertility pattern. The modal
age group for childbearing was 25 to 29
years, resulting in a “late-peak” age pattern of fertility. A high average age at
marriage, consistently exceeding age 22
over all historical periods and for all villages, was the apparent determinant of
this late-peak pattern. Furthermore, the
average age at last birth was about 36
years. A short childbearing span resulted,
and the mean completed family size was
small, averaging three to four children.
Late average age at marriage along with
divorce and widowhood acted to restrict
mean completed family size in premodern
Japan. Beyond these effects there is also
evidence for some control of family size

1 There is some discrepancy between the official
statistics which indicate a rise in birth rates in association with a constant death rate (Taeuber, 1958)
and the revisions made by Morita (1963) indicating a
constant birth rate in association with a declining
death rate. In either case, it is agreed that no dramatic changes have taken place in Japan’s demographic patterns during its transition into a modern
industrialized state. Certainly, population growth
rates were relatively low in early Japan compared to
those found in many underdeveloped countries to
ay.

These records are in the form of religious investigation records (shuman-aratame-cho) begun in the
seventeenth century and designed to control the
spread of Christianity in Japan.

through abortion and infanticide. Hanley’s analysis of the sex ratios of last-born
children shows a Statistically significant
prevalence of male children, indicating
possible preferential infanticide against
females (1972, p. 528-530). Further evidence for these practices from rural population records includes the existence of a
long period (eight or nine years) between
the birth of the last child (at about age 36)
and the end of the childbearing period
(about age 45) for those women married
throughout these years.

A “late-peak” fertility pattern, resulting at least in part from identifiable sociocultural practices, was thus established
in premodern Japan. This “late-peak”
pattern persists in modern Japan and, as
this paper will show, among secondgeneration Japanese-American women.
The presence and persistence of this biocultural pattern of fertility will be shown by (1)
outlining the characteristics of the fertility
of second-generation Japanese Americans,
(2) showing the basic differences between
Japanese-American fertility and U.S. white
fertility, and (3) demonstrating the con
tinuity in fertility patterns of women in
premodern Japan and modern Japan and of
Japanese-American women.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Age-specific fertility rates (ASFR)* and
per cent distributions of births by age are
used to describe the fertility patterns of
Japanese-American, U.S. white, modern
Japanese, and premodern Japanese women (see Table 1) and to draw comparisons
among them.

The fertility data for JapaneseAmerican women are derived from a survey questionnaire administered in interviews with 94 second-generation women
born between 1910 and 1934 and presently
living in or near Seattle, Washington. The
genealogical design of the interview
schedule allowed the collection of demographic data on an extended set of relatives
including the informant, her sisters, and

3 For a one-year period, the age-specific fertility
rate (ASFR) is calculated as ASFR = (births to
women of age X,)/(female population of age X,) for
the six five-year age groups (X; to X,) between the
ages of 15 and 44.

her spouse’s sisters. Complete reproductive histories (including only live births)
were collected on a total sample of 166
women. The reproductive years of these
women span a long time period, from 1925
to 1975. However, their fertility is mostly
concentrated in the years from 1935 to
1965.

The fertility data on U.S. white women
are for 1950 and 1960 and are taken from
national vital statistical records (National
Center for Health Statistics, 1977, Table
1-6). The 1950 rates for women in modern
Japan come from Taeuber (1958, p. 236),
and the 1960 rates come from the United
Nations study discussed above (United
Nations, 1965, p. 103). Hanley’s (1974, p.
135) data were used to calculate premodern age-specific fertility rates. The
number of births to women in each fiveyear age period between 15 and 49 years
for four villages during various time periods in the 1600’s, 1700’s, and 1800’s provide the relative incidence of births during
each age period. The average completed
family size for this premodern period has
been estimated by Hanley (1974) and
Hayami (1968, cited in Hanley, 1974) to
have been approximately 3.5 children. If
this number (3.5) is used as an estimate of
the total fertility rate (TFR),* estimated
age-specific fertility rates can be derived
by multiplying the percentage of all births
in each age period by 3.5 and then dividing by five to determine a yearly average
ASFR for each five-year period.

The sets of data are not strictly comparable. The figures for Japanese-American
fertility are based on actual cohort data.
Each age-specific fertility rate given is the
mean rate for the five five-year secondgeneration cohorts born between 1910 and

* The total fertility rate (TFR) is the sum of the
age-specific fertility rates (multiplied by five for the
five years represented by each rate). It calculates the
total births per woman which would result if a cohort
of women were to follow a schedule of births represented by the age-specific birth rates.

1934. The same women are therefore represented in each rate. The rates given for
the U.S. white and modern Japanese
women assume a hypothetical cohort (i.e.,
one year’s fertility performance by women
of all ages 1s treated as though experienced
by one group of women over their entire
reproductive lifetime). Thus, each rate
given actually represents the fertility experience of a different group of women.
To compensate for this problem, two sets
of data from 1950 and 1960 are given for
both the United States and modern Japan
in order to characterize better the range in
fertility rates which is not represented in
the fertility experience of one year. Finally, the rates for women in premodern
Japan are estimated from the fertility experience of a number of different women
living at different times.

RESULTS

The Japanese-American age-specific
fertility rates reveal a pattern which may
be described as belonging to the “latepeak” fertility pattern (Figure 1) with the
greatest concentration of births in the age
period 25-29 years. Fertility in the following age period (30-34 years) is higher than
that in the younger age period (20-24
years) preceding the “peak” age period.
Fertility in the age group 15-19 years is
extremely low. A late start in childbearing
is coupled with curtailment of births after
age 35, producing a concentrated pattern
of reproduction between the ages of 20 to
34 years. The average second-generation
pattern just described is also consistently
apparent in the fertility of each of its constituent five main birth cohorts (Figure 2).
Each displays a low rate in the 15-19 age
period and a late peak. Differences among
these curves may be explained by the differing historical circumstances experienced by the cohorts (Leonetti, 1976).

fertility pattern with the other Japanese
patterns shows that the premodern curve
parallels the fertility curves of modern
Japanese women. However, the premodern curve displays a broader distribution of births throughout the childbearing
years than do the modern curves.

 

The relationship between the Japanese
curves is even more clearly shown in Figure 5 where the per cent distribution of
total fertility attributed to each age period
is plotted. Again, the relative lack of concentration of births in the peak age period
in premodern Japan is evident. Fertility

change from the premodern to the 1950
curve to the 1960 curve involves an increasing concentration of births in the
peak fertility period (ages 25-29 years). A
progressive decline in reproduction after
age 35 years also occurs from premodern
to modern times. Modern Japan as of 1960
is remarkable among all nations in the
extraordinary concentration of fertility in
the age period 25-29 and the very low
level of fertility in the 15-19 age period
(United Nations, 1965). The JapaneseAmerican per cent distribution curve is
intermediate between the 1950 and 1960
Japanese curves> in its concentration of
births. In this figure, continuity of what
may be called the “Japanese” fertility pattern from premodern to modern Japanese
and Japanese-American women is evident.

DISCUSSION

From these results, second-generation
Japanese-American fertility appears to belong within a manifestation of cultural
succession. The fertility pattern of these
women has been shown to have distinctive
characteristics which differentiate it from
that of contemporary U.S. white women.
On the other hand, striking similarities exist between the fertility patterns
of second-generation Japanese-American
women and those of modern Japanese
women. Furthermore, these modern Japanese patterns appear to have developed
directly out of the fertility patterns of
premodern Japan. The increasing concentration of reproduction at the peak period
accompanied by its reduction after age 35
appears as a secular trend of fertility
change which occurs within a basic pattern continuity.

5 The high percentage of births in the JapaneseAmerican pattern at ages 30-34 years may have resulted from historical factors (including the World

War II relocation of West Coast Japanese-Americans) which brought about delays of births in

‘some second-generation cohorts (Leonetti, 1976).

Japanese-American Fertility

 

 

47

The progression from a broad distribution of births in premodern Japan to a
natrow distribution in modern Japan is
due to increasing control over reproduction through modern techniques of contraception and abortion (Miyamoto, 1973;
Muramatsu, 1960). The use of modern
contraceptives is, of course, a cultural
practice and is a modern addition to other
more traditional cultural practices modifying directly and indirectly the level and
pattern of fertility in a population.

It is suggested here that contraceptive
practices have been used to bring under
further control a society’s fertility while at
the same time preserving its essential pattern characteristics. Furthermore, it is assumed here that these techniques would be
used in a conscious effort to follow a culturally acceptable family-building model.
The cultural processes from which this
model is derived, however, may remain
traditional and, of course, exceedingly
complex in nature.

In the case of both Japanese and
Japanese-American women, modern alterations in their fertility patterns primarily
involve the retention or intensification of
characteristics established in the premodern period. The modal age period of
25-29 years remains, but the concentration of births in this peak fertility period
has been accentuated in the modern patterns. Fertility in the 15-19 age period was
low in premodern times and has been further reduced in recent years. These observations of historical modifications of the
“Japanese” biocultural pattern of fertility
point to the importance of understanding
contraceptive use within the context of the
traditional fertility pattern.

The age-specific fertility patterns of
other present-day low-fertility countries
may also be viewed as traditional patterns
brought under control by contraceptive
practices. In the United Nations (1965)
study, patterns of low-fertility countries
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

AS Leonetti

are shown to fall into all three “peak” categories. The process of effective fertility
reduction through the use of modern contraceptives thus does not appear to destroy
what may be interpreted as their basic
traditional fertility patterns.© The lowfertility countries, however, display less
fertility pattern variability among the fertility patterns in each “peak” category
than do the high-fertility countries. The
great variability among the patterns of the
high-fertility countries within each category may result from a larger variety of
combinations of cultural influences impinging on their fertility curves. Conversely, less variability among the lowfertility patterns may result from the
common contraceptive practices used in
these nations. While contraceptive practices may be used to carry on traditional
patterns, they also appear to create more
similarity among countries with already
similar patterns.

The similarity between all the “Japanese” fertility patterns suggests continuity in the sociocultural context of that
fertility. Furthermore, the cultural continuity reflected in Japanese-American
second-generation fertility calls for an exploration of the processes involved in the
transplantation and preservation of their
cultural heritage by a migrant population.
One approach would be to view sociocultural characteristics as an essential part of
a population’s adaptive strategy within its
environment. The preservation of traditional social (kinship) and economic patterns which took place in the migration
period could be understood in terms of the
adaptive continuity of the sociocultural
context of the fertility patterns.

For example, it has been argued by
Yanagisako (1975a, b) that the widespread

® A statistical by-product of this fertility reduction
process may be the lower variance known to exist
within the age-specific fertility curves of low-fertility
countries (Mitra, 1967).

entry of Japanese immigrants into
family-based business enterprises in the
prewar period allowed the transfer to
America of many traditional Japanese
economic and social patterns which had
been developed in the context of family
farming enterprises in Japan. Consequently, the economic and _ psychological
influences on age at marriage of secondgeneration Japanese-American women
have continued to be similar to those in
Japan. Both groups of women have a late
median age at marriage (over age 23;
Bogue, 1969; Leonetti, 1976) as did premodern Japanese women (over age 22;
Hanley, 1974). In turn, late age at marriage has been one major determinant of
the characteristic and persistent biocultural pattern of fertility found among
premodern Japanese, modern Japanese,
and second-generation Japanese-American women. The similar situation of the
daughters in families both in Japan
and in prewar America as contributors to
the economic welfare of the family unit
may have worked to delay marriages until
ages 22-24 years. A young woman in rural
agricultural Japan or a second-generation
Japanese-American woman rarely left her
parents’ home to live elsewhere before
marriage, remaining a contributor to this
economic unit until she married. The psychological dimension of the resulting intergenerational dependency (noted by Doi,
1973) may also have been important in
delaying age at marriage.

From the work done by Yanagisako
(1975a, b), it seems clear that in the case of
the Japanese-Americans many traditional
family-centered behavior patterns persist
and kin roles and sex roles are wellpreserved, although modified where necessary to fit new situations. Elements of
the roles which were in conflict with the
demands of American life have been sacrificed and the remaining elements reorganized and perpetuated. The implicaDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

tions of this apparent sociocultural continuity on the maintenance of fertility patterns discussed here is undoubtedly great
and deserves further exploration.

It may be argued that the differences
observed between Japanese-American and
U.S. white fertility patterns would disappear if socioeconomic factors were controlled for in the analysis. Since a major
determinant of age patterns of fertility is
age at marriage, comparisons center
around this variable. Mean age at marriage for the Japanese-American women in
the present sample is 24.1 years (Leonetti,
1976), while mean age at marriage for the
same birth cohorts (1910 to 1934) of U.S.
white females is 21.9 years (U.S. Bureau
of the Census, 1972).7 Socioeconomic controls might be first applied by comparing
Japanese-American women with white
American women in similar socioeconomic
circumstances for age at marriage. The
relatively low (although improving) socioeconomic status of second-generation
Japanese-Americans during the 1940’s and
1950’s (Varon, 1967) would require that
they be matched with a _ lower-thanaverage socioeconomic group of white
Americans. Lower socioeconomic status
among white Americans has been associated with a decrease in age at marriage
(U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, 1965). An even earlier age pattern of
childbearing than that found among all
white American women would therefore
be expected in the lower-than-average socloeconomic subgroup. Given such a comparison, the pattern differences would still
be apparent and would probably increase.

However, the low general socioeconomic position of Japanese-Americans
during the 1940’s and 1950's is inconsistent
with their considerable educational at
7 As of 1960, the median age at marriage for similar birth cohorts of Japanese-American women was
23.7 years as reported by the U.S. Bureau of the
Census (1966).

tainment. In Washington State, median
school years completed by JapaneseAmerican females 25 years and over in
1940, 1950, and 1960 were 8.9, 12.2, and
12.3, respectively. The figures for white
females 25 years and over were 10.1, 11.9,
and 12.1 for the same years (Schmid and
Nobbe, 1965). For the present sample
(which excludes older women, _firstgeneration immigrants), the median school
years completed were 13.0 (Leonetti,
1976). Since age at marriage is related to
school years completed (Tietze and
Lauriat, 1955), it might be hypothesized
that the late age at marriage found among
Japanese-American women may be attributable to their educational experience.
This question may be addressed by calculating an “expected” age at marriage for
the Japanese-American women assuming
they experienced the same mean age at
marriage by educational level found
among U.S. white females in 1950. The
year 1950 is chosen because it was central
in the time span of second-generation
Japanese-American marriage activity.
This procedure gives an “expected” mean
age at marriage of 22.1 years for the entire
sample, a full two years below the observed figure of 24.1 years. Therefore, the
comparatively late age at marriage found
among second-generation women cannot
be attributed to differences in education
between the two groups. Rather, the factors responsible for this late age at marriage are to be found within the sociocultural matrix of Japanese-American life.
Finally, the observations presented in
this paper are relevant when interpretations of fertility levels are made.
Japanese-American fertility rates have for
some time been at low levels similar to
those of U.S. white women (Goldscheider
and Uhlenberg, 1969; Thomas, 1950). The
Japanese-American average total fertility
rate (TFR) is estimated to be approximately 2.5 compared with 2.2, 3.0, 3.5

and 2.8, the U.S. white rates for 1940,
1950, 1960 and 1965, respectively (U.S.
National Center for Health Statistics,
1977). However, one cannot assume on
the basis of similar overall levels of fertility and a similar “objective” environment
(the United States) that family-building
processes are also similar for JapaneseAmerican and U.S. white women. In a
simple comparison of overall fertility
rates, the essential differences between the
childbearing patterns of white American
women and second-generation JapaneseAmerican women could easily be overlooked.

One writer, referring to another American ethnic group, stated on the basis of
their small average family size that they
had “unquestionably assimilated to the
patterns of their new environment within
the space of one generation” (Rosenwaike,
1973, p. 280, italics mine). To simply assume a high degree of acculturation on the
basis of similar levels of fertility does not
contribute to an understanding of the
influence of ethnic background on fertility.
Such an interpretation ignores the com

plexity of the family-building process and
the many possible ways in which cultural
(ethnic) influences may act upon it. If we
are to understand fully the biocultural
process of reproduction for both scientific
purposes (e.g., the study of human population ecology) and practical purposes
(e.g., the control of this process), we must
generate an increasingly sophisticated
sociocultural framework for fertility research.
