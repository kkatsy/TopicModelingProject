Differential Fertility in the Arab Republic

of Egypt

Twenty-eight years ago, Clyde V. Kiser
pointed out the significance of the population problem in Egypt with the following
statement: “From the standpoint of size,
Egypt is not one of the critical areas such
as India or China. On the other hand, the
population problem of Egypt epitomizes in
some respects those of the past Mohammedan world and particularly for that reason
is worthy of study” (Kiser, 1944, p. 383).
At that time, the population of Egypt was
slightly over sixteen million. Today, the
population of the Arab Republic of Egypt
(A.R.E.) is more than twice the size it was
when Kiser’s article was published. The
population of the A.R.E. on July 1, 1970,
was Officially estimated at roughly thirtythree million (Central Agency for Public
Mobilization and Statistics, 1971, p. 22).

The published literature on demographic
analyses of the population of the A.R.E. is
extensive (see for instance, Abu-Lughod,
1965; El-Badry, 1955, 1956, and 1965;
Rizk, 1959, 1963; Zikry, 1963, 1964; Hassan and El-Kholy, 1966; Tappozada, 1968;
Central Agency for Public Mobilization and
Statistics, 1966; Abdel-Aty, 1961; Shanawany, 1969; Population Council, 1967;
Ross, 1966; Jones and Mauldin, 1967; ElKmmash, 1968; Issawi, 1963). These anal
 

yses, however, do not possess the specific
qualities of the present analysis which is
unique with regard to its analytical approach.

The purpose of this paper is to study
fertility differentials in the A.R.E. and to
provide a meaningful interpretation of the
observed differentials by occupation of husbands and education of wives. In assuming
this task, the paper sets forth to investigate
the question of whether, and to what extent,
these fertility differentials are genuine or
spurious, and, if genuine, through what
mechanism they operate. In order to achieve
these objectives, the 1960 population data
on reproduction by educational status of
married women, their duration of marriage,
and the occupation of their present husbands are utilized.

The A.R.E. has been taking decennial
population censuses since 1897, the last of
which was taken on September 21, 1960.1
Only two of the seven censuses produced
data that could be utilized for the study of
fertility differentials, namely the censuses
of 1947 and 1960. However, it was the 1960
census that produced, for the first time,

1966 whose detailed returns have not been released because of its dubious quality.

data on fertility by educational status of
married women, the occupation of their
present husband, the duration of current
marriage, and the age of the women.

The major hypothesis of this study is:
If the A.R.E. has entered the second phase
of the demographic transition, there will be
fertility differentials between educated and
uneducated married women, and between
wives whose husbands are engaged in upper
and lower occupational hierarchies (Cowgill, 1949). The analysis is divided into two
major parts, namely, occupational fertility
differentials and educational fertility differentials. Analysis of cohort fertility differentials is added in order to draw some definite
conclusions as to whether the differentials
by occupation and education are being
established.

OCCUPATIONAL FERTILITY
DIFFERENTIALS

Husband’s occupation is one of the important social variables with which fertility
is associated (Campbell, 1959). Table 1
shows that the average number of live
births of Egyptian fertile married women in
1960 increased consistently in each of the
nine major occupational groups as well as

Social Biology

in the “Not classified” and “Not occupied”
cases, as the duration of marriage increased.
For example, women married less than five
years had an average of 1.4 children,
whereas those married thirty or more years
had an average of slightly over 6.9 children,
with the average for all fertile married
women being 4.8 children.

Of the nine major occupational groups,
the wives of sales workers had the largest
average number of children (5.2), followed,
in order, by wives of transportation and
communication workers (5.0); by wives of
service, sport, recreation, and related workers (5.0); by wives of administrative, executive, and managerial workers (4.9); and
by wives of craftsmen, production process
workers, and laborers (4.8). In contrast,
the wives of miners, quarrymen, and related
workers had the smallest average number of
children of all nine known occupational
groups (3.8), followed, in order, by wives
of professional, technical, and related workers (4.3); wives of workers in agriculture,
fishing, hunting, logging, and related activities (4.6); and wives of clerical workers
(4.7).

As seen from Table 1, occupational fertility differentials in the A.R.E. appear to

be inconsistent with generalizations obtained
from other studies (Misra, 1967; Tabah
and Samuel, 1962; Freedman, Whelpton,
and Campbell, 1959, p. 134). The fertility
of women married to one top white-collar
group—administrative, executive, and managerial workers—is higher than the fertility
of wives of farmers, miners, and craftsmen.
On the other hand, the fertility of women
married to one low white-collar group—
sales workers—is higher than the fertility
‘© of wives married to blue-collar workers,
i farmers, and service workers. In general,
& the observed pattern of occupational fertilEity differentials reverses the pattern ob3 served in most other studies, where the
oo fertility of women married to white-collar

< married to workers occupied in other occu"_ pations. This raises two major queries:

the critical value of the F statistic at the
0.1% significance level for 8 to 32 degrees
of freedom (between 4.58 and 4.21). Accordingly, one concludes that the observed
occupational fertility differentials are real.

Identifying occupational fertility differentials as bona fide, one can proceed to
specify the spuriousness or genuineness of

325

the observed inverted differentials. This will
be achieved by adopting a coherent classification of the factors likely to explain the
observed differentials and by providing a
more detailed analysis of the data.

Given the social conditions at the time
the 1960 census was taken, the following
factors could shed light on the origin of the
observed discrepancies.

UNDERREPORTING OF BIRTHS

The estimate of underreporting of births
in the whole country, as given by El-Badry
(1965, p. 145), amounts to about 5%.
Underreporting is said to be higher in rural
areas than in urban areas. Accordingly, one
may reasonably assume that most of the
underenumeration originates primarily from
rural residents. The farmers accounted for
more than 50% of the total population in
1960, which means that the underenumeration of births in this group could lie in the
5% to 10% limit. An adjustment, say of
7.5%, for underenumeration would bring
the average number of children per fertile
married woman from 4.6 to 4.9, a figure
closer to but still below the fertility ratio
observed among sales workers (5.2 children) or transportation and communication
workers (5 children).

MISREPORTING OF BIRTH EVENTS

Other lines of reasoning relate the underreporting of children, especially among
farmers, to memory lapse and to the failure
to report deceased children. In 1960, the
census enumerators interviewed the heads
of the households; when the head was not
present, information for the census schedule
was obtained from another member of the
household. Inaccuracy of enumerators is
confirmed from the large number of “Unstated” (not classified) cases of married
women either by duration of marriage, age,
occupation, or education. For instance, the
total number of “Unstated” married women
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

326 El] Attar

by occupation of husband and duration of
marriage in 1960 was 87,169, or 1.8% of
the total number of married women, and
accounted for 54% of the total number of
“Unstated” cases. The per cent of “Unstated” cases among illiterate and poorly
educated women accounted for 97% of the
total number of “Unstated” cases. Quite

likely, the question on the census schedule .

obtained only the number of children living
on the census date from many respondents
and not the actual number of children who
were born alive. Or, as Barclay (1958,
p. 10) noted, “the live birth may be incorrectly registered as a stillbirth, or as a live
birth with no record of death, or as an
infant death with no record of birth; or
simply not recorded at all, if the child does
not survive long enough to become of much
consequence in the community .... When
a child dies soon after birth, it may be confused with a stillbirth. Even when the facts
are clear, people are fallible.”

Data on stillbirths by father’s occupation
are not available from the A.R.E. vital
statistics. However, the fetal death rates in
1960 were 18.5, 2.7, and 1.2 per 1,000
births for urban localities, rural localities
with health bureaus, and rural localities
without health bureaus, respectively.

DURATION OF MARRIAGE
For a given duration of marriage, the age
at which one enters the reproductive union

 

Social Biology

is naturally of utmost importance as a
factor in the final family size achieved by a
woman. Moreover, memory lapse and the
failure to report deceased children are anticipated to be positively associated with
the age or duration of marriage. Hence, one
would expect the underreporting to increase
with the duration of marriage. Under this
condition, the ratio of the fertility rate of
farmers (suspected of strong underreporting) to the fertility rate of sales and transportation and communication workers (assumed to have more complete reporting)
would tend to progressively decrease with
the age or duration of marriage. In fact, the
opposite is happening as is shown in Table
2. Whether this is true because of some
other factors that tend to offset the underreporting effect at work is an open question.

INVOLUNTARY CHILDLESSNESS

The data on childlessness, given in Table
3, provide another analytical arsenal where
more significant answers could be obtained.
The proportion of childlessness drops very
rapidly after the first five years of marriage,
and it appears to be nearly as low among
farmers as among other workers, especially
the sales and transportation and communication workers. In searching for factors
associated with involuntary childlessness,
one can infer from Tables 2 and 3 that the
ratio given in Table 2 for fertile women
only (those who have given birth to at least

+ one child) is of the same magnitude as for
co all women (fertile and childless), except for
3 Marriage duration under 5 years. This may
'g be due to the tendency among farmers to
marry very young women still in their pre.2 childbearing years.
— Added to this is the fact that in the
° Islamic culture a woman and a man are
g considered legally married if all legal reSquirements for that marriage have been
5 achieved, even though they have never lived

(who are not living as married couples) and
e ‘ s
2 those who are married and living as husQ band and wife. The number of new marriage contracts for Moslems in 1960 was
264,870, or 5.8% of total married Moslem
females in the country.

To be sure of whether or not significant
childlessness differentials are established
among the occupational categories, a twoway variable of analysis of variance, similar
to the one mentioned above in connection
with occupational fertility differentials, is
used. However, the results are not significant and the null hypothesis of no difference in the percentages of childlessness

among occupation is established. The computed F statistic is 1.25, which is exceeded
by the critical value of the F statistic at the
10% significance level for 8 and 32 degrees
of freedom.

This result urges one to hypothesize that
childlessness is related neither to occupation
of husband nor to means of birth control
but to other factors, such as adolescent
sterility, female age at marriage, and the
prevalence of a significant proportion of dejure marriages (those who are legally married but not living as married couples). If
this hypothesis is true, one expects an inverse relationship to prevail between the
average number of children that a fertile
married female has (Tables 1 and 5) and
the proportion of childless women (Tables
2 and 6). As indicated in Table 4, the correlation coefficients are all negatives, except
for duration of marriage under 5 years for
fertile women by education and childlessness, indicating that the smaller the proportion of childlessness the greater the fertility
will be. With respect to occupation, however, the correlation coefficients in duration
of marriage under 5 and 5 to 9 years are
not significant at the 5% level.

As an indication of fertility differentials,

however, the interpretation of these correlations is not a simple one. It is not clear
whether the given proportions of childlessness are a reflection of the actual fertility
level in a given occupational (or educational
group) or are outcomes of some kind of
selective process whereby women without
children are exposed to a greater risk of
divorce or suffer a lesser probability of remarriage once widowed or divorced. Further
discussion about these correlation coefficients, especially by education, is given in
the section on educational fertility.

INVOLUNTARY CHILD-SPACING MECHANISM

The impact of this factor displays itself
in the low fertility of fertile women married
to minors, quarrymen, and related workers.
Many men occupied in this major occupational group leave their wives at home for
extended periods of time. Added to this
separation factor are lactation practices,
infant mortality in as much as it affects
lactation, polygamy, and postpartum sexual
taboos.

HETEROGENEITY OF OCCUPATIONAL
CLASSIFICATION

The relatively high fertility of the wives
of the administrative, executive, and managerial workers is related to this factor.
This major occupational group includes a
large proportion of farm managers and village mayors who tend to be poorly educated

and have rural backgrounds. In 1960, there .

were nearly 60,000 married males in this
occupational group, or 1.2% of the total
married males in the A.R.E. Zikry (1963)
concluded that these farm managers and
village mayors tended to inflate the family
size of this occupational group.

EDUCATIONAL FERTILITY
DIFFERENTIALS

In the A.R.E., as in many other countries
at a comparable stage of economic and
social development, the majority of women
are either illiterate or have little education.
Their participation in the labor force is dependent upon moral values, their residence
in urban or village settlements, and/or their
educational level (Zikry, 1963; Weller,
1968; Stycos, 1965). Adopting these propositions, one can hypothesize an inverse relationship between fertility and the educational level of married women. Such a
relation is thought to follow from late age
at marriage due to educational involvement.
Westoff and Potvin (1967, p. 3) in their
study on fertility of women in colleges
noted that “persons (especially women)
receiving higher education develop interests
and values that compete with the attraction
of home, family, and children.”

Average number of children per thousand
fertile married women classified by duration
of marriage and educational attainment in
1960 is given in Table 5 and portrayed in

tional attainment of fertile married women
in all durations of marriages, with a few
exceptions of which marriage under five
years is the most apparent. In this duration,
the average of live births of the illiterates
is smaller than most of the other educational
levels. This discrepancy is related to the
small number of fertile married women with
doctorates (six women), the factors of involuntary childlessness (mentioned above),
the “making-up and advancing of births”
by women in the higher educational levels,
and the tendency of some women to overstate their education. Information on overstatements concerning education is lacking.
However, the positive correlation coefficient
between average number of children per
fertile married female (duration under 5
years) and percentages of childlessness
(Table 4) provides partial explanation.
This positive correlation (though insignificant) confirms the two major factors associated with involuntary  childlessness,
namely adolescent sterility and de jure
marriages, discussed above. Thus, the obtained association seems as if one is running
an association between two variables of
which one (childlessness) is increasing more
rapidly than its depletion (the state of

 

having one child); hence, an insignificant
positive correlation. In general, fertile married women who received no schooling at all
had an average of 4.8 live births, as compared
with 2.3 live births to fertile married women
with university education; that is, fertility
of illiterates is more than twice that of those
with university education.

A two-way classification of analysis of
variance is used in order to test the authenticity of the educational fertility differentials as given in Table 5. In this analysis of
variance, education of wife are the rows
(excluding the “Unstated” category) , duration of marriage forms the columns (excluding the ‘“Unstated” category), and the
average number of children provides all
data. The null hypothesis to be tested states
no difference in the mean number of children of mothers with different educational
levels. The computed F statistic is 7.29,
which exceeds the critical value of the F
statistic at the 0.01% significance level for
7 and 28 degrees of freedom (between 5.24
and 4.69). One concludes, then, that the
observed educational fertility differentials
are real.

The data on childlessness, given in Table 6
and related to education, provide another

proof of educational fertility differentials.
For each duration of marriage, the percentage of childless married women generally
increases with higher educational attainment. This percentage, however, generally
decreases as duration of marriage increases,

a situation indicating the removal of some
of the involuntary factors of childlessness

temporary prospective would be in order.
Such analysis, to be properly carried out,
requires cross-tabulation by cohort and
duration of marriage of women. This requirement is met by Table 7, which gives
the number of live births per thousand
married women according to their age and
current duration of marriage. Approximate
cohorts of mothers are obtained by merely
subtracting mothers’ age groups from 1960,
the census year (Whelpton, 1954, p. 16).
In Whelpton’s terminology, such cohorts

are called “actual cohorts” in the sense that
each cohort consists of those Egyptian
women who were born during a given
period that permitted them to be grouped
in the same age group. The same method is
used to obtain year of marriage by subtracting duration of marriage from 1960.
In considering cohort fertility differentials, Table 7 reveals an interesting comparison between the fertility of late and
early marriages for women born in different
spans of years. Women of recent marriages
(married since 1955 and after) have a lower
average number of live births than those
married earlier. The general fertility pattern
is that, the earlier the dates of current marriage the greater the average number of live
births per woman. Another generalization is
that women married at older ages tend to
have an average number of live births that
is higher than that for women marrying
early in the childbearing ages. Such pattern
is a “normal” consequence for women who
marry at ages closer to the termination of
their childbearing span. At such ages, the
sole desire of such women is the “making-up
of births” which have been postponed by
spinsterhood or the production of a family
in the new marriage. In Egypt, as in most

El Attar

other societies, children are believed by
women to ensure the stability of their marriages by keeping the husband attached to
the family (Blake, 1955, p. 31). This provides one explanation for the excess in
fertility of the earlier cohort groups who
married since 1955, particularly the cohort
of before 1910. A second explanation is
that some of the women of earlier cohorts
might have reported their live births from
previous marriages in addition to those from
their current marriage. A third explanation
is provided by Table 8 which shows high
percentages of childlessness, especially in
the three cohort groups of 1915, 1910, and
before 1910. The latter explanation can be
also an indication of memory lapse.

All in all, the data derived from cohort
analysis (Tables 7 and 8) show an elegant
presentation of fertility trends of the
earliest as well as the latest marriages of
women born in different span of years. The
important thing to note is that a greater
number of children are observed to be
associated with longer duration of marriage.
Accordingly, the fertility level of married
women in the A.R.E., as revealed by the
1960 census data, was a function of age and
duration of marriage rather than of volun

tary means of birth control. This hypothesis
is supported by the gradual increase in the
average number of live births per married
woman of the same educational level but in
different durations of marriage (see Table
5). The lower number of children produced
for each duration of marriage as the wives’
education rises substantiates the thesis that
female education may generate “areas of
interest”? which compete with marriage or
children (Westoff and Potvin, 1967, p.
= 120).

CONCLUSIONS

ember 201

In summary, from the data on fertility
© differentials analyzed in this paper, the fol59 lowing conclusions are drawn:
S First, occupational fertility differentials
<: have been observed. However, the observed
— pattern of occupational fertility differentials
= reverses the pattern observed in most other
= studies, where the fertility of women married to white-collar workers are reported to
‘S be lower than those married to workers
‘6 occupied in other occupations. Such an inverted pattern is partially due to defective
= data. From the data on childlessness by
5 husband’s occupation and cohort analysis
-, by duration of marriage, occupation of hus& band appeared as insignificant factor in
© generating childlessness differentials.
Second, in considering educational fertility differentials, education of wives emerged
© as an effective factor in establishing fertility
and childlessness differentials. Effectiveness
of wife’s education seems to be related to

the proposition that the majority of educated wives may intend to participate in the
labor force or in other activities that compete with child raising. Given this conclusion, one may infer that the A.R.E. is in the
process of demographic transition.

Third, the 1960 census of population
greatly underreported the number of children born to families in rural residents
and to families married before 1910. Obviously, the underreporting may arise either
from a misunderstanding of the census
question or else from the fact that children
who were not alive on the census date were
not counted (perhaps forgotten by the
parents).

Fourth, high childlessness among farmers,
service workers, and illiterates is believed
to be related to the tendency among females
in these groups to marry in very young prechildbearing years. Added to this is the fact
that the Egyptian census does not distinguish between de jure marriages (officially
contracted marriages whose parties have
not yet lived as married couples) and de
facto marriages which include all others
who are living as husband and wife.
