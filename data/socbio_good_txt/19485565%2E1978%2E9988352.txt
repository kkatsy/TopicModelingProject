ABSTRACT: Death rates vary over the life cycle in a standard fashion, with mortality probabilities
being highest at infant and older ages. Nevertheless, when age curves of mortality are compared
for different populations, they sometimes can be seen to intersect so that one population has
higher death rates at younger and middle ages and lower rates at older ages. Past research has
shown that this phenomenon is not due to erroneous data and is probably a result of some type of
selection in survival patterns. A sample of pairs of mortality curves, 31 of which cross over and 31
of which do not, for combinations of countries and dates are analyzed to discover which causes of
death are associated with the crossover phenomenon at the older ages. Cardiovascular and “other
and unknown” diseases appear to contribute strongly to the crossover effect. Further research
should deal with other comparisons and explore the underlying social and environmental factors.

The curve of age-specific death rates for
a population tends to assume a standard
form in which the death rate starts at a
high peak immediately after birth, falls to
a minimum in the early teens, and then
rises systematically with age until the
population has expired. Although populations with lower overall mortality generally have lower death rates at each age
than populations with higher overall mortality, one can observe population comparisons in which curves of age-specific
death rates intersect. This phenomenon of
intersecting curves of mortality is usually
referred to as the “mortality crossover” effect, and it has been the subject of some
discussion in the research literature.

Research on the topic of mortality crossovers can be of considerable demographic
significance for at least three reasons: (1)
Crossovers imply different curves of agespecific mortality which need to be understood. (2) They probably represent the
cumulative effect of one or more factors
occurring over the whole life cycle but

which results in a crossover at a specific
age. (3) To the extent that crossovers are
explainable by some process of selection,
variables producing the selection should
be identified so that attention can be given
to influencing them.

RELATED RESEARCH

For some time now, demographers have
noted a peculiar tendency for age curves of
mortality for some pairs of populations to
“cross over’ each other, usually at the
older ages. Although this phenomenon has
been reported for various populations at
different past points in time, it has most
frequently been described for comparisons
of white and nonwhite populations in the
United States (Spiegelman, 1967; Thornton and Nam, 1968).

For example, age-specific death rates in
the United States in 1970 were higher for
nonwhites than whites in every age category up through the age group 65-74. In
the age group 75-84, however, the non
306

Vol. 25, No. 4

white population had a lower death rate
than whites, and the comparison was even
more favorable for nonwhites in the 85and-over age group. Thus, the overall advantage in death rates which the white
population had did not persist at all ages.

The phenomenon described does not
appear to be a function of the measures of
mortality used or the time periods observed. The crossover effect obtains when
life expectancy at each age is substituted
for age-specific death rates, and the relationship is noted for every decennial year
back to 1900, when reliable statistics were
first available (Thornton and Nam, 1968).
The reversal in rates is also observed when
cohort, rather than period, data are analyzed (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1973). Moreover, the
pattern is observable when the sexes are
considered separately, although the reversal of rates for whites and nonwhites takes
place at a somewhat earlier age for males
than females (Myers and Bayo, 1965).

This mortality crossover effect is not at
all limited to whites and nonwhites in the
United States. For example, it can be seen
in comparisons of racial or ethnic groups
in other parts of the world (United Nations, 1961). Thus, Moslems have higher
death rates than European-origin populations in Algeria until about age 70, after
which the rates for Moslems are lower. In
New Zealand, the crossover is evident for
females after 85 in the comparison of
Maoris and European-origin groups. The
crossover phenomenon has likewise been
reported among Jews and non-Jews in
Canada, with the rates becoming more
favorable for non-Jews as early as age 25
for females and age 35 for males (Spiegelman, 1948).

Reversals of death rates by age can also
be seen when populations not potentially
in interaction, or not sharing the same
resources, are compared. The mortality

able than for the United States at the
younger ages but becomes more favorable
at the older ages (Myers, 1964). Similarly,
Chileans surpass Americans in attaining
lower death rates at older ages (United
Nations, 1961). Even when data for the
same country are inspected at different
points in time, the crossover effect may
take place when the different sets of agespecific death rates are compared. For
instance, when life tables for English
males for 1920~—22 and 1950-52 are examined, the mortality differential benefits
those in the 1920-22 group after age 83.
For females, a similar crossing occurs at
age 88 (Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 1970).

It is not necessary, however, that populations having different death rates at the
younger ages should have death rates at
the older ages which are opposite in direction. In fact, one can find many pairs of
populations for which mortality crossover
does not occur. A most obvious example is
in comparisons of the sexes. Compared
with males, females have superior life expectancy at all ages in modern societies. In
addition, comparisons of some countries
fails to reveal crossovers, and reversals are
absent when age curves of mortality are
compared for some countries over time
(United Nations, 1961).

In considering this puzzling phenomenon, one might first suspect that the data
on which these calculations are performed
are erroneous, especially at the older ages.
This hypothesis for interpreting the
findings seems likely in light of what
demographers have discovered to be the
nature of reporting in all censuses and
vital registrations. To a greater or lesser
extent, there is a tendency for errors in the
data to be more pronounced at the older
ages and among socioeconomically lessadvantaged populations. In fact, it has
been assumed fora long time that the mortality crossover effect is attributable

308 Nam
mainly to weaknesses in the statistics, and
few researchers have sought explanations
for it.

In the past few years, however, enough
evidence has accumulated to show that an
explanation of the effect in terms of erroneous data is not supportable. Even
when adjustments are made of the U.S.
data, the effect persists. Three examples
should suffice to document the point.
First, Myers and Bayo analyzed Social Security data for 1959-61 which were based
on documentary proof of age under Old
Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance
provisions (Myers and Bayo, 1965). They
found the crossover pattern among whites
and nonwhites, although it occurred at a
slightly later age in their data than in the
general mortality data. Second, Thornton
and Nam applied Siegel’s adjusted population estimates by age, race, and sex for
1950 and 1960 as denominators for agespecific death rates of whites and nonwhites in the United States and also found
some shift in the age at crossover, but the
effect remained (Thornton and Nam,
1968). Third, Kitagawa and Hauser made
the most detailed adjustments of the data
for 1959-61 before calculating specific
death rates (Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973).
Three sets of rates were determined, based
on different assumptions. The conclusion
reached was that the combined adjustments do not alter the finding that a reversal in death rates of whites and nonwhites
occurs. That errors in the data at the older
ages might account for the crossover is
further suspect when we consider that the
reversal may occur at younger ages in
populations having highly reliable data (as
in the case of Jews and non-Jews in
Canada).

One is therefore led to an alternative
hypothesis, namely, that some type of
selection process is at work during the life
cycle of populations involved. The most
appealing hypothesis is that socioeconomic

et al. Social Biology
conditions favoring one group result in
lower death rates at younger ages which
permit many to survive to older ages who
are not physically and/or physiologically
strong. The less-advantaged group, it can
be further supposed, has higher death
rates at the younger ages, and those who
survive those early years are physically
and/or physiologically more fit to continue
on to older ages, even to overcome persistent socioeconomic disadvantage. Such an
explanatory model, in effect, regards biological and social factors as being in interaction. This simplified explanation can
be made more complicated by recognizing
that myriad other factors (of a social, biological, or environmental nature) can be
associated with these selective processes.
For example, socioeconomic conditions
may vary over time, or by age, differently
for one population than another; different
residential locations or migration patterns
may create different risks of death from
certain causes for the groups; or health
and medical care practices may differ
among the populations, quite apart from
those suggested by socioeconomic circumstances.

As a first step in testing some of these
ideas, we undertook to measure the extent
of the crossover phenomenon in cross-national perspective and then to explore the
underlying cause-of-death structures. We
obtained data on life expectancy at birth,
age-specific death rates, cause-of-death
patterns by age, and per capita income
levels for females in 29 countries at several
past dates (Preston et al., 1972; Preston,
1976). The total of 46 country-years represent those for which reasonably reliable
data could be gathered. They do not constitute a representative sample of all possible countries and years which might be
studied, but they do cover a wide range of
development levels, overall mortality
levels, and cause-of-death patterns.

By relating the 46 populations to each

Vol. 25, No. 4

other, we obtained 1,035 pairs of age
curves of mortality and associated data.
Since it was apparent from earlier work
that the reversal of age-specific death rates
occurred principally at the older ages, we
restricted our analysis to the age groups 60
and over.

It was discovered that 649 out of the
1,035 pairs of curves did not cross at all at
ages 60 and over (Table 1). On the other
hand, 279 of them crossed once, and 107
crossed in two or more of our age categories. When we classified the populations
by their per capita income level, we found
that 168 of the 279 which crossed once did,
in fact, constitute situations in which the
population with the higherincome level had
a relatively lower death rate at the earlier
ages and arelatively higher death rate at the
older ages. However, in 111 of the pairs
which crossed once, the crossover occurred
in the opposite direction, with the lower
income population eventually attaining a
higher death rate at the older ages. It was
clear, therefore, that our original hypothesis
was not an adequate representation of the
selection phenomemon.

Since our socioeconomic measurement
was not the most desirable one, and since
it was our immediate purpose to identify
the cause-of-death patterns associated

with crossovers and to defer consideration
of other explanatory factors until a later
time, a scheme was devised for pinpointing causes of death related to the crossover
phenomenon.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A sample of 31 country-year pairs was
selected from the 279 pairs which crossed
one time at ages 60 and over (see Table 2).
These 31 included 21 in which the crossover was in the hypothesized direction
and 10 in which the crossover occurred in
the direction opposite to that predicted.
Another sample of 31 country-year pairs
was drawn from the 649 noncrossover
pairs and matched with the 31 crossover
pairs. Four criteria were selected for the
matching. Ranked in terms of priority,
they were: similarities in average life expectancy at birth, calendar year of mortality data, per capita income, and region of
the world (differentiated according to
Asia, Europe, Latin America, North
America, and Oceania). (The values of the
matched variables are given in Table 3.)
The aim was to effect a reasonably close
match of a crossover and noncrossover
pair on all of these criteria. Hence, when
cause-of-death patterns were compared,
the comparison would be a function of the
different slopes of the age curves of mortality and not of the variables used in the
matching procedure.

Our analysis of causes of death by age
took account of six age categories (60-64,
65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, and 85 and
over) and six cause-of-death categories
(influenza, pneumonia, and _ bronchitis;
diarrhea; cardiovascular diseases; neoplasms; certain degenerative diseases; and
other and unknown causes).

RESULTS

The findings of our analysis are statistically summarized in Tables 3 through 6.

Because the crossovers did not always
occur in the predicted direction (in terms
of the per capita income levels of the two
populations), we separated the analysis
into Sample A (those occurring in the hypothesized direction) and Sample B (those
in which the lower-income population had
a higher death rate after the crossover).
Table 4 examines those 21 pairs of populations in which a crossover occurred,
with the higher-income population moving from a lower to higher age-specific
date rate. In 19 of the 21 cases, the cross
over took place because the upward slope
of the rate for cardiovascular disease in the
higher-income population was greater
than all other causes of death for both
populations. The slope of the mortality
curve for the higher-income population
was primarily determined by the increasing death rates from cardiovascular disease. In 15 of the cases, this was the sole
cause-of-death explanation. In 2 of the 21
pairs, the more rapidly-rising rate of other
and unknown diseases in the higher-income population was the primary cause;

but in one of these 2 cases a sharper increase in cardiovascular disease was a Secondary and contributing cause. No other
cause category afforded any explanation of
the crossover phenomenon for these pairs
of populations.

In Table 5, 21 pairs of populations
which did not exhibit crossover, but were
matched on the four variables to the crossover pairs, are analyzed. Here, we can
observe that, while cardiovascular disease
in the higher-income population tended to
be the dominant cause of death in the
pairs, the separation of the two curves was
maintained because either cardiovascular
or other and unknown disease rates rose
more quickly in the lower-income popula
tion which initially had the higher agespecific death rates.

Table 6 shows 10 population pairs
which crossed over, but with the lower-income population moving from a relatively
lower to a relatively higher age-specific
death rate. The dominant cause-specific
death rate in these populations is divided
between cardiovascular and other and
unknown diseases. Likewise, the cause
which principally accounts for the crossover is divided among these two cause
categories. In most cases, these two causes
combine to produce the crossover effect;
that is, a disproportionate rise in the rates
for these two causes in the lower-income
populations produces the crossover effect.

that a sharper upward slope for cardiovascular disease in the higher-income population most often keeps the two curves from
crossing. In 2 cases, the category of other
and unknown diseases shows the most
rapid increase in the higher-income population, and in a number of other cases the
effect of trends in other and unknown
diseases is a secondary but contributory
explanation of the noncrossover.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

When pairs of populations whose age
curves of mortality exhibit crossover at the

older ages were matched on four critical
variables to pairs of populations which do
not exhibit crossover, it was discovered
that the behavior of two cause-specific
curves of death rates by age (cardiovascular
disease, and other and unknown diseases)
account for the fact of crossover or noncrossover. The more rapidly-rising slope
of the cardiovascular curve in one of the
populations tends most often to be the
primary effect and otherwise produces a
secondary effect. The differential trend of
the curves for other and unknown diseases
in the two populations frequently
produces a_ secondary’ effect and
sometimes is a primary factor. No other
set of causes of death seems to be of any

substantial significance in effecting crossovers.

Our analysis so far has enabled us to
specify some factors related to the mortality crossover effect. We have begun to
delve into possible areas of clarification
and are preparing to explore further for
more fundamental kinds of mechanisms
that might be at work. For example, we
are aware that considerable variation has
existed among countries in classification of
cause of death. Some of the country-years
for which the category of other and
unknown causes demonstrates a substantial effect seem to have an excessive
amount of reporting in that category. It is
quite possible that some of those reports
properly belong in the cardiovascular or
some other category. More intensive study
of this problem may aid in our interpretation. Also, we are collecting data on other
measures with which to categorize populations, and this may help to better structure
our general hypothesis. In addition, we
plan to look at the whole age curve of
mortality. Furthermore, we hope to turn

et al. Social Biology
our attention as well to individual-level
data where the selective processes in mortality over the life cycle can be perceived
from a different perspective. Finally, we
want to discover what programs and policies in different countries and among various population groups lead to greater or
lesser incidence of cardiovascular and
other causes of death as older ages are
approached.

Clearly, the study of mortality offers
many possibilities, and too few researchers
are concentrating on this subject these
days. The phenomenon of “mortality crossover” provides one context in which an
aspect of the general problem of trends
and differentials in death rates can be analyzed.
