Communications

Human Biology Council

A number of North American human
biologists met in April, 1973, and initiated
the formation of an organization for the
purpose of supporting the journal Human
Biology and nominating its editors.

Therefore, the Human Biology Council
to advance the science of human biology,
through advice to and support of Human
Biology and other relevant publications,
and through promotion of research and
teaching concerning human biological variation, has now been established.

Members for 1974 will be considered
Charter Members. Scholars and students
who wish to join should write to the
chairman pro-tem, Dr. Paul Baker (Department of Anthropology, 511 Social
Science Building, The Pennsylvania State
University, University Park, Pennsylvania
16802), and should summarize their qualifications. Student membership is for a

Master’s Level Training in Data

 

period of not more than 3 years and
applications must include a statement from
a professor who can vouch for the status
as a student.

Dues for 1974 are $10.00 for regular
members and $6.00 for student members.
Dues include subscription to the quarterly
journal Human Biology. Checks should be
made out to the “Human Biology Council”
and may be sent with applications to
Dr. Paul Baker, chairman of the Organizing Committee, who will arrange the review
of applications and will forward dues payments to the acting treasurer, Dr. Michael
A. Little.

Donations to help cover the organizing
expenses will be appreciated. Arrangements
are being made to suitably recognize supporting members and benefactors and to
gain tax exempt status.

The Department of Biostatistics at the
University of North Carolina in Chapel
Hill now offers one-year programs of study
leading to either the Master of Public
Health (MPH) or the Master of Science
in Public Health (MSPH) degree in Biostatistics with special emphasis on management of computer-based health data

systems. Graduates will be prepared for
