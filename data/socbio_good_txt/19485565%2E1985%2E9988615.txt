Only recently has there been effort to

The term “alcohol dependence”? will
be used to denote the syndrome describing pathogenic use of alcohol, tolerance
to alcohol, and symptoms of withdrawal
from alcohol. The term “alcoholism”

will be used to denote a syndrome which
includes medical and psychosocial complications of chronic alcohol dependence as well as the presence of alcohol
dependence symptoms.

DIAGNOSIS OF ALCOHOLISM

Diagnosis in psychiatry has moved
from global clinical descriptions of behavior thought to typify a condition to
schema of inclusion and exclusion criteria. To diagnose alcoholism many investigators use the ‘“‘Feighner”’ criteria
(Feighner et al., 1972), the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of the American
Psychiatric Association (DSM-III,
1980), and occasionally the National
Council on Alcoholism (Criteria Committee, 1972) as well as the World
Health Organization (WHO, 1982) diagnostic criteria. The Feighner diagnostic criteria for alcoholism are based ona
grouping of symptoms describing alcohol dependence and signs of chronic alcohol use (Feighner et al., 1972). The diagnosis of “‘alcoholic-ever’ requires
heavy alcohol use and the attainment of
a series of medical, legal, social, and/or
family complications and symptoms of
withdrawal and tolerance to alcohol.
Specifically, the Feighner classification
defines a person as ‘“‘alcoholic” if ever he
or she has drunk alcohol daily for at least
one year and has taken six or more
drinks at least two or three times a
month; or has drunk six or more drinks
at least one time a week for more than
one year (heavy drinking) and in addition has developed problems from
drinking in at least three of four groups:
(1) social disapproval by friends, parents; marital problems; (2) job trouble,
traffic arrests, other police trouble; (3)
frequent blackouts, tremor, withdrawal

hallucinations or convulsions, delirium
tremens; and (4) loss of control, morning drinking. Problem drinking is different from alcoholic drinking as it meets
the criteria for heavy drinking but not
for alcoholic drinking.

The World Health Organization
takes the position of Edwards and Gross
(1976) in describing the alcohol dependence syndrome as representing a core
biologic process unencumbered by the
consequential behaviors listed in the
Feighner characterization as social, job,
or legal problems. The seven elements
that outline the alcohol dependence syndrome include: narrowing of the drink- —
ing repertoire; salience of drink-seeking
behavior; increased tolerance to alcohol; repeated withdrawal symptoms; relief drinking; compulsion to drink; and
readdiction liability. These items describe the pattern of clinical alcohol dependence and are derived from biologically based symptoms of tolerance,
withdrawal, compulsion, and readdiction (World Health Organization,
1982).

The most recent attempts to provide
reliable and valid means of clinically
separating alcohol abuse from alcohol
dependence have resulted in the DSMIII diagnostic criteria (DSM-III, 1980).
The DSM-III diagnosis of alcohol dependence requires either a pattern of
pathological alcohol use (inability to
stop, binges, blackouts) or impairment
of social or occupational functioning
and either development of tolerance (to
increasing amounts of alcohol) or withdrawal symptoms after drinking. Thus,
as in the Feighner criteria, psychosocial
consequences are used in the DSM-III
assessment of alcohol dependence.
Hence alcohol dependence can be
viewed solely in terms of physical de

pendence symptoms of pathological
use, tolerance, and withdrawal, or it
may include those symptoms plus the
range of psychosocial consequences so
long associated with the sociopathy of
alcoholism. In this review, attention will
be directed toward efforts to assess the
role of antisocial personality or sociopathy when evaluating the psychosocial
consequences of the alcoholism syndrome. Social disruption may be secondary to the effects on personality of
chronic alcohol dependence. On the
other hand, psychosocial complications
of alcohol dependence may arise from
antisocial personality behavioral factors
that precede the dependent state but
nevertheless are part of the development of dependence on alcohol.

To be scientifically useful, diagnosis
must not only allow for detection and assessment of the condition, but must also
isolate and measure the major features
and subforms of the condition so that its
etiology and transmission can be understood.

Typologies of alcoholism based on a
priori qualitative dichotomies of characteristics (Table 1) and a posteriori clusters of quantitative dimensions of alcoholism (Table 2) have been proposed
(Meyer et al., 1983). Following the lead
of Cloninger and Reich (1983), who observed and described the clinical heterogeneity of alcoholism and antisocial personality, our research group has
attempted to generate genetic typologies of alcoholism based on sex, family
history of alcoholism,. and antisocial
personality diagnosis of the alcoholic
and his or her family. Numerous family
studies have shown alcoholism morbidity in the first- and second-degree relatives of alcoholics (Winokur et al., 1970;
Cloninger et al., 1978; Stabenau and

Data from a review of 39 family pedigree studies using a number of different
clinical diagnostic systems for the diagnosis of alcoholism (Cotton, 1979) indicate that the frequencies of alcoholism
among parents of proband alcoholics
are higher (28 per cent fathers and 6.3
per cent mothers) than for control subjects with psychiatric (9.2 per cent male
and 1.9 per cent female) or medical or
surgical (4 per cent male and 0.9 per cent

female) diagnoses or for males (10.1 per
cent) or females (4.1 per cent) in the
general population.

Although pedigree ties suggest a genetic pattern of transmission, cultural
familial factors from the rearing family
confound the issue. Thus, family pedigree data may support both a genetic
and a cultural hypothesis for the transmission of alcoholism. Twin and adopwn tion studies have also provided data to

Reich (1983) expressed the shared genetic vulnerability for family members

in Table 3, the highest correlation 1s 0.92
for monozygotic twins and the lowest is
0.14 for grandsons. The ranking of the
correlation coefficients strongly supports a genetic vulnerability hypothesis
for alcoholism. There have been two

that of Cloninger et al. (1981). Goodwin
et al. (1973) characterized adoptees and
their biologic and adoptive parents according to Feighner criteria for the diagnosis of alcoholism. Eighteen per cent of
55 male adoptees with an alcoholic biologic parent were characterized as_
alcoholic-ever, while significantly fewer
(5 per cent) of control adoptees had
alcoholic-ever drinking patterns. Cadoret (1978), also using the Feighner criteria for the diagnosis of definite alcoholism, found alcoholism in two of six
adoptees with alcoholic biologic parents
compared to one with alcoholism
among the 78 control adoptees.

The Feighner and DSM-III classification schemas place considerable weight
on the subject’s psychosocial behaviors
in the diagnosis of alcoholism and the alcohol dependent state, respectively.
Current studies are attempting to ascertain how much contribution to the risk
for phenotypic alcoholism derives from
the ‘‘familial” alcoholism genotype and
how much from the genotype of alcohol

ity and whether there is an interaction
between the two (Cloninger and Reich,
1983; Lewis et al., 1983; Stabenau et al.,
1983; Stabenau and Hesselbrock,
19844, 1984b).

The diagnosis of antisocial personality (ASP) as determined by DSM-III criteria is made from a prescribed series of
four sets of childhood and adult antisocial behaviors and conditions (a-d): (a)
The individual is at least 18 years of age.
(b) The onset and history include three
or more Of the following before age 15:
(1) truancy; (2) suspension from school;
(3) arrests; (4) running away; (5) persistent lying; (6) repeated casual sex; (7) repeated drunkenness or substance abuse;
(8) theft; (9) vandalism; (10) grade IQ
discrepancy; (11) violations of rule; (12)
initiation of fights. (c) There have been
at least four manifestations of the following since age 18: (1) inability to function
as a responsible parent; (3) failure to accept social norms with respect to law; (4)
inability to maintain attachment to a
sexual partner; (5) irritability and aggressiveness; (6). failure to honor financial obligations; (7) failure to plan
ahead; impulsivity; (8) disregard for
truth; (9) recklessness. (d) There is a
pattern of continuous antisocial behavior with no intervening period of at least
5 years (DSM-III, 1980).

The prevalence of antisocial personality in the general population is 3.5 per
cent for white males and 1.0 per cent for
white females (Cloninger et al., 1978).
There have been few studies designed to
measure the genetic contributions of underlying components to the antisocial
syndrome. The evidence from twin
studies that impulsivity is a temperament is not substantial (Buss and
Plomin, 1978). However, a recent study
of 12,898 unselected twin pairs in Swe

den demonstrated heritability indexes
for psychosocial instability of 0.5 for
men and 0.58 for women and for psychosocial extraversion of 0.54 and 0.66
for men and women, respectively. The
authors attributed about one-half of the
phenotypic variance to genetic factors
(Floderus-Myrhed et al., 1980). It is not
clear whether these characteristics are
associated with the development of antisocial personality disorder.

Family pedigree studies of individuals diagnosed as ASP have demonstrated genetic correlation between
first-degree family members with the
same diagnosis. The tetrachoric correlation that described the diagnostic concordance for ASP was r = 0.49 between
singleton siblings and r = 0.29 for parent
and offspring. Correlations for criminality (considered to represent ASP) were
higher for MZ (r= 0.70) than for DZ
(r = 0.41) twins (Cloninger and Reich,
1983). Adoption studies that control for
effects of being reared with biologic parents or siblings have demonstrated a
significant correlation between development of ASP in adoptees and the presence of ASP in their biologic parents.
Control adoptees and their biologic parents did not show this relationship
(Crowe, 1974; Cadoret, 1978). Considerable support for a genetic vulnerability hypothesis for antisocial personality
disorder has emerged from these family
pedigree, twin, and adoption studies.

Until recently there has been confusion as to the genetic role of ASP and familial alcoholism in the transmission of
alcoholism. Interview studies have now
shown that ASP and alcoholism have
both different and separate segregation
patterns in families (Cloninger et al.,
1979; Cloninger and Reich, 1983). Specifically, first-degree relatives of alco302

holics have significantly elevated rates
of alcoholism (33 per cent male, 4 per
cent female), while rates for ASP are
those of the general population (3 per
cent male, 1 per cent female). Conversely, ASP morbidity rates are highest
for first-degree family members of ASP
subjects (18 per cent male, 8 per cent female) and frequencies of alcoholism are
in the expected range (6 per cent male, 0
wy per cent female) (Cloninger and Reich,
1983).
The frequency of antisocial personality diagnosis in samples of alcoholics
S ranges from 20 to 40 per cent for males
S and from 10 to 15 per cent for females
& (Winokur et al., 1970; Powell et al.,
S 1982; Stabenau, 1984). Another view of
©? the diagnostic interaction is provided by
#3 aseries of 412 medical and surgical inpatients diagnosed as having definite lifetime diagnoses of either ASP, alcoholism, or both. The frequency of
alcoholism in ASP-diagnosed subjects
was 68 per cent for males and 39 per cent
7 for females (Lewis et al., 1983).
Alcoholism associated with antisocial
‘5 personality has appeared in differing
>. fashions in three adoption studies of al= coholism. In their Swedish adoption
3 study of alcoholism, Cloninger et al.
g (1981) characterized their adopted alco5 holics as: (1) Type I (13 per cent), those
4 with a significant but weak genetic vulnerability for alcoholism; and (2) Type
It (4 per cent), those with a criminal alcoholic biologic father and a ninefold increase in risk for alcoholism. The Type
II alcoholic male of the Swedish adoption study may be what others have described as the male ASP alcoholic. Similarly, the Danish adoption study
demonstrated an excess of antisocial behavior in childhood in one sample of
adopted male alcoholics (Goodwin et

ember 201

al., 1975), and the American adoption
study of alcoholism tound that two of
three fathers with antisocial diagnosis or
behavior but no alcoholism diagnosis by
Feighner criteria were the biologic fathers of adopted-out sons who were diagnosed alcoholic (one with antisocial
personality in addition to alcoholism)
(Cadoret, 1978).

SEX DIFFERENCES IN
ALCOHOLISM

Observed differences in features of
the development and expression of alcoholism between males and females may
be in part due to chromosomal genetic
gender differences in the response to alcohol, but also may be due to the effects
of culturally determined behavioral differences between men and women in
the use of alcohol. Morbidity rates of alcoholism for women have been reported
as less than half of those for men (see.
Table 4). ‘However, numerous family
pedigree studies have demonstrated
that there is an equal frequency of alcoholism in first- and second-degree relatives of male and female alcoholics
(Winokur et al., 1970; Cotton, 1979;
Stabenau and Hesselbrock, 1980, 1983;
Hall et al., 1983a). Genetic transmission continues through those women
whether they drink sufficient amounts of
alcohol to become dependent or not. In
order to compare men and women,
some selected drinking behaviors and
physical consequences of alcohol dependence are shown in Table 4. These data
demonstrate that men drink earlier;
drink more heavily; enter the later
stages of addiction at an earlier age; and
develop more fatty liver, ischemic heart
disease, and gastritis than do women alcoholics (Glatt, 1961; Haglund and

However, Von Wartburg and Buhler
(1984) contend that women may develop cirrhosis with consumption of as
little as 20 grams of alcohol per day.
Cloninger et al. (1978) have concluded
that most alcohol consumption differences between male and female alcoholics are due not to genetic factors but
to sociocultural environmental factors.
The varied reports in the literature
are difficult to assess and compare when
different diagnostic schema are used in
different samples. For example, the onset of alcohol dependence may be described in one sample, the complications
of alcoholic drinking in another sample,
and the occurrence of psychopathology
in alcoholics and their family members
in yet a different sample. Selected data

Health Center (UCHC) “typology”
sample of 321 male and female patients

(Meyer et al., 1983) will be used in order
to evaluate some of these and other issues important to the clinical assessment
of the alcoholic.

Clinical issues such as the age at the
various stages of dependence, the quantity and frequency of alcohol use, and
the occurrence of psychological and/or
physical impairment subsequent to
chronic alcohol use were considered in
the UCHC sample. A detailed alcohol
drinking and drug use history, a stand
_ardized psychiatric interview using the

NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule
(DIS), and the Family History Research
Diagnostic Criteria (FHRDC) were utilized. The latter measured family alcohol use and psychopathology. The
methods have been described elsewhere
(M. Hesselbrock et al., 1983).

ALCOHOLISM ASSOCIATED

ALCOHOLISM

Family pedigree, twin, and adoption
studies of alcoholism and antisocial personality have suggested that alcoholism
is heterogeneous in genetic transmission
patterns and in phenotypic expression of
the syndrome (Cloninger and Reich,
1983). Attempts are being made to assess the.separate and combined genetic
contributions of family-history-positive
(“familial”) alcoholism and alcoholism
associated with antisocial personality to
the syndrome of alcoholism. Approximately 40 per cent of both males and females in the UCHC sample had primary
alcoholism (see Table 5). Table 5 also
shows other diagnoses. Depression
prior to onset of alcoholism occurred for
43 per cent of females as compared to 14

Family pedigrees used to assess the
role of genetic factors in alcoholism
have been characterized by our group in
three ways: family history negative
(FHN), no alcoholism on either side;

» family history positive unilineal

(FHPU), alcoholism on one side only;

Vand family history positive bilineal
'{FHPB), alcoholism on both sides of the
family (Stabenau and Hesselbrock,

Other methods have been described by
Penick et al. (1978), Frances et al.
(1980), and McKenna et al. (1981). The
numbers of males and females in these
three family pedigree types are shown in
Table 6. Alcoholism among first-degree
family members, determined by use of
the family history method, was observed
in frequencies similar to those found in
studies using family history—interview
methodologies (Winokur et al., 1970).
Frequencies of alcoholism were 16-48
per cent for fathers and brothers and 320 per cent for mothers and sisters (see

women alcoholics (9-17 per cent) were
higher than rates expected (3 per cent)
in the general population. This process
of assortative mating defines a bilineal
alcoholic family pedigree in the next
generation. Wilson (this volume) has
described selective breeding for dependence liability in mice. Such animal data
suggest a model that may be used in exploring the genetic transmission of dependence liability in offspring of human
parents when both are alcoholic or when
one is alcoholic and the other has antisocial personality disorder.

The transmission of risk for alcoholism from parents with alcoholism or antisocial personality diagnosis to their
children has been explored through
follow-up studies and comparative family sibling studies. Several large-scale
prospective follow-up studies have
linked childhood behaviors of conduct
disorder (characterized by impulsivity)
and attention deficit disorder (characterized by distractibility) to a significantly higher occurrence of alcoholism in
such “at-risk” individuals when they
were followed to adulthood (McCord et
al., 1960; Robins et al., 1962; Robins,
1966; Vaillant, 1982). A study of highrisk and Boston city-core children demonstrated the significant power of childhood delinquent acts to predict
subsequent adult alcoholism (Vaillant,
1930). Children born to parents who
were family history positive for antisocial spectrum disorder (ASP, alcoholism, and hysteria) had significantly more
conduct disorder. Children born to
family-history-negative parents showed
little evidence of conduct disturbance,
had more learning and academic problems, and had siblings with attentional
and learning disabilities but not conduct
disorder. August and Stewart (1983)

Stabenau

Social Biology

conclude that conduct disorder is genetically linked to ASP spectrum disorder,
while attention deficit disorder is not.
Although the focus on genetic factors
may increase understanding of the biologic components leading to alcohol dependence, nongenetic environmental
and cultural variables are an integral
part of the expression of any biologic
vulnerability toward alcoholism. Reich
et al. (1975) have developed a multifactorial model for expressing disease
transmission. Multifactorial models of a
disorder offer the opportunity for assessment of the relative contributions of
genetic and environmental-cultural factors to heterogeneous subforms of the
disorder. Morton (1977) has described a
method for approximating resolution of
cultural and biological inheritance using
path analysis and using segregation

‘models to demonstrate major gene loci.

Nesselroade and McArdle (this volume)
have shown the applicability of multivariate models in hypothesis testing as exemplified by the work of Huba and
Bentler (1982) on alcoholism.

THE NATURAL HISTORY OF THE
DEVELOPMENT OF ALCOHOL
DEPENDENCE

In order to review the relative contributions of the three genetically determined vulnerability factors in the risk
for alcoholism, i.e., sex, ASP, and family history of alcoholism, I will again refer to the UCHC study sample to illustrate the contribution of each of these to
the development of alcohol dependence
and to the consequences of chronic alcohol dependence.

Several studies have demonstrated
an earlier onset of drinking and the subsequent stages of dependence in men as

compared to women (Glatt, 1961).
They have also shown that both men
and women with ASP diagnosis drink to
drunkenness at an earlier age than nonASP alcoholics (Schuckit et al., 1969;
M. Hesselbrock et al., 1984). In the Table 9 sample, although women began
drinking alcohol later than men, they
became dependent and entered treatment at a similar age (Stabenau, 1984).
This telescoping of dependence on alcohol in women has also been described by
others (Glatt, 1961; Taylor et al., 1983).
ASP individuals, although beginning alcoholic drinking earlier than non-ASP
alcoholics, enter into treatment at about
the same age (see Table 9). Amark
(1951) expressed the risk for alcoholism
by age in a sample of 600 male alcoholics
from three sources in Sweden. He found

Heredity and Alcohol

307

that by age 26, one-quarter of the risk
for alcoholism had passed; by age 32,
one-half had passed; and by age 37,
three-quarters had passed. The entire
risk in his sample had been passed by
age 54.

Ginsberg (1977), in considering the
use of animals as genetic models of behavior disorders, said ‘‘most human behavioral syndromes expressed themselves in three dimensions: affective,

Bernard, has recognized that there are

often multiple etiologies involved within
a syndrome and that there is no one to
one correspondence between symptom
complex and its underlying causes.”

Goodwin (1979) has cited Jellinek’s
early work in describing ‘familial alcoholism” as a form of alcoholism characterized by a family history of alcoholism;
early onset; severe symptoms; and absence of other conspicuous psychopathology. Other studies have shown
family-history-positive alcoholics to
have earlier onset and more social problems (Penick et al., 1978); to have more
severe alcoholic-related symptoms and
more antisocial behavior (Frances et al.,
1980); to be younger at the age of first
intoxication; and to proceed to treatment for alcoholism at an earlier age if
both parents were alcoholic (McKenna
and Pickens, 1981). The relationship between “‘conspicuous”’ psychopathology
in the alcoholic and psychopathology in
his family of origin and the natural history of alcoholism, although not clear, is
beginning to be resolved by comparing
alcoholics as to their alcohol use, family
history, sex, and psychopathology diagnosis (Stabenau, 1984).

In order to evaluate physical, psychological, and social behaviors consequent
to prolonged alcohol dependence, V.
Hesselbrock et al. (19855) used principal
component analysis of behaviors reported by the UCHC sample for the 6
months prior to study. Three factors
were produced: Impaired Control and
Physical Symptoms; Psychosocial Problems; and Symptoms Associated with
Prolonged Alcohol Use (see Table 10).
These three factors describing consequences of chronic alcohol use are compared as mean scores in Table 11 (Stabenau, 1984). Alcohol consumption in

month prior to treatment ts not-significantly different across groups. Alcoholics.with biologic relatives having alcoholism on both sides of the family
reported significantly more psychosocial
problems, more physical symptoms and
impaired control (a measure of alcohol
dependence), and more symptoms associated with chronic alcohol abuse (a
measure of bodily and CNS impairment) than did the other probands. Differences in genetic load for alcoholism
derived from the family pedigree may
be hypothesized to account for these
findings. These three variables—family
history of alcoholism, ASP diagnosis,
and sex—account for about 25 per cent
of variance in measurement in each of
these factors. Alcohol use variables contribute to a majority of the remaining
variance.

Frances et al. (1980) found familyhistory-positive males to have more severe physical and psychosocial symptoms, while McKenna and Pickens
(1981) found no differences for alcohol
dependence but a greater number of arrests and marked alcoholic aggressive
behavior for bilineal alcoholics. In our
study, increased problematic psychosocial behaviors were found for both
family-history-positive bilineal and ASP
alcoholics (Stabenau, 1984). In an analysis of covariance, separate main effects
of family history of alcoholism and of
ASP were demonstrated, but there was
no significant interaction for the range
of psychosocial behaviors measured.
This finding may explain the increase in
alcoholic psychosocial behaviors often
reported by other investigators of ‘‘familial alcoholism.” It also suggests the
importance of including the diagnostic
psychosocial items in the DSM-III and
the Feighner criteria.

MARKERS OF RISK FOR THE
DEVELOPMENT OF
ALCOHOLISM

Diagnostic assessment of alcoholism
and planning for its treatment may be
advanced by identifying the factors that
place a person at genetic risk for alcohol
addiction and the secondary consequences of chronic alcohol exposure. In
reviewing the significance of animal

‘models for isolating genetic factors re
lated to alcohol abuse, McClearn (1983)
noted “genes can influence voluntary ingestion of ethanol in mice and rats...
this body of knowledge will not only be
pertinent to the question of the extent of
the hereditary influence on alcoholism
but will also inevitably illuminate the

Eigenvalue = 2.97

Eigenvalue = 2.31

nexus of causal mechanisms and thereby
suggests rational therapies and preventive measures.”

The data supporting a heterogeneous
genetic basis for alcoholism imply that
predisposition is mediated by separate
and possibly interacting biological
mechanisms or that all genetic effects
act through the same biological mechanism. Biological responses to alcohol
may serve as markers for such hypothesized genetically controlled mechanisms. Some of these are: (1) alcoholseeking behavior; (2) sensitivity of the
central nervous system (CNS) to ethanol; (3) sensitivity of other bodily systems to ethanol; (4) rate of ethanol me
tabolism or elimination; (5) rate of

acquisition of tolerance to alcohol; (6)

sensitivity and rate of development of
physical dependence on ethanol; and (7)
susceptibility to the medical complications of chronic ethanol consumption
(Sth Report ADAMHA, 19835). Many
biologic marker systems have been assessed. In several studies associations of
blood groups and serum proteins, secretion of AB blood group substance,
phenylthiourea taste sensitivity, and
color vision defects with alcoholism
have been significant, but most often the
associations appear to result from acquired rather than inherited factors
(Swinson, 1983). No significant deviation in HLA distribution of 27 HLA antigens in alcoholics as compared to
healthy blood donors was found in a recent study (Rosler et al., 1983).

A low rate of alcoholism for Orientals has been mentioned. The Oriental

flushing response to alcohol was described by Wolff (1972) as a major ethnic difference in alcohol metabolism.
The enzymes for alcohol and acetaldehyde metabolism exhibit a genetically
determined heterogeneity (isoenzyme
polymorphisms). This may lead to a
wide variety of different enzyme phenotypes (Reed, this volume). Goedde et
al. (1979) suggested a new hypothesis
that racial differences in alcohol sensitivity are due to a polymorphism of liver
aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH).
They found ALDH to show two major
bands, a faster migrating isoenzyme
with a low Km for acetaldehyde and a
slower migrating isoenzyme with a high
Km for acetaldehyde. Twenty-one of

forty livers (53 per cent) of Japanese had

only the slower migrating isoenzyme.
No such phenomenon was found in 68

autopsy livers of Germans. The authors
suggest that initial alcohol sensitivity
might be due to delayed oxidation of acetaldehyde rather than its higher than
normal production by atypical alcohol
dehydrogenase (Goedde et al., 1979). It
may be possible to identify the loci for
these enzyme systems in humans since
two structural loci encoding distinct
isoenzymes of alcohol dehydrogenase
(ADH) and aldehyde reductase (AHRA2) have been located in the mouse ona
gene complex on chromosome 3
(Holmes et al., 1983).

There have been two studies of children at risk for alcoholism (biologic relatives with alcoholism) that measured
acetaldehyde after ethanol ingestion.
One showed elevation of blood acetaldehyde in family-positive subjects as
compared to family-negative subjects
(Schuckit and Rayses, 1979). The other
showed no significant differences in either blood or breath acetaldehyde levels
between children with or without relatives who were alcoholic (Behar et al.,
1983). One possible reason for this discrepancy is that Schuckit’s sample was
older and had used alcohol socially. Alcohol use may induce a different enzymatic response in the older individual at
genetic risk. Another explanation is
methodological differences in the assay
of acetaldehyde in these studies (Eriksson, 1980).

STUDIES OF HIGH-RISK
POPULATIONS

Recent studies of children at risk for
alcoholism have focused attention on
preexisting alterations in central nervous system function prior to extensive
social use of alcohol. Two controlled
evoked response (ER) brain wave stud

ies of children with a family history of alcoholism have demonstrated a significant decrease in ER response to
cognitive tasks (Elmasian et al., 1982;
Begleiter et al., 1984). The reduced amplitude and increased latency of P 300 (a
wave form associated with cognitive attention) in family-history-positive subjects “suggest that they either could not
or would not devote as many resources
to the task. This interpretation is consistent with the behavioral data indicating that family-history-positive subjects
were slower and less accurate in identifying the targets’”’ (Elmasian et al.,
1982). However, two other studies of
spectral brain wave patterns report conflicting findings. Gabrielli et al. (1982)
found that male but not female 11- to 13year-old children at risk for alcoholism
showed an excess of fast beta EEG activity. Propping et al. (1981), on the
other hand, reported patterns of poorly
synchronized EEG wave forms in adult
female alcoholics with reduction of alpha and preponderance of beta activity
and significantly similar patterns in their
relatives; however, this EEG pattern
was not observed in male alcoholics or
their relatives.

Lowered verbal IQ and elevated Halstead Reitan Battery Category Error
Scores are two proposed neurocognitive
antecedent “markers” for children at
risk for the development of alcoholism.
Gabrielli and Mednick (1983), employing the Danish Birth Cohort, demonstrated significantly lowered verbal IQ
in 70 male and female children at risk for
alcoholism as compared to 114 children
without alcoholic parents. Knop et al.
(1984), also using the Danish Birth Registry, found significantly elevated category error scores for 134 males with at
least one parent treated for alcoholism

 
 

 

312

compared to 70 control subjects with no
known alcoholic parent. It has been
demonstrated, however, that social as
well as heavy drinkers had category error scores that were directly proportional to the amount of alcohol consumed per daily occasion (Parker and
Noble, 1977).
Thus far such studies have not examined subjects at risk for alcoholism for
possible separate contributions deriving
from the genetic heterogeneity of the al‘cohol dependence syndrome or from aroO
ifacts caused by early social alcohol use.
® In order to delineate whether neurosognitive and behavioral risk factors in
“alcoholism are antecedent or conseQjuent to alcohol use, it is necessary to
cémploy reliable and valid measures of
zalcohol dependence and other psychoathology, of genetic loading for both
zilcoholism and antisocial personality,
“and of frequency and quantity of current
Zand past alcohol and drug use.
o To illustrate these issues I will report
spn another UCHC study sample: 200
goung adults (92 male and 108 female)
‘Srom the Prospective Study of Children
Cat Risk for Alcoholism. Of these, 103
“are from an “‘at-risk”’ sample of children

Study; 97 are ‘‘control” young adults reScruited for a “health survey” from the
ental Clinic at the same hospital. Risk
of alcoholism in one parent, both parents, or neither parent was determined
by the family history method of ascertainment (M. Hesselbrock et al., 1984).
Diagnostic drinking history was obtained in a similar fashion as in the “‘typology” study sample. The HalsteadReitan Test Battery and the Wechsler
Adult Intelligence Scale were adminis‘tered to assess cognitive abilities. Methods have been described elsewhere (V.
Hesselbrock et al., 19855). Pearson

product-moment correlations and analysis of covariance calculations included:
alcohol use variables; family history of
alcoholism in either father, mother, neither or both parents; diagnosis of alcoholism and ASP; and neuropsychologic
test variables.

When neurocognitive test measures
were compared, there were no significant differences for mean category error scores or for Trails A, Trails B, or
Tactual Perception Test (TPT) total
time for the 17 individuals who were
DSM-III diagnosed alcoholics as compared to moderate and low quantity
drinkers and abstainers (see Table 12).
No significant differences in test scores
were found when they were either corrected or uncorrected for age, full-scale
IQ, and ounces of alcohol drunk in the
six months prior to testing. When subjects were compared as to family history
of alcoholism or ASP diagnosis, there
were no significant differences. Similarly, mean verbal, performance, and
full-scale JQ scores corrected or uncorrected for age and amount of alcohol
consumed were not significantly different for individuals when compared by
drinking style or by whether one parent,
both parents, or neither parent was alcoholic. These data suggest that since category error scores and verbal IQ measures are sensitive to effects of alcohol
consumed at social levels, studies of
high-risk subjects should include control
for all recent alcohol use before attributing any observed difference to antecedent risk for alcoholism.

lution of the DSM J, II, and III criteria
for alcoholism diagnosis. The successive
schema have involved inclusion, exclusion, and then partial inclusion of sociopathic and antisocial behavior in the labeling of alcoholism. Schuckit (1973)
drew attention to the need to separate
sociopathy and alcoholism diagnosis,
but was also one of the first to show the
role that ASP played in the early onset
of alcohol dependence in men and
women (Schuckit et al., 1969; Schuckit
et al., 1970).

If one conceptualizes alcoholism not
as a unitary disorder but as one with
multifactorial determinants, several of
which may be genetic, efforts should be
made to trace the similarities and the
differences in the pathways to alcohol
dependence. In the UCHC sample, two
significant pathways have emerged: one
associated with ASP, and one that is ‘‘familial’”’ (family-history-positive alcoholism).

To become dependent upon alcohol
there must be a choice to drink alcohol
rather than not to drink alcohol. The
multivariate approach to alcohol dependence has suggested at least four rein
forcement contingencies for alcohol use
or avoidance of alcohol use and subsequent dependence (Caddy, 1977). Table 13 lists positive biologic reinforcers
for alcohol use such as “enjoyed the
taste” or “to help one sleep” and positive psychosocial reinforcers for alcohol
use such as “‘just to be sociable” or ‘‘to
relieve boredom.” Negative biologic reinforcers and negative psychosocial re

inforcers that might reduce alcohol use
cover items from “I don’t like the effect
It produces” to ‘‘my parents disapprove” (see Table 14). Subjects in the
UCHC prospective study sample rated
these items in themselves as reasons for
drinking and not drinking. The importance of reinforcement contingencies is
exemplified in the study by Goedde et
al, (1979). Goedde (1978) demonstrated
that a series of negative biologic reinsforcers appeared principally in ‘‘Mon‘“goloids” as compared to “Caucasoids”

seas tachycardia, palpitations, and “hot in

isozyme studies he reviewed, presumably because these isozymes are autoso
mally determined. Female “‘sensitiv
ity,” if such is clearly established, may
derive from another source.

Thus, genetic heterogeneity (isozymes and polymorphisms) may contribute to a variety of individually different isozyme phenotypes for the degradation of acetaldehyde. These factors,
through acetaldehyde-related symptoms, may be potent inhibitors of the
use of alcohol in such variant populations and should be studied in low-risk,
nonalcohol-using subjects and in highrisk family history positives and ASPdisorder individuals.

In the UCHC high-risk and low-risk
subsamples, for those subjects without
alcohol dependence diagnosis, the number of times getting drunk was highly
correlated with ounces of alcohol consumed in the six months before the
study period. Subjects with either father
or mother alcoholic or both parents alcoholic had significantly more often

pared to family-history-negative subjects (X= 1.7, P<0.01). Separate analyses of the main effect of ASP indicated

that those individuals with ASP diagnosis drank to drunkenness more often (X
= 2.8) than did non-ASP subjects (X
= 1.9, P<0.05). The deleterious effect
of alcohol on cognitive tasks was also
observed. Measures of the number of
times getting drunk and the ounces of alcohol consumed were significantly positively correlated (P< 0.01) with category error scores and significantly
negatively correlated (P<0.01) with

verbal and full-scale IQ. Positive and

negative reinforcers listed in Tables 15

and 16 had significant correlations

(P <0.01), respectively, with increased

(r = 0.49) and decreased (r = —0.22)

numbers of days drinking for these non
alcoholic subjects. This suggests the

need for further research on possible

links between genetically controlled di
agnostic and/or enzymatic variables and

drinking patterns.

Two diagnostically different and genetically separate pathways, ASP alcoholism and non-ASP “familial’’ alcoholism, are suggested by these data (see
Tables 9 and 11). Whether there are different mechanisms or whether the two
pathways share a common mechanism
in influencing the onset of alcohol dependence and the consequences of
chronic alcohol abuse is unclear.

The role of conditioning in the development of alcohol dependence in animals has been reviewed by Erwin (this
volume). He describes environment-independent and environment-dependent
conditioned development of tolerance.
Pavlovian models have been proposed
to explain the development and maintenance of substance abuse, including alcoholism. Ludwig (1975) has shown that

are determined by conditioned responses to exteroceptive and interoceptive cues. These cues bring a response of
reawakened “craving” for alcohol and
the return of drinking alcohol with loss
of control as an attempt to reduce the intensity of these cues during a withdrawal
phase. Eysenck and Eysenck (1969)
noted a reduced conditioned learning
ability among social extroverts as compared to introverts; and Lykken (1957)
showed that psychopaths have a slow
conditioning of learned fears or aversions. Social extroversion and psychopathy include more subjective experiences and a wider range of behaviors
than does the more narrow description
of objective behaviors used to describe
antisocial personality. These data suggest that “sociopaths” may learn and
condition differently than nonsociopathic individuals. Further systematic evaluation of possible genetically
determined learning differences in typologies of alcoholism that may be associated with antisocial or sociopathic behavior has implications for treatment.

OUTCOME AND TREATMENT OF
ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE

The arrival of theoretical models of
different typologies of alcoholism and
the increasing logistic ability to deliver
complex treatment programs have
made it possible to provide patientmatching treatment programs at centers
specializing in the treatment of alcoholism beyond the stage of detoxification.
Several well-conducted studies have
demonstrated that alcoholics not suffering from terminal illness have managed
to arrest the progress of their alcohol dependence (Lemere, 1953; Kendall and

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

316

Staton, 1966; Taylor and Helzer, 1983).
Measures of clinical outcome that independently assess family-history-positive
versus family-history-negative alcoholics have not been reported. Alcoholics with ASP appear to have differences in.medical complications, course,
and outcome as compared to non-ASP
alcoholics. A Danish study of 50 criminals with alcoholism and ASP and acontrol group of 42 male non-ASP criminal
alcoholics demonstrated significantly
less physical dependence and fewer
medical complications among alcoholics
with ASP during a time at which alcohol
was readily available (Virkkunen,
1979). In an 8-year follow-up study of
93 unequivocal alcoholic felons, 40 per
cent were in remission and all but two
without psychiatric treatment. Seventy

_per cent of those alcoholics had a socio
pathic diagnosis in addition to alcoholism (Goodwin et al., 1971). Other investigators have noted that ASP behaviors,
if not terminated by death or incarceration, often decreased in intensity by age
30 or 40 (Robins, 1966; Vaillant, 1982).

As most studies suggest that men and
women alcoholics do not enter treatment until the third decade of life, preventive intervention in alcoholism must
come early and must precede formal
treatment. The need for early intervention is further illustrated by the fact that
50,000 Americans are killed each year in
alcohol-related motor vehicle accidents.
At the rate of 10,000 young people per
year, that form of casualty is the leading
cause of death in the 15-24 age group

_(Mayer, 1983). Treatment interven
tions, in the main, have not been. targeted at subtypologies of alcoholics (primary vs. secondary, ASP vs. non-ASP,
early onset vs. late onset, CNS-impaired
vs. nonimpaired). The range of treat
- Stabenau

Social Biology

ment interventions made available to
the undifferentiated alcoholic, as reviewed in a recent federal report, are
listed in Table 16 (5th Report

-ADAMHA, 19832).

Future treatment programs need to
match the clients’ needs, capabilities,
and deficits with the type of treatment.
As an example, Mandell (1981) has described a series of approaches to the specific treatment of alcoholism in sociopathy. The author suggests that the
‘primary sociopath” subtype often enters treatment through intervention by a
spouse, an employer, or the law. These
individuals respond to cognitive treatment that focuses on how alcohol interferes with the subject’s own goals and
ambitions. “Hysteroid” or “neurotic”
sociopaths enter treatment because of
physical illness or fear of insanity in the
form of explosive episodes of violence.

These individuals often respond to
training in management of emotional
upset, especially anger. Their verbal facility is regarded as a hindrance in this
process. “Inadequate” or “cultural” sociopaths enter treatment because of exhaustion of resources. They most often
respond through attachment to nondrinking peer groups and training in lifecoping skills. AA is of particular help to
this group (Mandell, 1981).

SUMMARY

Selected studies and reports have
been reviewed. Data drawn from the
UCHC “typology” study sample and
from the UCHC “prospective” study
sample have been presented. The latter
serve only as guidelines in the description of the natural history of alcoholism.
It is not clear how generalizable results
from volunteer inpatients and outpatients may be in application to the understanding of alcoholism as it exists for
those who are dependent upon alcohol
but never attain formal ascertainment
through any form of treatment. From
these data, some limited statement
about putative genetic factors has been
proposed to promote further etiologic
study and to suggest items for structuring therapeutic programs. Such programs might provide more optimal
matches of patients’ alcohol-related disabilities and vulnerabilities with specific
environmental and biologic treatments.

The following conclusions are principally derived from the UCHC typology
study. Three independent genetically
transmitted factors—sex, family history
of alcoholism, and antisocial personality—appeared to contribute to the
pathogenesis of alcoholism and support
a genetic heterogeneity hypothesis. The

Heredity and Alcohol

 

317

type of family history of alcoholism did
not appear to be related to the natural
course of alcoholism in males or females. Specifically, alcoholics without
alcoholism on either side of the family
(FHN) and probands with alcoholism
on only one side of the family (FHPU)
did not differ in terms of their natural
history of the course of alcoholism or in
terms of the consequences of chronic al
cohol use. However, when compared to

FHN and FHPU probands, alcoholics
with alcoholism on both sides of the
family pedigree (FHPB) experienced
significantly greater impaired control
over drinking behavior and psychological problems associated with chronic alcohol use. Antisocial personality diagnosis was significantly associated with an
earlier onset of the first stages of alcohol
abuse and greater frequency of psychosocial problems associated with chronic
alcohol use as compared to non-ASP alcoholics.

Females began the early stages of alcohol use at an older age than did males,
but they reached the later stages of alcohol addiction at about the same time.
The age of first treatment for alcoholism, however, does not appear to be
significantly influenced by sex of the
subject or by family history or diagnosis
of ASP. Sex of the proband, presence of
ASP, and type of family pedigree for alcoholism have not been found to be interactive but appear to contribute sepa
-rate additive effects to the development

of alcohol dependence.
