ABSTRACT: Acculturation theory suggests that contemporary Africa has been experiencing sociocultural changes (opinions, beliefs, values, and so on) because of the impact of Western culture, especially through the exposure to Western eduction. Based on first-hand data on 117
male Nigerian students attending American colleges and universities at the undergraduate
level, the issue of abortion is raised in terms of (1) whether these students favor or oppose abortion, and (2) what factors are statistically related to abortion. The analysis of the data indicates
that 64.1 per cent of the students are against abortion, 18.8 per cent endorsed abortion, while
17.1 per cent were uncertain. The outcome of varying cross-tabulations and chi-square tests
shows that abortion is statistically related to the number and sex of children. It is also revealed
that marital status, religious preference, and opinion about the present population of Nigeria

are related to abortion.

It is only recently that the question of
abortion, taboo for a good many decades, has become a topic worthy of investigation in contemporary Africa. Observational data regarding abortion in
the African context are increasingly
gathered and analyzed. The purpose of
this study is to investigate opinions regarding abortion among male Nigerian
undergraduate students attending colJeges and universities in the United
States. These opinions are examined in
relation to the following factors: (1) duration of stay in the United States; (2)
opinion about the present population of
Nigeria; (3) opinion about children; (4)
religious preference; (5) number of children; (6) number of male children; (7)
number of female children; (8) Marital
Status.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data reported here were collected from a larger study carried out
among male Nigerian students in the
United States. The purpose of the original study was to investigate the fertility
attitudes of male Nigerian students who
have been exposed to Western education. The section of the questionnaire
pertinent to this report dealt with the tssue of abortion. The 220 male respondents in the larger study represent a
composite of undergraduate and graduate students attending Kansas state taxsupported universities: Emoria State
University, Kansas State University,
Fort Hays State University, Pittsburg
State University, University of Kansas,
and Wichita State University. The data

analyzed here were based on the 117 undergraduate students in the entire sample.

SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SAMPLE

The age characteristics of the respondents at survey showed that 34.4 per
cent were aged 19-24 years, 35.4 per
cent were between 25-30 years, while
30.2 per cent were 31-43 years. The distribution of marital status of the men
was as follows: 45.3 per cent were married, 2.6 per cent were divorced, 51.3
per cent were single, and only 0.8 per
cent indicated that they were separated.
With respect to religious affiliation, 2.6
per cent had no religious affiliation, 27.4
per cent were Muslims, 23.1 per cent
claimed to be Roman Catholic, 46.2 per
cent were Protestant, while 0.7 per cent
belonged to other religious groups. The
average duration of stay of the respondents was 3.7 years. Only 7.7 per cent
had been in the United States for less
than one year, 71.0 per cent had been in
the United States for 1-3 years, 14.5 per
cent for 34 years, and 6.8 per cent for
more than 4 years.

of the respondents toward abortion. An

overwhelming majority of the respondents oppose abortion. In answer to the
question, “In general, do you favor or
oppose abortion?” 64.1 per cent of the
men opposed abortion, 18.8 per cent favored abortion, while 17.1 per cent were
uncertain.

In Table 2, chi-square was used to
test whether there is a relationship between abortion and any of the selected
variables. Based on cross-tabulation
summary, several factors may influence
the respondent’s opinions regarding
abortion. Table 2 reveals that the number of male children a respondent has
may influence his decision to support or
oppose abortion. Equally enough, the
number of female children a respondent
has may influence his decision to endorse abortion (X? = 13.55, d.f. = 8, P
= 0.013).

Nigeria is a society where high premium is placed on male children; hence,
respondents with no male children will
not support abortion. Whether a respondent supports or opposes abortion
is a factor of marital status (X? = 21.69,
d.f. = 6, P = 0.001). Unmarried respondents may tend to oppose abortion
to avoid illegitimacy, while sex prefer

DISCUSSION

In Nigerian society, as in most African states, abortion ts frowned upon. Individual opinions are usually consistent
with the cultural milieu in which they develop. Wherever this sociocultural milieu condemns abortion, individual
members of society tend to oppose
abortion. This, however, does not necessarily mean that abortion is not practiced even by those who are restrictive in
their views. Many of these individuals
would resort to abortion to achieve their
own goals. There is enough evidence to
support the fact that illegal abortion is
frequently practiced in Nigeria in urban
areas and rural areas as well. For example, a survey of medical opinion conducted in Nigeria in 1973, revealed that
abortion is widely practiced illegally. As
Potts et al. (1977, p. 431) observe, “‘the
majority of doctors felt reform would
cut the abortion death rate. Most
wanted the law to be liberalized, and
many believed abortion was more common than any other disease and that
doctors commonly operated, usually for
a fee of about $25.” In any event, illegal
abortion is practiced in Nigeria.

IMPLICATIONS

Nigeria is having a population growth
rate that is relatively high even within
the African context, and yet young Nigerians who are exposed to American

culture, especially liberalized attitudes
and laws regarding abortion, tend to
condemn abortion. Nonetheless, the
fact still remains that there is a discrepancy between their views and opinions
and actual behavior. Whether abortion
is endorsed or opposed, it is practiced.
What is more important in this context is |
the persistence of such opinions among
American-educated Nigerians. It was
expected that the stay in the United
States and exposure to the American
way of life and mainstream culture
would contribute to changes in opinion
toward acceptance (see for example, Inkeles, 1966; Armer and Youtz, 1971;
and Inkeles and Smith, 1974). The findings, however, point to the contrary.
This fact suggests that despite the exposure to Western culture, particularly
through education, initially acquired
values and opinions are often preserved.
It is important to note that perhaps the
exposure of these students has not been
long and profound enough to offset the
persistence of the original world view
among them.

CONCLUSIONS

In spite of the limitations on the size
and scope of the study, the authors believe that this study will be useful not
only as a guide for future studies, but as
a source of information on male opinions concerning the issue of abortionina
male-dominated society. The study
partly reveals the type of attitudes Nigerian students carry with them to their
country. The students in this sample are
of special interest for several reasons:
(1) University students make up a key
group that takes active stands on policy

issues in Nigeria because of their nonpartisan lobby power. (2) They are the
future policy makers of Nigeria, at least
by the virtue of their education. (3)
Their exposure to Western education
must have augmented their awareness
of the impending danger of runaway
population growth in Nigeria.
