Parent Size and Growth Status of Offspring

Parent-offspring studies provide an important tool for assessing, to a limited extent, the magnitude of the genetic control
of human growth. Correlations between the
statures of parents and offpsring are generally significant, suggesting that parental stature contributes to a child’s genetic potential
for growth in height (Garn, 1962; Tanner,
1960; Livson, McNeill, and Thomas, 1962).
With parents classified into various mating
combinations according to their stature,
Garn (1962) noted size differences in offspring in a direction expected from the parental-stature mating combinations. Garn’s
data comprise the first three years of life;
the present data extend Garn’s observation
through middle childhood for American
Negro and white children.

METHODS

Our sample of clinically normal Philadelphia Negro and white school children
numbered 837, 6 through 13 years of age:
216 white males, 168 white females, 210
Negro males, and 243 Negro females. Their
statures were measured to the nearest 0.1
mm. (Malina, 1968), while parental statures
were reported to the nearest one-half inch
on a questionnaire circulated to the parents.
Hence, the study assumes that errors in reported parental heights are randomly dis
tributed and do not cluster at given intervals, due to repeated under- or overestimation. Reported statures were symmetrically distributed, and the mean values agree
favorably with adult stature data from a
variety of sources (Stoudt, Damon, and McFarland, 1960; National Center for Health
Statistics, 1965; Karpinos, 1961).

Parent statures were converted to sex
and race-specific T-scores. These were
grouped into short (S), medium (M), or tall
(T) categories, with the following range for
each (Garn, 1962): T-score below 45, short;
T-score between 45 and 55, medium; Tscore above 55, tall. Parental pairs were
then classified into six mating combinations
according to stature: three homogeneous
(S X S,M XM, T X T) and three heterogeneous (S X M,S X T, M X T) (Gar,
1962). T-scores for the children’s stature
were calculated by their age, sex, and race,
and then grouped according to the parentalstature mating combinations.

RESULTS

Mean T-scores and standard deviations
for children’s stature according to parentalstature mating combinations are presented
in Table 1, T-scores of children gradually
increase from low values for the offspring of
S XS parents to maximum values for offspring of T X T parents. Analysis of vari

ance for each mating type indicated no significant sex and race differences within each.
The data were then combined for both sexes
and races within each parental-stature
mating combination. Analysis of variance
of the combined data indicated significant
differences (p > 0.001) among the six parental-stature combinations.

The data were subsequently analyzed for
independence among means by the Kramer
(1956) extension of the Duncan Multiple
Range Test (Edwards, 1960) to groups of
unequal size. By a series of comparisons
with each pair of means, the significance
of the difference between any specific pair
of means is determined. The extremes of
the mating combinations (S X S, T X T)
are significantly different from each other
and from the other parental-stature mating
combinations (p > 0.05). The remaining
parental-stature mating combinations are
generally similar in mean values, with no
definitive trends in significance. Children of
the M X T parental-stature combinations
are significantly taller than children of S X
M and M X M combinations, but not significantly different from offspring of S KX T
matings. Children of the S X T parentalstature combinations, however, are not significantly taller than children of S X M and
M X M combinations. Similarly, offspring
of SX Mand M X M matings do not differ
significantly from each other.

DISCUSSION

This study demonstrates the significant
role of parent size in determining the size
of their offspring during growth. Tall parents
(T X T) tend to have tall children, while
short parents (S X S) tend to have short
children. The statures of offspring of the
remaining parental mating types (S X M,
S X T, M X M, M X T) are generally
similar and intermediate in value between
the extremes. These observations are consistent for American Negro and white
children of both sexes.

The foregoing results agree favorably
with those for children from birth to three
years of age reported by Garn (1962) (Table
2). The mean T-scores are practically identical for all mating types except M X T.
The M X T mean T-score in the present
study closely approximates the other heterogeneous matings, while it more closely approximates the T X T mating in Garn
(1962).

The ranges of variation within each heterogeneous parent-mating type are generally similar in both studies. On the other
hand, variability within the specific homo

were compared for both age groups in the
three homogeneous mating types. T-scores
for stature show no age effect in offspring
of S X S and M X M combinations. The
mean T-scores of the older age groups are
greater in children of T X T parent mating
types. However, in terms of maturity status
(skeletal age compared to chronological age;
see Malina, 1968) the younger age group is
more advanced than the older age group in
the three homogeneous mating combinations, Consistent age and maturity effects
in our female sample are, therefore, not
evident.

* The data are estimated from Figure 1, p. 51, in eam (1962). The standard deviation and range (+1 S.D.)

represent the limits of the “‘stature variance” in the fi

geneous parent-mating combinations is consistently greater in the present sample than
in Garn’s (1962) series. The age range of our
study is both older and greater (6 to 13
years) than Garn’s (birth to 3 years)
series. Offspring of different parental mating
types undoubtedly include children who are
at different stages of growth and maturity.
Further, some of the children in the present
sample are probably in or entering adolescence, with its characteristic variability.
This would be especially true of girls. To
evaluate the possibility of age and maturity
effects in our female samples, we arbitrarily
divided them into two age groups, 6 to 9
years and 10 to 13 years. T-scores for stature

SUMMARY

The relationship between parent size and
the stature of their offspring was considered
in a cross-sectional sample of American
Negro and white children 6 through 13
years of age. Parents were classified into
six mating combinations according to their
stature. Analysis of the children’s stature
by parental-stature mating combinations
indicated a well-defined trend related to
parent size from short to tall for white and
Negro children of both sexes.
