Child Mortality, Social Status,
and Fertility in India

K, P. Singh

Department of Sociology,
Punjab University,
Chandigarh, India

It is generally maintained that the incidence of mortality is greatly influenced
by the social status of any group. People
of higher social status have lower mortality rates because of better knowledge of
the availability and use of medical facilities and an easy access to expensive
medical aid. Moreover, they are more concerned about sanitary conditions and hygiene than the people of lower social status.

Incidence of mortality is also believed
to be related to fertility, and it is maintained that when the child mortality rate
is high, fertility also goes up because
parents produce more offspring to ensure
the survival of a few. Evidence of this fact
can be had from Indian census data on
birth and death rates during the past century. From 1871, when the first census
was taken in the country, until 1931, the
growth rate was very small and in some
cases it was nearly nil, mainly because the
birth and death rates were both very high.

This paper analyzes the incidence of
child mortality in relation to the social
status and fertility of Indian women. Social status has been taken as an independent variable, child mortality as a
dependent variable, and fertility as an in
 

tervening variable. It is based on the assumptions that (a) the higher the social
status, the lower will be the incidence of
child mortality, and (b) the lower the incidence of child mortality, the lower will
be the family size.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The study includes 311 married women
living in Chandigarh. These women were
divided into four status categories: (1)
higher educated working women; (2)
higher educated nonworking women; (3)
less educated nonworking women; and
(4) less educated working women. The
higher educated categories were comprised
of women who had completed ten or more
years of schooling; the less educated categories, of women with less than ten years
of schooling, including the barely literate
and illiterate. There were 95 women in
Category 1, 75 in Category 2, 75 in Category 3, and 66 in Category 4.

Since education is one of the important
indices of social status, it is evident that
the higher educated women are higher in
status than the less educated or illiterate.
However, the same kind of ranking cannot
be made for occupational prestige, as the

nonworking women cannot be placed on
any continuum of occupational prestige.
Among higher educated women, women in
the working category were more highly
educated than the women in the nonworking category. On the other hand, among
less educated women, the educational level
was lower among working than among the
nonworking women.

Education was the only variable by
which the women could be ranked into
status categories. However, husband’s
status was a common factor to all women.
Therefore, it was proposed to take the
indices of husband’s status, ie., their occupational status, their educational attainments, and their economic position. A
status index consisting of these three variables was prepared.

The criterion for the measurement-ofstatus index was adopted from Centers
(1949). Accordingly, educational attainments, occupations, and income of the
husbands were divided into seven groups,
and an individual’s score was obtained in
each case by adding the numerical values
assigned to each of these three indices.

The average score was the highest for
husbands of higher educated working
women and the lowest for husbands of
less educated working women. Husbands
of women in the other two categories were
also in the same ranking order as their

wives. Thus, the husbands’ status index
corresponded to the wives’ educational
ranking. The mortality analysis was made
in relation to these four status categories.

FINDINGS

In the total sample, the 311 women gave
birth to a total of 1,075 children of which
960 were living and 115 had died, most
between the ages of 0-5 years. In terms
of percentage, 89 per cent of the children
were living. However, the percentage was
different in each status category. In the
first and highest category, 93 per cent of
the total children born were living; in the
second status category, 92 per cent; in the
third category, 91 per cent; and in the
fourth status category, 81 per cent.

Table 1 clearly shows the relationship
between child mortality and social status
and the number of ever-born children and
the number of survivors. In the fourth category, the incidence of mortality is the
highest so that the number of survivors is
much lower than in the third category.
The relationship between child mortality
and social status becomes still more clear
when analyzed by the proportion of women
who had Jost children in each status category.

In the first and highest category, 87 per
cent of the women had not experienced
any child mortality in their family; of the

remaining, 12 per cent had lost one child
each, whereas only 1 per cent had lost
two children irrespective of the number of
children born to them. There was no incidence of mortality among women who
had only one liveborn child.

In the second category, 77 per cent had
lost no liveborn child; 20 per cent had lost
one child each; and another 3 per cent
had lost two children each, irrespective of
the number of children born to them. Here
again, there was no incidence of mortality
among women who had one liveborn child;
but compared to the first category, the
number of such women was small.

The percentage of women experiencing
no mortality declines further in the third
category where 72 per cent had lost no
children; 20 per cent had lost one child
each; 7 per cent had lost two children
each; and 1 per cent had lost four children.

The percentage of women having experienced no child mortality dropped sharply
in the last category of less educated working women. Only 48 per cent had not lost
any child, whereas the remaining 52 per
cent had lost one, two, or more than two
children.

Mortality, Social Status, and Fertility

Our assumption that the higher the social status, the lower the incidence of mortality is clearly supported by these findings.

As far as the relationship between fertility and mortality is concerned, in the
first and highest status category the incidence of mortality was the lowest and the
mean number of children born was also
the lowest. In the second category, the incidence of mortality was a little higher
than the first category and the mean number of children was also higher. This trend
did not continue for fertility in the third
and the fourth categories, although the
incidence of mortality did continue in the
same hierarchical order. The incidence of
mortality was the highest in the fourth
and lowest category; but fertility was not
the highest because there were five women
who had no children although they had
been married for 6 to 9 years and there
were four recently married women, two of
whom were pregnant at the time of the
survey. Had these exceptions not existed,
the fertility of the fourth group would have
been the highest.

mortality and fertility in the four status
categories. It is clear from the totals column that the percentage of children
claimed by death was the lowest when
women had one to two liveborn children.
With a few exceptions, with the same number of live births, variation in different
categories is also according to the hierarchical order of status categories. It appears

that a lowered mortality rate is also accompanied by a lowered fertility rate.

In summary, it may be concluded that
the incidence of child mortality greatly
depends upon social status; the higher
the social status, the lower the incidence
of mortality. In addition, when the incidence of mortality is lower, fertility is
also lower.
