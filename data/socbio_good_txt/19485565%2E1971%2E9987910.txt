Family Planning among Health Clinic

Patients in Barbados

Barbados, a small Caribbean island (166
square miles) with a population of about a
quarter of a million and a density of over
1,500 per square mile, has undergone in
recent times significant social and economic
development. This development is reflected
in its family-planning program, its low
death rate, and its moderate and declining
birth rate. Even though Barbados is still
among the less developed nations of the
world, its high literacy rate (98%) and its
good transport and communication systems
point to significant advances on the road
to social and economic development.

With a good health service operating hospitals and clinics, the low death rate is not
surprising. With a family-planning program
operating through health clinics for the past
fourteen years, the declining birth rate is
not totally unexpected. This birth rate has
been declining from 33 per thousand in 1960
down to about 22 in 1968. How did this
decline come about? Unfortunately, all the
data needed for answering this question are
not available. However, this paper presents
some indicators of what is happening to the
patients who attend health clinics and
therefore come in contact with the familyplanning workers. Attention will be given

 

to the reasons stated for not using a contraceptive method and to accidental pregnancies, miscarriages, birth intervals, the
spacing and stopping of pregnancies, and
other areas which may be indicative of the
nature of the success of family planning.

THE DATA

The data of this study were obtained in
1967 on a sample of women selected from
the patients of the Population Council Research Project (PCRP). The PCRP was
established in 1965 as an affiliate of the
Barbados Family Planning Association
(BFPA) and operated until December 1967.
The PCRP offered free Papanicolaou smears
and Lippes loops (an intrauterine device),
while the BFPA ran a “cafeteria style”
family-planning program offering all forms
of contraceptive devices. All IUCD acceptors were members of both the BFPA
and the PCRP. All women who were contraceptors and had obtained a smear test
were members of both organizations. Women who had a smear test but were not contraceptors were members of the PCRP
only. Women who were contraceptors but
did not have a smear test were members of
the BFPA only.

A sample of 600 patients of the PCRP
was chosen which yielded the 461 interviews
that are the source of data for this paper.
(The PCRP’s primary goal was an examination of the relationship between IUCD’s
and cervical carcinoma.) The sample was
chosen, using an electronic computer, in
such a way as to yield almost equal numbers
of present IUCD users and current nonusers of the IUCD. At the time of the drawing of the sample, the admission and followup records of these patients were stored on
punched-cards and electronic tapes. A systematic sample of present IUCD users was
chosen and a nonuser next in identification
number to the user was also chosen as a
control. In this way a systematic sample
was obtained stratified by IUCD status,
clinic, and time of admission into the program. The patients of the sample were
interviewed either at the clinic or at home
by well-trained and experienced interviewers. Many attempts were made to interview all the sample units, and the outcome is shown in Table 1.

A goal of five hundred completed interviews was set, but for a number of reasons
only 461 were obtained. Comparisons with
the parent population showed that this
sample of 461 is representative on certain
key demographic variables and therefore
the missing units have not biased the sample.
This sample, the same one used in this
study, had as one of its goals a reliabilityvalidity check on the data obtained on the
population of about fifteen thousand patients. Consequently, great care was taken

to ensure that data of a high quality were
obtained. There is every reason to believe
that the extra effort accomplished this task.
While the data were not collected to focus
directly on family planning; they allow us
to examine certain family-planning behavior of these women.

FINDINGS

Before we examine the indicators of
family-planning effectiveness, a few preliminary observations are in order. This
sample is representative of the PCRP population which is a subsample of the PFPA
clients and to a certain extent typical of
Barbadian women of lower socioeconomic
status. Twelve per cent of this sample had
never used a contraceptive method and consequently never had been admitted to the
BFPA. Also, 2.6% of these 461 women had
never been pregnant, and 7.8% had no
partner or husband at the time. The average
number of contraceptive methods used by
these women is 2 when the 56 nonusers
are excluded, and 1.8 when they are not.
There is a considerable amount of changing
of methods, and the reasons for not using a
method may point to contraceptive effectiveness or lack of it.

REASONS FOR NOT USING METHODS

In Table 2 are presented the reasons given
for changing from one method to another.
The category “No reason” accounts for
only a very small percentage. Among the
patients of the sample, there is strong indication that as the order of the method is
increased, the percentage of women that
continue using it is also increased. This may
be reflecting two things. First, the higherorder method has been in use for a shorter
period and therefore a lower drop-out rate
is expected. Second, the higher the order,
the larger the percentage of users of the
newer more reliable methods, which so far
have showed signs of retaining a larger
percentage of users than the traditional

methods. If a woman goes on to more than
one method, she is less likely to drop out,
at least in a short time. It should be pointed
out that 74.3% of the women in the sample
who have used a contraceptive method report the IUCD as the method or one of the
methods they have used.! It is known that
the IUCD’s were all inserted since June,
1965 (a relatively short period), and that
up to the time of the interview, 62.9% of
these IUCD’s were still in place.

The number of women reporting a method failure is relatively high, but in the expected direction when the pattern of irregular usage and the level of reliability of
the methods used are taken into account.
Even a very reliable method like the pill
becomes very unreliable when not used
regularly and as directed.

Dislike for a method accounts for some
method changing. A small number of women
who were using contraception to space
their pregnancies gave up a method in order to have another baby. A sizable proportion of women changed from one method to another because they wanted to try a
new method, These are women who are like
1 This high proportion of IUCD users should not
be surprising if it is remembered that the PCRP was
an IUCD study and even though IUCD acceptors
were not over-sampled, they were easier to locate
and interview and consequently comprise a large
proportion of the sample.

ly to increase the reliability of the method
used with this change. They are continuing family planning, but they are searching
for a more satisfactory method. Medical
complications are the most frequently cited
reason for discontinuing use of an ITUCD.
It is also the main reason given for not
using an oral pill. The increase in the percentage, across methods, giving medical
complications as a reason for discontinuing
use reflects the prevalence of the [UCD
and pill as methods of higher order of use.
Contrary to popular beliefs, women do
not see their partners as influential in
their decisions to use or not to use a
method. All in all, the reasons given for
not using a method are good indicators of
the diffusion process as well as the effectiveness of the program as mirrored by
method usage.

ACCIDENTAL PREGNANCY

In addition to asking women for their
reasons in discontinuing a method, the interviewer also asked if they had in fact had
an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy while
using the methods they claimed to have
used. The percentage distribution of those
who experienced accidental pregnancies
while using a contraceptive are given in

nancies are very high. The vaginal users
show the highest rate, as would be expected,
but the number of accidental pregnancies is
certainly unexpected. The pattern of usage
of contraception among the clients of the
family-planning program shows a very high
failure rate, supposedly of the method.
Failure in this situation is due much more
to the way the method is used than to the
method itself. Even the most unreliable of
the methods in the program can be very
successfully used if the client is highly
motivated and uses it as directed.

The oral contraceptive pill users also experienced a high failure rate among these
women. This, too, is not wholly unexpected.
The pill, if not used properly and regularly,
may in fact increase the fecundability of
the woman. A program could be increasing
the risk of pregnancy of its clients by issuing
the oral pills without some assurance that
they are being used as directed. One should
remember that they are the same fertility
pills given to subfecund women with the
directions to take them for a specified
period and then stop. This procedure increases a woman’s chances of conception.
As can be seen, the IUCD has the lowest
failure rate. Once it is in place, no motivation is needed to insure its proper use. If
the IUCD is not in place, a pregnancy cannot be attributed to it as a failure.

On admitting an accidental pregnancy,
the women in the sample were further

asked for their opinion as to what was responsible. The answers are recorded in
Table 4. Method 4 is not included, since
there are too few women admitting an accidental pregnancy while using a fourth
method. An increasing percentage of the
women by method order believed that
their pregnancy was due to some aspect
of the method itself and not any fault of
their own. Not taking a pill every day or a
partially expelled IUCD, both resulting in
pregnancies, may be attributed to defects
in the methods by these women. The latter
is tenable, but the former is not. It is hardly
likely that most of the accidental pregnancies are due to defects in the methods themselves. What is much more probable is
that the methods were not used properly,
and in a majority of cases the pregnancies
are due to defects in application.

It is encouraging to see that “out of

supplies” is given as a reason less frequently
as the order of the method used is increased.
Those who go on to one or more methods
after the first are less likely to become pregnant because they ran out of supplies. Over
a quarter of the women who claimed to
have had an accidental pregnancy attributed it to the fact that they were not using
the method at the time. They simply took a
chance and became pregnant. This percentage does not differ very much by the
order the method was used. Some women
also admitted using the method at the time
pregnancy occurred, but not using it as they
were told. What is evident in the analysis
is a need for diffusion of the significance of
using the methods correctly as well as information on their proper use.

MISCARRIAGES

A miscarriage was defined within the
PCRP as any pregnancy which is terminated
within twenty weeks after conception.
Therefore, miscarriages include both voluntary and involuntary abortions. It is safe
to assume that a substantial number of the
recorded miscarriages are induced abortions.
It is believed that the abortion rate on
the island is high, This is indicated by informal reports of the number of beds occupied in the hospitals by cases of complications resulting from attempted and improperly performed abortions. Induced abortion is illegal, and therefore it would be
very difficult to get reliable information on
it. However, it is believed that by obtaining
information on miscarriages information
on abortions is indirectly gained.

From the data of the PCRP sample,
it is seen that the number of pregnancies
among the clients is positively related with
the number of miscarriages (Gamma =
0.45).2 The mean number of miscarriages
per woman in the sample is 0.44 with 0.84
standard deviation. The interest in miscarriages in this section stems from an interest in abortions as an indicator of a high

ne

level of motivation towards family limitation. It has been recorded in some studies
that following closely upon the launching
of a family-planning program, the number
of induced abortions has a tendency to
increase, but it eventually levels off at a
lower rate than that existing before the introduction of the program (Glass, 1965;
Tietze, 1965; Klinger, 1966; Maramatsu,
1966). The increase is due mainly to the
fact that in motivating a population toward
birth control by spreading the idea of preventing the unwanted pregnancy, one is
inadvertently motivating the population to
get rid of accidental pregnancies. When
women begin to use a contraceptive method,
many become pregnant due to improper use
of the contraceptive in this early stage of
the innovation. However, the women had
made up their minds that they did not
want another pregnancy at this time and
therefore resort to abortions. In Barbados,
the admitted failure is high, and it is suspected that the abortion rate is high too.
Therefore, many of the accidental pregnancies probably end up as miscarriages in
the early stages of pregnancy, an indication
of the program’s indirect effect upon family
limitation on the island.

In Table 5 the birth intervals of six
months or less between two consecutive
pregnancies are presented with the time in
the woman’s reproductive history when
she began using a contraceptive method.
Methods 3 and 4 were not included in
Table 5 because of the small numbers of
women involved. The boldface percentages in Table 5 show quite clearly that where
either Method 1 or Method 2 was accepted
after the mth pregnancy, there occurred a
large percentage increase in the number of

pregnancies of the (7 -+- 1) order in which
the interval between 2 and (n+ 1) was
less than six months. This is the range in
which any terminated pregnancy would
have to be a miscarriage. An interval! of less
than six months between two consecutive
pregnancies is virtually a sure indication
that the most recent is a miscarriage. It
must be the case that this later pregnancy
was terminated four months or less after
the conception since the minimum period
of post-partum amenorrhea after the earlier
of the two pregnancies must be taken into
account. This increase in miscarriages occurring following acceptance of a contraceptive method is a strong indication of an
increase in the number of abortions. This
leads to the conclusion that when there is an
accidental pregnancy following adoption
of family planning, there is a high probability that there will be a resort to induced
abortion. In this way, a program in family
planning is indirectly correcting its own errors.
BIRTH INTERVALS

The length of the birth interval also is
an indication of the effectiveness of family
planning, especially in the case where
family planning is being used as a device
for spacing children. However, it is quite

another matter when family planning is
used to stop pregnancy altogether after
the number of children desired has been
attained or exceeded.

No significant differences are observed
in the birth intervals of women in this
study when intervals before and after
adoption of contraceptives are compared.
What differences are observed are accounted
for by age, number of pregnancies, and the
number of months babies are breast fed.
Should it be concluded then that family
planning in Barbados is used exclusively
to stop conception rather than in combination with spacing? When the women in
this sample were asked for what purpose
they began using contraceptives, 156 of the
461, or 33.8%, replied that they wished to
space their pregnancies, while 54.1% said
they wanted no additional pregnancies.
The remaining 12.1% were women who
have never used a contraceptive method.
In view of this finding, some differences between the birth intervals before and after
adoption of family planning might be expected, but none were found. Cross-tabulations were used to control for the time at
adoption of the method, reason for beginning use, the number of methods used, and
the times at which the methods were used.

Vol. 18, No. 2

Using stepwise regression analysis, we
made an attempt to see what variables
account for variation in the average birth
interval. Because of the way the data were
coded only women with six or less pregnancies were included in this analysis. If a
woman had more than six pregnancies the
first four were coded and then the “second
to last” and “the last” which meant that
for women of seven or more pregnancies,
calculating the average birth interval is
problematic except for the first four and the
two last ones. The open-ended birth interval
since the last pregnancy was excluded from
the calculation. The variables selected as
independent variables were selected on the
two criteria that they had to be interval
scales and that they were likely to influence
the birth interval. The variables thrown into
the analysis appear in the following paragraph.

The variance with respect to the average
birth interval is 71% accounted for by the
present age of the woman (X})’, her age at
first pregnancy (X2), the number of months
the second child was breast fed (X3), the
number of months the third child was
breast fed (X4), and the age of the mother
at the last pregnancy (Xs). Individually,
these variables, (X1~X5), account for 49%,
14%, 4%, 3%, and 1% of the variance
respectively. The prediction equation relating the average birth interval (Y) and the
five above-mentioned independent variables
(X1-X5) is Y= —5.6 + 0.87X) — 0.37Xe +
0.54X3; + 0.10X;,. It is interesting to note
that both the number of months the second
child was breast fed and the number of
months the third child was breast fed are
included in the equation, but not the number of months the first child was breast
fed. The reason for this is not obvious. It

4 This is in keeping with findings in other studies
such as Potter et al. (1965), Sheps and Menken
(1969), and Sheps and Perrin (1964) and the factors
they found accounting for this fact such as increasing
pregnancy wastage, lengthening of menstruating
intervals, and longer post-partum amenorrhea.

143

could be that there is very little variation
in the number of months the first child was
breast fed. The number of pregnancies is
correlated highly with the average birth
interval (r = 0.69). The number of pregnancies correlated with the number of
months breast-fed for each child from the
first to the last, with r = 0.17, 0.37, 0.45,
0.52 up to the fourth and r = 0.58 and
0.59 for the second to the last and the last
child.

There is no doubt that pregnancies occur
among the users of the facilities of the family-planning program and that eventually as
the influence of the program becomes more
pronounced that differences will occur between the birth intervals before and after
acceptance of contraception. However, with
the small sample used in this study and the
haphazard use of contraception among
clients, it is not surprising that we failed
to detect the influence of contraception on
the birth intervals for either the spacers or
the unsuccessful stoppers.

SPACING AND STOPPING

When a woman decides to practice contraception, we can assume that she has
come to a decision on the basis of either not
wanting another pregnancy or not wanting
it at that time. The former group of women
will be referred to as “stoppers” and the
latter as “spacers.” The patients of the
PCRP sample were classified under these
two headings, and then within each of these
two groups the relationship between parity
at the time of acceptance and parity at the
time the patient was interviewed was investigated. In this way it is possible to find
out if there is a difference in terms of change
in parity after acceptance between the two
groups of women. Ideally, those women who
claimed they began contraception for the
purpose of stopping further conception
should increase their parity much less than
those who did so for spacing their pregnancies. Some stoppers may be expected to inDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:54 08 December 2015

144 Ebanks

crease their parity through accidental pregnancies and some by changing their minds
about further pregnancies; but overall there
should be less parity change than among the
spacers. These two groups (spacers and
stoppers) are divided further into groups
according to the number of methods they
have used.

There is a strong positive relationship
between parity at first use of contraception
and parity at the time of interview for
spacers who have used one method. The
strength of this relationship as measured by
Gamma is 0.86 (see Table 6). If there was
no change of parity, a Gamma of 1.00 would
have resulted. For spacers who have used
two methods, the strength of the relationship between the same two variables is
0.74; for three-method users it is 0.65; and
for four-method spacers it is down to 0.24.
For the stoppers, these same coefficients
of association are 0.93, 0.79, 0.80, and 0.68,
respectively. The same interpretation applies in both cases. It would appear that
stoppers have increased their parities far
less than spacers. This is in the expected
direction and strongly points to a measure
of success among this group of women in
planning their families.

A question that may be asked, however,
is what accounts for the varying degrees of
strength of association for spacers as the
number of methods used is increased? This

phenomenon is also present among the
stoppers. Here the crucial variable would
appear to be time. The number of methods
used reflects the length of time in the program, and therefore the more time there is
for the parity at the time of interview to
diverge from parity at the time at which
contraception was first used. In general, it
may be asserted that there is some difference between spacers and stoppers in terms
of the increase in parities after the start of
contraception. For each group, the strength
of the relationship between parity at the
start of contraception and current parity
decreases with the number of methods
used. This decrease is a reflection of the
cumulative effect of time as measured by
the number of methods used by the women.
The more methods used, the longer the
length of time contraception is in use and
therefore the higher the probability of increasing the parity. As an indication of effectiveness, this analysis points in the direction
of some success.

When the purpose for which contraception was begun is not taken into account and
the parity at the time of acceptance of the
first method is compared with the number
of pregnancies at the time of interview, a
Gamma of 0.77 is observed. The parity at
the time of acceptance of Method 1 and
the parity at the time Method 1 was discontinued yield a Gamma of 0.58. The
first coefficient reflects a relatively small
change in parity over the period of use of
contraception, while the second indicates a
change in parity without an accompanying
change in the method used. This may point
to a situation in which women who are

68 women who used a new method in the
twelve months prior to the interview. Of
these women, 17.6% did not use any
method before, 29.4% had been using a
vaginal method and 1.5%, 2.9%, 5.9%, and
42.7% had been using the diaphragm, the
condom, the pill, and the IUCD, respectively (see Table 7). There is a lambda (V—-H)
of 0.55 between what was being used before
the change that took place in the twelve
months prior to the interview and the
method that was accepted for use. It is
interesting to note that of those who
changed a method in the last year prior to
the interview, almost equal numbers accepted the vaginals, the pills, and the IUCD.
It is seen that vaginals gained as many as
they lost, while the pill gained many more
than it lost, and the IUCD lost more than it
gained in the changing of methods during
the twelve months prior to the collection
of the data. Of the 66 women in Table 7,
only twelve were new to the program; the
others were shifting around from one
method to another. A vast majority of the
sample (85%) had not accepted a new contraceptive in the last year. The reasons
given for changing methods are similar to
those mentioned previously. However, it
should be noted that 8.3% of the women
changed their method because they had
become pregnant while using the particular
method.

The women in the sample were asked to
name the method of contraception they
liked best and the results are presented in
Table 8. A majority of women claimed to
like the IUCD the best and were using it.
This is as expected. It might be noted that
the interviewers were associated with the
PCRP, which actively promoted the IUCD.
It seems likely that the IUCD is preferred
because it was the method currently in use.
Only 36.4% of those who claimed they
liked the vaginals were using one of them;
in the case of the diaphragm, the percentage
is even lower. In contrast, 59.6% and 76.8%
of those who liked the pill and the IUCD,
respectively, were using them. There is
considerable opportunity for getting patients to change, particularly to methods
they prefer. Why they are not using the
preferred method is not clear. There is only
a moderate positive relationship between

the method liked best and the method now
in use (Gamma = 0.64). By getting women
to use the method liked best, the program
may succeed in decreasing the irregularity
of use and therefore improve its effectiveness.

THE IUCD

At this point, a closer examination of
IUCD use is in order. As shown previously,
the IUCD acceptors constitute an overwhelming majority of the women in the
sample. Over 65% of the sample had an
IUCD inserted. At the time of the interview, 62.9% of these IUCD’s were still in
place, 22.2% had been removed and 14.9%
had been expelled. The drop-out rate can be
considered normal for this method in the
time period involved. In fact, it may be
even lower than rates evidenced in other
IUCD programs (Mauldin, Nortman, and
Stephan, 1967). The retention rates for
IUCD programs range from 62.9% to
80.7% with re-insertions; and from 44.3%
to 69.1% without re-insertions after eighteen
months; and from 43% to 65% without reinsertions after 24 months (Mauldin et al.,
1967). The Barbados program was in existence for over twenty-four months at the
time of this study.

The reasons for removal of IUCD’s were
investigated. Some kind of medical complication was given as the reason for removal in
82.4% of the cases. In the removal of
IUCD’s the partners of the women played

Social Biology

a part. These women reported that 8.8%
of the IUCD removals took place because
their husbands or partners insisted on its
removal. These men may not be opposed
to contraception; rather, it is believed that
their objection is to the IUCD. The knowledge that an IUCD is in situ may lead to a
complaint of uncomfortableness during intercourse on the part of the partner.
Another 8.8% of the women who had IUCD
removals reported that this was done because of pregnancy while using the method.
This percentage is almost equivalent to
the 8.3% of the women who reported that
they had changed their method in the
twelve months prior to the interview because they became pregnant.

The distribution of IUCD acceptors by
parity is given in Table 9. There is no
evidence that the IUCD appealed primarily
to high-parity women. Indeed, wide appeal
is common among women at all parities.
Zero-parity women are an exception, but
this may be explained by the fact that an
IUCD was offered by the PCRP only to
women with at least one pregnancy. However, private physicians may have experimented with a few zero-parity women.
Women with only one pregnancy are underrepresented among the IUCD acceptors,
but from that parity upward there is little
difference in the relative distribution of
IUCD acceptors by parity. It is clear that
there is still much more room to promote
it further as a contraceptive method. The

IUCD is especially effective in populations
of the type found in Barbados, where it
has been seen to be so difficult to ensure
proper and continuous use of self-administered contraceptive methods.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Sample survey data have been used to
search for indications of family-planning
effectiveness among the patients of health
clinics on the island of Barbados. The interviewing of the sample of 461 patients
took place in 1967. From the data pre

sented, it seems safe to say that the familyplanning program is having some effect upon
the fertility behavior of the Barbadian
women. There is every reason to believe
that this program in family limitation is
playing a major role in the recent declines
in the crude birth rates. It also seems that
the program is increasing its effectiveness
and should make its impact felt even more
in the future. Further research is necessary
in order to realize the full ramifications of
this fourteen-year-old program on the fertility behavior of the women on the island.
