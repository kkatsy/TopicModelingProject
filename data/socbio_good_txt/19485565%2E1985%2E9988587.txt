ABSTRACT: As early as 1973 Fletcher documented moral problems families encountered as they
struggled with the decision of whether or not to have amniocentesis. In this study we asked 202
women accepting and 50 women rejecting amniocentesis extensive questions about religious
beliefs, behaviors, and beliefs about abortion. Members of small Protestant denominations were
the most conservative. Catholics and other Protestants were intermediate with smaller differences between these middle groups. Those respondents claiming no religion or one of a nonChristian denomination were the most liberal. Net predictors of acceptance of amniocentesis
included respondents’ support for laws permitting abortion for medical reasons, negative responses about belief in the sanctity of life, having insurance, and the respondents’ political
affiliation. Education and religious attendance were the most consistent net predictors‘of moral
attitudes. We concluded that the amniocentesis decision is influenced by many religious béliefs
but is not completely determined by these.

In one of the first publications about that the overriding difficulty with amfamilies’ responses to amniocentesis, niocentesis is an objection to abortion

omy to make reproductive decisions
(Fletcher, 1981), and when there was a
lowering of risks associated with having
amniocentesis (Verp and Gerbie, 1981;)
Williamson et al., 1984). However, in
presenting this decision-making process
as a strict dichotomy, Sell et al. (1978)
oversimplified the issues involved in
prenatal diagnosis. Further, they ignored other influences that may be
equally important.

Most of the early studies of attitudes
toward amniocentesis were based on
small samples of families who had had a
child with a trisomy disorder (Black,
1979) or another chronic genetic illness
(Leonard et al., 1972; Lubs, 1979) and
sought to determine reproductive attitudes and behaviors in such couples.
Study groups also included individuals
at risk of having a child with a genetic
disease which could not be prenatally diagnosed using amniocentesis. These
studies revealed a mixed reaction to the
availability of amniocentesis. In a study
of parents with children with chronic genetic diseases, Leonard et al. (1972)
found that reproductive attitudes were
determined by the parents’ perception
of the burden of care for their child. Although these parents showed some preference for selective abortion as a means
of preventing the birth of an affected
child their first preference was for voluntary sterilization. In Lubs’ (1979) study
of parents of children with hemophilia
and muscular dystrophy, only the parents in the intermediate risk categories
had “moral” objections to prenatal diagnosis and selective abortion.

A study by Black (1979) found that
parents of mentally retarded children either due to Down’s syndrome or of unknown etiology had similar reproductive attitudes. Although half of the

Social Biology

parents were against abortion in general, the majority said they would accept
amniocentesis for prenatal diagnosis.
One family in this latter category would
not abort if the fetus were found to be
defective. Two families said they would
not have further children if amniocenteSis were not available, while another two
families said they would refuse amniocentesis altogether. Black noted that all
families could justify their decisions either to have more children or to accept
or reject amniocentesis. However, these
justifications could only be described as
reflecting motivations and not clear cut
(rational) decisions.

In studies specifically related to
groups having amniocentesis, Davies
and Doran (1982), Robinson et al.
(1975), and Finley et al. (1977) stated
that all women having amniocentesis
were seriously concerned with the probability that they would decide whether
or not to abort the affected fetus. Others, Lippman-Hand and Piper (1981),
Dixson et al., (1981), Verp and Gerbie
(1981), and Antley (1976), listed a multitude of factors influencing whether
women would have amniocentesis or
not. These included respondents’ perception of the burden of raising an affected child, the costs of the amniocentesis procedure, as well as religious
beliefs. However, there was no estimation of the differential strengths of these
factors in influencing the subjects’ decision about amniocentesis.

More recently, studies have described the amniocentesis decision as a
balancing of ideological and practical
considerations against the commitment
to the fetus (Rothman, 1985; Burke
and Kolker, 1984). Along these lines,
respondents who see their decision to
have prenatal diagnosis as synonymous

with the decision to abort an affected fetus have more difficulty in accepting amniocentesis and in justifying their decisions (see also Robinson et al., 1975).
However, generalizing from this research is made difficult due to small sample sizes, unrepresentative sampling,
and a reliance on bivariate analyses.
These studies do not explain how some
factors are weighed against others and
do not specify the decision-making process itself. Moreover, they fail to clarify
the aspects of moral and religious attitudes and behaviors that influence the
decision about accepting amniocentesis
or not.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
THE Data SAMPLE

Two hundred and two women were
recruited from all women coming to the
University of Iowa for amniocentesis
between July, 1981, and June, 1983.
This represents approximately onethird of the women having amniocentesis at Iowa City during the period of
study. The 50 women refusing amniocentesis were recruited statewide. The
sampling techniques and the representativeness of the study samples have been
described previously in detail (Ekwo et
al., 1985).

Women accepting amniocentesis
were generally interviewed in a private
room reserved for the study to allow for
confidentiality. The interview was conducted by one of us (BS), prior to their
amniocentesis procedure. The women
rejecting amniocentesis were interviewed at an appropriate place and time
of the respondents choosing to allow for
privacy and confidentiality. The interviews were scheduled after the women

 

Amniocentesis Decision 15

had decided to refuse amniocentesis to
avoid interfering with their decision.
This worked out to be between the 18th

and 22nd weeks of gestation. Very few

women in either group refused to participate in this study.

The questionnaire was structured
and sought information on complete demographic, reproductive, and genetic
history, attitudes toward birth control,
abortion, and family planning. Also included were questions about knowledge
of genetic defects, genetic risks, political
party affiliation, commitment to career,
religious preference, and church attendance.

Respondents verbally answered each
question, and all information, both the
specific response and any voluntary responses, were recorded by the research
assistant. Each respondent was given a
card which had the possible response
choices, and they were instructed to select the responses which best applied to
them. If subjects failed to understand a
question, it was reread to them without
prompting, rephrasing, or explaining
the questions to avoid bias. Each interview session took approximately 1 hour
with a range of 35 minutes to 2 hours.
Respondents were very cooperative and
we had very little missing data. No question was refused by more than four respondents and no systematic nonresponse patterns were found.

ATTITUDE MEASUREMENT

Questions relating to many aspects of
religiosity and morality were included in
the questionnaire. Specifically, about
religious commitments, we asked current and “raised-in” religious preference. Respondents were also asked how
strong their commitment to their current religious preference was and how

16 Seals et al.

often they attended religious services.
Later in the questionnaire respondents
were asked how much their religion influenced their ideas about abortion.
Three sets of questions were included
and sought information on attitudes and
beliefs about birth control, abortion,
and family planning. The first set of
questions asked respondents if they approved of contraceptives being used under four circumstances: (1) as a means of
limiting family size; (2) as a means of
spacing the birth of children; (3) as a
means of avoiding the birth of children
with birth defects; and (4) as a means of
avoiding having children all together.
Responses were coded on a five-point
Likert scale ranging from “strongly disapprove” to “strongly approve.” These
four questions were repeated substituting abortion for contraceptives. These
eight questions were obliquely factor
analyzed using varimax rotation and factor selection of Eigen values greater
than or equal to 1.5. This method revealed two summary scales differentiating attitudes toward contraceptive use
from attitudes toward abortion. These
responses were measures of the respondents’ own attitudes to abortion and
family planning and hence are the most
subjective measures of these concepts.
The second set of questions had six
items, four of which have been standardized and used extensively in studies
of beliefs about abortion (Sell et al.,
1978; Arney et al., 1976; Henshaw et
al., 1983; Henshaw et al., 1982a; and
Grandberg et al., 1980). The women
were asked if they felt it should be possible for a pregnant woman to obtain a legal abortion under the following circumstances: (1) if there was a chance of
serious defect in the baby; (2) if the
woman’s health was seriously endan

gered by the pregnancy; (3) if the
woman was married but did not want
any more children; (4) if the family had a
low income and could not afford any
more children; (5) if the couple did not
want to have another child at this time;
and (6) if the couple did not want a child
of the sex that was diagnosed before
birth. Responses were categorized as
“yes” or “‘no.”? The percentage of
women agreeing with each question is
presented in Table 1 and is compared to
responses from previous national surveys.

The table shows that for women accepting amniocentesis, agreement with
national parameters was the same for
two questions (3 and 4) and higher for
two questions (1 and 2). For those refusing the procedure, agreement was equal
or lower to that of national parameters
on all but Question 2. On this question,
about whether the respondent will approve of abortion if a woman’s health
was endangered by the pregnancy, the
percentages of women accepting or rejecting amniocentesis agreeing were
much higher than the historical national
sample. These differences may be due
to the fact that our study sample consisted of currently pregnant older
women who were at a relatively higher
risk for having a child with birth defects.
Unfortunately, neither the age distribution nor the pregnancy status or the national sample was available for compari
. son. However, older women have been

shown to be more likely than younger
women to approve abortion when maternal health was endangered (Arney et
al., 1976).

These questions were factor analyzed
and split into two groups reflecting
“hard” and “soft” attitudes toward
abortion (Grandberg, 1980; Smetana,

1979; Smetana et al., 1980). A close inspection at the “‘hard’’ reasons (Questions 1 and 2 reveals that these were
medically oriented. ‘‘Soft’’ reasons
(Questions 3 through 6), on the other
hand, indicate approval of abortion for
nonmedical or personal-social reasons.
Although these attitude scales are usually summed together to form a Guttman scale (Arney et al., 1976); Sell et
al., 1978), and indeed our scales had a
Guttman reproducibility coefficient of
0.96, we wanted to preserve this distinction between sanctioning abortion for
medical versus for personal-social reasons. We therefore retained the two factor analytic scales in all subsequent analysis. These scales were measures of the
women’s intermediate attitudes toward
abortion in that they reflected the condi
tions under which the women would
permit legal abortion.

The last set of questions about abortion asked the women to indicate the
conditions under which they thought
abortion was permitted by current laws
irrespective of whether they agreed or
not with the law. Specifically, the
women were asked whether they
thought it was possible for a woman to
have a legal abortion if: (1) the woman
was married but did not want any more
children; (2) the woman’s health was seriously endangered by the pregnancy;
(3) the family had a low income and
could not afford any more children; (4)
the woman became pregnant as a result
of rape; and (5) there was a chance of serious defects in the baby. Response categories were: not at all possible, only in

the first trimester, in the first and second
trimester, and at any time during pregnancy. Women who said they did not
know the law were encouraged to guess.
Initially, these questions were coded as
a correct versus incorrect response
based on the recent U.S. Supreme
Court decisions and current State of
Iowa laws. However, this measure
poorly correlated with other variables
and did not seem to be particularly
meaningful. We then subjected these responses to factor analysis preserving the
original coding with the claim that this
better reflected the women’s understanding of abortion laws. These questions factored into two categories again
representing medical (Questions 2, 4, 5)
and personal-social (Questions 1 and 3)
reasons for the abortion. Therefore, in
all subsequent analysis the two scales
reflecting the women’s view of whether
the law permitted abortion for medical
Or personal reasons were used for analysis. These concepts reflect the women’s
views of what they thought the laws
about abortion actually permitted and
hence was the most objective measure
of their views.

Two other measures of more general
attitudes were included in the survey.
These two questions have been used in
standarized surveys by the National
Opinion Research Center (NORC).
The first question asks, “How strongly
do you agree with the statement ‘Life
should be preserved under all circumstances all the time?’ ” This is coded on
a five-point Likert scale from “‘strongly
disagree to strongly agree.” This measure has been shown to correlate well
with other measures of morality and yet
it remains independent from specific
types of morality. We use it here as a
measure of general morality. The sec
 

 

Social Biology

ond questions asks, ‘Do you think birth
control information should be available
to anyone who wants it?” and is coded
as “‘yes” or “no.” Again, this question
has been shown to be one of the best independent predictors of family planning
behaviors but is not subsumed under
specific types of attitudes towards family
planning. These questions were analyzed individually.

Finally, we sought measures of
liberalism/conservatism that were not
directly linked to attitudes toward abortion, family planning, or general morality. This was measured in two ways.
First, we asked political party affiliation
and coded it Republican=3, Independent=2, and Democrat=1. We anticipated that Republicans would be more
conservative (e.g., oppose abortion)
than Independents or Democrats. Another measure used was support for the
Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). Support was coded as 1 and Opposition as 0.
Acceptors of amniocentesis were coded
as 1 and rejectors were coded as 0. A
positive relationship, then, can be interpreted as more applicable to acceptors, a
negative relationship to rejectors.

RESULTS
BACKGROUND VARIABLES

There were no differences between
women who accepted or rejected amniocentesis in whether or not they had a
previous child with Down’s syndrome or
neural tube defects. Similarly, there
were no differences in the ages of
women in the two groups, their history
of elective abortion, or the ages at which
elective abortions had been performed.
About 9 per cent of each group had had
an elective abortion. Both women acDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 32, No. 1-2

cepting and rejecting amniocentesis had
small size families (Mean = 0.79) and 18
per cent of the total had no previous
children.

There were consistent class differences between the groups. Women accepting amniocentesis were better educated (r=0.144, p=0.023), had higher
incomes (r=0.170, p=0.005), were
more likely to have the amniocentesis
covered by insurance (r=0.363,
p=0.000), and were more likely to be
Republican (r=0.212, p=0.002) than
women not accepting the procedure.
They were also more likely to be currently married (r=0.174, p =0.006) and
this, in part, accounted for much of the
difference in income between the
groups. In both groups about one-third
of the women were currently employed
(r=0.043, p =0.531) and the employed
women in both groups were equally
committed to their jobs (r=0.011,
p=0.829).

RELIGIOUS INFLUENCES

Though 33 different religious denominations were represented in the sample,
over half were clustered in 3 denominations, Lutheran (25 per cent), Catholic
(18 per cent), and Methodist (15 per
cent). All other denominations were
represented by less than 6 per cent of the
sample. Catholics were slightly overrepresented in the refusing group (r= —
0.158, p =0.012) with the other religions
denominations being fairly equally distributed between the two groups.

In an effort to categorize current religious preference in a meaningful way,
we decided to follow the advice of Marcum (1981) to choose a central doctrinal
difference. Because a main complaint
against amniocentesis 1s the prospect of
selective abortion, we sought to catego
 

Amniocentesis Decision 19

rize religions along the line of their approval or disapproval of legalized abortion. Luker (1984) gives a list of many
denominations and religions that have
formally supported or opposed legalized
abortion. Specifically, Catholics and Lutherans have generally opposed legalized abortion and Methodists, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, and the United
Church of Christ have supported such
legislation. Most of the remaining
groups were small and little information
was available on which to categorize
them. Therefore, we categorized the remaining respondents into three groups
(small Christian denominations, nonChristian denominations, and no religious preference) and cross-tabulated
the groups on all of the questions about
abortion. Within each of these categories or sets, responses were homogeneous and clustered in the following manner (from those most opposing abortion
to those most approving): (1) small
Christian denominations: (2) religions
formally opposing abortion; (3) religions formally approving of abortion;
(4) non-Christian denominations; and
(5) no religious preference. The smallest
differences were between Catholics and
all Protestant denominations and those
were not significant.

As a behavioral check on this categorization, we estimated the percentage of
women in each group who had a previous elective abortion. Behavior highly
followed our categorizations. None of
the women in the small Christian denominations had experienced an abortion, but 7 per cent in the opposing
group, 14 per cent in the approving
group, 20 per cent in the non-Christian
group, and 23 per cent of those in the
group with no religious preference had
previous abortions. For subsequent

20 Seals et al.

analysis, we collapsed Groups 1 and 2
(disapprove) and Groups 3, 4, and 5
(approve) and refer to this variable as
religious approval of legalized abortion.

Both women accepting and rejecting
amniocentesis had an average church attendance of about once a month. However, in both groups about half of the
sample were regular attenders (once a
week) and the other half were low attenders (once or twice a year or less).
About 40 per cent of each group had
changed their religious preference to
one that was different from the church in
which they were raised. This is about
twice as high as expected (Mueller,
1980). Of those who changed religious
groups, half changed to no preference, a
fourth to Catholic, and the remaining
fourth to Protestant. All of the original
Catholics changed to no preference.
Protestants changed to Catholic (25 per
cent), to other Protestant groups (25 per
cent), or to no preference (50 per cent).
Protestants who changed to another
Protestant denomination generally
moved from a denomination opposing
legalized abortion to one approving.
Therefore, for both original Catholics
and Protestants a change in religious
group indicated a move to a more liberal
philosophy concerning abortion.

There were no differences between
women accepting or rejecting amniocentesis on how strongly they were committed to their religion (r= —0.098,
p=0.140). However, there was a slight
tendency for those belonging to religious groups that opposed abortion to
have a stronger commitment (r=—
0.127, p=0.056). This relationship is
slightly stronger when the non-Christian
group is excluded from the calculation.
The non-Christians, mostly belonging to
Middle and Far-Eastern religions, were

 

Social Biology

highly committed to their religions.
Along these same lines, more of the
women refusing amniocentesis stated
that their religious teachings on abortion had influenced their feelings about
abortion (r= —0.248, p=0.000). All
five measures of religiosity correlated
highly with each other.

MORALITY AND ATTITUDES TOWARD
FAMILY PLANNING

The respondents’ beliefs in the sanctity of life highly correlated with the decision to reject amniocentesis (r= —
0.328, p=0.000). This bivariate
correlation was the strongest among the
attitudinal variables. The respondents
view that birth control should be generally available was not significantly correlated with whether they accepted or
rejected amniocentesis (r=0.012,
p=0.844). Another general measure,
whether or not the respondent approved of the Equal Rights Amendment, was weakly related to accepting
amniocentesis (r=0.143, p=0.063).
These variables were not significantly
correlated with each other.

All the scales measuring attitude to
family planning were significantly correlated to acceptance of amniocentesis.
The respondents’ attitudes towards contraceptives (r=0.257, p =0.000) and attitudes towards abortion (7=0.264,
p=0.000) were moderate predictors.
The scale measuring whether or not the
woman sanctioned abortion for medical
reasons was a moderate predictor
(r=0.260, p =0.000), but the scale measuring sanctioning of abortion for
personal-social reasons was only a weak
predictor (=0.152, p=0.030).

The last scales, those reflecting the
respondents’ views on laws permitting
abortion, were similar to the scales meaDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

 

 

Vol. 32, No. 1-2

suring the woman’s sanctioning of abortion. When abortion was for medical
reasons, the relationship was moderate
(r=0.295, p=0.000), but when it was
for personal-social reasons the relationship was weak (r=0.142, p=0.0520).
Apparently, acceptors and rejectors
were conservative in their ideas about
whether the laws permitted abortion or
not. Nonetheless, women who refused
amniocentesis were pessimistic about
whether the law made abortion available or not and fully 10 per cent of them
thought abortion was not at all legally
available under all of the circumstances.
No women accepting amniocentesis
thought the latter was true. Both groups
of women though abortion was generally not available in the second and third
trimesters of pregnancy, except for a
few women accepting amniocentesis
who thought it was available only for
medical reasons. All six scales measuring attitudes toward family planning
were significantly correlated with each
other.

MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS

All variables reflecting background
factors and religious and moral influences were simultaneously entered
into the regression equation. Because it
is important to note significant as well as
nonsignificant results, we present the
full model. The standardized Beta’s,
however, are not completely accurate
indicators of the strength of effect of a
given variable on the dependent variable because of the degree of interrelationship or collinearity among independent variables.

Only seven variables are significant
net predictors of acceptance of amniocentesis (Table 2). The strongest net
predictor was subjects’ estimate of the

Amniocentesis Decision 21

difficulty they had in deciding to accept
or to reject amniocentesis. This predictor, however, is the focus of another paper and will not be further discussed
here. The next four most significant net
predictors were fairly comparable in size
and were moderate in strength. They
were the respondents’ views of laws permitting abortion for medical reasons, affiliation with the Republican party, belief in the sanctity of life, and
amniocentesis covered by insurance.
The last two significant net predictors
were whether or not they had changed
religion and their views of laws permitting abortion for personal-social reasons. The R? for this total model was
moderately strong R?= 0.403).

Due to the degree of interrelationship between the abortion scales, we decided to exclude the scales measuring respondents’ views of laws permitting
abortion. This done, the intermediate
set of abortion questions measuring
whether or not the respondents’ sanctioned legal abortion became net predictors. Sanctioning legal abortion for
medical reasons was a moderate predictor, and sanctioning legal abortion for
personal reasons a weak predictor. The
respondents’ attitudes toward contraceptives and abortion remained nonsignificant predictors. Subsequently we
excluded the scales measuring objective
and intermediate attitudes toward abortion. Only with these four measures excluded did the respondents’ own attitudes toward abortion become net
predictors. We repeatedly tested this
hierarchial ordering and found this to be
a consistent pattern with the least objective measure being the weakest and the
most objective measure being the
strongest predictor. In later analysis we
focused on the strongest predictor which

was the respondents’ views of laws permitting abortion for medical and for personal reasons.

We further studied factors predicting
the respondents’ views of laws permitting abortion for medical reasons (Table
3) and for personal-social reasons (Table 4). The predictors of the respondents’ views about laws permitting abortion for medical reasons were their
educational level and the frequency of
their religious attendance. Whether or
not the respondent currently belonged

to a religious group which supports legal
abortion did not significantly relate to
her views about laws permitting abortion for medical reasons.

Similarly, the only significant predictor of the respondent’s view of laws permitting abortion for personal-social reasons was the woman’s education. The
more educated the woman the more liberal she thought these laws were. There

laws as prohibitory, but these relationships were not significant (Table 4).
Women who attended church regularly
were less educated, had no previous history of abortion, had no insurance coverage, and were more likely to believe
strongly in the sanctity of life (Table 5).

To summarize these results in a more
concise and meaningful manner, we

have presented a reduced regression
model. Here, only significant predictors
are included in the analysis. Causal ordering is assumed; hence, background
factors are placed as exogeneous variables, attitudes are intermediate endogeneous predictors, and the decision to accept or reject amniocentesis is the main
dependent variable (Figure 1). Because

of the assumed casual equality of the intermediate attitudinal variables, no attempt has been made to present a full
path diagram. Instead, the information
presented here is for heuristic purposes.
Note that in the reduced model the respondents’ view of laws permitting abortion for personal-social reasons has been
excluded. This is not surprising as this
scale was the weakest net predictor in
the original full model. The R? for this
model is moderate (R* = 0.292).

In this model, belief in the sanctity of
life is the strongest net predictor of the
acceptance of amniocentesis. Insurance
coverage is about comparable in
strength. The other attitude variable,
view of abortion for medical reasons, is
about equal to the influence of political
persuasion. And the last net significant
predictor is the respondent’s change of
religious denomination.

DISCUSSION

Prenatal diagnosis of genetic disease
is widely practiced is most developed
countries. Amniocentesis is a procedure
used prenatally to obtain amniotic fluid,

eee ee ween eweos

0.19 0.06 0.31

fetal blood, or fetal cell samples for
studies of the well-being and functions
of the fetus. Though the procedure has
been available to medical practitioners,
its full impact on reproductive behaviors
and decisions has not been well documented. For instance, although the legal
availability of abortion itself is reported
to decrease the incidence of the birth of
the infants with Down’s syndrome in the
community (Smith et al., 1980), how
much of the reduction is directly attributable to the use of amniocentesis is still
unclear. This is because a small percentage of women at risk for Down’s syndrome have the procedure (LippmanHand and Piper, 1981; Polani et al.,
1979). Further, even if all older women
were screened, Cruikshank et al.,
(1983) have estimated that this would at
most reduce the percentage of Down’s
syndrome births by 5-10 per cent.

The impact of amniocentesis on
women who have the procedure is even
less clear. Amniocentesis is still closely
linked with abortion (Verp and Gerbie,
1981; Davies and Doran, 1982) despite
the fact that only a relatively small number of women having the procedure

have abnormal results (Cruikshank et
al., 1983). This close linkage is probably
due to the fact that in the United States
abortion is seen as a deviant behavior
even by those who have had it (Rosen
and Martindale, 1978). Also, it is alleged that one’s religious beliefs or morality strongly influence one’s views on
abortion (Rosen et al., 1979; Rosen and
Martindale, 1978). However, the exact

influence of religious beliefs and morality on the decision to accept or reject
amniocentesis still remains speculative.

Much of the statement in research on
objections to amniocentesis is due to a
lack of precision in measuring religious
and moral influences on parental
decision-making. This has unfortunately led to these concepts being
treated as the same and often being

measured by only one variable. In this
paper we attempted to resolve this ambiguity by using five measures of religiosity, seven measures of attitudes toward abortion and family planning, two
measures of conservatism, and one
measure of general morality.

We found consistent background differences between those accepting and
rejecting amniocentesis and this persisted in multivariate analysis. Previous
studies of amniocentesis have also documented this socioeconomic difference
(Robinson et al., 1975; Davies and
Doran, 1982; Antley, 1976). Hence, insurance coverage was the strongest bivariate predictor of acceptance of amniocentesis. Indeed, when the cost of
amniocentesis is high, it is an important
matter. However, in the open-ended
question querying why the women accepted or rejected amniocentesis, only
two women openly acknowledged economic reasons as important to their decision. And, while economic limitations
are noteworthy, they do not completely
determine this decision. Insurance coverage is only one of five significant net
predictors, and it is second in strength.
Also, insurance coverage represents
more than just one issue. Its high interrelatedness with other indicators of socioeconomic differences (income, education, etc.) makes it representative of
more general soctoeconomic differences
between the two groups of women. It
may be asked, however, why insurance
coverage was the best indicator of socioeconomic status when education and income, respectively, have held this position. Our question did not just ask
whether or not the respondent had insurance, but whether they had insurance
that would cover the amniocentesis pro

cedure. This more Sensitive measure accounts for its prominence as a net predictor of acceptance or rejection of
amniocentesis.

A more surprising background predictor of amniocentesis is that of political party affiliation. In studies of attitudes toward abortion (Henshaw and
Martire, 1982a; Grandberg and Grandberg, 1980), Democrats generally have
been found to have more permissive attitudes toward abortion than do Republicans. Not surprisingly, Democrats are
slightly overrepresented among women
who have abortions (Henshaw and Martire, 1982b). Here, little can be said to
explain the preponderance of affiliation
with Republicans as a significant predictor of acceptance of amniocentesis. Socioeconomic differences between party
groups is not helpful as an explanation
because this relationship holds independent of any measure of socioeconomics,
Also, controlling for the women who labelled themselves politically as Independents in our sample did not alter this
finding. The other measure of conservatism, the support of the ERA, was nota
predictor of any of the dependent variables, a finding consistent with a previous
report by Grandberg and Grandberg
(1980).

The only measure of religiosity that
was a net direct predictor of the amniocentesis decision was a change of religious group. On a bivariate level, a
change of religious group was not significantly related to acceptance of amniocentesis (r= —0.084, p=0.16). The
zero-order correlations of change of religious group with other measures of religiosity are consistent with the interpretation that such a change signals a more
liberal attitude toward abortion (less re

ligious attendance, less commitment to
religion, and less influence of religion on
attitudes toward abortion). However, in
multivariate analysis this measure of religiosity predicted rejection of amniocentesis. It is unclear why women who
changed their religion were more likely
to reject amniocentesis than those who
did not. We did not ask why women
changed their religion, although response to this question would be essential to explaining this perplexing relationship.

The attitudinal variables were the
first and third best predictors of acceptance of amniocentesis. As would be expected, a stronger belief in the sanctity
of life, our measure of general morality,
was the strongest predictor of rejection
of amniocentesis. A liberal view of laws
permitting abortion for medical reasons
was also strongly related to acceptance
of amniocentesis.

An investigation of influences on
these attitudinal variables revealed that
religious attendance mitigated against
liberal views toward abortion laws and
encouraged a belief in the sanctity of
life, and this was consistent with findings
from past research (Sell et al., 1978;
Smetana and Adler, 1980; Shain, 1982;
Henshaw and Martire, 1982a@ and b;
Grandberg and Grandberg, 1980).
Given its importance though, we expected this variable to have a more direct influence on the decision about amniocentesis. The sum of both indirect
paths (Beta = —0.092) was nine times as
large as the net relationship reported in
Table 2 and was about as large as the
zero-order relationship between church
attendance and amniocentesis (r= —
0.103, p=0.106). We concluded that religious attendance, then, is important

variables.

The respondent’s membership in a
denomination that supports legalization
of abortion related inversely to her
views supporting laws sanctioning abortion for medical reasons. On the bivariate level, this relationship was positive
and nonsignificant (r=0.007,
p=0.926). This variable was also positively related to the other dependent
variable measuring views of laws permitting abortion for personal reasons
(see Table 4). This relationship may be
spurious, because when one controls for
education and religious attendance only
very minor differences were found in the
women’s attitudes toward abortion
among groups that approve compared
to groups that disapprove of availability
of legal abortion.

However, previous studies have not
found religion to be a consistent predictor of attitudes toward abortion (Henshaw and Martire, 1982a) or amniocentesis decisions (Davies and Doran, 1982;
Lippman-Hand and Piper, 1981). Fully
half of those who contended abortion
was wrong still thought it should be legal, and especially so for medical reasons (Henshaw and Martire, 1982a).
Rosen et al. (1979) found that attitudes
toward abortion changed when women
face an actual pregnancy as opposed to
when they speculate about a possible
one. We suggest that, were the women
in our study not currently pregnant and
were they not potentially facing the possibility of having a selective abortion,
this relationship would be in the expected direction. |

Higher educated women viewed laws
permitting abortion when medically indicated more liberally and were less

28 Seals et al.

likely to think life should be preserved at
all costs. These findings are consistent
with findings from previous studies (Arney and Trescher, 1976); Grandberg
and Grandberg, 1980).

Having had an elective abortion does
mitigate against a strong belief in the
sanctity of life, and this is as expected
(Henshaw and Martire, 1982a). However, it is somewhat surprising that this
variable does not have a more profound
influence and that it is not related to
other attitudes toward abortion. Grandberg and Grandberg (1980), whose find
‘ings were similar to ours, concluded that

this must relfect a lag between being acceptable as behavior and being an acceptable attitude.

In conclusion, we find that certain
measures of morality and attitudes toward abortion are major influences on
the decision of whether or not to have
amniocentesis. Background factors,
such as insurance coverage, education,
and political persuasion, play an equally
important part. Except for religious attendance, whose influence is small and
indirect, we find little influence of religion itself and the direction of that influence was consistent with what would
be expected.

 

Social Biology

Although attitudes about abortion
and morality about life and death issues
are influenced by religion, it appears
that religious factors only indirectly influence the decision to accept or reject
amniocentesis. Women at risk of having
an affected child due to their age at pregnancy appear to make rational decisions
about prenatal amniocentesis for diagnosis of Down’s syndrome based on
their belief and attitudes, but also on
more practical matters such as their ability to pay for the procedure. Since education plays an important role in forming attitudes and morality, this also
suggests that education targeted to a
particular disease and improvement of
general level of education may influence
attitudes towards prenatal diagnosis.
These factors should be kept in mind in
designing and implementing genetic
counseling programs.
