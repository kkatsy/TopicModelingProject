Ever since oral steroids came into wide
use as contraceptive agents during the
1960’s, concern has been voiced occasionally that these compounds might increase
the frequency of cancer, particularly of the
reproductive organs. Efforts to resolve the
issue by experimental work with animals
fail to resolve the issue conclusively, mainly
because of difficulties in extrapolating findings. Although the human cervix probably
provides the most common site for female
cancers on a world-wide basis, the disease
appears to be species-specific. This problem
confounds the plausibility of extrapolation
from other species.

The incidence of neoplasms of the cervix
varies more by social groups than does any
other primary cancer. For example, differentials in rates of cervical neoplasia among
ethnic groups within the United States are
of greater magnitude than are those differences to which we are accustomed in most
sociological research (e.g., suicide and homicide). Perhaps the most remarkable data
on this point comes from a study by

Haenszel and Hillhouse (1969) which compared age-adjusted incidence rates of cervical cancer among Jews, non-Jewish
Whites, Blacks, and Puerto Ricans (the
respective order of risk). In their study,
Puerto Ricans had a 25 times higher risk
of cervical cancer than did Jews; Blacks
were at four times the risk of non-Jewish
Caucasians.

In detailed retrospective studies, at least
two variables have emerged as consistently
related to differences in relative risks of
cervical cancer: age at first coitus and number of coital partners (e.g., Martin, 1966
and 1967; Moghissi et al., 1968). Both
variables show different distributions among
cancer and noncancer patients.

Use of the pill (rather than other methods) is known to vary with socioeconomic
status, ethnicity, age, and parity (Ryder
and Westoff, 1966; Dubrow et al., 1969).
Women who are undecided about a method
of use are most often prescribed pills, and
physicians frequently use nonmedical criteria in prescribing contraceptives (Drobyn

255

256 Merritt et al.

et al., 1971; Orr and Terry, 1971). Women
of upper socioeconomic levels have been
prescribed pills far more often than other
women (Measham et al., 1971).

The National Fertility Study and the
Princeton Fertility Study found that the
coital frequency of both pill and IUD users
exceeded that of other contraceptors even
when age, race, education, and religion were
controlled (Westoff et al., 1969; Westoff
et al., 1971). Almost no data are available
which compare contraceptors in terms of
their age at first coitus, the focus of our
data in this paper.

The pill is more popular with young
women than with older. Increasing evidence
shows that sexual intercourse occurs today
at younger ages than was true in the past
(Luckey and Nass, 1972; Lundy, 1972;
Zelnick and Kantner, 1972). There may or
may not be a connection between the widespread dissemination of oral contraception
and the progressively lower ages at first
coitus. Data from our study (not shown
here) indicate a clear age gradient in reported age at first intercourse; the younger
women report earlier experience. If oral
contraception affects population trends of
age at first intercourse and number of coital
partners, we might see, over time, a higher
rate of cervical neoplasia among pill users
due simply to the pill’s effects on sexual
behavior (Merritt, Balin, et al., 1972).

Thus, any analysis of the association between contraception and cervical neoplasia
must take into account nonpharmacologic
or social and sexual differences between
users of the various methods. In particular,
do women who request the use of oral contraception differ noticeably in their age at
first coitus from those who choose intrauterine devices, or other methods, or who
are undecided? In the remaining portion of
this paper we introduce some evidence concerning these questions and evaluate several
a posteriori hypotheses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The Institute for Survey Research (ISR)
at Temple University in Philadelphia has
completed the initial interviews and recording of gynecologic examination results for
25,000 American women. The women attend large clinic and group health centers
located in nine continental cities and in
three cities in Puerto Rico (Merritt, Edington, et al., 1972). At the time this paper
was prepared, almost 12,000 patients had
been fully enrolled with data completed
concerning their contraceptive, sexual, and
reproductive history. These data were obtained by a standardized interview coupled
with a brief medical history, a pelvic and
breast examination, medical chart reviews,
and two cytologic specimens. The entire
protocol was bilingual. Age at first coitus
was measured by the patient’s report of an
estimated month (or season) and year. This
question was answered after the complete
contraceptive and pregnancy histories were
obtained, a method that was adopted after
thoroughly pretesting several alternatives
for reliability. Actual age at first intercourse
was then calculated as the number of
elapsed months from month and year of
birth to estimated month and year of initial experience.

In order to investigate the relationship
between reported age at first coitus (AFC)
and years of education, current age, number of previous pregnancies (gravida),
choice of contraceptive method (contraceptive pill, IUD, other, and undecided),
and ethnicity (North American White,
NAW; North American Black, NAB;
Puerto Rican, PR; and Mexican American,
MA), the analysis of covariance was employed.

RESULTS

As can be seen from analysis of variance
results provided in Table 1, years of education and current age each have a significant

effect (p < 0.001) on age at first coitus;
their respective regression coefficients are
8.662 and 0.307, indicating a positive relationship. Gravida also is significantly related ($< 0.001) to AFC; its regression
coefficient of —8.422 suggests a negative
relationship.

Table 2 shows the mean AFC scores adjusted for educational level, current age,
and total number of pregnancies by the
ordinary least squares method, while Table
3 gives the mean scores prior to adjustment, Contrasting Tables 2 and 3 reveals
the impact of the regression adjustment in
each of the subpopulations. It may be noted
that adjustments ranged from seventy-eight
weeks downward (North American White,
Other) to fifty-two weeks upward (Mexican American, IUD). Despite this consid
erable range, it is clear that interpretations
of relative differences in the coital ages of
the subpopulations is largely unaffected by
adjustment, although as mentioned above
each of the covariates was found to be
highly significant. The latter finding is not
surprising, given a sample size of almost
12,000.

We observe in Table 1 that the mean
AFC of 18.6 years for North American
Whites (shown in Table 2) differed significantly (p < 0.001) from the mean AFC of
17.5 years for North American Blacks; the
mean AFC of 19.8 for Puerto Ricans differed significantly (<< 0.001) from the
mean AFC of 20.2 for Mexican Americans.

The mean AFC of 18.8 years for oral
contraceptive choosers differed significantly
(p < 0.025), but probably unimportantly,

from the 18.7 years for IUD choosers. Users
of the pill, IUD, and other choosers have
been grouped together as those women who
were initially decided as to a contraceptive
method; the mean AFC for this “decided”
group differed significantly (p< 0.01)
from the mean AFC of 19.2 years for
women who were initially undecided on a
contraceptive method.

Inspection of the rank order of ethnic
groups by AFC within each category of
chosen contraception is identical to the marginal order. North American Blacks showed
the earliest reported AFC regardless of
method selected. However, the marginal
distribution of AFC by method does not
provide as good a prediction of relative
differences between methods within ethnic
groups.

The interaction effect between choice of
contraception and ethnicity was highly significant (Pp < 0.001), as can be seen in
Table 1. Although we have not subjected
the data to detailed orthogonal contrasts
for the specific sources of interaction, we
can point to some obvious comparisons.
The difference between the mean AFC’s
for NAB and NAW appear to be greater
for the undecided group than for the decided group. Also, Mexican Americans who
choose the pill reported a lower AFC than

did those who choose an IUD; the other
ethnic groups showed an opposite pattern.

DISCUSSION

In 1970, Stern and associates reported
that within a group of family planning patients who had not previously used the pill
(other methods may have been used), those
who chose the pill had a higher prevalence
of cytologic dysplasia at the time of choice
than women who chose the intrauterine
device, though both groups were apparently
similar in demographic characteristics
(Stern et al., 1970; also, Stern et al., 1971).
Earlier, in 1969, Melamed and associates
had presented New York family planning
data from which it could be shown that
among women just beginning the use of
steroids as compared to those beginning
use of diaphragms, the former were at
greater risk of severe dysplasia and more
advanced forms of abnormal cervical cytology (Melamed, 1969). These findings
occasioned considerable surprise in the
medical community. They suggested that
women who selected the pill differed in
sexual history from those who selected
other methods. However, findings of cytologic atypias at a large Philadelphia clinic
failed to support this conclusion (Shulman
and Merritt, 1973). Findings of the pres

ent study for the first time permit direct
assessment of coital ages, but also fail to
indicate notable differences in this parameter of sexual history.

The differences in AFC between ethnic
groups and between certain contraceptivechoice groups has been shown to be statistically significant. It is readily apparent,
however, that almost any differences would
have proven to be significant with a sample
size of 12,000. One question, then, is
whether the small actual differences, e.g.,
about five weeks overall between the pill
and IUD choosers, are substantively interesting. We feel that the differences reported
here (ignoring ethnic effects) are not likely
to be important on biological grounds.
Given normal maturation changes in the
cervix, the differences would be more
notable if they occurred around a mean age
of fifteen years rather than around these
means of approximately nineteen years. The
cervix, and especially the squamo-columnar
junction where nearly all the lesions arise,
has ordinarily completed its change in position well before the age of nineteen.

However, it may not be so easy to ignore
the interaction between ethnicity and
method selection. For example, the reported
average AFC for Blacks, Whites, and
Puerto Ricans was 10-16 weeks higher for
the pill choosers than for those requesting
the IUD. Mexican Americans have a reverse pattern; the average AFC for the
IUD choosers was 10 weeks higher than
that for the pill group. The question here
is whether a positive or negative difference
of 10 to 16 weeks is biologically notable at
mean ages of seventeen to twenty years at

initial experience. That is, this 10-16 week
difference would clearly be of no significance if the mean age at first coitus took
place, say, in the mid twenties, On the other
hand, if the population mean were closer
to the average age at menarche (about age
13), it clearly would be biologically significant. We cannot venture a firm conclusion.
Among other problems, we do not know
whether there are significant differences
among racial or ethnic groups in the rate
of maturation of the reproductive organs
(e.g., onset of menarche).

The few studies known to us that purport to show an unfavorable gradient of
risks of cervical cancer among oral contraceptors have utilized largely Black populations. If our findings regarding AFC, ethnicity, and method requested are generalizable to the larger population, and to earlier
points in time (or cohorts), then there may
be some problem in explaining why the
small but significant differences should
favor the oral users, i.e., be consistent with
a slightly lower risk gradient.

Our findings contribute yet more evidence that the epidemiological problems in
surveillance of oral contraceptives are exceedingly complex. Population surveillance
data provide no evidence to suggest that
widespread use of the oral contraceptors
in the mid-to-late 1960’s has been followed
by increasing rates of carcinoma im sifu in
later years (Merritt and Shulman, 1975).
Most epidemiological research has failed to
reveal significant restrospective associations
between oral contraceptive use and abnormal cervical cytology, and the present
results are consistent with this pattern.
