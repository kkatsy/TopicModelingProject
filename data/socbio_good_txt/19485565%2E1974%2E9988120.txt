Mortality Patterns in Cuanalan, Mexico:

1866~—1970

Mortality trends are important demographic parameters because they provide
direct evidence for the analysis of transitions in population size, structure, and
composition. Patterns of mortality may
also serve as useful indicators of the action of various biological processes in a
population. The infant death rate in a
particular community, for example, might
furnish clues as to the efficacy of different
disease producing agencies, the effects of
such environmental conditions as altitude
or climate upon adaptation and survival,
or some of the outcomes of changes in the
nutritional status of the population. The
level of prereproductive mortality in a population is closely related to the potential
operation of natural selection (Crow, 1958,
1962).

Often, statistical data on human mortality are obtained from demographic surveys
of large and heterogenous populations, such
as states or entire nations. While many
valuable insights have been gained through
this approach, the construction of mortality profiles for specific communities can
help to elucidate numerous additional
facets of human death. The study of mortality in individual populations within the
context of their unique demographic and
environmental circumstances is advisable

 

for two purposes: (1) to enhance the understanding of the diverse biological and
ecological factors influencing mortality;
and (2) to increase awareness of the extensive variability across human populations with respect to patterns of survival
and death.

As part of a wider investigation of the
genetic, demographic, and evolutionary
consequences of population transplantation
(Halberstein, 1973, 1974; Halberstein and
Crawford, 1974), the present research
focuses upon mortality in a migrant population in Central Mexico. Through the
analysis of historical vital statistics records, questionnaire data, and census materials from Cuanalan in the state of
Mexico, an attempt is made to interpret
the observed trends in age at death, infant
and childhood mortality, survivorship,
and cause of death over the past century
in terms of a number of ecological and
cultural variables affecting the community.
The evolutionary implications of the findings are discussed, especially with regard
to the potential action of natural selection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The state of Mexico, located in the Valley of Mexico, is subdivided into 120 administrative sections known as municipios

(townships). One municipio, Acolman, occupies 86.29 square kilometers in the eastern portion of the state. In addition to the
executive center (cabecera), Acolman consists of 16 barrios (territorial subunits).
The population studied here is Cuanalan,
a barrio of 2,040 inhabitants. Figure 1
situates the state of Mexico in relation to
bordering states, the Federal District (the
metropolitan area of Mexico City), and
the rest of the country. Figure 2 locates
Acolman and Cuanalan within the state
of Mexico.

(Halberstein et al., 1973). Spaniards and
Tlaxcalans collaborated to form a military
alliance against the Aztecs of Central Mexico, and the state of Tlaxcala became a
major link in the geographic network traveled by Spanish soldiers connecting the
east coast of Mexico and the Aztec capital
of Tenotchtitlan (Bernal Diaz [1568]
1927, p. 269; White, 1971, p. 187; Isxlilxochitl, 1969, p. 138).

Informants in Cuanalan reported that
the original migrants were Tlaxcalan political prisoners transported by Spaniards

The earliest residents of Cuanalan were
migrants from the adjoining state of Tlaxcala who were relocated for political and
military reasons by Spanish authorities
during the early colonial period in the
New World. Spanish contact with Tlaxcala

date of the migration is uncertain, but two
possible times are suggested in the literature on the colonization of Tlaxcala. Some
16,000 Tlaxcalan warriors were mobilized
and sent into the Valley of Mexico in
1519 and 1520 (Prescott [1843] 1901,
Vol. II, pp. 66 and 393; White, 1971, p.
241). According to Gibson (1967, p. 185),
Spanish administrators supervised the
transplantation of 401 Tlaxcalan families
to four new colonies to the north and to

 

two additional locations west of Tlaxcala
in 1591,

Cuanalan lies in an ecological zone characterized by the finest farmland in the
Valley of Mexico (Sanders, 1965, p. 26),
and agriculture forms the subsistence base
of the community. Nearly three-fourths of
the working adults are actively engaged
in farming pursuits. However, Cuanalan
does not maintain a marketplace, and
residents must journey elsewhere to sell

the commodities not consumed or exchanged privately in the barrio itself. Corn,
beans, poultry, and meat products are the
major salable items. Neither a public
health clinic nor medical service of any
kind is found in Cuanalan; the nearest
facility is located six kilometers away in
the cabecera of Acolman. Since, 1956, a
regular bus service has provided passage
from Cuanalan to various highway statioris
where connections are available for Mexico
City and other large commercial centers,
An analysis of the 1970 government census of Cuanalan revealed that household
composition is quite variable. Ninety-five
of 280 sampled dwellings, or slightly over
one-third, contain extended families. The
mean size of residential units is 6.76 persons. However, 35 households are occupied
by single persons or couples, and 10 households have 15 or more individuals. Several
homes visited during the fieldwork accommodate two to four related nuclear families
in separate dwellings, each with an entrance facing a common courtyard.

A comprehensive biological investigation
of Cuanalan was conducted in 1972. A
team of seven researchers collected the
following data: serological specimens, dermatoglyphics, dental impressions, color
vision tests, anthropometric measurements,
demographic information, and complete
medical examinations.

The demographic information was secured from three sources: (1) the 1970
government census of the barrio; (2) vital
statistics registers located in the municipal
executive office, and (3) a demographic
proforma.

The census provided data on population
size, household size and composition, population structure, and occupations of Cuanalan residents. The municipal records
contain certificates of births, deaths, and
matriages from 1866 through 1970. Microfilmed copies of entries pertinent to Cu

analan were made for each year from
1866 through 1879. For 1880-1970,
photographs were taken of the materials
from even-numbered years. The death records are thorough and complete. Each
warrant lists the name, age (in years and
months), sex, and birthplace of the deceased party; the location and cause of
death; and the exact date and time of
death. After 1930, the death notices were
signed by a licensed physician who presumably was familiar with each case. Prior
to that date, the accounts were rendered
by relatives of the deceased. On many of
the forms after 1930 a space is provided
for the race (“raza”) of the individual,
and “Mestizo” is the response in every
instance. The information was coded and
transferred to computer cards; 1,529 separate death records were transcribed. A
BMDO/7D (Biomedical) program (Dixon,
1971, p. 95) cross-tabulated the data according to type of variable and date of
each record. The same program produced
stratified histograms of the variables by
selected time units.

The 278 demographic interviews administered in the community resulted in information regarding 2,570 consanguineal
relatives from Cuanalan, including deceased persons, immigrants, and emigrants
for whom data was received. The questionnaire afforded an examination of mortality
parameters similar to those explored
through the written documents.

RESULTS

Based upon data collected from the
municipal registry, Table 1 shows the ages
at death for 1,529 males and females in
twenty-year segments from 1866 to 1970.
Mean ages at death were computed for
each time period; adjusted means apply
to only those individuals who had survived
the first year of life.

The increases in both measures have

been linear, and the standard deviation
has likewise undergone an elevation through
time. F values (10.54 for means and 18.22
for adjusted means) indicate that the overall temporal changes are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. In the total
sample there is a difference of almost nine
years between mean and adjusted mean age
at death. The distinction between the two
indicators has become progressively wider
through time, and the separation is about
16.5 years in the latest period (1951-70).

Age at death in the total Cuanalan sample exhibits a strong similarity to the
Mexican Indian population of San Pablo,
Tlaxcala, studied by Halberstein and Crawford (1972), where the overall mean age
at death is 20.22 years and the adjusted
mean is 30.06 years.

Social Biology

Male and female ages at death for the
same samples are compared in Table 2.
Female ages at death are characterized by
steady increases in both mean and adjusted mean age. The upward shifts in
these measures is less regular for males,
but an analysis of variance identified the
trends as statistically significant for both
sexes at the 0.01 level. Male and female
ages at death and standard deviations are
quite similar in the total sample. Standard errors of the mean were scored, and
the sexual differences are not statistically
significant throughout the various time
units, probably because of the large standard deviations. However, in the latest
time period (1951-70), females show a
more pronounced rise in average age at
death.

Assuming that the records are correct,
the absolute number of deaths in Cuanalan
has diminished in recent years. There were
an average of 34.0 deaths per year during
1891-1930, and 24.6 deaths per year during 1931-70.

Ages at death for the total sample are
shown in Table 3. Over 30 per cent of all
deaths between 1866 and 1970 were of infants (under one year of age). More than
half of the deaths were children younger
than five years of age. Proportionally fewer
females succumbed as infants, but they
exhibit a higher percentage of deaths from

diminishes at age five, and deaths are fairly

after which a second attenuation occurs.
Females experienced greater longevity than
males, attaining ages past 80 more than
twice as frequently.

in Cuanalan over the past century is not
typical of the present survivorship rates
in the nation in two respects—childhood
mortality was more severe in Cuanalan,
and survival to older ages (i.e., 60 and
above) occurred less frequently in Cuanalan over the past century than now occurs
in the country as a whole. A comparison of
the modern period (1951-70) in Cuanalan
with Mexico as a whole in 1966 maintains
these differentials, although their magnitude is reduced (see Table 5).

A somewhat different picture is seen in
the death table constructed for 1866-90
(Table 5). Children under age five ac

counted for about 62 per cent of the deaths,
almost 10 per cent more than for all time
periods combined (see Table 3). Deaths
of children aged one through four were
more numerous than infant deaths, and the
former constituted the largest single age
category. It is possible that infant deaths
were not recorded as carefully during this
early period. Proportionally fewer males
than females died before age five. At age
70 and above, males outnumber females
by a wide margin in deaths. Only one per

son of the 356 in the sample for 1866-90
survived beyond age 84.

Table 5 also outlines the death table
for 1951-70, and a number of divergent
features may be noted. A greater percentage of the deaths were of infants in
comparison to the 1866-90 sample. Two
explanations may be offered. First, the
absolute number of infant deaths has actually declined—from 106 in 1866-90 to
82 in 1951-70. The relative frequency of
deaths between ages one and four declines
in 1951-70, giving the decreased number
of infant deaths a more inflated proportion. Thus, the higher percentage is partly
an artifact of the lower sample size in
the later period. On the other hand, it may
be that earlier recorders listed “one year”
for many children who died before the
first birthday. While relatively fewer lives
were lost before age five between 1951
and 1970, the level is still above 48 per
cent. The tapering rate of death beginning
at age five is more marked in the later
sample. Perhaps the most striking aspect
of the most recent death table is the-comparatively larger number of elderly
deaths. In 1866-90, only 4.79 per cent
of the population survived to age 70 and
above, while 15.55 per cent did so in 1951~
70. Unlike the 1866-90 sample, females
outlived males in the recent sample; 21.21
per cent of the females survived to 70
years, while only 8.91 per cent of the males
reached 70.

Survivorship in Cuanalan appears to
conform to general patterns described for
Mexico and Latin America. Arriaga and
Davis (1969) report a directional increase in life expectancy in Latin America
from 1860 to 1960, with the greatest
changes occurring between 1930 and 1960.
Somoza (1965, 1967) states that the
crude death rate has fallen and the average age at death has increased in recent
years in Mexico. A death table for Mexico

Social Biology

in 1966 was prepared from the raw data of
Keyfitz and Flieger (1971, p. 344), and
the results are included in Table 5. The
death table is generally comparable to the
Cuanalan counterpart for 1951-70, but
with some important exceptions. In the
Mexican nation as a whole, a smaller
portion of deaths involved infants and
children under five years of age. Also,
18.03 per cent of the deaths in Mexico
in 1966 were of individuals age 70 or older,
about 2.5 per cent higher than in Cuanalan.
Although nationally females survived to
later ages than males, the sexual distinction is not as sharp as in the Cuanalan
sample.

changes in the percentages of deaths of
Cuanalan residents younger than age 15,
the theoretical threshold of reproductive
capability. There has been a gradual decline in the proportion, and the lowest
frequency occurs in the most recent time
unit (1951-70), with a reduction of almost
17 per cent from the sample of deaths for
1866-90. Nevertheless, nearly 60 per cent
of all sampled deaths since 1866 are children who failed to achieve reproductive
maturity, and this figure is higher than in
ten of the twelve modern Latin American
populations cited by Salzano (1972).
The proportion of deaths occurring in

the first year of life has shown less systematic fluctuations through time than
total prereproductive mortaility (Table 6).
Possible reasons for the unusually high
percentage in 1951-70 have already been
discussed. In each time segment analyzed,
infants comprise the largest cohort in age
at death. The overall magnitude of infant
mortality is similar to that in a Tlaxcalan
Indian community (Halberstein and Crawford, 1972) and in Mexico for 1966:
Cuanalan, 30.09 per cent; San Pablo,
Tlaxcala, 33.33 per cent; Mexico (1966),
28.97 per cent.

A finer analysis of the sample of 460
infant deaths in Cuanalan since 1866 is

of infants has historically been well under
six months. The consistently high mortality within the first month of life is
further evidence that the time of infant

263

death has not been randomly distributed
throughout the first year.

Data on prenatal mortality was elicited
by the demographic questionnaire. Of the
275 fertile married women studied, 61
(22.18 per cent) were purported to have
suffered from some type of reproductive
wastage—at least one miscarriage, spontaneous abortion, or stillbirth. 23 of the
61 (37.7 per cent) had experienced multiple episodes.

Ages at death recalled during the demographic interview by informants for their
deceased relatives from Cuanalan are presented in Table 8. The sample of 604 individuals includes all deaths in Cuanalan
irrespective of place of origin. Several differences may be seen in comparison to the
written sources. Mean and adjusted mean
ages at death are higher for both sexes,
and males appear to have outlived females.
The frequency of infant death is much
below that disclosed by the civil documents. Failures of memory or errors in the
estimates of well-meaning informants are
probably the causes of the discrepancies.
These results should raise questions concerning the reliance upon informant reports for age-at-death information.

Table 9 specifies the time of death by
month of the year, according to the accounts in the registry. Deaths are generally
distributed throughout the year. Chisquare values of 24.54 and 21.61 at seven
degrees of freedom indicate that signifi

cant differences exist between males and typhus, anemia, hepatitis, rheumatism,

females, and between infants and the total
sample respectively. These findings are unusual since drastic seasonal changes in
climate or environment are not characteristic of the semitropical ecology of the
Valley of Mexico.

Causes of death registered in the municipal office for the combined sample (18661970) of 1,529 deaths are given in Table
10. Respiratory infections emerge as the
leading cause of death, and these include
pneumonia, pneumonitis, bronchitis, and
emphysema. ‘Gastrointestinal disorders”
denotes such conditions as gastroenteritis,
gastritis, dysentery, entercolitis, diarrhea,
parasitosis, and related diseases. The category “Ill-defined or unknown,” ranking
third and accounting for 15.56 per cent
of all deaths in Cuanalan since 1866, includes the following in the order of their
frequency: (1) childhood epilepsy; (2)
fever; (3) infantile convulsions; (4)
dropsy; (5) skin condition; (6) pain in
the side; (7) chills; (8) infection; (9)
attack or seizure (often induced by supernatural agencies); (10) tonsilitis; (11)
dehydration; (12) cerebral congestion.
“Childhood infections” is employed to
designate measles, scarlet fever, chicken
pox, whooping cough, and other infectious
diseases common to early childhood.
Drownings, poisonings, homicide, and asphyxiation are subsumed under “Accident
or violence.” “All other” causes of death,
in their order of frequency, are influenza,

 

cancer, meningitis, typhoid fever, malnutrition, congenital syphilis, diabetes, nephritis, animal bite, and apoplexy.
Omitting the “Tll-defined or unknown”
category, the three leading causes of death
are identical for males and females (Table 10). On the other hand, a number of
sexual differences may be observed. The
frequencies of female deaths due to cardiovascular dysfunction and senility are
almost double that of males, and this

is probably related to the greater longevity
of females. Accidents and violence, the
sixth Jeading cause of fatality among
males, was found to be negligible in the
death of females. The two sexes do not
appear to differ significantly in the causes
of mortality according to a chi-square
value of 21.69 with 21 degrees of freedom.

Table 11 charts the historical changes
in leading causes of death. Since 1866,
respiratory infections and gastrointestinal
disorders have increased, while ill-defined
causes and childhood infections have decreased. The high percentages of influenza
deaths during 1911-30 may be traced to a
single devastating epidemic in Cuanalan
in the last two months of 1918. In November alone, 29 lives were lost. Cirrhosis
of the liver does not emerge as a leading
cause of death until after 1930. Cardiovascular dysfunction was a rare cause of
death until the most recent time period
(1951-70), when it represented the third
ranking cause of death with a frequency
of 9.58 per cent. Cancer, the cause of only
one of the sampled deaths before 1950,
became the eighth leading cause in 1951—
70 and was responsible for 3.2 per cent of

the deaths. Among infants only, as in the
sample at large, both ill-defined causes and
childhood infections have decreased in
frequency, while the proportions of deaths
induced by respiratory conditions and gastrointestinal diseases have increased. Prematurity has also been a consistently highranking cause of death among Cuanalan
infants (Halberstein, 1973).

Table 12 identifies the leading causes
of death in Cuanalan as reported by informants for a sample of 418 deceased
relatives. The high rates of fatality from
respiratory conditions, gastrointestinal disorders, and childhood infections compare
favorably with the municipal records.
Deaths by cancer and diabetes are found
more frequently in informant responses
than in the written death notices. Neither
ill-defined and unknown causes nor senility
were counted in order to avoid possibly
faulty interpretations.

The major causes of death in Mexico
for 1960, as described by Gabaldon
(1965), are listed in Table 13. There are
some contrasts with the findings from
Cuanalan, although the differences may
result from the manner in which the

author has arranged some of the national
data. For example, pneumonia and bronchitis are separated into two categories
which, when taken together, would constitute the leading cause of death. Accidents are distinguished from homicides,
but, childhood infections and prematurity
are lumped into a single category. Ill-defined and unknown causes were responsible
for 11.11 per cent of all the deaths in
1960. The latest available data on cause
of death in Mexico (for 1964) are summarized by Preston et al., (1972, p. 456459). Their statistics also suggest that infectious diseases, including pneumonia,
bronchitis, and influenza, comprise the
leading causes of death throughout the

country, followed by diseases of early
childhood, cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, and parasitosis. Thus,
it may be said that the causes of death in
Cuanalan generally correspond to national
patterns.

The three most common agents of death
in Cuanalan are the same as those discovered in the Tlaxcalan Indian population
studied by MHalberstein and Crawford
(1972) as is shown in Table 14.

DISCUSSION

Early death has been a dominant and
pervasive phenomenon in Cuanalan, Mexico, over the past century, and it continues
to be commonplace in the community.

The present study supports Cockburn’s

of infectious diseases. Infectious diseases
have historically taken a great toll on the
Cuanalan population. In recent years, degenerative disorders have claimed an increasing proportion of lives, but respiratory
conditions, gastrointestinal diseases, and
childhood infections persist as the major
fatal agencies.

The prominence of respiratory ailments
as the leading cause of death poses a theoretical problem, Bogue (1969, p. 578)
points out that, in reality, death is often
brought about by a combination of several pathological processes. Difficulty i
breathing and/or respiratory infections
often accompany other serious conditions.
It is also possible that in the earlier time
periods respiratory disease was recorded
simply because the victim experienced erratic breathing or tracheal contractions at
the moment of expiration.

One factor contributing to the high rate
of gastrointestinal disorders in the population is the presence and consumption
of contaminated water. Although Cuanalan
possesses a system of sewers and drains for
waste disposal, the drinking water is polluted, and the means of purification are
inadequate.

The general state of health of Cuanalan
residents was observed to be substandard.
Three hundred and nine young people under age 20 were examined by Gamboa
(1972, unpublished), who found that 124,
over 40 per cent, were suffering from malnutrition. Since students were recruited by
school officials for participation in the
study, there is no reason to assume that
the sample is biased toward unhealthy
individuals seeking the medical services offered as part of the investigation. Dr.
Gamboa also diagnosed a wide variety of
pathologies in the total sample of all ages,
which represented over 25 per cent of the
community. The diseases most often encountered were clinical anemia, gastrointes

tinal disorders, and respiratory infections.
Very few of the subjects had ever previously visited a physician or dentist.

Newman (1962) points out that malnutrition often increases a population’s
vulnerability to infectious diseases. In a
Guatemalan population investigated by
Scrimshaw et al. (1959), inadequate food
intake was closely correlated with increased
frequency and severity of infections such
as pneumonia, measles, diarrhea, and tuberculosis. A similar relationship between
malnutrition and susceptibility to infectious
diseases is suggested by the Cuanalan data.

A reduction in overall and prereproductive mortality has characterized Cuanalan
since 1866. Kammeyer (1971, p. 51) and
Trewartha (1969, p. 119) point out that
a young population is partly the product
of a declining childhood and infant mortality rate. Arriaga (1970, p. 220) states
that the youthful Latin American populations of recent years is one of the consequences of mortality reductions in the
younger age groups. The age structure of
Cuanalan, constructed from the 1970 census and depicted in Figure 3, and the historical changes in mortality suggest that
these trends are apparently affecting the
community.

A sizeable proportion of young people
is represented in Cuanalan’s population
pyramid. The 0-4 age group Is the largest
single cohort, followed by the 5-9 category. The age structure of Cuanalan
strongly resembles that of the entire country of Mexico. The population pyramid for
Mexico of 1966 has a broad base. The
0-5 age cohort is numerically the largest,
comprising about 18 per cent of the total
population (Keyfitz and Flieger, 1971, p.
25). Of the total 1970 Cuanalan population, 44.9 per cent are individuals under
age 15. Ehrlich and Ehrlich (1970, p. 332)
cite 46 per cent as the 1970 Mexico national estimate. The median age of the

Fic. 3.—Population pyramid of Cuanalan, Mexico, depicting the age-sex structure of the population

according to the 1970 census of the community.

Cuanalan population is approximately 17
years: males (1,009), 16.93; females
(1,029), 17.16; total (2,038), 17.4. Cuanalan’s young population is also partly
a consequence of the high level of achieved
reproduction in the community (Halberstein, 1973).

The data from the present population
are not exactly consonant with Bogue’s
(1969, p. 550) global model of survivorship in “developing” nations. Bogue writes
that mortality is typically greatest in the
first year of life, as in Cuanalan, but that
it falls quickly in the second and third
years, until by age nine it is very low and
remains so until the mid-thirties, wherein
it gradually accelerates. For the most part,
mortality has been severe through at least
age five in Cuanalan since 1866, and a
later acceleration is not clearly visible.

The recently increasing death rate from
heart disease and other degenerative dis
 

orders in many regions of the world has
aroused speculation regarding possible
contributing demographic factors. Nye
(1967) and Campbell ( 1963) associate the
increase in fatal heart diseases with reductions in the incidence of lethal infectious diseases, especially in childhood,
which result in an older population that is
more susceptible to cardiovascular degeneration. The present findings are not in
complete accord with this theory. Coronary
disease and other degenerative disorders
have not been prominent causes of death
until the last twenty years, and life expectancy has risen at the same time. However, infectious diseases remain the leading
causes of death, and the present population
is marked by its substantial youthful constituent.

Certain of the demographic features of
the present population are favorable for
rapid evolutionary changes through natural

selection. The proportion of deaths of individuals under reproductive age has been high
in Cuanalan since 1866 (59.53 per cent),
and although the percentage has shown a
gradual decline to the present, childhood
mortality continues to claim a large segment of the population. Thus, even in a
single generation, the population experiences considerable losses of genetic material
in those individuals who die prior to
reproductive maturity. Reproductive wastage in the form of prenatal mortality occurs frequently in Cuanalan, and this also
leads to genetic discontinuity.

Cuanalan’s high levels of fertility and
prereproductive mortality and its broadbased tapering age pyramid suggest a
rapidly changing population composition,
a demographic situation which is conducive
to the swift “turnover” of genotypes
through the action of selection. In a comparison of nineteen modern Latin American populations with respect to Crow’s
(1958) index for the opportunity of natural selection, Halberstein (1973) observed
that Cuanalan ranked second highest in
both total index and the mortality component of the index. This result indicates
that the operation of natural selection is
very likely in Cuanalan and that it is
promoted by the excessive childhood mortality in the population.

Generally, agricultural populations are
marked by the highest indices for the opportunity of selection (Salzano, 1972). A
number of workers subscribe to the theory
that infectious diseases have formed the
primary selective “pressure” in recent
human evolution (Haldane, 1957; Motulsky, 1960; Blumberg, 1970; CavalliSforza and Bodmer, 1971, p. 321). In
Cuanalan, infectious diseases have historically comprised the three leading
causes of death. If certain genotypes in
this population confer greater resistance
than others to the diseases, it is probable

 

Mortality in Cuanalan, Mexico: 1866-1970

269

that natural selection would proceed at a
rapid rate and with important evolutionary
effects. Thus, one possible element involved in the historical reduction in overall
and childhood mortality in Cuanalan may
be the evolution of more resistant genotypes via the process of natural selection
through differential mortality. It is also
possible that the mortality reductions are
a result of improved medical assistance,
although this is not reflected by the current health or nutritional status of the
population. Since 1866 there has actually
been a relatively small and gradual attenuation of the extremely high childhood
death rate. Judging from the mortality patterns, the opportunity for natural selection
in Cuanalan has not been appreciably arrested over the past hundred years.

CONCLUSION

Through the examination of historical
and recent vital statistics records, census
materials, and questionnaire data, an attempt is made in the present investigation
to reconstruct the patterns of mortality
over the past century in a small agricultural population in central Mexico.

The pronounced childhood mortality in
Cuanalan since 1866 and the present age
structure of the population are demographic
attributes that are optimal for the rapid
and extensive action of natural selection.
Infectious diseases have historically comprised the leading causes of death in the
population, suggesting that the community
has been experiencing one of the more
predominant trends of recent human evolution—natural selection through infectious
diseases. The poor health of Cuanalan residents and the extremely high mortality
in the population, especially in the younger
age groups, are probably related to agricultural practices and to the consumption of
contaminated water. The gradual reduction
in overall and prereproductive mortality

in Cuanalan during the last hundred years
may be interpreted as a possible result
of selection favoring the differential survival and reproduction of disease-resistant
genotypes.
