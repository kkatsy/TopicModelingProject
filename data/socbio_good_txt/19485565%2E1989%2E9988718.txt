ABSTRACT: Recent research has examined the consequences of migration, with much of this
work focusing on “boom’’ towns. This literature provides a useful framework for studying the
consequences of population growth in other settings, however. The boom-town literature has
generally used the social disruption hypothesis, which predicts social disruptions in
communities growing rapidly through migration, to explain the results of migration in these
communities. Suicide is one social disruption indicator which has not received much empirical
attention. According to the social disruption hypothesis, a positive relationship is expected
between the net migration and suicide rates. We examine this hypothesis using data from Texas
nonmetropolitan counties for the last two decades. We also present separate analyses for
metropolitan counties. The results fail to provide support for the hypothesis. There is generally
no relationship between net migration and suicide rates in both nonmetropolitan and
metropolitan counties. Alternative explanations fail to alter this finding.

tropolitan counties experienced net
inmigration in the 1970’s compared to
only one-fifth in the 1960’s. For comparative purposes, separate analyses will
also be conducted for the state’s metropolitan counties. It is important to examine nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties separately since recent
research (Kowalski et al., 1987) suggests
that sociological explanations of suicide
are generally more applicable in urban
counties than in rural ones. The results
of this examination will allow us to determine the degree to which Texas nonmetropolitan counties have been able to
absorb population gains without significant social disturbances in the form of
people taking their own lives,

BACKGROUND

Much of the research examining the
consequences of migration in nonmetropolitan areas has focused on Western
energy-development boom towns. Although boom towns differ significantly
from other nonmetropolitan communities with regard to their source and
speed of population growth, population
composition, and so forth, the findings
from such studies provide a useful theoretical framework for studying the consequences of migration in other types of
nonmetropolitan areas. The boomtown research has generally used the social disruption hypothesis to explain the
results of population growth in such
places.

The social disruption hypothesis basically argues that populations growing
rapidly through migration tend to encounter disturbances as they attempt to
adjust to the changing conditions
brought on by population growth.
These disruptions are observed at different levels within communities. For ex
 

 

Suicide in Texas 33

ample, growth through migration signifies disturbances in the established
social ties among communities’ residents, as the migrants seek to establish
such ties within the communities (England and Albrecht, 1984). This is likely
to be problematic in situations where
the migrants are significantly different
from the “old timers” with regard to culture, values, needs, and expectations
(Price and Clay, 1980). It has been argued that population growth, in essence, results in the decline of primary
interpersonal ties and the rise of secondary impersonal bonds (Wirth, 1938;
Cortese and Jones, 1977). In addition,
the institutional infrastructure of communities are also said to be affected by
population growth (Price and Clay,
1980; England and Albrecht, 1984).
The expanding population places strains
on these institutions and organizations since more goods and services
are demanded. The social disruption hypothesis stems from the classic work of
sociologists such as Durkheim (1951),
Toennies (1957), and Wirth (1938) who
were concerned with the effects of social
change on individuals.

The empirical results tend to provide
mixed support for the social disruption
hypothesis. On the one hand, research
suggests that communities tend to experience disturbances at the institutional
and organizational levels, with community services and facilities being the most
vulnerable (Ploch, 1978; Murdock and
Leistritz, 1979). For example, England
and Albrecht (1984) observed that several Western energy-development communities experienced problems in providing different community services to
their residents. Such disruptions have
also been observed in “turnaround”
nonmetropolitan areas. Price and Clay
(1980) found that net migration was pos

itively related to residents’ perceptions
of problems in health care (including
mental health and counseling services),
educational programs and facilities,
crime and public safety, municipal services, and social welfare programs in
Michigan.

On the other hand, the findings are
less supportive of the social disruption
hypothesis at the individual level. Yet,
some observers suggest that social disorganization arises with inmigration as social ties are transformed from primary
ones to secondary ties. The forms of social disorganization attributed to migration include family disintegration
(Kohrs, 1974; Freudenburg, 1978;
Lantz and McKeown, 1979; Trovato,
1986b), substance abuse (Gilmore and
Duff, 1975; Freudenburg, 1978; Lantz
and McKeown, 1979), increasing use of
mental health services (Lantz and McKeown, 1979; Freudenburg et al.,
1982), crime (Lantz and McKeown,
1979), increasing fear of crime (Krannich et al., 1985), and declining levels of
community integration (Krannich and
Greider, 1984).

However, the social disruption hypothesis has come under attack recently. Indeed, Wilkinson et al. (1982)
questioned the validity of the findings,
particularly early ones, that have been
used to document support for the hypothesis. Other research has also failed
to provide support for the social disruption hypothesis. For example, Krannich
et al. (1985) failed to find any evidence
of higher crime rates in several boom
towns than in nonboom towns. In addition, England and Albrecht (1984)
found that several boom town communities did not experience disruptions
of social ties or declining informal ties.
Furthermore, Krannich and Greider
(1984) noted that boom town residents

Social Biology

did not report problems concerning
stress and psychological distress. Similarly, Wilkinson et al. (1983) did not find
a relationship between net migration
and divorce rates in the Old West.

Although suicide constitutes an important indicator of social disruption,
relatively little empirical attention has
focused on this area. If, indeed, migration leads to social disruptions in the social ties that serve as support systems for
people and if migration leads to pressures on the delivery of human services,
then we would expect that incidences of
suicide would increase under such conditions. One study that provides a systematic examination of the relationship
between migration and suicide is that of
Wilkinson and Israel (1984). Their
results indicate that net migration and
suicide rates are not significantly related
in Northeast counties (nonmetropolitan
and metropolitan). In addition, the findings of Kowalsi et al. (1987), while not
primarily focusing on the relationship
between net migration and suicide,
show that the two variables are not significantly related among rural U.S. counties, although net migration and suicide
are significantly positively related
among urban counties. Furthermore,
South’s (1987) study of Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSA’s) demonstrates that the 1975-80 in-migration
rate is positively related to the suicide
rate, while the out-migration rate for the
period is negatively related to the suicide rate. Other research has found a
positive association between the percentage of interstate migrants and sulcide (Stack, 1980; Trovato, 1986a), although such a measure of migration fails
to take into account the number of people who left the area.

In sum, the literature focusing on the
boom towns provides a useful perspec

tive (i.e., the social disruption hypothesis) for understanding the consequences
of population growth. We use this perspective to examine the relationship between net migration and suicide rates in
Texas nonmetropolitan counties, while
providing analysis for metropolitan
counties for comparative purposes. The
major focus On nonmetropolitan counties stems from the fact that the social
disruption hypothesis has generally
been based on nonmetropolitan boom
towns. The social disruption hypothesis
predicts a positive relationship between
the net migration and suicide rates. In
addition, this perspective would also argue that this relationship is likely to be
more positive in the nonmetropolitan
migration “turnaround” counties (e.g.,
net inmigration in the 1970’s and net
outmigration in the 1960’s) than in nonmetropolitan “nonturnaround” counties because growth in the former counties is likely to represent a relatively new
phenomenon. In order to determine
whether shifts have occurred in the relationships between the net migration and
suicide rates over time, we will examine
the effects of the net migration rates of
the 1960’s and 1970’s on the 1970 and
1980 suicide rates, respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data used in this analysis come
from three sources. First, the suicide
data for Texas counties come from U.S.
Vital Statistics for the years 1958~62,
1968-72 and 1978-82. Second, the net
migration rates for the counties are
taken from the net migration estimates
of Bowles et al. (1975) and Hwang et al.
(1985). Third, control variables included in the analysis (discussed below)
come from the 1970 and 1980 censuses.

The dependent variables are the 1970

 

Suicide in Texas 35

and 1980 suicide rates, defined as the
number of suicides per 100,000 residents
in each county in each year, respectively. Because of the relatively small
number of suicides occurring in many
counties, the suicide rates were derived
by dividing the average number of suicides taking place in the five-year period
surrounding 1970 (i.e., 1968~72) and
1980 (i.e., 1978-82) in each county by
the county’s 1970 and 1980 population,
respectively, and then multiplying by
100,000.

Some caution should be taken in interpreting our results since the suicide
rates are based on official statistical
sources and could be affected by underreporting of suicides. Gibbs’ (1971) investigation of coroners’ reports and official suicide data, however, indicate
that such data should not be abandoned
in research because the measurement
errors associated with these data tend to
be smaller than is commonly believed.
In addition, Pescosolido and Mendelsohn’s (1986) detailed study of biases
in the reporting of suicides and the consequences of such misreporting on the
testing of sociological theories provides
further support for the validity of suicide
data. These researchers found that
while suicides tend to be underreported,
this problem generally does not affect
the relationships (in magnitude or direction) between variables commonly used
to test sociological suicide theories and
suicide rates.

Our independent variables of major
interest are the counties’ 1960-70 and
1970-80 net migration rates. The net
migration estimates are derived by applying the national census survival rates
for the 1960-to-1970 and the 1970-to1980 periods to the 1960 and 1970 populations of each county, respectively.
This produces the county’s “expected”

36 Saenz

population for 1970 and 1980, which is
then subtracted from the actual 1970
and 1980 population, respectively, to
obtain the net migration estimate for the
particular decade. The net migration
rate is then obtained by dividing the net
migration estimate for each decade by
the end-of-period (i.e., 1970 and 1980)
“expected” population and multiplying
by 100, with positive rates indicating net
inmigration and negative rates signifying net outmigration.

In addition, we include five variables
(as controls) which have been observed
in the literature to be related to suicide.
First, the percentage of the county’s
end-of-period (1970 and 1980) population 25 and older with a college degree
{i.e., completed 16 or more years of
schooling) is included as a proxy for social status. Research findings provide
mixed support for the direction of the
relationship between social status and
suicide rates. For example, Trovato
(1986a) suggests that populations having high percentages of persons with
high socioeconomic statuses tend to
have lower suicide levels, but the work
of South (1984, 1987) and Pescosolido
and Mendelsohn (1986) show opposite
relationships between these variables.
Second, the percentage of the county’s
end-of-period population that lived outside of Texas (interstate migrants and
immigrants) five years prior to the census (referred to as per cent interstate migrants in the tables below) is included
because research has found a positive
relationship between this measure and
suicide (Stack, 1980; Trovato, 1986a).
Stack (1980) suggests that this arises because of the “culture shock” associated
with long-distance migration. Third, the
percentage of the county’s population
that is a minority (i.e., black or Hispanic) is included in the analysis. Re
Social Biology

search indicates that places having
higher proportions of blacks tend to
have lower suicide rates (Lester, 1985).
Hispanics have also been observed to
have lower suicide levels than Anglos
(Smith et al., 1985). Fourth, the suicide
rate in the previous decade is also included to insure that high suicide rates in
1970 or 1980 in particular counties do
not merely reflect high suicide rates at
an earlier point in time. Fifth, we include the log of the population size as a
control variable because it has been suggested that opportunities for soctal disruption increase with rising numbers of
residents (Mayhew and Levinger,
1976). It should be pointed out that
while research has shown that suicide
rates tend to increase with age (Linden
and Breed, 1976), this variable was not
included in the analysis because of a relatively strong correlation between median age and percent minority. Correlational and multiple-regression analyses
failed to find a significant relationship
between the median age and the suicide
rate in the Texas counties.

RESULTS

Table 1 presents summary statistics
for all variables used in the analysis.
While nonmetropolitan (nonmetro)
counties tended to have slightly higher

‘suicide rates in 1960 and 1970, by 1980

metropolitan (metro) counties had the
higher incidence of suicide. In addition,
among the nonmetro counties, those experiencing a migration turnaround had
higher suicide levels than their counterparts in 1960 and 1970, but by 1980 the
gap between turnaround and nonturnaround counties had disappeared.

The descriptive data also suggest that
population growth through inmigration
has been a relatively new phenomenon

for nonmetro counties. For example,
the 1960-70 and 1970-80 net migration
rates are substantially higher in metro
counties (means, 3.1 and 24.5, respectively) than in nonmetro counties (—9.5
and 7.1). Only one-fifth of nonmetro
counties (classified as such in 1980) experienced net inmigration in the 1960—
70 period, but the percentage increased
to 60.5 per cent for the 1970-80 period
(compared to 57.4 per cent and 88.9 per
cent, respectively, for metro counties).
In fact, while 28 per cent of metro counties had net inmigration flows in the
three decades from 1950 to 1980, only
1.5 per cent of nonmetro counties could
make this claim. As such, these statistics
suggest that population growth through
migration was a relatively new phenomenon for nonmetro counties in the
1970's.

These migration changes are particularly pronounced among nonmetro
turnaround counties. The number of

nonmetro counties that experienced a
migration turnaround (net outmigration
in previous decade and net inmigration
in later decade) more than doubled
from 41 counties in 1970 to 85 in 1980. In
fact, only 8.7 per cent of the nonmetro
turnaround counties (net outmigration
in 1960-70 and net inmigration in 197080) had experienced net inmigration
flows in the 1950’s compared to 26.0 per
cent among the nonmetro nonturnaround counties. These findings illustrate
the recency of population growth
through migration among the turnaround counties.

Given such changes, we can assess
the extent to which net migration rates
are related to suicide rates in nonmetro
(and metro) counties. The results show
that the 1970-80 net migration rate is
not significantly related to the 1980
suicide rate in both nonmetro (b =

tion growth through migration has not
resulted in social disruptions in the form
of suicide in either type of county during
this time. Similarly, the 1960-70 net migration rate is not significantly associated with the 1970 suicide rate in either
nonmetro (6 = 0.024) or metro (b =
—0,040) counties.

Similarly, the 1970-80 net migration
rate is not significantly related to the
1980 suicide rate among the nonmetro
turnaround and nonturnaround counties. However, the 1960-70 net migration rate is positively and significantly
related to the 1970 suicide rate among
nonmetro turnaround counties (net outmigration in 1950-60 and net inmigration in 1960-70). Yet, this finding
should be interpreted cautiously because of the relatively small number of
counties (41) that were considered turnaround counties in 1970. In effect, we

period, when population growth
through migration was taking place on a
relatively-large scale in nonmetro areas.
One can speculate that perhaps turnaround counties in the 1970’s, because
of their larger number (85) than their
counterparts a decade earlier (41), had
more models (other counties) from
which they could draw knowledge regarding strategies for coping with population growth. The turnaround counties
of the 1960’s may have had a more limited source of information on dealing
with possible consequences of such
growth.

Several control variables are significantly related to suicide. The percentage of the 1980 population living outside
of Texas in 1975 is positively related to
the 1980 suicide rate in nonmetro counties (6 = 0.288) and nonmetro nonturnaround counties (b = 0.459) and
negatively related to suicide in metro
counties (b = —0.143) (Table 2). The

Vol. 36, No. 1-2

percentage of a state’s population comprised of newcomers has been used as an
indicator of the prevalence of culture
shock on the part of migrants (Stack,
1980; Trovato, 1986a). In this sense, it
may be that the metro counties, because
of their wider diversity in population,
are able to lessen culture shock for the
newcomers.

In addition, the percentage of the
1980 population comprised of college
graduates is positively and significantly
related to the 1980 suicide rate among
nonmetro turnaround counties. This
finding is consistent with those of South
(1984, 1987) and Pescosolido and Mendelsohn (1986) who have shown that areas with higher socioeconomic statuses
tend to have higher suicide rates.

Furthermore, the percentage of the
population that is a minority (metro:
b = —0.065; nonmetro: b = —0.059)
and the log of the population size in 1980
(metro: b=1.234;  nonmetro:

= 1.071) are significantly related to
the 1980 suicide rate among both metro
and nonmetro counties. The 1980 minority percentage (b = —0.085) is significantly related to the 1980 suicide rate
among nonmetro turnaround counties,
while the log of the 1980 population size
(b = 1.492) is significantly related to the
prevalence of suicides in 1980 among
nonmetro nonturnaround counties.

The 1970 suicide rate (b = 0.472) is
significantly related to the 1980 suicide
rate only in metro counties, suggesting
that those metro counties that had high
suicide rates in 1970 tended to have high
suicide rates in 1980. Examination of the
bottom portion of Table 2 shows that
relatively few control variables were
significantly related to suicide a decade
earlier.

The degree to which the independent
variables explain the 1980 suicide rate

 

Suicide in Texas 39

varies greatly in nonmetro and metro
counties. Indeed, over 60 per cent of the
variance in the 1980 suicide rate is accounted for by the six predictor variables among metro counties, while only
12 per cent of the variance is explained
in nonmetro counties. The primary difference appears to be the strength of the
relationship between the 1970 and 1980
suicide rates in the metro counties. The
higher degree to which the independent
variables explain the suicide rates of
metro counties is consistent with the
finding of Kowalski et al. (1987) suggesting that sociological explanations of suicide are more applicable among urban
counties than rural ones. Unfortunately, factors outside of our model
which we have not identified may be
having an impact on suicide in nonmetro
counties. Perhaps more subjective factors regarding community integration
and disruptions in social ties could account for some of the unexplained variance in these counties. Once the nonmetro counties are disaggregated by
turnaround status, the predictor variables explain relatively higher proportions of the variance in the 1980 suicide
rate (turnaround counties, 32.7 per
cent; nonturnaround counties, 19.1 per
cent).

One encouraging note is that the predictor variables account for a higher
proportion of the 1980 suicide rate than
the 1970 suicide rate in each type of
county examined, with the greatest proportional increase taking place in the R?
associated with nonmetro and nonmetro nonturnaround counties. Nevertheless, it is clear that the social disruption
hypothesis is not supported, as evidenced by the general absence ofa significant relationship between net migration and suicide.

ternative explanations about the relationship between migration and suicide.
One explanation is that severing of ties
which is believed to lead to social disorganization occurs not only in counties
experiencing heavy rates of net inmigration but also in those losing large numbers of residents through net outmigration. In both of these instances, severing
of ties would occur to significant degrees. For instance, high net inmigration rates would lead to established social networks being disrupted as the
newcomers attempt to form social
bonds with other members of the community. On the other hand, the individuals left behind in counties with heavy
net outmigration also experience substantial disruptions in their social networks. Indeed, they are likely to have
lost relatives and/or friends through outmigration. In such instances, the population left behind may also need to establish new social bonds with other
members of the community to replace
those which they have lost through mi

gration. Under this scenario, we would
anticipate that the relationship between
net migration and suicide would be a
curvilinear one, with counties having
the highest levels of both net inmigration and outmigration experiencing the
highest levels of suicide and those with
more stable populations having more
moderate suicide rates.

This speculation was empirically examined with Multiple Classification
Analysis (Andrews et al., 1973). The
results of this analysis fail to provide any
support for the hypothesis (see Table 3).
The variable containing the five netmigration-rate categories is not significantly related to the suicide rate in either decade. The adjusted mean suicide
rates (adjusted for the five covariates
{control variables]) are shown in Table
3. The counties with the highest net
outmigration and particularly those with
the highest net inmigration rates do not
necessarily have the highest suicide
rates in either decade.

A second explanation that could ac

count for the failure to find a relationship between migration and suicide concerns the presence ofa statistical artifact
in the net migration measure. The net
migration rate merely represents the net
movement of people and thus masks the
magnitude of movement (in and out of
the county) that took place during the
decade. This artifact can be illustrated
by examining two hypothetical counties
with the same population size. Both
County A and County B had a net migration of 100, indicating that 100 more
people entered the county than left.
This suggests to us that both counties
had similar levels of inmigration. However, suppose that County A had 5,000
inmigrants and 4,900 outmigrants,
while County B had 200 inmigrants and
100 outmigrants. This example illustrates the “population turnover,” which
represents gross movement (in and out
of the county). Hence, we would expect
that persons in County A experienced
more social disruptions in social networks than those in County B because
of the higher turnover in the former.
Data are available from the 1980 census to measure the population turnover
rate for the 1975-to-1980 period (see
Shryock and Siegel, 1980, for a discussion of this measure). The population
turnover rate is calculated by dividing
the sum of persons moving out and into
the county between 1975 and 1980 by
the mid-period population (1977.5, with
the population for this year obtained by
taking the average of the 1977 and 1978
populations) and multiplying by 100.
We examine the hypothesis using multiple regression. The results fail to provide any support for our hypothesis
(complete results from multiple regression not shown here). While the population turnover rate has a significant, positive (b = 0.113, p<0.05 level) effect

CONCLUSIONS

Recent research has begun to address
the consequences of heavy migration.
Although much of this research has primarily focused on boom towns, it provides useful theoretical considerations
for researchers studying the consequences of migration in other settings.
The boom-town literature tends to use
the social disruption hypothesis to explain the results of migration in boom
towns. According to this perspective,

‘ social disturbances, such as the transfor
mation of social bonds from primary
ones to secondary ties, familial disruption, substance abuse, and strains on the
delivery of community services, are
likely to occur in those communities experiencing heavy rates of inmigration.
This examination has attempted to
determine the degree to which Texas
nonmetropolitan counties that experienced heavy growth through inmigration in the 1960’s and 1970's had high suicide levels in 1970 and 1980,
respectively. The results fail to provide
any support for the social disruption hypothesis. Our findings suggest that
Texas nonmetropolitan counties that
grew most rapidly through migration
during each decade did not have significantly different levels of suicide than
those places with more stable populations and those that were net exporters
of people. The same can be said for metropolitan counties and nonmetropolitan
turnaround and nonturnaround counties. Two alternative explanations—that
net migration and suicide are related ina

curvilinear manner and that net migration measure masks the volume of population movement that actually took
place—were examined to determine
whether our failure to find a relationship
between migration and suicide could be
a result of these factors. The alternative
explanations were not substantiated.

While our findings fail to lend support to the social disruption hypothesis,
does this necessarily signify that Texas
nonmetropolitan counties—and metropolitan ones for that matter—did not experience social disturbances as a result
of heavy inmigration in the last two decades? The answer to this question is a
definite “‘no.”’ Indeed, we have only examined one of a whole series of indicators of social disruption. It may be that
social disturbances have occurred in
other areas, such as divorce, crime, substance abuse, weakening of community
integration, strains on the delivery of social services, or pressures on community
facilities. Further analyses are needed in
order to determine the degree to which
Texas counties have been effective in
dealing with population growth. While
secondary data may be used in future
analyses, primary data are of utmost importance in seeking to gauge factors
such as community integration and the
disruption of social ties.

At the same time, the possibility exists that the social disruption hypothesis
developed to account for the consequences of migration in boom towns
does not apply to other areas. It is obvious that boom towns and non-boom
towns are likely to differ significantly in
various ways. For instance, the migrants
moving into boom towns are likely to
have particular characteristics associated with the employment opportunities

Social Biology

in the area. Mining communities, thus,
are likely to attract male workers, with
some of these also relocating their families to the area. In such instances, the
new residents are likely to possess a variety of characteristics that differ significantly from those of the “old timers,”
which may be an older population due
to past outmigration. In addition, the
speed at which population growth occurred is likely to be more dramatic in
boom towns than in other types of communities. Hence, these factors suggest
that the levels of adjustment necessary
to cope with changes brought on by migration are likely to be relatively more
dramatic in boom towns.

Finally, while the positive consequences of migration are often overshadowed by the negative occurrences
in the literature, it is important to realize
that migration can also have positive
benefits for the receiving areas. For instance, the new residents may bring in
expertise in areas (e.g., education, politics, and health care) that are badly
needed in the nonmetropolitan communities. In addition, while the inmigrants place strains on the delivery of
goods and services in the community,
they also may have a positive impact on
the employment situation, as more job
slots may need to be created to meet the
residents’ increasing demands. Hence,
it could be that the migrants themselves
are able to help communities adjust to
the changing conditions brought about
by their entrance into the area.
