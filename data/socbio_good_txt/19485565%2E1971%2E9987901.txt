Discriminant Analysis for Detection of

Phenylketonuric Heterozygotes

Genetic counselors, researchers concerned
with phenylketonuria, and other medical
specialists are well aware of the need to differentiate heterozygote siblings from normal siblings of phenylketonuric children as
well as to detect heterozygotes in the general population.

One method used to identify these two
groups has been the phenylalanine tolerance test, first described by Hsia, Driscoll,
and Knox (1956). In an attempt to increase
the reliability of differentiating carriers of
phenylketonuria from noncarriers, Wang,
Morton, and Waisman (1961) applied the
method of discriminant analysis (Rao, 1952)
to phenylalanine tolerance data and produced a discriminant function which gave
an overall classification error of less than 4%.
Their study compared blood constituents
of 17 parents of known phenylketonuric
cases with 19 university students who ‘had
no known family history of genetic disease.
Other studies (Rampini et al., 1969; Woolf,
Cranston, and Goodwin, 1967; Anderson
et al., 1962) also used the discriminant function to analyze phenylalanine tolerance test
data. The number of heterozygotes tested
in these studies were 19, 31, and 14 respectively.

This paper derives a discriminant func
64

 

tion by comparing 217 heterozygotes (parents of known phenylketonuric infants)
with a control group of 29 medical students
and laboratory technologists. Since this
study includes greater numbers of heterozygotes than any previous ones, the reliability of separating a population into
carriers and noncarriers for phenylketonuria
using the results of mathematical analysis
of a phenylalanine tolerance test is more accurately tested.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In conjunction with the National Phenylketonuria Collaborative Study, some preliminary data of interest to those involved
with interpretation of phenylalanine levels
and tolerance tests was published in two
papers, Berman et al. (1969) and Cunningham et al. (1969). These reports did not
include a mathematical analysis of the
data collected on blood phenylalanine (PA)
and blood tyrosine (TY) tolerance tests.
This paper analyzes the tolerance data
they collected.

The data included in the analysis were
obtained from all parents of infants with
persistent PA levels of 6 mg/100 ml or
higher and TY levels of less than 5 mg/
100 ml seen during 1964-66, and in a few

instances during the first quarter of 1967,
at one of the eleven phenylketonuria centers
located in seven states (California, Colorado,
Illinois, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
and Wisconsin). The control group consisted of medical students and laboratory
technologists who volunteered for the experiment.

For each individual a O-hour, i-hour,
2-hour, and 4-hour PA and TY blood level
were recorded following a loading dose of
100 mg of L-phenylalanine per kilogram of
body weight. Tolerance data for fasting
periods of greater than 4 hours were difficult
to obtain since increasing patient resistance
was encountered. The dose was administered in a polysaccharide gel! and following
each blood sample the plasma was separated within thirty minutes and stored
frozen until analyzed. All determinations
were performed in the same laboratory.
Blood PA and TY levels were determined
by the fluorometric method of Wong et al.
(1964) based on the procedure described by
McCaman and Robins (1962).

The day-to-day reproducibility of PA
calculated from 40 pairs of duplicates run
on separate days and expressed as a coefficient of variation was 7% and the mean
difference between duplicates was 0.35 mg
per 100 ml. The daily coefficient of variation for TY calculated on the same basis
from 38 pairs of duplicates was found to be
17.6% and the mean difference duplicates
was 0.33 mg per 100 ml.

The heterozygotes were arranged into
-two groups: parents of phenylketonuric
infants and parents of hyperphenylalanemic
infants. This classification was founded on
an arbitrary division of an apparently continuous variable, blood PA. An infant was
classified hyperphenylalanemic if it exhibited soon after birth a blood serum PA level
of at least 6 mg/100 ml but less than 20
mg/100 ml and a blood TY of less than 5
mg/100 ml; while an infant was classified

phenylketonuric if it had a blood serum PA
level greater than 20 mg/100 ml and a
blood TY of less than 5 mg/100 ml. A
complete series of data was acquired for
177 parents of phenylketonuric infants,
40 parents of hyperphenylalanemic infants, and 29 controls. For a more detailed
discussion of the loading methods and of
the classification of cases, see the recent
publications of Berman et al. (1969) and
Cunningham et al. (1969),

Linear discriminant functions were used
to analyze the data because this analysis
provides a means of assigning an individual
to one of two populations. The multivariate
observation concerning the individual are
reduced to a single score, which is a weighted
combination of the variables observed, and
this may be used to assign the individual
to one of the populations, either heterozygotes or normals.

The model for the discriminant score,
®, is as follows:

b= Dax
where =
\ = Coefficients (or weights) based on samples from the two populations,
= variable observed, and

k = number of variables observed.

In this study & equals eight. The eight
variables, x1, x2, . -- x8, used in the analysis
are the natural logarithms of the 0-hour,
1-hour, 2~hour, and 4-hour PA and TY
levels. Logarithms were used in order to
better approximate a normal distribution
of each variable.

The “perfect discriminant” as described
by Kendall (1957) and Kenny and Keeping
(1951) was used because it allows the use
of standard regression techniques in computation. Using this perfect discriminant,
the BMD O2R Stepwise Multiple Regression Program (Dixon, 1965) was converted
into a stepwise discriminant function program and then applied to the loading data

of the three groups. Because the BMD O2R
program could only be performed on two
groups at a time, the first test was run between the parents of hyperphenylalanemic
infants and parents of phenylketonuric infants to see if these groups could be pooled.
The stepwise multiple regression program
was converted into a stepwise discriminant
analysis program by using the perfect discriminant process of weighting each individual in each of the two groups in the
following manner:

Let WN, be the number of parents of
phenylketonurics and Nz be the number of
parents of hyperphenylalanemics. Score
each parent of a phenylketonuric child with

Y= ——— = — = 0.1843,

and score each parent of a hyperphenylalanemic child with

These scores were used in setting up the
equations to be solved for the A. The problem was then analyzed as a regression
analysis of these scores on the eight independent variables. This required calculation
of the sums of squares and products matrix
and solution of the resulting equations for
the coefficients, }. The \ (which can be
thought of as partial regression coefficients)
are estimates of the change in the discriminant, ®, resulting from a unit change in
the variable x when all other variables are
held constant. If \ is not significantly different from zero, then X is not contributing
significantly to the discriminant. However,
it is often the case that many of the x correlated with others, and the test of significance of the individual partial regression
coefficient in this situation is not a test of
the complete contribution of the variable.
A more detailed discussion of the mathematical model used in discriminant analysis
can be found in Brown (1947).

Social Biology

In this instance the scores VY; and VY,
were used as the ninth (the dependent)
variable in the multiple regression, and at
each step the program gave the coefficients
for the discriminant function comparing
the parents of phenylketonurics with the
parents of hyperphenylalanemics.

RESULTS

In the discriminant function analysis
comparing parents of phenylketonurics with
parents of hyperphenylalanemics, it was
found that the single best discriminant was
the 2-hour PA value and the second best
discriminant the 2-hour TY value. The
entire discriminant function was:

@ = —0.105 (1-hour PA) +0.315 (2-hour
PA) —0.061 (4-hour PA) -+0.029
(O-hour TY) +0.329 (1-hour TY)
—0.718 (2-hour TY) +0.309 (4-hour
TY).

The program stopped after seven steps
leaving out the least important discriminant, the 0-hour PA, since deletion of this
variable did not lower the significance of
the function.

Using this method it was impossible to
discriminate between parents of phenylketonurics and parents of hyperpheny]lalanemics. Figure 1 shows the complete overlap of the two groups when the values of the
discriminant equation were plotted for each
individual. These findings indicated that
the similarities between the groups were
great and that it was futile to attempt to
distinguish between them.

The second analytic procedure used was
to pool the two parental groups and compare them to the controls. The data were
then arranged into a group of 217 parents
(heterozygotes) and 29 controls and analyzed by multiple regression techniques.
Again, the stepwise multiple regression program was converted into a stepwise discriminant analysis program by weighting
each individual with a score. In this case,

The scores became the dependent variable in the multiple regression equation
and at each step the program printed the
discriminant function coefficients. Using
these two groups, the best single discriminant was the 4-hour PA, and the second
best discriminant the 2-hour TY. The full
discriminant equation was:

which had a 0.9% false negative classification error (2 true hetoerozygotes whom the
analysis classified normal) and a 27.6%
false positive classification error (8 true
normals whom the analysis classified heterozygotes).

Social Biology

The distribution had a cutting point of
0.366. That is, if the equation when evaluated for a set of blood constituent levels
yielded a number greater than 0.366 then
the individual was classified normal; if the
result was less than 0.366 then the individual was classified heterozygote.

The mean and standard deviation for
the 8 variables in each of the 4 groups are
given in Table 1, Table 2 gives the variable
entered at each step, the discriminant function at that step, the cutting point minimizing misclassification error, the multiple
correlation coefficient, R?, indicating the
fraction of all variation that is accounted
for by the variables included at that step,
and the per cent error at that level. In this
table several entries deserve comment. In
theory, the classification error should continuously decrease as more variables are
added to the equation. That this does not
happen is due to random sampling error.
The cutting point should be the same
throughout all steps, and although the
points are all contiguous, they are not
identical. This, again, is due to sampling
error. Along with the frequency histogram
for parents of phenylketonurics and parents
of hyperphenylalanemics, Figure 1 also

tribution of discriminant scores for the
total parental group and the control group,
one using all 8 variables and another using
only the 4 most important variables.

DISCUSSION

When the discriminant function derived
in our study is compared to the one derived
in a similar study by Wang et al. (1961)
several differences are found. Their single
most important discriminant, the O-hour
PA, is third ranking in importance in our
equation; whereas, the 4-hour PA and the
2-hour TY, ranking first and second in our
equation, were dropped in theirs. In our
equation, the 4-hour PA is more than two
and one-half times as powerful as the next
best discriminant, and an equation using
this one variable alone has a 1.8% false
negative classification error with a 44.8%
false positive classification error (see Table
2). While they dismissed all TY values as
insignificant, our study shows that the
2-hour TY is the second most powerful
variable. There are several possible explanations for these differences: (1) a larger sample was used in our study which probably
produced a more reliable factor estimator;
(2) in each study different methods of
loading were used and slightly different
amounts of phenylalanine were ingested
by the subjects; (3) 1.5 and 3-hour blood
level determinants were included in their
analysis, which were unavailable in ours.
One particular finding stands out in both
studies, namely that the area under the
tolerance curve is not a good discriminant
because several of the variables are weighted
with a negative coefficient. Care was taken
in both studies to use only adult controls.

Statistically, it is possible that there are a
number of different discriminant equations,
each of which is capable of classifying a
population into two groups, carriers and
normals with only a small percentage of
error. In order to have this effect, the most
powerful variables in each equation would

Social Biology

have to be highly correlated. For example,
again comparing our equation to that of
Wang et al. (1961), if the 4-hour PA in
our study were correlated with their 0-hour
PA and our 2-hour TY were correlated to
their 3-hour PA then both equations would
give similar results, even though they appear quite different. We could not test this
hypothesis since we do not have both sets
of data, but within our series the correlation
of 4-hour PA with Q-hour PA was only
0.407.

Another explanation of the different results is that Wang et al. (1961) may have
had too few heterozygotes to compute a
stable discriminant function, particularly
since the variablility of each factor studied
is rather high (see Table 1).

Rampini et al. (1969) also used similar
methodology to that used in this study
when he analyzed the tolerance data from
19 heterozygote parents and 26 controls
after orally administering 100 mg of PA
per kilogram of body weight. The age of
controls is not given. He recorded the 0,
1, 2, 3, and 4 hour PA and TY values of
these 45 individuals and performed the discriminant analysis procedures on this data.
He does not list a stepwise function or explain the power of the various parts of his
equation, and thus we do not know whether
or not his 4~hour PA weighed heavily in
the overall discriminant power. Woolf et al.
(1967), and Anderson et al. (1962) have
also used discriminant analysis. but their
methods were quite disparate and the results varied considerably.

Other investigators have used PA tolerance tests to detect phenylketonuric carriers, but did not analyze their data with
the discriminant analysis technique. In two
of these studies, Renwick, Lawler, and
Cowie, (1960) who compared 18 carriers
with 20 controls and Hsia et al. (1956, 1957)
who compared 19 carriers with 19 controls,
the 4-hour PA was found to be the best
classifier.

 
Vol. 18, No. 1

The calculation of this complex mathematical model yields the rather high false
positive classification of 8 out of 29 controls (27.6%). This error rate should be
compared with that of other studies using
the discriminant analysis technique. Rampini et al. (1969) had 1 false positive out of
26 controls (3.8%), and Wang et al. (1961)
had no false positives among his 19 controls.
Woolf et al. (1967) correctly classified 92%
of normals and heterozygotes, but does not

+5 (1962) correctly identified 95% of normals

Show much of the classification error is due
A to false positive identification.

S One explanation of the false positive
identifications in our study as well as the
“ others is that a number of the false positives
were unknown heterozygotes. It is also pos‘sible that if a larger number of controls
-zwere available for this study a smaller
classification error would have resulted.
A third explanation is that tolerance tests
pmay perform quite well in reconfirming
Z known heterozygotes but less well in classi‘2 fying large unknown populations. Rampini
et al. (1969) report higher variability among
ptheir heterozygotes than in controls and
suggest that this indicates a genetic hetero3 geneity of the alleles on the phenylketonuria
"elocus or the presence of other modifying
© genes.

Practical usefulness of the discriminant
function approach is limited due to a number of problems. For those investigators
who wish to use the discriminant function
model demonstrated in this analysis it is
stressed that only adults should be tested.
There is evidence that blood PA and TY
levels may not be constant over age (Renwick et al., 1960; Hsia et al.. 1957). That
is, an individual as a child may have a
higher blood PA and TY level than he
will as an adult. For this reason, all of the

Phenylketonuric Heterozygotes 71

individuals in our study were adults. There
also is evidence that slight changes in the
loading procedure, such as dose, vehicle,
timing, method of collection. handling and
analysis of blood samples, may lead to significantly different PA and TY values
(Cunningham et al., 1969), and for this
reason it is necessary that each investigator derive his own equation. If this is
impossible, any investigator wishing to
apply the function derived in this study
must take care to follow the exact procedures given above, Any borderline values
should be vigorously analyzed bearing in
mind the high false positive rate yielded
by this function,

The use of the discriminant analysis
function represents an attempt to extend
the basic biochemical data obtained in
tolerance tests, but obviously cannot improve the results if the groups tested are
not affected by a homogeneous biochemical
disorder. Since loading tests involve a
variety of metabolic functions such as
absorption, intermediary metabolism, and
excretion, the process consists of several
steps each of which may vary in a quite
different manner. Our data tend to confirm
the opinion of Cunningham et al. (1969)
that although the tolerance test gives
quite good results in reconfirming known
heterozygotes, it has a relatively limited
usefulness in classifying normal controls or
suspected heterozygotes, even when the
results are subjected to rather sophisticated
mathematical analysis.

SUMMARY

A stepwise discriminant analysis program
was used in an attempt to distinguish parents of phenylketonuric infants (infants with
blood serum phenylalanine higher than 20
mg/100 ml) from parents of hyperphenylalanemic infants (infants with blood serum
phenylalanine between 6 and 20 mg/100
ml) on the basis of serum PA and TY levels.
Using the results of this analysis it was imDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:54 08 December 2015

possible to distinguish between the two sets
of parents.

When data from both parental groups
were pooled and the discriminant analysis
was applied to this heterozygote group and
to a group of controls, the test results accurately differentiated the two groups. A
simple discriminant function giving approximately 96% accuracy of classification
between parents (parents of both phenylketonuric and hyperphenylalanemic infants)
and controls was obtained as follows:

® = 0.319 (O-hour PA) +0.677 (4-hour
PA) +0.295 (0-hour TY) —0.646
(2-hour TY)

where a value of less than 0.255 indicated a
control. The one step equation

using 0.554 as a cutting point gave a 6.9%

overall classification error. The most powerful single discriminant was the 4-hour PA
value and the second most powerful, the
2-hour TY.

As stated above the overall classification
error in the complete equation is about 4%,
but false positive classification was much
greater, approximately 25%. For this reason, the PA tolerance test is not a totally
reliable device for distinguishing heterozygotes from normals in a population, with
or without mathematical analysis.
