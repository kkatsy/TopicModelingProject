ABSTRACT: This paper revisits and extends an inquiry on the age-at-menarche differential fecundity hypothesis. Earlier studies have interpreted the difference in the onset of female pubertal
maturation as indicative of biological differences in fecundity between early and late menarcheal
women. Using the WFS data for Sudan, the authors address the entire reproductive life of the
women in terms of their transition from one parity to the next, as well as the speed with which
birth intervals are closed, as a way to infer biological fecundity among the women. The study
concludes that there is little evidence that early menarcheal women are more fecund than their

late puberty counterparts.

Although there is little agreement
among scholars on how the mechanisms
involved actually predispose early menarche girls to early sexual and reproductive
activities in comparison to late maturing
girls, research efforts have interpreted the
differences in the onset of female pubertal
maturation as the index of biological differences in fecundity between early and
late menarcheal women. This interpretation was given by Ryder and Westoff
(1971) to the results of their study, to the
extent that these differences are believed
to persist throughout the reproductive life
span of women. Udry and Cliquet (1982)
have hypothesized and concluded that
women with early puberty are more fecund than women with late puberty, leading to earlier births for a given exposure
to the risk of pregnancy. In fact, Udry
(1979) was more categorical, stating that
“those women with early puberty have
more efficient functioning reproductive
systems, leading to higher fecundability
independent of sexual behavior.” This

conclusion, in our opinion, must suggest—especially in populations which are
governed by natural fertility—that early
maturers are necessarily and systematically different from those with late menarche in their process of family building.
This paper revisits this question by examining the ways in which the reproductive behavior of a woman is determined
by how early or how late in adolescence
she has attained her puberty. Addressing
the entire reproductive life of women (in
order to examine the claim that these differences persist throughout the reproductive life), we study the transition from one
parity to the next, as well as the speed or
timing of reproduction, using birth intervals and parity progression ratios from
which we may infer biological fecundity
among women. We contend that while the
initiation phase of the family-building
process poses no problem, as it has indeed
been observed that puberty is a potent factor in discriminating age at marriage
(Otor, 1995; Presser, 1978; Udry, 1979;

Vol. 45, No. 3-4

Udry and Cliquet, 1982; Zelnik, 1981),
the problem is with the subsequent phases
as they embody the actual reproduction.

The family-formation process is viewed
as the progression of women through marriage and first, subsequent, and last births.
The process consists of three phases—initiation, expansion, and completion
(Pandey and Suchindran, 1989). With respect to the first phase, some approaches
have emphasized the role of socioeconomic factors as the sole determinants of
how soon a woman enters into marriage
for future family-building activity (Blossfeld and Huinink, 1991). Though this can
hardly be denied, these approaches have
been oblivious to the fact that there is a biological substrate which predisposes some
people to earlier marriage than others.
Whether or not puberty acts independently
on age at marriage or is mediating the effect of socioeconomic factors is not entirely clear because empirical evidence regarding this relationship is not conclusive.

On the other hand, the expansion and
completion phases are concerned with the
fact that the family begins to function as a
reproductive unit with the onset of first
birth and subsequent and last births. The
importance of considering the last two
phases in an investigation like the present
one lies in the fact that the intervals between successive births, especially in natural fertility populations, shed light on the
fecundity of women. For instance, the average length of closed birth intervals is influenced by the overall level of fecundity
(Srinivasan et al., 1987; Tsui, 1982). The
family formation process, thus, can be a
useful way of testing the age-at-menarche
differential fecundity hypothesis.

In an attempt to carry out this test, we
decompose the age at which the family
formation process 1s completed (i.e., the

Differential Fertility

247

age at last birth) into its constituent parts
for each menarche group or “maturation
status.” Here maturation status consists of
three age-at-menarche categories: early
maturation (EM) which includes early maturers, 1.e., those who attained menarche
by ages 12 and below; midway maturation
(MM) which includes midway maturers or
those who attained their menarche between 13 and 14 years; and late maturation
(LM) which includes late maturers or
those who attained their menarche by ages
15 and above. It may be pointed out that
this classification is not entirely arbitrary.
Rather, it has been decided on the basis of
the generally held view about early and
late female pubertal timing.

Age at last birth has undoubtedly been
the subject of methodological controversy.
In particular, this controversy has centered
on the fact that while the age at last birth
has been claimed as an indicator of stopping behavior (Knodel, 1987), it has also
been considered as reflecting changes in
spacing behavior (Koo et al., 1987; Pandey
et al., 1993). For instance, Anderton
(1989) has argued that increases in interlive birth interval may be anticipated to increase open intervals and thereby lower
age at last birth. Notwithstanding this controversy, age at last birth can be a good
measure for our purpose at hand, in so far
as the onset of infecundity in women in
natural fertility situations is concerned.
McDonald and Knodel (1989), for example, have noted that a woman with n births
is precluded from having the (n + J)th
birth because, given the existing pattern of
birth intervals, she becomes infecund before sufficient time has elapsed to have the
next birth. The nth birth, thus, becomes
her last birth. In this situation of natural
fertility, therefore, age at last birth is
determined by age at onset of infecundity

248

and the distance in time that the nth birth
happens to precede the onset of infecundity. The present discussion is not intended to distinguish between the effect
of stopping and spacing behaviors on age
at last birth. Rather, it is concerned with
physiological fecundity. Hence, the controversy is of little relevance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A decision on the formulation that
links the age at last birth with its constituent or component parts is a crucial
step in providing the estimates required.
Knodel (1987), who followed McDonald’s (1984) earlier work, has provided
such a formulation, but he has assumed
the mean birth intervals to remain constant over the women’s parity. Variation
in the birth interval was introduced by
Suchindran and Koo (1992), such that the
mean age at last birth (ALB) is given by,

ALB =AFB+ >, FBI, (1)

i=2

where, AFB is the mean age at first birth,
F,= m~ )PPR, the probability of having
an ith-order birth, and BI,, the mean birth
interval between (i—/)th and ith birth, and
k, the maximum attainable parity. In fact,
McDonald (1984), whose formulation
was turned the other way round as seen
above, was actually concerned with the
fact that a woman’s completed fertility is
the outcome of when she starts having
births, when she stops, and the length of
intervals between successive births. With
this assumption, he used the following relationship:

B= s(1+2-M—F) (2)

where, B denotes the mean number of
children ever born to a group of women;

Otor and Pandey

 

Social Biology

S denotes the proportion of these women
who have at least one birth; Z is the mean
age at last birth; M is the mean age at
marriage among women who ever have a
birth, and F and J, respectively, represent
the mean length of the first birth interval,
and the mean length of interlive birth intervals. McDonald has used this model to
develop a method of stepwise standardization. In addition to Suchindran and
Koo’s formulation above, we shall employ this standardization procedure to assess the relative impact of these components by puberty.

Use is also made of Suchindran and
Koo’s formulation employing the decomposition methodology developed by Das
Gupta (1991). Here the difference between two menarche-group mean ages at
last birth is decomposed into the effects
of the differences in five factors—one
scalar factor and four vector factors.
These factors are age at first birth, earlier
PPR’s, later PPR’s, earlier birth intervals,
and later birth intervals, that is,

ALB = F(A,B,C,D,E) (3)

where,

A = age at first birth,

B = (PPR,, PPR,), or a vector-factor comprising PPR’s to second and third order births,

C = (PPR,, PPR,, ...), or a vector-factor
comprising PPR’s to the fourth order
and higher order births,

D = (BI, BI;), ora vector-factor comprising the mean birth intervals to the
second and third order births.

E = (BI,, BI, ...), or a vector-factor comprising the mean birth intervals to the
fourth through higher order births.

Das Gupta’s formulation permits the examination of the consequences for mean
age at last birth of the simultaneous
changes in all five factors. Suppose that the
factors assume the values of (a,b,c,d,e) in
the midway maturers (MM) and
(A,B,C,D,E) in the late maturers (LM), for
instance. Then the difference in their mean
ages at last birth is

DATA AND ANALYSIS

This analysis utilizes data from the individual survey of 3,115 women from the
WES for Sudan (or SUDFS) carried out between December 1978 and April 1979. Reference to “Sudan” in any analysis based on
the WFS data, in fact, is a matter of convenience as the survey covered only the six
northern regions of the country, referred to as
“Northern Sudan,” as opposed to the remaining three regions, “Southern Sudan.” The
two are farther apart in religious beliefs than
in anything else, Northern Sudan being primarily a Muslim population while Southern
Sudan largely professes traditional African
beliefs. However, the social factors that predispose women to marriage and its consummation apparently are the same, and different
from those in some parts of India where 6 to
8 months elapse between marriage and the
time when cohabitation takes place (Pandey
et al., 1990). Richard and Galal el Din
(1982) believe that some of these factors that
hasten cohabitation, evidently irrespective of
religious beliefs, in Sudan are:

(i) the fear of loss of virginity and the consequent loss of honor and bride price
(which is paid by the father of the bridegroom to the father of the bride);

Differential Fertility

249

(ii) the fact that marriage and childbearing
are the most important functions in a
woman’s life, and parents have no
benefit in delaying their daughter from
fulfilling the second function (e.,
childbearing) once she has been given
in marriage;

(iii) the desire of the groom’s mother to
have household help.

In using the WFS data, there are a
number of analytical implications. We
will note that overall, 2,898 of the 3,115
women reported their ages at menarche.
Of the remaining 217, only 5 had not
started menstruating at the time of the interview, while the other 212 women did
not state anything about their menarche.
Generally, the WFS sample ts extended
only to women aged below 50. Thus, a
high proportion of these women will not
have completed their fertility by the time
of the survey. Therefore, the choice of
women included for analysis in this paper
had to be done within at least two constraints: one was to include a reasonably
large number of women; the other was to
choose them in such a way that they have
an exposure period long enough to have
completed their fertility.

The choice of the area to be covered by
the WFS is a potential methodological
problem when analyzing the data, particularly with respect to the religion variable.
Because this survey was exclusively conducted in the Muslim North of the country, there were only 2 per cent of nonMuslim women included in the sample.'

'We are grateful to a reviewer who has drawn our
attention to the usefulness of carrying out a comparative
analysis of Muslim and non-Muslim populations to determine the influence of religion on events, such as the
consummation of marriage in Sudan. This approach,
however, has been precluded by this methodological
problem.

Probably because of this paucity of numbers, there was no significant difference
between the mean ages at menarche for
Muslim and non-Muslim women. More
interesting, there was no significant difference between the mean ages at menarche for literate and illiterate women for
the whole sample (Otor, 1989, 1995).

The 740 women included are those of
the first 15-year birth cohort of 1928-42.
In other words, the women included are
those who were over 35 years old at the
survey date, 1978/79. While it is desirable to have as long an exposure period
as possible, this remedy comes at the expense of a number of other things, among
them the memory lapse with respect to
birth events which characterizes older
women. For example, when respondents
are asked to reconstruct their reproductive life histories and recall the dates of
birth events, they are likely to forget
events, in which case the birth intervals
could be lengthened. Also, they may misdate events, which could either lengthen
or shorten intervals. A further problem 1s
related to the selective maternal mortality
of women of higher parity. While these
problems are almost always associated
with this type of data, there is little reason to suppose that their effect would
vary from one menarche group to another.

RESULTS

Assuming that the methodological
problems cited above would affect the
data in a manner that does not preclude
comparison among menarche groups, the
parity and birth interval distributions may
be used to study the effect of puberty on
the family formation process. Table 1
gives the 740 women of the 1928-42

birth cohort according to how they are
distributed by maturation status and other
particulars.

In Tables 2 and 3, respectively, input
values extracted from Table 1 are found
for McDonald’s model and Suchindran
and Koo’s model. To study the comparative impact of reproductive behavior on
fertility according to whether the women
are early or late maturers, we first adopt a
“stepwise standardization” procedure of
McDonald (1984). Using the parameters
of his model, McDonald developed five
ratios of mean number of births in a
given population to the “standard” population. These ratios are intended to gauge
the extent to which fertility is altered by
different behaviors in the given population compared to those in the standard
population. The ratios are B,,/ B,,,, Be /
Bog By / Bop By! Bog Bg / Bory» where,

Baa = Sod ! - Ltd Zz Moa Z Fuad (5)
I std

and B,,, Bp, B,, B,, Bs are the new fertility values obtained by substituting in
stepwise fashion the values of the parameters from the given population for the
standard values. For example, B,, is obtained by substituting the value of M
from the given population for the standard value M_,,; B,, is obtained by substituting the values of M and F from the
given population for the standard values
M,,, and F,,; and so on. Finally, B, is obtained by substituting the values of all the
parameters from the given population for
all the standard values. McDonald has
defended, on a logical ground, his ordering of the parameters in the ways they appear in stepwise procedure, that is, the
initial parameters—age at marriage and
first birth interval—to be entered are the
starting parameters. He reasoned that if a

woman has some idea that her fertility
will end around a particular age, then it
will be more appropriate to enter L before J. Finally, S parameter is entered last
because it is more a group adjustment
factor than a measure of individual behavior. It may be pointed out that McDonald has generated a hypothetical standard population by combining median
values of M, FL, I and S for 34 WFSpopulations.

The first of these ratios, B,,/ B,,., indicates the extent to which fertility would
be altered by the different exposure time
deriving from age at marriage in the given
population compared to that in the standard population. This ratio does not allow
for the level of age-specific fecundity during the increment of exposure time. The
fecundity factor is largely taken into account when, with the second ratio, B, /
B.,» the length of the first birth interval of
the given population is included. The
length of the first birth interval also embodies the influences of factors such as delay consummation, tregularity of sexual
intercourse early in marriage, and premarital births or pregnancies. Hence, the second ratio reflects the impact of variation of
the age at first birth. With the third ratio, B,
/ B,,» the additional impact of stopping
(reflecting the onset of infecundity in
women) is included. While the fourth ratio,
B,/ B,,» is expected to reflect the overall
level of fecundity, the fifth ratio, By / B.,
shows the influence of primary sterility.

In applying this methodology, we have
chosen as our “standard population” the
early maturers (i.e., EM-population) while
the midway maturers (MM-population)
and late maturers (LM-population) form
our study populations. Using the input
values given in Table 2, the results of the
stepwise standardization are obtained as

Otor and Pandey

 

Social Biology

presented in Table 4 and plotted in Figure
1.2 The impact of the particular behavior
can be gauged from the line preceding
the plotted point. For instance, if the line
slopes upward, the parameter (in question) is contributing to higher fertility
than the standard. On the other hand, if
the line slopes downward, the parameter
is contributing to lower fertility than the
standard. A relatively horizontal line is an
indication that there is very little variation from the standard.

Because age at marriage is late for
MM and LM compared to the “standard
population,” the influence of age at marriage (M) is toward lower fertility in both
MM and LM than in the standard. This
effect is offset by relatively shorter F in
the MM-population while it is increased
by relatively longer F in the LM population, compared to the standard, which is
indicated by the appropriate change—an
increase (decrease) by 2 percentage points
in MM-population (LM-population)—in
the second ratio (B, / B,,,) after addition
of F A late stopping (.e., higher age at
last birth) in both MM and LM is contributing to higher fertility than the standard. Thereafter, the last three ratios produce a relatively horizontal line in each
case, which indicates that the addition of J
and S hardly introduce any variation from
the standard. In fact, the fifth ratio in the
case of MM-population is 100, indicating
that the level of fertility is the same after
the addition of S (see Table 2).

*The five ratios are graphed as Figure 1. The graph
indicates the behavior of the ratios after the subsequent
substitution of the parameters. Thus, on the horizontal |
scale, | represents the substitution of M, 2 represents
the substitution of F, 3 represents the substitution of I,
and 5 represents the substitution of S. We note that
these numbers do not indicate any values of these parameters.

To summarize our McDonald modelbased analysis, we find that the impact of
age at last birth dominates the variation
in fertility, which is clear from the fact
that the slope of the line between F and L
is comparatively steep, and it is steeper
with respect to LM-population. Had the
stopping been necessarily dictated by the
onset of physiological infecundity among
later maturers, we believe that such a pattern would not have been possible. Further, the overall fecundity is represented
by the average length of interlive birth intervals, and primary sterility is represented by the proportion of women with
one or more births. The absence of any
change following the addition of J and S
indicates that these factors do not substantially vary from early puberty to later
puberty.

The next analysis is based on Suchindran and Koo’s model. An extension of
Knodel’s (1987) model, it is an exact formulation relating age at last birth to age
at first birth, birth intervals of different
orders, and PPR’s. We also use Das
Gupta’s decomposition methodology. The
input data are provided in Table 3. It may
be noted that in this application, PPR, is
to be taken as unity since we restrict our
attention to those women who ever have
a birth. Further, as age at first birth is one
of the factors included, the birth intervals
include only inter-live-birth intervals as a
set of factors. The results of decomposition are shown for the menarche groups
in Table 5. Generally, the results demonstrate that these factors contribute to
changes in age at last birth in different
ways. As the table shows, age at first
birth contributes to increase the group
difference in mean age at last birth. In
contrast, there is a tendency in PPR’s to
reduce the difference, while for all practi

cal purposes inter-live-birth intervals contribute nothing to this difference. Splitting PPR’s into earlier and later reveals
where the reduction effect is concentrated.

“MM vs. EM” shows the group difference of 0.66 in the age at last birth, which
is the total effect as a result of the simultaneous influence of all the five factors.
Of this, 0.9 years (or 136 per cent of total
effect) can be attributed to age at first
birth. In comparison to EM, MM has
smaller PPR’s. This fact has contributed
to the reduction of MM’s mean age at last
birth by 0.23 years, 39 per cent (or 0.99
years), the remaining 61 per cent (or
0.14) of which is contributed by earlier
and later parities respectively. Further,
the MM’s relatively shorter earlier birth
intervals have contributed to a younger
age at last birth by 0.01 years. Finally, the
higher-order birth intervals have contributed nothing to the group difference
in mean age at last birth. Similar comparative analysis is presented in the same
table for LM vs. EM. Here, it is observed
that the way the five factors contribute to
the group difference in mean age at last
birth displays, generally, the same pattern
as that of MM vs. EM. What needs mentioning, however, is that, of 1.45 years reduction in LM’s mean age at last birth,
only 17 per cent (0.25 years) is contributed by earlier PPR’s, while the remaining 83 per cent (or 1.20 years) is
contributed by late PPR’s.

To summarize the results of the decomposition, we find that the greatest
contribution to the difference in age at
last birth between early and late maturers
(1.e., midway and late maturers) is the
later maturers’ ages at first birth. The second contribution is the later maturers’
much lower PPR’s to the fourth- and

that, aside from age at first birth, it is the
quantum that matters in differentiating
the menarche groups.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The two analytical procedures followed in this paper approach our purpose—to investigate whether or not reproductive behavior among women is
dependent on how early or late they attain their puberty—from opposite directions. First, the use of McDonald’s equation leads us to treat the completed
fertility as a function of age at marriage,
the first birth interval, inter-live-birth intervals, age at last birth, and the proportion of women who ever have a birth.
Suchindran and Koo’s procedure,on the
other hand, centers on age at last birth as
a function of all these factors, including
completed fertility. The use of these procedures together not only emphasizes but
also supplements the results from each
other. For example, effects of age at marriage and the first birth interval can be
discerned in the case of the first method,
which is not possible in the second
method since the two variables are com

bined into age at first birth. This fact is
important if we have to evaluate an important assumption of Udry and Cliquet
(1982). The assumption has to do with
these authors’ view that differences in
age at onset of puberty are an index of
differences in biological fecundity. More
precisely, the assumption is that age at
first birth for late menarcheal women is
not late simply because of delayed marriage, but because, given marriage, they
are less fecund. This assumption may be
countered empirically by considering
mean age at marriage and mean lengths
of first birth interval for EM and MM,
which are 15.87 and 3.86, and 17.17 and
3.46, respectively. We do find that, indeed, age at first birth for MM (in relation to EM) is late because of delayed
marriage, since the mean first birth interval is shorter than that of EM.

Another occasion for the need to treat
age at marriage and the first birth interval
separately is when certain factors have to
be accounted for. We have seen earlier
that the first of McDonald’s five ratios,
B,, / B,, does not make allowance for
the level of age-specific fecundity applying during the increment of exposure
time. Rather, it is the length of the first
birth interval that encapsulates the influDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

ence of not only age-specific fecundity
but also other factors such as delay in
consummation, the extent of frequency of
intercourse early in marriage, and premarital births, or that midway maturers
are more sexually active, or biologically
superior, or both, to early maturers.

Further to our McDonald-model-based
analysis, we find that the impact of age at
last birth dominates the variation in fertility. Had the stopping been necessarily
dictated by the onset of physiological infecundity for later maturers, then there
would be no apparent reason for the slope
of the line between F and L to be the
steepest of the slopes. In other words,
later maturers would have stopped much
earlier than they actually did. Further, the
absence of any change in fertility following the addition of J and S (those factors
that reflect overall fecundity and primary
sterility) indicates that these factors are
not substantially variable from early to
late puberty.

The second procedure allows us to examine the consequences of simultaneous
influence of all five factors on mean age
at last birth. This procedure, which has
incorporated the variation in inter-livebirth intervals, has confirmed at least two
points with respect to the first procedure:
that inter-live-birth intervals do not contribute to the differences—in terms of
completed fertility or age at last birth—
between menarche groups and that interlive-birth intervals do not change with
parity. Further, the bifurcation of parity
progression into earlier and later progressions has given insight into how the
quantum effect has contributed to the
menarche group difference in mean age
at last birth. The contribution is highly
skewed in the case of LM vs. EM, with
earlier PPR’s contributing 17 per cent

while the remaining 83 per cent is attributed to later PPR’s. In the case of MM vs.
EM, the imbalance in contribution is
moderate. Here, earlier PPR’s contribute
39 per cent, and the rest (i-e., 61 per cent)
is attributed to later PPR’s.

The absence of effect of inter-livebirth intervals on the menarche-group
difference in age at last birth has reduced
our task to explaining only the PPR component, the next important factor to age at
first birth. What then do higher PPR’s for
early menarcheal women, in comparison
with those of later maturers, suggest in
view of the age-at-menarche differential
fecundity hypothesis? Do they suggest
enduring biological differences between
early and late maturers? To answer these
questions, a little detour might be required.

Early puberty women marry and also
initiate childbearing much earlier in comparison with late maturers (Udry and Cliquet, 1982; Otor, 1995). This process
means that at any point of time in the
woman’s reproductive life, early maturers
would tend to have higher numbers of
children born to them, or in other words,
higher parity. Srinivasan (1967) has noted
that parity is primarily the resultant product of two fertility determinants, the fecundability and parity-progression ratios.
He argues that the parity of the married
woman at any point of time in her reproductive life can be considered as the cumulative effect of the fecundability and
parity-progression ratio of the woman in
the past. The fecundability of early maturers, we have already seen, has its roots
in the sexual motivation which, in turn, is
attributed to hormonally-based changes
in puberty. In short, early menarcheal
women have higher PPR’s compared to
their counterparts because they tend to be

258

highly motivated sexually, and also because they initiate childbearing much earlier. So far, we do not find any evidence
of their “biological reproductive superiority” over late puberty women.

Given the differences in findings for different countries in the earlier related studies,
it is more appropriate for us to point out that
findings for Sudan need not hold for other
countries. Further, in fairness, Udry and Cliquet did not actually study differences in
birth intervals by age at menarche as Ryder
and Westoff did. Thus our results should be
evaluated in contrast to Ryder and Westoff’s

Otor and Pandey

Social Biology

rather than those of Udry and Cliquet. Further, neither of these coauthors have employed parity progression ratios. We should
mention at once therefore that our examination of the age-at-menarche differential fecundity hypothesis is more of an extension
on these studies than a critique.
