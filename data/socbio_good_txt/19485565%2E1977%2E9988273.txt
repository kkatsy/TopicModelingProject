ABSTRACT: This paper reports on the decision-making process leading to the choice of a particular
contraceptive method. Specifically, a model was developed and tested which determines the
choice between the IUD and the pill using data obtained from the 1969 Profamilia family
planning program adopter’s questionnaires in Bogota, Colombia. A linear probability model was
employed to estimate the effects of the independent variables on the probability of adopting the
IUD over the pill. Briefly, income, education, parity level, and age were found to be significant
while a spacing/limiting variable was not significant.

In matters concerning family size, a
family unit may be said to be confronted
with from one to three basic decisions.
First, the family must decide whether or
not to space and/or limit children.
Secondly, if it decides to space and/or
limit, the family must then decide what
method will be employed to achieve this
end. Finally, the family must decide, ona
periodic basis, whether or not it will continue with the method chosen.

The purpose of this paper is to report on
research which focuses on the decision regarding which method or combination of
methods will be employed by the family
unit in its attempt to effectively constrain
fertility outcomes to desired levels and
birth intervals. Specifically, when a family
decides to plan its fertility, it is confronted
with a number of possible methods, including the IUD, oral pill, rhythm, withdrawal, condoms, foams, diaphragms,
douche, jelly, sterilization, injections, etc.
Thus, there are a number of methods from
which to choose, and different families
will, if unconstrained, choose among these
methods. The relevant question is: What

criteria go into the process of deciding
which method to use? Certainly, physiological considerations may limit certain
individuals to particular methods. For example, young nonparous women may not
be able to tolerate an IUD (Medawar and
Pyke, 1971). However, there does appear
to be a decision-making process in this
regard over and above the effect of physiological constraints. In this paper we focus
on this contraceptive choice, using data
from Bogota, Colombia.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH

There has been little previous work
done in the area of modeling of contraceptive choice, even though such eminent
demographers as Berelson and Campbell
(1971) have noted the desirability of such
work, There have been some studies of the
characteristics of users of various methods; but these works concentrated on the
broad characteristics of adopters of various methods and little attempt was made
to develop a theory of contraceptive choice
(see, for example, Freedman et al., 1959;

135

136

Whelpton et al., 1966; Ryder and Westoff,
1971; Rainwater, 1965).

Beyond these descriptive studies, a few
attempts have been made to study a behavioral relationship in contraceptive
choice, including studies by Cochrane
(1975), Bauman and Varavej (1972), and
Ballweg (1972). Cochrane employed a
multivariate discriminant analysis in an
attempt to analyze the characteristics
which maximize the prediction of a
woman as an IUD versus pill user. The
sample was composed of 450 OEOsponsored Planned Parenthood clinic participants in Columbia, South Carolina,
including 130 IUD acceptors and 292 pill
acceptors. Briefly, it was found that race,
previous type of contraceptive used, and
number of children lost were the most
significant variables. Cochrane also found
that income and education were not important variables. This latter finding perhaps resulted from the nature of the
sample.

The study by Bauman and Varavej
(1972) examined the choice between the
IUD and the pill and the implications of
the nature of this choice on continuation
rates. Their sample consisted of 5,669
women who had adopted either the pill or
the IUD in a hospital in Bangkok and 179
women from Soongnern Clinic in northeastern Thailand. Their central hypothesis
was that spacers would choose the pill and
limiters the IUD and that this process
tends to artificially lower the continuation
rate for the pill. Their actual data analysis
was limited, including simple two-way
contingency tables and resulting § chisquare statistics. However, their hypothesis was supported by their tests in each of
the two samples. Of central interest here,
though, is not the results of their data
analysis but rather their underlying thesis
that women do not randomly choose
among available contraceptive methods
but rather base choice on “selected vari

ables” and that the process of this choice
has implications for continuation rates.
Ballweg (1972) studied 3,445 national
family planning program subjects in the
Philippines who had adopted the pill,
IUD, rhythm, or other method. Basically,
this study was an attempt to examine
sources of information on family planning,
status, education of the wife, husband’s
occupation, actual fertility, and desired
fertility as they affect contraceptive
method choice. Ballweg found that
women near the end of childbearing years
were more likely to select one of the more
effective methods as also were women
with large families who desire no more
children. In addition, two measures of
status, education and occupation of the
husband, failed to reveal significant
relationships with choice of method.
Simple analysis of variance was used to
test the hypotheses, although it appears
that a more powerful statistical procedure
would have been preferable in this case.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

MODEL SPECIFICATION

Contraception can be thought of as a
consumer good with both quantitative and
qualitative dimensions. Further, there are
two dimensions to the qualitative nature
of contraceptives. First, there is an effectiveness dimension. Even assuming all
methods are used with maximum efficiency, different methods will still yield
different levels of protection from
conception. Second, there is a demand
dimension. Budgets and tastes are not
constant among different individuals. In
order to minimize complications posed by
the first of these two dimensions (differences in effectiveness), this study focuses
on the choice between the IUD and the
oral pill, since both of these methods have
high effectiveness ratings.

It should be emphasized that it is possi

ble to specify a demand function even
where the dependent variable is the choice
of one method over another rather than
more or less of one good. In the case of
such a dichotomous dependent variable,
however, the estimate of the dependent
variable is expressed in terms of the probability of selecting one option over another
(see for example, Goldberger, 1964, p.
249; de Janosi, 1956).

Generally, four determinants of individual demand for contraceptive method
choice can be listed. First, is the price of
the commodity. While in most markets
this is an important determinant of demand, in this study neither the price of the
pill nor the price of the IUD changed over
the period in which the interviews were
conducted. However, this is not to say
that the prices do not have an effect. We
hypothesize that the relationship between
the two prices determines the intercept
constant and that this constant reflects the
exchange ratio between the two methods
in terms of their respective costs (prices) in
the first year of use.

Let x1 = proportion adopting the pill;
x2 = proportion adopting the IUD; »p
= price of the pill; and i = price of the
IUD. By definition, x1 + x2 = 1.0 and
x1 = 1.0 — x2.

In exchange equilibrium, holding all
other effects constant,

 

xl i
x2 po
So,
x1 = 42
ca p
Substituting,
1 = - x2 + 22.
Thus,
i
{= (=) + 1 x2.
Gb

Therefore, x2 = 1/[1 + (i/p)], is the expected intercept value.

This formulation assumes that all other
effects are held constant and that ex

change equilibrium is actually attained.
Further, as the prices of the IUD and the
pill were constant during the period under
examination, the computation of price
elasticity is impossible. Clearly, analysis of
variable prices would be superior to this
fixed type of specification. However, due
to the nature of the data utilized in this
research, this type of analysis was impossible.

After the initial registration in the program, the only cost to the individual using
the IUD was a revisit fee of 5 pesos per
visit. Since the IUD users average 2.5 visits per year, the average cost of maintenance of the IUD was 12.5 pesos per year.
For the pill users, however, each month’s
supply cost 6 pesos, and these users averaged one revisit per year, giving a total
average yearly cost of 77 pesos (Kahley,
1972). Employing the first-year cost as the
effective prices, the exchange formula may
be calculated as follows:

x1 = 1/1 + (12.5/77.)] = 0.86.

Therefore, 0.86 is the hypothesized intercept constant.

The second determinant of demand is
the budget constraint, measured by
monthly income. We hypothesize that a
family with a large income will be more
able to afford the higher cost method than
will a family with a relatively low income.
Thus, the probability of adopting the [UD
should fall as income increases. The relevant measure in this case is expected or
permanent income rather than current
income, since contraception is consumed
over time with recurring costs (Friedman,
1957). Current measured income can be
thought of as including a permanent
component and a transitory component.
The permanent component is determined
by characteristics such as age, education,
and occupation of the husband and the
labor-force participation of the wife.

To derive permanent income, the in

138

strumental variable technique is appropriate (for a discussion of this technique,
see Dutta, 1975). This technique involves
estimating a regression equation where
measured income is the dependent variable and the relevant characteristics are
the independent variable. The results obtained will yield for each observation an
estimated value for income (Y) which can
be taken as the estimate of permanent or
expected income.

The third class of determinants of demand may be called “setting variables.”
These vanables can be subdivided as follows: (1) social status identification; (2)
information availability; and (3) family
life-cycle situation. It is well established
that individuals tend to identify with the
values of those in their social peer group.
In reference to the distinction between the
IUD and the pill, many Latin Americans
feel that the pill is viewed as less objectionable to the church than is the IUD,
since the [UD is thought of as an abortifacient, while the case against the pill is less
clear on this issue (Grisez, 1970, p. 109).
However, as the sample is effectively
monoreligious, a less direct variable than
simply “religion” was necessary. Thus,
since higher status or more highly
educated women in Latin America tend to
be more sensitive to the church viewpoint
than are their less educated counterparts
(Zatuchni, 1970, p. 226), itis hypothesized
that the psychic cost of using the IUD
should increase as wife’s education rises.

It is also clear that the information
available to a woman affects her choice.
While all women receive the same
information on the various methods at the
clinic, there is a differential in the
information received prior to the original
visit to the clinic. This information may
include problems and complications encountered previously by other women.
Complications caused by the IUD are
more obvious and immediate than those

caused by the pill. Hence we expect that as
chances for receiving preclinic contraceptive information increase, as measured by
wife’s education, the probability of choosing the IUD decreases.

Family life-cycle variables influence
choice by affecting the purpose that the
contraceptive must perform. On the one
hand, those women whose main purpose
for using a contraceptive is to space
childbirth will probably opt for a method
that is reversible. On the other hand, those
whose main objective is to prevent births
will choose that method which is the least
trouble to use, the least expensive, and
offers the greatest sustained protection. In
general, the pill is more expensive and
more trouble to use but is perceived as
being more easily reversible than the IUD
(Zatuchni, 1970, p. 16). We thus expect
that spacers will choose the pill and limiters will choose the IUD.

Another aspect of the life-cycle variables is the proportional effect of high fertility which at a younger age may be
stronger than high fertility among older
women due to the effect of what may be
called a “family crisis” situation resulting
from successive pregnancies at a younger
age. The effect may also result from the
positive cohort effect on fertility. Assuming that older cohorts demand larger
numbers of children, we posit that a
“crisis” may more likely occur at a lower
parity level among younger women as
compared to older women. Since we argue
that there is an interaction between wife’s
age and fertility, we include age, fertility,
and a product term of age and fertility to
estimate the strength of the effect.

Finally, in addition to the determinants
of demand just discussed, certain other
variables almost certainly exert influences
upon contraceptive choice, including especially the physiological complications
which prevent some women from adopting one of the methods. While it would be

Vol. 24, No. 2

clearly beneficial to include this type of
effect as a vanable, data limitations
precluded their inclusion. However, in an
attempt to control for this effect as much
as possible, childless women were omitted
from the sample.

DATA

The data used in the present study were
obtained from the 1969 Profamilia family
planning adopters’ questionnaire in Colombia. In an attempt to control for possible differences in relative prices across
space and other possible rural-urban differences, only those observations from
three clinics in Bogota were selected, so
that al] observations used in this study are
urban. Additionally, a number of observations from these clinics were dropped
due to mispunches, nonresponses, and illegitimate codes. After all such eliminations, 4,239 observations remained. Of
these, 3,880 adopted the IUD while 359
adopted the pill.

There are several advantages of using
this sample to estimate the model
specified. First, race and religion, in
addition to the already mentioned location
of residence are not variables in the particular sample, as Colombia in general,
and Bogota specifically, are basically
monoreligious and monoracial so that
these characteristics are not variable.
Second, income is distributed over a large
enough range that a valid analysis can be
performed using this variable. However,
there was a problem with using income as
a variable. The third advantage is that the
questionnaire appears to have been well
administered, and the quality of data is
reasonably good. Fourth, and most important, the “clinic” and “physician” effects
noted earlier have been minimized by including only those clinics characterized by
relatively free client choice in their operation (as opposed, for example, to post

least squares (OLS) violates the assumption of constant variance (homoskedasticity). We therefore employ a two-stage procedure in which the model is first estimated using OLS, thus obtaining estimated values of the dependent variable. A
weight is then calculated based on the estimated values of the dependent variable
which is used multiplicably to transform
all of the variables included in the original
model as described by Goldberger (Goldberger, 1964) p. 249; see also McGillivary,
OID) Tr the carand ctoaa the noramntars
were recalculated based on _ the
transformed variables which yielded generalized least squares (GLS) estimates for
the parameters and corrected for the
heteroskedasticity problem.

Other methods of estimation are possible for this type of problem, none of which
are without problems. The method used
here can only be relied upon asymptotically. That is, the results would not be
reliable for small samples though it is generally reliable for large sample cases such
as this one (Nerlove and Press, 1975, pp.
50-55). Furthermore, the multiple R* and
the subsequent Snedecor F-test have no
meaning in this case (Nerlove and Press,
1975, p. 54). However, the multiple R? ~
resulting from OLS estimation in the presence of heteroskedasticity also has no
meaning (Hu, 1971). Thus, these summary statistics from regression are not
reported so as to avoid confusion.

Table 3 presents the estimated equation
for the model, after estimating permanent
income (the instrument variable mentioned earlier) and after correcting for the
problem of heteroskedasticity. The results
of the estimation of the instrumental variable, income, are:

Table 3 also shows the results from the
first-stage, or uncorrected, model. The estimated equations are essentially the same,
with only a slight change in coefficient
values. It is also seen in Table 3 that all of
the variables display the expected signs,
and alj but one are significant at the 5 per
cent level, two-tailed test. In terms of relative importance, the standardized regression coefficients indicate that the interaction variables (number of living children, wife’s age, and number of children
times wife’s age) are the “best” regressors.

Turning to an interpretation of the
equation, notice the overall predominance
of the IUD as reflected in the high values
for the constant term. The other coefficients, such as that attaching to W
Ed, are interpreted as follows: A woman
who has completed secondary school has a
5 per cent greater probability of choosing
the pill over the IUD as compared to an
illiterate, holding all else constant (found
by multiplying 4, which is equivalent to a
secondary school graduate, by _ the
coefficient on wife’s education).

Income is also a significant explanatory

variable for choice. However, it should be
noted that the coefficient is rather small.
In the case of this variable, increasing
income from 500 pesos to 1,000 pesos will
decrease the probability of opting for the
IUD, as opposed to the pill, by 3.0 per
cent.

Concerning the intercept constant, it
was hypothesized that this coefficient
should equal 0.86, whereas the results
yield an intercept of 0.8205 with a standard error of 0.0408. To determine
whether or not the hypothesis is supported
by the results, a Student-t statistic can be
calculated as follows:

_ 0.86 — 0.8205

0.0408 = 0,968.

This value is not significant at the 20 per
cent level; therefore, the null hypothesis
that the estimated constant is effectively
the same as the hypothesized constant
cannot be rejected. Rephrasing this in a
positive manner, the results support the
hypothesis that the intercept constant is
basically determined by the relative
prices.

To examine the effect of the important
interaction variables more closely, a table
was constructed of the expected probabilities of choosing the IUD, holding all
other variables constant at their means,
and allowing wife’ age and number of

living children to vary over a relevant

range of values. Referring to Table 4, observe that as wife’s age and number of
children increase, the probability of choosing the IUD increases, as expected. In
addition, the proportional increase in the
probability of opting for the IUD for
younger women as number of children is
increased is greater than it is for older
women, indicating a crisis orientation for
younger women with three or more children. That is, they are highly motivated to
reduce fertility and the IUD is perceived
as the best means to accomplish this end.

Finally, note that while the sign of the
coefficient attaching to the  limiting/
spacing variable is consistent with our hypothesis, the estimated partial effect of
this variable turns out to be not significantly different from no effect at all.
This finding may be attributed to multicollinearity or to a lack of systematic
relationship between this variable and
type of method chosen.

CONCLUSION

This study has had the aim of examining the choice process between only two
contraceptive techniques in a restricted
environment. From the results it appears
that people make decisions concerning
which contraceptive technique to adopt at
least partially on the basis of income,
status-determined values, information,
and relevant life-cycle characteristics of

the adopter. The relationship between the
prices of the two methods also appears to
have an influence. This influence of the
relationship between the prices of the
methods suggests that the relative prices
are a policy variable which family planning clinics may employ if they wish to
change the proportions of people adopting
the various methods, though a strong
conclusion on this point should await an
experiment of such a change.

In terms of usefulness, a model of this
type may be employed by family planning
clinics as an aid to channeling potential
adopters into the methods they might
adopt. In addition, this type of analysis
may be useful as a basis for marketing
strategies for contraceptives. Before implementation for such uses, however, the
analysis should be expanded to include
more types of contraceptives and should
be tested on additional samples.
