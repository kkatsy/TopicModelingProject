Factors Affecting the Choice of Nonpermanent
Contraceptive Methods Among Married Women

ABSTRACT: Data from the 1976 National Survey of Family Growth were used to examine the
effect of sociodemographic factors on choice of nonpermanent contraceptive methods among
white, fecund, married women aged 15-44 who intend no additional births. A multivariate analysis revealed that age of the respondent had a strong negative relationship to the effectiveness of
contraceptive chosen. Being Catholic had a negative effect on the effectiveness of contraceptive
chosen. Parity and education alone had an insignificant effect on the effectiveness of contraceptive method chosen, but significant interaction occurred between age and parity and between
age and education. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed.

Choice of contraceptive method and
correctness of method use are major factors affecting the likelihood of an unwanted birth among fecund married
women. Previous analysis of data from
the 1976 National Survey of Family
Growth indicates that 12 per cent of all
births occurring to mothers 15—44 years
of age were unwanted, with a much
higher percentage unwanted among
blacks than whites, 25.8 per cent and 9.8
per cent, respectively (DHEW, 1980).
The choice of ineffective contraceptive
methods or ineffective use of effective
methods undoubtedly contributes to the
occurrence of the admitted as well as unadmitted unwanted births. To help parents prevent unwanted births and to obviate their social and _ health
consequences, it would be desirable to
understand the factors affecting the
choice of contraceptive method.

The factors influencing contraceptive
behavior (and hence method choice)
can be classified in terms of characteristics of the method, of the user, and of
the context (Miller, 1979). An important characteristic of the method is
whether or not it is coitus independent

or coitus dependent (Vaugh et al.,
1981). Coitus-independent methods do
not require a coitus-related action to be
taken at the time of use and include the
nonpermanent methods of the pill and
IUD or the permanent method of sterilization (male or female). Such methods
are relatively new and require the users
to make a long-term commitment compared with coitus-dependent methods.

Among characteristics of the user
that can influence contraceptive behavior are: motivation to avoid additional
births (Jones et al., 1980), the individual’s attitude toward sexuality (Miller,
1979; Rainwater, 1960), future orientation (Oskamp et al., 1978) and perceived efficacy of contraceptive behavior (Luker, 1975).

These characteristics of the user can
be modified by a number of contextual
or background characteristics. Perceived risk of an unwanted pregnancy
seems to wane due perhaps to reduced
coital frequency or perceived reduction
in fecundity as evidenced by the negative association between age of wife and years since first marriage with the effectiveness of contraceptive method cho

sen (Mosher, 1982). Education has been
found to have a positive association with
the effectiveness of method chosen (Ryder and Westoff, 1971). In the 1960’s,
religion influenced the choice of contraceptive method (Westoff, 1973), but the
difference between Catholics and nonCatholics in the percentage using coitusindependent methods narrowed sharply
between 1965 and 1975 (Westoff and
Jones, 1977). In 1965 about 10 per cent
fewer white married Catholic women
less than age 45 were users of nonpermanent coitus-independent methods
than white non-Catholic women less
than age 45, but by 1975 the difference
was only 2 per cent. An effect of income
on the use of coitus-independent contraceptive methods by women aged 15-44
was not observed in the 1973 and 1976
National Survey of Family Growth. In
both surveys the percentage using coitus
independent methods was about 31 per
cent among women with family incomes
of less than 150 percent and greater than
or equal to 150 per cent of poverty
(Ford, 1978).

A few studies have examined the factors influencing the choice of contraceptive methods. A recent report (Mosher,
1982) examined trends in use of contraceptive methods by major sociodemographic factors. Studies in this regard
have been more descriptive than analytic. The specific purpose of this study is
to examine, using a multivariate analysis, the effects of five predictor variables
(age, total family income, religion, education, parity, and length of time since
first marriage) on the choice of nonpermanent contraception chosen among
white, married, fecund women who intend no additional births. The study
sample was selected to control, to the
extent possible, for motivation to avoid
additional births (assumed uniformly

high) and for risk of pregnancy (all are
fecund).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data were obtained from the 1976
National Survey of Family Growth
which was conducted under the auspices
of the National Center for Health Statistics. Women were eligible for inclusion
in the survey if they were currently or
previously married or if they were never
married but had children of their own
living with them in the household. The
number interviewed for the final sample
was 8,611 women 15~44 years old, of
whom 6,482 were currently married.
Data were used adjusting for selection
probability inherent in the sample design and for nonresponse. Further details on the sampling used are provided
by Grady (1979). The sampling design
was a five-stage probability sample
which included oversampling for blacks.
Sample weights were used in our anaiysis but the weighting factor was deflated
by dividing the weight for each case by
the average weight in order to avoid undue power of significance tests. Since
the identification of sampling units and
strata in the sample design was suppressed from the public-use data tape, it
was not possible to incorporate “design
effects” in our analysis. Therefore, it is
likely that the reported significance level
is slightly exaggerated. The total number of cases selected for this study was
1,553 fecund married women who intend no additional births (128 black and
1,425 white), excluding women who reported having been sterilized or whose
husbands have been sterilized. Due to
the small number, black respondents
were dropped from descriptive and multivariate analyses.

To further explore the relative imDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

portance of predictors on contraceptive
method choice and to determine the
best cutting points categorization, an
Automatic Interaction Detector (AID)
analysis was used (Sonquist and Morgan, 1963). The AID analysis splits the
study sample into two groups based on
the predictor which accounts for more of
the variance in the response variable
than any other predictors. After an initial split, each of these groups are considered in turn, and an attempt made to
split based on the predictor which explains most of the variance within each
group. This process continues until no
predictors meaningfully split any of the
subgroups.

The statistical technique used for the
discrete multivariate analysis is a
weighted squares analysis approach
(Grizzle et al., 1969; Forthofer and Lehen, 1981). The relative effectiveness of
each woman’s chosen contraceptive is
used as the response variable and is regressed linearly on the categorical predictors: age of the respondent, education of the respondent, parity, length of
time since first marriage and religion
(Catholic or non-Catholic). In seeking
an appropriate parsimonious model that
fits the data we began with hypotheses
of first-order interactions between: (1)
age and education by respondent and
(2) age and parity of respondent.

Effectiveness of contraceptive
method chosen was weighted for each
contraceptive category by calculating
the mean use effectiveness ratings for
methods in each category based on effectiveness ratings presented by
Hatcher and Stewart (1980). Using
these average effectiveness ratings,
weights were assigned to each category
resulting in a weight of 8 for the pill and
IUD category, 5 for the condom, foam,

or diaphragm, and 1 for the rhythm,
withdrawal, or nonuse category.

To perform the multivariate analysis
a computer program for the Generalized Chi-square Analysis of Categorical
data (GENCAT) was used. Using an
approach suggested by Forthofer and
Lehen (1981), we weighted each category of contraceptive method based on
its average use effectiveness. A best
fitting model was identified which included the terms representing each of
the variables entered and interactions
between them. A model which would
attain a p-value of 0.25 or greater was
sought, but with the available variables
the best fitting model had a p-value of
0.15. Contrast matrices were used to
identify the effect of each variable used
in the model on the effectiveness of
method chosen.

RESULTS

Descriptive analyses were prepared
showing the bivariate relationship between each of the predictors and choice
of contraceptive method for Catholic
and non-Catholic white women. As
shown in Table 1, the differences between method chosen is marked between age categories with about twothirds of white Catholic women aged
18-29 years versus about one-third of
white Catholic women aged 30-44 years
using the pill or IUD. A higher percentage of non-Catholic women aged 30-44
and aged 18~29 use the pill or IUD than
Catholic women, 10 per cent and 6 per
cent, respectively. The percentage of
white Catholic women in the method
categories barrier/chemical or natural/
nonuse is correspondingly higher than
for white non-Catholic women in the
younger age group by about 4 and 2 per

cent, respectively. In the older age
group the only major difference is that
the percentage in the natural/nonuse
category is about 10 per cent higher
among Catholic women. The negative
association between age and effectiveness of method chosen is statistically
significant within both categories of religion.

The differences in the percentage using the pill or LUD between income categories are negligible for both religious
categories. The percentage using
barrier/chemical methods is slightly
higher among women whose total family income is $15,000 or more. The percentage in the natural/nonuse category
of method choice is slightly lower among
those women whose total family income
is $15,000 or more. The relationship between method chosen and income is not
significant for either category of religion.

Only among Catholics does the level
of wife’s education show a significant association with method choice. The percentage using the pill or IUD is about 7
per cent higher among Catholic women
with 12 years of education than among
those with less than 12 years of education. The use of barrier/chemical methods is substantially higher among Catholic women with 13 or more years of
education than other education categories. The percentage in the natural/
nonuse category is about twice as large
among Catholic women with less than
12 years of education than Catholic
women with 13 or more years of education. Correspondingly, the percentage
in the natural/nonuse category is about 6
per cent higher among non-Catholic
women with less than 12 years of education than those with 13 or more years of
education. The differences in use of the

MacDowell and Lee

 

Social Biology

pill or IUD between education categories were negligible among non-Catholic
women.

Length of time since first marriage
had a highly significant relationship with
choice of method. Among both Catholic
and non-Catholic women the percentage using the pill or IUD is much less (30
and 20 per cent, respectively) among
women first married 10 or more years
ago than among women whose first marriage was 5 thru 9 years ago. Among
Catholic women the percentage using
the pill or IUD is about 20 per cent
lower for those women first married 5
through 9 years ago than women first
married less than five years ago. For
both religious categories, as time since
first marriage increases, the percentage
using barrier or chemical methods increases. The percentage in the natural/
nonuse category is about twice as high
among Catholic women first married 10
or more years than those first married
less than 5 years ago.

Parity shows an inverse relationship
with use of the pill or IUD, especially
among Catholic women. A positive relationship between barrier or chemical
methods and parity is also observed.
Among both Catholic and non-Catholic
women the percentage in the natural/
nonuse category is about twice as high
among women with parity of 4 or more
than among women with parity 1 or 0.
The relationship between parity and
method choice is significant for both religious categories.

The AID analysis (Figure 1) indicates
that age is the variable of greatest importance in splitting the study sample
(Group 1) into two groups (Group 2,
ages under 32; and Group 3, ages 32 and
over) and accounts for more of the variance in the effectiveness of contracepDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

tive method chosen than any other predictor. The younger age group (Group
2) exhibits a higher effectiveness score
than the older group (Group 3). The
predictor entered to split Group 2 is parity, and age is the best predictor for splitting Group 3.

Three other predictors were found to
be important in further splitting of the
younger age group (Group 2) in addition to parity: education, religion, and
time since first marriage. Among
women under age 32 with parity less
than 2, education Jevel is an important
predictor of contraceptive effectiveness
and those with less than 15 years of education showed the highest effectiveness
level of any group identified in the AID
analysis. Among women under age 32
with parity of 2 or more, religion and
time since first marriage are important
predictors. Catholic women married
seven years or more with parity 2 or
more have the lowest contraceptive effectiveness value among women under
age 32.

Among women aged 32 or more
(Group 3) an additional split was observed into groups less than age 36 and
greater than or equal to age 36. Among
women aged 36 or more, income is the
most important predictor of contraceptive effectiveness. Those with higher income ($15,000 or more) showed a
greater value for contraceptive effectiveness level. Among women aged 36
or over in families of income $15,000 or
more, religion and parity are important
predictors of contraceptive effectiveness. The Catholic women of this group
with parity less than four showed the
lowest effectiveness of any subgroup
identified in the AID analysis.

The splits identified through AID
analysis were a major factor used in determining the categorization to use in

MacDowell and Lee

TT

Social Biology

later stages of analyses. The use of AID
analysis reduced the likelihood that important divisions for categorization
were omitted.

The result of multivariate analysis is
shown in Table 2. Family income was
deleted from multivariate analysis due
to the multicollinearity between family
income and women’s education and because cross-tabulation indicated education had a stronger association with
method chosen. Because of the small
number of cases with parity of 4 or
more, parity was grouped into two categories: those women with parity 2 or less
and those with parity 3 or more. Time
since first marriage was deleted from
multivariate analysis because of multicollinearity with age of respondent.

The results obtained from a multivariate analysis are consistent with those
found in descriptive and AID analyses.
An inverse relationship is observed between age and effectiveness of contraception used. The magnitude of the
model parameter for ages 13-30 shows
the highest positive influence on effectiveness of contraceptive method used.
A weaker positive influence for ages 3134 is observed. Being aged 35-44 has a
negative effect on method effectiveness.
When other variables are controlled,
parity does not show a significant influence on method effectiveness chosen.
Being Catholic has a moderately strong
negative influence on the effectiveness
of contraception chosen. Education
level of wife has no significant influence
on the effectiveness of contraceptive
method chosen. To summarize, the
highest level of contraceptive effectiveness would be expected among women
ages 18-30 with parity less than 3 who
are non-Catholic and have education
less than 13 years.

DISCUSSION

The findings from the study are generally in conformity with the relationships that would be expected between
study variables and the effectiveness of
contraceptive method chosen. Several
explanations could account for the
strong negative relationship between
age and effectiveness of contraceptive
method chosen among fecund white
women intending no additional births.
One explanation may be that increased
age may result in reduced perception of
risk that an unwanted birth will occur.
Another explanation is that concerns
about health risks associated with the
pill or IUD use may lead to use of other
methods among older women. However, this explanation is tenuous since

the percentages of IUD and pill users
declined slightly between 1973 and 1976
in both the 15-29 year and 30-44 year
age groups (Mosher, 1982). The most
probably explanation of the observed
relationship is a cohort effect, i.e., older
women who began marital contraception at an earlier point in time have continued to use the same methods as were
initially available early in their marriage. Such a persistence in the choice of
contraceptive method was found by Ryder (1976). Separation of a true chronological age effect from a cohort effect is
not possible using cross-sectional data.
The lack of a significant association
between parity and the effectiveness of
contraceptive method chosen based on
multivariate analysis is most likely due
to the high correlation between parity

230

and age. Although the cross-tabulation
had indicated a significant association,
when the effect of age was controlled the
association between parity and effectiveness of method chosen is no longer
significant.

As was found in descriptive analysis
of the effect of religion, the multivariate
analysis also showed a significant negative relationship between effectiveness
of contraceptive method and being
Catholic. Although Westoff and Jones
(1977) indicated a narrowing of difference in the percentage using the pill or
IUD between white Catholic and nonCatholic had occurred, among women
intending no additional births, religion
still is an important factor influencing
the choice of contraceptive method. The
effect of being Catholic remains strong
when age is controlled. It is possible that
among younger Catholic women who do
intend additional births the influence of
religion on method choice is diminishing
which would explain the difference between the influence of religion observed
from these data and the finding of Westoff and Jones (1977).

The lack of a significant effect of education on choice of method may be explained by the nearly universal access to
all methods of contraception for married women. Before the implementa

tion of federal funding that made family
planning services more accessible to low
income women, it is possible that low
education was associated with higher
use of natural methods or nonuse due to
the high correlation between level of education and family income.

The best fitting model also included
interaction terms for: (1) being aged 18
to 31 with parity; and (2) being aged 18
to 31 with education. The direction of
the coefficients for these interactions
were as would be expected. Younger
women with lower parity were more
likely to have been using methods with
higher effectiveness. The positive interaction coefficient for the interaction
term of age 18 to 31 with education less
than 13 years could be due to less concern or awareness of the health risks of
pill or IUD use and/or less willingness to
use barrier methods among women with
education less than 13 years.

Although inference from crosssectional data analysis is limited, the
findings from this study would be a useful adjunct to our understanding of contraceptive behavior. Repeated studies
along the same line for later time periods would shed additional light on the
understanding of current behavior patterns as well as future trends.
