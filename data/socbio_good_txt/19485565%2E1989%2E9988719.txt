ABSTRACT: This study analyzes fertility determinants in the oil region of Mexico, consisting of
the states of Veracruz, Tabasco, and Campeche. Data are from the 1980 Mexican census and
the unit of analysis is the municipio. The regression models, in which the dependent variables of
children ever born and child-woman ratio are examined, reveal religious variables to be most
significant, with greater fertility for non-Catholics and persons with no religion than for
Catholics. Also of great importance are economic variables. Literacy and urbanization, both
“‘classical’’ Mexican fertility variables, reduce fertility. There are major differences among three
urban/rural and three indigenous language subsamples. Results are discussed vis-a-vis

demographic theories and prior research.

Although Mexican fertility has been
lowered substantially over the past
fifteen years, Mexico still is growing rapidly due to population momentum. One
projection indicates a population of 105
million in the year 2000, a growth increment of about 21 million persons from
present (Population Reference Bureau,
1988). With such a large anticipated increase, fertility control remains a vital
national issue. Another related issue is
that of population distribution. Mexico
is suffering from the effects of maldistribution, especially in relation to overpopulation in the national capital of
Mexico City and its surrounding states.
Hence it is important to improve understanding of regional demographic differences in order to plan for the location of
present and future population. Although the De La Madrid government
during its 1982-88 term adopted a policy of national population decentralization, migration patterns have continued

to favor growth of the capitol’s greater
metropolitan area (Fukurai et al., 1987;
Pick et al., 1989).

The goal of the present research is to
examine variation in and determinants
of fertility in the oil region of Mexico,
consisting of the states of Veracruz, Tabasco, and Campeche. The geographical unit for the study is the municipio.
The municipio is a unit analogous to the
county in the United States and is
defined by the Mexican census as the
base unit of territorial division and
political/administrative organization in
the nation (Secretaria de Programacion
y Presupuesto, 1982-85; see also Pirez,
1981). The region is selected because of
its major economic importance for the
present and future development of
Mexico. The research objectives are: to
analyze and compare basic levels and
differences in fertility to determine the
important predictors of fertility, to compare results to those for the U.S.

Mexico border region, and to discuss the
results in terms of demographic research
and theory.

The present research contributes to
an enhanced knowledge of demographic processes in the oil region of
Mexico. Following discovery of an oil
superfield in the region in the mid 70’s,
the region’s economic output and importance have increased. In 1986, this
region accounted for 95 per cent of Mexico’s 913 million barrels of crude oil production, and 77 per cent of its 35.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas
production (Pemex, 1986). Oil reserves
are also largely concentrated in this region. The economic significance of these
reserves in Mexico’s future is shown by
national proven crude oil reserves at the
end of 1986 of 54.9 billion barrels, an
amount estimated at 46 per cent of the
Western Hemisphere’s and 8 per cent of
the world’s proven oil reserves (Pemex,
1986).

Prior to the oil discovery, the region
was characterized by an agricultural orientation and average population
growth. From 1930 to 1980, the region
grew in population from 1.7 million to
6.9 million, at rates approximating the
nation. Since the oil discovery, the region has experienced diverse population
and economic effects. First, the oil industry has caused a shift in economic
growth and production from the region’s largest city of Veracruz to other
Cities, especially Tampico, Poza Rica,
Coatzacoalcos, Villahermosa, and Ciudad de Carmen. As a result, the region
has become more urban. For the state of
Tabasco, an indicator of oil-related
growth is the increase in employees in
Pemex, the national oil company, from
just a few employees before 1973 to
18,400 (7,000 permanent and 11,440
temporary) employees in 1979 (Ne
Social Biology

grete, 1984). Nevertheless, oil industry
decision-making and power largely has
remained in Mexico City. The oil boom
has in many ways destroyed local traditions and culture in cities affected by it,
although Veracruz has managed to
maintain much of its traditional culture
(Riding, 1985).

In summary, since the mid 70’s, the
oil region has experienced an economic
and demographic transformation. From
a somewhat sleepy, agriculturally-oriented region, it has become one of potentially great economic strength and
productivity. Data in the present research paper refer to the region about
five years into this transformation.

BACKGROUND
MEXICAN FERTILITY

The present study adds to a substantial knowledge base on Mexican fertility. Several studies have summarized
the existing knowledge on the country’s
fertility (Rubin-Kurtzman, 1987; Martinez, 1982). These summaries reveal
many types of models constructed to examine the relationships and determinants of Mexico’s fertility. These
models include geographically-based
statistical studies, psychosocial analyses, medically-based studies of biological aspects of fertility, and others. This
section concentrates on the first category of studies. It is perhaps premature
to present a uniform theory to account
for the dynamics of Mexican fertility.
Therefore, it is more worthwhile to review here four key determinants, which
have been emphasized in the body of
Mexican fertility research: urban-rural
differences, education/literacy, economic activity, and migration. All have
been studied often in the past, and for
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

Vol. 36, No. 1-2

some, a clear consensus of findings has
occurred. Other determinants, not discussed, include family size attitudes,
standard of living, legal versus consensual marriage, and indigenous background. Religion, an under-studied determinant, is mentioned at the end of
the section.

Urban-rural residence is a determinant of great importance in prior Mexican studies. Theoretically, much work
has been accomplished in such studies,
drawing on a larger body of research on
developing nations (Rubin-Kurtzman,
1987). The inverse relationship between
urban residence and fertility has sometimes been ascribed to a dualistic focus.
In rural areas, children are needed to
preserve the family unit both due to direct economic contributions and to
other influences including strengthening
of social bonds, provision of insurance
against the ravages of infant mortality,
and giving care to family elders. In urban areas, children usually represent
more of an economic burden than asset
(Kasarda et al., 1986), and they are valued less. At the same time, infant mortality is lower, and more government
care for the elderly is available.

Empirical studies have repeatedly
affirmed urbanization as perhaps the
strongest of all fertility determinants in
Mexico. Geographically-based studies,
utilizing a variety of data sources from a
fifty-year period, have consistently confirmed an inverse relationship (Robinson and Robinson, 1960; Benitez Zenteno, 1962; Coale and Hoover, 1958;
Zarate, 1967; Hicks, 1974; Pillet, 1980;
Pick et al., 1986, 1987a). Although, as
pointed out by Espinosa and Welti
(1983), there is more complexity underlying “urban” and “rural” than is shown
by inclusion of a single variable, usually
the researcher is handicapped by availa
 

Fertility Determinants 47

ble data sources in penetrating the underlying subtleties of urban and rural
distinctions.

Another important determinant is
education, and closely-related is literacy. Studies including education or literacy have consistently noted an inverse
influence on fertility (Hicks, 1974;
Seiver, 1975; Garcia y Garma, 1979;
Zambrano Lupi, 1979; Holian, 1986;
Pick et al., 1986; Pick, Butler, and
Pavgi, 1987a). Theories have been constructed showing that education lowers
fertility through a variety of pathways
(Rubin-Kurtzman, 1987; Kasarda et al.,
1986). These include increase in employment opportunities outside the
household, increase in the cost of childbearing, increase in the age at marriage,
and greater knowledge and utilization of
contraception.

Empirical studies on Mexico have
consistently confirmed the importance
of education/literacy, based on a variety
of methodologies and sample units including the state, municipio, and household. For instance, a study of the borderlands region at the municipio level,
similar in design to the present one,
showed that literacy had a dominating
inverse effect on fertility (Pick et al.,
1986). A different type of study was
based on 1970 household survey data in
Mexico City (Zambrano Lupi, 1979). In
addition to education, this study also examined the effect of the respondent’s social position by dividing respondents
into three social groups: (1) manual laborers earning wages, (2) nonmanual
salaried workers, and (3) nonmanual
professionals and employers. Results
confirmed the major importance of education, with fine differences noted between categories of manual and nonmanual workers.

Economic activity and related em

48 Pick et al.

ployment variables have often been
significant fertility determinants, but
with neither the consistency nor the importance of urbanization and education/
literacy. Also, the female economic activity determinant has been studied toa
preater extent than that of male economic activity. A review of the female
economic activity determinant in Mexican fertility studies (Rubin-Kurtzman,
1987) has classified studies of female economic activity into the following three
types: (1) Studies that focus on the economic activity itself. Here an inverse relationship between female economic activity or employment and fertility has
usually been noted. (2) Studies of a
larger set of female occupational characteristics and fertility (for instance, Hass,
1972). These studies vary to a greater
extent, and fewer inconsistencies were
noted. (3) Studies based on models of
the domestic unit (for example, Garcia
and Oliveira, 1978). These more complicated studies incorporate theoretical
concepts such as the marriage life cycle,
new household economy, and female
role conflict. Studies examining male economic activity or employment have
tended to focus on the perspective of occupation or social mobility (RubinKurtzman, 1987). These studies have
generally not found male economic activity to be a major fertility predictor, although a strong effect from male economic activity was noted for the
Mexican borderlands (Pick et al., 1986,
19875).

Migration has been included in a
number of Mexican fertility studies in
order to examine migration-fertility interactions. Here, the theory is not yet
clear, even in the direction of causation.
In addition, empirical results have
shown a variety of results. For instance,
in a study based on a national fertility

Social Biology

household survey, Espinosa and Welti
(1983) examined correlations between
fertility and migration by region and age
of correspondent. There were no consistent relationships. For instance, regions differed considerably in direction
and strength of the relationship. Other
survey studies have concentrated on the
fertility of residents of large Mexican cities, relative to migratory history, and
have had varying results (for example,
Brito, 1969).

Lastly, it is important to mention religion as a possible fertility determinant,
although it has rarely been included in
Mexican studies. The present researchers were able to locate only one prior
Mexican study which included a religious variable (Davidson, 1973). The
lack of inclusion is surprising given the
frequent importance of religion as a variable in U.S. studies of fertility. The
main reason may be Mexico’s small proportion of non-Catholic population (7.4
per cent in the 1980 census). Davidson’s
study included religiosity as an independent variable in a study of fertility variation among women in the Federal District, Mexico, compared to women in
Caracas, Venezuela. Controlling for education, religiosity of wives revealed no
consistent relationship to fertility for
ever-married women.

THE Municreio As A Unit oF ANALYSIS

The municipio was established in
Mexico by the 1917 Constitution with
the intention of giving more emphasis to
regions and localities (Pirez, 1981).
However, since that time the government in Mexico has increasingly been
concentrated at the federal level, as revealed by the decrease in the municipio’s share of overall governmental income from 5.3 per cent in 1940 to 1.5 per
cent in 1970 (and probably less today).

Vol. 36, No. 1-2

Partly because municipio boundaries
have not been substantially altered since
1917, there is an unequal number of
municipios among the states. For instance, there are 571 municipios in Oaxaca and 222 in Puebla, versus only 4 in
Baja California, 32 in Morelos, and 38 in
Coahuila. Municipios are also characterized by heterogeneity, inequality in
social and economic characteristics, and
variation in geographical size. The distributions of income, literacy, and housing by municipio are unbalanced,
weighted toward the lower end.

Several studies have evaluated the
accuracy of the Mexican censuses of
1970 (Camposortega, 1983) and 1980
(Lopez, 1982), and caution must be exercised in using census data. In spite of
problems, the above studies agree that
the 1970 and 1980 Mexican census data,
on the whole, are acceptable for research purposes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The major objective of this study is to
examine possible important determinants on fertility in the oil region. Selection of the two dependent fertility variables, one cohort and one period, was
limited by the constraints of the Mexican census. The selected variables measure recent fertility, since the Mexican
census does not provide an accurate series of historical cohort data. Also, variables measuring earlier cohort fertility
would not correspond in time to the
1980 independent variables. Because
this study of regional fertility is uncommon in the Mexican literature, the independent variables examined include
those well known in the Mexican and
worldwide literature and others of suspected importance for this research.
This study is empirical in nature. The

Fertility Determinants 49

authors feel it is premature to attempt a
theory of regional fertility causation in
Mexico, a development which should
await a larger body of empirical studies.

The two dependent variables utilized
are as follows:

(1) Children Ever Born, Women
Aged 20-29.—This variable has been
utilized frequently in Mexican fertility
research (Pick et al., 1986, 19875; Holian, 1983, 1986; Garcia y Garma, 1980).
It is defined as the ratio of all live births
for women age 20-29, to the total number of women aged 20~29. The variable
has a disadvantage that census respondents may not have accurately recalled
their fertility histories. In addition,
there is a longer time frame for fertility
than for children ever born, 1.e., the cumulative fertility of the 20-29 age group
took place throughout the 70’s and even
earlier. Earlier fertility and its explanation may not relate at all to 1979-80 fertility. However, results of a prior analysis for the Mexican borderlands (Pick et
al., 1987b) reveals that Mexican fertility
was very stable geographically over a
thirty-year period. Another disadvantage of this variable is that some fertility,
for women who inmigrated, occurred
outside of the oil region. This problem,
however, is common to all of the abovecited studies.

(2) Child-Woman Ratio.—To allow
a comparison and to cross-check the validity of the results, a second fertility
measure is used, child-woman ratio,
defined as the ratio of population age 04, to the female population of childbearing age, 15-49. Seiver (1975) used this
variable for 1970 state data. Seiver adjusted the child-woman ratio for estimated regional variations in underenumeration and infant mortality. These
adjustments are impossible for the present study, since no estimates have ever

been made of the two error factors for
the oil region municipios. The relatively
low estimated undercount for the 1980
Mexican Census, mentioned earlier, is a
favorable factor supporting use of this
variable. This variable has an advantage
over children ever born, women age 2029, in that the fertility must have occurred in the 1975-80 period, and thus
relates better to the 1975-80 independent variables. Inclusion of two dependent variables affords comparison of the
differential effects of independent variables. Effects confirmed by both dependent variables can then be considered
strong.

The following independent variables
were selected:

Literacy.—Literacy is defined as the
ratio of literate population 15 years and
older to population 15 years and older.
Numerous prior studies of Mexican fertility point to the important influence of
education and/or literacy on reducing
fertility (Pick et al., 1986, 1987a, b; Holian, 1983, 1986; Seiver, 1975). Because
of collinearity problems, only literacy
was included in the analysis.! Because of
the low literacy/educational levels in the
oil region, literacy relates to a much
larger proportion of the population than
primary education. Nevertheless, the
two variables are so closely correlated
that results are very similar regardless of
choice.

Indigenous Language.—Indigenous
language is defined as the ratio of population 5 years and older which speaks an
indigenous language to population 5

Primary education was also considered for inclusion as an independent variable. It was defined
as the ratio of population aged 10 years and older
with less than completion of primary education to
the total population aged ten years and older. It
was excluded from the analysis because of possible
collinearity problems resulting from its highly
significant correlation of —0.79 with literacy.

years and older. Persons falling into this
category may Or may not speak Spanish.
This variable has been infrequently used
in Mexican fertility studies. It is included in the present study because of its
significance as reported by Hicks (1974),
the high proportion of indigenous population (21.0 per cent) in the oil region,
and the importance of the indigenous
population to the social and political
structure of the region (Riding, 1985).

Non-Catholic.—This variable is defined as the ratio of persons of Protestant or Evangelist, Jewish, and Other
religion to the entire population. Although inclusion of the entire population may be surprising, the Mexican census does ask for religion for children and
infants (almost always the religion of the
parents). For Mexico as a whole, the
Protestant or Evangelist, Jewish, and
Other categories constitute respectively
3.29, 0.09, and 0.86 per cent of the population. These three categories are included together under Non-Catholic,
merely as a convenient variable label.
All people in this group represent organized religious belief which is nonCatholic; Protestants constitute 78 per
cent of this category. As far as can be determined, this variable has not been included in prior studies of Mexican fertility. It was included because of the past
importance of religion for differential
fertility in the U.S. (Westoff and Ryder,
1977; Dolan and Leege, 1985; Goldscheider, 1967; Mosher and Goldscheider, 1984; Mosher and Hendershot, 1984a, b: Mosher et al., 1986)
and in other countries (Day, 1968, 1983;
Van Heek, 1956; Wright and Davies,
1974).

No Religion.—No religion is defined
as the ratio of population not having religion to the entire population. It does
not necessarily connote aetheism or agDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 36, No. 1-2

nosticism, but rather lack of belief in organized religion. It likely includes a
small portion of believers in native or
syncretist religions, some with tinges of
Catholicism (Riding, 1985). In Mexico,
this category constitutes 3.1 per cent of
the population. It has not been included
in prior studies of Mexican fertility, but
is included here because it is a significant
proportion of the non-Catholic population and is expected to differ substantially in effects from Non-Catholics.

Labor Force Participation: Male and
Female.—Male labor force participation is defined as the ratio of economically active males aged 15-29 to male
population 15-29. Female labor force
participation is similarly defined. This
age category includes those in their
years of highest reproductivity.

Seiver (1975) included labor force
participation, pooled for both sexes, as
an independent variable, but it lacked
significance. Pick et al. (1987b) included
male and female labor force participation as separate independent variables
and noted the expected reduction in fertility by female labor force participation
but, surprisingly, an increase in fertility
from higher levels of male labor force
participation. In the fertility literature
for other nations, female labor force
participation has frequently been included and usually has a significant effect on reducing fertility (Kasarda et al.,
1986). These results, however, are less
consistent when urbanization and type
of employment are taken into account
(see, for example, Mueller and Short,
1983; Standing, 1983; and Repetto,
1979).

Unemployment.—Unemployment is
defined by the following ratio: economically active population, 12 years and
older, working 0 hours per week/
economically active population, 12

Fertility Determinants 34

years and older, excluding those not
specifying hours worked.

This variable has been included in
only a few prior Mexican fertility studies, is unavailable for many surveys, but
is available by calculation in the Mexican census. It was included in a prior
municipio-based study of the U.S.Mexico borderlands (Pick et al., 1987b)
in which it showed a secondary but a
significant effect on reducing fertility.

Nollow Income.—No/low income is
defined by the following ratio: economically active population 12 years and
older, with no income or income of 11970 pesos/month/economically active
population 12 years and older, excluding those not specifying income.

This variable excludes a substantial
proportion of economically active with
income level unspecified. The only previously cited Mexican fertility study containing this variable was by Seiver
(1975), with no significant results. It is
important to note that the 1980 exchange rate for the peso was about 23 to
the U.S. dollar, versus a much higher
rate today.

Urbanization.—Urbanization is
defined as the ratio of persons living in
places of 2,500 population or more to total population. Other studies of Mexican fertility, Seiver (1975), Holian
(1983, 1986), and Pick et al. (1986,
1987b) almost unanimously noted that
urbanization reduced fertility, a finding
in accord with many worldwides studies,
such as the World Fertility Survey (Cleland and Hobcraft, 1985). Oil region
municipios have a large variation in urbanization, and as noted above, urbanization is increasing as a consequence of
the oil boom.

Inmigration, 1979-80.—This variable is defined as the ratio of population
which inmigrated into a municipio or

52 Pick et al.

state in the year preceding the 1980 census to the population of the municipio or
state in 1980. Inmigration has rarely
been included in prior studies of Mexican fertility. Using individual level data
for four regions of Mexico, Pick et al.
(1987a) noted relatively little influence
of migration on fertility. For borderlands municipios, Pick et al. (1987b)
likewise noted little effect of inmigration on fertility. It is included to examine the possible effects on fertility of increased inmigration into the oil region
during 1979-80, much of it associated
with the oil boom.

The data are from the 1980 Mexican
Census of Population (Secretaria de
Programacion y Presupuesto, 1982-85).
The statistical methods utilized are descriptive statistical analysis, correlation,
and regression analysis. The regression

* analysis uses both favored stepping and

backward elimination algorithms. Generally, for less than a full set of variables,
the backward elimination algorithm was
used. Usually the results for forward
and backward stepping were highly
comparable. The sample unit selected is
the municipio. For municipios other
than the largest metropolises and rural
areas, the municipio unit accurately

reflects areal differences since it corresponds generally to the location of a single town or city, and in fact often is
named the same as the town or city
(e.g., Veracruz Municipio contains one
major city, Veracruz). This correspondence, originally established about seventy years ago, remains largely valid. In
rural areas, municipio boundaries often
correspond to geographic features.
However, since the governmental authority, albeit weak for municipios, corresponds to these boundaries, the municipio represents a more coherent smallpopulation aggregate than any other
unit having the necessary data.

The present study interprets the effects of municipio characteristics on
municipio fertility, in order to avoid the
ecological fallacy. While it may be preferable to utilize individual data, no such
data are available on a systematic and
recent basis for the oil region. Even if
available, it is unlikely that a survey
would include the municipio or locality
as a variable (for example the data set
from the World Fertility Survey of
1976-77 does not include a municipio/
locality coding). Most prior studies of
Mexico fertility using census data have
utilized the state as a unit of analysis (for

example, Hicks, 1975; Seiver, 1974).
Only a few census-based studies have
utilized the individual level and only for
1970 (see Holian, 1983, 1986). Such a
sample is not available for 1980.

The samples below were chosen for
analysis:

(a.) All municipios.—The full oilregion universe consists of 228 municipios in the three states.

(b.) High Urbanization.—The sample consists of 42 municipios with urbanization greater than 65.0 per cent. The
purpose of this sample is to access differential fertility in oil-region urbanized
municipios.

(c.) Low Urbanization.—The sample
consists of 111 municipios with urbanization equal to or less than 65.0 per cent
and greater than 0.0 per cent.

(d.) Rural.—The sample consists of
75 municipios with no urbanization, i.e.,
0.0 per cent.

(e.) High Indigenous.—The sample
consists of 42 municipios with per cent
indigenous speakers greater than or
equal to 50.0 per cent. The purpose of
this sample is to access differential fertility across a range of levels of proportion
indigenous.

(f.) Medium Indigenous.—The sam

(g.) Low Indigenous.—The sample
consists of 68 municipios with per cent
indigenous speakers less than 2.0 per

RESULTS

Statistical analysis was performed for
the oil-region universe and the samples
defined above. A summary of descriptive statistics for the major samples is
presented in Table 1. The mean value
for children ever born compares to previous studies; it is 12 per cent higher
than the comparable mean for the border region. On the other hand, childwoman ratio is only 3 per cent higher in
the oil region. This finding may reflect
convergence in fertility between regions, since the child-woman ratio represents, on the average, more recent fertility than does children ever born.
Another reason may be regional differences in infant and child mortality rates,
which are reflected in child-woman ratio, but not in children ever born. In
fact, infant mortality rates for 1979 were

higher in the oil than in the border region (Secretaria de Programacion y Presupuesto, 1981). For children ever born
and child-woman ratio, there are urban
gradients, with the rural sample values
respectively 23.9 and 24.4 per cent
higher than for the urban sample. There
is less variation in fertility among the
three indigenous samples, with variation from the high to low indigenous
samples of 9.2 and 1.3 per cent respectively for the two fertility measures.

For the entire oil-region universe,
mean values for non-Catholic, labor
force, and urbanization conform to
those for the borderlands. However, literacy is notably lower; indigenous language is much higher; no religion is
much higher; unemployment is much
lower; no/low income is much higher;
and the inmigration rate is half the borderlands rate. The economic variables
reflect lower incomes, but caution must
be exercised because the Mexico-U.S.
border economy tends to raise income
levels on the Mexican side.

For many variables there are significant differences in mean values across
the urban/rural and indigenous samples.
One of particular interest is nonCatholic religion, which is higher in the
other urbanization samples (6.9 per
cent) than in the rural sample (4.1 per
cent). It is high in the high and medium
indigenous samples (6.2 and 6.8 per
cent) and low (4.4 per cent) in the low
indigenous sample. Clearly, the nonCatholic religious population ts not synonymous with rural and/or low indigenous areas. No religion shows a
different pattern. In the urban/rural
samples, it is highest in low urbanization
areas, while it decreases consistently in
value from the high to low indigenous
samples. The region’s oil boom may be
reflected in a level of inmigration about

Social Biology

three times as great in the high urbanization versus the rural sample. By contrast
in the border region, inmigration for the
urban sample is only 33 per cent higher.
Other differentials and trends in mean
values and standard deviations are presented in Table 1.

REGRESSION ANALYSIS

The results of the regression analysis,
with all independent variables included,
are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The regression equations were highly significant,
except for the high indigenous sample.
Inclusion of all independent variables
allows complete cross-comparison of
results. However, in four of the samples
(high urbanization, rural, high indigenous, and low indigenous), the ratio of
variables to cases, with the full set of independent variables, was considered by
the authors to be low, 1.e., less than 1-to10. For these four subsamples, further
stepwise regressions were performed, in
order to test the effect of raising the
above ratio to 1-to-10 or more. The forward stepping algorithm was utilized.
The results of the stepwise regressions
are presented in Table 4. There is close
correspondence between the results
with the full set of independent variables
and the stepwise results, in the direction
and significance of variables and in overall adjusted R?. However, for two regression equations, high urbanization/
children ever born and low indigenous/
children ever born, the significant variables selected by stepwise technique is
somewhat different. For these two
equations, the stepwise results will be
referred to in the discussion of results.

For the rural and high indigenous
subsamples, even after the significance
improvements of the stepwise results,
the adjusted R? was low, and in the latter sample insignificant. In these sam

ples, we carried the analysis further by
testing for outlier cases and dropping
cases where the standardized residual
was more than two standard deviations
from the mean residual. This method
has been utilized in related studies (for
example, see London and Smith, 1988).
The results, shown in Table 4, show further improvement in the significance
levels of R?, while retaining for the selected independent variables the same
orderings of significance and directions
of effect, as prior to dropping the cases.
Hence, the outliers do not affect the selection of variables. For these two samples, the stepwise results, after dropping
cases, will be referred to in the discussion of regression results.

Regression Results for Children Ever
Born, Women Age 20-29.—¥For children ever born (women age 20-29), for
the entire oil-region universe, the most
important effects are lower fertility for
higher literacy and increased fertility fer
higher Non-Catholic, no religion, and
no/low income. Results are quite different for the three urban/rural samples.
For high urban, the fertility-raising effect of no religion is very important,
along with labor force effects (positive
for male and negative for female), and
the fertility-lowering effect of literacy.
The strong effect of no religion and lack
of effect for non-Catholics is inversely
related to the proportions, since there is
a low proportion of no religion and a
high proportion of non-Catholics in urban municipios.

For low urban, there are significant
effects in reducing fertility from nonCatholic, no religion, and no/low income, and in increasing fertility from urbanization. Of secondary importance is
a fertility-lowering effect of unemployment, corresponding to a similar,
stronger effect in the urban sample. For

Social Biology

rural, there is significant lowering of fertility from literacy and indigenous language.

For the high indigenous sample, no
religion is associated with higher fertility
and employment with lower fertility.
For the medium indigenous sample, the
results resemble closely those for the
low urbanization sample, with significant literacy, non-Catholic, no/low income, and immigration effects in expected directions. For the low indigenous sample, results were weaker than
for medium indigenous. No/low income
is the most significant influence.

Regression Results for Child-Woman
Ratio.—Regression results are compared for the two fertility measures, referring to the stepwise results for the
smaller N samples (less than 75 cases).
Regression results for child-woman ratio resemble those for children ever
born (see Tables 2, 3, and 4). Thus, only
exceptions to an otherwise close similarity will be mentioned. For the entire oil
region, no religion has no significance, a
Jack of effect which also exists for several other samples. The explanation of
its greater strength generally for children ever born may be the fact that children ever born reflects fertility at an earlier mean time point than child-woman
ratio. This may indicate that religious
differentials in fertility are lessening,
and the effect may be expected to be
weaker at the later time point.

For the entire universe, another difference is the greater importance of
male Jabor force participation in increasing fertility in contrast to most
other results for this variable.

For the high urbanization sample, no
religion again is diminished in importance, while literacy is important only
for children ever born. In the low urbanization sample, no religion is not signi

ficant, but higher indigenous language
significantly reduces fertility.

For the high indigenous sample,
child-woman ratio has different determinants: male labor force participation
(positive) and no/low income (negative). For medium indigenous, both no
religion and urbanization became nonsignificant, while unemployment significantly reduces fertility. For the low indigenous sample, the differences are
that unemployment and female labor
force participation have fertility reducing effects; literacy, non-Catholic religion, and urbanization are not significant.

DISCUSSION

In this section, the effects of specific
variables or sets of variables, are discussed. Results are then compared
across the three urban and three indigenous samples. Finally, fertility determinants are compared between the oil and
border regions. For the rural and high
indigenous samples, the discussion always refers to the additional regressions,

The most surprising results are
greater fertility for non-Catholic and no
religion. These results are quite strong
and consistent across a variety of samples. Overall, for children ever born, no
religion is second in significance and
non-Catholic is third. If the pair of religious variables are regarded as a set,
they are second in importance to economic variables. For the regression
analyses, with a full set of independent
variables, non-Catholic or no religion
are significant in 9 out of 14 regressions,
and both are significant in 2 out of
14 regressions. Likewise, religious variables are significant in half of the
stepwise regressions. There is almost no
previous recognition of religious effects

on fertility in the Mexican population
literature. Davidson’s finding for Mexico City that greater religiosity increased
fertility for a low-educated subsample
has limited application to the present
results. Since non-Catholics are minorities in Mexico, they actually may be
more religious than Catholics or may
suffer from some form of socioeconomic
exploitation.

Three theoretical arguments from
Mosher et al. (1986) are examined for
possible explanation of the religious effects. These are the minority status,
characteristics, and norms arguments.

The minority status argument is that
if, after controlling for socioeconomic
characteristics, a religious group is acculturated, oriented toward upward mobility, and not pronatalist, it will have
lower fertility than the religious majority. On the other hand, if it does not
meet these conditions, it will have
higher fertility than the majority group.
An example of the former is Jewish fertility in the United States (Goldscheider, 1967). The group meets all
three conditions and has maintained
significantly lower fertility than the two
other principal religious groups, Examples of the latter are U.S. Catholics prior
to the 1980’s (Westoff and Ryder, 1977;
Mosher and Hendershot, 1984a, b) and
Catholics in various European nations
(Van Heek, 1956; Day, 1968, 1983;
Wright and Davies, 1974). Although in
the 1970’s minority Catholics had a 24
per cent higher cohort fertility rate than
Protestants, the two groups appear recently to have largely converged (Westoff, 1986; Mosher et al., 1986). One
study indicates that the true model
should reflect reversals in Catholic/
Protestant fertility differentials from
generation to generation (Dolan and
Leege, 1985). Another example is that

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

60 Pick et al.

of Catholics in Northern Ireland, who
have shown elevated fertility compared
to Protestants, which is likely due in part
to minority group response to perceived
oppression by the majority (Wright and
Davies, 1974).

It is difficult to determine whether or
not the minority group conditions are
met by oil-region non-Catholics. It is
more likely that Evangelist denominations do not meet the conditions (and
hence have a positive effect) since they
sometimes have pronatalist ideology
and are less acculturated. Older, more
traditional Protestant denominations
may tend to be neutral on the conditions
and argument. If this argument does
support a positive effect, this effect
likely is amplified by the small percentage of the minority versus other countries. This minority argument is more
difficult to apply to the no-religion cate
" gory.

Another argument hypothesizes that
religious fertility differentials are artifacts of socioeconomic differentials.
This argument is illustrated by a study in
the United States which showed that fertility had converged for non-Hispanic
Protestants and non-Hispanic Catholics, while the fertility of Hispanic Catholics remained elevated (Mosher et al.,
1986). This hypothesis has not been examined for Mexico, because no study is
known which compares the socioeconomic characteristics of Mexican religious groups. Nevertheless, on the crucial characteristic of literacy, Catholics
may be favored by enhanced opportunities for schooling, which, despite church
doctrine, results in reduced fertility.

For the no-religion group, the characteristics and norms arguments appear
more logical than the minority status
one. One avenue of further study would
be to examine an expected higher pro
Social Biology

portion of non-believers among workers
in the petroleum and other unionized industries and their socioeconomic characteristics.

The norms hypothesis is that fertility
differences may be explained by different norms among religious groups, especially in regard to the intermediate biological and marriage variables such as
contraception, age at first marriage, etc.
An example is the influence of religious
affiliation on marfiage patterns in Ireland (Wright and Davies, 1974). In the
present case, this argument is also difficult to apply, due to lack of prior studies and appropriate data. For the noreligion group, future research might
decompose the category—i.e., aetheists, agnostics, believers in syncretist
religions—and assess the intermediate
variables associated with the groups.

Overall, the results on religion are
very strong and opposite to the worldwide Catholic-Protestant differential.
However, they are difficult to explain
due to lack of prior surveys with adequate sample designs studying individuals in the various religious groups.

The set of economic variables consists of male and female labor force participation, unemployment, and no/low
income. Overall, the most important economic variables are no/low income,
unemployment, and male labor force
participation. One theoretical explanation of economic effects which is useful
to this discussion focuses on the value of
children (Kasarda et al., 1986; Whiteford, 1986). According to this argument, couples make decisions on family
size based on the costs and benefits of
children. In rural areas, the costs of children are small while the benefits in
terms of labor and future security are
large. In more urban areas, the costs of
children rise substantially while their
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

Vol. 36, No. 1-2

benefits for labor decrease. These arguments are assumed to also apply when
the unit of analysis is the muncipio.

In urban areas the direction of effect
of unemployment and male labor force
participation on fertility corresponds to
an economic argument regarding reduced fertility. The reasoning is that in
urban areas there is greater economic
wellbeing. For urban municipios, greater economic wellbeing implies greater
ability of families to afford costs of
childbearing/rearing and greater government revenue leading to better infrastructure (schools, health facilities, etc.)
to support child rearing. Curiously, in
rural areas these variables do not reverse in direction as expected from the
argument. The effects for these two variables correspond to results for the Mexican borderlands in Pick et al. (19875)
and to the comparison model in Table
5.2

On the other hand, the increased fertility associated with no/low income in
the oil states samples is opposite to that
expected from this argument. An alternative argument is that in low-income
municipios, there are fewer funds available for families to purchase contraception, and governmental units are less
likely to support the dispersal of contraceptives and education in their use;
hence, fertility is higher. By comparison, in the borderlands samples, greater
income levels increase fertility in agreement with the economic—wellbeing argument. In the border rural areas, the
higher fertility rates with no/low income
correspond to the economic—wellbeing

For the borderlands samples, equations of less
than 1-to-10 ratio of variables to cases were further
tested by stepwise procedures. The stepwise
results corroborated the results shown in Table 5
with only minor differences.

61

argument, in that, in rural municipios
low income levels may lead to increased
childbearing as a way of offsetting future
detrimental effects of low income. Such
income differentials may be masked at
the state level, since Hicks (1974) found
no significant impact of income on fertility at the state level.

Possible explanation for male labor
force participation increasing fertility
takes an interactive perspective on the
male and female portions of the labor
force. The argument expands on the
standard model for female labor force
participation, in which female employment reduces fertility through both direct and indirect pathways (Kasarda et
al., 1986, Chap. 7). The additional reasoning is that in a limited labor market,
high male labor force participation reduces job possibilities for females. Alternatively, the argument can be reversed so higher childbearing lowers
female labor force participation resulting in increased job possibilities for
males. Regression results correspond to
this theory (i.e., positive male effect,
negative female effect) for the overall,
high urbanization, and rural samples.
Since similar interactive results are
present for the border region, an expanded theoretical model of male labor
force participation and fertility for Mexico appears to be necessary.

Literacy’s significant effect of reducing fertility for certain samples closely
corresponds to prior literature on the relationship of literacy and/or education
to fertility. In a broad theoretical discussion, Kasarda et al. (1986) regard education as the key variable affecting fertility
by allowing women to achieve independent status which in turn affects intermediate variables. Among studies in
Mexico, Seiver found that per cent of
population with no education was sec

ond in importance to urbanization as an
influence on child-woman ratio for 1970.
Holian (1983) demonstrated that, for a
sample of legally married women, higher education generally implied a lower
number of children ever born. Holian’s
1986 census-based study confirmed the
importance of literacy and education for
fertility but ascribed greater overall importance to primary education. Pick et
al. (1986, 1987b) found literacy to be the
dominant variable influencing fertility in

-the borderlands. In sum, the present

result showing reduced fertility by literacy is in accord with a large body of prior
studies. Likewise, the effect of urbanization in lowering fertility corresponds
to many previous studies of Mexican fertility (for example, Holian, 1983, 1986;
Garcia y Garma, 1979; and Seiver,
1975) as well as to worldwide studies
(Cleland and Hobcraft, 1985). The effects of urbanization may actually be
stronger than shown, since other variables may to some extent be acting as
proxies for it.

There is a slight negative effect of indigenous language in the low urbanization sample, and a strong negative effect
in the rural sample. These effects correspond to the results of Hicks for Mexican
states in 1970. Interpretation is difficult,
especially since raw fertility levels do
not vary much across indigenous samples. Perhaps more explanation could
be achieved by a detailed, individuallevel sample survey of differential fertility levels for a variety of indigenous and
nonindigenous groups across urban/
rural samples. Inmigration is not significant except for the low-urbanization
and medium-indigenous subsamples. Its
lesser overall significance corresponds
to comparison results for the borderlands (see Table 5) and to other studies
which included migration (see Pick et

 

Fertility Determinants 63

al., 1987a, b for example). Greater fertility associated with migration is opposite in direction to results of Repetto
(1979) for a Korean sample. However,
the present one-year migration measure
is of shorter duration than Repetto’s. In
the future, surveys which gather more
detailed migration histories at the individual level may alter this conclusion.

COMPARISON OF RESULTS FOR
SUBSAMPLES

Comparison of the three urban/rural
subsamples, reveals several major differences in the variables that significantly. influence fertility rates. For the
high urbanization sample, they are labor
force participation, no/low income, and
no religion; for the low urbanization
sample, no/low income, unemployment, non-Catholic religion, and urbanization. For the rural sample, the important variables are literacy, indigenous
language, and labor force participation.
These differences imply varying causation of fertility based on urban/rural location. Generally, indigenous language
usage is most important in the rural samples. The non-Catholic variable is weakest in the urban sample, whereas no religion lessens in importance the more
rural the sample. Economic variables
are important in specific ways for all
three samples. Inmigration (positive)
and urbanization (negative) are important only in the low urbanization sample. Elucidation of the latter differences
requires further research. Specifically,
the inmigration patterns of oil workers
need to be studied, including the levels
of urbanization of their destinations and
conversely their cumulative effects on
the urbanization of destination, as well
as the fertility patterns of inmigrants,
vis-a-vis their origins and destinations.

Comparison of the indigenous sam

ples shows distinctive patterns. For the
low indigenous sample, the most significant variables are economic—unemployment and no/low income. The medium indigenous sample closely resembles the low urbanization sample, with
literacy, non-Catholic, and urbanization
as the most significant determinants.
For the high indigenous sample, the important effects are no religion on increased fertility and a variety of economic effects. Overall, economic effects
are important in all three indigenous
samples; literacy is important in medium and low indigenous samples, while
religious variables are important in all
three samples, but more so in explaining
children ever born. More sophisticated
and detailed study of the indigenous
population in the oil region and elsewhere in Mexico will be necessary to explain fully these differences.

CONCLUSIONS

For the municipios in the oil region of
Mexico, regression analyses were conducted to estimate socioeconomic effects on fertility, measured by children
ever born to women, age 20-29, and by
child-woman ratio. The major findings
are summarized as follows:

1. Religious effects were of great importance, in particular the increased fertility in areas with greater concentrations of non-Catholics and of no
religion. The religious effects may be explained by one version of the minoritystatus hypothesis.

2. Economic determinants of fertility
were highly significant. Particularly notable were higher fertility in areas with
greater no/low income and male labor

force participation, and lower fertility in
areas with greater female labor force
participation but higher overall unemployment.

3. There are significant fertilitylowering effects from literacy and urbanization, both well-known effects in
previous worldwide and Mexican literature.

4. Inmigration is generally not significant except for secondary importance
in the Jow urbanization and medium indigenous areas.

5. Comparison across urban/rural
samples shows that religious variables
are important for the high and low urbanization samples but not for the rural
samples, that economic effects are important for all three samples, and that
indigenous language is most important
for the rural sample.

6. Comparison of indigenous samples reveal that literacy is more significant for the medium and low indigenous samples, while there are samplespecific religious and economic effects
for all three indigenous samples.
