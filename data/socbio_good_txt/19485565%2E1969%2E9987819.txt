A Further Query on Color Blindness

and Natural Selection

The high rates of red-green blindness
among European and a few Asian populations have been interpreted as a recent outcome of the relaxation of natural selection
(Pickford, 1959, 1963; Post, 1962, 1965).
It has been assumed that in primitive societies, dependent on hunting and food
gathering, the color-blind were at a decided
disadvantage and therefore selected against.
It has been suggested that while mutation
rates remained constant, the introduction
a few millennia ago of agriculture and the
beginning of civilization relaxed this negative selection and even brought about positive selection for the mutant genes in transitional cultures (Neel and Post, 1963). The
net result has been assumed to be an everincreasing rate of color blindness, roughly
proportional to the time elapsed since the
departure from the primitive ways of life.

Tables of world population frequencies
purporting to establish this trend were compiled by Post (1962), and the theory has
apparently been supported by a number of
subsequent population studies (Dutta, 1966;
Flatz, 1967; Kang et al., 1967).

Even though this is an attractive and
plausible theory, there are several reasons
for questioning its generalizations:

 

1. The proportionality of the rates of
color blindness with age of civilization does
not seem to be well established. Agriculture
and civilization in general began in nonEuropean regions, particularly along the
fertile river valleys of China, India, Mesopotamia, and Egypt, considerably earlier
than in Europe. Therefore, under the selection-relaxation theory, one would expect
the rates of color blindness to be lower
among Europeans than among Far and Middle Eastern populations. Actually, however,
the reverse is true, and this is particularly
significant if one considers the mean frequencies calculated for large samples, of
thousands of males each. Thus, the mean
European rate of 7.4% is contrasted with
5.4% in Chinese (Kherumian and Pickford,
1959), 4.8% in Japanese (Tanaka, 1963),
4.4% in Brahmins and 4.7% in other caste
Hindus (Dutta, 1966), and 5.1% in various
Middle Eastern Jews (Kalmus et al., 1961;
Adam et al., 1967). At the other end, the
moderate frequencies recorded in these ancient civilized societies are not always different from those found in some of the most
primitive populations on earth. There are
also reasons to doubt the accuracy and the

197

relevance of data obtained among some
primitive peoples.

2. It is indeed conceivable that color
blindness could be disadvantageous for the
gatherer of colored fruits. However, gathering appears to have been mainly the task
of women and children. Selection against
the color-blind gatherer is thus presumed to
have been of a much lesser genetic importance than selection against the color-blind
adult male hunter.

It is not at all certain, however, that
color blindness would always be a drawback for the hunter. Moreover, there are
some lines of evidence which would point
to a possible advantage of color blindness
for primitive man. Flicker photometry has
proved that the color-blind individual is
more sensitive than the normal individual
to differences of brightness, when two colors
are compared. De Vries (1948) noted that
“very accurate adjustments [of brightnessmatch] can only be obtained by observers
with a bad colour vision (e.g. dichromats).”’
This has also been confirmed by later studies
(Adam, 1969; Crone, 1968). The color-blind
hunter may therefore be quicker than others
to spot slight changes in illumination caused
by a moving animal, and he may be less
frequently deceived by camouflage patterns
on animals (Kalmus, 1965; Thoday, 1965;
Roberts, 1967). It is thus possible that under
certain conditions the color-blind male may
even be a more successful hunter than one
with normal vision. The involvement of
color-blind gunners in shooting accidents
cited by Neel and Post (1963), may only
serve to stress this point.

Furthermore, because of this superior sensitivity, the color-blind individual might
have a better chance to survive in some
primitive environments, since he would also
be quicker than the normal to avoid—or to
kill—such camouflaged deadly enemies as
humans and snakes. It is perhaps not a
mere coincidence that the highest frequencies of color blindness recorded among in

digenous Papuan—New-Guinean populations
—6.0%, 6.4%, and 9.3% (Adam, Wood,
Symons, Ord, and Smith, unpublished data)
—were encountered in the limited, relatively
dry area of about five thousand square miles
of lightly wooded, grass-covered country of
the South Papuan Coast. This is the only
part of the territories of Papua and New
Guinea in which three very venomous species of diurnal snakes abound and where
snake bites form a common medical problem
(Campbell, 1964; Campbell and Arthur,
1964).

3. “‘Red-green color blindness” is a collective term for at least six different X-linked
defects, governed by two genetic loci and
comprising mild anomalous trichromacies
together with the much severer dichromacies. It is hardly conceivable that selection,
in whichever way it might have been operating on ‘‘color blindness,” would equally
affect all types of color blindness. Anyone
who has witnessed the dramatic difference
between the anomaloscopic performance of
a dichromat (and particularly of a protanope) and that of an anomalous trichromat
(and particularly of a nearly normal deuteranomal) would probably not be surprised
at the idea that selection could even operate
simultaneously in opposite directions on
various types of “‘color blindness.” This may
be true for any given environment, to say
nothing of the extreme differences between
the possible role of colors and of color vision
in the environments of primitive man, ranging from the all-white landscape of the
Eskimo to the dazzling multicolored surroundings of the tropical forest dweller.

It has been argued (Adam et al., 1967;
Crone, 1968) that if selection was eliminating the severer types of color blindness in
primitive societies, then relaxation of this
selection pressure should have resulted in
increased proportions of the severe types
among the “civilized” populations. However, this has never been shown to be the
case, as no relevant data are available for

the great majority of human populations
since most surveys were conducted by using
merely pseudo-isochromatic plates like Ishihara and H-R-R. It has been repeatedly
stressed by all authorities on color vision
that accurate diagnoses of the defects can
only be established through anomaloscopy
(Waardenburg et al., 1963). Pickford, the
distinguished researcher of color blindness
and an early proponent of the idea of relaxed
selection, was well aware of the scarcity of
population data in this respect. He wrote
(1963), “Unfortunately the anomaloscope
has been used very little except among white
populations.... Where the Ishihara test
was used, and this was the most popular
test, differences of supposed degree and
type of defect could not be relied upon to
reveal the proportion of anomalous trichromats to dichromats with any confidence.
Pseudo-isochromatic plates are very unsatisfactory from this point of view.... A
study of the relative frequencies of types
and degrees of defect in a variety of different groups would be interesting.”
Recently, a few non-European populations have been surveyed by a combination
of a rapid screening with the plates and
subsequent examination of all those who
failed or even hesitated on the plates, with
a portable anomaloscope, notably the Pickford-Nicolson anomaloscope which may
also be operated on car batteries (Pickford
and Lakowski, 1960; Adam, 1968). Incidentally, these surveys indicated that some
of the previously reported low rates of ‘“‘redgreen blindness” were underestimates because of incorrect interpretation of the examinees’ performances on pseudo-isochromatic plates. On the one hand, there are
perfectly normal people who make a few
mistakes which are characteristic for colorblind individuals (Crone, 1961, 1968; Adam
et al., 1967). On the other hand, it has been
noted (Crone, 1961, 1968; Green, 1962;
Cruz-Coke and Barrera, 1969; Adam et al.,
1969) that there are color-blind individuals,

199

and particularly anomalous trichomats, who
are able to see almost all the normal figures
on the plates. This happens especially if
some plates have been omitted from the
test, which is a usual and permissible practice in screening surveys, and if the examinees are allowed or encouraged to concentrate for several additional seconds on
each plate, which is contrary to the instructions given by the authors of the tests. Obviously, this would be the case even more
frequently in testing illiterates, since they
take much more time to trace the lines.
Furthermore, tracing the normal lines would
be easier for them if some marks have
been left on the plates by the fingers of
previously examined normals. Some of these
mildly color-blind individuals were apparently considered to be slightly erring or
careless normals and were therefore passed
as normals in some surveys. The low frequencies of color blindness reported previously for a few populations were indeed
found later, through anomaloscopy, to approximate the frequencies of dichromacies
only (Adam et al., 1969).

I do not mean to indicate that all previous data are invalid or that all surveys
which are based on plates only are bound to
underestimate the rates of color blindness. A
proper handling of these tests does indeed
lead to a reasonable approximation of the
true rate, even in a population of illiterates,
provided that the survey is done by an experienced observer, who is aware of the pitfalls mentioned above and who strictly follows the instructions accompanying the
tests, particularly regarding rapidity, choice
of plates, and illumination.

But even if one accepts all previous population data as correct, they are still of
little value for the present discussion. They
give only overall rates of “red-green deficiencies” or, at most, a rough approximation of the “protan-deutan ratio.” Indeed,
only a few reports of this kind include a
tentative, necessarily unreliable classificaDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

tion, of the defects according to severity.
Such a classification, however, seems to be
the one most relevant for any attempt to
evaluate the possible effects, both of selection and of relaxed selection, on the frequencies of “color blindness.”

hopefully be done when more extensive
anomaloscopic data become available.

The populations are arranged in the table

arrange them according to the length of
their civilized history. There can be little
doubt, however, that some populations

compiled in Table 1. Dichromacies include
protanopia and deuteranopia and trichromacies—protanomaly, extreme protanomaly,
deuteranomaly, and extreme deuteranomaly. The grouping of these six defects into
two categories of severity must be considered merely as a preliminary way of analyzing population data. Pickford (1963) has
already stressed that each of the defects

another case was encountered in Uganda in which
a new anomaloscopic survey more than doubled a
previous estimate for the overall rate of color blindness. Again that previous estimate was proved to

approximate the rate of dichromacies only (Adam,
Mwesigye, and Tabani, to be published).

Vol. 16, No. 3

populations with higher rates of overall
“red-green blindness.” This is the preponderance of deuteranomaly. Of the ‘‘colorblinds” in these populations 50-75% are
deuteranomals, and this holds true irrespective of their level of civilization (e.g., SouthCoastal Papuans, Israeli Arabs, and all
Europeans). However, deuteranomaly is
generally considered to be the mildest deviation from normal red-green vision (Waardenburg, 1963; Pickford, 1963). Thus, even
if one considers the finding among Papuans
as spurious, one should try to explain why
the relaxation of selection among Europeans
and some Arabs has resulted in increased
rates of this mildest of all defects, and yet a
similar phenomenon has not taken place in
other old civilizations, like the Japanese or
Yemenite Jews.

The foregoing discussion and the new
data presented seem to make it difficult to
accept the selection-relaxation theory in its
original form. The rates of red-green color
blindness, in both primitive and civilized
societies, are much higher than those of
total color blindness or of blue blindness
(tritanomaly and tritanopia) and are hardly
explainable by recurrent mutations only.
It is probable, therefore, that a rather more
complex interplay of factors may be involved, such as disruptive selection as suggested by Thoday (1965), which would include this series of traits among other genetic polymorphisms. The recent discovery
by Waaler (1967) of two common genetic
variants of normal red-green vision would
further support this conclusion.

It should be admitted, however, that
there are too many gaps in our knowledge
of allele frequencies in human populations,

and particularly among primitive societies
still living on all continents, and that data
relevant for an attempt to reformulate a
theory for the maintenance of this polymorphism are still lacking. It is hoped that
these gaps will be closed before long. This
can be done more properly today, since even
in very primitive populations it is possible
to find large enough samples of literate
people among whom surveys may be conducted under the same conditions and with
the same methods as used for the older '
civilizations. It is essential, however, that
this task be undertaken by investigators
well trained and well equipped for the proper collection of this missing information.

SUMMARY

The contention that high rates of redgreen blindness characterize old civilizations
and are due to relaxed selection are inconsistent with some population data.

Possible advantages of color blindness for
primitive man are pointed out, which may
have counteracted natural selection.

It is argued that discussion of selection
and relaxation should be based on data differentiating mild from severe defects. Such
data are obtainable only through anomaloscopy and are lacking for the great majority
of non-European societies. Moreover, some
surveys based only on pseudo-isochromatic
plates have probably underestimated the
rates of trichromatic defects.

The limited anomaloscopic data available from human populations pose further
difficulties for the theory of relaxed selection,
since rates of severe dichromatic defects
show no proportionality to age of civilization.
