ABSTRACT: This research uses a multivariate log-linear examination of a national data set to
analyze the combined influences of ethnicity, age, and sex on cigarette smoking status, not only
for smokers but for former smokers and current nonsmokers as well. In general, we find that
demographic differences in smoking vary across several dimensions. For instance, compared to
females, males are more likely to smoke and to smoke heavily. The differences between male
and female cessation rates vary with ethnicity; also, males and females tend to have different
ratios of former smokers to light, moderate, and heavy smokers. Mexican-Americans who
smoke generally smoke small quantities of cigarettes. And Blacks are as likely as other groups
not to smoke at all, and less likely than Anglos to smoke heavily. This article discusses potential
future mortality effects, intervention strategies, and directions for future research.

Cigarette smoking is the single most
important preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. It
contributes to about 20 per cent of all
deaths, differences between the sexes in
life expectancies, and is responsible for
over 80 per cent of all lung cancer deaths
and 40 per cent of coronary heart disease deaths (Shopland and Brown,
1987; U.S. Dept. of Health and Human
Services [DHHS], 1989; and Miller and
Gerstein, 1983). Accordingly, there is a
national emphasis on understanding the
correlates and reducing the prevalence
of cigarette smoking, both within the total population and within minority subpopulations (DHHS, 1989; CDC,
1987a). Because ethnic groups differ
significantly in smoking patterns, even
when analyses control for age and sex,
research and policy agendas must recognize these differences and interactions.
Our research endeavors to employ rela
tively new methodological tools to shed
new light on the interactions among
smoking, ethnicity, age, and sex.
Cigarette smoking prevalence has
generally declined for the entire population since the 1960’s. Although male cigarette smoking rates gradually declined
from 50 to 30 per cent between 1966 and
1986, female smoking rates hovered
around 32 per cent between 1965 and
1976. Only since 1976 have female
smoking rates begun to decline. But by
1986, the female rate was the lowest
ever recorded: 24 per cent (CDC,
1987b). Some researchers contend that
the decline in cigarette smoking among
males was due primarily to smoking cessation, and that males are more likely to
quit than females. For the late 1970's,
however, some researchers have demonstrated that men and women were
equally likely to quit (Orlandi, 1986),
while others have shown that males are

still more likely than females to quit
(Kabat and Wynder, 1987). Our research can help resolve this question.

Further research is needed to clarify
past interactions among smoking, lung
cancer, and ethnicity, and to determine
how these interactions have changed.
Investigations of Anglos and Hispanics
have demonstrated the importance of
age and sex for identifying differences in
smoking patterns. For example, Hispanic males are as likely to smoke as
Anglo males, but Hispanic males consume fewer cigarettes and experience
lower lung cancer mortality rates. Compared with Anglo females, Hispanic females seldom smoke; when they do,
they smoke fewer cigarettes (Holck et
al., 1982; Humble et al., 1985; Marcus
and Crane, 1984; Markides et al., 1987).

Nationally, more Blacks than Anglos
smoke, but Anglos smoke more than do
Blacks; and more Blacks smoke and
smoke more than do MexicanAmericans. Within all ethnic groups,
men begin their smoking earlier, smoke
more frequently, and smoke more than
do women (Rogers and Crank, 1988).

To extend the current knowledge of
ethnic differences in smoking patterns,
we have examined, within a multivariate
framework, smoking histories of younger as well as older respondents from a
large national sample to assess the
unique impact of each of the predictors—ethnicity, age, and sex—on
cigarette smoking status not only for
smokers, but for former smokers and
nonsmokers as well.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

We used the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to study smoking
patterns among ethnic groups. NHIS

tistage probability design that permits a
continuous sampling of the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the
United States through both cluster and
stratified sampling techniques. We used
the 1985 Health Promotion and Disease
Prevention supplement, which includes
a total of 33,630 respondents ages 18 and
over (NCHS, 1986).

To examine cigarette smoking status,
we fit several log-linear models to the
four-way contingency table of gender
(G), by age (A), by ethnicity (E), by
smoking status (S). The categories for
each variable are defined as follows:
gender (male, female); age (18-24, 2534, 35-44, 45-54, 55 and over); ethnicity (Mexican-American, Anglo, and
Black);! and smoking status (never,
former, and current smokers who
smoke less than one-half package of cigarettes per day, one-half to less than one
package per day, one to less than two, or
two or more packages of cigarettes per
day).* Because we focused on three eth
‘Examining Hispanics—a heterogeneous
group that includes Puerto Ricans, MexicanAmericans, and individuals of Spanish descent—
as a single ethnic group may result in misleading
findings (Hayes-Bautesta, 1983). Therefore, we
coded as Mexican-American only respondents
who identified themselves as Mexican, Mexicano,
Mexican-American, and Chicano. Cubans, Puerto
Ricans, and the group “Other Hispanics”’ were excluded from the data set because they were too few
to analyze separately and too diverse to combine
with Mexican-Americans. Anglos and Blacks were
selected from those who did not identify themselves as being of Spanish origin.

*Cigarette consumption divisions follow convention and provide natural breakpoints. Never
smokers reported never smoking; former smokers
smoked in the past but do not currently smoke. Because there is “‘cigarette-heaping”’ at the consumption levels ending in zero (e.g., 10, 20, 30, 40), we
included these reported numbers with.the higher
consumption levels. For instance, 10 cigarettes is
included not with less than 1/2 a pack, but with 1/2
to less than 1 pack of cigarettes. For ease in explication, we refer to fewer than 10 cigarettes as /2a
pack, to 10-19 cigarettes as 1 pack, to 20-39 cigarettes as 2 packs, and to 40 or more as over 2 packs.

nic groups, our data set was comprised
of 31,929 Mexican-American, Anglo,
and Black respondents. From this data
set, we excluded 2 per cent, or 704 respondents who did not answer questions
on current or past smoking behavior,
which provided us with 31,225 individuals.

Because the data set was created
through a multistage probability sample, which is designed to represent the
U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population, we have incorporated the sample
weights into our descriptive and multivariate analyses. This will provide an accurate representation of each group and
will allow us to generalize our results to
the U.S. adult population. In presenting

the descriptive findings, we provide the
actual sample size to indicate the size of
the sample, even though the percentages and means are weighted.

RESULTS
DESCRIPTIVE RESULTS

Table 1 presents the distribution of
smoking status by ethnicity, age, and
sex. This table shows that, generally,
there are more never smokers who are
female rather than male, MexicanAmerican rather than Anglo or Black,
and young rather than older. Another
interesting finding is that, compared to
other groups, Anglo males are more
likely to have quit smoking.

Among present smokers, Table 2
shows the average cigarette consumption levels. Generally, of those who
smoke, males smoke more than females, and Anglos smoke more than
Mexican-Americans or Blacks. Indeed,
Anglo males and females each average
about a pack of cigarettes per day; Black
males and females average less than
three-quarters of a pack of cigarettes;
Mexican-American males and females
average a little over a half-pack. The relations among age and cigarette consumption are not as clear, but show increasing cigarette consumption from the
teen years until the 40’s or 50’s, at which
ages cigarette consumption begins to decline. Although Tables 1 and 2 begin to
show such relations, they have not controlled for interactions. Therefore, they
provide few unequivocal findings about
exact patterns because of obvious statistical interdependencies among ethnicity, sex, and age. For example, do sex
differences in smoking persist, net of sex
differences in age and ethnicity? Do ethnic differences in smoking persist, net of
ethnic differences in sex and age? To answer such questions, we must employ a
multivariate framework such as loglinear analysis.

 

Social Biology

Loc-LINEAR RESULTS

Log-linear analysis is a well-known
technique that is used to examine the
structural relations among variables in a
contingency table. It permits nominal
dependent variables (e.g., the smoking
statuses), allows several variables to be
considered simultaneously and interpreted separately, and makes no assumptions about homoscedasticity or
linearity (Kaufman and Schervish, 1986,
1987). The main task of log-linear analysis is to determine which combination of
independent variables and interactions
most parsimoniously describes the interacting effects upon smoking status of
age, sex, and ethnicity.

Our modeling process began with a
baseline model that specified no interactions between smoking status and the independent variables. Its chi-square
value may be taken to indicate the total
amount of variance in smoking that may
be explained by the independent variables of age, gender, and ethnicity. The
hypothetical models were tested against
the baseline model until a “‘best-fitting”’
model was found, that is, a model exhibiting a large change in the maximum
likelihood chi-square value, L?, and one

that was consonant with the theoretical
focus. The models were tested at the
significance level of 0.01. The baseline
model, which had an L? of 4,918, a p
value of 0.000, and 145 degrees of freedom, did not fit the data. In analyzing
differences in L? through chi-squared
comparisons, we determined that the
best-fitting model was (EGA) (EGS)
(EAS) (GAS), where E = ethnicity,
G = gender, A = age, and S = smoking status. This indicates that in addition
to all the two-way interactions, four
three-way interactions are important in
explaining smoking status. The fact that
the model provided a fit with an L? of 48,
a p value of 0.2, and 40 degrees of freedom and accounted for 99 per cent of
the baseline chi-square suggests that it is
a good model for these data.

Of the several different relations to
examine, we focus on sex and ethnic differences in smoking statuses, controlling for age. We begin by examining
gender differences in smoking by ethnicity and controlling for age.

SEX DIFFERENCES BY ETHNICITY

To interpret our results, we employed expected odds-ratios, derived
from tau parameters, for three types of
contrasts—generalized, semigeneralized, and comparative.* Generalized
odds ratios compare the odds of one versus all other categories of the dependent
variable, in this case smoking behavior,
with those of one category of an independent variable versus all other categories of that variable (Kaufman and

7Semigeneralized contrasts are discussed in the
next section, but are not presented for gender differences by ethnicity because for dichotomous relations (e.g., male and female), semigeneralized
and comparative contrasts provide the same information,

Cigarette Smokers 5

Schervish, 1987). To illustrate, Table 3
shows that among Mexican-Americans,
the odds of never versus ever smoking
(which includes former and current
smoking at various consumption levels)
are over two-and-one-half times greater
for females than for all other sexes (in
this case, ‘‘all others” equals simply
‘“‘males’’). Irrespective of ethnicity, females are more likely than males to have
never smoked (Table 3).

Comparative odds ratios compare
the odds of one versus another specific
category of the dependent variable with
those of one versus another specific category of an independent variable (Kaufman and Schervish, 1987). Such odds ratios compare, for instance, females to
males with respect to, say, never versus
formerly smoking. The first entry in Table 4, 2.0, shows that MexicanAmerican females are twice as likely as
males to have never smoked rather than
to have smoked formerly. The smoking
status comparisons in the table are given
sequentially. For instance, never smokers are compared with all other statuses;
former smokers are compared with all
subsequent statuses, but not with never
smokers, since that comparison was
made previously. To determine the
odds of Mexican-American females versus males having formerly smoked ver

sus never smoking, take the reciprocal
of never to former smokers (or 1/2.0 or
0.5).

Without exception, females are more
likely than males to have never smoked.
Generally, Mexican-American females
are as likely if not more likely than their
male counterparts to quit smoking
rather than continue (Table 4). One explanation for the high quit rates among
Mexican-American females is that they
are more likely than other groups to be
around nonsmoking peers (Markides et
al., 1987). Among Anglos and Blacks,
males are more likely than females to be
former rather than light smokers. For
instance, Anglo females are 21/2 to 2
times more likely than are males to
smoke 1/2 to 1 pack of cigarettes rather

than quit smoking.* Only compared to
those who smoke two or more packs of
cigarettes per day are Anglo and Black
females as likely if not more likely than
males to quit smoking. In all but a few
instances, among all ethnic groups, females are more likely than males to
smoke light to moderate rather than
heavy amounts of cigarettes. Such rela

odds for several comparisons at one point in time,

Therefore, Table 4 shows that among Anglos,
males are more likely than females to quit rather
than smoke a package of cigarettes. This does not
indicate that among Anglos who smoke a package
of cigarettes, males are more likely than females to
quit.

tions compare males and females within
ethnic groups; but we can also compare
ethnic groups within sexes.

ETHNIC DIFFERENCES BY SEX

Among males and females, MexicanAmericans are more likely to have
never smoked than Anglo or Black men
and women (Table 5). For instance,
Mexican-American females are more
than twice as likely to have never
smoked as are Anglo or Black women.
Although some studies have reported
that Blacks, especially Black males, are
more likely to smoke than other ethnic
groups (McGinnis et al., 1987), our findings indicate that, controlling for age,
Black males are similar to other groups
in their chances of never smoking.

Table 6 re-emphasizes that, compared to other ethnic groups, MexicanAmericans are generally more likely to
have never rather than ever smoked.
When they do smoke, they are likely to
smoke moderately. For instance,
Mexican-American males are over 2
times more likely than other males to
smoke !/2 rather than 1 package of cigarettes a day, over 5 times more likely to
smoke 1/2 rather than 2 packs a day, and
over 3 times more likely to smoke 1/2
rather than over 2 packs of cigarettes per
day. Mexican-American females follow
a similar pattern.

Mexican-American males are more
likely than other males to have quit as
opposed to smoking large amounts of
cigarettes. For example, compared to
other males, Mexican-American males
are over twice as likely to have quit
rather than smoke 2 packs of cigarettes
per day, and almost one-and-one-half
times more likely to quit rather than
smoke over 2 packs of cigarettes per
day. But they are less likely than men of
other ethnicities to have quit smoking
rather than smoke one-half a pack of
cigarettes per day. Mexican-American
females parallel Mexican-American
males, but with a more pronounced pattern. Indeed, Mexican-American females are almost 3 times more likely
than other females to quit rather than
smoke a pack of cigarettes per day.

Anglo males are more likely than
other males to have quit as opposed to
smoking small amounts of cigarettes.
For example, compared to other males,
Anglo males are almost 6 times more
likely to have quit rather than smoke !/2
a pack of cigarettes, and over 21/2 times
more likely to quit rather than smoke 1
pack of cigarettes per day. But they are
less likely than men of other ethnicities
to have quit smoking rather than smoke

2 packs or more of cigarettes. Except for
the heaviest consumption level, Black
males are less likely than other males to
quit smoking. Conversely, compared to
other females, Black females are more
likely to quit rather than smoke small
amounts of cigarettes, but less likely to
quit than smoke large amounts of cigarettes.

Anglo males are much more likely
than other males to smoke heavily: 10
times more likely to smoke over 2 packs
rather than 1/2 a pack of cigarettes, 5
times more likely to smoke over 2 packs
rather than 1 pack of cigarettes, and
over 11/2 times more likely to smoke
over 2 packs rather than 2 packs of cigarettes per day. On the other hand, Anglo females are much less likely than
other females to smoke heavily.

Table 7 shows specific ethnic comparisons that generally reflect the results in
Table 6, but with some interesting deviations. Mexican-Americans are generally more likely than Anglo males to
never smoke rather than smoke heavily.
If they do smoke, they are more likely to
smoke light to moderate rather than
heavy amounts. Indeed, compared to
Anglo males, Mexican-American males
are over 11 times more likely to smoke
less than 1/2 pack rather than over 2
packs of cigarettes per day. However,
Mexican-American males are often
more likely than Anglo males to smoke
a few cigarettes rather than quit smoking altogether. These same relations
generally hold for Mexican-American
versus Black males. Compared to Anglo
males, Black males always smoke fewer
cigarettes. Indeed, compared to Anglo
males, Black males are 5 times more
likely to smoke 1/2 rather than 2 packs of
cigarettes per day, 10 times more likely
to smoke 1/2 rather than 2 or more packs
of cigarettes per day, and 10 times more

likely to smoke 1 rather than 2 or more
packs of cigarettes per day. Such results
confirm previous findings (Fiore et al.,
1989; Orleans et al., 1989; Novotny et
al., 1988).

Among females, one interesting pattern shows that, compared to Anglo females, Mexican-American females are
always more likely to have never
smoked rather than ever smoked, and to
quit rather than smoke any amount.
Compared to Black women, MexicanAmerican and Anglo women are always
more likely to smoke light rather than
heavy amounts of cigarettes. Compared
to Anglo females, however, MexicanAmerican females are more likely to
smoke heavy rather than light to moderate amounts of cigarettes.

DISCUSSION

It is important to disaggregate smoking status, as we have illustrated, because of the substantial differences
among ethnic and sex subpopulations,
and because prevention efforts can best
be directed to specific target populations
and smoking statuses.

Males are more likely than females to
smoke and to smoke heavily (Rogers
and Crank, 1988). Such relations complement Gottlieb and Baker’s findings
that males and females are more likely
to smoke if their friends smoke, especially if their friends who smoke are of
the same sex (Gottlieb and Baker,
1986). Our findings add a new twist to
the debate about whether males or fe

males are more likely to quit smoking.
We have found that the ratio of former
to current smokers varies not only by
ethnicity but also, within the category of
current smokers, by the number of cigarettes consumed. Among Anglos and
Blacks, the sexes display different quit
ratios depending upon levels of cigarette
consumption. Generally, the ratio of
quitters to light smokers is higher among
males than among females, but the ratio
of quitters to heavy smokers is lower.
Mexican-American females, however,
usually have quit ratios as high as those
of males, if not higher, no matter what
level of consumption is chosen for the
comparison. Therefore, programs for
males could stress the importance of not
smoking, of smoking moderately if at
all, and last, of quitting, especially at the
higher levels of consumption. Programs
to encourage prevention and cessation
among women are now especially important in light of the fact that lung cancer has surpassed breast cancer as the
leading cause of death among women
(Ernster, 1986).

Anglo and Black females are less
likely than males to begin smoking, but
they are usually more likely to continue
smoking once they begin. We suspect
that the increasing research on smoking
among females, the development of
grade- and high-school curricula to combat the onset of smoking within this
group, and local, state, and national
antismoking campaigns are having a
significant impact on young female
smokers (DHHS, 1980). Unfortunately, most antismoking programs are
in educational settings. Additional
community-, health-care-, and worksite-based programs for adults are
needed to prevent smoking among nonsmokers and to enhance the chances for
smoking reduction or cessation among

smokers. Nevertheless, individuals are
becoming more aware of the adverse
health effects of cigarette smoking (Shopland and Brown, 1987).

Our findings confirm that, compared
to males, Mexican-American females at
every age seldom smoke and when they
do, they smoke only a few cigarettes per
day, and are likely to quit. MexicanAmerican males, on the other hand, are
more likely to smoke and relatively less
likely to quit, although they smoke
fewer cigarettes than do other ethnic
groups. Effective programs for
Mexican-Americans, then, should recognize the important gender differences; females should be discouraged
from initiating smoking and encouraged
to maintain their low levels of smoking,
whereas programs aimed at males could
encourage those who have already
started smoking to quit.

Some researchers express concern
that because Mexican-American males
are as likely to smoke as Anglo males,
their current low rate of lung cancer will
increase until it is commensurate with
Anglo rates (Marcus and Crane, 1984).
Our findings do not show this. Moreover, we make a more optimistic forecast, based not on smoking prevalence
rates, but on the low odds of heavy
smoking, the high odds of light smoking,
and the high odds of smoking cessation
among Mexican-American males.

Blacks have been attributed with
higher rates of smoking than Anglos and
Hispanics (McGinnis et al., 1987), and
lower rates of quitting than Whites (Kabat and Wynder, 1987; Fiore et al.,
1989; Wynder, 1988). Our findings show
that quit rates vary by cigarette consumption. Even though Anglos have
higher ratios than Blacks of quitters to
light smokers, they have lower ratios of
quitters to heavy smokers. If one disagDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

gregates current smokers by cigarette
consumption, new results arise. The aggregate results—that Blacks have lower
overall quit rates than Anglos—may still
persist because proportionately there
are more smokers at the low consumption levels and fewer smokers at the
heavier consumption levels. It is important, however, to look beyond the aggregate statistics, because the association between smoking and disease is
complex.

Smoking patterns by ethnicity anticipate future diseases; even as smoking
prevalence declines, illnesses attributed
to smoking will continue well into the
twenty-first century (CDC, 1988). If individuals were to stop smoking, much
morbidity, disability, and mortality due
to cancers and respiratory and circulatory diseases could be treated and prevented (DHHS, 1989). Moreover,
smoking is linked to other unhealthy behaviors (Schoenborn and Benson,
1988). It might therefore be possible to
reduce other unhealthy behaviors by reducing cigarette smoking; however, if
smoking becomes more widespread, especially among new subpopulations, we
can anticipate subsequent changes in

disease and mortality patterns. Currently, the cigarette industry is actively
promoting cigarettes through advertisements in newspapers and magazines,
sponsorship of entertainment and cultural events, special promotions, and
widespread use of billboards which are
targeted to women and minorities
(CDC, 1987a; Davis, 1987). This research, which has characterized the subpopulations most at risk of initiating, increasing, and continuing smoking behaviors within a multivariate framework, may contribute to social and public health efforts to further reduce smoking within the United States.
