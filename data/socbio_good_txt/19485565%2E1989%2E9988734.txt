ABSTRACT: The frequency distribution of various consanguineous marriages was studied in the
city of Madras, Tamil Nadu, South India. Parallel first cousin marriages (PFC) were found to
occur in appreciable frequencies in all caste groups of Hindus. While it has been generally
believed that PFC marriages among Hindus are mere exceptions and are usually not tolerated,
our data show that they can no longer be treated as exceptions. The high frequency (27 per cent)
of PFC marriages in some Hindu communities necessitates in-depth studies to elucidate the
forces at work which go against the very fundamentals of Dravidian kinship.

In human societies, matings between
individuals largely associate with the social institutions of marriage, and consanguineous marriages (CM) are largely
reflections of cultural behavior of the
mating groups (Reid, 1973). Over the
past three decades several contributions
have been made on inbreeding in India
and its theoretical and empirical risks
(Sanghvi, 1954; Dronamraju and
Meerakhan, 1963; Sanghvi, 1966; Centerwal and Centerwal, 1966; Rao et al.,
1972; Roy Choudhury, 1976; Rao and
Inbaraj, 1977; Srikumari et al., 1985).

In South India the inbreeding rates
are very high, although not as high as the
values of inbreeding that have been reported in some of the human isolates living in Western parts of the world. However, it is noteworthy that the practice of
marrying the father’s brother’s daughter
(FBD) or mother’s sister’s daughter
(MSD), i.e., parallel cousin marriages,
is forbidden in Hindu society, since they
are thought to be as sisters. In contrast,

248

in Middle Eastern cultures FBD marriage, which is taboo in many cultures of
the world (Murphy and Kasdan, 1967),
is overtly preferred. This practice has received much attention in the literature
on marriage in the Middle east (Ayoub,
1959; Patai, 1962; Gilbert and Hammel,
1966; Goldberg, 1967, Khuri, 1970).

In India, studies on Tamil Nadu as a
whole are available (Rao et al., 1972;
Rao and Inbaraj, 1977, 1980), but there
has been no study exclusively on inbreeding in Madras city, an important
metropolis of South India. Changing
patterns in marriage preferences corresponding to changing matrimonial behavior in modern urban life styles, especially in a city like Madras, need
systematic sampling and study.

The detection of an an association between endogamy, religious affiliation,
and socioeconomic status has implications for future genetic studies in this
area. As stressed by many authors (Neel
and Schull, 1970; Rao and Inbaraj,
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

1977, 1980; Srikumari et al., 1985; Klat
and Khudr, 1986), consanguinity effects
of demographic and health parameters
are likely to be overshadowed by the social components.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Madras is the fourth largest city in India. The sample used here was selected
using stratified random sampling techniques. The city was divided longitudinally into North, Central, and South and
vertically into East and West. The city as
a whole was divided into 81 areas identified on the city map. Then 10 per cent
of the 81 areas, proportionate to the
number of areas in each of the five zones
as divided longitudinally and vertically,
were randomly selected.

Within a given area all houses located
on either side of every fifth street were
included. Care was taken to give representation to the slums. A standard questionnaire was prepared both in English
and in the local language, Tamil. Respondents were personally visited. After the objectives of the study were explained to them, they were asked to fill
out the questionnaire. Of the sample, 88
per cent (3,527 couples) filled out the
questionnaires.

Of the respondents, 81.5 per cent
were Hindus. Christians and Muslims
constituted 15.5 and 2.7 per cent of the
sample, respectively. Couples belonging to different religions and castes, 0.3
and 0.4 per cent respectively, were excluded from the analysis. All caste
groups constituting 1 per cent or more of
the sample were listed separately.

The remaining caste groups were
grouped into four categories: (1) Other
South Indian Brahmins (OSIB); (2)
Other South Indian castes (OSIC); (3)

Parallel Cousin Marriages

 

249

North Indian Brahmins (NIB); and (4)

Other North Indian Castes (ONIC).
The general formula of Malecot

(1948) has been used for computing the

coefficient of inbreeding.

sibs (cross first cousins, CFC) are more
frequent than marriages between the
children of like-sexed sibs (parallel first
cousins, PFC). CFC marriages constituted about 91 per cent of all first cousin
marriages. In CFC marriages, the ratio
between mother’s brother’s daughter
(MBD) and father’s sister’s daughter
(FSD) marriages was 1.23. However, in
a study of the state of Tamil Nadu as a
whole (Rao and Inbaraj, 1977), MBD
marriages were significantly more frequent than FSD marriages. In PFC marriages the ratio between MSD and FBD
marriages was 2.69:1 (Table 2).

FREQUENCY OF CONSANGUINEOUS
MARRIAGES IN PRINCIPAL
RELIGIOUS GROUPS

The highest frequency of consanguineous marriages were found in Muslims
(27.66 per cent), followed by Hindus
(25.93 per cent) and Christians (13.48
per cent). In all the religious groups FC
matriages were more frequent than
other types (Table 3). Although uncleniece (UN) marriages are forbidden by
the Koran, a frequency of 7.45 per cent
was found among Muslims in this study.
This finding shows that the local custom

of consanguineous marriage in Tamil
Nadu has deeper impact than could be
modified by the religious influences.

The relative frequency of CFC and
PFC marriages also varied (Table 4). In
Muslims, PFC marriages occurred in
about 59 per cent of FCM marriages
contracted. PFC marriages were more
common among Christians (11 per cent)
than among Hindus (7 per cent).

Of the two types of CFC marriages
among Hindus and Muslims, FSD marTlages were more frequent than MBD
marriages. The ratio of MBD and FSD
marriages among Hindus was 1:1.26 and
among Muslims, 1:1.33. Among Christians, both MBD and FSD marriages
were equally frequent.

Of the two types of PFC marriages,
Muslims preferred FBD marriages,
while Hindu and Christians preferred
MSD marriages.

FREQUENCY OF CONSANGUINEOUS
MARRIAGES IN CASTE GROUPS OF HINDUS

Hindu social hierarchy is a complex
network of caste groups based on varied
factors like occupation, customs, beliefs, migrations, and a host of other influences, resulting in a remarkable degree of isolation among the groups.
However, these caste isolates are slowly
becoming separated from their traditional environments and being incorporated into the general pool.

Table 5 shows the distribution of
couples by type of marriage among caste
groups of Hindus. Consanguineous
marriages varied from 3 per cent in Jains
to about 37 per cent in Achari. Consanguineous marriages represented more
than 30 per cent of marriages in 6 of the
12 caste groups listed (Mudaliar, Adi
Dravidar, Naicker, Chettiar, Achari,
and Pillai). The consanguinity rate was

Parallel Cousin Marriages

251

in the range of 20-30 per cent among
Naidu, Nadar, and Yadava and below
20 per cent in Tamil Brahmins, Nairs,
and Jains.

UN marriages were highest in
Acharis (18 per cent) and lowest in Nairs
(3 per cent). Except for the Acharis,
FCM marriages were more frequent
than UN marriages in all caste groups.

The proportion of PFC marriages
varied from 2 per cent in Tamil Brahmins to about 27 per cent in Pillai. It is
interesting to note that Brahmins who
are more stringent in adhering to certain
social norms also showed a small per
cent of PFC marriages. However, it is
not clear how Brahmins compare with
Nadars and Acharis who showed no
PFC marriages.

Of the two types of CFC marriages, a
greater frequency of FSD marriages relative to MBD marriages was found in
the Mudaliar, Tamil Brahmin, and Adi
Dravida caste groups. The Naidu,
Naicker, Chettiar, Nadar, Nair, Achari,
and Yadava caste groups preferred
MBD marriages over FSD marriages.

COEFFICIENT OF INBREEDING

The coefficient of inbreeding (F) was
computed in different caste groups of
Hindus, Christians, and Muslims to be
about 2 per cent, including all populations of Madras. The value of F was 2.2
per cent among Hindus and about 2.1
per cent among Muslims, while it was
only 1.1 per cent among Christians.

Among the caste groups of Hindus,
the value of F varied from 0.2 per cent in
Jains to 3.5 per cent in Achari. Except
for the Pillai where it was 2.9 per cent,
the value of Fin most of the populations
(Naidu, Adi Dravidar, Naicker, Chettiar, and Yadava) was between 2 and 2.5
per cent. Due to small sample size, the
value of F for North Indian Brahmins

DISCUSSION

This study forms an ideal background
for better inbreeding studies in Madras.
One of the most important findings of
the present study is the occurrence of
PFC marriages in appreciable frequencies. They can no longer be treated as
“exceptional,” or “as seen now and
then’? in fishermen and farmers
(Sanghvi, 1956).

Among Muslims, for whom PFC
marriages are perfectly legitimate, the
frequency of abut 59 per cent is not surprising. The fact that the frequency of
PFC marriages is as high as 27 per cent
among some Hindu communities necessitates in-depth studies to elucidate the
forces at work which go against the basic
principles of Dravidian kinship as it has
been understood and propagated by
various authors. Whether such marriages have occurred with or without parental approval or the approval of the
community as such is not a prime factor.
What is significant is to determine the
sociocultural and economic implications
of such marriages and the impact that
such marriages have had and may have
on the kinship structure of the people.

Rao and Inbaraj (1977) also reported
PFC marriages among Hindu rurals and
urbans of North Arcot district, Tamil
Nadu state, as about 2 per cent of all
FCM marriages, but they did not offer
any explanation. In South Indian popu

lations, which show greater preference
for consanguineous marriages, a host of
economic considerations and social factors influence the incidence. Precedence
of parental decision over individual
choice and the necessity of maintaining
harmonious relations within the family
are factors that greatly influence decisions in favor of consanguineous marriages (Dronamraju, 1964; Reid, 1973;
Rao and Inbaraj, 1977). Consanguineous marriages and extended families
were both part of a common proclivity
for wider kinship ties among the Desuri
Kapus of Andhra Pradesh (Govinda
Reddy, 1986). Respondents in that
study offered a variety of reasons, such
as to maintain traditional relationships,
to retain property, to avoid dowry, parental decisions, love, etc., for marrying
a relative. Khuri (1970) demonstrates
that parallel cousin marriage, a wellknown practice in the Middle East, nullifies the effects of marriage on the intensity of family relationships.

In spite of the modern geographic
dispersal of relatives, consanguineous
marriage continues as a cultural practice, as observed in this study from the
high rates of consanguinity irrespective
of the place of birth of the spouses. The
near uniform rates of inbreeding in different age groups of women suggests no
temporal trends in this study, but significant differences in consanguineous
marriages could be observed by religion
and caste.

While consanguineous marriages
continue, seeming to indicate that tradition is overriding education and urbanization, perhaps the frequency of PFC
marriages indicates that urbanization is
resulting in a relaxation of the regulations of Dravidian kinship.
