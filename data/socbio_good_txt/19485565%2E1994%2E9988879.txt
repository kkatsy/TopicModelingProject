ABSTRACT: The Individual Fertility Rate (IFR), a measure of current fertility status in small and
illiterate preindustrial societies, is estimated for five tribal populations from Andhra Pradesh,
India. The Andhra tribes exhibit high individual fertility rates ranging between 49.62 + 1.76
(Konda Dora) and 66.63 + 3.16 (Manzai Mali) and fall in the high-fertility category. The
differences in IFR values between affinal and consanguineous couples are not significant. A
direct positive relation between IFR and tribal hierarchy is observed with relatively higher IFR
values recorded for socially higher-ranked tribes in an ascending order from lower- to higher
ranked groups.

The estimation of fertility rates for
preindustrial societies like tribes is constrained by many factors, such as their
smaller population size, lack of essential data, difficulties in age estimation,
etc. Data for demographic analyses
among tribes are often collected by
ethnographic techniques, such as
household interviews and narrations
which are not always reliable, and in
many cases the information on women’s reproductive histories will be incomplete. Births and deaths are not
formally recorded and maintained by
illiterate tribes, and hence the demographer must make an estimate of age
(Howell, 1979) which may not always
be accurate. The conventional demographic analysis needs accurate ages of
mother and children for computing
age-specific fertility, birth rate, sex ratio, etc. Also, complete reproductive
data of a woman from menarche to
menopause is required for reporting
total fertility and mortality rates.
Hence, data from couples who are still

in their reproductive years and those
who have adopted birth control measures, as well as those who do not remember their ages, can not be included.

Keeping these facts in mind, Hern
(1990) suggested a new measure, the
Individual Fertility Rate (IFR), which
is independent of age and can be used
even if the age of mother is uncertain.
It reflects the intensity of current fertility. The data from women who have
not completed their reproductive cycle
can also be included, and the analysis
can be applied to data on small populations. The IFR, thus estimated, is
suitable to correlate with certain demographic and socio-economic parameters such aS marriage type, income,
social status, etc.

The present paper reports the intensity of current fertility through Hern’s
IFR estimates among five Andhra

tribal populations namely, Bod Mali,

Manzai Mali, Mulia, Dulia, and Konda
Dora. These minor tribes are numeri

cally small with an estimated population size of little less than 2,000 each,
except the Konda Dora whose number
was 142,374 as per ITDA (1981). A
high degree of consanguineous marriages has been reported among these
tribes, and hence an attempt is made to
check whether there is any significant
variation in IFR between consanguineous and affinal couples.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A sample of 657 families belonging
to five tribal groups inhabiting Eastern
ghats of Visakhapatnam district, Andhra Pradesh were surveyed for demographic information. The estimation of
IFR suggested by Hern (1990) requires
simple data regarding the number of
parities and reproductive span of a
woman. Here, parity is defined as the
number of full-term births while reproductive span is defined as the time in
years from first birth to the last. Thus,
IFR is a simple estimate of the current
individual fertility of a woman which is
obtained by dividing parity (P) with
the reproductive span (RS,) and the
fraction multiplied by one hundred
(IFR = P/RS, x 100). The IFR is a
continuous variable, but it may be
made dichotomous by computation of
a secondary variable, FERTCAT,
which separates those categorized as
Low Fertility (FR =0-45) from
those categorized as High Fertility
(IFR = 45+). An IFR value of one
hundred indicates that a woman is delivering a full-term baby every year
during her reproductive span while a
value of fifty means one delivery in two
years, irrespective of number of conceptions. The variability between affinal and consanguineous couples is

tested by applying the t-test between
the mean IFR values.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The range and mean values of parity
and reproductive span among the five
tribal populations are listed in Table 1.
The maximum number of full-term
births reported in the present study of
Andhra tribal women is 14, with a
mean parity of 4.47 + 0.13 per woman
recorded among the Konda Dora population. The Dulia Women register a
lower range of full-term births (2-7)
with a mean parity of 3.35 + 0.12. The
tribes that claim higher social status report lower mean parity compared to
the lower ranked Konda Dora tribe
who have a higher number of children.
Relatively higher values of mean parity
are registered in tribes than castes
(Babu and Naidu, 1989; Mahadevan,
1986). The longest reproductive span,
i.e., twenty-four years after marriage
with a mean period of 10.1 + 0.36
years is found among the Konda Dora.
The shortest mean reproductive period
is 7.53 +0.43 years, recorded among
Manzai Mali women.

The mean values of the individual
fertility rate (IFR) for both affinal and
consanguineous couples are presented
in Table 2. The highest mean IFR
value is 66.63 + 3.16, registered in
Manzai Mali women while the lowest
value is 49.62 + 1.17, recorded in
Konda Dora women. The mean IFR
values of the present study populations
are higher than FERTCAT (45) which
puts them in the high fertility category
(Hern, 1990). The differences in mean
IFR values between affinal and consanguineous couples are not statistically
significant among the five tribes. A
