X-Linkage and Manic-Depressive Illness:

A Reassessment

ABSTRACT: Genetic-epidemiological data and linkage studies with chromosomal markers are
reviewed from the vantage point of X-linked inheritance. The results overall suggest that a gene
predisposing to manic depression (bipolar affective illness) localized on the X-chromosome may
exist in a subgroup of bipolar cases. However, in light of conflicting findings and methodological
uncertainties in studying a disorder with unclear phenotype and complex inheritance, this issue
is not yet closed. Additional research, including new linkage data and extension and re-evaluation of published data, is required to further our understanding of this intriguing hypothesis.

Manic depression, also known as bipolar affective illness, is a severe mood
disorder typified by manic and depressive episodes, variable age of onset
(second to seventh decade of life), and
lifetime prevalence of 0.5 to 1.0 per
cent. The disease can lead to multiple
hospitalizations, impaired psychosocial functioning, suicide, and substance
use (alcoholism and drug abuse). Because of its high population prevalence, it has been dubbed a major public health concern. Somatic therapies
are generally efficacious, but the etiology and pathophysiology of the illness
remain elusive.

Genetic factors have long been implicated in manic depression, as evidenced by family, twin, and adoption
studies: the illness clusters in families;
the concordance rate in monozygotic
twins is higher than in dizygotic twins;
and the risk for affective disorders in
the biological parents of manic depressive adoptees exceeds that found in the
biological parents of normal adoptees
(Gershon, 1990; Baron, 1991). These
observations underscore the role of heredity in manic depression.

Various genetic models have been
proposed, including single gene inheritance; epistasis (interaction between
alleles at different loci); and polygenicmultifactorial transmission. But none
could be concluded to the exclusion of
alternative formulations (Gershon,
1990; Baron, 1991). Among the singlegene hypotheses invoked for manic depression, X-linkage (i.e., the hypothesis that the illness is transmitted
through a gene on the X-chromosome)
appears to enjoy remarkable longevity, since it was proposed over a half
century ago (Rosanoff et al., 1935). In
this paper, I will discuss geneticepidemiological data and chromosomal linkage findings pertaining to
this hypothesis.

GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY

The hallmarks of X-linked dominant inheritance, namely, no male-tomale transmission and an excess of affected women, have been observed in
earlier family and epidemiological
studies. Noteworthy in this regard are
the studies of Winokur et al. (1969)

179

180

and Mendlewicz and Rainer (1974). In
Winokur et al.’s family study, the risk
for female first-degree relatives of bipolar probands was greater than that
for male first-degree relatives, and instances of male-to-male transmission
were not in evidence. Mendlewicz and
Rainer (1974) found that male-to-male
transmission in their series of families
was limited to a small minority of
cases. However, subsequent family
studies have pointed to a more complex pattern of inheritance (Gershon et
al., 1982; Rice et al., 1987), and recent
epidemiological data indicate that bipolar disorder is equally common in females and in males; unipolar major depression, a subset of which is thought
related to bipolar illness, is more common in females, however (Goodwin
and Jamison, 1990).

Comparisons across sexes or across
generations may be markedly biased
due to underlying differences in rates
of illness for these categories. Evidence already exists both for sex and
generational (secular or cohort effects)
differences in the rate of affective disorders (Gershon et al., 1982; Klerman
et al., 1985). For this reason, in examining the hypothesis of X-linkage, it is
advisable to control both for sex and
generation. To do so, Risch et al.
(1986) computed the ratio of risk to a
particular type of relative by sex of
proband and compared these ratios to
predictions made by the X-linkage hypothesis. In addition, they employed
logistic regression and maximum like
~ lihood, allowing for the effects of sex of

relative, sex of proband, generation,
and X-linked transmission. It is important to note that, in view of generation
effects and etiologic heterogeneity,
family data would not yield easily to

Baron

 

Social Biology

traditional types of model fitting, such
as segregation analysis.

In their analysis, Risch et al. used
three large data sets originating from
different centers: a family study conducted in New York in 1968-72 (Mendlewicz and Rainer, 1974); published
family data from a similar study in Bethesda in 1974-79 (Gershon et al.,
1982); and other data compiled from
the literature, as summarized by Gershon et al. (1976). The analysis of risk
ratios by sex of proband showed consistency for the three data sets with the
predictions of X-linked dominant inheritance. The New York and Bethesda studies both suggested the possibility of X-linkage and heterogeneity
within study. The logistic regression results were incompatible with an alternate model for sex difference in affective illness, namely, the sex-specific
threshold model (either single major
locus or polygenic inheritance). According to a threshold model, the relatives of the less frequently affected
sex (males) are at a greater risk for the
illness than the relatives of the more
frequently affected sex (females).
None of the studies fit these predictions. This is consistent with a previous
analysis of the New York data which
did not find a satisfactory fit to the sexspecific single-locus threshold model
(Baron, 1983). Taken together, these
analyses indicate that in all three samples the largest effect is due to
X-linkage. The results also suggest that
X-linked inheritance is present in only
a subset of bipolar illness, i.e., genetic
heterogeneity. In addition, analysis of
the New York data indicates that an
X-linked subgroup may be associated
with early illness onset (before 30 years
old).

CHROMOSOMAL LINKAGE

Genetic marker strategies constitute
a powerful approach in the search for
disease-related genes. Genetic markers are variations, or alleles, at specific
chromosomal loci. The relation of a genetic marker to a putative disease gene
can be determined by linkage analysis.
Linkage refers to the tendency of alleles at separate loci to be co-inherited.
The statistical test criterion is the lod
score, or the logarithm of odds in favor
of the linkage hypothesis. The generally accepted lod threshold for evidence of linkage is 3.0 (the equivalent
of a 1,000:1 ratio between the probability of observing the data given the
hypothesis of linkage and that of observing the data in the absence of linkage). When the lod value is smaller
than —2.0, linkage is rejected. The recombination fraction between the disease locus and the marker locus
(range: 0 to 50 per cent) is indicative of
the map distance between the two loci.
For small recombination values, 1 per
cent recombination corresponds to 1
centiMorgan (cM) in map units.

Linkage studies with X-chromosome markers in manic depression
have been in evidence for nearly two
decades. The results are summarized in
Table 1.

Reich et al. (1969) reported the first
evidence for X-linkage using the
X-chromosome marker color blindness
(CB) in two large North-American bipolar pedigrees. This publication was
followed by other reports. The largest
series of North-American pedigrees
was studied by Mendlewicz and Fleiss
(1974). They concluded close linkage
of bipolar illness to CB in 17 bipolar
pedigrees, and loose linkage to the Xg

Manic-Depressive Illness

181

blood group in 23 pedigrees. Linkage
to CB or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency was reported subsequently in smaller series: a
North-American pedigree (Baron,
1977); 8 Belgian pedigrees (Mendlewicz et al., 1979); an Iranian pedigree (Mendlewicz et al., 1980); and 2
Sardinian pedigrees (Del Zompo et al.,
1984). A more recent study reported
linkage of bipolar illness to CB or
G6PD deficiency in 4 Jewish-Israeli
non-Ashkenazi (i.e., Mediterranean or
Near-Eastern) pedigrees (Baron et al.,
1987). A subsequent analysis, incorporating various phenotypic patterns and
phenocopy probabilities, showed that
the evidence for linkage in these data
could not be ascribed to errors arising
from diagnostic uncertainties (Baron
et al., 1990a). Mendlewicz et al. (1987)
described linkage oof another
X-chromosome marker, a factor IX
(F9) DNA polymorphism, to bipolar
illness in a series of 10 Belgian pedigrees.

Negative linkage reports are also in
evidence. Gershon et al. (1979) reported 6 North-American pedigrees in
which CB was not linked to bipolar illness. Linkage to Xg was excluded by
the same group of investigators who
studied 6 pedigrees drawn from the
same North-American series; 2 of the
pedigrees were also included in their
CB study (Leckman et al., 1979). In
more recent studies, Berrettini et al.
(1990) found no linkage to the DNA
markers F8, DXS52, and DXS15 in 9
North-American pedigrees, and Gejman et al. (1990) ruled out linkage to
F9, DXS98, and DXS105 in the same
pedigrees.

Of the 14 published studies, 10
yielded positive lod scores, ranging

X-LINKAGE AND GENETIC
HETEROGENEITY

Genetic heterogeneity has been offered as one possible explanation for

 

the diverse linkage findings. In common disorders with complex phenotypes and transmission patterns (such
as manic depression), etiologic heterogeneity is an appealing proposition.
Risch and Baron (1982) reanalyzed
published pedigree series and assessed
linkage heterogeneity both by a
Bayesian approach and by a modified
likelihood-ratio test. They estimated
the proportion of X-linked bipolar
pedigrees to be 64 per cent (including
the older studies) or 47 per cent (exVol. 38, No. 3-4

cluding the older studies). They noted,
however, that this estimate 1s likely inflated, given the possibility of selective
publication of pedigrees with positive
evidence for linkage. Also, this estimate is not representative of the population as a whole because pedigrees
with male-to-male transmission are excluded automatically from the analysis.
Hence, the fraction of X-linked cases
‘in the population is much smaller than
<these estimates.
9 Inasubsequent analysis, Risch et al.
(1986), using published risk ratios in
family study data, estimated that 25
per cent of male bipolars may be afCfected due to an X-linked gene. Intersestingly, heterogeneity appeared
“present within as well as among studies
‘Sin these analyses. They emphasized,
however, that these estimates are
merely suggestive and are entirely deendent on the accuracy of the underying assumptions, in particular, peneptrance and the frequency of non-X‘inked forms of the illness in males
2versus females. In the absence of linkage data in the populations studied, the
panalysis was limited to _ genetic¥pidemiological data.
3 It is important to mention that the
apparent heterogeneity in the
-X-linkage data, as reanalyzed by Risch
Pand Baron (1982), was not due to combining ‘‘positive” results from one series of pedigrees with “‘negative’’ ones
from another. Clearly, homogeneous
linkage within some pedigree series in
the face of heterogeneity across studies
might be ascribed to a systematic error
in some of the “positive” studies.
When Risch and Baron reanalyzed
only the pedigree series published by
Mendlewicz and his colleagues, who
provided the bulk of the evidence for
X-linkage in the Risch and Baron anal
Manic-Depressive Illness

183

ysis, heterogeneity was still significant.
The degree of heterogeneity in the
more recent pedigree series with strong
evidence for X-linkage was marginally
significant (Baron et al., 1987).

Baron et al. (1987) suggested that
ethnic differences might account for
some of the apparent heterogeneity in
linkage results. In their series, linkage
was observed in the non-Ashkenazi
pedigrees, but not in the single Ashkenazi (European) family. Evidence
for linkage in other populations of a
similar ethnic background was noted in
earlier studies (Mendlewicz et al.,
1980; Del Zompo et al., 1984). By
comparison, all the negative linkage
results stemmed from populations of a
different ethnic extraction. It should be
acknowledged, however, that not all
pedigrees with evidence for linkage
originated in the same genetic “pool.”
Hence, ethnic differences cannot be
the sole explanation for the inconsistency in linkage data.

The many instances of male-to-male
transmission in manic-depressive illness make it likely that an X-linked
form of the disease would account for
only a minority of cases. Further study
is needed to arrive at a more definitive
statement on this issue.

CRITIQUE OF LINKAGE
RESULTS |

Genetic heterogeneity notwithstanding, the possibility that some of
the published linkage studies were beset by errors deserves scrutiny.

Gershon and Bunney (1976) found
fault with the earliest studies of Mendlewicz and colleagues (Mendlewicz et
al., 1972; Mendlewicz and Fleiss,
1974). They noted the imprecise analytic methods used by these investigaDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:44 08 December 2015

tors and pointed out the conflicting

‘claim of linkage both with CB and with

Xg, two loci which are far apart on the
X-chromosome.

In a reanalysis of these data, Baron
et al. (1981) and Risch and Baron
(1982) addressed some of these issues,
especially as regards ascertainment
bias, method of analysis, genetic heterogeneity, and the X-chromosome
map. Using a systematic method of
pedigree analysis with age-of-onset
correction, they essentially confirmed
the earlier observation of linkage to
CB in some pedigrees, but linkage with
Xg could not be supported. Thus, on
reanalysis, the results were no longer
incompatible with known map distances on the X-chromosome.

The report by Mendlewicz et al.
(1987) of linkage to F9 was criticized by
Suarez et al. (1987) who pointed out
the tenuous nature of the evidence, especially given the impact of delayed illness onset on the diagnostic status of
individuals considered unaffected.
Other potential limitations of the F9
linkage data concern the large map distance between the CB-G6PD loci and
the F9 locus. As noted by Gejman et
al. (1990) and Baron (1991), unless the
F9 linkage represents a second, independent locus for bipolar illness on the
X-chromosome, this finding may be incompatible with the stronger evidence
for linkage to the CB-G6PD region.

More recently, Gershon (1991) revived the debate over Mendlewicz et
al.’s old data on linkage of bipolar illness to CB and Xg (Mendlewicz et al.,
1972; Mendlewicz and Fleiss, 1974).
Gershon argued that CB and Xg appear linked to each other in this series
of pedigrees, and since these markers
are known to be far apart, this points to

 

Social Biology

systematic genotypic errors which cast
doubt on the validity of the original results. In their rebuttal, Mendlewicz et
al. (1991) acknowledged an unintentional source of bias resulting from
preferential ascertainment of doubly
heterozygous females. This selection
mechanism could inflate the evidence
for linkage, especially in small families.
But they also indicated that two unlinked markers, such as CB and Xg,
could show spurious linkage in a limited series of pedigrees due to chance
cosegregation mimicking linkage. (The
linkage between CB and Xg found by
Gershon was of marginal statistical significance.)

The negative linkage reports (Gershon et al., 1979; Berrettini et al.,
1990; Gejman et al., 1990) have also
faced criticism. In his evaluation of
these studies, Baron (19916) suggested
that some of the negative linkage results may be spurious owing to the
inclusion of pedigrees with clear or suspected male-to-male transmission and
assortative mating, circumstances
known to deflate the evidence for linkage. Also, some of the pedigrees were
characterized by low illness density,
and hence were less likely to represent
the genetic form of the illness.

It should also be mentioned that
published pedigree series are fairly
small. Simulation studies have shown
that if the linked form of the illness is
not common (a reasonable proposition
given that the great majority of pedigrees show male-to-male transmission), linkage could be missed entirely
unless the samples analyzed were much
larger than those actually studied (Ott,
1986; Martinez and Goldin, 1989).

In sum, the possibility of Type I
(false claim that linkage exists) and

 
Vol. 38, No. 3-4

Type II (false exclusion of linkage) errors in some of the studies hitherto reported must be considered. However,
assuming no systematic errors (e.g.,
non-blind procedures for the assignment of phenotypes and genotypes),
Type I errors, especially as regards ascertainment bias, cannot account for
the large individual lod scores observed in some of the medium-to-largein sized pedigrees reported to be linked
S to CB or G6PD. To date, seven pedi© grees with lod scores exceeding 2.0
5 have been reported, originating from

A and Baron, 1982; Baron et al., 1987).

+. Type II errors in linkage studies of af= fective disorders appear elsewhere

FUTURE COURSE

Advances in molecular and quantitative genetics, coupled with new inZ sights into linkage analysis of complex
2 disorders, have enhanced the pros> pects of X-linkage studies in manic> depressive illness. These developments
3 can be summarized as follows.
3S  1.—The candidate chromosomal re< gion (Xq27-28) is saturated with DNA
= polymorphisms, including those reA lated to the color vision pigment gene
and to the gene encoding a subunit of
the neurotransmitter y-aminobutyric
acid (GABRA3), a potential candidate
gene for neuropsychiatric disorders
(Davies et al., 1990). These potential
markers have supplanted CB and
G6PD by the sheer force of numbers
and degree of polymorphism. Since
most matings can now be rendered informative for linkage analysis, both the
number of testable pedigrees and the

ty of Michigan

ed b

Manic-Depressive Illness

 

power to detect (or exclude) linkage
will increase.

2.—Inconsistencies with the genetic
map (e.g., the claim of linkage to both
CB-G6PD and F9 loci discussed earlier) can be resolved by multilocus
analysis of markers spanning the distal
long arm of the X-chromosome.

3.—Should linkage to Xq28 be established, existing and newly generated DNA markers could be used to
‘home in” on the putative disease gene
by delineating the smallest obligate region containing the disease locus. This,
in turn, should expedite efforts directed at the isolation and cloning of
the gene itself.

4.—Simulation studies can be conducted prior to marker typing to ensure that the pedigrees under investigation have a high information content
as regards linkage analysis.

5.—As detailed elsewhere (Baron
et al., 1990b; Baron, 1992), safeguards
against spurious linkage results (both
Type I and Type II errors) should be
implemented. These include blind procedures for phenotyping and genotyping; appropriate ascertainment of family material (particularly, exclusion of
male-to-male transmission and assortative mating, and nonselective presentation of all testable pedigrees); reduction of multiple test effects by limiting
the number of diagnostic and genetic
configurations in the linkage analysis;
cautious interpretation of borderline
lod scores and adjustment of lod values
in the event model-dependent “‘inflation” is likely; a focus on the narrowly
defined phenotype (i.e., bipolar I disorder) and on affected individuals
(i.e., a “penetrance-free’’ model) to
reduce the occurrence of phenotypic
misclassification; introduction of quan

titative measurements that grade stability and severity of the psychiatric diagnosis and thus can obviate sporadic
cases and phenocopies (Baron et al.,
1990a); and due attention to laboratory
errors such as sample mixups, nonpaternity and incorrect reading of marker
alleles.

6.—A larger sampling to obviate the
confounding effect of genetic heterogeneity and to increase the power of
linkage analysis.

7.—A search for clinical and biological correlates to sort out homogeneous
subsets of the illness which might be
more amenable to linkage analysis. It
has been suggested, for instance, that
early age of onset and a high density of
bipolar I disorder (as opposed to bipolar II or unipolar depressive disorders)
may characterize the X-linked phenotype (Risch et al., 1986; Baron et al.,
1990a).

8.—In view of the uncertain status
of the putative X-linked gene, a search
for other loci which might act independently or in conjunction with the
X-linked locus (i.e., gene-gene interaction) is in order. Additional polygenic
and/or environmental effects warrant
consideration.

9.—An independent confirmation
in new series pedigrees, using the available (and evolving) molecular and sta
Baron

Social Biology

tistical tools, is called for. In the light
of possible ethnic differences in genetic
patterns, new studies should also focus
on Mediterranean and Near-Eastern
populations. In the interim, to increase
confidence in published linkage results, pedigrees with evidence for
X-linkage should be extended and reevaluated by way of adding new individuals, updating the clinical diagnosis
(a potentially crucial issue in light of
variable age of onset and diagnostic instability over time), and typing additional markers in the region suspected
to be linked to the disease locus.

CONCLUSION

How can we best define the current
state of X-linkage in manic-depressive
illness? It appears that, of the linkages
hitherto reported in affective disorders, X-linked inheritance remains a
viable hypothesis. But diverse findings
and claims of both Type I and Type II
errors in some of the published pedigree series necessitate further inquiry
into this matter.
