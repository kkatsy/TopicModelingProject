ABSTRACT: This paper examines the economic segmentation model in explaining 1985-86
Japanese interregional migration. The analysis takes advantage of statistical graphic
techniques to illustrate the following substantive issues of interregional migration: (1) to
examine whether economic segmentation significantly influences Japanese regional migration
and (2) to explain socioeconomic characteristics of prefectures for both in- and out-migration.
Analytic techniques include a latent structural equation (LISREL) methodology and statistical
residual mapping. The residual dispersion patterns, for instance, suggest the extent to which
socioeconomic and geopolitical variables explain migration differences by showing unique
clusters of unexplained residuals. The analysis further points out that extraneous factors such
as high residential land values, significant commuting populations, and regional-specific
cultures and traditions need to be incorporated in the economic segmentation model in order to
assess the extent of the model’s reliability in explaining the pattern of interprefectural
migration.

to meet the changing economic organizational structure (Baron and Bielby,
1980; Fukurai et al., 1987; Holden,
1973; White, 1982). Second, the model
points out the importance of analyzing
structural factors that affect urban exodus as well, i.e., organizational development, job availability, and the distribution of occupational reward structures.
In general, the explanation of regional
migration patterns analyzes how the intrusion and penetration of modern economic relations into the countryside
triggers waves of rural migrants to receiving states in spite of the fact that
there may be few opportunities in urban
areas (such as jobs and housing) (Castells, 1975, 1983; Danesh, 1987; Henderson and Castells, 1987).! The theoretical tenets of the economic
opportunity and economic segmentation theses are explored more fully in
the next sections.

BACKGROUND
Economic OPpporRTUNITY THESIS

The economic opportunity thesis emphasizes the gap in wage incentives between sending and receiving regions and
assumes an unlimited supply of labor
which ts based on the existence of a permanent, large differential in favor of

thesis (Kalleberg and Griffin, 1980; Kalleberg et
al., 1981; Tolbert et al., 1980; Weakliem, 1990;
Zucker and Rosenstein, 1981). For example, Kalleberg et al. (1981) incorporate the dual economic
theory (core and periphery sectors of different organizations) and dual labor-market theory (primary and secondary labor markets) in order to explain mobility patterns in the United States.

destination. The existence of an unlimited labor supply suggests that the initiation of migration flows depends almost
exclusively on labor demand in receiving states. For example, Lowry’s (1964)
analysis of migration flows used a logtransformed regression model with the
number of migrants from / to j as the dependent variable. As independent variables, Lowry used airline distance from i
(an origin state) to j (a destination
state), for both origin and destination,
percentage of population in the nonagricultural labor force, and manufacturing
wage rate. Rogers (1968) modified the
Lowry model by altering the labor force,
unemployment, and distance variables.
The results for migration flows between
SMSA’s in California showed that migration is particularly related to a high
wage ratio at destination and a large civilian labor force at either origin or destination and negatively related to high
wages at origin and distance between i
and j.

Those early studies paved the way for
migration analysis of many geographical
units utilizing a variety of techniques.
Out of a large body of research, four
studies on Japan are relevant to the
present research (Hanley and Yamamura, 1977; Mosk, 1983; Taeuber,
1958; Vogel, 1967).

Although he did not specifically employ the economic opportunity thesis,
Taeuber (1958) set the groundwork for
research on interprefectural migration
by analyzing Japanese census information between 1920 and 1957. He argued
that the major determinant of rural exodus is “the economic opportunities in
the industrial areas” (Taeuber, 1958, p.
132). For instance, in 1930, fifteen predominantly agricultural prefectures
“had lost more than one-fifth of their
native-born men. These prefectures of

major emigration were intermediate in
industrial structures” (p. 132). Taeuber
further observed that after World War
II, as Japanese industries were restored
and cities reconstructed, the internal migratory movements normal to other industrializing societies reappeared—net
exodus from agricultural areas and net
influx into industrial regions. His analysis showed that internal migration from
1947 to 1957 was much greater than the
migratory move by Japanese settlers
into Manchuria at the beginning of the
war in China. Again, the main force behind the rural exodus and urban influx
was economic opportunities in industrial prefectures (pp. 144-47).

Vogel (1967) also presented similar
perspectives on the explanation of Japanese interprefectural migration. He
pointed out that prior to 1950, in addition to economic opportunities in urban
cities, the landlord in rural regions
played an important role in spatially allocating Japanese rural migrants. Vogel
argued that the success of placing young
workers in cities depended on the assistance from the landlords and their close
relationship to potential employers in
cities who were expected to give on-thejob training to young men with good
general intelligence, reliable character,
and most importantly, a special connection with the employer’s friends or relatives so the employer could be assured
of the employee’s willingness to work
long hours without high wages (p. 95).
Vogel argued that the land ownership,
close kinship networks among peasants
in rural areas, and increased employment opportunities in urban cities
played a crucial role in influencing Japanese rural exodus.”

The economic opportunity thesis is
also used to explain interregional migration in preindustrial Japan, specifically
between 1600 and 1868. Hanley and
Yamamura (1977) argued that economic opportunities were the major determinant of interregional migration before the Meiji Restoration (1868), the
dawn of Japan’s modern industrialization. For instance, while migration between different, politically-defined regions was difficult, migration was a
significant method of shifting population, and political boundaries did not
constitute a real obstacle for persons
who wished to migrate (p. 252). Hanley
and Yamamura’s (1977) analytical contribution on Japanese interregional migration came from the conceptual distinction between permanent and
temporary migration. Temporary migration took the form of individual emigration in that unmarried men and
women typically left their villages to
work in nearby areas. The modal age
groups of hokonin (apprentices) of both
sexes were in the 15-30 age group (p.
254). Also, it was not unusual for heads
of families to leave home by themselves
to work outside their villages in the form
of dekasegi (working away from home).
Permanent migration of families, however, tended to be limited to moves to
areas being claimed or to larger towns
and cities, where some families worked
in samurai households and/or where it
was easier for illegal migrants to escape
detection. Theoretically, for a village
resident to move to a city, two require
persons and customs (Dore, 1967a, pp. 126-27).
Thus, migration was actually controlled by soctal
groups in villages: Those who want urban jobs
must use traditional mediating agencies and the
continuing responsibility of rural sponsors for new
employees’ behaviors and continuous heavy inmigration even into demographic net-loss prefectures indicated the persistence of powerful ties to
the countryside (Vogel, 1963, p. 258).

ments had to be met: The person had to
be poor and without land; and he had to
be unable to undertake hard farm labor
(p. 253). The research pointed out that
because of different levels of economic
prosperity and increased opportunities
among villages, reverse migration from
cities to rural villages was not unusual
(p. 254). For instance, when opportunities existed in noncommercial, rural areas, large cities like Osaka experienced
a decline in the population as the economic fortunes of Osaka began to ebb.
Hanley and Yamamura noted that
“while Osaka’s population grew from
279,000 to 501,000 between 1625 and
1743, it began to fall... . A steady decline in population continued from the
mid-eighteenth century” (p. 106).

Most (1983) examined Japanese migration patterns in the post-industrial
era, specifically between 1880 and 1960.
High fertility ratios and patriarchal and
extended family structures in rural areas
created the structural condition for
greater rural exodus, and the industrial
expansion and increased economic opportunities in urban regions helped absorb unskilled laborers from the predominantly agricultural rural regions.
Mosk’s analysis also pointed out that the
rural exodus was due to a large manufacturing wage differential. The wage
gap played a significant role in determining the overall level of daily remuneration in industrial prefectures where the
contraction of the female-male wage differential was observed (pp. 208-9). He
contended that economic and employment opportunities in industrial prefectures were major factors in promoting
tural-to-urban interprefectural migration.

Past research thus suggests that interregional migration depends substantially upon labor demands and economic opportunities in receiving and

urban regions. When such demand exists, migration takes place. Thus, the economic opportunity thesis deemphasizes push factors to focus on the
pull exerted by receiving economies.

Economic SEGMENTATION THESIS

There has been a paucity of research
examining the relationship between organizational growth and interregional
migration. One of the problems lies in
the prevalent trend in which studies
limit themselves to the influence of economic infrastructures on migration
rather than systematically examining
other pertinent factors.

The economic segmentation theory
rejects the general assumption of an economic opportunity thesis that ruralurban migration is caused primarily by
higher paying jobs and employment opportunities in urban sectors or in destinations. It argues that the impact of differential income between rural and
urban sectors on migration is minimal
because, despite higher per capita income in the cities, rural migrants are
faced with a higher cost of production
and reproduction. The significantly
higher cost of consumption in urban areas than in rural areas is mainly caused
by the demands of the urban economy
(Finkelman, 1989; Henderson and Castells, 1987; Portes and Bach, 1985). For
instance, in rural areas where there is no
spatial segregation between the place of
residence and place of work, there is no
need for public or private transportation. But in cities one has to add the cost
of transportation to the overall domestic
budget (Danesh, 1987).

The analysis of interregional migration from an economic segmentation
perspective suggests that the organizational growth and changes in the structure of industry and agriculture lead to
the development of service and tertiary

sectors in urban regions. The growth of
service sectors then affects the structure
of the occupational reward system and
creates interregional income inequality
(Baron and Bielby, 1980; Fukurai et
al., 1987). The observed disorganization
and breakdown of agrarian society is
primarily due to (1) population growth
as a consequence of the rise in life expectancy, (2) lack of accessibility to
income-generating lands and their distribution, and (3) the interplay between
those two exponents (Castells, 1983;
Portes and Bach, 1985). Thus, the
greater exchange between rural and urban regions under the condition of high
population growth and unproductive
land tenure leads to a high rural exodus
(Connell et al., 1976; Danesh, 1987).
Also the greater differential productivity between rural and urban areas leads
to a greater level of migration from less
productive to more productive sectors
and vice versa.

A meaningful analysis of interregional migration, according to the economic segmentation perspective, arises
when organizational structures and labor market characteristics have simultaneously been taken into consideration.
Since an economic opportunity thesis
focuses primarily on urban economic
factors (or pull) and income inequality
between urban and rural regions affecting interregional migration, it is of great
importance that both organizational and
labor market characteristics in relation
to socioeconomic conditions are systematically examined.

DvuAL LABOR MARKETS

The theoretical tenet of the economic
segmentation thesis is based on the assumption of a dual labor market. That
is, the generation of an oligapolistic segment by which advanced economies
control different facets of production

Social Biology

and commercialization. This control is
far more extensive among postindustrial firms, i.e., the emergence of
oligapolies into primary and secondary
economies (Krooth and Fukurai, 1990).
The primary sector of the economy is
formed by large monopolistic enterprises characterized by bureaucratization of the production process and the
creation of an internal market in that oligapolistic corporations are able to administer an internal labor market because of their size advantage, higher
wages, greater fringe benefits, and more
desirable working conditions (Baron
and Bielby, 1980; Fukurai et al., 1987;
Krooth and Fukurai, 1990; Portes and
Bach, 1985; Smith, 1983). A secondary
sector of the economy comprises smaller
competitive firms and resembles structural conditions during the early phase
of industrial capitalism. Such firms operate in an environment of considerable
economic uncertainty (Baron and
Bielby, 1980; Magnum et al., 1985). Enterprises in this economic sector do not
have an internal labor market. Wages
are lower than in the primary sector and
interregional migrants are considered as
a preferred labor force used against the
organizational efforts of the domesticminority work force to accept present
conditions and to discourage workers’
efforts to improve them (Donoghue,
1978; Wagatsuma and De Vos, 1984).°

3The internal labor market in Japan assumes
that the technique employed by the firm is such
that employees’ skills are formed and transmitted
on the job and in a team context. For instance, in
order to motivate employers and employees to
share the costs of investment in such teamoriented human capital, seniority-related benefits
to employees in the form of seniority wages, retirement compensation, and the like have been developed as devices to retain highly trained workers in
the firms. Without such contrivances, employees
might quit in the middle of their careers, causing
the value of the human capital accumulated within
the firm to be lost permanently (Yamamura and
Yasuba, 1987).

Vol. 38, No. 1-2

In Japan, the firms in the secondary
economic sector often rely on the labor
supply from minority groups. For example, the Burakumin, Okinawans, Koreans, and Chinese are still discriminated
against in housing and employment.
There are 1.2 million Burakumin, 1.2
million Okinawans, 678,000 Koreans,
and 84,000 Chinese currently living in
Japan (Buraku Liberation Research Institute, 1988; Statistics Bureau, 1990).*
Their chances of employment in the
firms in primary economic sectors are
virtually nonexistent because of the
strong ideological emphasis on ethnic
homogeneity and cultural conformity
(Buraku Liberation Research Institute,
1988; Cho, 1987; De Vos and Wagatsuma, 1966; Krooth and Fukurai, 1990;
Wagatsuma and De Vos, 1984). For example, the major enterprises in primary
economic sectors do not hire the Burakumin as permanent lifetime employees. The Burakumin are therefore
blocked from achieving economic security and occupational mobility. As an
example of the social discrimination
against the Burakumin, prospective employers often hire detectives to trace the
lineage of potential employees to ensure
that they are not Burakumin (De Vos,
1973; Donoghue, 1978).

In addition to the Burakumin and
ethnic minorities, there are different
groups, such as the Filipinos, who migrated to Japan and found their primary
employment in secondary economic
sectors. For example, between 1980 and
1986, the number of Filipino migrant
workers tripled, rising from 5,547 to
18,897 workers, and their numbers are

‘The majority of the residents of Korean descent are not Japanese citizens, even though more
than 80 per cent of the current total Korean minority population was born in Japan. The majority of
these born-in-Japan Koreans are second, third,
and fourth generations (Cho, 1987).

still increasing today. The majority of
the migratory workers are, however,
employed in politically weak and less organized secondary economic sectors and
these foreign migrants are used to undercut domestic workers who are themselves politically weak, frequently unorganized, and employed by the most
backward corporations (Krooth and Fukurai, 1990; Statistics Bureau, 1990).>

The development of a dual economy
is also closely related to the proliferation
of service/tertiary occupations. These
low level “‘jobs” are most likely to be
filled by interregional migrants because
of the competitive nature of secondary
segments of economy and a lack of labor
skills by the migrants. As demonstrated
by Japanese minority groups and foreign workers, migrant laborers have little collective bargaining power and the
availability of a potential labor replacement encourages exploitation of unskilled and cheap labor.

Meanwhile, the primary oligapolistic
corporation further develops the complex structure of internal labor markets
in which migrant labor is not crucial for
operation. Oligapolistic labor in a primary Sector is invulnerable to the competition of new migrant workers and
may actually profit from their existence.
Competitive labor, on the other hand, is
pitted against new workers and is frequently replaced by them (Gordon et
al., 1982; Smith, 1983; Weakliem,
1990).

Job opening ratios for firms in both
primary and secondary economic sectors between 1985 and 1987 further accentuate the growing polarization of a
dual economy in Japan. The statistics

SDuring the same period, the increase of other
foreign groups was lower than that of Filipinos.
For example, there were 22,401 U.S. nationals in
1980 and 30,695 in 1986, an increase of 37 per cent
(Statistics Bureau, 1986).

show that the primary economic sector
only employs a small portion of Japanese workers (less than 3 per cent) and
there are unequal distributions of organizational resources among different
prefectures.° The growing polarization
of a dual economy then intensifies structural differences between the primary
and secondary segments of the economy
and perpetuates income inequality between oligapolistic economic laborers
and secondary migrant laborers in the
prefecture. Once the dual economy is
well established, income inequality then
prevails, not only at the destination, but
also at the origin of migrant workers, especially in rural areas. Unequal distribution of the monetary reward structure
then further promotes interregional migration.

The economic segmentation theory
thus provides a different set of theoretical explanations. Economic sectors pave
the path by which migratory labors are
spatially allocated to meet the changing
organizational structure at destination
or urban regions. Once interprefectural
migration prevails, a growing polarization between the two economic segments 1s observed, not only at receiving,
urban areas, but also at origin or rural
regions. A similar trend is expected in
labor market segmentation. Once interprefectural migration has taken
place, the gap between primary and secondary labor markets widens at urban

‘Their prospective employees are mostly unversity graduates and comprised of the ethnic majority (Krooth and Fukurai, 1990; Small and Medium Enterprises Agency, 1988). It is also
important to note that the actual polarization of a
dual economy could have been much greater than
what was reported by the Statistics Bureau in 1990.
This is due to the fact that part-time job openings
and the extent of underemployment conditions in
the Japanese labor force were not included in the
analysis.

 

Social Biology

regions in which the tertiary sector is primarily unorganized and mainly consists
of small and petty commerce and unskilled and temporary labor—a disguised form of unemployment and underemployment.

The main thrust of the remainder of
this paper is two-fold: (1) to provide a
causal model of Japanese interregional
migration based on the economic segmentation thesis, and (2) to examine
critically the empirical model of the economic segmentation thesis in explaining
Japanese interprefectural migration.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Japanese census data for 1985-86 are
utilized to examine the relationship
among the development of economic
segmentation, labor markets, and income inequality, and how the latter affect interprefectural migration. The unit
of analysis is a prefecture. Japan has 47
prefectures and nine regions over four
different major islands: Hokkaido,
Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu.

A problem in studying regional or intranational variations in migration and
economic opportunities in the United
States or other industrialized nations is
the question of the extent to which such
rates are influenced by legal rather than
socioeconomic variables. That is, the
employment opportunities, reward systems, and migratory movements in a geographic area may be influenced by its
legal system as well as its social conditions. For example, in the United
States, regional and state variations in
interstate migration may be influenced
by the fact that some states have less
stringent tax laws than others.

Japan, however, provides a uniquely
advantageous setting for the analysis of
migration. Prefectures, equivalent to
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

Vol. 38, No. 1-2

state units in the United States or provinces in Canada, enjoy social and economic diversity, while the legal system
dealing with tax laws is relatively uniform. While the legal system in Japan is
centralized and uniform, prefectural
units continue to maintain a high degree
of social and economic heterogeneity.
We can therefore eliminate the possibility that the different legal systems and
their enforcement cause variability in interregional migration patterns.

In assessing the application of the economic segmentation model to analyze
Japanese interprefectural migration, we
take advantage of the recent development of covariance structures and
LISREL maximum-likelihood estimations and examine the overall goodnessof-fit test of the segmentation model. By
fitting the model to actual observed data
we systematically examine the economic
segmentation thesis.

The likelihood-ratio, chi-square statistic, and the likelihood-ratio indices
(delta and rho), are employed in comparing fits in order to control for sample
size (Bentler and Bonett, 1980; Bollen,
1989, pp. 271-76). While failure to reject the null hypothesis may be taken as
an indication that the model is consistent with the data, it is important to bear
in mind that alternative models may also
be consistent with the data (Joreskog
and Sorbom, 1985). Moreover, because
the chi-square test is affected by sample
size, it follows that (1) given a sufficiently large sample, an over-identified
model may be rejected even when it fits
the data well; and (2) when the sample
size is small, one may fail to reject the
null hypothesis even when the model fits
the data poorly (Long, 1983; Matsueda
and Bielby, 1986). Therefore, a general
null model based on modified independence among variables is also proposed

Japanese Migration

35

to provide an additional reference point
for the evaluation of the economic segmentation model.’

A hierarchical model-testing strategy
(Bentler and Bonett, 1980) is also used
to derive a final model that not only fits
the data well but fits the data better than
do alternative models. The models specified using this procedure should be
nested, signifying that a more restricted
model contains parameters to be estimated that are a subset of those contained in a less restricted model. Such a
strategy is designed to derive a final
model that adequately reproduces the
covariance matrix with a minimum
number of parameter estimates. Thus,
chi-square difference tests are used in a
hierarchical evaluation strategy to examine the difference in fit of models estimated using the maximum-likelihood
estimation method (Bollen, 1989, p.
263). A significant chi-square difference
test value indicates that a less restricted
model explains a significantly greater
amount of covariation among measures
than does a more restricted model.

migrants at a prefectural level (see Figure 1 for spatial distributions of Japanese interprefectural migration). These
two variables represent overall migration activities in the region and are measured by the percentage of both in- and
out-migrants to the total population.
Past research often relied on the analysis
of net migration patterns, the metric difference between in- and out-migration,
to show the intensity of interregional migration. However, recent studies show
that different regions have varying levels of in- and out-migration and the different clustering patterns for in- and
out-migration streams (Fukurai and Alston, 1990; Fukurai et al., 1988). Research further points out that the use of
net-migration can be misleading since
such an analysis pays little attention to
the difference between in-migration and
out-migration patterns and becomes less
sensitive to unique reciprocal migration
activities among neighboring regions.
Thus, in our analysis, both in- and outmigration streams are utilized to capture
the overall intensity of migration patterns in the region. The variables are
based on 47 prefectures.’
Organizational characteristics are
represented by the average number of
employees in the following three different organizations: (1) wholesale/retail
outlets, (2) finance/insurance companies, and (3) service-related firms. The
service/support organization in tertiary
economic sectors reflects the extent of
regional organizational activities that

the effect of structural variables on vectorized interstate migration streams.

are closely related to interprefectural
migration. The largest employee size for
both wholesale/retail outlets and financial/insurance firms is found in the
Kanto region, where Tokyo is located.

Indicators of labor-market characteristics are designed to reflect employment opportunities and regional labor
force participation. The selected variables include: (1) the per cent of economically active male laborers in the labor
force, (2) the percentage of labor force
in tertiary sectors (i.e., service and support industries), and (3) job opening ratio, i.e., the number of available jobs in
the prefecture divided by the economically active population.

Regional income inequality is also included in the model and assumed to
have a positive relation with interregional migration. That is, the higher the
level of regional income inequality, the
greater the activity of interprefectural
migration. Regional income inequality
is measured by: (1) prefectural income
per capita and (2) per cent Gross Domestic Products (GDP) in tertiary industries. High income per capita is
found in the metropolitan regions such
as Kanto (Tokyo) and Kinki (Osaka).

A number of additional independent
variables are also included in the model
in order to control for extraneous effects: education, residential ownership,
and a number of cities in the prefecture.
Educational levels affect migration activities since they represent the proxy
for labor skills and influence the spatial
distribution of labor force. Educational
levels are measured by: (1) per cent
junior-high-school graduates who advanced to high school and (2) per cent
high-school graduates who advanced to
college. High college admission rates
are found in the southern regions such as

dential ownership also impacts interregional migration, since owners of residential household units are less likely to
move than nonowners. Residential
ownership is represented by: (1) dwelling units occupied (%) and (2) owned
household units (%). Research suggests
that household ownership is relatively
low in the Kanto region because of high
residential land values in Tokyo and its
adjacent cities (Alston and Fukurai,
1990). The absolute number of prefectural cities are also included in the
model in order to account for the extent
of economic opportunities and spatial
allocation of regional migrants. The

 

Social Biology

number of cites may not accurately
reflect the extent of economic opportunities, if cities vary in size between prefectures. However, the 1988 Japanese
census indicates that 553 out of 652 total
Japanese cities (84.8 per cent) had population of 100,000 or less, showing a
small variation in the city populations
(Statistics Bureau, 1990). The largest
number of cities are found in Japan’s
metropolitan regions such as Kanto and
Kinki and significantly influence the
magnitude of Japanese interprefectural
migration. The descriptive statistics for
the structural variables are reported in

In sum, the structural model for Japanese interregional migration from an economic segmentation perspective is indicated by the following seven structural
variables: (1) interprefectural migration, (2) organizational structures, (3)
labor market characteristics, (4) income
inequality, (5) education, (6) residential
ownership, and (7) a number of cities in
a given prefecture. The basic theoretical
tenet of the economic segmentation
model is depicted in Figure 2.

RESULTS

The economic segmentation model
of interprefectural migration in Japan is
examined in Table 2. As the chi-square

served relationship among structural
variables (280.51 X* with 72 degrees of
freedom and p < 0.05). One way to improve the original model and to fit better
the observed covariance matrix is to respecify the measurement model (Bollen, 1989; Joreskog and Sorbom, 1985).
The original model in Figure 2 is respecified by allowing unique factor loadings
of observed indicators to be correlated.
Respecification of the measurement
model by allowing correlations among
unique factors is important because the
unique factor correlation allows the statistical control over possible unreliabilities of observed indicators (Joreskog
and Sorbom, 1985). It thus enhances the
better fit of the model by providing
more feasible relationships between observed indicators and their structural

constructs in the measurement model
(Model 1b). Respecification of the
model further suggests the potential
linkage between one of the indicators
for organizations (i.e., the average number of employees for service-related
firms) and the latent construct of Japanese labor markets (Model 1c). Thus,
Model 1d is generated and significantly
reduces the disparity between reproduced (expected) and observed covariance matrices. That is, Model 1d explains 80.9 per cent of chi-square values
and 75.4 per cent after the degrees of
freedom are taken into consideration.
Looking for a parsimonious model
with conceptual clarity, we compare and
examine different respecified models in

Social Biology

Table 3. Using hierarchical model testing procedures, we generate differences
in both chi-squares and degrees of freedom to examine if the respecified model
is acceptable. While all the chi-square
values appear to be statistically significant, the differences in two indices,
delta and rho, show the largest values
when compared with Model 1d. This
finding suggests that respecified models
significantly improve when compared
with Model 1d. Thus, Model 1d is selected as the best empirical model and
the structural relationship among the latent constructs as well as the measurement relation between the latent factors
and observed indicators is critically examined.

Reliability coefficients for observed
indicators, regression weights of latent
constructs, and their inter-factor correlation coefficients are reported in Tables
4 and 5. There are several notable findings from the measurement model in
Table 4. First, a positive factor loading
for in-migration (0.831) suggests that
prefectures with high in-migration are
also characterized by high outmigration, i.e., significant reciprocal migration patterns among Japanese prefectures.” Reciprocal interprefectural
migration indicates that rural-to-urban
migration no longer characterizes today’s Japanese migration patterns. For
example, in 1988, less than 1 per cent of
the population lived in communities of
fewer than 5,000 persons, suggesting
that little rural population was left to
move out (Statistics Bureau, 1990).

Research points out that rural-tourban migration was the predominant
form of population distribution only until the 1970’s. For instance, after the
war, the changes in both legal and political factors contributed to the significant
migratory flow to urban regions. The
power of landlords was substantially reduced, and they were totally eliminated
as a class in the late 1940’s, freeing numerous tenants tied to the land by debt.
The official anti-urban ideology of the
wartime regime was also discredited.
The growth of labor unions in the 1950’s

°The factor loading for male in-migration was
set to 1.0 in order to eliminate scale indeterminacy
and to obtain unique solutions for the empirical
model of Japanese economic segmentation (Long,
1983). However, the standardized solution for
some observed indicators became larger than the
unity because of the poor fit of the theoreticallyderived expected covariance matrix to the observed covariance matrix (0.753 and 0.808 for
delta and rho, respectively). This finding suggests
that important potential extraneous factors for interprefectural migration might not have been included in the segmentation model.

Japanese Migration 41

and 1960’s promised better conditions
for workers and promoted interprefectural migration to urban industrial regions (Ishida, 1966; White, 1982). In addition, a substantial difference between
agricultural and nonagricultural wages
and the concentration of Japan’s revived
industries in urban areas led to a postwar migratory flood from rural to urban
areas (Kurasawa, 1967).

In the 1970’s, however, net inmigration to urban regions began to decline. At the same time, neighboring
prefectures to the urban regions became
the fastest-growing areas (White, 1982).
The so-called J-turn migration movement into the urban centers and thence
out to neighboring prefectures became
the successor to earlier rural-to-urban
migration (Glickman, 1979). In addition, the economic growth of tertiary
sectors was observed not only in the metropolis such as Tokyo and Osaka, but
in the neighboring regions as well
(Krooth and Fukurai, 1990; White,
1982). Thus, the direction of today’s
Japanese interprefectural migration is
no longer from rural to urban regions.

As the analysis suggests, the migration pattern is becoming more and more
reciprocal, reflecting both interdependency of prefectural economic sectors
and the overall development of the secondary segment of the economy in Japan. For example, between 1985 and
1986, migrants from outside prefectures
constituted 4.11 per cent of the total
population in Tokyo. During the same
period, almost the same number of people emigrated from Tokyo to outer prefectures (4.14 per cent). Similar patterns
were observed in other prefectures as
well (for instance, a Pearson correlation
coefficient between 1985 and 1986 inand out-migration patterns is 0.795 and
p<0.05). The growth of service/

support firms in the tertiary sector, thus
significantly relies on interregional migrants as a primary source of unskilled
labor. In addition, both economic and
geographical barriers between prefectures no longer represent the major obstacle for migration. For instance, Japanese interprefectural migration was
further facilitated by highly developed,
efficient transportation networks and
significant urbanization processes since
the end of World War II (Krooth and
Fukurai, 1990).

Table 5 shows the structural relationship among the latent constructs in the
economic segmentation model. Organizational characteristics are examined in
relation to different economic sectors.
The labor market ts also examined in relation to different labor-force characteristics. The structural relationship among
the latent constructs shows mixed
results. First, the organizational growth
in tertiary sectors significantly increases
the regional economic activity (0.228),
suggesting that the growth of economic
sectors in financial, commercial, and
service industries leads to the high level
of economic wealth and prosperity. Second, labor-market characteristics are
found to show the significant direct impact on interprefectural migration. That
is, the greater the proportion of males in
the labor force and the higher the laborforce participation in tertiary segments
of the economy, the greater the intensity
of interprefectural migration (0.254).
This finding further substantiates that
tertiary economic sectors significantly
rely on interregional migratory workers
as the primary source of unskilled labor.

Education is also found to influence
interprefectural migration. The effect
on migration is negative (—0.331), suggesting that the greater the proportion
of students advancing to high schools for

Social Biology

a given prefecture, the less the activity
of interprefectural migration. This relationship also implies that prefectures
with a small proportion of high-school
graduates are more likely to require the
large inflow of regional migrants as potential employees in the tertiary sector
of the economy.!° For example, in
March, 1987, out of 458,000 jobs available, employment opportunities in the
primary economic sector only represented 8,000 jobs (.e., 2 per cent of the
entire job openings), and the secondary
economic sector accounted for the rest
of employment opportunities (Small
and Medium Enterprises Agency,
1988). Thus, for people of lower education, unstable secondary labor markets
and economic shifts in production location are conducive to a high level of interprefectural mobility as these people
search for steady employment (Krooth
and Fukurai, 1990). White (1982)
pointed out that migrants to Tokyo
comprised roughly two-thirds of bluecollar occupational categories in manufacturing and service sectors. He also
observed that migrants accounted for 43
per cent of white-collar office personnel
in both the private and public sectors
and 54 per cent of the managerial executive and technical/semiprofessional oc
10An important concern in using aggregate information in explaining interprefectural migration
is that of the ecological fallacy. The explanation of
behavioral variations such as divorce, using the aggregate information, requires certain assumptions
of the linkage between behavioral and areal phenomena. Many theoretical assumptions of the economic opportunity thesis, for instance, deal with
behavioral aspects of migration, while the economic segmentation model is concerned with the
areal and/or spatial variations of migration. However, the use of aggregate information is more useful in explaining regional variations of migration
since the economic segmentation model takes into
consideration the socioeconomic and demographic factors that pre-exist before migration.

cupational groups. His analysis further
substantiated that 71 per cent of the migrants surveyed had nine years of education or less (p. 78). The important notion here is that today’s Japanese
interprefectural migration plays an important role in supplying unskilled labor
to the secondary segment of the economy.

With regard to other control factors,
residential characteristics and number
of cities for a given prefecture are not
found to be significant predictors of interprefectural migration after the structural factors of economic segmentation
are taken into consideration.

RESIDUAL ANALYSIS

While Japanese economic segmentation explains interprefectural migration,
several shortcomings of the current
model need to be examined. First, our
unit of analysis is the individual prefecture, while migration can be examined
at either regional levels (e.g., Tohoku or
Kanto regions where Tokyo and other
metropolitan prefectures are assumed
to form a single geographic region) or
intra-prefectural levels (e.g., counties of
respective prefectures). The analysis at
the county level might be ideal; however, such detailed information has not

A second problem is the relative lack
of fit of the economic segmentation
model to the observed covariance matrix. Our original model did not fit the
observed relationship among structural
variables (280.51X? with 72 degrees of
freedom and p < 0.05). Respecification
of the measurement model was performed by allowing unique factor correlations which improved the goodnessof-fit of the original model. However,
the model still needs further respecification to improve the fit of expected covariance matrices to an observed covariance matrix. This lack of fit with
unexplained chi-square values suggests
that all the causal variables of interpre
fectural migration were not included in
our theoretical model.

One of the most effective ways to examine possible effects of other extraneous variables is to spatially display the
residual of interprefectural migrants by
controlling for the structural variables in
the model, that is, unique Japanese migration patterns can be observed by examining the spatial distribution of unexplained residuals for migrants in each
prefecture.

Figure 3 shows the residual distribution of interprefectural migration and
suggests two key findings. The first finding is the effect of different regional
characteristics on migration activities
and the model’s over- and underestimation of interprefectural migraDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

tion. Table 6 gives the model’s residual
values for interprefectural migration in
47 prefectures and nine regions. Not
only is there variation between different
regions, but there are migration differences within the regions as well. For example, the economic segmentation
model overestimated the migrants in
three prefectures with the largest negative residuals (Hokkaido, Toyama, and
Okinawa for both in- and outmigration). The economic segmentation
model also underestimated the migrants
in three prefectures with the largest positive residuals (Saitama, Chiba, and
Kanagawa for in-migration and
Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa for outmigration). The interesting finding here
is that those underestimated migration
activities are observed in the Kanto re

gion (0.59 and 0.55 for standardized residuals for in- and out-migration) and
prefectures with underestimated migration are all adjacent to the most economically active prefecture in Japan,
i.e., Tokyo.

There are two reasons for the significant underestimation of migratory patterns in metropolitan regions. First,
high residential land prices in metropolitan regions pushed the large number of
the prefectural population to outer regions. For example, Tokyo has the highest average residential land price, i.e.,
$6,795 per square meter in 1988. Similarly, Osaka is characterized by the second highest residential land price
($1,615 per square meter) (Statistics Bureau, 1990). As a result, significant population decrease in some urban centers

and population increase in the adjacent
prefectures was observed. For instance,
while Tokyo has experienced moderate
population increase between 1980 and
1985 (1.8 per cent), the neighboring prefectures showed a significant population
increase (5 per cent or more).

A second factor in the underestimation of migration patterns in metropolitan regions is the significant number of
commuting populations going from urban centers to neighboring regions. For
instance, in 1985, two prefectures,
Saitama and Kanagawa, sent approximately one million daily commuters to
neighboring prefectures, mostly to Tokyo (Statistics Bureau, 1990). While
high land prices in Tokyo and other metropolitan regions forced many workers
to live in the neighboring prefectures,
the metropolis is still able to retain its labor force through the efficient commuting facilities and transportation networks (Glickman, 1979; Norbeck, 1978;
Umesao et al., 1986; White, 1973).

Another notable finding is the interprefectural variation among and
within islands such as Hokkaido and
Okinawa. Inter-island migration variations suggest that extraneous variables
other than dual economic sectors or

labor-market characteristics need to be
incorporated in the model to explain the
larger variance of the unexplained interprefectural migration pattern. For
example, Kepart (1966) and Leslie
(1976) suggest that the existence of a
frontier tradition in the American West
characterized by rootlessness and nonconformity is partly responsible for
unique migration and behavioral patterns in the West compared to the East.
We concur with this hypothesis, except
that in Japan, the ‘“‘frontier” seems to be
found in its rural areas rather than elsewhere, especially in its northern
(Hokkaido) and southern islands
(Okinawa). Thus, our empirical model
needed to incorporate the extraneous
variables such as residential land values,
commuting populations, and regionalspecific cultures and different traditions
in order to enhance the explanatory
power of the economic segmentation
model. :

CONCLUSIONS

This paper examined the economic
segmentation model in explaining interregional migration in Japan. The analyses suggested that the growth of a labor

market played an important role in influencing the magnitude of interprefectural migration. The findings also suggested that the migration pattern was
becoming more and more reciprocal,
and rural-to-urban migration no longer
characterized today’s Japanese migration patterns. Education was also found
to influence interprefectural migration
in that prefectures with a small proportion of high-school graduates were more
likely to rely on the large inflow of regional migrants, and the migratory
workers became important potential
employees for the secondary segment of
the economy. Furthermore, the residual
analysis of the economic segmentation
model identified the prefectures with
the largest residual dispersions and suggested that high residential land values,
significant commuting populations, and
regional-specific cultures and traditions
need to be incorporated in the model in
order to assess the extent of the model’s

reliability in explaining the pattern of
Japanese interregional migration.
