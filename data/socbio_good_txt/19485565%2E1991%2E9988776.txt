Effect of Infertility on the Population Structure
of the Herero and Mbanderu of Southern Africa

ABSTRACT: Analysis of the fertility of Herero and Mbanderu pastoralists of the northern
Kalahari Desert of Botswana indicates that they have suffered from infertility. The smoothed
population pyramid constructed from a recent census shows waves of births occurring about
every 22 years. Since generation times in human populations are typically longer, we suggest
that infertility is responsible for prematurely terminating the reproductive spans of women,
resulting in a reduced generation time. The eigenvalues of a series of Leslie matrices indicate
that the periods of oscillation in the population have increased from 22 to 29 years following the
recovery from infertility. Increases in fertility since the 1950’s have also transformed the Herero
from a slowly declining population to one growing at a rate of nearly 3.5 per cent per year.

The Herero and Mbanderu are
Bantu-speaking pastoralists who live in
dispersed homesteads in the Kalahari
desert of northwestern Botswana in
southern Africa. Analysis of their fertility from a recent survey indicates that
they have undergone a dramatic transition from low to high fertility in the last
half of this century. In the last three decades, the total fertility rate has increased
from 2.65 to 7.02 (Pennington and Harpending, 1991). The cause of low fertility was probably sterilizing diseases in
women, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, which declined in frequency following the introduction of antibiotics in
northwestern Botswana in the 1950’s
(Dam and Molosiwa, 1987).

The population pyramid constructed
from the survey suggests that there is a
wave of births about every 22 years.
Since generation times in human populations are typically longer, and since
the period of a wave in a population approaching stability is approximately one
generation long, we suggest that infectious infertility is responsible for reducing generation time and, consequently,

127

the mean age of childbearing in this population. We estimate generation time
using the eigenvalues of four Leslie matrices which encapsulate the transition
from very low to very high fertility
schedules in this population. In the
course of the analysis, traces of history
embedded in the shape of the pyramid
are revealed as well as the marked effects of the recovery from infertility on
present-day population growth rates.

BACKGROUND

The Herero and Mbanderu are two
closely related Bantu tribes of Hererospeaking peoples in southern Africa,
collectively referred to herein as Herero. In Botswana most of them are the
descendants of refugees who fled Namibia during the Herero-German War of
1904-07. The exact number of Herero
in Botswana is unknown. Tlou (1985)
uncovered figures estimating that 5001,500 refugees settled in Botswana as a
result of the war. Alnaes (1989) cites
sources in which 200-300 refugees were
counted in Ghanzi District and 1,500

were counted in the Batawana Reserve,
so that the numbers of refugees would
be upwards of 1,700-1,800. Although
the population of Botswana is no longer
enumerated by ethnic group, in 1946,
5,798 Herero were counted in Botswana
(Research Publications, 1973). Since
these figures imply extraordinarily high
annual growth rates of at least 2.8 per
cent, the number of refugees probably
has been underestimated. In fact, the
results of the analysis in this paper indicate that actual population in the first
half of the century was nearly stationary.
Today there are probably 10,00015,000 Herero living in Botswana, comprising about 1 per cent of the total population.! Most of them live in
Ngamiland, the northwest district of
Botswana. According to Almagor
(1982), there were 5,000 Mbanderu living around Lake Ngami, a dry lake at
the tip of the Okavango Delta that occasionally fills from overflow of the Delta
during its annual flooding. Although
Lake Ngami is considered the Mbanderu heartland, this estimate excludes
Herero proper also living around the
lake as well as Herero and Mbanderu
living in other areas of Ngamiland.
Outside of this district, we knew of settlements of several hundred Herero in
Ghanzi, Mahalapye, and Rakops.
Wilmsen (1982) estimated that there
were 15,000 Herero living in remote areas of Botswana, but this estimate may
be too high. If the 1946 census figure is
correct, the population growth rates estimated below indicate that there were
about 12,000 Herero in Botswana in
1986. In this study, we ascertained
about 3,500 Herero, most of whom live
in Ngamiland.

1941 ,027 persons were counted in the 1981 Botswana population census (Central Statistics Office,
1981).

Social Biology

The analysis below is based on 611
maternity histories collected between
1987 and 1989 from Herero living in dispersed homesteads west of the
Okavango Delta and around Lake
Ngami in the northern Kalahari Desert.
Because the climate is semi-desert,
much of northwestern Botswana is waterless and uninhabited. Around Lake
Ngami, population density ranges from
1 to 10 persons per square kilometer but
is less than 0.1 persons per square kilometer in most of the areas included in
this study (Central Statistics Office,
1981). Most Herero live in mud houses
without electricity or running water and
make their living from cattle. Goats,
sheep, and other small stock and occasional gardening supplement this subsistence base. In Botswana, Herero are
considered prosperous cattle farmers.
Most are adequately provisioned, and in
fact they frequently suffer from obesity
(O’Keefe et al., 1988). Consequently,
the low fertility rates described in this
paper are not attributable to undernutrition.

We interviewed adult Herero intensively about their families to obtain the
years of birth and death, if deceased, of
their children, spouses, parents, and
other relatives. Altogether, we ascertained approximately 3,500 living individuals. Of these, we obtained years of
birth of more than 2,700 Herero. Most
of the maternity histories were recorded
from women reporting about themselves. A few histories of deceased or
absent women were provided by husbands or mothers if their accuracy could
be confirmed by other sources. Because
individuals were ascertained in a number of ways, this type of sampling has the
potential to be biased in complex ways.
For example, young children usually entered our database only if one of their

parents was ascertained, while adults
were ascertainable through parents,
children, and spouses. However, for
reasons described more explicitly elsewhere (Harpending and Pennington,
1991a), we have assumed the individuals
we ascertained to be arandom sample of
the Herero population in Botswana.
The dates of most vital events were
reported in either European calendar
years or using traditional year names.
Few Herero knew the Gregorian year in
which an event occurred if it occurred
less recently than about 1960, but most
were able to date earlier vital events using a Herero or Mbanderu year name.
Each year name typically reflects some
important event occurring in that year.
Since the name of the year in which an
individual is born becomes a part of that
person’s identity, nearly every individual knows the name of his or her year of
birth. Several year lists have been sequenced and aligned with Gregorian
years. Lists published in Almagor
(1980) and Vedder (1966) and supplemented by knowledgeable Herero we
met were used to date the years of vital
events reported to us in Herero and
Mbanderu year names. Although there
is some disagreement among sources
about the correct sequence of some
years, and although some error is introduced due to Herero years beginning
and ending with the rainy season (usually in November or December), the use
of Herero year names produced consistent dating of the years in which births
and deaths occurred. In addition, this
method is not biased by common problems of age estimation found in studies
of other populations, such as age heaping on multiples of five (Brass, 1963).
Further details on the sampling and
methodology used in this study can be

pending and Pennington (1991a). The
compiled year list we used to date vital
events is in Pennington (1990).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
AGE-SPECIFIC FERTILITY

Pockets of low fertility occur
throughout Africa, and the causal relationship between subfertility and venereal infection in sub-Saharan Africa has
been examined by Caldwell and
Caldwell (1983) and Frank (1983). Fertility rates among Herero began increasing in the mid-1950’s, and the correspondence between these increases in
fertility and the widespread use of antibiotics in rural northwestern Botswana
(Dam and Molosiwa, 1987) implicates
infectious infertility as the causal agent
there as well. Apart from the !Kung
Bushmen, who have an average of 4 to §
live births at the end of childbearing
(Howell, 1979; Harpending and Wandsnider, 1982), this study is one of the first
to describe subnormal fertility in a
southern African ethnic group. It may
be significant that the !Kung described
by Howell, Harpending, and colleagues
reside among Herero, who frequently
employ them as cattlehands.

The transition from low to high rates
of fertility experienced by Herero
women is illustrated in Figure 1, which
shows the age-specific fertility rates for
three 10-year periods and for the period
1909 to 1956 (from Pennington and Harpending, 1991). These rates were calculated from a total of 12,774 person-years
and 1,921 live births from the 611 female
reproductive histories. Fertility among
women of all ages is lowest in the earliest
period, with a total fertility rate (the
sum of 5 times the age-specific fertility
rates) of only 2.65. An increase in fertil

ity rates in the period 1957-66 illustrates
the initiation of the gradual recovery
from infertility, resulting in a total fertility rate of 7.02 for the most recent period, 1977 to 1986. The low fertility rates
are probably due to the sequelae of venereal diseases leading to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), causing early sterility in many women (Pennington and
Harpending, 1991). The incidence of
PID would decline as more women received antibiotic treatments that became available in rural Botswana in the
1950's.

The increase in fertility in the last half
of this century is unusually dramatic.
When estimates of fertility are based on
retrospective reports, the possibility
that older women are underreporting
their numbers of births must be considered. Several lines of evidence indicate
that estimates of fertility are not biased

by older women ‘‘forgetting”’ their
births or by underreporting of deceased
offspring. First, women with low fertility report their births as occurring while
young. If women underreport their
births due to memory lapse, they should
be more likely to forget offspring born
earlier in reproduction than those born
later in reproduction because recent
events should be better remembered.
Secondly, older women report higher
mortality among their young than younger women (Harpending and Pennington, 1991a) so that underreporting
of deceased offspring cannot account for
the increase in fertility. Moreover, offspring born to women early in reproduction are older and therefore more likely
to be deceased than offspring born later
in reproduction. However, older
women preferentially reported their
births as occurring early in reproduction

so that, again, there is no evidence to
suggest underreporting of deceased offspring in these data. The secondary sex
ratio is also near unity, indicating that
Herero are not preferentially reporting
births of one sex more than the other.
Finally, when the fertility of women giving birth in the first period (1909-56) is
separated into narrower time periods,
the age-specific fertility rates are about
the same. The fertility rates of women
reproducing in 1909-56 have been combined in this analysis due to data sparseness at older ages.

PARITY PROGRESSION RATIOS

While the changes in age-specific fertility rates illustrate the damping effect

131

of infectious infertility on fertility rates,
the onset of secondary sterility is illustrated by the parity progression ratios
(PPR’s) in Figure 2 (from Pennington
and Harpending, 1991). This figure is
based on fertility histories of 239 postreproductive women (women at least 45
years old in 1986). The first data point of
the graph (i = 0) is at about 0.85, indicating that about 85 per cent of the women
in this sample had at least one live birth.
This primary infertility of 15% is high
compared to most natural fertility populations in which rates of 2-3 per cent are
considered normal (Bongaarts and Potter, 1983). However, it is low compared
to many of the populations comprising
the African infertility belt described by

Frank (1983), in which primary infertility rates were often as high as 40 per
cent.

The rest of the data points on this
graph show the proportion of women
who, having had an ith birth, progress to
have an i+ 1th birth. The next data
point at i= 1 is the proportion of
women who, having had at least one
birth, go on to have at least one more.
The PPR’s are around 0.75 for ratios 1
through 12 (corresponding to i=
1,2,3,...,12), after which they rapidly
decline. The PPR of 0.75 indicates that
about 25 per cent of all women become
sterile after giving birth. This means that
a woman of “proven fertility” is more
likely to be sterile than a woman who
has never given birth, since she has
about a 25 per cent chance of being sterile compared to a nulliparous woman
whose chance is only about 15 per cent.

The general shape of the Herero parity progression ratio curve indicates the
nature of reproduction in this population. PPR curves that are concave
downwards are characteristic of “‘natural’’ fertility populations (Howell,
1979), meaning that factors affecting the
level of fertility in Herero are not
strongly correlated with parity. In contracepting populations, these curves
tend to be concave upwards as most
women terminate childbearing at lower
parities. Although the Herero PPR’s appear to be relatively constant across
parities, the jump at progression i = 5
suggests that there may be heterogeneity in the level of fertility in this group
of women.

POPULATION STRUCTURE

lation’s history. Figure 3 (taken from
Harpending and Pennington, 1991a) is
the smoothed age-sex distribution of
2,291 individuals ascertained by us in
1987-89. This pyramid is representative
of the living population in 1986. The top
of the pyramid is fairly narrow but begins widening at the wave of births occurring about 20 to 30 years ago. The
narrow structure of the pyramid at older ~
ages is characteristic of a low fertility
population, and the broadening and tapering of its shape initiated about 30
years ago coincides with the increase in
fertility tates. Narrow population pyramids are also associated with populations with very high mortality, but this
pattern does not describe the Herero,
who have an expectation of life at birth
of at least 50 years (Harpending and
Pennington, 19915).

Without smoothing, the population
pyramid based on the raw data used to
generate: Figure 3 is rough, jagged, and
uninformative. Traditionally, demographers have collapsed these kinds of erratic data series into 5-year age-classes.
This technique has the advantage of
minimizing noise in population data,
but, by the same token has the disadvantage in that it may also eliminate pattern. The pyramid in Figure 3 has been
smoothed using a 4253H filtering algorithm recommended by Velleman and
Hoaglin (1981). This algorithm illustrates pattern in the population structure but does not create an artificial
wave.

The purpose of smoothing is to generate hypotheses, and a variety of them
are suggested by the pyramid in Figure
3. First, the pyramid is asymmetric in
that bulges on the female side of the pyramid appearing in the mid 1920’s,
1940’s, and 1960’s are not as conspicuous on the male side. These apparent
“‘missing males” suggest that male mor

tality may be excessively high in this
population, and in fact males do experience about three times the risk of mortality in infancy and about two times the
risk of mortality in childhood relative to
females (Harpending and Pennington,
1991a). Although this level of sexbiased mortality is unusually high, its
cause is unknown.

This smoothed pyramid also shows
an apparent wave originating early in
the century, that is, among the oldest individuals in this sample. The wave is
probably a result of the Herero population in Botswana being founded by a disproportionate number of young people
following the flight from Namibia at the
turn of the century. Figure 4 is a redrawing of a population pyramid constructed
by Gordon Gibson based on a 1953 census of the Herero (Gibson, 1959). The
individuals born in the years 1903 to
1868 in this pyramid represent the proportions of individuals who were aged 0

to 40 in 1903, when the refugee Herero
population was founded. The age range
represented encompasses most of the female reproductive span, and since a relatively small proportion of individuals
of reproductive age founded the Herero
population, a surge of births would follow as the refugee population matured.
This birth surge would be echoed in subsequent generations. Although Gibson’s sample is small, his pyramid is
characterized by the same pinches and
bulges suggested by the pyramid in Figure 3. Consequently, there is a greater
basis for accepting Gibson’s pyramid as
representative of the age structure of the
Herero of Botswana in 1953. Gibson’s
pyramid is also similar in shape to population pyramids of the Herero of Namibia constructed about the same time
(Kohler, 1959a, b,c), suggesting that the
age-structure in both Herero populations reflects excessive subadult mortality during the war.

GENERATION TIME AND THE
LENGTH OF WAVES

Natural periodicity is normal in human populations such that the wave resulting from a perturbation has a period
about equal to the length of one generation (Keyfitz and Flieger, 1971; Keyfitz,
1972; Coale, 1972). That is, given a fixed
set of fertility and mortality rates, a
surge of births occurring at a particular
point in time will be echoed a generation
later when the excess births mature to
reproduce themselves. Thus, the length
of the period W, is approximately equal
to the generation time T (Keyfitz, 1968;
Caswell, 1989), where T is the number
of years a population growing at a rate r
will increase by a factor of the net reproduction rate (VRR), and the NRR is the
expected number of baby girls born toa
newborn female (e.g., Keyfitz and
Flieger, 1971). Generation time can be
derived from Lotka’s renewal equation
(Keyfitz and Flieger, 1971) in which
exp’? = NRR so that T = In ( M88) T

has been shown to be equal to the mean
age of childbearing » (Keyfitz and
Flieger, 1971; Coale, 1972). Since the
length of the generation time reflects the
age at which reproduction is concentrated, populations with longer generation times have reproduction concentrated at older ages compared to
populations with shorter generation
times (Coale, 1972). The correlation between 7 and p indicates that the average
mother in populations with longer generation times will be older than in those
with shorter generation times, and it follows then that, all things being equal,
the average grandmother must be younger as well.

A study of the female side of the Herero population pyramid in Figure 4 indicates that the length of the apparent
wave is unusually short. Troughs in the
apparent wave appear about every 22
years, several years shorter than calculations for most populations given in
Keyfitz and Flieger (1971). Since the
length of a wave is generally longer in
human populations, the short wave

length in the smoothed pyramid suggests that shortened reproductive spans
resulting from venereal infection during
the first half of the century may be responsible for increasing the frequency of
oscillation in the pyramid and, consequently, for reducing generation time
and the mean age of childbearing in this
population.

THE LESLIE MODEL

The length of a population wave can
be derived from its Leslie matrix (e.g.,
Keyfitz and Flieger, 1971). The eigenvalues of a Leslie matrix have their analogues in the Lotka equation such that
In \, = r, where ), is the dominant eigenvalue of the matrix. Fori > 1, the A;
are complex so that their relationship to

the roots 7; in the Lotka model are not —

one-to-one (Keyfitz, 1968). Rather, the
frequency of the natural periodicity is

To test the hypothesis that infertility has
reduced the frequency of oscillation in
the Herero population, we analyzed a
series of Leslie matrices in order to identify temporal changes associated with increases in fertility. Four Leslie matrices
were constructed using the four sets of
fertility schedules calculated from the
age-specific fertility rates in Figure 1.
These are given in Table 1. The subdiagonals are the probabilities P; of surviving from the ith to i + 1th age class.

their flight to Botswana, the Herero
population was slowly declining at a rate
of about 0.15 per cent per year. The intrinsic rate of population growth became positive following the recovery
from infertility initiated in the mid1950s, and cutrently appears to be growing at a rate of nearly 3.5 per cent per
year.

in the population has increased from a
low of 21.6 in the first period to 22.5 in
the first 10-year period of recovery from
infertility, to over 29 years in the last two
decades. Comparisons with populations
in Keyfitz and Flieger (1971) suggest
that frequencies of less than 25 years are
unusual. Of the populations studied,
those with the shortest generation times
tended to have low growth rates, but the
pattern is by no means clear. Many of
the populations with the highest growth
rates had generation times of intermediate length.

Based on observations in teasel (a
plant) populations in which a negative
correlation between W, and A, was
found, Caswell (1989) suggested that
more rapidly growing populations may
be associated with shorter generation
times. Since increases in population
growth rates among Herero are associated with longer periods of osci'lation,
Caswell’s suggestion cannot be true in
general. Instead, this study suggests that
the magnitude of the peak in reproductive rates may have the most dramatic
effect on the frequency W, in human
populations. The curves of the agespecific fertility rates for the earliest periods in Figure 1 are relatively flat. The
curve becomes sharply peaked following the period 1957-66, after which the
most substantial increase in W, occurs.
While increases in fertility have resulted

in dramatic increases in population
growth rates, these increases appear to
be more gradual.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The shape of the present-day Herero
population pyramid reflects the structure of its founding population, which
was composed of a high proportion of
adolescent girls. The aging of these girls
into their childbearing years is probably
responsible for an apparent wave in the
pyramid today. Evidence for infectious
infertility afflicting this population
through the mid-1950’s can be seen in
the narrow structure of the upper portion of the pyramid, while tts recently
broadened base is indicative of a gradual
shift to higher rates of fertility.

The leading eigenvalue \, of the Leslie matrix for the Herero population in
the first half of this century indicates that
population growth was —0.15 per cent
per year. The finding that the Herero
has been a declining population for most
of its history in Botswana suggests that
the number given refuge in Botswana
during the Herero-German War has
been significantly underestimated.
Since the Botswana census enumerated
5,798 Herero in 1946, the near-zero
population growth rate suggests that the
number of refugees may have been as |
many as 6,000. Using the growth rates in

Table 3 and the 1946 census figure as the
baseline population, we estimate that
the Herero population in Botswana
would have grown to about 12,000 in
1986. Although population movement
between Namibia and Botswana may affect these estimates, most of the migration of Herero is probably towards
Namibia, the Herero homeland (Pennington, 1990).

Finally, recovery from infertility is
responsible for transforming the Herero
from a declining population into one experiencing extremely high population
growth rates of about 3.5 per cent per
year, a finding of great importance to
policy planners in parts of Africa still
characterized by high levels of involuntary infertility. The decrease in infertility has resulted in an increase in the pe

riod of oscillation in the population from
about 22 to 29 years. Since the period of
oscillation is approximately equal to
generation time, which is correlated
with the mean age of childbearing in a
population, these findings indicate that
more children today are being born to
mothers who are older than those in previous decades.
