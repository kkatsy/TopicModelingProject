ABSTRACT: While there have been several conceptual analyses of pronatalist influences on fertility, a comparatively small amount of empirical work relates these forces to actual differentials in
reproductive behavior. The impact of pronatalist incentives on the fertility of military couples in
the United States is examined with data from the 1970 Public Use Samples. The findings failed to
support the idea that such incentives lead to higher fertility. Implications of the findings for
policies designed to lower fertility are discussed.

The effects of various pronatalist influences on human fertility have been recognized in the social science literature for at
least sixty years. Hollingworth (1916), in
an insightful early paper, identified a wide
spectrum of means by which societies encourage reproduction. In recent years,
concern over rapid population growth in
both the developed and developing nations has led to increased interest in the
topic. Most analyses begin with the assumption that pronatalist values and
institutions evolved in response to the high
and fluctuating mortality which has
characterized mankind throughout most
of history.

There are at least three levels at which
pronatalist influences can be seen to operate. First, there are official governmental
and organizational policies and procedures
which have the intentional or unintentional effect of encouraging reproduction.
Financial incentives and laws governing
the availability of abortion are examples of
policies which governments have used
deliberately to raise the birth rate (David
and Wright, 1971; McIntyre, 1975; Teitelbaum, 1972). Discriminatory tax legislation that adversely affects single persons

and married couples without children,
public housing allotments based on family
size, and liberal maternity benefits including paid maternity leaves are thought to
support reproduction even though this
may not have been the intent (Blake, 1972;
Davis, 1967). A second level of pronatalist
influence stems from the existence of various social norms, values, and _ beliefs
which stress the primacy of parental roles
for adults and elevate parenthood (Blake,
1972). Much of the literature on sex roles
and the feminist movement has concerned
the direct, as well as the subtle but powerful, forces that encourage women to marry
and bear children (Peck and Senderowitz,
1974). As Blake (1972) notes, even the
feminist movement is basically supportive
of motherhood, although critical of the
disadvantages that accrue to women
because of childbearing and rearing. Finally, pronatalist sex roles are often internalized into the personality structure of
individuals, particularly women (Blake,
1972, 1974; Clarkson et al., 1970). Thus,
women at an early age are subjected to
pressures to “select personality traits and
behavior patterns that are believed to be
congruent with the status of wife and

260

mother” (Blake, 1974, p. 145). These three
levels of influence correspond roughly to
the societal, group, and individual levels
of analysis that are regularly employed in
social demographic work (Ford and DeJong, 1970; Goldscheider, 1971; Nam and
Gustavus, 1976).

While there have been several conceptual analyses of pronatalist influences
(Blake, 1969, 1972, 1974; Davis, 1967;
Demeny, 1972; Dykstra, 1959; Lloyd, 1974;
Noonan and Dunlap, 1972), there is a
comparatively small amount of empirical
work that relates these forces to differentials in reproductive behavior. The effects
of official governmental policies designed
to raise the birth rate have been studied
empirically. Perhaps most notable is the
work of McIntyre on the effects of financial
incentives on fertility in Eastern Europe,
plus the analyses by David and Wright
(1971) and Teibelbaum (1972) of the effects of restrictive abortion legislation on
fertility in Romania. These analyses,
however, have dealt with explicit national
policies designed to influence reproductive
behavior. The impact on fertility of less
direct, and for the most part unintentional,
pronatalist incentives has not received
much attention. A notable exception on
antinatalist incentives is the work of
Hohm (1975) on the effect on fertility of
national social security programs.

This paper examines the impact of
pronatalist incentives on the fertility of
military couples in the United States. The
American military does not have a conscious policy aimed at encouraging reproduction. Nonetheless, certain official procedures and administrative practices of
the military may be pronatalist in effect, if
not in intent. Moreover, a recent discussion of pronatalism argued that there is
considerable informal but nonetheless
strong pressure for childbearing in the
military (Peck and Senderowitz, 1974).
The research question is: If there are

Stokes and Sell

Social Biology

pronatalist incentives in the military beyond those existing in the larger society,
are these reflected in higher fertility among
military than among civilian couples?

PRONATALIST INCENTIVES IN
THE MILITARY

Incentives to reproduction among military couples may be divided into economic and noneconomic incentives. Noneconomic incentives include the subtle
and not so subtle pressures that family,
friends, and associates may bring to bear
on childless couples and couples with only
one child. Griffith (1973) has demonstrated that a large majority of American
couples expect social pressure to be
exerted under such _ circumstances.
Whether or not such informal pressures
are greater among military couples is not
addressed in this study. Such pressures are
worthy of examination and would have
been a valuable addition to the study, but
were beyond the scope of this effort.

Economic benefits associated with employment in the military have long been an
attractive feature of military life. The provision of medical care, housing, shopping
facilities, and other support services, in
addition to attractive retirement benefits,
are strong inducements for career military
personnel. In some cases, these benefits
accrue in direct proportion to family size.

The area of housing has been singled
out as perhaps the most visible form of
pronatalist pressure in the military (Peck
and Senderowitz, 1974, p. 132). Residence
on military bases is dependent upon military exigencies, personnel requirements,
and availability. In 1966, approximately
one-third of all eligible military personnel
could be accommodated in on-post family
housing units (Little, 1971, p. 258). Once
military eligibility criteria have been met,
bedroom requirements for on-post housing
are determined solely on the basis of fam

Vol. 25, No. 4

ily size and composition. Thus, two officers of similar rank and seniority would be
eligible for quite unequal housing quarters, based upon marital status and number of dependents. Where such facilities
exist on-post, one individual may qualify
for nothing more than a one-bedroom
apartment, while another receives a fourbedroom dwelling. The cost of housing a
family with several children under such
circumstances is no more than it would be
if the couple were childless.

This benefit is reduced, however, when
on-post housing is unavailable. In this
situation, the military provides a housing
allowance based on rank. This allowance
is paid at a “with dependent” or “without
dependent” rate, regardless of family size.
This policy reduces the benefit somewhat
to families with several children who need
larger quarters, but still results in a relative advantage to married individuals.
This is particularly true of the noncommissioned or petty officer. As Little (1971,
p. 252) points out: “There are rarely
facilities comparable to the Bachelor
Officers’ Quarters (BOQ), and only married personnel are permitted to live offbase and to draw the monetary allowance
in lieu of government quarters.” While the
provision of housing facilities and/or housing allowances have not been related empirically to higher fertility, housing shortages and tight housing markets have been
demonstrated to have a fertility-inhibiting
effect (Felson and Solaun, 1975).

A major economic benefit to military
couples came with the passage of the Dependent’s Medical Care Act of 1956.
Under the provisions of this bill, the families of military personnel were assured of
medical care as a right. Before that time,
medical care for dependents had been a
privilege extended where facilities were
available (Shea, 1966, p. 252). The provision of free medical care removes many of
the direct costs associated with pregnancy

Pronatalism and Fertility

261

and childbirth. Hospitalization and delivery, as well as infant and child care are
provided without cost. Thus, one financial
barrier to childbearing is effectively
removed. Further, recent years have seen
greater attempts by the military to provide
a wide array of services for enlisted families. Among those offered are: “legal and
real estate advice; family counseling;
baby-sitting services; employment opportunities for wives; loans of infant furnishings, linen, and china; and the like” (Moskos, 1970, p. 175). When the family is
allowed to accompany the serviceman or
servicewoman to a foreign station, free
dental care for dependents is also provided
(Little, 1971, p. 261).

Another benefit which reduces the cost
of rearing children is shopping privileges
at commissaries and post exchanges. Moskos (1970, p. 69) cites a 1967 Defense
Department study which estimated that a
married sergeant with three children could
save up to $500 a year by shopping at
these facilities. Similarly, the cost of moving a family is at least partially underwritten. The travel allowance given to personnel when they are transferred varies
directly with family size.

None of these incentives were necessarily established with the intent of encouraging reproduction, although one Army captain, writing anonymously, has charged
that Army policies are “actively
pronatalist as well as discriminatory
against those who do not have children”
(Peck and Senderowitz, 1974, p. 133).
Regardless of intent, subsidized housing,
free medical care for dependents, lower
cost of food, and other benefits may be
pronatalist in their effect. It should be
noted that many civilian occupations also
include some of the benefits enjoyed by
military personnel. The extent to which
military benefits exceed those of civilians
could not be estimated directly. However,
if maternity benefits are an indicator of the

262 Stokes and Sell

differential, the disparity is substantial.
One recent survey of 67 insurance companies covering 47 million Americans in
group coverage, reported that only onethird of insured individuals were covered
by maternity benefits. Moreover, only 20
per cent of these had full prenatal coverage; two-thirds had maximum maternity
benefits of $300 or more, while only 11 per
cent had a benefit of $750 or more
(Planned Parenthood Federation of America, 1975). These benefits are in comparison to an estimated cost of a normal delivery in a voluntary, nonprofit hospital of
about $1,100 in 1972.

While these data refer only to costs surrounding the birth of a child, and not to
dependent care coverage after delivery, it
appears that military benefits for medical
care, and particularly maternity coverage,
are substantially greater than those enjoyed by most civilians. Since most civilian jobs make no provision for housing
allowances, the disparity between military
and civilian families in this area would be
éven greater. Thus, while no precise measure of the economic incentives were
available, military couples clearly receive
a number of benefits which reduce the direct cost of bearing and rearing children.

The incentives to reproduction in the
military should operate in addition to
those identified in the larger society. Thus,
to the extent that the military serves as an
exemplar of traditional values of the society (Janowitz, 1960), an added set of incentives can be expected to result in higher
fertility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data consist of two samples of married couples with spouse present extracted
from the 1970 5 per cent neighborhood
characteristics Public Use Sample (PUS)
(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1972). The
samples were restricted to couples in

Social Biology

which the wife was 44 years of age or
younger and either white or Black. The
first sample (VN = 7,437) was extracted
from the 1/100 PUS and consists of couples
in which the husband’s employment status
indicated that he was in the armed forces
in 1970. The second sample (N = 23,713)
was drawn from the 1/1,000 PUS and is
composed of couples in which the husband
was not in the military. The use of two
different samples was necessary because
the 1/1,000 PUS had too few military
couples for the desired analysis, while the
1/100 PUS had too many civilian couples
to process efficiently.

Throughout the analysis we assumed
that both the civilian and military samples
could be treated as simple random samples
of the populations they represent. Technically, this is not the case because census
sample questions are cluster samples at the

‘ household level. Design factors have been

calculated for the Public Use Samples
(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1972, p. 189),
and for the characteristics used in this
analysis. All have design factors of 1.0 or
less, except race, which has a design factor
of 1.1. A design factor less than unity indicates that the sampling error obtained
under a simple random sample assumption for a given characteristic will be
somewhat inflated. Although the same
statement cannot be extended to combinations of characteristics or regression
analyses (Frankel, 1971; U.S. Bureau of
the Census, 1972, p. 201), given that most of
the design factors for the characteristics
used were unity or less, we felt that the
assumption of a simple random sample
was appropriate for our purposes.

One restriction on the sample of military
couples should be noted. The population
from which the sample was drawn was
one of couples residing in the United
States at the time of the 1970 census.
Couples living abroad and couples not living together at the time of the census were

not included. We are not able to estimate
how representative military couples living
in the United States are of all military
couples, but we are aware of no systematic
bias. In addition, if biases with respect to
factors such as age and race do exist, they
are controlled in the analysis.

It was necessary to control a number of
variables in the analysis that are known to
influence fertility. These include age of
wife, age at first marriage, wife’s education, race, number of times married, and
family income. Measurement of these
variables in the PUS is straightforward
with minor exceptions. Education was
measured as the highest grade of school
completed rather than the highest grade
attended. The variable “times married” is
a dichotomy indicating once married or
married more than once. Descriptive
statistics on this variable therefore represent the percentage of husbands or wives
married more than once. The race of husband was classified into white and nonwhite while race of wife was restricted to
white or Black. Age of wife, age at first
marriage, and family income were used as
continuous variables as coded in the PUS.

The decision to use husband’s occupation in 1970 to identify military couples
was based on several considerations. Initially, some indicator of “career” military
occupation was deemed desirable. This
was based on the assumption that the
cumulative impact of special incentives to
childbearing in the military would be most
pronounced among couples for whom the
military was a career. However, an argument can be made that these incentives
would operate on noncareer couples as
well, particularly in influencing the timing
of childbearing. Noncareer couples could
transfer the direct costs of pregnancy and
childbirth to the military by having desired births earlier than comparable civilian couples. If this were the case, then
younger military couples (including the

Pronatalism and Fertility

263

noncareer couples) should have higher fertility than civilian couples of comparable
age and marital duration.

The 1970 census did not contain a question regarding career plans. Consequently,
no direct measure of career military personnel was possible. A question was asked
regarding occupation in 1965. By identifying persons in the armed forces in both
1965 and 1970, it was possible to indirectly
measure those for whom the military was
likely to be a career, or at a minimum,
those who were serving two terms. In addition, among older couples, it is increasingly likely that those men whose 1970
occupation was in the armed forces were
pursuing military careers, because few
men over 30 would be in the armed forces
for a single term. Preliminary analyses of
the data revealed no significant differences
in results using occupation in 1970, or restricting the sample to men who were in the
armed forces in both 1965 and 1970. Thus,
occupation in 1970 was used because this
increased the size of the military sample,
particularly among the younger age categories and permitted a more detailed analysis for young couples.

RESULTS

Characteristics of both husbands and
wives in the civilian and military samples
are presented in Table 1. With the large
number of cases included in the samples, it
is not surprising that most of the differences between civilian and _ military
couples were statistically significant. Civilian couples on the average were older and
had higher incomes in 1969 than military
couples. On the other hand, both the husband and wife were better educated in
military families, and males in the military
were less likely to have been married more
than once. Because differences in age
composition were not controlled, the
higher aggregate fertility of civilian

age at first marriage or in the percentage of
women married more than once.

FERTILITY OF MILITARY AND CIVILIAN
COUPLES

The mean number of children ever born
to military and civilian couples by age, age
at first marriage, and education is given in
Table 2. The data refer to white women
only. This restriction was necessitated by
the detailed cross-tabulation and by the
comparatively small number of Black
women in the military sample. Race of
wife was retained in the regression analysis so that the effect of this variable could
be estimated. The mean number of children ever born varied in the expected
direction with wife’s age, age at first marriage, and wife’s education. Within both
civilian and military samples, fertility
varied directly with age of wife and inversely with age at first marriage and education.

One estimate of the effect of pronatalist
incentives on the fertility of military
couples is obtained by comparing the

number of children ever born to civilian
and military couples within age, age at
marriage, and education categories. For
example, civilian women aged 20-24,
with less than 12 years of schooling, who
married at age 18 or younger, had an
average of 2.0 children, compared to an
average of 1.7 for military women with
similar characteristics. Since pronatalist
incentives could affect the timing of
childbearing or the size of completed families, or both, the fertility comparisons are
separated into two major age categories
representing wives aged 15-29 years and
those 30 years and older. Younger age
groups are used to estimate timing effects
and the older age groups to estimate effects on completed family size.

If the effect of pronatalist incentives operates primarily or exclusively through altering the timing or spacing of births, then
the fertility of younger couples in the
armed forces should be higher than that of
civilian couples with similar characteristics. This follows from the argument that
young military couples would not be
forced to delay childbearing, which should
be reflected in a greater number of children ever born. Timing may be particu

larly important for couples in which a military career is not anticipated. In this case,
an intended pregnancy may occur sooner
than originally planned in order for the
couple to qualify for military medical
benefits. On the other hand, if the only
effect is on the timing of births, and not
the total number of children intended or
desired, no significant difference should
obtain for older couples. The three
youngest age groups (15-19, 20-24, 25-29)
are undoubtedly those for whom a timing
effect would be most pronounced.

One caution should be noted in interpreting differences between younger civilian and military couples. The timing of
military service in relation to fertility
could not be ascertained from the data.
Thus, some military couples may have
had children before entering the military.
Conversely, some civilian husbands may
have previous military experience. While
cases such as these undoubtedly occur in
the data, they should not represent a very
large percentage of the sample and would
decrease with age of husband and wife.

An inspection of these age groups in
Table 2 failed to reveal higher fertility
among military couples. Military and civilian couples in which the wife was 15-29
years of age exhibit minor differences in
the mean number of children ever born.
There are 31 comparisons of military and
civilian couples that may be made for this
age group. Military wives had slightly
higher fertility in 6 instances; civilian
women were higher in 20 of the 31 comparisons. However, the two groups were
either equal or within 0.2 of each other for
24 of the 31 comparisons, and the largest
mean difference in children ever born was
only 0.4. The findings for younger couples
clearly do not suggest a timing effect on
fertility resulting from pronatalist incentives in the military.

To illustrate the impact of sampling var

iation on these comparisons, a detailed
consideration of women who are
categorized close to the average values obtained in Table 1 can be considered. For
example, for women aged 25-29 with 12
years of schooling who first married between the ages of 21-22 years (the
stereotypical marriage age of 19-20 could
not be used because the means of children
ever born were equal), mean fertility for
civilian couples was 1.684 (N = 434) and
for military couples 1.536 (V = 140). The
differences between these values if they
were first rounded is 1.7~1.5, or 0.2 children. Standard deviations for civilian and
military couples were 1.153 and 1.042
with corresponding standard errors of
0.055 and 0.088. We would like to know
how likely it is that a difference of means
of zero would likely be the result of sampling variation. The standard error of the
difference in this example is 0.104 suggesting that the true difference between the
means has a 95 per cent chance of being in
the interval from -—0.055 to 0.353
(Blalock, 1972 p. 232). Looking at this
single comparison, we find that the mean
fertility of these two groups could easily be
the same, and given the number of comparisons, it would be hard to reject the
general hypothesis that the fertility of
civilian and military couples is similar.
Although no effect was found for
younger couples, this does not eliminate
the possibility that the cumulative fertility
of older couples may be influenced. The
overwhelming preference that Americans
express for a family with at least two children, coupled with the disfavor in which
childless and one child families are held
(Griffith, 1973), suggest that pronatalist
incentives may not operate until the minimum socially acceptable family size is
achieved. If this is the situation, then incentives would not result in higher fertility
until after two children were born. Thus,

no effect would be seen among young
couples, but some effect might be demonstrable for the fertility of older women.

For women 30 years old and over, 44
comparisons are afforded of the fertility of
civilian and military couples (Table 2).
The findings are quite similar to those in
the younger age groups. Civilian and military couples have had a remarkably similar number of children. Of the 44 possible
comparisons within the age, age at marriage, and educational categories, military
couples exhibited higher fertility in 16
instances, civilian couples were higher in
20 cases, and the two groups were identical in 8 comparisons. Moreover, there was
no pattern to the observed differences
which did occur. The tabular results for
older couples thus also fail to support the
idea of higher fertility among military families.

simultaneously a larger number of variables which might influence the fertility of
civilian and military couples. Regressions

and Fertility 267
The regression analysis supported the earlier findings that military status had no
effect on fertility. A dummy variable for
military/civilian occupation (coded military = 1, civilian = 0) was included with
six other variables in a multiple regression
analysis for the total combined samples.
Military status was the only variable
which was not statistically significant and
the sign was in the opposite direction. It
should be noted that the weighting procedure required for the combination of the
two samples reduced the chance that the
occupational variable would be significant
due to the relatively small number of military couples. However, even when the
regression was run on the unweighted
sample—a procedure which causes military families to be over-represented by a
factor of ten—the opposite sign prevails
(results not shown). (For a discussion and
example of the effects of weighting upon
regression results based on disproportionate stratified sampling, see Erlanger,
1977, p. 236).

The separate regressions for the military
and civilian samples provide the opportunity to examine the effects of other vari

ables. The unstandardized regression
coefficients indicate that the six independent variables affect fertility in the two
groups in much the same manner. The
betas further reveal an identical ordering
of the importance of the variables. Age of
wife was the single most important variable followed by her age at first marriage
and her education. Race of wife was also
an important predictor of children ever
born. Black women had borne more children than white women, and this effect
appeared somewhat stronger among civilian than military women. Women married more than once had lower fertility
than those in a single union. Finally, family income had a small positive effect on
children ever born, but it was the weakest
predictor of the variables included, and its
substantive significance is questionable in
view of the large sample size.

The regression results then indicate that
the fertility of military and civilian couples
is influenced in much the same way by a
set of social and demographic variables.
The findings appear straightforward.
Regardless of how the data are analyzed,
there is no evidence to support the effect
on fertility of pronatalist incentives in the
military.

DISCUSSION

A review of military policies and procedures indicated that a number of
pronatalist incentives exist for military
couples. Benefits such as housing quarters
and housing allowances, free medical care
for dependents, including the costs of hospitalization and delivery connected with
childbirth, and reduced costs of clothing
and feeding children were seen as reducing
the economic costs of children to military
families. Economists, sociologists, and

Stokes and Sell

Social Biology

demographers have argued that such conditions operate to encourage reproduction
(Blake, 1969; Davis, 1967; Lloyd, 1974).
However, little empirical work has
directly examined the effects of such policies on actual fertility.

The data of this study failed to support
the idea that such incentives lead to higher
fertility. No effect was found either for
young couples, for whom we thought a
timing and/or spacing effect might possibly operate, or for older couples whose
cumulative fertility was hypothesized to
differ. The findings were distinguished
primarily by the remarkable similarity in
the reproductive behavior of couples who
received the incentives and those who did
not.

The failure to find higher fertility
among military couples may be due to several considerations. First, the incentives
discussed simply may not be pronatalist.
The lower economic costs of childbearing
and childrearing to military families,
however, argues against this interpretation. Blake (1972) and Davis (1967),
among others, have argued that such factors encourage reproduction.

Secondly, pronatalist incentives, particularly economic incentives, may have
no substantial effect on fertility, or at least
no strong effect in comparison to other
social and psychological factors. These
data support such an interpretation and
are in agreement with a growing body of
research which finds a negligible effect of
economic incentives on fertility (Cain,
1973; Cutwright, 1970; Placek and
Hendershot, 1974; Presser and Salsberg,
1975).

Third, the negative findings may result
from uncontrolled factors operating to
suppress real differences which may exist.
Several such factors can be identified.
Most important for this investigation are
the frequent disruptions of family life

created by residential instability and periodic separation of spouses. Frequent
and/or prolonged periods of marital separation obviously could exert a negative
effect on fertility. However, it is unlikely
that such separations constitute a large
enough portion of married life to significantly lower fertility. Moreover, Miller
(1973) has argued that geographic mobility
and separation are conditions which increase the likelihood of an unwanted conception. Such conditions do not promote
the continuity of communication and
planning necessary for effective contraception, particularly for couples using traditional chemical or mechanical means of
contraception (Stokes and Dudley, 1972).
In addition, the periodic absence of the
male paradoxically may operate to increase fertility by increasing the psychological importance of the mother role with
its attendant pressure for higher fertility
(Rainwater, 1965; Stokes, 1973). Because
some of the effects of separation may be
offsetting, we do not feel that periodic
separations of military couples account for
the failure to find higher fertility in the
military.

Finally, it might be argued that military
couples have greater access to contraceptive services than civilian couples and thus
have less unwanted childbearing. The inconsistent position of the military toward
abortion services argues against this interpretation. Moreover, even if this were
the case, it would account for only a small
portion of the observed differences. The
consistency of both the tabular and regression results in showing essentially the
same parameters of fertility behavior for
military and civilian couples suggests that
both groups are responsive to similar
influences.

While economic factors may have an
important effect on fertility, the social context in which reproductive decisions are

Pronatalism and Fertility

269

made is equally important. The social and
psychological costs of children to parents
would appear to be as important as economic costs in setting a ceiling on “tastes”
for children. On the other hand, the strong
normative pressure for a family with at
least two children (Blake, 1967; Freedman
et al., 1965; Griffith, 1973) suggests that
economic factors may not enter the decision until this point in the reproductive
career. It is precisely at this juncture that
Easterlin (1973, p. 207) proposes the relative status factor of early adulthood would
operate when he argues that “variations
from one cohort to another in relative
status circumstances will tend through
their effect on early childbearing experience to produce shifts, chiefly within the
two- to four-child range, in ideals and expectations about completed family size.”

The combination of social and economic
forces in this theory of fertility would appear, on both theoretical and empirical
grounds, to have a greater effect on reproductive behavior than the incentives
examined in this study. The decisions to
have children and the number to have appear to carry such profound implications
for the social, psychological, and economic
well-being of couples that such decisions
simply may not be sensitive to temporary
or short-run incentives.

These findings indicate that further research on the impact of tax laws, familysize criteria in public housing, maternity
leaves and benefits, and the like is called
for. While alterations in these policies may
be desirable, changing them because they
are viewed as pronatalist attributes an importance to them well beyond their demonstrated effect. The effect of such policies
and changes therein on fertility merit careful empirical examination. Until such
studies are forthcoming, population planners and policy-makers would do well to
exercise caution in recommending legisla

upon their assumed pronatalist effect.
