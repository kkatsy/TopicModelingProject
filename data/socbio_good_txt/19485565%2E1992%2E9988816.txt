ABSTRACT: Nonuse of contraception at first intercourse among adolescents is well documented
in the adolescent sexuality research literature. This study provides a formal test of the hypothesis
that an increase in the courtship period (i.e., waiting time to intercourse) increases the likelihood
that a couple will discuss contraception and use it at first intercourse. The data analyzed are from
personal interviews with 1,314 women aged 20-29 in the 1983 National Survey of Unmarried
Women. The results are mixed about the effect of waiting time on contraceptive behavior,
providing weak support for the hypothesis, but also elucidating individual and relative characteristics of the couples, such as age and education of the respective partners, that affected
contraceptive behavior at first intercourse. Support for the hypothesis may prove more robust in
data with different characteristics from the survey used here.

Adolescent sexuality research has
shown that the transition from virginity
to nonvirginity typically follows a predictable course. Often, sexual initiation occurs after a period of courtship
characterized by various rites of passage. Sexual activities during this period become progressively more intimate as adolescents experiment with
kissing, hugging, necking, petting, and
heavy petting, and often ultimately intercourse. The speed with which couples move from “early” noncoital sexual activities to sexual intercourse may
have important implications for pregnancy and disease prevention among
adolescents.

Waiting time to coitus is defined as
the period between the beginning of a
relationship and the timing of first intercourse. The length of this period is

_ expected to affect pregnancy and dis
ease risk-taking behavior because of
its impact on the couple’s opportunity
and ability to communicate and to prepare themselves for sexual intercourse

(Cvetkovich and Grote, 1981; Jorgensen et al., 1980; Thompson and Spanier, 1978). Research literature on adolescent sexuality, contraception, and
pregnancy is replete with empirical evidence on nonuse of contraception at
the initial stages of this transition from
virginity to nonvirginity (Cvetkovich
and Grote, 1983; Kantner and Zelnik,
1973; Zabin, et al., 1979; Zelnik and
Kantner, 1977, 1978; Zelnik and Shah,
1983; Zelnik et al., 1981).

Commonly offered reasons for nonuse of contraception during this transition period center around the unexpectedness of the act of intercourse,
the episodic and unplanned nature of
their sexual activity, unpreparedness,
lack of communication regarding contraception between partners, and failure to assume responsibility by the
partners to prevent a pregnancy (Bauman, 1970; DeLamater and MacCorquodale, 1979; Maxwell et al. 1977;
Morrison, 1985; Shah et al., 1975; Zelnik and Kantner, 1979; Zelnik et al.,

1981). These interrelated reasons stem
from inadequate interaction between
partners because of the short time
spent in courtship prior to engaging in
sexual intercourse. Intercourse is more
predictable in an established relationship, and familiarity with a partner increases communication about contraception, the motivation to use, and the
actual use of contraception (Kisker,
1985).

In this paper we explore the determinants of waiting time to coitus in a
steady relationship and the effects of
waiting time on contraceptive behavior. First, we examine the factors that
determine the length of the waiting
time within a general socio-demographic framework, and distinguish
high-risk and low-risk groups based on
waiting-time duration. Subsequently,
we examine the effects of the waiting
time on contraceptive communication
and behavior.

We expect several patterns to
emerge from this analysis. First, net of
the impact of other socio-demographic
controls, the longer the waiting time,
the more likely a couple is to discuss
pregnancy prevention. Similarly, the
longer the waiting time is, the higher
are the chances that a couple will negotiate a contraceptive method suitable to the context of their relationship. As a result, waiting time ts
expected to be positively associated
with contraceptive use and choice of an
effective method.

Waiting time has salient implications for the prevention of sexually
transmitted diseases (STDs) as well.
The longer the waiting time, the more
a couple will get to know each other,
probably discussing their respective
sexual histories, as well as ways to pro

tect themselves from STDs, including
AIDS. Therefore, we use the duration
of the waiting time to identify those individuals who are at higher or lower
risk of acquiring STD and _ subsequently test whether or not waiting
time is associated with a preventive behavior, condom use. We were not able
to test the effects of waiting time on
other STD preventive behaviors due to
data restrictions.

The analysis is carried out in two
stages. First, we estimate multivariate
equations to examine the determinants
of the waiting time to first intercourse
within the first /ong-term relationship.
Subsequently, we estimate the net effect of waiting time on contraceptive
behavior controlling for the effects of
the socio-demographic factors introduced in the first stage. More specifically, we examine the impact of waiting
time on the likelihood that the couple
discussed contraception, whether or
not they used a method of contraception, and method choice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data used in this paper were obtained in 1983 through personal interviews from a nationally representative
sample of women aged 20-29 who had
never been married. The survey, the
National Survey of Unmarried Women
(NSUW), was based on a stratified and
clustered probability sample of households and a representative sample of
women residents in college dormitories
and sorority houses in the coterminous
United States. The total sample comprised 1,314 women; 1,149 from the
household sample, and 165 from the
college dormitory sample, with response rates of 78 per cent and 82 per

cent respectively. To insure adequate
representation, black women were
oversampled in the household sample,
but not in the college sample. Poststratification weights were added to adjust for stratification, clustering, and
disproportionate sampling of areas and
oversampling of blacks. Therefore, the
results can be generalized to the U.S.
population represented by the sample.
Unless otherwise noted, all results presented in this paper are based on
weighted data.

The data contain retrospective information on all heterosexual relationships which lasted three months or
longer and in which sexual intercourse
occurred at least once. These are referred to as long-term or steady relationships. The relationship histories include the beginning month and year of
each relationship and the month and
year in which intercourse within the relationship first occurred. From these, it
is possible to calculate a waiting time
to coitus measure as the number of
months between the starting date of
the relationship and the date of the first
sexual intercourse within the relationship. A month is the smallest time unit
with which we can measure waiting
time. As is customary in demography,
we assume that events occur at the
midpoint of the month; events occurring in two consecutive months are assumed to be one month apart. We set
the waiting time to zero for those couples for whom the beginning of the relationship and first intercourse were in
the same month.

As noted above, a steady relationship is defined as one lasting three
months or longer, and in which coitus
has occurred. The duration restriction
was imposed primarily to improve re
Waiting Time to Coitus

call ability by focusing on /ong-term or
steady relationships only, but this has
two potential effects: First, women
who were sexually active, but who
never had a long-term relationship, are
excluded from the analysis, because
relationship-specific information is not
available for these women. Yet, these
women, by definition, have not waited
long before they had intercourse with
their partners. Consequently, the waiting time estimates are subject to an upward bias. In our sample, only 23 sexually active women had not had a
three-month or longer relationship.
Therefore, the bias resulting from the
exclusion of these women is likely to be
small. Secondly, 18 per cent of the
women in the sample had never had
sexual intercourse; but, one-third of
these virgin women were in a steady relationship. Eventually, some of these
women will have sexual intercourse
with their partner, some time after the
survey. These women would have contributed a longer waiting time had they
not been excluded from the analysis.
The average duration of such relationships is about 20 months, compared to
7.3 months of average waiting time by
all women in the first relationship.
Consequently, the waiting time estimates are subject to a downward bias
because of this censoring effect.
Thirdly, because the smallest unit in
which waiting time can be measured is
a month, some amount of variation in
waiting time is lost and consequently
the resulting estimates of waiting time
may be slightly biased. It is difficult to
predict the direction of this bias because the procedure used to measure
waiting time may cause some of the
effects to cancel each other. But, since
the analysis is confined to waiting time

 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:44 08 December 2015

186

in the first relationship, the loss of variation is less likely to be problematic.
As we will show later, average waiting
time diminishes rapidly by relationship
order. If we were to examine subsequent relationships, the lack of a more
precise measurement of waiting time
would cause a more serious problem.
On the other hand, an attempt to retrospectively measure waiting time in
units smaller than a month would have
introduced a pronounced recall bias for
early relationships.

Finally, the sample consists only of
never-married women. This restriction
precludes comparison with the premarital behavior of ever-married women
and introduces a marriage selection
bias. This bias is more salient for retrospective behaviors that are closely
associated with the decision to marry,
such as premarital pregnancy. For example, the never-married women in
our sample may be older at first intercourse and less likely to have had a premarital pregnancy than a comparable
sample of ever-married women. Despite these limitations, the NSUW data
set is unique in that it contains detailed
information necessary to construct
measures of waiting time to coitus
within a relationship, as well as the
matched characteristics of the respondent and her partner at the beginning
of the relationship.

For several conceptual and practical
reasons, the analysis is confined to
white women who were virgins at the
beginning of their first long-term
relationship. We focus on the first relationship, because it represents the
transition to adulthood better than
subsequent relationships. In this sample, more than 80 per cent of the
women enter the first such relationship
without prior sexual intercourse expe

rience, that is, as virgins. Furthermore,
the subsequent effect of waiting time
on contraceptive behavior is more salient in the first relationship when a
woman is less experienced than in later
relationships. Evidence has shown that
contraceptive behavior at first intercourse establishes a pattern for later
behavior (Rindfuss et al., 1986). Finally, from an empirical standpoint,
there is more variation in waiting time
in the first relationship than in the ensuing relationships. Average waiting
time diminishes sharply with relationship order, and without a more precise
unit of measurement we find very little
variation in waiting time controlling for
relationship order.

We chose to focus on women who
were virgins when they began their
first long-term relationship because
the timing of contraceptive use and
method choice can be determined with
more specificity for these women than
for all women in their first relationship
regardless of prior sexual experience.
For virgins, specific information on
method use and choice at first intercourse can be used to construct precise
measures of contraceptive behavior.
For women who entered their first
steady relationship with prior intercourse experience, both the method
use and the specific method used lack a
clear time reference within the relationship and are therefore more ambiguous. Furthermore, in multivariate
models estimated for all women, prior
sexual experience appears to explain
much of the variance in waiting time,
as prior intercourse experience significantly (p <0.001) reduces the length
of the waiting time.

The sample was limited to white
women due to the well documented
racial differences in sexual behavior

among adolescents and post-teen single women (Furstenberg, 1987; Furstenberg et al., 1987; Moore et al.,
1986). In early analyses, we found that
race was strongly associated with the
length of waiting time (p<0.001).
However, when blacks and whites
were analyzed separately, the models
for black women did not adequately fit
the data. Evidently, the specified variables do not accurately capture the experience of black women with respect
to waiting time and the subsequent effect of waiting time on contraceptive
behavior. Hence, we narrowed our
analysis to white women only.

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
AND VARIABLES

The conceptual framework which
consists of an individual-level sociodemographic model is presented in
Figure 1. According to this framework,
waiting time to coitus is viewed as a
function of the woman’s, her partner’s,
and the couple’s relative characteristics
at the beginning of the relationship.
This model is based on the view that
the transition from virginity to nonvirginity is the culmination of a process

that may have begun in very early
adolescence, around pubescence. Consequently, individual background and
current characteristics influence the
timing of this transition (Bauman and
Udry, 1981; Billy and Udry, 1983;
Hofferth, 1987; National Research
Council, 1987; Udry, 1979; Udry and
Billy, 1987; Zelnik et al., 1981). Furthermore, behavior within a relationship is likely to be a product of both
partners’ traits, and therefore it is as
much influenced by the male partner as
by the female partner. The relative
characteristics of the partners may reflect the balance of power in the relationship and the bargaining position of
each partner. Thus we expect a woman’s and her partner’s relative characteristics to have significant effects on
waiting time.

The specific indicators used in this
analysis reflect the background characteristics of the woman, the prior experience of the partner, and the relative
ages, educational attainment, and religious affiliation of both partners at the
beginning of the relationship. Age is
used primarily as a control variable.
Past research has shown that more adolescents are becoming sexually active

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:44 08 December 2015

188

at earlier ages (National Research
Council, 1987; Pratt et al., 1984).
Hence, we expect waiting time to vary
inversely across the age range of the
women in our sample. The relative age
of the partners is measured as the difference in years of age at the beginning
of the relationship. These differences
are then collapsed into three categories
reflecting an older female partner, an
older male partner, and same age partners (plus or minus one year). We expect that the older partner is likely to
hold more power within the relationship, to play the dominant role, and to
have persuasive advantage in sexual
bargaining. Where the woman is the
older partner, we expect that she will
be able to delay the consummation of
the relationship. Conversely, an older,
more experienced, male partner is expected to shorten the waiting time to
coitus. Overall, we anticipate that
waiting time will be inversely related to
the woman’s age and curvilinearly related to relative age.

Woman’s education represents a
number of dimensions. Educational attainment may indicate career aspirations and ambitions that may inhibit
early initiation of sexual activity. Adolescent girls who place little value on
educational attainment are likely to
have intercourse at an early age (Devaney and Hubley, 1981; Furstenberg,
1976; Hogan and Kitagawa, 1985;
Mott, 1983; Moore et al., 1985). Yet,
relatively well-educated women may
be better informed about reproduction
and birth control and be prepared for
sexual activity, thus reducing waiting
time. We expect women’s education
will be inversely associated with waiting time. Similar to the measurement
of relative age, relative education is the

difference in the partners’ years of
schooling, collapsed into three categories. Partner’s education in relation to
the woman’s education is expected to
have a depressing effect on waiting
time, because the bargaining positions
of the partners is likely to be determined by their relative status.
Numerous studies have shown that
religion and religiosity have a strong
influence on the timing of the initiation
of sexual activity (Devaney and Hubley, 1981; Inazu and Fox, 1980; Jessor
and Jessor, 1975; Tanfer and Horn,
1985; Zelnik et al., 1981). Differences
in norms, values, and beliefs exist
across major religions regarding premarital sexual behavior. Protestant
fundamentalism, for example, has
been frequently associated with strong
conservative positions on issues of sexual behavior. Catholicism, on the other
hand, which was once regarded as a
good index of conservatism on moral
issues, has more recently found to be a
less reliable predictor of sexual behavior (Devaney and Hubley, 1981; Hofferth, 1987; Thornton and Camburn,
1983). The effect of such normative
constraints, or the lack of them, is expected to be reflected by the differences in waiting time among various
religious affiliations, such that, conservative Protestant women will have the
longest waiting time intervals, followed by Catholics, other Protestants,
and lastly by women with other or no
religious affiliation having the shortest
waiting periods. The religious homogamy variable is included to measure
the independent effects of reinforcing
versus conflicting normative pressures.
The effect of religion on waiting time
may be attenuated in relationships
where the couples hold dissimilar reliDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:44 08 December 2015

gious beliefs, while couples with similar beliefs are likely to reinforce each
other. Partner’s marital status is used
as a proxy for his previous sexual experience, which also may determine
the extent of his power within the relationship.

Mother’s education is included as a
proxy measure for socioeconomic background and parental aspirations. Other
research shows that parents with more
education are generally more affluent
than parents with less education, and
that children who come from families
with more educated parents tend to be
more goal and achievement oriented
(Conger, 1973; Davies and Kandel,
1981; Spenner and Featherman, 1978).
These characteristics may decrease the
likelihood of engaging in premarital
intercourse during adolescence (Chilman, 1980). Hence, we expect mother’s education to be positively associated with waiting time. Likewise, we
use family structure when the woman
was growing up (both parents vs one or
no parent) to approximate family socioeconomic status, as well as the level
and quality of parental support and
control during the transition years.
Single-parent families, especially those
headed by single females, are generally
less well-off than two-parent families,
and they provide less parental supervision than that in intact families. Consequently, women who grew up in a
nonintact family are more likely to
have intercourse at a younger age, and
we expect waiting time for these
women to be shorter than it is for
women who grew up with both parents
(Zelnik et al., 1981; Newcomer and
Udry, 1983; Moore et al., 1985).

The right-hand side of the conceptual framework represents the effects

Waiting Time to Coitus

189

of waiting time on contraceptive behavior. Waiting time is expected to influence contraceptive use and method
choice both directly and indirectly
through contraceptive communication
between the partners. The latter is posited as a direct function of the waiting
time within a relationship.

It has been shown in other research
that with increasing commitment to the
relationship couples are less embarrassed about sexual issues and more
likely to communicate openly about
these issues. In turn, increased communication within the sexual dyad regarding pregnancy prevention is very
reliably associated with more efficacious contraception (Cvetkovich and
Grote, 1981; DeLamater and MacCorquadale, 1978; Oskamp and Mindick,
1983; Thompson and Spanier, 1978).
Our hypotheses regarding the relationship between waiting time and contraceptive behavior are that the longer
the waiting time, the more likely is a
couple to discuss contraception; to use
contraception; and to choose an effective method. Two measures of contraceptive behavior are the use or nonuse
of any method at first intercourse, and
the specific method used at first intercourse. The latter measure is operationalized in four categories: pill/IUD,
condom, all other methods, and no
method. The pill and the IUD are
combined in a distinct category because each requires medical intervention and, with the exception of
sterilization, are the most effective
methods. The condom is placed in a
category by itself, because it is a male
method, it requires partner cooperation, and it ts an effective protection
against STDs. All other methods were
combined together because of their
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:44 08 December 2015

190

relative ineffectiveness in preventing
pregnancy and due to sample size concerns. We treat the use of no method as
an additional contraceptive choice because of theoretical reasons that are
discussed below.

METHODS

As we mentioned above, the analysis is carried out in two stages. In
the first, a logged-transformed waiting
time to coitus measure is entered in an
OLS regression on indicators of the
woman’s, and the couple’s relative
characteristics at the beginning of the
relationship. The logarithmic transformation is suggested by Weisberg
(1985) when the range of the dependent variable 1s very broad. Because
the log of zero is not defined, log (waiting time + 1) was the final transformation used in the analysis. The effect of
the logarithmic transformation is a
more normal distribution of waiting
time to coitus and a reduction in the
influence of outliers.

In the second stage of the analysis, a
series of logistic regression equations
are estimated. We first add a categorical length of waiting time variable to
the social-demographic individual level
model which predicts whether or not
a couple discussed contraceptive use.
Next, both waiting time and contraceptive communication variables are
added sequentially to the sociodemographic model to predict the use or nonuse of contraception. And finally, the
waiting time and contraceptive communication variables are entered into a
polytomous logistic regression model
predicting the method used by the
couple.

In the analysis with the dichotomous
variables (contraceptive communica
Tanfer and Hyle

Social Biology

tion: yes/no; contraceptive use/nonuse), logistic regression is used to estimate the effects of the imdependent
variables (Aldrich and Nelson, 1984).
In logistic regression, the dependent
variable is transformed into the natural
logarithm of the odds of being in one
category versus the other. The model
provides maximum likelihood estimates that fit independent variables to
a logistic response function (Hanushek
and Jackson, 1977). In the model with
a dichotomous dependent variable the
coefficients represent reductions or increases in the log odds of the conditional probability of being in one category of the dependent variable as
against the other. The coefficients are
interpreted relative to the omitted reference category of the predictor variable. Coefficients of 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0
are equal to metric odds of 1 to 1.6,
2.1, and 2.7, respectively. The coefficients in the polytomous logistic regression represent the log odds of
choosing one method relative to choosing another method (or no method).
For example, in predicting pill//IUD
use versus no method, for a specific
category of the predictor variable, a
beta coefficient of 0.70 indicates that
we are two times more likely to observe pill/IUD use than to observe no
contraception, for women in that category of the predictor variable. In contrast a beta coefficient of 0.40, for another category of the predictor, would
imply 1.5 times greater likelihood of
observing pill/IUD use compared to no
method. Thus, the beta coefficients
may be interpreted as the amount of
change in the log odds associated with
either a unit change in the predictor
variable, or being in one category versus another of the predictor variable.

In the method choice analysis we
treat “no method” as a competing
choice because it is not always clear
whether contraceptive intention (use/
nonuse) precedes method selection, or
if this is a joint decision. Since all methods except sterilization are reversible,
it is likely that those who face a contraceptive decision weigh the costs and
benefits of using different methods not
only against each other but also against
the risk of using no method at all
(Kahn et al., 1986; Stephen et al.,
1988). Therefore, the decision to contracept is conditionally based on the
availability of a desirable or acceptable
method.

RESULTS
DIFFERENTIALS IN WAITING TIME

The percentage distribution of the

time in months are shown according to
prior sexual experience status and relationship order in Table 1. On average, women who were virgins at the beginning of the first relationship wait
substantially longer (8.5 months) than
nonvirgins (3.1 months) before they
have intercourse with their partner.
Compared to virgin women, twice as
large a proportion of the women with
prior sexual experience have had intercourse with their partner in the same
month the relationship began. The
proportion of women waiting less than
one month steadily increases with each
subsequent relationship, and correspondingly, the average waiting time to
coitus sharply declines by relationship
order, from 7.5 months in the first relationship to 2.4 months in the second
relationship, and continues to decline
to about one month in the fourth relationship.

The bivariate relationships between
waiting time and each of the independent variables included in our conceptual model are shown in Table 2. The
two family background variables do
not appear to have any effect. Neither
family structure at age 15 nor mother’s
educational attainment seems to be associated with the length of the waiting
time. But, the older the woman, or her
partner, the shorter is the interval between the beginning of a relationship
and the timing of first coitus. The decline 1s sharpest after age 15, then-a
gradual reduction in the length of the
waiting time is observed. Educational
attainment, of both men and women
at the beginning of the relationship,
shows a similar pattern. We observe a
50 per cent reduction in waiting time
from less-than-high-school to highschool completion, followed by virtually no change in waiting time thereafter. This similarity between the patterns of the age and education effects is
not surprising, since age and education
are highly correlated at this stage of
the life cycle (r = 0.74 for women;
r = 0.54 for men).

The couple’s relative age and educational attainment, on the other hand,
show a weak association with waiting
time and not always in the expected
direction. When the partner is two or
more years older than the woman,
waiting time is reduced substantially.
Yet, when the partner’s education is
two or more years higher than that of
the woman, contrary to our hypothesis, the waiting time either increases or
is not affected at all. The waiting time
is shortest when the woman has two or
more years of schooling than her partner; but, only a small group of women
in this sample had more schooling than
their partner. Religious affiliation has a

Tanfer and Hyle

Social Biology

weak relationship with waiting time.
Protestant men and women seem to
wait longer than those who are Catholic, and they wait longer than men and
women who are affiliated with another
religion, or no religion, before they engage in sexual intercourse. Finally,
waiting time is significantly shorter if
the partner has prior marital experience. It should be noted, however, that
partner’s marital status is highly correlated with his age, and a very small proportion of the partners had ever been
married.

PREDICTING WAITING TIME

In the next stage, waiting time was
regressed on the woman’s and the couple’s relative characteristics (Table 3).
When only the woman’s characteristics
are included, waiting time is positively
influenced (i.e., increased) by the
mother’s education and negatively influenced (i.e., decreased) by the woman’s own education. The relationship
between religious affiliation and waiting time is still weak. The waiting time
is significantly shorter only for women
in the other or no-religion category.
Catholic and nonconservative Protestant women are not significantly different from conservative Protestant
women in terms of waiting time. In the
second model, the partner’s marital
status and the couple’s relative characteristics have both direct and indirect
effects on waiting time. The inclusion
of the partners’ relative characteristics
reduces the effect of the mother’s education, and the coefficient for the Catholic affiliation attains statistical significance. Waiting time is reduced if the
partner has any type of marital experience, or if he has a higher educational
attainment than the woman. The effect
on waiting time of religious homogamy

is as expected: Couples with the same
religious affiliation are likely to wait
longer before they engage in sexual intercourse than couples in which partners have different affiliations. This
effect is possibly a result of the reinforcement of the normative constraints
on premarital sexual behavior when
the partners’ beliefs coincide.

Because of its strong correlation
with the other variables, neither the
woman’s nor the partner’s relative age
was taken into account in the first two
models. The effect of this correlation
is demonstrated by the results of the
third model. The inclusion of the
woman’s age and the age homogamy
variables drastically reduces the effects

on waiting time of all the other variables in the first two models, with the
lone exception of the woman’s religion. The older a woman is at the time
the relationship began, the sooner she
tends to have intercourse with her partner. The couples’s age homogamy variable also has the expected effect on
waiting time, which is considerably
shorter if the male partner is two or
more years older than the female partner. It is noteworthy that, even though
the age effect dominates this model
and eliminates the significance of almost all of the other variables, the
amount of variation explained (R?) increases subtantially.

EFFECTS OF WAITING TIME

The effect of waiting time on the
likelihood of contraceptive communication between partners and on contraceptive use and method choice was
examined next. Our hypothesis regarding contraceptive communication was
that, the longer the waiting time to coitus, the more likely a couple is to discuss pregnancy prevention prior to
having intercourse. We tested this hypothesis by regressing a dichotomous
variable of whether or not the couple
discussed using contraception (yes/no)
on a categorical waiting time variable
(<1 month, 1-3 months, and >3
months), first without, and then with
controls for the woman’s, and the couple’s relative characteristics (Model 1
and Model 2, respectively). Waiting
time does not appear to have a significant effect on the likelihood of contraceptive communication (Table 4).
In the first model without controls,
couples who had intercourse in the
same month their relationship began

are less likely to have discussed using
contraception than couples who waited
one to three months. Couples who
waited longer than three months are
not any more likely to have discussed
pregnancy prevention than the couples
in the 1-3 months reference group.
The effect of the waiting time further
erodes when controls are introduced.
There is no significant difference in the
likelihood of having discussed contraceptive use between those who waited
less than one month and those who
waited longer, even though the signs
are in the expected direction. This does
not necessarily mean there is no relationship between waiting time and the
likelihood of contraceptive communication between partners. We may not
have been able to demonstrate it with
these data because the timing of this
communication is somewhat ambiguous. We can not be certain whether
or not the discussion of contraceptive
use actually preceded the couple’s first
intercourse. The absence of a more

196

precise measure of the waiting time
may also have contributed to this ambiguity.

The bivariate relationship between
waiting time and method choice is
shown in Table 5. The total proportion
of women who used a contraceptive
method, and pill, IUD, condom use increases with waiting time. The relatively high level of pill/IUD use (11 per
cent) among women who had intercourse within the first month of the first
relationship suggests that some women
enter into a relationship contraceptively prepared, anticipating to have
intercourse. Overall, there is some indication of increased efficiency in pregnancy prevention with longer waiting
time. Furthermore, the increase in
condom use with waiting time implies
relatively effective prophylaxis against
STDs, albeit unintentionally.

The net effect of the waiting time on
contraceptive use is tested by regressing a dichotomous use/nonuse variable
on: waiting time (Model 1a); waiting
time controlling for contraceptive communication (Model 1b); waiting time
controlling for woman’s and the couple’s relative characteristics (Model
2a); and, waiting time controlling for

Tanfer and Hyle

Social Biology

contraceptive communication and individual and relative characteristics of
the couple (Model 2b). In all four models, there is only weak support for the
hypothesized effect of waiting time on
the probability of contraceptive use at
first coitus (Table 6). There is a positive association between waiting time
and contraceptive use, particularly
when we control for the individual and
relative characteristics of the couple,
but these coefficients fail to attain
Statistical significance. Contraceptive
communication between the partners
is positively associated with contraceptive use, despite the ambiguity in the
temporal ordering of these two events.
Couples who have discussed pregnancy
prevention are nearly three times as
likely to have actually used a method
at first intercourse as couples who have
not discussed contraception. Also,
contraceptive communication appears
to mediate the effect of waiting time on
contraceptive use.

In the final step, we used polytomous logistic regression to examine the
effect of waiting time on contraceptive
method choice, where we also included
no method as one of the competing
choices available to women. As above,

we regressed a four-category method
choice variable on waiting time with
and without controlling for contraceptive communication, and woman’s and
the couple’s relative characteristics.
The results lend a weak support for our
hypothesis regarding the effect of waiting time on contraceptive use, but several patterns emerge.

First, longer waiting time to first intercourse (four months or longer) is
positively associated with pill or IUD
use. The likelihood of pill/IUD use is
substantially higher among women
who waited four months or more, especially when the effects of woman’s
and partner’s characteristics are controlled. For example, compared to the
women in the reference category,
women who waited at least four
months are nearly three times more
likely to use the pill or the IUD than to
use no method at all (Table 7, cols. 13
and 14). Likewise, women who waited

Waiting Time to Coitus

 

197

four or more months before engaging
in intercourse are more than twice as
likely to choose the pill or the IUD
over the condom, as women whose first
intercourse was within the first three
months of the relationship (Table 7,
cols. 19 and 20).

Second, short waiting time (less
than one month) appears to be inversely associated with the likelihood
of using condoms, especially in the absence of controls for individual and
relative characteristics. Women who
waited less than one month prior to the
first intercourse are more than twice
as likely to use no method than to use
condoms, relative to the reference
group of women who waited one to
three months before engaging in intercourse (Table 7, cols. 3, 4, and 15).
They also seem to be more likely tochoose a method other than the condom, if they do use a method at all (Table 7, cols. 7, 8, 11, and 12).

Third, as we observed above, there
appears to be a distinct group of
women among the nonwaiters who
Start a relationship already equipped
with an effective contraceptive method. This is apparent from the higher
likelihood of choosing the pill over
condom, even if the waiting time 1s less
than one month (Table 7, cols. 7, 8, 19,
and 20).

Fourth, regardless of waiting time,
contraceptive communication significantly increases the adoption of condom or other methods, but has no effect on the adoption of the pill or the
IUD (Table 7, cols. 4, 6, 16, 18, and
20). This finding makes intuitive sense
because pill and IUD are coitus independent female methods, for which
there is little need for discussion with
partner. Moreover, if the women begin
a relationship having already started
using the pill or the IUD, this would
further reduce the need for contraceptive communication. All other contraceptive methods are coitus dependent
and require partner participation or cooperation. Hence, contraceptive communication has a significant effect in
the adoption of these methods.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

The nonuse of contraception at first
intercourse among adolescents is a
well-documented finding in the adolescent sexuality research literature. The
various explanations share a common
underlying factor which centers on the
lack of time spent in courtship prior to
the beginning of a sexual relationship.
The present analysis provides a formal
test of the hypothesis that an increase
in the courtship period (i.e., waiting
time to intercourse) increases the likelihood that a couple will discuss con

199

traception, and use it at first intercourse.

The results suggest that the current
individual and relative characteristics
of the couples, and the prevailing
normative constraints have greater salience to the timing of the first intercourse than such background characteristics as mother’s education and
family structure. For instance, the
number of years of schooling is inversely associated with the length of
the waiting time. Partner’s higher education relative to that of the woman
also reduces the length of the waiting
time. Two factors may account for the
quickening of the pace of this transition. First, women with higher educational attainment are both better informed about reproduction and birth
control and more prepared for sexual
activity. Secondly, if the partner has
more schooling than the woman, he is
also likely to have a more dominant
role in the relationship. Thus, he can
be more persuasive in determining the
timing of the first intercourse. This
would be expected to have a depressing effect on waiting time, as seems to
be the case. Furthermore, affiliation
with conservative religious doctrines
that actively proscribe premarital sexual behavior tends to increase the
length of the courtship period. These
effects are tempered by age; older
women and women with older partners
tend to wait less.

There are mixed results concerning
the effect of waiting time on contraceptive behavior with weak support for
our hypotheses. The likelihood that a
couple will discuss contraception is not
affected significantly by the length of
the courtship period that precedes sexual intercourse. The effect of waiting
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:44 08 December 2015

200

time on contraceptive behavior is in
the expected direction. There is some
evidence that longer waiting time increases not only contraceptive use but
also the likelihood of pill and IUD use.
We have also found evidence that
some women enter the relationship already using the pill or the IUD, possibly because they expect to have intercourse. For these women, waiting time
is irrelevant in terms of contraception.
The inherent inaccuracies in the measurement of its timing notwithstanding, contraceptive communication is
strongly associated with the adoption
of coitus-dependent methods that require partner cooperation.

There are various reasons why some
of these results are not more robust
and conclusive. One possible reason
for the absence of a significant relationship between waiting time and contraceptive communication may have been
the lack of specificity in the timing of
the discussion regarding contraception. It was not always clear that the
variable measured contraceptive communication prior to first intercourse.
Other concerns are data quality and
measurement issues. For example, the
date of the beginning of a relationship
is seldom punctuated by a salient
event. Therefore, it is especially vulnerable to recall errors. Consequently,
the required precision in the waiting
time measure may be diminished. Partner characteristics, if and when contraception was discussed, whether or not
a method was used, and what method
was chosen are all subject to similar
distortions caused by inaccurate recall.

In addition, the measurement of
waiting time in months, rather than in
smaller units (e.g., days), yields a leftskewed distribution, resulting in a loss
of variation. The exclusion from the

Tanfer and Hyle

Social Biology

analysis of women whose first-ever intercourse was outside a long-term relationship (1=93) may have also stabilized some of the variation by waiting
time in the contraceptive behavior patterns. These women would not have
waited long before they engaged in
sexual intercourse; a great majority of
them would not have used a method at
first intercourse (68 per cent); and a
very small minority would have used
the pill or the IUD (9 per cent), or condoms (8 per cent).

Nonetheless, these data support the
existence of a relationship between
waiting time to coitus and pregnancy
risk-taking. Waiting time has an influence on a couple’s ability to prepare
themselves for sexual intercourse. The
longer the waiting time, the more
likely a couple is to use contraception
at first intercourse, and the more likely
they are to choose an effective method.
Future analyses should take this and
other aspects of the courtship period
into account when examining contraceptive behavior. The confirmation of
these relationships would facilitate targeting high-risk populations for pregnancy, and disease-prevention interventions.
