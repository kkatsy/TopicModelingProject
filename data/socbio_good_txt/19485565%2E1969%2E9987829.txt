Population Differences in Tear Duct Size

Implications of Relaxed Selection

R. H. Post

Department of Human Genetics
University of Michigan Medical School
Ann Arbor, Michigan

Data have been reported recently indicating larger average size of the orbital opening
of the tear duct (naso-lacrimal canal) in
skull samples of American colored than in
American white skulls of corresponding sex
and age (Post, 1969). Male skulls had slightly larger ducts than female skulls; older
skulls (over age 50) had very slightly larger
canals than those of younger adults. Variances corresponded with means, being notably greater for American colored than for
white, slightly greater for males than for
females, and very slightly greater for skulls
of older individuals. The canals of the
American colored samples were also shorter
in length and straighter in course than those
of whites. These results confirm several
earlier reports, none of which included
metric data. (Martin, 1928, Vol. I, p. 270).

Since the excess in size of the American
colored contrasted with the white tear ducts
was considerable, it seemed worthwhile to
investigate samples from additional populations, and to seek possible explanations of
the more notable population differences.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Skulls were examined in two museums
and two medical schools in the United

 

States and in five locations abroad as listed
below according to the population samples
available and the provenience and number
of skulls,

U.S. National Museum, Washington, D.C.:
Aleuts: Aleutian Islands, Bering Sea (94).
American Indians: Utah (31), Louisiana (14).
Australia: aborigines from central and north
ern Australia (20).

Hope (17), Seward Peninsula (5),
Yukon River (26).
Hawaiians: (106).
Melanesia: Papuan-Melanesians (Oceanic Negroes) from New Hebrides (22),
New Britain (Gazelle Peninsula,
24), and Solomon Islands (6).

American colored and white skulls (macerated) of the Terry Collection, subsequently removed to the U.S. National Museum. Medical
records available include sex, age at death, race,
and in many cases additional information.
Skulls were divided arbitrarily into two age
groups: “Young” adults, 15 to 49; and “Old,”
over 50. American colored female skulls were
too few to warrant reporting.

Measurement of the size of the superior
opening of the lacrimal duct in the orbit was
made by comparison with a series of holes in
a small metal sheet, standardized for
measuring the sizes of knitting needles. This
method is more accurate and more rapid
than measurement by sliding caliper. Classification categories are in terms of square
millimeters of cross-sectional area of each
canal opening, rather than diameter, as
follows:

Social Biology

Size Diameter
Number (mm.) Area (mm.)
1 3.2 10.24
2 3.5 12,.25
3 3.8 14.44
4 4.1 16. 81
5 4.5 20.25
6 4,9 24.01
7 5.3 28.09
8 5.8 33.64
9 6.3 39.69
10 7.0 49.00
11 8.0 64.00
12 9.0 81.00

Duct openings which depart from circular shape present obvious difficulties, but
they can be measured far more accurately
by this method than by sliding caliper. The
shapes of ducts were classified arbitrarily as
round or not round. Most of the latter are
oval; some, elliptical.

RESULTS

Complete data are presented in Table 1,
in categories ranging from Size 1 through
Size 12. Sex and side (left and right) are distinguished, each with its sample size (N.O.).
The number of skulls of each sample is also
noted (N.S.). Discrepancies between these
figures are due to ducts which are unilaterally missing or badly damaged. Determinations of sex are based on museum records
when available; otherwise on the author’s
estimate, which proved 79% accurate in a
test of skulls with medical records. No
measurements of length of tear duct are reported since these have not proven accurate
(Post, 1969).

The principal conclusion of the previous
paper (Post, 1969) is clearly substantiated
by comparisons between pooled samples of
African Negroes with Caucasians, The
smaller means and higher variabilities of
Caucasian tear duct sizes are significant at
probability levels well below one tenth of
one per cent for left and right sides of both
sexes. Data for left and right sides are considered separately since statistical correction for their intercorrelation would be

laborious; sexes are considered separately
to avoid correction, which would also be
laborious.

Since small size has an important functional significance, due to greater risk of
infection, as discussed below, populations
are compared in the numbers or frequencies
of ducts which fall below a particular size
category. The significance of population
differences is then estimated by chisquare tests. For example, to compare the
numbers of African and Caucasian males of
left tear duct Size 7 and smaller, we make
a two-by-two table from data in Table 1,
pooling the four samples of American and
European whites and three samples of West
Coast Africans (see Table 2).

Comparison between African Negroes and
pooled Caucasians of either sex at any
threshold of size leads to the same conclusion,

To facilitate survey of the data presented
in Table 1, some of the samples have been
arbitrarily pooled and summarized in Table
3, combining lefts with rights. Here the
Caucasians are clearly differentiated from
all other populations, in both sexes, by
excessive numbers of ducts of smaller size.
As rough criteria, one may scan the modes,
which are italicized, or compare the numbers in and below any specific size. Caucasians have the largest frequencies of
small ducts at any threshold.

suggested, but none is of statistical significance, The American colored are intermediary between Caucasians and nonCaucasians, closely approaching the former
in the large sample of males but departing
further from them in the smaller sample of
females. Some of the other samples have
higher frequencies of small ducts, depending
on how the comparisons are appraised. At
the other end of the range the Eskimo and

both “Young” and “Old”; Central Europeans; Eastern Europeans; and modern
Egyptians. Only four non-Caucasian samples approach them in their monopoly of
small-sized ducts: one sample of 23 Australian aborigine males (in the American
Museum of Natural History); 23 Chinese
females; and the Hawaiian males and females.

The Caucasians’ excess of small ducts is
evident at any threshold. Thus for ‘‘Size 4

not differentiated sufficiently to demonstrate statistical significance.

The modes of the samples in Table 3 are
ranked by size, from larger to smaller, in
Table 4.

The other basis for ranking, on the principle of specific size thresholds (ignoring
instances of a few cases of “‘stragglers’’),
gives fairly similar results as shown in
Table 5.

the outstanding result of the present study

other samples of skulls of either sex (excluding samples of Chinese, American colored,

feature is the shape of the superior opening,
which may be classified most simply as
“round” or ‘not round.” No significant difference in the frequencies of these forms is
found between the sexes or populations.
Some of the samples of Caucasians have
very slightly lower frequencies of round
openings, while African Negroes, PapuanMelanesians, Peruvian Indians, Eskimos,
and Aleuts have slightly higher frequencies
of round openings than usual. The differ

anterior crest, while in Peruvian Indian
skulls the posterior crests are notable. Individual variation is lower in these three populations than in any other.

Eskimo and Aleuts are further distinguished by the thinness of their lacrimal
bones; Africans and Melanesians, by the
small size of their lacrimals (Martin, 1928).

All of the non-Caucasian skulls except
those of the Terry and Howard University
collections were collected before the turn of

ences are too small to distinguish these
population samples statistically. On the
other hand, curiously enough, discordance
or difference in the shape of the duct between the left and right sides is notably
greater in Caucasian samples than in
others, and notably less frequent in Eskimo
and Aleut samples, as discussed below.

A second morphological feature of importance is the development of the lacrimal
crest. Both the anterior and the posterior
crests are more frequently larger in all dimensions, and more uniform, among Aleuts
and Eskimos. This is particularly true of the

Caucasians

the century and are considered to be virtually unmixed (without Caucasian ancestry).

ASYMMETRY

Since populations are known to vary in

Tables 1 or 2 since in many skulls the duct
of one side is damaged or missing.

In size asymmetry the males fall into two
fairly clearly defined classes (Table 6, percentages ‘‘Not 0”). Among males, the four
samples with highest frequencies are, respectively, modern Egyptians (69%), American whites (65%), Chinese in the U.S.
National Museum (58%), and mixed Europeans (57%). All four have had long histories of post-Paleolithic culture-habitat.
The others, ranging from 47% downwards,
are of “primitive” culture-habitat except for
the Chinese sample in the American Museum of Natural History. The dichotomy
between the first and second groups of males

the dichotomy is clear for both sexes
(Table 8). Contrasting pooled Eskimo and
Aleuts with ‘‘Young” American whites,
which resemble them more closely in age,
the higher frequency of asymmetry among
the latter is of statistical significance for females as well as for males (Table 9).

The selective disadvantage of most asymmetries is slight, yet they should not be
overlooked in an appraisal of maladaptations.

DISCUSSION

Little is known about the physical anthropology of the tear duct, in contrast with
the fairly large number of studies of the
lacrimal bone, which is considered the most

is highly significant statistically (Table 8).
The female distributions do not always
parallel the males; nor do females reflect the
dichotomy when the samples of each group
are pooled (Table 8). The two highest frequencies are among Pueblo Indians (65%)
and Hawaiians (60%). Other high frequencies (54% to 57%) include the American
whites of the Terry Collection, Egyptians,
Chinese, and Papuan-Melanesians. The remaining samples (48% and below) include
three “primitive” populations—Australians
(37%), West Africans (48%), and Eskimo
(46%); also, the Peruvian Indians (32%),
mixed modern Europeans (42%), and Neolithic Europeans (37%). The inclusion of
prehistoric Caucasian skulls within the
range of ‘‘primitives” is noteworthy.

highly variable bone in the skull in size,
shape, position, thickness, and sutural pattern (Macalister, 1884; Zabel, 1900; Martin,
1928). High variability of the tear duct in
size is evident from the data here reported,
even without estimating the variances.
Among “primitives,” in the first eight
samples of Table 3, most of the male skulls
fall into five categories of size, from Size 6,
through Size 10, inclusive. The diameters of
the two extreme classes are, respectively, 4.9
and 7 mm. Since the function of a duct is
represented more realistically by its area of
cross-section, these figures may be squared,
becoming respectively 24 and 49 square
millimeters, one double the other. Corresponding figures for male Caucasian duct
sizes are 16.8 and 49, almost triple one
another. Few anthropometric measurements

reveal as great variation. Non-metric variation is even greater, much of it obviously
maladaptive.

The question of association between tear
duct size and face length has arisen (Post,
1969). Although no measurement was made
of face length in this study, the possibility of
such association may be discounted by the
fact that Peruvian Indians and Pueblo
Indians typically have short faces (Martin,
1928), yet the tear ducts of these samples are
large.

It might be questioned whether duct size
is a function of orbit size. The suggestion
arises from the parallel between the larger
overall skull size of males and the larger duct
sizes among males in most of the samples
(even though the reverse is found among the
Australian aborigines, and no sex difference
is evidenced among the Papuan-Melanesians). Since sex differences in orbit size are
negligible (Martin, 1928), this association
may also be discounted.

The height and breadth of orbits of the
Central European skulls were measured
with sliding calipers. Scattergrams of duct
size with each of these measurements indicate completely random distribution. A
third scattergram, between duct size and the
product of orbital height times orbital
breadth, also shows no association.

Explanation of the excess of smallersized ducts among Caucasians has been
sought in every conceivable direction. No
suggestion of ecological adaptation is evident, considering each of the various niches
of climate represented by the samples under
review—arctic, temperate, subtropical desert, tropical desert, and tropical humid. No
sample is clearly distinguishable one from
another except the Caucasian, and to a
lesser degree the American colored, which
may be attributed to their fraction of Caucasian ancestry. Resemblance between the
climate of the homelands of Caucasians and
those of some of the samples with low fre

quencies of small ducts adds to the improbability of an explanation based on adaptive specialization.

MALADAPTATION IN THE TEAR DUCT

The naso-lacrimal canal normally carries
a small but constant movement of fluid from
the eye into the nose, performing the double
function of relieving the eye of excesses
which otherwise would spill out (epiphora,
or chronic tear flowing) and conserving the
tear fluid, which is in constant demand by
the mucous membrane of the nose. With its
rich supply of the enzyme lysozyme, tear
fluid has marked bacteriostatic properties
which are valuable to eyes and nose alike,

ing which female cases become considerably
more numerous, about 5:1 (Traquair, 1941,
p. 166; Stallard, 1965, p. 280), which is generally attributed to mucosal shrinkage.
Duke-Elder (1952) believes this ratio is
approximated in the British population at
large, but there may be sociological biases
in favor of females. The incidence of epiphora and dacryocystitis in Britain among
adults at some time of life has been estimated at 3.7% by Foster (1956, p. 144) and
at 2.7% by Traquair (1941, p. 165), based
on large numbers of patients in eye clinics.
It is clear that morphological variation
of the bony housing of the duct is extremely
high. This has been described by a number

supplementing the less concentrated secretions of the nasal mucosa.

Anatomical obstructions in the lacrimal
canal of adults usually produce infection and
symptoms (called dacryocystitis, inflammation of the lacrimal excretory system) as
well as epiphora. Congenital cases are
surprisingly common, but rarely serious,
almost always correcting themselves spontaneously before the onset of tears at three
to four weeks. Most congenital cases are
attributed to delayed rupture of delicate
membranes within the canal, which normally disappear very soon after birth, or to imperfect openings of the inflow papillae.
Childhood and adolescent cases are infrequent, most of the serious cases arising at
ages over thirty. There is no sex difference

of anatomists and surgeons, notably by
Schaeffer (1912¢, p. 20-21; 19120; 1920, p.
256-257) and Garfin (1942, p. 169). The
inferior ostium varies even more than the
superior in both size and shape, particularly
in position. The inferior ostium rarely assumes a simple shape, such as round or oval;
it may be lunate, pentagonal, slit-like, hourglass-shaped, or even double. Cases of bifurcated canals with double openings are
not rare, and some triple openings have been
reported. In one case the ostium was located above rather than bel.w the concha.
Dissections of the canal course have revealed
even greater variation, irregular constrictions and broadenings being the rule rather
than the exception, together with all types
of unevenness, including bulges or diverticula, usually of exotic shapes. The largest

appendices often terminate in an aborted
ostium. Embryological studies reveal unusual variation at the earliest stages of development (Schaeffer, 1920, p. 237-258;
Schwarz, 1934), which points to genetic control. None of this variation can be considered functional. It reflects a very low
level of adaptability, and may be aptly
described as ‘‘evolutionary nonsense.” Unfortunately, all published studies of such
variation are of whites.

RELAXED SELECTION

Only one hypothesis can be offered to explain the near monopoly of small tear ducts
by Caucasians: diminished efficacy of natural selection in eliminating genetic variants
of small size, concomitant with changes in
the culture-habitat of Caucasians many generations ago, which has permitted the accumulation of genes contributing to small
size. Support for the theory may be at
present spotty, but it merits consideration.

Dacryocystitis has been reported as extremely rare among Negroes, contrasted
with Caucasians, in two biracial eye clinic
samples (Santos-Fernandez, 1921; Garfin,
1942). Medical literature has been searched
in vain for further references to population
frequencies of this disease. Foster states that
it is “agreed” that Negroes suffer “scarcely
at all” (1956, p. 143). Several ophthalmologists with large multiracial practices have
stated privately to the author that dacryocystitis is almost unknown outside of

- whites, yet among almost all their cases the

environmental and occupational positions
of the nonwhites expose them more frequently to infection.

Association between dacryocystitis and
smaller lumen of the bony canal has not
been thoroughly investigated, in contrast
with the large literature on duct stenosis of
mucosal tissue. While it seems reasonable to
assume that smaller ducts would occasion
greater risks of infection, and while no

 

Social Biology

ophthalmologist has challenged this assumption among some dozen whose opinion
the writer has sought, no published data
have been found on the subject. The avsumption is substantiated by the higher
frequencies of infection among females,
whose canals run to smaller sizes than
males’, Higher frequencies of dacryocystitis
among females than males has been reported
even among selected patients suffering from
mucosal duct obstruction (Dalgleish, 1967,
p. 465).

The genetic basis of small-size bony ducts
has not been investigated, and this is indeed
a great weakness of the relaxation hypothesis, Family histories of dacryocystitis
have been reported widely (Traquair, 1941;
Sorsby, 1951, p. 196, 1953, p. 367; Viers,
1955, p. 73; Foster, 1956; Waardenburg,
1961, Part 6, Chap. 4, p. 295-297; and
others). However, since members of a
family share their environment as well as
their heredity, such studies cannot yet be
considered proof of genetic control.

Since the size of the bony canal is difficult
to determine in the living, we cannot be
optimistic about the prospects for making
family history investigations of undersized
ducts, and must be satisfied with population
studies. These are at least suggestive of relaxed selection. The excess of small ducts
among Caucasian skulls compared with
those of all other populations—roughly 3
per cent, from scanning Table 3—is not far
from the frequency of dacryocystitis among
Caucasian eye patients.

It is interesting to note the close resemblance in the distribution of duct sizes
between Neolithic and modern European
skulls in both sexes. This suggests that relaxation in the vigor of natural selection
against small size may have taken place a
very long time ago, since the present samples
of Neolithic skulls are only 3,500 to 5,000
years old, and undoubtedly had many generations of post-Paleolithic culture-habitat

behind them. From our knowledge of contemporary “primitive” or Paleolithic culture-habitats it seems reasonable to assume
that particular stress is imposed by infection and disease. In contrast, even the
simplest of Neolithic people had definite advantages: a more stable supply of food and
better storage of food, permitting the sick to
be less rigorously driven to seeking food;
shelter from storms and excesses of climate;
larger groups of people, permitting more co
= operation. Selection pressures must have

been substantially reduced during early
Neolithic times, and presumably have been
cumulatively reduced ever since.

Finally, the high variability in form and
size of tear ducts and the high frequencies
of obviously malformed tear ducts among
Caucasians point strongly to relaxed selection. It is unfortunate that similar studies

have not been made as yet on other populations.
