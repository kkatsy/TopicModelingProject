A reproductive span and reproductive efficiency. In addition to nutrition, other environmental or endogenous factors may
also be important, such as slower growth
due to altitude (Frisch and Revelle, 1970,
1971a) or genetically determined slower
rates of growth (Frisch, 1972). All these
factors may interact with each other (Figure 1) and with cultural practices affecting fertility, such as a taboo on intercourse

during lactation (Short, 1974). For simplicity, the effects of only the most important variable, nutrition, will be related to
each reproductive milestone shown in Figure 1.

VIABILITY OF THE INFANT

Starting at the beginning of the cycle
(Figure 1), the survival of the infant, the
most important determinant of reproductive success, is directly correlated with
birth weight; the higher the birth weight,
the better the infant’s chance of survival
(Frisch, 1972). The birth weight of the
infant, is correlated with the prepregnancy
weight of the mother and her weight gain
during pregnancy, each acting independently and with additive effects (Eastman
and Jackson, 1968). The events of the
adolescent growth spurt and the minimal
weights necessary for the onset and maintenance of normal menstrual cycles determine that the prepregnancy weight of the
mother is in a particular weight range,
representing a critical body composition.

Fic. 1-~-The biological determinants of female fecundity. Each reproductive milestone can be affected
by environmental factors, as shown. The maintenance of regular ovulatory cycles is related to a minimum level of fat storage and is thus directly affected by undernutrition and energy-draining activities,

such as lactation.

than normal prenatal growth (Frisch,
1971; Frisch and Revelle, 1971a), will
determine the time of onset of the adolescent growth spurt, since it has been shown
that spurt initiation is related to the attainment of an average critical weight
(about 30 kg. in United States girls), representing a particular body composition
(Frisch and Revelle, 19716; Frisch et al.,
1973).

Well-nourished middle-class girls in the
United States initiate the adolescent
growth spurt on the average at 9.5 years
(Frisch and Revelle, 19715). However, in
Belgium in 1835, children grew more
slowly because of poorer nutrition and
child care, and the average age of initiation of the adolescent spurt of girls was
about 12 years (Quetelet, 1869).

MENARCHE

The interval from initiation of the .
growth spurt to menarche is completed in
an average of three years for well-nourished
United States and European girls (Frisch
and Revelle, 1971a). Belgian girls of over
a century ago apparently grew more slowly
during the adolescent spurt, as well as
before the spurt, so that this interval to
menarche was about 4.5 years (Quetelet,
1869).

Menarche normally follows the period
of most rapid weight gain (peak weight
velocity shown in Figure 1) and takes
place on the average at 47 kg. for United
States, English, Finnish, Dutch, and Belgian girls. At present, this weight is attained by these girls between 12.8 and
13.0 years (Frisch, 1975), as was also

true three or four decades ago (Frisch
and Revelle, 1970, 19712). However, in
1895, United States girls attained that
mean weight at 14 years and in 1835 Belgian girls attained that weight at 16.5
years (Frisch, 1972).

Girls more than double their stored fat
during the adolescent growth spurt, as a
study of the components of the critical
weight showed. The mean weight at menarche represents a body weight composition of about 20-24 per cent fat, which is
attained at varying heights and weights
within a population (Frisch, 1974; Frisch
et al., 1973.)

MINIMUM WEIGHTS FOR MENARCHE

A minimum level of fatness, about 17
per cent of body weight, is associated with
the onset of menstrual cycles and their
continued maintenance soon after menarche. Menstrual function ceases when the
body weight composition falls below that
fatness level, corresponding usually to a
loss of weight in the range of 10-15 percent, and is restored with weight gain
above the minimum fatness level (Frisch

‘and McArthur, 1974; Crisp and Stonehill,

1971).

STABLE REPRODUCTIVE ABILITY

A heavier minimum weight for height,
representing an increased amount of fat,
about 22 per cent of body weight, is necessary for the maintenance of regular menstrual function in girls and women age 16
years and over. For example, the minimum
weight for onset of menses for a woman
18 years old whose height is 165 cm. (55
inches) is 49 kg. (108 lbs.), whereas the
minimum weight for a girl 14 years old
of the same height is only 43.5 kg. (96
Ibs.). These heavier minimum weights reflect the increase in fatness which takes
place in both early and late maturing girls

from menarche to ages 16-18 (Frisch and
McArthur, 1974).

Menstrual function stops in girls and
women ages 16 years and over when body
weight falls below the minimum fatness
level and is restored following a gain in
body weight sufficient to restore fatness
above the minimum level. These fat
changes correspond to a change in body
weight of 10-15 per cent. One would then
expect that marginally nourished women
would have irregular menstrual cycles, as
has been observed (Solien de Gonzalez,
1964), and that in severe undernutrition,
menstrual cycles would cease completely,
as has also been observed (Frisch and
McArthur, 1974).

ADOLESCENT STERILITY

These findings suggest that the period
of adolescent sterility after menarche,
when many menstrual cycles are anovulatory (Short, 1974) and when there is
greater pregnancy wastage (National
Academy of Sciences, 1970), may last until stable body composition at high fat
storage levels is attained (Figure 1). Interestingly, there is continued rapid growth
of the ovary and uterus during this interval (Scammon, 1930).

These data also suggest that undernutrition would lengthen the period of adolescent sterility. In a well-nourished population, the adolescent sterility interval is
now about 3.5 years, from 12.9 - 0.1 years
at menarche to 16-18 years on the average,
judging from the leveling off of changes in
body composition (Frisch and McArthur,
1974) and from the pregnancy wastage
data (National Academy of Sciences,
1970). However, the interval may be 4.5
to 5 years at present in an undernourished
population, and it: may have also been that
long in the past. One would then expect
that a late age of menarche, for example,
16.5 years as found in the middle of the

20 Frisch

nineteenth century (Tanner, 1962; Backman, 1948), would be associated with a
rather late age at birth of the first child,
such as 22 or 23 years.

LACTATIONAL AMENORRHEA

The idea that a minimum level of stored
energy is required for the maintenance of
regular ovulatory menstrual cycles can explain variation in the length of lactational
amenorrhea, a major determinant of birth
interval in many populations (Short,
1974). Lactation has very high energy
demands, requiring about 1,000 calories
per day (FAO, 1957). Short (1974) points
out that lactation is a much greater nutritional stress than pregnancy, because
the mammary gland transfers energy from
mother to offspring with less efficiency
than does the umbilical cord.

The breast milk of undernourished
women does not differ in calories or protein from the breast milk provided by
well-nourished women, although the
amount may decrease seriously when the
mother is severely undernourished, and
the vitamin content may be inadequate
(Frisch, 1971). Thus, the undernourished
woman draws on her own energy stores for
the provision of adequate food for the
growth and development of her infant.
An undernourished woman would therefore
be slower to regain the minimum energy
levels required for the restoration of ovulatory cycles.

Pregnancy has high energy requirements; about 50,000 extra calories are
needed to maintain a pregnancy to term
(Frisch, 1975). About 120,000 extra calories are needed for lactation over a minimum period of four months. Thus, a poorly
nourished woman would be expected to
have a Jonger period of amenorrhea while
lactating than a well-nourished woman, as
has been actually observed (Short, 1974;
Solien de Gonzalez, 1964.)

Social Biology

The weight of the mother at the time
of her attainment of stable reproductive
ability, which we have seen has been determined to be above a predictable minimum level of fatness, affects the birth
weight of the baby, and thus the cycle
begins all over again (Figure 1).

AGE TO MENOPAUSE

One more time interval must be added
to complete the reproductive span—the
time to menopause. Menopause is earlier
in undernourished populations than in
well-nourished populations, although there
is apparently no individual correlation between time of menarche and time of menopause (McMahon and Worcester, 1966).
The factors involved are still not known,
although it is tempting to speculate that
the loss of lean body weight which begins
in American women at age 45 (Forbes,
1972) has something to do with the time
of menopause, just as a change in the
fat/lean ratio may be associated with
menarche (Frisch et al., 1973; McCance
and Widdowson, 1974).

CONCLUSION

When the observed fertility rate of a
population is lower than is normally found
in a well-nourished noncontracepting population—for example, the lower rate found
in India (Gopalan and Naidu, 1972; Wyon
and Gordon, 1971) or among the Bushman
(Singer and Weiner, 1963), as compared to
that among the well-nourished Hutterites
(Short, 1974)—the lower fertility could be
explained wholly or in part by inadequate
nutrition causing delayed menarche, longer
than normal adolescent sterility, irregularity or cessation of menstrual function,
higher pregnancy wastage, longer lactational amenorrhea, and early menopause.

Therefore, Figure 2 adds a new pathway
to Wrigley’s diagram (1969) of the effect
of nutrition on fertility. In addition to the

A new pathway, drawn with a broken line,

fecundity, which lowers or raises fertility.

food available per head affecting mortality,
and thus fertility, the food available per
head can affect fecundity and thus fertility.

One can therefore ask: Is the lowerthan-expected fertility observed in some
developing countries at present and in
many populations historically—for example, in eighteenth-century Norway
(Drake, 1969)—due entirely to the use
of coitus interruptus and “folk” methods
of contraception, as is usually assumed?

21

Suppose that such methods are actually
not widely used and that the frequency of
abortion is Jow, as McKeown and Brown
(1955) suggest may have been the case
historically. An alternate explanation for
the lowered fertility could be low fecundity for all the reasons outlined above,
interacting with cultural taboos that also
decrease fertility. Policy decisions on contraception would be much affected if the
alternate explanation is true, entirely or
in part.

An important biological question also
remains to be answered. What body composition does the critical weight of other
races and ethnic groups represent? We
know that the critical weights of races do
differ; for example, the Japanese are about
6 kg. lighter at peak velocity, which precedes menarche, than are United States
girls (Frisch and Revelle, 1969). What
we do not know is the body composition
at the different critical weights of other
population groups. Perhaps they are more
efficient reproducers and reproduce well
with a much lower percentage of fat in
relation to their body weight.

These questions await future research
on the biological determinants of fecundity in contemporary and historical populations.
