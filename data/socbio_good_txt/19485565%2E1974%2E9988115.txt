A Re-examination of the Heritability of

Fertility in the British Peerage

Louise A. Williams* and B. J. Williams

Department of Anthropology

Los Angeles, California

In 1930, R. A. Fisher estimated the
genetic component of the variance in fertility to be 40 per cent. This estimate has
been extensively cited and has served as a
stimulus for other studies of the inheritance of fertility (Huestis and Maxwell,
1932; Bresard, 1950; Berent, 1953; Beckman and Elston, 1962; Imaizumi et al.,
1970; Neel and Schull, 1972). Fisher’s
data source for this estimate was Karl
Pearson’s analysis of fertility correlations
in the British peerage. It is the purpose of
this paper to replicate Pearson’s sampling
procedures as closely as possible to determine whether this estimate of the
genetic component of the inheritance of
fertility is valid. This re-examination of
the data is based on the suspicion that a
secular change in fertility occurred in this
period which could result in spurious correlations between parent and offspring fertilities,

Pearson et al. (1899), using Burke’s
Peerage, Baronetage, and Knightage, plus
local birth and marriage records, extracted
one thousand cases for his investigation of
the correlation between sibship size and
progeny number in human populations.

His results are reprinted in Table 1. The
means are indicated by M, standard deviations by o, and Pearson’s product-moment
correlation by r. Subscripts indicate sons
(s), fathers (f), daughters (d), mothers
(m), and paternal grandmothers (g).
Fisher used Pearson’s results to estimate
the genetic variance in fertility. His reasoning involved three alternative approaches. First, since the correlation of
the fertility of the granddaughters with
their paternal grandmother’s is half that
of the granddaughters with their mothers,
%7q = 0.1123, and rmg == 0.2096 (Table 1),
he reasoned that this correlation is one
argument for a strong genetic component.
In polygenic traits, one would expect the
correlation to be halved in each succeeding generation. Second, the covariance between the fertilities of the mothers and
daughters is 20.9 per cent of the variance
observed in the daughters. In traits wholly
determined by genes, the covariance would
be half of the variance; therefore, 41.8
per cent of the observed variance in fertility may be due to heredity. Third, it is
possible to divide the square of the parentchild correlation by the grandparent-grandchild correlation because the parent-child
correlation represents half of the additive

genetic variance while the grandparentgrandchild correlation represents a fourth
of the additive genetic variance. Thus, the
quotient (1/2V,)?/1/4V, should give a
measure of the heritability of the trait.
This approach, (0.2096)?7/0.1123 = 39.1
per cent, and the preceding approach both
ascribe approximately 40 per cent of the
variance in fertility to a genetic component (Fisher, 1930).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In order to replicate Pearson’s sample
as closely as possible, the 97th edition of
Burke’s Peerage (1939) was consulted by
first drawing a number from a random
numbers table and then sampling every
tenth page thereafter. Burke’s Peerage plus
local birth and death records were the
sources for Pearson’s study. Unfortunately,
it was not possible to obtain data on females since in about 98 per cent of the
cases only marriage dates and not birth
dates are given for females. Since Pearson
had computed correlations on males and

since we wanted to use a comparable data
source, the analysis was undertaken on
males only. Pearson used sons and daughters who had been married at least fifteen
years at the time he did the research.
Since generation length was approximately thirty years in the British peerage,
we began by sampling grandparent cohorts
born from 1740 to 1800. The sample contains grandsons who had completed their
fertility by the 1880's, the period in which
Pearson did his research. Pearson (1899)
admits that, in some cases, he sampled
more than one child per family; however,
he did not state what proportion of his
sample consisted of sibs, so our sample is
restricted to only one child per family. Our
sample contains at least one man in either
the first, second, or third generation who
held a title. For example, on a given page
a family name was selected, then the
bearer of the title born between 1740 and
1800 was chosen. If he was fertile and his
son and grandson were fertile, that set
of three generations was chosen. These

sons and grandsons were not always title
holders; even if they were title holders
they were not always first-born sons.

If, for example, the title passed to a
nephew in the second generation, the
nephew’s line was traced backwards and
forwards one generation each way in order
to obtain a three generation sample. This
slanted the sample toward the more fertile
members of the peerage as well as toward
men who had at least one son. Pearson’s
data are also biased in this way because he
examined correlations between fathers and
sons, and between mothers and daughters
and granddaughters.

Our sample also contains a disproportionate number of families who had been
members of the peerage for a long time.
Newly titled families often had to be rejected because there was no information
on the sibship size of a man born in the
first generation cohort. In these cases, another family on the same’ page or the next
page had to be sampled.

Heritability of Fertility

227

Variables available for analysis were
sibship size (total number of children in
the family), birth date (of the male), marriage date (of the male) and progeny
number (total number of offspring ever
born). Total offspring born, fertility, and
progeny number are used interchangeably
in this paper.

RESULTS

The correlation matrices were computed
for sibship size and progeny number for
each generation within each lineage. Then
each individual was treated as an independently sampled case and the correlation
of each individual’s sibship size with
progeny number computed. The correlations are shown in Table 2. Although the
correlations are not significantly different
from zero, they are close to those obtained
by Pearson (Table 1).

Since the data were randomly selected in
blocks of related individuals from three
generations, treating each individual as an

independent variate should be viewed with
caution; however, it was a necessary procedure to ascertain the effects of secular
change and to control for the effect of
several different generations being represented in one cohort. Also, it is not clear
from Pearson’s discussion whether he may
have manipulated the data in a similar
manner. It would have been exceedingly
difficult for him to obtain 1,000 cases without disregarding lineal descent. For example, in our sample the first generation
of each lineage included males born from
1740 to 1800. The environments of the
ten-year birth cohort from 1740 to 1749,
and that of 1790 to 1800, might have been
very dissimilar.

Partial correlations were computed for
the lineages and for the expanded sample.
Progeny number was the dependent variable; sibship size, marriage date, marriage
age, and birth date were the independent
variables. The multiple correlations, variables contributing the most to the multiple
correlations, and the F-statistic levels to
remove the effects of the independent variables are listed in Table 2. There appears
to be a secular change. Sibship size is important in the first generation, but marriage date is the variable contributing
most of the variance in the multiple correlations in the two succeeding generations. When the partial correlation was
computed for the expanded sample, marriage date contributed most of the variance
in progeny number (Table 2).

Given the evidence from correlations
and partial correlations, there is an additional method of analysis. One-way analysis of variance was computed on sibship
size, progeny number, and age at marriage
with groups divided into ten-year birth
cohorts.

Fertility, i.e., mean number of offspring,
changed through time, but marriage age
did not. This points even more strongly

Social Biology

to a secular trend in fertility. The heritability of fertility is not comparable from
one generation to the next because one
cannot assume a constant environment.

DISCUSSION

Fisher (1930) acknowledged the impact
of the beginning of contraceptive practices
and of social forces on fertility. Then he
ignored his own precautions and attributed
40 per cent of the variance in fertility to
genetic effects. In computing this estimate,
he is assuming a social stability for three
generations that, in fact, did not exist. Because of this posited stability, Fisher is
able to claim a significant amount of
selection intensity since certain families
are assumed to contribute proportionately
more offspring to the next generation.

The estimate of genetic variance based
on the square of the mother-daughter correlation divided by the grandmother-granddaughter correlation was probably a fair
measure of both paternal and maternal
fertility since paternal grandmother’s fertilities were used. A case could be made
for computing the same estimate with our
data since a son’s fertility is influenced
by his mother’s fertility as well as his
paternal grandmother’s. If this estimate
is computed, the results suggest something
other than a significant genetic component
is determining fertility. Half of the covariance of Generation I with Generation
II is 0.404. If one uses Fisher’s third approach, one finds that the correlation is
negative, (0.036)?/ —0.090 = — 0.0144.
This result is clearly in marked contrast
to Fisher’s estimate of 0.40. Stability of
environment for three generations is a
precarious assumption.

It is also necessary to ascertain whether
our sample is representative of the British
peerage. Hollingsworth (1964) has published an historical analysis of the demography of the British peerage. He found
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

that the mean age of first marriage for
males fluctuated around 31.4 years, but
did not change significantly for cohorts
born from 1725 to 1875. The mean age of
marriage fluctuated between 28.2 and 30.5
years in our sample; analysis of variance
indicated that the mean age at first marriage did not change significantly.

Although the mean fertilities in our
sample are higher than Hollingsworth’s,
the trend in the change in fertility through
time in our sample mirrors that of Hollingsworth’s. The mean fertilities are expected to be higher in our sample since
there was selection for fertile marriages.
In Hollingsworth’s study, there was a decline in fertility from a mean of 5.0 offspring to a mean of 3.5 offspring from 1590
to 1740, respectively. After 1740, the decline ceased and the mean rose to almost
5.0 offspring again in cohorts born from
1700-24 and 1775-90. After 1815, family
size began a steady decline which has
persisted until the present time.

cohorts have been plotted in Figure 1.
The change in fertility through time clearly
is not linear. This fact leads to serious
questions as to the validity of the assumed linear model of regression analysis,
and ultimately invalidates the measurement of heritabilities. Although data on
females were unavailable for this study,
fertility trends were the same for females
as for males.

Students’ ¢-tests were computed on the
differences in mean fertilities between fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, and
grandmothers and granddaughters in Pearson’s data listed in Table 1. All means
between the three groups are different at
probabilities greater than 1,000 to 1. This
reconfirms our supposition that the observed secular trend in males was also occurring in females.

Other studies since Pearson’s have been
concerned with the correlation between
sibship size and progeny number. Huestis
and Maxwell (1932) published the results
of a questionnaire submitted to students

at the University of Oregon and computed
a correlation of 0.124 between sibship size
and progeny number. Bresard (1950)
found that sibship size seemed to be related to progeny number in working class
and farm families, groups in which there
was also more stability in occupation from
generation to generation. No correlations
were computed and the data presented
were insufficient for computing correlations.

Berent (1953) computed a correlation
of 0.187 from a sample of gynecological
patients in Great Britain. Kantner and
Potter found an insignificant correlation
(less than 0.10) using data from the Indianapolis study of couples of reproductive
age during 1927-40. In 1962, Beckman
and Elston computed a correlation in a
sample from Sweden. However, when they
corrected for the differences between ages
of the spouses, the association disappeared.
In other words, the secular change in fertility trends was evident even in the few
years difference between wives’ and husbands’ ages. Duncan and coworkers (1965)
found that when the duration of the marriage and wife’s education were held constant, the correlation -between sibship size
and progeny number became insignificant.
Imaizumi et al. (1970) found the correlation to be essentially zero in a Japanese
rural population.

Neel and Schull (1972) computed a
correlation of 0.09 for mothers-daughters
and 0.07 for fathers-sons from published
genealogies of Amish families. This group
with a high mean sibship size (9.74 for
females, 9.57 for males) places emphasis
on high fertility so it could be expected
that if there were a correlation and if it
were due to a heritable component, it
would exist in this group. Clearly, the
correlation in this group is essentially zero.

MacCluer et al, (1971) used demographic data from the Yanomamo as a

tion of primitive population structure. The
simulation results were inconsistent with
the observed consanguinity in the population when only obligatory cousin marriage was incorporated into the model.
However, when a correlation between fathers’ and sons’ fertilities was added to
the simulation model, the result matched
that observed in the population. She found
that males whose fathers were powerful
were more likely to obtain extra wives. By
changing the probabilities of polygynous
matings of these sons, the simulation produced a consanguinity structure which
matched that observed in the population.
The correlation between sibship size and
progeny numbers for fathers and sons was
0.258.

It is apparent from the re-examination
of Pearson’s data as well as from a review
of other studies on the correlation between
sibship size and progeny number that past
attempts to measure the heritable component in fertility are neither valid nor
reliable because of the overwhelming contribution of the social environment to
fertility in human populations. Since a
measurement of selection is differential
fertility, it may be futile to attempt a
measure of the heritability of the measure
of Darwinian fitness.

Concomitant with this philosophical
dilemma is the dilemma posed by man’s
social environment. For example, in a society such as the Amish where social values
contribute to an optimization of fertility,
there is no correlation between sibship size
and progeny number in females, and yet
in a group such as the Yanomano where
infanticide is practiced, there is a significant correlation between fathers and sons.
Enough studies have been done on groups
in industrialized societies to indicate that
the change in the social environment between generations is so great that differential fertility is not correlated to any specific

subgroup for a long enough period to have
any significant impact on the genetic
makeup of a particular population.

SUMMARY

A sample of the fertilities of fathers
and sons in the British peerage was drawn
in order to re-examine the correlation between sibship size and fertility first computed by Karl Pearson in 1899. The
correlation between grandmothers and
granddaughters in the British peerage was
used by R. A. Fisher to estimate the genetic

component of the variance in fertility.
With re-examination of the data it was
found that secular change, i.e., date of
Marriage, was contributing a significant
proportion of the correlations between sibship size and progeny number.
