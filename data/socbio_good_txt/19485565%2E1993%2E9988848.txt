Breastfeeding and Waiting Time
to Conception for Malay Women:
A Tale of Two Surveys

ABSTRACT: This study investigates the unusual relationship between breastfeeding and waiting
time to conception in Malaysia as reported in Goldman et al. (1987). Using data from the
Malaysian World Fertility Survey (MWFS), Goldman and her colleagues (1987) find that
noncontracepting Malaysian women have an unusually long waiting time to conception, given
their relatively short durations of breastfeeding. This study provides a similar analysis using data
from the Malaysian Family Life Survey (MFLS) and finds a more typical relationship. I conclude
that the distinction between full and partial breastfeeding made to respondents of the MFLS
probably led to more reliable responses to questions about breastfeeding duration, especially for

women who breastfeed for long durations.

Studies of birth interval length
abound in the demographic literature
for good reason (Goldman et al., 1987;
Palloni and Millman, 1986; Smith,
1985; Trussell et al., 1985; Knodel and
Lewis, 1984; Habicht et al., 1985; John
et al., 1988). The length of time between pregnancies influences not only
the potential growth rate of a population (Knodel, 1977; Bongaarts, 1982),
but has implications for child health as
well. Longer intervals imply increased
survival probabilities for children in
developing countries (Hobcraft et al.,
1985; Hobcraft, 1987), especially if the
longer intervals are associated with intensive breastfeeding practices.!

1Separating the advantages of breastfeeding for
child survival into spacing components and nutritive
components is very difficult. The advantages of long
subsequent birth intervals may be due largely to
breastfeeding per se (Retherford et al., 1989), i.e.,
its nutritive and anti-infective properties, while the
advantages of long previous birth intervals are probably the result of other factors, such as enabling better maternal recovery between births, and less competition among siblings (Pebley and Millman, 1986).

Breastfeeding is a primary determinant of the length of the birth interval
in many developing countries (Van
Ginneken, 1977; Jain and Bongaarts,
1981; Goldman et al., 1987; SimpsonHerbert and Huffman, 1981; Singh and
Ferry, 1984), especially if contraceptive use is uncommon. Breastfeeding
delays the return of ovulation and thus
the risk of a subsequent pregnancy for
a period of time that is proportional to
both the length and the intensity of
suckling (Jelliffe and Jelliffe, 1978).
The exact degree to which breastfeeding protects a woman from pregnancy,
however, is open to contention.* While
Habicht et al. (1985) find that a month
of full breastfeeding delays resumption

*A panel of experts participating in the 1988 Bellagio Consensus Conference on Lactational Infertility concluded that for amenorrheic women fully
breastfeeding, “breastfeeding provides more than
98% protection from pregnancy in the first six
months” (Kennedy et al., 1989). For a critical assessment of this consensus statement, see Trussell
and Santow, in press.

of ovulation by about a month, Jain
and Bongaarts (1981) report delays in
the resumption of menstruation? of
only about half that time. Indeed,
Knodel and Lewis (1984) find durations of postpartum amenorrhea quite
difficult to predict from breastfeeding
durations.

However, Goldman et al. (1987) in
a recent study of noncontracepting
women from twenty developing countries find a rather close association between median durations of breastfeeding and median waiting times to
conception.> (Fig. 1). While the overall
relationship is positive, monotonic,
and fairly linear, Malaysia is an obvious exception to this general pattern.
Median waiting time to conception in
Malaysia is 20.5 months for noncontracepting women who breastfeed. This
wait is almost 8 months longer than expected, given the short median duration of breastfeeding (5.9 months) in
the study population.® Further analysis
of the Malaysian data (from the
Malaysian World Fertility Survey
[MWFS]) by ethnic group show the
Malays to be the true outliers. Malay
waiting times are much longer than
predicted from their duration of
breastfeeding; Chinese women have

return at the same time.

‘Also, breastfeeding may provide some protection against pregnancy even after menses returns
(Hobcraft and Guz, 1985; John et al., 1987).

3““Waiting time to conception” is the interval between a birth and the onset of the next pregnancy
that results in a live birth.

Goldman et al. (1987) used the following equation to predict a country’s median waiting time to
conception from its median breastfeeding duration:
Median waiting time = (0.8 * median duration of
breastfeeding) + 7.9 mo.

waiting times that are fairly close to
their predicted value.’

This paper will first attempt to reproduce the measures of breastfeeding
duration and waiting time to conception for Malaysia as reported in the
Goldman et al. study, then compute
comparable measures using data from
a similar survey of Malaysian women
(the Malaysian Family Life Survey
[MFLS]), and finally, attempt to explain the anomalous case of Malaysia
in the relationship between these two
phenomena.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
MALAYSIA WORLD FERTILITY SURVEY

The MWFS was one of over forty
surveys conducted in developing countries during the 1970’s and early 1980’s
as part of the World Fertility Survey
(WFS) program. The MWES survey
collected information on contraceptive
use, reproductive histories, and breastfeeding behavior from 6,368 evermarried women age 49 or younger in
Peninsular Malaysia during August to
December 1974. The following breastfeeding information was collected for
the last two births (or the last birth, if
a woman only had one child): Did you
breastfeed (name)? (If yes) For how
many months did you breastfeed him/
her?

Goldman et al. (1987) calculated
waiting time to conception by subtracting 9 months from the interbirth interval; waiting time to a current pregnancy is imputed to be the length of

7Goldman et al. (1987) compute a “residual
waiting time” (compared with the predicted value)
by a method of median polish. The residual waiting
time is over 7 months for the Malays, but only 2
months for the Chinese.

time since the last birth, minus the estimated length of current gestation.
Only breastfeeding behavior and waiting time occurring within the two years
prior to the interview® to currently
married women not using contraception were included in the analysis.°

8The actual] window was 27 to 3 months prior to
the interview, so as to exclude recently pregnant
women who may not yet know of their pregnancy.

°This is because the WFS collected information
on breastfeeding for only the last two births. Unless
a time window is specified for a short enough period
of time that the vast majority of women could not
have had more than two births in the window, interval estimates would be biased. For example, if a
larger window (say, 5 years) had been used, the
shortest intervals (which resulted in a woman having
more than two births) would have been excluded
(John et al., 1988).

Median ‘waiting times and median
breastfeeding durations were calculated using increment/decrement lifetables. 1°

In an attempt to approximate Goldman et al.’s estimate for the median
duration of breastfeeding for the
MWES data, I employed decrement
calculations by restricting the life table
to intervals that began during the years

0Births occurring within the two-year window
contribute exposure beginning at duration zero.
Births occurring before the two-year window contribute exposure beginning at the duration at which
they enter the window. Open intervals were censored at the time of interview for the waiting time
measures; children currently breastfeeding were
censored at the time of interview for the breastfeeding duration measures.

1972-—74.1! Since this analysis provided
estimates quite close to those obtained
by Goldman et al. (Table 2), it was
deemed unnecessary to recreate the
more elaborate increment/decrement
procedure used in their study.

MALAYSIA FAMILY LIFE SURVEY

The MFLS was conducted by the
RAND Corporation between August
1976 and August 1977. Respondents
from 1,262 households were interviewed in Peninsular Malaysia, and
each of these households contained at
least one ever-married woman less
than 50 years of age. The MFLS collected similar types of information as
the MWES, but also included extensive
sections on economic activity, timeuse, migration, and community variables.

Regarding breastfeeding, the respondent answered the following questions for each birth:

Did you breastfeed (NAME OF CHILD)? I
want to know even if it was for a few
days.

How long did you breastfeed (CHILD)?
RECORD AMOUNT OF TIME; CODE TIME
UNIT.!2 (IF CURRENTLY BREASTFEEDING,
CODE “‘1”’)

Waiting times to conception are calculated by subtracting the duration of
pregnancy (asked of the respondent
but sometimes imputed) from the interbirth interval. Median waiting times

11A larger window (1971-74) was needed to obtain enough closed intervals to get a median for the
waiting time to conception.

12AlIso, the respondent was asked for the age at
which the child was first given supplemental food:
ASK ALL—At what age was (cHILD) first given any
type of food or drinks (including water) other than
breastmilk on a regular daily basis? To keep the
MELS analysis comparable to the MWFS analysis,
this information is not utilized at this stage of the
investigation.

and median breastfeeding durations
are calculated using lifetables. Only
births occurring between January 1972
and December 1974 are included in the
analysis. '3

RESULTS

Comparable measures of breastfeeding duration and waiting time to
conception using MFLS and MWFS
data are reported in Table 2.>This
comparison includes all women who
breastfeed but use no method of birth
limitation (except, perhaps, breastfeeding).14

Though the median waiting times to
conception are fairly close for the two
surveys, the median duration of breastfeeding in the MFLS is about double
that of the MWFS. This relationship
also holds for all breastfed births born
during the period 1972-74, 1.e., including intervals in which contraception
was used (Table 3). Tables 2 and 3 illustrate that if the median duration of
breastfeeding is computed for Malays
and Chinese separately, it is clear that
the discrepancy between the two surveys holds only for the Malay women.
This is consistent with Goldman et al.’s
conclusion that it is only the Malay

13The MFLS datafile used in this analysis was
created by RAND from the original MFLS data
type. In this file the record unit is a birth, instead of
a woman. Each record contains a variety of information about both the birth and the mother. To
check the comparability of this data set with other
MELS reports, percentages breastfeeding by parity
reported by DaVanzo and Butz 1982 are compared
in Table 1 with results obtained using the birth file.
The correspondence is quite close.

Though breastfeeding was not suggested as a
possible method of contraception in the MWFS, it
was in the MFLS. To make the samples comparable,
those women in the MFLS who said they used
breastfeeding to reduce the chance of becoming
pregnant are included in the analysis.

ferences in reported breastfeeding durations are illustrated by the breastfeeding survivorship curves shown in
Figure 2. While the Chinese curves
derived from the two surveys are
very close through the third quartile
(1, = 0.25), the Malay curves tell entirely different stories about breastfeeding during this time period.

DISCUSSION

The results elicit two questions: (1)
Why do the MWFS and the MFLS give
such different measures of breastfeeding duration for Malay women? (2)
Why does the MWES survey stand out
as an outlier from the other WFS surveys?!5 The answer to both questions
seems to involve a problem in the interpretation of the breastfeeding question by MWES respondents. While the
MELS explicitly asked about full and
partial breastfeeding, and several of
the other countries that conducted
WES surveys went to great lengths to
ensure that the woman understood that
the interviewers were interested in any
breastfeeding, the MWFS question is
quite ambiguous on this point. Women

1SThough both surveys suffer from a problem of
respondent heaping of breastfeeding durations at intervals of 6 months, this does not seem to account
for the differences in reported breastfeeding durations. The heaping index as defined by Ferry (1981)
(the sum of percentages of all births (breastfed or
not) weaned at durations 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, & 36 mo)
for weaned children born during the time period
1972-74 is 24.6% for the MFLS and 11.5% for the
MWFS, which is not surprising since the MWFS
births included in the analysis occurred closer to the
time of the survey. More recent MFLS births (1975~
77), however, have higher median durations of
breastfeeding than those born in 1972-74, and a
lower heaping index than even the MWFS sample
(4.0%), indicating that differential memory is unlikely to have been a major explanatory factor for
the differences in breastfeeding duration reports
from these two surveys.

interviewed in the MWFS were left to
resolve for themselves the question of
whether partial breastfeeding should
be included in their reports of “months
breastfeeding,” and the degree to
which a mix of feeding practices should
count.!© That is, some Malay women
may equate a change from full breastfeeding to partial breastfeeding as
weaning, and others may decide that a
child who receives “most’’ of his/her
diet from sources other than breastmilk has been effectively weaned.
This ambiguity may present less of a
problem for the Chinese respondents
since Chinese durations of any breastfeeding (as measured in the MFLS) are
much shorter than for the Malays. In
fact, reported breastfeeding durations
of women who wean early (by four
months for the Chinese and by two
months for the Malays) are quite similar for the two surveys. It is the longer
breastfeeders who appear to underrteport breastfeeding durations in the
MWKES. It seems that for breastfeeding
durations of more than a few months,
some periods of very limited breast
feeding may be excluded, unless spe
16Reinterpretation from the original Malay and
Chinese versions of the MWFS question on breastfeeding did not reveal any phrasing nuances that
might guide the woman on this point.

cifically asked for as in the MFLS. If
weaning is more often a distinct event
for Chinese infants than it is for Malay
infants, then the closer correspondence of the two survey curves for this
group makes sense, as there would be
less ambiguity about what “weaning”
means for Chinese respondents. A test
of this hypothesis would require more
detailed histories of the relative balance between breastmilk and supplemental feeding throughout the breast
feeding period.

If Malay women do, in fact, wean
their infants over an unusually long petiod of time, this would help explain
why the MWFS would give much lower
durations of breastfeeding than other
WFS countries that ask the breastfeeding question in a similar manner.!7 Alternatively, Malaysia may stand out as
an outlier from the other WFS countries that did not distinguish between
full and partial breastfeeding because
of the unpopularity (relative to other
WES countries) of breastfeeding there
during the early 1970’s.18 Women may
be more inclined to omit periods of
partial breastfeeding in response to
ambiguous queries about breastfeeding behavior in societies where breastfeeding is not especially popular, or

Ferry (1981) for one, views the reported
MWES breastfeeding duration measures with skepticism.

18Malaysia had the lowest proportion of infants
breastfed (74%) among the WFS surveys included
in Ferry’s (1981) analysis, and the median duration
of full breastfeeding in the MFLS sample is less than
one month, compared to mean durations of full
breastfeeding ranging from 2.2-7.9 months among
the WFS countries of Singh and Ferry’s (1984)
study. A difference between the MFLS and the
WFS surveys that distinguish between full and partial breastfeeding is that only the MFLS includes
water as a supplemental food. This may be partly
responsible for the very short durations of full
breastfeeding reported in the MFLS.

where extended periods of very limited
breastfeeding is the norm.

The anomalous case of Malaysia in
Goldman et al.’s (1987) study of the relationship between breastfeeding and
waiting time to conception seems to be
due to underreporting of breastfeeding
durations in the MWES. Substitution
of data from the MFLS from the same
time period brings Malaysia more in
line with the other countries of the
study. Using MFLS data in Goldman
et al.’s equation for predicting the
country’s median waiting time to conception from the median duration of
breastfeeding (given in Footnote 5)
gives a predicted value of 18, which is
only 3 months less than the observed
value of 21. Data from the MWEFS,
however, result in a discrepancy between the observed and expected values of 8 months.

The discrepancy in reported breastfeeding duration from these two surveys of the same country covering

tionnaire phrasing can have on reports
of respondent behavior. The more detailed approach of the MFLS resulted
in a two-fold increase in a summary
measure of breastfeeding duration.
Still, even the detail of the MFLS does
not provide sufficient information to
fully explain how breastfeeding behavior in Malaysia differed from other
WFS countries during the 1970’s. To
answer this question would require still
more information, such as a measure
of the relative balance between breastmilk and supplemental feeding among
infants partially breastfed and more
general research on the extent to which
perceived social approval might affect
individual reports of behavior.
