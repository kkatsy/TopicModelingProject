Potential Mates in a Small Human Population

The determinants and consequences of
mate choice in man have long occupied the
attention of both biological and sociological
investigators. For the geneticist, the primary concern has been to evaluate departures from the idealized panmictic model
upon which so much evolutionary theory
has been based. Such studies have been concerned principally with (1) the consequences
of assortative mating with respect to Mendelian inheritance (for example, Crow and
Felsenstein, 1968), and more substantively,
evaluations of the strength of correlation between mates with respect to physical traits
(Spuhler 1962, 1968), (2) effects on rates and
types of consanguinity brought about by
age and sex stratification within a population of finite size (see Barrai, Cavalli-Sforza,
and Moroni, 1962), and (3) estimates of the
effective size of population isolates or breeding “neighborhoods” (for a review, see Morton, 1969).

The social scientist, on the other hand,
has been seeking to define those social, cultural, and psychological processes which
govern mating behavior and make it predictable. Eckland (1968) has reviewed a
number of sociological theories of mate
choice. These theories include various at

tempts to explain mate choice on the basis
of such factors as psychological and personality trait correlations, group values, economic exchange, several aspects of social,
educational, and ethnic stratification, and
geographic propinquity. Restrictions on
mate choice may be inherent in the demography of a population, and some effort has
been made to evaluate the limits imposed
on mate choice by the age and sex structure
of a population (see, for example, Akers,
1967).

There is no doubt that many of the methods discussed by Eckland would be difficult
to apply to primitive populations. The majority of the sociological studies, as well as
the genetic, have been done on large national populations where the characteristics
of thousands of married couples may be investigated. Anthropologists, however, typically must deal with populations which
contain a few hundreds or thousands of individuals in foto, and where consequently
the number of married couples is so low as
to make impossible reliable evaluations of
all but the most widely distributed characteristics of those involved. In addition, personality traits affecting mate choice, if they
play any part at all in such groups, may be
difficult to assess by outsiders; bases for
stratification may be limited; and complex

rules of endogamy may make geographical
propinquity an exceedingly difficult concept
to apply. For all of these reasons, anthropologists have relied heavily upon interpretation of values, analysis of economic exchange (broadly defined), and to a very
large extent, upon explicit statements about
marriage rules and kinship terminology
from informants for elucidation of the social
and mating structure.

Primitive populations are of considerable
interest to geneticists because they supply
our best estimates of response to the conditions under which most of man’s evolution
has occurred (Neel, 1969). The fact that
they tend to be small is one of these conditions and has of itself effects on genetic,
demographic, and social structure. Aside
from the difficulties mentioned above which
are encountered when dealing with these
populations, small size does provide some
advantages. It is often possible to enumerate
and construct pedigrees for the entire population and to perform tests on all individuals rather than on a sample. Elucidation of
structure may further be enhanced if these
populations are isolated from genetic or
cultural mixing with others.

Quantitive methods for the analysis of
the structure of small populations are in
short supply. With respect to mate choice,
some of the standard population genetics
measures are applicable and others are being developed (MacCluer and Schull, 1970;
see also Ward and Neel, 1970). There are
also some notable exceptions to the nonquantitive approach taken by most anthropologists. These have involved the construction and analysis of genealogies by computer
(Coult and Randolph, 1965) and the prediction of specific types of consanguineous
mating in populations both real (Mark,
1967; Goldberg, 1968) and simulated (Kunstadter et al., 1963; Gilbert and Hammel,
1966).

This paper is intended as a step toward a
quantitative characterization of marriage

possibilities in a single small population.
One of the most important elements in population genetic theory is the concept of random mating. In a bisexual population this
implies in the strictest sense that any male
has an equal probability of mating with any
female in the population. It is obvious that
this is not the case in human populations.
Hajnal (1963) corrected for one important
deviation by defining random mating in
man as the state which exists if the chance
that two opposite-sexed individuals marry
depends only on the interval between their
dates of birth. Using this definition, he constructs a model which roughly predicts the
distribution of consanguineous marriage
types in several large populations in the
world. With small populations, however, the
number of individuals in any age class may
be so small and variable that the actual opportunities for mating into that class bear
little relationship to the probabilities predicted by models such as Hajnal’s.

Some form of long-term union of opposite-sexed pairs is typical of all human societies. Although the term “‘marriage” usually
implies a more formal and institutional definition than is necessary here, it will be used to
describe such unions. Marriage, then, represents a form of sampling without replacement from the pool of eligible mates which
is likely to further reduce the randomness
of mate choice among the unmarried. Also,
where numbers are critically low, members
of the nuclear family and other close relatives who are culturally proscribed as mates
may make up an inordinate proportion of
opposite-sexed individuals. The method
used here defines some of these restrictions
and shows their consequences on numbers,
age, and relationship of potential mates.
Implicit in the study is the assumption that
all individuals can be classified according to
their availability for marriage. The limits of
availability are determined by cultural rules
governing age and family relationship of
mates and by opportunities afforded by the

demographic structure of the population.
If these rules and the demographic structure
can be described, it is then possible to define
for each person an upper limit of oppositesexed individuals who are potential mates.

THE POPULATION

The Northside French of St. Thomas,
V.I., occupy two quarters (administrative
subdivisions) located on the central northern mountain slopes of the island. The community had its origins in the middle of the
nineteenth century as land parcels became
available to immigrants from the French
West Indies island of St. Barthélémy (St.
Bart). As in the districts on St. Bart where
they originated, the principal source of subsistence until recently has been farming,
augmented by occasional fishing (see Dyke,
1970; Morrill, 1967; Morrill and Dyke,
1966; Lasserre, 1961). Immigration began
gradually and reached its peak in the early
decades of the twentieth century; in 1966
only about 10% of the live population had
been born on St. Bart, most of these being
older people.

Although geographically scattered, the
Northside community is tightly organized
and until the recent growth of the tourist
industry in the Virgin Islands has been highly endogamous. Increasing integration of
the island into the mainland economy is
beginning to break down traditional values,
as might be expected; but despite an increased tendency for young people to move
out of the community, few outsiders marry
in. Northsiders are Roman Catholic and
abide quite strictly by church sanctions regarding baptism, and to a lesser extent by
those regarding marriage, for there are a few
consensual unions. These appear to be nearly as stable as legitimate marriage, however,
and divorce is rare, [legitimate births occur
infrequently, and in most cases it has been
possible to establish paternity with some
degree of confidence.

Vital information for this population is

available from several sources. Parish records provided rather detailed information
on birth and marriages, and on family relationships. Government vital statistics
records proved more useful for information
on deaths and served as a check on parish
records, as did information on property inheritance taken from land transfer records.
A household census made by Morrill in 1962
served as a preliminary guide to family reJationships. A total of 1,219 individuals
born between 1816 and 1966 was ascertained
from these sources, of which 661 (347 males
and 314 females) were alive in 1966. For
purposes of this study, 437 males and 391
females born between 1890 and 1966 were
selected. This included all those born on St.
Thomas, unmarried immigrants from St.
Bart, and 13 non-French females who married into the community between 1908 and
1966.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data collected for each individual
consisted of sex, name, date of birth, date
of death, father, mother, spouse, and date of
marriage. These were coded and placed on
a punched data card. A computer program
was written which sorted on the basis of
parental identification-code numbers so that
ancestral lines could be established. A printout was made for each sibship in such a way
that sibs were grouped in order of birth,
followed by all ancestors in order of relationship from parents to great-great-grandparents. This listing made possible relatively
quick checking of accuracy and determination of linkages of pedigrees. In addition to
the listing, a single punch card was prepared
automatically for each individual by means
of the same basic sorting instructions given
the computer. This card contained coded
information for sex, ego’s birth, death, and
marriage dates, and identification number
for ego and all his ancestors through greatgrandparents. |

Another computer program was written
Vol. 18, No. 1

which, using information from the latter
card, tabulated for each individual all those
of the opposite sex who met specified age,
family relationship, and marital status requirements. Various classes of these individuals were grouped and their characteristics
averaged.

RESULTS
NUMBERS OF POTENTIAL MATES

The sample described above consists of
_, all individuals who became available for
=> Marriage at any time between the years 1908
‘and 1966. Simple comparison of the total
numbers of the sexes without taking into
2% account demographic restrictions and culG tural factors which influence marriage does
2 not give a reasonable estimate of the actual
ot numbers of marriageable persons available
co to individuals at a given point in time, or at
a given age. A general procedure was fol'g lowed which found the total number of egos
2 (N;) in each of 7 classes of mating eligibility,
.2 summed the total numbers of opposite-sexed
= individuals (M;;) appropriate to each ego j,
¢ and divided this sum by the number of egos
‘> in each eligibility class:

ya,/ N;.

This mean was calculated by age of ego and
by calendar year, using increasingly restrictive criteria of mating eligibility as follows:
1. Mean numbers of opposite-sexed inA dividuals without regard to age or family relationship who (a) were alive when ego was
at a given age and (b) were alive during any
calendar year were determined. As examples of these calculations, (a) any male born
since 1890 and surviving to age 25 would
find at that age a mean of 213.15 females of
all ages in the sample, and (6) for males
alive in 1966, there were 339 live females.
2. If all of ego’s opposite-sexed sibs and
lineal relatives (parents, children, grandparents and grandchildren, great-grandparents and great-grandchildren) were re
ownloaded by [Univer

moved, the mean numbers were reduced.
The examples given in the previous class
become (a) 210.08 females for 25-year-old
males, and (6) 334.37 females for males alive
in 1966.

3. Individuals not of mating age were
next eliminated. From the distribution of
143 first marriages where the ages of the
couple were known, it was noted that males
married only between the ages of 18 and 45.
For females, the comparable ages were 15
and 40, These ages correspond approximately to the reproductive period for women and
to the age of greatest economic productivity
for men. Using them as limits of mating age,
calculations were again made by age of ego
and by calendar year. The figures used as
examples in the previous class become reduced to (a) 93.55 females for 25-year-old
males and (0) 141.85 females for males of
mating age in 1966.

4, Opposite-sexed individuals falling outside age-differential limits were next eliminated. From the distribution of ages at
marriage it was observed that the husband
was in all but a very few cases from 5 years
younger to 20 years older than his wife
(abbreviated here as-—-5 to +20). These

figures were used as the limits of age dif
ferential for inclusion of an individual as a
potential mate, with the result that mean
numbers were further reduced. The examples from the previous class become (a) for
25-year-old males, 67.57 females who meet
these age specifications, and (b) 106.99 females for mating-age males in 1966.

5. Since in a monogamous population individuals who have already married are no
longer available for further marriage, calculations of mean numbers were made on
the basis of single persons only. With this
additional restriction, (a) single 25-year-old
males had available 43.06 single females,

_and (6) single males of mating age in 1966

had 51.44 single females available to them.

excluded from all but Curve I. The histograms at the bottom of Figures 1¢ and 1b
represent the observed distribution of age at
first marriage for males and females respectively. Curve Vrepresents a mean upper limit
of numbers of potential mates. The location
of the mode at age 35 for male, and age 23
for female egos is a function of the age-differential limits, i.e.,age 35 is the last year for
males that numbers of potential mates can
be increased by newly available 15-year-old
females if males may be no more than 20
years older than their mates. Comparison of
curve V with the two respective histograms
indicates that maximum numbers of potential matescalculated in this way byage of ego
has little influence on the number of marriages contracted at that age. Arrows above
the curves in Figure la correspond to the
values given as examples in the text above.

In Figure 2, Curves I, II, and IV reflect
the overall growth of the population from
1908 to 1966. It is interesting that the rate
of removal of individuals from their respective mating pools by reason of marriage has
tended to keep the size of the pools relatively constant for several decades at a time.
The only period of appreciable increase of
potential mates (Curve V) occurred approximately during the decade 1940-49 when
the mean number of marriages per year fell
from 2.20 to 1.70. Since 1950 the marriage
rate has been 4.23 marriages per year.

The mean number of males exceeds that
of females in all years regardless of the restrictions imposed on inclusion. The sex ratio (100 X M/F) for individuals of all ages
over all years is 114.83. If all age and agedifferential restrictions are met, the ratio
becomes 116.90, and when married individuals are excluded from the calculations it
rises to 139.76. This last increase is the
consequence of removing equal numbers
(through marriage) from already unequal
pools.

Goldberg (1967) has calculated the size

Potential Mates

 

33

of the female potential mate pool for an
endogamous community of North African
immigrants to Israel. This population is
not exactly comparable to Northside in that
the number of adults appears to be somewhat smaller (the total population in 1950
was 400, as compared to 490), and in that
males average 1.16 years older than their
wives, as compared to 4.99, Also, in the Israeli population, young women are not eligible to marry until their older sisters have
done so, and Goldberg set the limits of the
age-differential of potential mates at one
standard deviation about the mean age difference at marriage, rather than at the extremes of the latter distribution. He finds
that males have on the average 28.7 available females before the elimination of married individuals. It is not possible to get
numbers of single females from the published results of Goldberg’s study since these
are presented only as percentages of those
meeting all age requirements; but since
these percentages range from less than 10%
to over 90%, the range of numbers is probably between 4 or 5 and 30.

Using all the criteria of eligibility described previously, the mean number of females for the average male over all years in
the Northside mate pool is 70.97 before, and
40.79 after, eliminating married individuals;
if, as in Goldberg’s study, the age differential is set at one standard deviation about
the mean age at marriage (husbands 5 = 6
years older than their wives, or —1 to
+11), these figures become 44.05 and 27.20
respectively.

One other estimate of numbers of potential mates in populations of less than a thousand was published by Dudley and Allen
(1942) wherein a number of older people in
two relatively endogamous communities in
North Carolina were asked how many young
people of the opposite sex they had known
well enough to pick a husband or wife from.
The answer is given as ‘‘around a dozen or

so, with the maximum set at two or three
dozen.”
AGE OF POTENTIAL MATES

Figure 3a shows the distribution of mean
and variance in age of single-female potential mates by age of males. The points plotted represent the observed mean age of wife
by age of husband. Since the age limits of
potential mates were deliberately set identically to the limits of age at marriage, it is
not surprising that the two distributions
correspond in some respects, but the mean
age of potential mates and mean age at marTiage are remarkably close. Unfortunately,
there are so few marriages that numbers of
spouses in each age class are too small for
meaningful statistical testing; but it appears
that mean age of potential mates may predict age of spouse fairly well. Figure 36
shows the distribution of age of male potential mates and husbands, by age of females.

FAMILY RELATIONSHIP AND CONSANGUINITY

Table 1 shows mean numbers of females
per male by family relationship averaged
over all years. First cousins have been broken down into the four types (FBD = fa
Social Biology

ther’s brother’s daughter, etc.), whereas
grandparent-child and great-grandparent—
child relationships, first cousin once removed (iCiR) types, and second-cousin
types have been pooled. The excess of parallel cousins (FBD and MSD) which is evident even when age and age-differential are
disregarded appears to be chiefly the result
of correlation of sex of immigrants. For example, there was a tendency for males from
St. Bart to join their brothers in Northside
whether or not the latter were married,
while females usually immigrated when
they could join a married sister. There is
some suggestion of the same pattern holding today with regard to visiting between
islands. The excess is maintained even after
those not of mating age, those outside the
age-differential (—5 to +20), and the mar
_ried have been eliminated. Mean numbers of

males available to females are slightly higher, but follow the same pattern as Table 1.

Table 2 shows proportions of the total
number of opposite-sexed individuals accounted for by each of the relationships
given. As might be expected, proportions of
relatives of the same generation (sibs, first

and second cousins) increase as restrictions
which limit age and age-differential are applied, while proportions decrease for crossgenerational relationships. The greatest increase in total proportion of potential mates
who are related to ego comes when calculations are made on the basis of single persons
only. This is to be expected if those who
marry are less closely related to each other
than are those who are left single. Proportions are little changed with reduction of
age-differential limits (~—1 to +11).

A convenient measure of relatedness is
the coefficient of kinship, which is the probability that alleles of a given locus drawn at
random from any two individuals in a population are identical by descent. The inbreeding coefficient is a special case of the
coefficient of kinship, the two individuals
drawn being limited to parents of ego. The

mean coefficient of kinship ( ¢ ), based here
on primary relationships, has been calculated by year and by age for potential mates
of those who have married within the community (termed here “endogamous” individuals) and for potential mates of those who
have not (termed “nonendogamous”). The
latter group includes both those who remain
in the community and those who emigrate
or marry exogamously. In this case married egos were not eliminated after the year
of their marriage as was the practice in
previous calculations; criteria for inclusion
of opposite-sexed individuals as potential
mates were unchanged, however.

Figures 4 and 5 show the mean coefhcient of kinship, excluding sibs and lineal
relatives, plotted for both groups of male
egos and their female potential mates, by

nonendogamous male egos are more closely
related to their potential mates than are the
endogamous males, This effect is less pronounced previous to the late 1920’s when
the proportion of immigrants among adults
was higher, and it tapers off after 1950 as
the nonendogamous group includes a decreasing proportion of men who have actually reached the end of the mating period.
The effect is similar, although not so pronounced, when calculations are made between female egos and their male potential
mates.

DISCUSSION

From Figures 1 and 2 it can be seen that
pools of opposite-sexed individuals are reduced in size by approximately one-half as
each increasing restriction is placed on eligibility for inclusion. This indicates the
necessity for avoiding a simple demographic
definition of availability for mating in small
populations. Comparisons of total numbers
of the sexes or even of numbers within
absolute mating age categories do not give
realistic estimates of those actually marriageable. Consideration must be given
to relative age and to previous marital status of those whose ages are appropriate for
marriage. The method used here has the
advantage of being objective and easily applied; it is very likely, however, that the
members of the population have additional
criteria of eligibility which further reduce
the maximum numbers shown here. Nonetheless, it appears that many more endogamous marriages might have been contracted than actually have been and that because of the excess of males no female has
lacked the opportunity to marry within the
community.

It is interesting that estimates of mean
numbers of female potential mates for
Northside, the Israeli population, and the
two North Carolina communities are roughly comparable. It would be useful to have
standardized estimates for other small popu

lations in order to understand the relationship between total population size and
numbers of potential mates. Livi (1949)
made a number of observations on small isolated populations whose demographic history has been recorded, and he found that
those which are of 300-500 individuals may
not be self-sustaining and have a high probability of dying out. Analysis of potential
mate pools should make it possible to evaluate the demographic and cultural determinants of the extinction process in such
populations. The relationships between total population size, potential mate pools,
and the geneticist’s effective population
size would also be interesting to know. It
will be necessary to analyze populations
where larger numbers of marriages are available in order to evaluate the effects of potential-mate age distributions on the distributions of marriage age.

There are only 18 marriages of persons
who are known to be related as second cousins or closer in the Northside population,
and thus it is not possible to test adequately
the influence of proportions of related potential-mate types on proportion of consanguineous marriage types. It is possible, however, to learn about marriage patterns with
respect to consanguinity if all family relationships of potential mates are taken together. As has been pointed out, the increase
in total proportion of potential mates who
are related to ego which occurs when married persons are excluded from the calculations (Table 2) implies that those who
marry endogamously are more distantly
related than those who do not. That this is
true can be seen from Table 3, where the
mean coefficient of kinship, excluding sibs
and lineal relatives, has been calculated
over all years for the four combinations of
endogamous and nonendogamous male egos
and their respective endogamous and nonendogamous female potential mates.

percentage of potential mates in each class

who are related as second cousins or closer.
All calculations have been made on the basis
of primary relationships since these are more
likely to be of sociological importance than
more distant secondary ones. From Table 3
it appears that endogamous males and females are least closely related and nonendogamous males and females are most
closely related. It also appears that consanguineous mating is avoided within the
former class, since the coefficient of kinship
of the 143 married men and their wives is
less than that for all married men and women taken together (0.004916 or 13% consanguineous marriages). Figures 4 and 5
show much the same thing in greater detail.
However, no attempt has been made to
separate the endogamous from the nonendogamous female potential mates with
the result that the two sets of curves compare relationships of the two groups of men
and approximately the same group of wommen. It looks very much as though the number of relatives a young person sees among
his potential mates has an effect on his remaining in the population. This is likely to
have important social and genetic effects on
the internal structure of the population and
on rates of migration and gene flow.

SUMMARY

A method of analysis is described and applied to a small population, by which potential mates are enumerated by age, calen

dar year, family relationship, and marital
status. When the most restrictive criteria
for inclusion in the potential mate pool are
applied, i.e., individuals fall within appropriate age and age-differential limits and are
not members of ego’s nuclear family, it appears that in this population (2) mean age
at marriage is not affected by mean numbers
of potential mates, but may be a function of
their mean age; (b ) neither numbers or sex
ratio of potential mate pools are accurately
reflected in the total population structure;
(c) mean numbers are relatively consistent
with estimates of numbers in at least two
other small populations; and (d) both males
and females who marry endogamously are
less closely related to their potential mates
than those who do not.

This method should be of considerable
utility as further populations are examined
for which the necessary pedigree information is available. Many of the questions
about minimum population size, extinction,
and effective population sizecan be answered
with the use of simulated populations. This
work is currently under way, as is the
analysis of the larger St. Bart population.
