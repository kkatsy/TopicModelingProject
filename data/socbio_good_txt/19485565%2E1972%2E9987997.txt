Inbreeding in the Kota of Nilgiri Hills, Madras

Nilgiris, or Nilagiris, which means “Blue
< Mountains,” is the smallest district of the
<* state of Madras in India, covering an area
"_ of 984 square miles. This district is mainly
3

populated by some Hindu castes and four
éotribes, namely the Badaga, the Toda, the
‘5 Kurumba, and the Kota, An ethno-bioS logical survey of the Kota was begun in
‘6 1966 and has continued until the present.
£Some of the results obtained in the course
5 of this study have already been published
‘<= (Ghosh, 1970; Basu and Ghosh, 1968). In
> this communication, the data on inbreeding
are given. A detailed report of this study
® will be presented in a subsequent paper.

S Among the four major tribes of this
€ district, the Kota belong to the lowest social
A stratum (Francis, 1908). It seems that the

Kota comprise a biologically isolated community, and this biological isolation has
been caused in good part by their social
relations with other Nilgiri tribes.

The Kota are a small population with
a total of 1,203 individuals divided among
seven villages, namely Aggal, Kil-Kotagiri,
Trichigadi, Kollimalai, Kundah, Sholur, and
Gudalur. Each village is divided at least into
three exogamous eris. No one is allowed
to take his or her mate from the village
keri to which he or she belongs; but one is

d

allowed to marry someone from the same
keri of another village.

The purpose of the present communication is to ascertain the frequencies of
various types of consanguineous matings
and thereby the inbreeding coefficients and
its effect on the fertility of the population.
The data on consanguineous matings among
the Kota have been collected from the
entire population.

In Table 1 the frequencies of the different
types of consanguineous matings are given.
Out of total number of 449 marriages (unpublished demographic data of the author)
57 or 12.69% were consanguineous. Of these
57 marriages, 43.86% were with full first
cousins, and 19.30% were with full second
cousins.

Out of 57 consanguineous marriages, 17
or 29.82% were childless matings, but all
the wives had not yet finished their reproductive span. It is, therefore, a rough
estimate of sterility among the inbred
couples.

The inbreeding coefficients have been
calculated directly from the pedigrees by
the path-coefficient method. In calculating
inbreeding coefficients, only the closest relationship between spouses has been taken
into consideration with a view to simplify

ing the mathematical calculations. This
method, first proposed by Wright (1922),
has also been followed by Salzano (1961),
Bonné (1963), and others, whereas Spuhler
and Kluckhohn (1953), Sutter and Tabah
(1956), and others have considered all the
possible relationships between the spouses
to ascertain inbreeding coefficients. The inbreeding coefficients vary between 0.0010
and 0.1250 for the Kota, the average being
0.04207.

DISCUSSION

The frequency of consanguineous marriages among the Kota is 12.69%, which
is fairly high, like the 14% frequency found
among the Caingang Indians (Salzano,
1961) and the Samaritans (Bonné, 1963).
The frequency of such marriages is not as
high among the whites of Lorient and
Gustavia parishes of the St. Barthelemy
Islands (Benoist, 1964). In comparison
also with the white populations (inbreeding
frequency, 2.4%) of the State of Rio
Grande do Sul (Freire-Maia, 1957), the
frequency of inbreeding among the Kota
is quite high,

Marriage between consanguineous rela
tives is highly favored by the various
religious isolates of Andhra Pradesh (Dronamraju, 1967; Dronamraju and Meera
Khan, 1963; Sanghvi, 1966). The practice
of inbreeding among the different religious
groups in Bombay has also been reported
by Sanghvi, Verde, and Master (1956). A
few cases of inbreeding have also been reported among the Kayastha (a Hindu
caste) of Bengal and the Baiga (a tribal
population) of Madhya Pradesh (Sarkar,
1967). Compared with the various populations of Southern India, the frequency of
cousin marriage among the Kota is not
very high.

Aberle et al. (1963) and Ember (1962)
assume that societies which practice inbreeding may be selected out, if the death
rate due to inbreeding is high. Livingstone
(1964) writes that consanguineous marriages within a single society have a higher
death rate among their offspring. It has
been found among the Kota that the average number of surviving offspring per
married woman (1.95) in consanguineous
marriages is slightly lower than that found in
the total population (2.03) (unpublished
demographic data). The present findings

apparently agree with Livingstone’s assumption, but more data are required to
assess the effect of inbreeding on the fertility of a population.

The coefficient of inbreeding (0.04207)
among the Kota is almost equal to the
highest recorded inbreeding coefficient
(0.043448) of the Samaritans (Bonné,
1963). It may well be assumed that this
inbreeding coefficient should still be regarded only the minimum for the same
reasons as pointed out for the Samaritan
population by Bonné (1963). Ishikuni et al.
(1960) have reported that the inbreeding
coefficient for Hosojima Island is 0.03341.
Compared to the Kota population, the inbreeding coefficients of the other populations in India, which show higher
frequencies of consanguineous marriages,
are considerably lower (Dronamraju and
Khan, 1963).

It is generally assumed that the smaller
the population size, the higher is the frequency of consanguineous marriages. The
population size of any Hindu caste in
Andhra Pradesh is several times bigger
than that of the Kota and the rate of consanguineous marriages in any Hindu caste
is much higher than that in the Kota population. As such, it is not the size of the
population which is responsible for higher
frequency of consanguineous marriages, but
cultural and social factors are also involved
as pointed out by Salzano (1962).
