ABSTRACT: Selection intensity, as indicated by total pre-reproductive mortality and fertility
(Crow, 1958), was computed among three Indian tribal populations living in similar geographical
environments—the Kolams, Raj Gonds, and Pardhans of Adilabad District, Andhra Pradesh.
The Pardhans showed the greatest selection intensity, (1.1811) followed by the Kolams (0.8564)
and Raj Gonds (0.7240). Pre-reproductive mortality and infertility contributed equally to selection

intensity in these tribal groups.

The district of Adilabad, with its considerable forest area, is inhabited by a
large number of tribal populations.
Situated between 77°46’ and 80° east longitude and 18°41’ and 19°56’ north
latitude in Andhra Pradesh, India, the district covers an area of 1,633 square
kilometers with a population density of
eighty individuals per square kilometer.
Some fifteen hundred feet above sea level,
it averages forty inches of annual rainfall.

About 13 per cent of the district population consists of tribal populations, of
whom the Gonds and Naikpods (69.4 per
cent), Kolams (15.6 per cent), Pardhans
(6.7 per cent), Koyas (6.0 per cent), and
Andhs (1.4 per cent) are the major tribes.
A majority of the Gonds and a few of the
other tribes have become settled agriculturists. However, some Kolams and
other small tribes still practice shifting cultivation without having permanent settlements. Their main crops are jowar,
pulses, and cotton.

These tribes also participate in plantation work and bamboo cutting in the dense
forest areas of Utnur, Sirpur, Asifabad,

and Boath taluks (subdivisions of the district). Malaria is endemic in these taluks,
and a considerable number of cases of
tuberculosis, influenza, and typhoid are
also reported at the primary health centers
in the district. Von Furer-Haimendorf
(1949) wrote that Utnur taluk was the
death trap of Hyderabad because of the
incidence of malaria. The tribes are highly
conservative in their attitude toward
modern medicine.

By culture and tradition they tend to
have large families, and the impact of the
district’s family planning program seems
to be insignificant. We have noticed that a
few of the males, attracted by monetary
incentives, go in to government clinics for
sterilization when they are in severe financial difficulties. We have also noticed that
in some tribes, like the Kolams, such
males keep the sterilization a secret to
avoid the risk of divorce.

Since poor nutrition, high disease incidence, and large family size permit the
forces of natural selection to operate in an
unmitigated manner, it would be interesting to study the intensity of such natural

selection acting on these tribes. Crow
(1958) suggested one possibility for
measuring intensities of natural selection
and derived a total index of opportunity
for natural selection. This index takes into
account the variation in mortality and fertility of the different individuals in a population.

In this paper, we have made an attempt
to obtain estimates of the total index for
selection among the Kolams, Raj Gonds,
and Pardhan tribes of Adilabad District.
The major emphasis has been on the
Kolams, who are divided into two subgroups, namely the Hill Kolams and the
Manne Kolams. The Hill Kolams commonly speak Kolami and Gondi, while the
Manne: Kolams speak Telugu. These two
groups are largely endogamous. The Hill
Komans live mostly in the Utnur,
Adilabad, and Asifabad taluks while the
Manne Kolams live mostly in the Sirpur
and Asifabad taluks. Intermarriage between the groups is rare. Some ethnographic material on these tribes is available
in Von Furer-Haimendorff (1949).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Reproductive histories were obtained as
part of the data on the pedigrees drawn for
studying consanguinity and inbreeding in
the tribes. The study was mainly directed
toward the Kolams whose two subgroups
live in different taluks of the district.
Comparative data were also collected simultaneously on the Gonds and Pardhans.
The field studies were made from November, 1975, to July 1977. The total number
of marriages studied for consanguinity in
these three tribes was 1,780 (Kolams,
1,324; Gonds, 300; and Pardhans, 156).
Only reproductive histories of living
women who had completed their reproductive period and were over 45 years at the
time of collection were utilized for the
purpose of computing the indices.

The indices for selection intensity were

computed following Crow (1958) and the
modified formula given by Johnston and
Kensinger (1971). The two indices are

feo =Im + 1,/P,,
and
Im =Ime +I me/Py + 14/Py + Ps

where I - = Crow’s index of natural selection, taking into account only live births,
and I ,, = a modified index of natural selection, taking into account all pregnancies.

I me = Peq/P, = prenatal mortality.

P .4 = proportion of prenatal deaths; P, =
1 — P eg.

Pm =P4a/P,; = total mortality.

P,=proportion of pre-reproductive
deaths among live-born; P, = 1 —
P q.

Ime = Pa/P; = proportion of childhood
mortality; P; = 1 — Py.

Is = V 2/8"
X =mean number of pregnancies or
live-born.

V, = variance of X.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The average number of live births and
the total index for selection, with its mortality and fertility components based on
the method of Crow (1958), are presented
in Table 1. The highest index of selection
was found among the Pardhans (1.1859),
followed by those for the Kolams (0.8702)
and Raj Gonds (0.7240). It can be noted
that higher selection intensities are associated with higher mean live births and a
higher mortality component in the selection index. Of the two subgroups of
Kolams, the Manne Kolam group has a
higher index of selection intensity even
though the mean live births in the two
subgroups are similar.

Excepting in the case of the Pardhans,
the relative contribution of the mortality

and fertility components to the total selection intensity are more or less equal in all
the tribal groups. In the case of the Pardhans, the high mortality component
(67.68 per cent) and the corresponding low
fertility differential could be due to the
small sample size. Among the Pahira
group of eastern India (Basu, 1969), the
relative contribution of infertility to the
total selection index is low, ranging from
28 to 30 per cent. Among the southern
Indian tribes, the Kotas of Nilagiri show
the highest index of selection (1.62) ever
reported from Indian tribes (Basu, 1972).
There, as in the present study, the mortality and fertility components make equal
contributions.

Studies among Indian tribes indicate
that pre-reproductive mortality contributes heavily to the process of natural selection, whereas in the population of
industrially developed countries prereproductive mortality is extremely low
(Spuhler, 1962; Cavalli-Sforza and

I Im I,/P. % of I,/Ps

Bodmer, 1971). While the extent of prereproductive mortality associated with
nongenetic causes is not known, it can be
presumed that endemic diseases such as
malaria, smallpox, cholera, and gastrointestinal parasites which are characteristic
of the forest habitat are responsible for the
higher incidence of pre-reproductive mortality. The differences in the relative contribution of the fertility component to the
total index of selection may also indicate
the influence of culture, behavior, heritability of fertility, and other environmental
factors on the fitness of the population.
These studies also suggest that in the long
run, when pre-reproductive mortality is
brought to a minimum, the fertility differential might become a main factor in the
operation of natural selection even among
tribal populations.

The total selection intensity and its
components, along with fecundity computed by the modified method (Johnston
and Kensinger, 1971), are given in Table

2. The data also show the same trends as
those computed on the basis of Crow’s
original method. The contribution of
prenatal mortality to the total index of
selection ranges from zero to 1.5 per cent.
In a Muslim population of West Bengal it
was around 5 per cent (Barua, 1976). The
generally low values of prenatal mortality
in our data may not indicate real values
among the present tribal groups because
the informants generally could not accurately recollect all prenatal losses and also

were hesitant and less serious about giving
this information. The Gonds were especially conservative in this respect.
