Childlessness Among American Women

 

Department of Sociology,
Brigham Young University,
Provo, Utah

ABSTRACT: The rate of childlessness in the United States has increased over the last two
decades. Changing or differential rates by different segments of society have important
implications for society. Most previous studies have relied on unrepresentative opportunistic
samples to identify those segments of society with lower or higher rates of childlessness. These
types of samples may misestimate both the number of women planning to remain childless and
the magnitude of the correlates of childlessness. The present study uses these previous studies to
identify predictor variables, but tests their significance using a recent national representative
sample of women in the United States, aged 20—44: Cycle III of the National Survey for Family
Growth, collected in 1982. The most important demographic factors are marital status and
fecundity status, followed by age, race or ethnicity, education of the respondent, labor force
status, and region. Father’s education and mother’s education are slightly, but not
significantly, related to childlessness. Contrary to findings from less representative samples,

urban-rural differences and religion are not related to childlessness.

Norms pertaining to family structure
in the United States have changed, making childlessness, and particularly voluntary childlessness, a more accepted
and desired lifestyle (Poston and Gotard, 1977; Poston and Kramer, 1983).
Childlessness has far-reaching consequences in family life and society.
Should it be adopted by a large segment
of the population, it could mean a decrease in population, particularly for
ethnic or religious groups which do not
foster the norm of having children.
Childlessness could complicate a potentially top-heavy population of elderly in
our society and thus worsen individual
problems associated with the aged
(Bachrach, 1980). In the long term, differential rates of childlessness also has
implications for the decline and possible
disappearance of some segments of society (Houseknecht, 1978; Veevers,
1973).

Effective birth control technology
has made the conscious decision to remain childless easier for women
(Veevers, 1973), allowing them to combine or exclude marriage, children, and
career, with little interference in their
sex lives. For the first time, with the possible exception of the Depression of the
1930’s when childlessness became a
strategy for economic survival, voluntary childlessness is a viable lifestyle
choice (Bloom and Bennett, 1986).

Changes in the normative and socialstructural aspects of our society also foster an environment favoring childlessness. Factors such as work histories,
parental attitudes, support for other
nonparents, and participation in the labor force have become important (Ory,
1978). Perhaps, the most significant
changes have come in the form of changing gender roles. With the women’s
movement of the 1960’s and 1970’s came

a different perception of what was expected of women, and what women expected of themselves. Women now look
to less traditional role models, including
their mothers who have made progress
in less traditional pursuits (Ory, 1978;
Corder and Stephan, 1984).

Women have made substantial gains
in education, employment, and the pursuit of careers outside of the home. The
number of women who completed college rose from 341,000 in 1970 to
480,000 by 1982. Women have also
made significant gains in the labor force,
comprising 42.6 per cent of the work
force in 1980, up from 29 per cent in
1950. In 1950, 33.9 per cent of women of
working age were in the labor force,

compared to 51.6 per cent in 1980. The }
number of women in managerial and 4

professional positions nearly doubled
from 1970 to 1980, and the segregation
of women in some occupations has declined (Bureau of the Census, 1984;
Waite, 1981).

Increased educational and employment opportunities have given many
women a different perspective on what
they can and should do with their lives.
American society is well-acquainted
with the “working mother,” but less familiar with those women (particularly
married women) who abandon the traditional value of having children in favor
of pursuing other interests.

In this paper we identify those demographic factors that influence the decision to remain childless. Several previous studies have done this (for
example, Gustavus, and Henley, 1971;
Houseknecht, 1978, 1979; Ory, 1978;
Silka and Kiesler, 1977; Veevers, 1973,
1980, 1982), but the present study differs in several important ways. First,
most earlier authors relied on small, opportunistic, and unrepresentative sam

ples. Some samples were obtained
through advertisements where selfselection is an obvious problem. Others
used networks of nonparents or organizational lists (such as the National Organization for Nonparents, National Alliance for Optional Parenthood, or
hospital or clinic lists) to obtain samples.
Respondents in many of these samples
were asked retrospective questions. The
responses and the samples do not represent all childless women. We use these
earlier studies for suggestive predictors
of the decision to remain childless, but
test these as hypotheses using a large
representative national sample of
women. We also rely on the recent excellent and comprehensive review by
Houseknecht (1987).

Studies using national samples have
been conducted primarily by Dudley
Poston. For example, Poston and Gotard (1977) used census data to examine
trends in childlessness from 1910 to
1975. Poston and Kramer (1983) examined Catholic and non-Catholic differences in childlessness using a national
sample. These two studies are fairly narrow, however, and do not examine correlates of childlessness. In two other articles, Poston examined correlates
(Poston, 1976; Poston and Kramer,
1983). Both articles, however, are written using data collected in 1973 or before. Mosher and Bachrach (1982) also
used national samples, Cycle I and Cycle II data from the National Survey of
Family Growth (NSFG), but these data
were collected in 1973-74 and 1976. We
use Cycle III data from the NSFG collected in 1982. Thus, a second way in
which the present study differs from others is the recency of the data.

A third way in which the present
study differs from earlier studies is the
use of multivariate statistics. Previous

bearing. Rearing children becomes a deterrent to reaching career or financial
goals. The opportunity cost of children
increases with education. DeJong and
Sell (1977) noted that educational attainment, student enrollment, and
labor-force participation all affected the
decision to remain childless. Ritchey
and Stokes found labor-force participation related to childlessness, but found
education to be related only for those
under the age of 30. Poston (1976)

A large difference between rural and
urban areas was noted by DeJong et al.
(1984). They found that rural women
generally expected to have children and
were socialized to value familial roles
over others. They also found that involuntary childless women reared in a rural
environment found life less satisfying
due to their failure in carrying out expected roles. DeJong and Sell (1977, p.
135) noted that ‘‘childlessness is more
prevalent in urban than rural areas.”’

found the highest levels of childlessness \ Traditionally, large families have been

among those who had high-school edu-"
cations, however, not among the

 

college-educated. This is an exception
to the pattern found by most researchers.

Parental education may have an effect on rates of childlessness (Corder
and Stephan, 1984). Parents are role
models, and to the extent that a pursui
of education is valued, daughters may
consider remaining childless. Ory
(1978) suggested that a mother’s example of working outside the home could
serve as an example to be a nonparent.

Conflicting results about ethnicity
and childlessness have been reported.
Kunz and Brinkerhoff (1969) hypothesized that people believe whites are
more prone to childlessness than nonwhites; but, using data from the 1960
Census, they showed blacks had higher
rates of childlessness than whites.
Veevers (1982) showed that childlessness was higher for young cohorts of
whites, but still higher for older cohorts
of blacks. Finally, Mosher and Bachrach
(1982) found lower rates of voluntary
childlessness among blacks than among
whites. We are not aware of any researchers who have examined rates of
childlessness for other ethnic groups.
We shall examine the childless rates for
blacks, whites, and other groups.

s

the rule in rural areas, while urban families tend to be smaller. Houseknecht
(1987) reviews several additional studies
that have reported higher rates of childlessness in urban areas. She notes appropriately, however, that several of the
samples were drawn from urban areas,
and this may have influenced the results.
Regional differences in the rate of childlessness may also exist. We shall exam
‘ine both urban-rural and regional differ
ences.

The role of religion in childlessness
may be significant. Because religion has
such a great effect on the personal belief
and value system of an individual, it cannot be ignored. Mosher and Hendershot
(1984, p. 677) concluded that “religious
affiliation continues to be an indispensable datum for understanding fertility differences in the United States.” Their
study indicated that fertility was positively related to religious affiliation
among white Protestants and Catholics,
as well as Jewish couples. Ory (1978)
also found nonparents were less likely to
consider themselves religious, attended
religious services less often, and were
more likely to declare themselves atheists or agnostics than parents. Pol (1983)
found lack of religion associated with
childlessness. Mosher and Bachrach
(1982) found the nonreligious and ProtDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

estants to have higher rates of childlessness than others, while Poston (1976)
found the highest rates of childlessness
among Baptists and Methodists, though
Catholics were close to them, and all
others had much lower rates.

Marital status affects the parenting
decision. Marrying and having children
continue to prevail as the norm for most
people in the United States, and this is
not likely to change for the majority
(Veevers, 1973). Conversely, those who
have not married or are living in an informal marriage without legal sanction
should exhibit higher levels of childlessness. Mosher and Bachrach (1982)
noted that marital status was an important correlate of childlessness.

Finally, biology plays a role in childlessness. We focus on correlates of those
who are voluntarily childless. In the end
we include the involuntarily childless,
those who are sterile for noncontraceptive reasons and those who are subfecund. We then recompute the total rates
of childless so that the total impact can
be ascertained.

SAMPLE

The Cycle III of the National Survey
for Family Growth, 1982, provides an
excellent sample of childless women for
study. Approximately 8,000 women
ages 15-44 were extensively interviewed on personal background as well
as expectations for additional children.
Those 15-19 years of age were excluded
as they probably have yet to crystallize
their family ideals. The childless are
those 363 women, aged 20—44, who reported having no children and expecting
none. First, we report the percentage of
women who are childless in each category of the variables considered. Then
all of the variables are considered simultaneously to show adjusted percentages

of childlessness when the other variables
are controlled. Eta measures the
strength of the relationship between
each independent variable and childlessness.

One limitation of the data set is that
none of the questions were directed toward reasons for childlessness since the
survey included women 15-44, most of
whom planned to have or already had
children. Thus we rely on demographic
variables as predictors of childlessness.

RESULTS

The results are presented in Table 1.
The best predictor variable is marital
status. As expected, the highest rates of
childlessness are among the nevermarried and the informally married.
The lowest rates are among the married
and divorced or separated. Many nevermarried women who know they have
fertility problems expect to remain
childless. The eta for marital status becomes even more important when the
effects of the other variables are added
in, rising from 0.14 to 0.20 for voluntarily childless women.

As expected, age has an approximately linear relationship with childlessness; the older the women, the more
likely they are to remain childless. This
increase in expected childlessness in
many cases is likely a revision of earlier
intentions. Some of the revision probably also reflects the discovery of infertility or difficulties in pregnancy, childbearing, or childrearing. Furthermore,
some women may change their plans as
divorce or other problems arise. Still
others may become involved in career
opportunities, or fail to marry and thus
choose to remain childless. A countertrend may actually be hidden in these
results. Acceptance of a childless life

may be stronger among younger cohorts
of women, but be concealed by the more
pronounced trends accompanying age.
Education is also related to the decision to remain childless, but in a slightly
curvilinear way as shown in Table 1.
Schooling provides more options for a
woman than the traditional role of
motherhood. Many choose to take advantage of these new opportunities, and
children no longer become as high a priority as they have in the past. This effect
is most evident at the post-college level
where 10.6 per cent of the fecund
women are childless. Women who had
less than a complete high-school education had slightly higher levels of childlessness than those with a high-school
degree or some college. These slightly
higher rates may be a result of less stable
marriages or more health problems
among the poor. This curvilinear relationship persists when adjustments are
made for all the other variables. This indicates that age, marital status, and

other factors are not operating to produce the higher rates of childlessness
among those women with low levels of
education.

Mother’s education shows a consistent linear pattern. Nearly 11 per cent of
the fecund women whose mothers have
post-college education are childless, a
substantial increase over women who
have less education. Nevertheless, the
results are not statistically significant.
Houseknecht (1978) explains that childlessness often occurs among women
who have dominant mothers. An educated mother would be more powerful,
and perhaps more dominant and influential than a poorly educated mother.
An alternative explanation is that the
mother represents a nontraditional role
model for the daughter. In either case,
the effect is not strong enough to be statistically significant in this sample. Father’s education does not show any consistent pattern.

Participation in the labor force makes

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

Vol. 35, No. 3—4

a difference in rates of childlessness.
The highest rates of childlessness occur
among those working and those who indicate that they are not working (e.g.,
temporarily unemployed). The next
highest rate is for those in school, and
the lowest rates are among those who
specify their status as “keeping house.”
These results are consistent with traditional role expectations for working
women and for homemakers.

Black-white differences in childlessness are substantial and significant.
Consistent with Veevers (1982) and
Mosher and Bachrach (1982), we found
higher rates of voluntary childlessness
among whites (5.5 per cent) than among
blacks (3.6 per cent). This difference is
even more pronounced when the other
factors are controlled; the rates become
6.1 for whites and 2.8 for blacks. The
highest rates of voluntary childlessness
were among Asians (7.7 per cent) and,
surprisingly, among American Indians
(5.9 per cent). The number of Asians
and Indians in the sample is quite small,
however, and the rates thus subject to
wide sampling fluctuations. Hispanics
had the lowest rate of childlessness (1.6
per cent). When the rates were adjusted
for the other variables, the rate for Indians became 7.4 per cent, the highest of
any of the groups.

Despite the predictions drawn from
findings and comments by Poston
(1976), Ory (1978), Pol (1983), Mosher
and Bachrach (1982), and Mosher and
Hendershot (1984), religion has almost
no effect on childlessness. Those claiming no religious affiliation and those who
list their affiliation as other than traditional churches report higher rates of
childlessness, but the number of individuals was fairly small and the overall eta
for religion is not statistically significant.
The differences between Catholics,

Childlessness Among American Women

193

mainline Protestants, and fundamentalist Protestants are small, especially after
controls have been applied. Mosher and
Hendershot (1984) indicate that although religion should be considered in
determining fertility rates, other factors
(such as ethnicity) also have an effect.
They argue that religion alone cannot be
used to determine childlessness rates.
We found no effect for religion.

Regional differences in childlessness
are minor, though statistically significant. The primary differences are a
somewhat higher rate of childlessness in
the Northeast and a still slightly higher
rate in the West.

Several previous researchers have
found urban-rural differences in childlessness. But the way in which most
samples have been obtained evidently
influenced this variable, for we find no
difference in rates of childlessness in urban and rural areas. The urban rate is
slightly higher (4.8 per cent compared to
4.1 per cent), but the eta for this difference is not statistically significant. Furthermore, when the percentage is adjusted for the other variables, the two
rates are close, 4.7 compared to 4.3. The
norm for large families traditionally associated with rural areas may be changing, making rural rates similar to urban
rates.

When all childless women are considered (see Table 2), the strength of most
of the correlates is diminished slightly.
This is because infecundity and subfecundity are unrelated to race, region,
education, etc. Note in Table 2 that fecundity status is the best predictor of intent to remain childless. The one variable that has a closer relationship to
childlessness in Table 2 than in Table 1 is
marital status. In particular, over 35 per
cent of the subfecund or infecund who
have never married expect to remain

childless. This finding suggests that
many of them do not expect or intend to
marry.

DISCUSSION

At present, the total rate of childlessness is a relatively small per cent (6.4) of
all women aged 20-44. Childlessness
exceeds 10 per cent only among unusual
subgroups such as the highly educated,
the never married, the unemployed,
American Indians, the nonreligious,
and the noncontraceptively sterile. Furthermore, some of the presently childless may later decide to have children.
Nevertheless, the identification of those
influences that affect the decision to
have or not have children is important.
Some of the variables reflect structural

and normative changes that have occurred in society.

Most of the predictor variables culled
from the literature are not strongly related to childlessness. Small subgroup
differences suggest that childbearing remains a dominant role in most segments
of American society. That large groups
of women will choose not to have any
children in the near future is doubtful.
Nevertheless, variation in childlessness
exists. The most important demographic predictors were fecundity status
and marital status followed by age. Less
important, but still significant, were labor force status and woman’s education
and race. Mother’s education, father’s
education, urban-rural residence, region, and religion had negligible effects.
The failure of some of these variables to

predict childlessness may reflect
changes in American society. More
likely, their appearance in earlier studies reflects the nonrepresentative sampling procedures used in earlier studies
or the failure to control for other variables such as age, education, and laborforce status.

The low explained variance in the
present study is partly a function of
small percentage of childlessness in the
total sample. It also indicates that other
variables may explain additional vari

ance. We have relied on demographic
variables; the respondents were not directly questioned about their reasons for
remaining childless since the central focus of the survey was not about childlessness. Thus, social-psychological and
personality variables could not be included in the analysis. They, no doubt,
would add additional understanding of
the decision to remain childless in a society whose norms prescribe childbirth for
most couples.
