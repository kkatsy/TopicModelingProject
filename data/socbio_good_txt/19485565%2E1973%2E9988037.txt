Factors Associated with Utilization of
Family Planning Clinics in Costa Rica

The adoption of family planning and contraceptive use in a society is a function of
the modernization process. Societies which
are highly industrialized and urbanized are
those which typically have the highest proportion of couples practicing family planning. In the process of moving toward an
urban-industrial style of life, however, the
rate of adoption differs for subgroups in the
population. In the West, the concept of
family planning and the use of new contraceptive techniques were adopted first by the
upper and middle classes, and by residents
of urban areas (Hawthorn, 1970). Although
these same differentials can now be found
in many developing countries of Latin
America, Asia, and Africa, a new variable in
the form of organized family planning programs, both governmental and private, has
been added.

In the developing countries, the results
of surveys to determine the correlates of
interest in family planning have shown that
education, parity, age, and interval since
last birth are consistently important variables (Berelson, 1969). Both education and
parity tend to be positively related to interest in family planning, while interval since

last birth is negatively related. Age has a
curvilinear relationship, with women in the
age group between 25 and 34 showing the
greatest interest. Despite the fact that many
people feel it ought to be an important variable, religion generally shows little relationship to interest in family planning.

However, interest in family planning is
not the same thing as practice. The basic
philosophy of most family planning programs is that the concept of family planning and the use of contraceptives can be
disseminated through all strata of society.
Many family planning clinics are set up to
reach the lower-income and less-educated
segments of society, if not explicitly, at
least implicitly by offering services free or
at a low cost.

The basic questions to be addressed in
this paper concern the correlates of clinic
utilization. Are the factors found to be
correlated with interest in family planning
also related to clinic attendance, or do
family planning clinics appeal only to a
limited subgroup of those women interested
in family planning? Secondly, what differences exist between women who drop out
of clinics and those who remain active?

Since an examination of the first question requires comparing women who utilize
family planning clinics with those who do
not, most of the literature dealing with the
characteristics of clinic attenders in developing countries is not directly relevant.
A study of family planning clients in Barbados, however, has examined some characteristics of women attending family planning
clinics in comparison to the characteristics
of women in the total population (Ebanks,
1969). In this study, it was found that
clinic attenders tend to come from the
lower socioeconomic groups and are more
likely to be married than women in the total
population. As was the case for studies of
interest in family planning, religious affiliation showed little relationship to clinic
attendance.

In the United States, a study of lowincome obstetric patients in Michigan found
high parity, a high-school education, high
accessibility to the clinics, and a short
interval since the last birth to be associated
with attendance at family clinics (Collier,
Have, and Speare, 1967). Age and interval
since last birth were found to be important
factors in studies of low-income women in
Charlotte, North Carolina, and black lowincome women in New Orleans, Louisiana
(Siegel et al., 1970; McCalister and Thiesson, 1970). In both cases, younger women
and those with recent pregnancies were
more likely to be clinic attenders. It is also
significant that in these studies psychological factors were generally found to have
little relationship to clinic attendance.

Concerning the second question, research
on the correlates of continuation in family
planning clinics has been somewhat inconsistent in its results. Speidel and Wiener
(1970) note that several studies have not
been able to establish a relationship between continuation and characteristics such
as age, education, occupation, size of family,
religion, income, or ethnicity. However, in

Family Planning in Costa Rica

161

their own study of low-income women in
a New York clinic, Speidel and Wiener
found that women who continued in the
clinic tended to be younger (35 and under
vs. over 35) and to have more children
living at home than the women who dropped
out.

In contrast to these limited findings, a
study of clinic enrollees in North Carolina
found that several demographic and social
characteristics were correlated with continuation in family planning clinics (Seigel
et al., 1971). Clinic continuation was found
to be positively related to age (under 20 vs.
20 and older), education, children living at
home, and age at first intercourse (under
17 vs. 17 or older). Being white and married were also positively related to clinic
continuation. On the other hand, like the
studies of clinic attendance, psychological
characteristics of the women showed no
relationship to continuation in the clinics.

In general, then, the inconsistency of the
published research, and the lack of information on developing countries, indicate a
need for additional research on utilization
of family planning clinics. The present
paper reports some results of an exploratory
study to identify demographic, social, sexual
experience/knowledge, and psychological
factors that are related to clinic utilization
in a sample of Costa Rican women.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
SAMPLE

The sampling design utilized in the selection of women for analysis resulted in what
is best designated as a modified cluster
sample. Areas served by six family planning
clinics in Costa Rica were selected as being
representative of the larger target population, representing primarily low-income
woinen. There was one exception, however.
Most of the Negro population of Costa
Rica (less than 5% of the total population)
is located on the east coast in the province

162 Michielutte et al.

of Limon. Since there were no governmentsponsored family planning clinics located
in Limon at the time of the survey (1970),
and since Limon is isolated by mountains
and jungle, this area was not sampled.
Thus, virtually no Negroes were obtained
in the final sample.

Within each clinic area, households were
randomly sampled, and eligible women in
the household were interviewed. The requirements for eligibility were that the
woman be between the ages of 15 and 49
and that she had experienced at least one
pregnancy.

Since an important goal of the study was
to compare women who had attended a
family planning clinic with those who had
never attended, a further restriction was
that approximately equal numbers of women
in the attended and never-attended categories be sampled. In order to obtain this
distribution, the total number of interviews
to be completed in each clinic area was
determined (on the basis of a final sample
size of approximately 1,500) and households randomly sampled in each area until
the proper distribution was obtained.

This procedure resulted in a sample of
1,652 interviews (approximately 4.8% of
the target population) of which 1,498 were
found to be usable. The actual number of
cases used for each analysis, however, varies
somewhat due to missing responses on specific questions.

DEFINITION OF VARIABLES

Two aspects of clinic utilization were
studied: clinic attendance and clinic continuation. Clinic attendance was defined as
a dummy variable in which women who
ever attended (actives and dropouts) were
assigned a score of one. Women who had
never been to a clinic were assigned a score
of zero.

The definition of clinic continuation as a
dummy variable was based only on a com
Social Biology

parison of actives and dropouts. Women
who were still active at the time of the
interview were assigned a scofe of one, and
women who had dropped out at the time of
the interview were assigned a Score of zero.
Women who had never attended were not
considered in this part of the analysis.

Although the correlations between clinic
attendance, clinic continuation, and all variables initially examined are shown in Table
1, space limitations do not allow a complete
discussion of the operational definition for
every independent variable. For this reason,
only the variables found to be of some explanatory importance in a multiple regression analysis have been discussed in detail.
In this regard, the criterion for retention of
a variable was that it contribute an increment of at least one per cent to the total
explained variation in clinic attendance or
clinic continuation.

It is important, however, to point out
certain unusual features of some variables
not retained for further analysis. It was
noted earlier that accessibility to clinics was
one of the variables previously found to be
correlated with clinic attendance. The one
indirect measure of accessibility among the
variables shown in Table 1 is that of urbanrural residence, the rural clinics being much
more difficult for many women to attend.
Unfortunately, the sampling design eliminates this variable as a factor in clinic
attendance. The modified cluster sampling
plan assured approximately equal numbers
of attenders and nonattenders in both urban
and rural communities. Thus, no relationship between urban-rural residence and
clinic attendance was possible. This variable
is relevant for clinic continuation, however,
and the fact that no relationship was found
suggests that accessibility, as measured by
urban-rural residence, is not an important
factor in whether a woman remains active or
drops out.

knowledge variables, the measures of reproductive and contraceptive knowledge cannot
be used as predictors of clinic attendance.
An important aspect of the family planning
clinics in Costa Rica is a program of education in reproduction and contraception.
Thus, to a large extent, higher reproductive
and contraceptive knowledge is a consequence rather than an antecedent of clinic
attendance.

The final point to be discussed concerning the variables eliminated from the analysis is with respect to the problem of
multicollinearity (high intercorrelations
between independent variables). An analysis of the independent variables revealed
two clusters of intercorrelated variables.
The first set included age, age at first con

ception, age at first intercourse, and age at
which respondent first learned of contraception. These variables have an average intercorrelation of 0.45.

The relatively high correlations between
age and the sexual experience variables are
partially artifacts of the sampling design
which included only women with at least
one pregnancy. This assured that all the
younger women in the sample had a young
age at first conception and, at least for
attenders, a young age when they first
learned of contraception. On the other
hand, the older women constitute a more
complete cohort of women who have ever
had children, many having a higher age
at first conception.

Since actual age showed the strongest

164 Michielutte et al.

direct relationship to clinic attendance it
was retained for further analysis. It is important to note, however, that for this
sample, age is also a crude indicator of the
sexual experience variables.

A second cluster of variables to show
high intercorrelations are the semanticdifferential evaluation scales for the concepts of husband, self, having children, and
the church. These variables all showed high
intercorrelations (average r= 0.64) and
all showed approximately the same positive
relationship with clinic attendance. This
suggested a kind of optimism-pessimism
response set which influences evaluation of
all concepts rated, despite specific content.
However, this âsetâ varied with attendance,
attenders having a more positive outlook.
The scale that appeared to most closely
represent this set was the judgement of
âself,ââ and this measure was the only one
retained. It should be emphasized, however,
that the âselfâ scale has a somewhat broader
meaning and must be interpreted with caution. .

All other independent variables not included in the detailed analysis were eliminated on the basis of low partial correlations with clinic attendance and clinic
continuation, and they showed no unusual
features. Of the variables considered, only
eight were retained for further analysis.
Age and parity are represented as exact
age in years and number of live births. The
other six were operationally defined as
follows:

Income. Income was measured in colones,
which had an exchange rate of approximately 6.6 to the dollar at the time of the
interview. The family income of each
woman was recorded in broad categories of
width 300, except for the two end categories. Each woman was assigned the midpoint of the category in which she fell.

Race. It was stated earlier that virtually
no Negroes were included in the sample.

 

Social Biology

Thus, nonwhite refers primarily to persons
of Indian ancestry. Race has been defined
as a dummy variable in which nonwhites
have been assigned a score of one and
whites a score of zero. It should be noted
here that in the present sample virtually
all nonwhites are found in the rural clinic
areas.

Self-concept Scale. A complete discussion
of the semantic differential can be found in
Osgood, Suci, and Tannenbaum (1957).
Briefly, the method uses pairs of adjectives
to measure a subjectâs affective judgements
about some object along three dimensionsâ
evaluation, potency, and activity. The
evaluative dimension essentially represents
a positive versus negative judgement of
any given concept. The four sets of evaluative adjectives used to compute the âselfâ
scale are: (1) kind-inconsiderate, (2)
honest-dishonest, (3) just-unjust, and (4)
good-bad.

The responses to each set of adjectives
were skewed toward the positive end on a
scale of one to seven. In order to minimize
the effect of extreme cases, the responses
at the lower end of the scale were collapsed.
The final scale used was the mean of the
collapsed scores for the four sets of adjectives and ranged from a low of one to a
high of four.

Internal-external Control Scale. The internal-external control scale (IE scale) essentially measures the strength of a personâs
belief that he can control his own destiny
rather than being a victim of fate and
chance. The score used in the present analysis is a very short version of the original
scale developed by Rotter (1966). The ten
questions which correlated best with the
total scales in Rotterâs female sample were
selected from the original twenty-three
questions. The responses (agree-disagree)
to these ten questions were subjected to
factor analysis and found to be multidimensional. A subset of four questions, however,

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:33 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 20, No. 2

appeared to represent the dimension of
internal-external control. These four items
were used to compute the current IE score.
The score ranges from a low of zero to a
high of four, the high score indicating a
strong belief in the individualâs ability to
control his/her own destiny.

Birth Control Scale. The attitude toward
birth control scale was computed from four
items concerned with the relationship of
birth control to health, its expense, importance for national welfare, and the ease
with which it can be understood. The
women expressed agreement or disagreement with each statement on a five-point
scale ranging from âstrongly agreeâ to
âstrongly disagree.â In computing the scale,
the most negative answer was assigned a
score of zero and the most positive answer a
score of four. The scale consists of the
sum of scores for all four items. Thus, a
person with a completely negative attitude
toward all aspects of birth control included
in the four items would have a score of
zero. A respondent with a highly positive
attitude would have a score of sixteen.

Family Planning Scale. The family planning scale is a summary score based on
response (agree-disagree) to thirteen negative statements about family planning, contraception, and clinic utilization. Since these
statements are analyzed separately in Table
5 they will not be discussed in detail at
this point, except to note that the summary
score is based on a positive or negative
response to these statements. The respondent was assigned a zero if she agreed with
the statement and a one if she disagreed.
Thus, a woman negative toward all aspects
of family planning covered in the statements received a total score of zero. A
woman agreeing with none of the negative
statements received a score of thirteen.

It should be noted that the family planning scale and the birth control scale overlap conceptually to some extent. However,

 

Family Planning in Costa Rica

 

162

the correlation between them is not high
(ry = 0.21) and thus causes no problems of
multicollinearity. The birth control score
can best be thought of as measuring very
general feelings about birth control, while
the family planning score focuses on some
specific aspects of contraception, family
planning, and clinic procedures.

RESULTS

The basic technique used to examine
these data was multiple regression analysis.
The independent variables were first
checked for possible nonlinear relationships,
entered into a stepwise regression analysis,
and then correlated in various combinations
to check for possible suppressor relationships among variables that showed no
initial correlation with clinic attendance or
continuation.

Although it would have been desirable to
examine all variables and all possible interaction terms simultaneously, the capacity of
the computer used for the analysis did not
allow this. Thus, only the variables retained
according to the criterion of adding at least
one per cent to the total explained variation
were checked for interaction. For these
variables, no appreciable interaction was
detected.

Given the nature of the sample and the
large number of cases, little attention has
been paid to tests of statistical significance
in the interpretation of results. The results
of such tests, however, are presented in the
tables.

CLINIC ATTENDANCE

The seven variables found to be of some
importance in predicting clinic attendance
are parity, income, age, race, the internalexternal control (IE) scale, the family planning scale, and the self-concept scale. The
distribution of the variables and the zeroorder correlations with clinic attendance
are shown in Table 2. It can be seen that,

Â¢ Age, income, family planning scale, and self-concept scale have been categorized for tabular presentation. However,
correlations between clinic attendance and these variables were computed from exact scores.
The curvilinear equation for age is Y = a-+-6X âcX?, where Y =clinic attendance and X = age. The curvilinear
equation for the self-concept scale is Y=aâ dX -+cX?, where Y =clinic attendance and X = self-concept, In both

with the exception of parity, all the correlations with clinic attendance are moderately low.

In the case of parity, the initial relationship with clinic attendance is almost non
existent. Parity becomes important, however, with the introduction of a control for
age. Table 3 shows the relationship between
parity and clinic attendance within broad
categories of age. It can be seen that

"e clinic attendance is not a function of ruralÂ© ness; white women in the urban and rural
areas have higher rates of attendance than

With respect to the IE score, women who
have a stronger belief in their ability to
control their own destiny are more likely
to be clinic attenders, although in this case
the correlation is quite low.

Women with a more positive attitude
toward family planning are more likely to
be clinic attenders, and lower income women
are more likely to be clinic attenders. The
negative relationship between income and

t

clinic attendance is as expected since the
clinics provide a number of free services
aimed at reaching the poorer segment of
the population. |

As noted previously, the relationship between age and clinic attendance shows some
nonlinearity. This is also true of the selfconcept scale. For age, a relatively low
percentage of younger women are attenders,
the percentage increases to a maximum
between the ages of 25-29 and declines at
the higher ages. The distribution of the
self-concept scale is just the reverse of age.
A fairly high percentage of women with a
low self-concept are attenders; the percentage of attenders declines for women in the
middle-ranges of the self-concept scale; and
it is highest for women with a high selfconcept.

Both the linear and nonlinear components of the relationships are shown in
Table 2. For age, the addition of the nonlinear component raises the explained variation from 5% to 7%. For the self-concept
scale, the nonlinear component raises the
explained variation from 5% to 6%. The
increment in the multiple regression coefficient from the nonlinear components
raises the total explained variation (for all
variables) from 22% to 24%.

The multiple regression analysis of all
variables is shown in Table 4. The total explained variation of 24% suggests that the
seven variables are of some importance in
distinguishing between attenders and nonattenders. The standardized regression coefficients indicate that age is the most important variable in terms of the ability to
produce a change (statistically) in the
proportion of attenders. Parity, income,
race, the self-concept scale, and the family
planning scale are somewhat Jess important
and about equal in power, while the IE
scale is least important. The direction of
each partial relationship is the same as for
the zero-order correlations,

CLINIC CONTINUATION

Only three variables were found to bear
some relationship to clinic continuation: the
birth control scale, the IE scale, and the
family planning scale. It is significant to
note that only psychological items were
found to be important here. Apparently the
decision to remain active or drop out of a
clinic is not directly dependent on the
background characteristics or sexual experience/knowledge of a woman.

The distribution of the independent vartiables and the correlations with clinic continuation are shown in Table 5. All relationships were found to be basically linear in
form and all are relatively low. Women
more favorable toward birth control who
have a stronger belief in their ability to
control their own destiny and who have
a more favorable attitude toward the
various aspects of family planning are more
likely to remain active in the family planning clinics.

The multiple regression analysis shown in
Table 6 indicates that only about 7% of
the variation in clinic continuation can be

explained by the three variables acting
together. The standardized regression coefficients indicate that the family planning
scale is approximately twice as important as
either of the other independent variables
in producing a change in the proportion
of attenders remaining active. The direction of all partial relationships remains the
same as for the zero-order correlations.

FAMILY PLANNING SCALE

Two variables were found to be related
to both clinic attendance and clinic continuation. Interpretation of the IE scale is fairly
straightforward. The correlations were low,
but suggested that women who feel they
have more control over their lives are more
likely to attend family planning clinics and
also to remain active.

The family planning scale, however, is
somewhat more complicated. It is composed of many diverse items, and a more
specific examination of the separate items
will be helpful in understanding this scaleâs
relationship to clinic attendance and clinic
continuation. Table 7 shows the proportion

The results shown in Table 7 indicate
that women classified as active in the clinics
generally have a lower percentage with
negative feelings about these aspects of
family planning than either the dropout or
never-been groups. The latter two groups
are quite close on almost all of the items.

For all groups, the health and medical
examination aspects of family planning
(Items 1, 3, 4, 6) and those items concerned
with the fact that the clinics are free (Item
5) and that women have to wait too long
to be seen (Item 2) show the highest proportion of women with negative responses.
The fear that contraceptives will cause
cancer or other illnesses (Items 1 and 3) is
particularly strong among the dropout and
never-been groups. This fear and the finding that a relatively large proportion of
women in all clinic categories have negative
feelings toward the fact that the clinics are
free suggest that two points which should
be emphasized by family planning educational programs are the negation of health
fears and reassurance about quality of
service despite the lack of charges.

It is also important to note that resistance on the part of the husbands (13),
negative reinforcement from friends and
neighbors (11), and religious objections
(12) apparently are of little importance to

most of the women in all three groups. The
results with respect to religion are in accord with the findings noted earlier, while
the negative results with respect to worry
about resistance on the part of husbands
and negative reinforcement from friends
and neighbors tends to contradict much
current thinking in the area of family planning (Bogue, 1967). However, it should be
noted that these results may be specific to
Costa Rican family structure.

REASONS FOR DISCONTINUING CLINIC
ATTENDANCE

The analysis of clinic continuation suggested that background and sexual experience/knowledge factors were of little
predictive importance. Psychological variables were found to be of some importance;
but two of the three were concerned with
attitudes about birth control and family
planning/clinic procedures. This finding,
the preceding analysis of the specific negative statements about family planning, and
the results of the other studies concerned
with specific clinic procedures and problems
(Speidel and Wiener, 1970) leads to the

hypothesis that experiences in the clinic
setting may be more important than characteristics of the women in predicting dropouts. If this is the case, some insight can be
gained by examining the reasons for discontinuing clinic attendance. The reasons
reported by the dropouts in this sample are
shown in Table 8.

These data indicate that pregnancy is by

far the most important reason for dropping
out. The response in this category refers
primarily to contraceptive failure, since a
different response was made by women who
wanted another baby. Most of the women
reporting pregnancy were using the IUD,
which along with the birth control pill is
a highly popular contraceptive technique in
Costa Rica.

The second most important factor, health
reasons, refers primarily to fear of contraception, medical examinations, etc. reported
in the preceding section. The next most important reason, the method didnât suit the
respondent, refers to the contraceptive
technique itself.

Overall, the responses suggest that physical and psychological problems with the
method of contraception are the most important reasons for dropping out of the
clinic. In addition, the earlier analysis,
which failed to predict clinic continuation
well, suggests that these problems are not
specific to particular subgroups of women.

DISCUSSION

Analysis of the factors related to clinic
attendance indicated that four background
characteristicsâparity, age, race, and incomeâwere of some importance in differentiating attenders from nonattenders. The
positive relationship between parity and
clinic attendance and the curvilinear relationship between age and clinic attendance
are in accord with the reports of interest
in family planning in developing countries.
Women of higher parity were found to be
more interested in family planning, and
women in the youngest and oldest age
groups were found to be less interested in
family planning. The results of this study
indicate that, in Costa Rica, these relationships also apply to attendance at family
planning clinics.

It is of particular interest to note that
initially parity and clinic attendance

Family Planning in Costa Rica

171

showed no relationship. A positive relationship emerged when age was introduced
as a control. Statistically, this is due to a
relatively strong positive relationship between parity and clinic attendance, and the
curvilinear relationship between age and
clinic attendance. As a result, older women
of higher parity also tend to be nonattenders. Substantively, this is at least partially
due to the fact that many of the older highparity women are in the last stages of their
childbearing period and have little need of
family planning services. Also important is
the fact that the older women tend to be
most traditional in their outlook and as a
group have less interest in family planning,
regardless of their parity.

The results with respect to income and
race are important in that they point out
the success of the family planning clinics
in reaching low-income women, but a relative lack of success in reaching the nonwhite (Indian) population which is the
lowest income group in Costa Rica. As
noted earlier, the negative relationship between income and clinic attendance is as
expected since the clinics provide a number
of services oriented toward the low-income
population. However, the fact that nonwhites are less likely to attend than whites
may suggest an area of needed improvement in the family planning programs.

Perhaps the most important results with
respect to clinic attendance are those which
suggest that psychological variables may be
of greater importance than previously be
1The general relationship between parity and
clinic attendance is somewhat attenuated by the
sampling restriction that the women have had at
least one pregnancy. Since very few women who
have never been pregnant attend family planning
clinics in the developing countries, inclusion of
these women would have sharply reduced the
mean parity of all nonattenders, but would have
had little effect on the mean parity of attenders.
Thus, it is important to emphasize that our conclusions with respect to parity (and all other variables as well) are limited to women with at least
one pregnancy.

lieved. The curvilinear relationship between
self-concept and clinic attendance is difficult to assess, but apparently the clinics
appeal more to women with either high or
low self-concepts. It should be recalled,
however, that the self-concept scale is part
of a set which reflects a generally positive
or negative orientation much broader than
the self, so that interpretation is complicated.

The IE scale results are more straightforward. Women who feel more in control
of their lives are more likely to attend
clinics and to remain active once they have
begun participation.

This scale, and other measures of the
activism-fatalism dimension, have been
shown to be related to birth control behavior and attitudes in a number of studies
in different countries and with differing
types of subjects (Williamson, 1970; MacDonald, 1970; Rainwater, 1965; Hill, Stycos, and Back, 1959). Elsewhere, we have

Social Biology

pointed out the need for research on the
psychological variables which mediate between social forces and reproductive behavior, with the object of identifying
motives or attitudes which can be altered
by educational or other techniques (Cochrane et al., 1973). The activism dimension
would clearly appear to be one such motive
with respect to attendance at family planning clinics.

The general results with respect to
clinic continuation are important in that
they suggest that fears and negative experiences relating to contraception and clinic
procedures, and contraceptive failure, are
more important than the characteristics of
the women themselves in predicting clinic
dropouts.
