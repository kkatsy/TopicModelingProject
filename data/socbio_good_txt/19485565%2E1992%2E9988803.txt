wn ABSTRACT: This pilot study explored the association between a measure of water pollution caused
& by benzene or chlorinated solvents and the incidence of low birth weights for white residents of
“ Michigan counties. A positive relationship between water pollution by these contaminants and
& the per cent of low-weight births (< 2,500 grams, or about 5.5 pounds) resulted despite controls
& for the incidence of teenaged childbearing, infrequent prenatal care, and mean household income
9 from wages or salaries. Water pollution showed an association with the incidence of low birth
CQ weight that was as strong as that between low birth weight and low prenatal care. While
& correlation cannot prove causation, the finding suggests that impure water may impair fetal

s+ growth in Michigan.

In lesser developed countries, the
quantity of the household’s water supéoply seems to be positively related to in5 fant and young-child survival. For ex= ample, data from such disparate places
‘Sas Brazil, Peninsular Malaysia, and
Egypt showed that children had much
Blower odds of childhood mortality if
‘<= they came from households with piped
water (Casterline et al., 1989; Da&=Vanzo and Habicht, 1986; DaVanzo,
2 1988; Merrick, 1985; Victora et al.,
31986). While the presence of an indoor
‘Sor outdoor faucet symbolized a higher
& socioeconomic status, it appeared to
convey an ameliorative environmental
effect on child mortality beyond that
exerted by such other socioeconomic
factors as maternal education (in all
three countries), paternal education or
occupation (in the Brazilian and Egyptian studies), household income (in the
Brazilian and Egyptian studies), or access to a toilet (in all three countries).
Merrick (1985) speculated that the
larger quantities of water available
through piping increased the frequency

of washing and reduced the exposure
to infectious bacteria.

In more developed countries, the
purity of a household’s drinking water
may be as important as its quantity for
children’s health, especially in the prenatal period.! For example, if pregnant
women drink polluted water which disturbs fetal growth, then one would expect to see higher rates of spontaneous
abortions, congenital malformations,
and low birth weights. An industrial
accident in San Jose, California, provided a test of this possibility. Organic
solvents leaked from a storage tank of
a semiconductor firm in 1980-81 and
contaminated a well of local drinking
water. Because one of the pollutants,
trichaloroethane (TCA), was found in
concentrations of 8.5 times the stateaction level, the contaminated well was
closed in December, 1981.2 Local res

idents complained of an excess of miscarriages and birth defects and asked
state and county health agencies to investigate.

An elaborate research design included two experimental groups (census tracts thought to drink water from
the contaminated well) and three control groups (census tracts highly similar
in socioeconomic and racial make-up
to the experimental groups but known
to have drinking water uncontaminated with TCA). Rates of spontaneous abortions, birth defects, and low
birth weights were computed for pregnancies occurring to 1,105 women interviewees who had become pregnant
between January 1, 1980 and April 30,
1985, and who had lived in one of the
five study areas throughout the entire
pregnancy. If the contamination of the
well had elevated the rates of adverse
pregnancy outcomes, then these rates
should have been higher in 1980-81 for
the two census tracts near the well than
for the three control groups. For the
experimental period (1980-81), the researchers (Wrensch et al., 1990) found
an excess of miscarriages and malformations and a deficit of low birth
weights in one census tract exposed to
the contaminated well but a deficit of
miscarriages and malformations and an
excess of low birth weights in the other
exposed census tract. When the two
experimental groups were lumped together, these variations evened out so
that no excesses or deficits of adverse
pregnancy outcomes remained. There
were no differences between the experimental and control groups in the control period, 1982-85. The researchers

concluded that contamination of the
well with TCA probably did not produce adverse pregnancy outcomes in
San Jose, California, although it could
have had other undesirable and unmeasured medical consequences.

A related study was conducted in
northern California, where aerial
spraying of a pesticide (malathion) was
carried out in 1981-82 to combat an infestation of the Mediterranean fruit fly.
The study sought to determine whether
exposure to the pesticide was related to
spontaneous abortions (miscarriages).
After controls for a number of potentially confounding factors had been
made, it was found that the (adjusted)
risk of a miscarriage in the sprayed
area was S50 per cent higher for pregnant women who drank mainly tap water (12.5 per cent chance) than for
pregnant women who drank mainly
bottled water (8.4 per cent chance)
(Hertz-Picciotto et al., 1989). Tapwater drinkers of ground water faced
the greatest risk of all (13.8 per cent
chance). Oddly, chemical tests conducted on the water supply at its source
(ground or surface) showed nothing
unusual in this area of California. Because this study was based on interviews with women about two years
after the end of the pregnancy, forgetfulness may have biased their recall
of sources of drinking water during the
pregnancy. However, the puzzle raised
by this study is why ground water might
be less safe than surface water, which
in turn might be less safe than potable
bottled liquids. It should be remembered that “‘large’’ concentrations of
contaminants may be needed to harm
the health of adults, while only traces
of contaminants may be enough to
affect the health of the unborn.

A study reported in 1990 by the International Joint Commission (IJC, a
U.S.-Canadian committee set up by
treaty to oversee the quality of Great
Lakes waters bounding the two countries) showed how the pollution of surface water can impair the physical development of human fetuses. For
example, chinook and coho salmon
caught in Lake Michigan have been
i found to contain PCB’s (halogenated
S hydrocarbons that degrade slowly).
o The longer and fatter the salmon
caught in Lake Michigan, the heavier
their concentration of PCB’s (Swinehart, 1990, p. 17). In addition to
© PCB’s, the Great Lakes contain con+ centrations of such heavy metals as
“ mercury, lead, and cadmium, which
© are discharged into air and water by industrial factories. Accordingly, the IJC
found that women who regularly ate
= fish caught in Lake Michigan gave birth
4, to offspring whose gestational lengths,
> skull sizes, weights at birth, and cog‘2 nitive, motor, and behavioral skills
were far below average.

From these studies, we hypothe> sized that higher concentrations of con‘gj taminants in ground or surface water
3 are related to much higher rates of low
< birth weights. We tested this notion
= with data limited to white residents of
© Michigan counties, as few nonwhites

lived in the nonmetropolitan counties

comprising the bulk of our study areas.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Infants with abnormally low weights
at birth are born more often to teenagers, to women who receive insufficient prenatal care, and to women in
poverty (Carlson, 1984). Prenatal care
is usually deemed insufficient if it starts

after the first trimester of pregnancy
and consists of fewer than five visits
(Miller, 1985). Thus, a conservative investigation required us to examine the
correlation between the incidence. of
low birth weight and a measure of water pollution after the detrimental effects of youthful maternal age at birth,
insufficient prenatal care, and low socioeconomic status had been removed.
Data appropriate for this task were
taken from birth certificates registered
in 1982 according to the mother’s usual
Michigan county of residence. Because
the Michigan birth certificates recorded not only the weight of the infant
at delivery but also the race, the age of
its mother at the birth, and the number
of her prenatal visits, we could compute the percentages of all white live
births which weighed below 2,500
grams (or 5.5 pounds), which occurred
to teenagers, and which received the
benefits of five or fewer prenatal visits.
The 1980 U.S. Census of Population
was used to obtain the mean household
income in Michigan counties in 1979
from wages and salaries.

Measures of water pollution were
ascertained from Site Assessment
Scores constructed by the Michigan
Department of Natural Resources
(MDNR). These scores were used to
evaluate which locations threatened
public health and required state funds
for clean-ups. The MDNR investigated
site histories, containment structures,
release potentials, and existing exposure levels. Furthermore, a detailed
description of the chemical contaminants was developed to report their
types, quantities, associated hazards,
exposure characteristics, and concentrations. The routes (ground or surface
water, air, fire, land, or explosion)

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:44 08 December 2015

48 Witkowski and Johnson

through which a target population
might be exposed to the contaminant
were ascertained. Each reported site
was then given a numerical score ranging from 0-2000 (in increasing levels of
pollution).

The present investigation focused
on sites assessed between August 10,
1983, and February 1, 1984, the first
time period for which the MDNR computed and reported the Site Assessment Scores. Potentially polluted sites
reported to the MDNR after October
14, 1983, were not rated in time for this
1983 report (Michigan Department of
Natural Resources, 1984). Therefore,
the absence of a county from our data
list does not imply the lack of befouled
water, but rather the failure of people
to report potential water pollution by
October 14, 1983.

Many different contaminants (e.g.,
organic compounds, inorganic compounds, or heavy metals) ‘“‘stored” at a
particular site may have polluted both
the surrounding water and land. However, a given Site Assessment Score
was retained for this analysis only if a
ground or surface water route was impure from any of several organic solvents associated with birth defects or
cancer (Table 1). If more than one contaminated water site in a county qual

ified for retention in this analysis, the
geometric mean of all such Site Assessment Scores was calculated for that
county. Microbiologists prefer the geometric mean over the more familiar
arithmetic mean as an average dilution
titer (Remington and Schork, 1970, p.
27-28). That these measures of water
pollution (the independent variable)
postdate the measures of low birth
weight (the dependent variable)
should not preclude causal inference,
since the main source of water pollution in Michigan is air pollution, which
has slow and cumulative effects on the
state’s water resources. Also, since the
incidence of low birth weight was virtually the same for white infants in
Michigan in 1982 (5.52 per cent) and
1984 (5.48 per cent; National Center
for Health Statistics, 1988), it is unlikely that its causes changed appreciably during this time.

RESULTS

In Michigan, 29 counties had known
ground or surface water sites polluted
with at least one birth-deforming or
carcinogenic organic solvent in 1983
(Table 2). Eight of the counties were
metropolitan; five, nonmetropolitan
adjacent to metro counties; and six

teen, nonmetro nonadjacent to metro
counties. In fact, the county (Clare)
with the highest geometric mean water
pollution index (992) was a nonmetropolitan county nonadjacent to a metropolitan county. Evidently, water pollution in Michigan was not confined to
heavily urbanized counties. In addition, nine of the counties bordered
Lake Michigan, one bounded Lake Superior, and two touched Lake Huron
(Figure 1). The locations of these 12
counties emphasized the threat that
water pollution posed to the purity of
the Great Lakes.

In the United States as a whole, 5.59
per cent of white infants in metro counties and 5.66 per cent of white infants
in nonmetro counties weighed under
2,500 grams (about 5.5 pounds) at the
time of birth in 1982 (Johnson and
Zaki, 1988). Thus, the incidence of
low-birth-weight deliveries to white
women residing in Clare (9.22 per
cent), Kalkaska (10.6 per cent), Osceola (7.85 per cent), and Wexford (8.08
per cent) appeared excessive (see Table 2). All four of these nonmetro
counties were remote from metro
counties and had geometric mean water pollution indices above 700 (i.e.,
992, 832, 794, and 742, respectively).
Not surprisingly, the water pollution
indices were positively correlated with
the incidence of low birth weights
(r = 0.297, p < 0.06) for the 29 Michigan counties for which we had water
pollution scores.

In addition, the percentage of low
birth weights among white infants in all
83 Michigan counties in 1982 correlated strongly with the percentage of
births occurring to white women who
had made five or fewer prenatal visits
for medical care (r = 0.300, p < 0.01,
N = 83). The incidence of infrequent

prenatal visits varied directly with the
incidence of white teenaged childbearing (r = 0.382, p < 0.001, N = 83)
and inversely with average household
earnings in the county from wages and
salaries (r= —0.392, p < 0.001,
N = 83). Hence, it was necessary to
control the prevalence of insufficient
prenatal care, of teenaged childbearing, and of low earnings in the counties, since these factors might confound
the relationship between water contamination and the incidence of low
birth weights. For this purpose, we regressed the per cent of low birth
weights on these control variables,
along with the geometric mean score of
water contamination (Table 3). We
had originally planned to control the
effects of metropolitan residence on
the incidence of low birth weight; but a
strong correlation between metropolitan residence and higher mean household wages (r= 0.803, p < 0.001,
N = 83) created multicollinearity in
the multiple regression and required us
to drop the type of county from further
analysis.

The resulting regression model explained 18.08 per cent of the variance
in the incidence of low birth weights to
the white population of the 29 Michigan counties. The two variables most
strongly associated with the incidence
of low birth weight were a low incidence of prenatal visits and a high water pollution score. The unstandardized regression coefficient (b = 0.139)
showed that a 10-point rise in the percentage of women making fewer than
six prenatal visits during pregnancy
would result in a 1.39 per cent increment to the percentage of low—birthweight infants. Likewise, a 100-point
rise in the geometric mean score of
water pollution would be associated

with an increase of 0.03 per cent in

The magnitudes of the standardized regression coefficients suggested that
prenatal care and water pollution (betas = 0.315 and 0.294, respectively)

weight. This alternative way shows that

weight would occur from chance alone
much less often when the predictor is a
low incidence of prenatal care (14.5

than when it is a low mean of household earnings (86.0 per cent) or a high

view of the adverse public health outcomes of disregarding organic-solvent
water pollution when it may affect low
birth weight, this relationship should
now be explored in more detailed investigations based on large random
samples of individual women.

DISCUSSION

Most studies relating water supplies
to children’s health have examined
how piped water reduced the risks of
infant or young-child mortality in
lesser developed countries. Few studies have asked whether water impurity
retards children’s physical growth, and
even fewer answers to this question
have been sought for more developed
countries. Toward bridging this gap,
the present pilot study explored the association between a measure of water
pollution and the incidence of low birth
weights to white residents of Michigan
counties. The water pollutants of interest were benzene or chlorinated solvents known to be associated with birth
defects or cancers.

A positive relationship between the
degree of known ground or surface wa
ter pollution by these contaminants
and the incidence of low-weight births
(< 2,500 grams, or about 5.5 pounds)
was suggested in our pilot study for
Michigan. The relationship (which resulted despite controls for the effects of
teenaged childbearing, infrequent prenatal care, and mean household income from wages or salaries) accorded
with that from another study where
women who regularly ate fish from
Lake Michigan (known to be polluted
with PCB’s) bore children with belowaverage lengths of gestation and
weights and skull sizes at birth (International Joint Commission, 1990). In
our pilot study, water contamination
showed an association with the incidence of low birth weight that was as
strong as that between low birth weight
and low prenatal care.

The major finding of our study was
based on an ecological correlation between measures computed for aggregates (counties). As such, this correlation could not show whether individual
women residents who bore low-weight
infants were more likely than the other
mothers to drink water from the polluted sites (Robinson, 1950). This lat

ter relationship should now _ be
explored in more detailed investigations based on large random samples of
individual women. These new studies
should be prospective rather than retrospective so as to record accurately
the source(s) of drinking water (tapped
or bottled and ground or surface) during the pregnancy and to analyze the
composition of the water at the point of
consumption rather than at the point
of supply. Also, these investigations
should take into account the usage during the pregnancy of alcohol, nicotine,
caffeine, and other drugs known or
suspected to affect fetal growth. Such
work can reveal whether the inverse
association between socioeconomic
status and adverse pregnancy outcomes shown so consistently in past re

of risk based on the knowing or unwitting ingestion of chemicals.
