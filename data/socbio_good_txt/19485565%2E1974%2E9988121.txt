Migration and Genetic Kinship in

Eastern Greenland

Introduction of medical assistance usually produces a fast increase in previously
constant population sizes. In small communities, intensive birth control and emigration may reverse the process in very
few years. Throughout these demographic
changes, genetic kinship may be expected
to vary suddenly with changes in population size and migration. We have tried to
measure the possible fluctuation of genetic
kinship, using two settlements in Eastern
Greenland as a practical example.

Information about the history, ethnography, demography, and genealogies of
East Greenlanders since their discovery
have been collected by R. Gessain (1969)
in Ammassalik and J. Robert (1970) in
the Scoresby Sund district. The unusual
history of these populations allows a biological analysis of the observed and expected
consequences of a population explosion
followed by the sudden adoption of birth
control in a small community.

We will summarize what is known
about population size and migration in
Eastern Greenland, first during the nineteenth century and earlier and then during
the twentieth century. For our study, we
will use deterministic simulations of the

evolution of kinship to isolate the possible
effect of changes in population size and
migration pattern, without consideration
of the breeding structure which is assumed
to be panmictic. Some parameters are
unmeasurable or too small to be estimated.
Extreme and medium population estimates
are considered according to the information available.

HISTORY OF THE POPULATION

NINETEENTH CENTURY

The first contact with inhabitants of
Eastern Greenland was made in 1823 by
an Englishman named Clavering who found
12 Eskimos living in a tent at 74° N.
These Eskimos were probably summer
migrants, part of a population close to a
demographic minimum due to ecological
hazards. No Eskimo was ever seen again
at this latitude, but some of them may
have reached the settlement of Ammassalik nine degrees to the south. Oral tradition has it that immigrants came to
Ammassalik from the north some 150-200
years ago.

During Graah’s Konebat Expedition in
1832, the population of Southeastern
Greenland between Cape Farewell and

65° N. was estimated at 480. However,
by 1883-84, only 135 were counted in a
census of the area by G. Holm, a Dane.
These were people who had not yet migrated south, attracted by the European
goods available on the western coast. By
the end of the nineteenth century, the
southeastern coast was uninhabited. A few
people had moved to the north to Ammassalik and these immigrants can be traced
in our genealogies of the present population.

It was not until 1884 that the first European contact was made with the Ammassalimiut (people living in Ammassalik).
G. Holm found 413 people living along
three great fiords and on several islands
between 65°30’ and 66°30’ N. The 413
Ammassalimiut of whom Holm made a census in 1884-85 were a reduced population.
We know that several families had died of
starvation in 1882-83. Since whole families perished, this loss would not have
changed the age structure of the population (43 per cent of the population 15
years old or younger). Before this disaster,
there were probably 480 to 500 people living in Ammassalik. This number is rather
high for Eskimo hunters, but it is in keeping with the technology and hunting possibilities in the area at that time. It may
be postulated that the prehistoric population fluctuated between four-hundred and
five-hundred individuals.

PREHISTORIC PAST

Before the nineteenth century, our only
information on populations in the area
comes from interesting but incomplete
archaeological data. The first known immigrants came from the western coast of
Greenland via the south in the fourteenth
century. Since the Vikings had been settled
on the southwestern coast for some four
hundred years, it is possible that admixture had occurred prior to the time of

273

immigration. Technological changes reflected in the archaeological data seem to
indicate that other small immigrations
along the same route took place in the
sixteenth and eighteenth centuries. These
and earlier immigrants, all coming from the
south, seem to have reached Scoresby Sund
and perhaps even farther north. While we
may conclude that Ammassalik was largely
populated by immigrants from the south,
it is certain that some Eskimo did reach
the eastern coast via the north.

Although lacking direct archaeological
proof, we may posit that Dorset culture
(around 400 A.D.) was present in Ammassalik. It is difficult to determine whether
or not there has been continuity from
these ancient Arctic hunters to the present, but it seems that Dorset traditions
have lived on since the first centuries of
the Christian era on the eastern coast.

At present, no relation can be established between the musk-oxen hunters of
Northern Greenland two- to four-thousand
years ago and the coastal Eskimo whose
presence was attested much later.

TWENTIETH CENTURY

Since the time of discovery, the detailed demographic history of the population of Eastern Greenland is known
through Danish religious and civil registration records and through the reconstruction and analysis done by R. Gessain
(1969), J. Robert (1970, 1971), and
P. Robbe.

The salient facts for our study of Ammassalik and Scoresby Sund are the following: (1) The Scoresby Sund District
was established in 1925 and was comprised
of 70 individuals. (2) There was a striking
increase in the Eastern Greenland population of some five-hundred per cent (see
Figure 1) due to the extraordinarily efficient medical care provided by the Danes.
(3) The population experienced an admixDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

ture of West Greenlandic genes at the start
and later of European genes. Some 2 to 3
per cent of the population, mainly children, are of mixed blood at the present
time. (4) Birth control measures have
been introduced in the last few years.
Their effect has not yet been measured,
except in Scoresby Sund. (5) Until now,
first-cousin marriages have been prohibited
by tradition.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Utilizing the available data, we have
calculated for different time periods the
effective population size, systematic pressure, and migration matrix.

PREHISTORIC PAST

For the prehistoric period, we estimated
effective population sizes on the basis of
the Ammassalik population size of 413 at
the time of discovery in 1884. Since there
were at that time 182 individuals of re
 

productive age, we have taken 200 as our
effective population size since we know
that some people had died or left shortly
before the census. We will also consider
two extreme estimates of effective population size, 130 and 300. The first figure
corresponds to the one-third of the census
population normally used as effective population size. However, we know this figure
to be an underestimate as there was a
lowered proportion of old people in the
population due to the custom of the elderly
committing suicide when they were no
longer able to follow the community. The
second number was chosen because it
seemed the maximum figure compatible
with the ecology at that time.

Since only one population is being considered, the migration matrix is 1. The systematic pressure is difficult to determine
with any accuracy. We have calculated
values corresponding roughly to 2, 4, and
10 immigrants per generation, the last
figure certainly being much too high.

Vol. 21, No. 3 Migration and Kinship in Eastern Greenland

HISTORICAL PERIOD

The evolution of the effective population
sizes is shown in Figure 1 for both Ammassalik and Scoresby Sund. It has been taken
as equal to the number of married people
able to reproduce. The migration matrix
has been taken as equal to 1 before the
creation of Scoresby Sund, then equal to
the average migration matrix for both
settlements during the historical period.
The systematic pressure has been taken
to equal the mean long-range migration
rate per generation. For the living population, we counted one for the West Greenland settlers, one-half for people having
one parent born outside of Eastern Greenland, and one-fourth for those having one
grandparent born outside. Averaging the
values for one generation, we took 0.02
(partly ascertained) for Ammassalik and
0.105 (calculated) for Scoresby Sund. In
part one of the simulation, trials with three
different values for the initial kinship measured by Malecot’s @ were performed.
These values are 0.035, which is considered likely, and 0.02 and 0.04, both of
which seem extreme.

THE FUTURE

Since no official decision about a population policy for Eastern Greenland has yet
been made, it is possible that there will
be a continuing expansion of the population as in the sixties. However, this possibility seems unlikely considering the economic
situation, the direction of governmental
population policies, and the introduction of
birth control in the last few years.

It is more likely that local population
sizes will be regulated by emigration and
birth control, particularly in the Ammassalik population. Such regulation would
presumably result in a constant, economically self-supporting population on the
eastern coast of Greenland. Curiously

 

275

enough, certain considerations lead us to
believe that the size of this optimum population would lie in the same range as the
size of the prehistoric Eskimo population.

For our study, we hypothesized that the
effective population size would increase exponentially until 1984, when those people
born after the introduction of contraception will begin to marry and reproduce.
Later, the effective population sizes would
be reduced in one generation to the ascertained optimum of 175 in Ammassalik and
35 in Scoresby Sund. We have assumed
that the migration rates and systematic
pressures would remain constant. The arbitrariness of these hypotheses is expressed
by the parentheses in the tables and the
dotted line in Figure 1,

METHOD

We used the NUMIX and OBELIX
computer programs (D. Harris, 1969)
which perform a deterministic simulation
of the evolution of genetic kinship using
the following parameters: the initial kinship matrix; the vectors of effective population sizes in the successive generations;
the vector of linearized systematic pressures; and the migration matrix.

The NUMIX program computes the
evolution of kinship between two finite
populations z and # of effective population
sizes N; and N; in a set of m populations.

At the first generation (¢ = 1),

The OBELIX computer program performs the same simulation as NUMIX but
allows different systematic pressures in the
n populations.

The systematic pressures and migration
matrix are supposed constant in the program available now. This hypothesis is, of
course, hazardous, but since the populations are small these parameters are random variables whose fluctuations may be
meaningless. The generation » of convergence of the @ is defined by:

| Qn+1 — Dn | < 10-8,

RESULTS
PREHISTORIC PAST
The place of origin of Ammassalik and
Scoresby Sund people derived from the
genealogies of the present population is
given in Table 1.

Table 2 leads us to think that the initial
kinship in Ammassalik should “lie"betwéen
0.02 and 0.04, the most likely values being
around 0.032-0.035. The values of 0.016
and 0.05 were obtained by using estimates
that are barely defensible according to what
we know of actual conditions at the time
of discovery. The values in parentheses can
virtually be discounted since they correspond to a number of generations much
higher than possibly ever lived in the area.

HISTORICAL PAST AND THE FUTURE

Results are given in Table 3, corresponding respectively to the three hypotheses
0.02, 0.035 and 0.04 about initial kinship.

The most striking fact seems to be that,
as the population increases, opposite effects on the effective population sizes and
on the migration rates tend to stabilize
the level of kinship, even in a period of
exponential growth as between 1884 and
1970 in Ammassalik.

The situation is somewhat different at
the origin of Scoresby Sund where the
initial population was very small, but the
joint higher systematic pressure and population increase seems to have held down
the rising of the kinship coefficient.

It can also be seen that the long-term
effect of a birth control policy would be to
stabilize the kinship coefficients close to
their present level rather than to disturb
significantly their values.

Kinship between both settlements decreases slowly (about one-third in four
generations) before reaching a migration
equilibrium.

The equilibrium values and number of
generations before convergence have no
meaning as predictions, but constitute a
good description of the genetic significance
of the present demographic data.

isolation of small human populations could
