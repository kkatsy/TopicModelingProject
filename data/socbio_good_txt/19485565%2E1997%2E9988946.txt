ABSTRACT: In this paper we examine the effects of socioeconomic development, the status of
women, and family planning on fertility and the extent to which these effects vary among the
nineteen districts of Bangladesh. The 1983 and 1991 Bangladesh Contraceptive Prevalence Survey data are used to examine the effects of these factors on differences in contraceptive use
among currently married women aged 15-49. The proportion of currently married women aged
15-49 using contraception was 46.3 per cent in 1991, a considerable increase from 26.5 per cent
in 1983. Contraceptive use rates for all the districts increased substantially over the period between 1983 and 1991 and the gap between Dhaka’s rate and those of other districts was narrower in 1991 than in 1983. An analytical model composed of socioeconomic development, sta
_ tus of women, and family planning variables is tested using logistic regression. The logit model is

used to evaluate the effects of a selected group of variables on the probability of using contraceptive methods. The analysis demonstrates clearly that socioeconomic development and women’s
status significantly impact the use of contraceptive methods in Bangladesh. The results also suggest that better-educated, employed women are more likely to use contraception than those who
have little or no formal education and who are not employed. In 1983, rural-urban differences in
contraceptive use were significant, but in 1991 area of residence was not significant, which suggests that family planning programs may have played an important role in providing contraceptive information and technology to rural areas. Our analysis also suggests that family planning
programs operated more efficiently in some districts than in others, and regional differences remained important in 1991 as they were in 1983. Decomposition analysis suggests that shifts in
population structure favored increased contraceptive use in Bangladesh. This analysis also indicates that change in rate is also important, contributing about 21 per cent of the overall increase
in contraceptive use.

 

 

The contemporary debate concerning
the interrelationships among fertility,
development, and family planning programs reaches back to the eighteenth century (Demeny, 1979; Mauldin and Berelson, 1978; Freedman and Berelson, 1978;
Tsui and Bogue, 1978). More recently,
demographers have debated about the importance of these programs in contributing to fertility declines in relation to other
factors, especially improvements in educational and economic opportunities (e.g.,
Barr, 1992; Freedman and Freedman,

1992; Ross and Lloyd, 1992; Khuda et
al., 1990; Bulatao and Lee, 1983).

One position is that the mere availability of family planning programs
causes fertility decline independent of cultural, political, or socioeconomic influences (Freedman and Freedman, 1992;
Mauldin and Berelson, 1978; Ross and
Lloyd, 1992). Other scholars maintain
that development will bring about a natural decline in fertility that is presumably
independent of programs to promote contraception (Simmons, 1979; Easterlin, 1978).

Many observers have also suggested that
an increase in the acceptance of family
planning and reductions in fertility can be
brought about more rapidly if population
programs are integrated into development projects at the community or area
level (Kocher, 1984). Because integrated
population-development programs at the
community level may enhance employment and income opportunities—particularly for women—and because they provide direct access to social and family
welfare services, they are believed to create eventually an environment conducive
to changing contraceptive and reproductive behavior to be consistent with national
population objectives (Oberai, 1992).

Socioeconomic development provides
a social context within which the functions of the family are reduced, the value
of children is decreased, and the cost of
children is increased. Thus, socioeconomic development helps to reduce desired family size. In this paper, we contribute to this debate by investigating the
effects of socioeconomic development,
the status of women, and family planning
on fertility and the extent to which these
effects vary among the districts of Bangladesh.

In recent years there has been a sustained interest among demographers in
the West about the population of Bangladesh. This interest stems from at least
three factors. First, Bangladesh, with a
current population of 116 million, is
densely settled and represents the eighth
most populous country in the world. Second, in recent years the practice of family
planning in Bangladesh has increased
substantially. Results from the 1991 Contraceptive Prevalence Survey show that
the proportion of currently married

- women under age 50 using contraception

Social Biology

was 46.3 per cent, a substantial increase
from 26.5 per cent in 1983. Third, the
country has experienced a pronounced
and rapid decline in fertility. Data from
the Bangladesh Contraceptive Prevalence
Survey (CPS) and from Bangladesh Fertility Surveys (BFS) show that fertility
has declined substantially in the past 25
years, with women now having around
4.6 live births over their reproductive life
spans as opposed to about 7 during the
1960’s.

Analyses of this decline have suggested that family planning programs
have played a major role in the decline
(DeGraff, 1991; Ahmed, 1987; Bhatia,
1983). Hoque (1988) found that contextual variables may also play a role in reducing fertility. In his study, contextual
variables (i.e., the availability of health
and family planning services within or
near a village, the availability of education facilities within or near a village, and
accessibility to communication centers)
were positively and significantly related
to family planning practices and negatively and significantly related to ideal
family size in both electrified and nonelectrified villages in rural Bangladesh.

This paper endeavors to expand the
discussion of the relationships between
socioeconomic development, women’s
status, family planning, and fertility in
two regards. First, nearly all previous
studies of Bangladesh fertility patterns
have concentrated on the country as a
whole or on a single subregion (for example, Matlab Thana). As a result, the
potential effects of regional differences
have not been adequately examined. Second, although Bangladesh Contraceptive
Prevalence Survey data have been available since 1981, no previous study was
found that examined trends in contracep

tive use in Bangladesh over time. Previous studies have been based on crosssectional national survey data (Ahmed,
1987; DeGraff, 1991; Hoque, 1988). This
paper is thus unique because it represents
the first attempt to examine trends in contraceptive use in Bangladesh at the district level. This examination is particularly important because the data cover a
period of substantial social and economic
change in the country. During this period,
Bangladesh made substantial progress in
educational attainment and in the reduction of infant mortality rates. Women’s
participation in the labor force and age at
first marriage also increased considerably
during this period.

This paper pursues two forms of analysis. We first examine trends in fertility and
contraceptive use in Bangladesh between
1983 and 1991 at both the national and regional levels. Second, we examine the impact of socioeconomic development, the
status of women, and family planning
programs on contraceptive use and the extent to which these effects vary among the
districts of Bangladesh. In the process we
seek to ascertain whether shifts in population composition could account for the
observed increase in contraceptive use in
Bangladesh. Decomposition procedures
are used to delineate factors that may have
contributed to the observed change.

Analyses of regional patterns in Bangladesh are important for several reasons.
We believe that considering the nation as a
composite of highly divergent regions is a
particularly advantageous way to investigate fertility differentials in Bangladesh. Although one might imagine that Bangladesh
is a homogenous country and that there is
little regional variation in socioeconomic
conditions because Bangladesh is predominantly rural and economically dependent on

Fertility in Bangladesh 181

agriculture, there is nonetheless considerable variability among the regions in levels
of socioeconomic development and in family planning program development (Haque,
1992). According to the 1981 Population
Census of Bangladesh, the Dhaka district
had the highest proportion of urban population followed by the Chittagong district,
while the Faridpur district had the lowest
proportion of urban population—38.5,
31.1, and 6.9 per cent respectively. The
density of population ranged from a low of
147 persons per square mile in the district
of Rangamati to a high of 3,477 persons in
the district of Dhaka. Rangamati had the
highest proportion of Buddhist population,
with 55.0 per cent. The highest proportions
of Hindu populations were in the districts
of Dinajpur, Faridpur, Sylhet, and Barisal—21.9, 18.8, 18.0, and 15.1 per cent, respectively. School enrollment ranged from
a low of 11.1 per cent in the district of
Rangamati to a high of 30.2 per cent in the
district of Patuakhali (Bangladesh Bureau
of Statistics 1984). Family planning practice rates in 1983 ranged from a low of 13
per cent in the Pabna district to a high of
47 per cent in the Tangail district. There
is thus substantial variability among parts
of Bangladesh that may impact fertility
change (see Table 1).

fertility, contraception, child survival, and
selected sociodemographic characteristics
for large, nationally representative samples
of 15,916 women in 1983 and 12,050
women in 1991 from the nineteen districts
of Bangladesh. Both surveys used the same
type of questions on contraceptive use and
employed the same methodology using female interviewers to administer questionnaires in local languages. Since our analysis
focused on contraceptive use, women who
were not in need of contraception at the time
of the survey were excluded from our analysis. Our analysis focuses on currently married nonpregnant women who are 15-49
years of age because they are the women
most likely at risk of getting pregnant.

EMPIRICAL MODEL

The empirical model uses a logit equation to evaluate the effect of a select
group of variables on the probability of us
ing modern contraceptive methods. The
logit model is appropriate because the dependent variable is dichotomous (Demaris,
1992). The logistic regression model for
the log odds of contraceptive use is

Ln [P/U —P;)] = By + BX; +...+B,X,
where Ln [P./(1—P,)] is simply the conditional odds of using a contraceptive method,
given the explanatory variables (x; ).

Two multivariate logit models are used
for this analysis, one for each period. We
examine the results for differences across
areas in terms of the significance of coefficients, as well as in terms of the direction
and magnitude of the effects of selected
variables. Decomposition procedures are
also used to delineate factors that may
have contributed to the observed change.
Regression decomposition techniques are

tive use into its constituent parts (i.e., composition, rates, and interaction components). This technique is similar to ones
developed by Clogg and Eliason (1986),
Coombs and Sun (1981), and Iams and
Thornton (1975). The equation for the
1983 period is

Ln [PJ —P)]¢g3) = Borg) + B;Xig3) + - - + BX n(83)

and the equation for the 1991 period is

Ln [P/A~—P oy = Bory + Bio + - + + BXn(91):

The result obtained by Ln [P/—P2)]¢g3)

by using the following equation:

where

Logit(g3) = Ln [P;/(1—P;)] in 1983,

Logit) = Ln [P,/(1—P,)] in 1991,

Pg3) = the proportion in the jth category
of the th explanatory variable in 1983,

P91) = the proportion in the jh category
of the th explanatory variable in 1991,

Bocg3y = the regression constant for 1983,

Bocory = the regression constant for 1991,

B;(g3) = the coefficient for the jh category
of the th explanatory variable for 1983,
and

Bio1) = the coefficient for the th category
of the th explanatory variable for 1991.

This procedure results in four components: (1) the intercept component, which
reflects the difference in the intercepts of
the equations for the two time periods;

 

 

Fertility in Bangladesh 183

(2) the rates or coefficient component,
which indicates the differences between
the slopes; (3) the composition component, which indicates the part of the overall differences produced by the independent variables; and (4) the interaction
component, which is the covariation or
collinearity between the means and the
coefficients for the two time periods. This
last component can be interpreted as the
effect of changing both means and regression coefficients together versus the effects of changing them one at a time
(Iams and Thornton, 1975).

EXPLANATORY VARIABLES

The dependent variable in this analysis
is current use of modern methods of contraception, coded 1 for current use and 0
otherwise. We focus on modern methods of
contraception because they account for
most of the contraceptive use in Bangladesh, and modern methods are more effective than traditional methods. In 1983 only
5.0 per cent of women were using traditional methods, whereas 21.5 per cent of
women were using modern methods. In
1991, 8.3 per cent of women were using
traditional methods compared with 37.9
per cent of women who were using modem
methods. To trace contraceptive use trends,
we include several independent variables to
control for factors that are frequently incorporated in models of fertility behavior in
Bangladesh and elsewhere (United Nations,
1987). Independent variables are grouped
into three categories: socioeconomic development variables, women’s status variables, and the family planning variables
that have been shown in earlier studies to
be influential in accounting for fertility
decline and increases in contraceptive
use. Other variables also affect contraceptive use and may have contributed to

184

change over time, but they have been excluded from the analysis, either because
they were not adequately measured or
they were not included in the data sets.
For example, this study excludes variables describing the expansion of family
planning services because communitylevel data on availability and/or accessibility of these services were not obtained
in both surveys.

The importance of women’s education
as a variable influencing fertility behavior
has been documented in several studies
both in developed and developing countries (Bellew et al., 1992; Greenspan,
1992; Gomes, 1984; Cochrane, 1979). Education is expected to influence women’s
access to modern knowledge and their desires for new ways of life, and hence the
extent to which they are familiar with and
approve of contraception, know how to
acquire and correctly use contraceptive
methods, and are able to engage in new
forms of behavior such as contraception.
In addition, women’s education tends to
break down barriers to communication
between spouses regarding contraception.
As a result of the diminished costs associated with fertility regulation, as well as
the motivation arising from their potentially higher supply of and lower demand
for children, better-educated women are
more likely to practice contraception.

The evidence available from developing countries indicates that the fertilityenhancing effects of education are strong
in societies that are in the early stages of
fertility transition but that, as the process
continues, these effects are gradually
overtaken by the fertility-reducing effects
characteristic of modern societies. For example, an analysis of the relationship between education and fertility in over 30
developing countries concluded that the

Hoque and Murdock

Social Biology

more developed of these countries often
reveal a negative association, whereas the
less developed countries were likely to
exhibit a curvlinear or positive association (United Nations, 1987). In the present study, respondent’s education is a categorical variable indicating whether she
has no formal education, primary education (one to five years), secondary education (six to ten years), or a college or university level of education (eleven years or
more).

Increased labor force participation of
women has been proposed repeatedly in
both the demographic literature and population policy statements as a means of promoting development and reducing fertility
in developing countries (Miah and Mizan,
1991; United Nations, 1985). It has been
argued that women who work may be
more independent and enjoy a more egalitarian marital relationship, which allows
them to exercise more control over fertility
decisions (Oppong, 1983). In addition,
some evidence indicates that with increasing education and the greater participation
of women in the labor force, domestic labor becomes more equally divided between husband and wife. Although women
still perform the majority of domestic labor, this change may precipitate a shift
among men to lower desired family sizes.
Fertility may also be related to the timing
of work. Women who work prior to marriage may marry later than women with no
premarital work experience. They may
also develop greater work commitment
and motivation to work, thereby raising
the opportunity costs of having children
during marriage.

Substantial empirical work has been
carried out which examines the relationship between women’s employment and
fertility in developing countries. The asDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

Vol. 44, No. 3—4

sertion that women’s employment is negatively related to fertility receives support
from most empirical studies. Nevertheless, the claim that work is causally related to fertility has, as yet, been inadequately examined for Bangladesh. In this
analysis, a woman’s employment status is
a categorical variable indicating whether
or not she is working outside the home
for money.

Region of residence has received increasing attention as a macrostructural
factor affecting contraceptive use in many
developing countries (Haque, 1992; Poston and Gu, 1987). Studies with this emphasis propose two major explanations
for regional differentials in contraceptive
use. The socioeconomic hypothesis suggests that regions whose women have low
education, limited formal-sector employment, and limited access to health and
family outlets may be expected to have
low rates of contraceptive use. A second
explanation for the importance of region
of residence may be as a proxy for ethnic
and cultural boundaries that are related to
acceptance of contraceptive methods. The
important mechanisms through which
ethnicity may affect the use of modern
contraceptives are norms and customs affecting age at marriage, type of marital
unions, postpartum abstinence, breastfeeding, and resilience in the face of innovation (Lesthaeghe, 1989; Murty and
De Vos, 1984). Regions of residence in
this study are coded into nineteen categories representing the administrative districts that were covered by both surveys.

Studies of the relationship between
contraceptive use and child mortality
yield contradictory findings. Most studies
suggest that couples who have experienced the death of one or more children
are less likely to use a contraceptive

Fertility in Bangladesh 185

method than those who have not; yet Van
de Walle and Knodel (1980) argue that the
prior death of a child may be a sign of
an unmet need for contraception. In their
opinion, deaths of children may often
be caused by intentional neglect because
the births were unwanted. Consequently,
women who have previously experienced
the death of a child may be more highly
motivated to practice contraception than
those without. Child loss in this study is
coded as a dummy variable indicating
whether or not the mother has lost a child.

Rural-urban differences are among the
most widely studied socioeconomic differentials in individual fertility (United
Nations, 1987). Empirical studies have
yielded various results concerning the
pattern and magnitude of rural-urban fertility differences. Rural fertility has consistently been found to be higher than urban fertility in European and developed
countries. Results for developing countries have not been as consistent. In Latin
American and Caribbean countries, a pattern similar to that of developed countries
has been observed, where urban fertility
is lower than rural fertility (United Nations, 1987). In Africa and Asia, however,
several patterns have been observed. In
some countries, higher rural fertility has
been reported; in other countries, there
has been higher urban fertility. In still
other countries, no significant differences
by place of residence have been reported.
However, urbanization in many developing countries has often been associated
with higher levels of education, better access to medical care and family planning
services, and other social services. Consequently, rates of contraceptive use are
expected to be higher in urban than in
rural areas.

RESULTS

Table 2 presents the proportions of
currently married, nonpregnant women using contraceptives in Bangladesh in 1983
and in 1991. Several patterns emerge
from data in this table. First, the proportion of Bangladeshi women using a contraceptive method increased dramatically
during in the period between the 1983
and 1991 Contraceptive Surveys. In 1983,
26.5 per cent of women were using a
modern contraceptive method, but by
1991, the figure had increased to 46.3
per cent. A second pattern is that every
subgroup (except college/university educated women) showed some gains in
the use of contraceptives, although the
amount of change differed greatly among
groups. Furthermore, areas that had the
lowest use rates in 1983 (such as residents of Rajshahi, Pabna, Rangpur, and
Bogra) made the most significant gains in
use over the period. Third, there were
subgroup differences at each survey
period, but these differences declined
sharply from 1983 to 1991. The 1983 survey data show clear differentials in contraceptive use for many of the variables
considered for analysis, especially education, urbanization, child loss, and district
of residence. By 1991, however, contraceptive use had increased in all strata except among more highly educated women
where use rates were already high by
1983.

Table 3 suggests that the composition
of the population changed in ways that
may have contributed to increased contraceptive use in Bangladesh. For example,
the percentage of women employed in the
labor force increased from 9.5 per cent to
26.4 per cent in the eight-year period. A
significant increase in educational attain
Hoque and Murdock

Social Biology

ment also occurred; the proportion of
women with no formal education declined from 66.4 per cent in 1983 to 57.8
per cent in 1991. The proportion of
women with secondary levels of education increased from 9.3 per cent in 1983
to 13.4 per cent in 1991. The age composition also shifted between the two periods. The number of women in the 15-19
year old age group decreased from 18.1
per cent to 13 per cent. This change may
have been due to an increase in the
women’s age at first marriage since the
Contraceptive Prevalence Survey selected
only married women who were 15-49
years of age. The proportion of women
who experienced the death of a child declined from 92 per cent in 1983 to 40 per
cent in 1991. This dramatic decrease in
the number of women who did not experience the death of a child is quite interesting. One possible explanation for this
extraordinary decrease is that we are observing the effects of intense immunization efforts and prenatal care over the
years. Infant mortality rates in Bangladesh dropped from 148 per 1,000
women in 1984 (Population Reference
Bureau 1984) to 91 per 1,000 women in
1994 (World Bank 1994). Another explanation for this phenomenon would be that
there are two different samples. The proportion of women who wanted more children declined from 43.7 per cent in 1983
to 39.7 per cent in 1991 while the proportion of women who wanted no additional
children increased from 52.5 per cent in
1983 to 59.5 per cent in 1991.

contraceptive use among currently married nonpregnant women in Bangladesh

the regressions on contraceptive use for
1983 and Columns 3 and 4 show the coefficients and standard errors for the regressions on contraceptive use for 1991.
By comparing the coefficients for different periods we can determine whether the
effects of each variable on contraceptive
use changed between the two periods and
whether this change is significant.

The results show that the variables selected for the analysis are generally important predictors of contraceptive use.
Overall, age has significant net negative
effects in 1983 and net positive effects
under age 45 in 1991, which suggests that
high parity women are less likely to use

contraception. The effects of education
on contraceptive use are those which one
would expect from previous research.
Large, statistically significant differences
in contraceptive use by educational level
were observed despite controls for other
variables both in 1983 and in 1991.
Women with the highest levels of education (college/university degree) were
three times more likely to use contraceptives than those who had no education.
Logit analysis confirms the expectation that employed women are more
likely to use modern contraceptive methods than those who are not employed.
The coefficient is statistically significant,

and the odds are almost two to one both
in 1983 and in 1991.

Having experienced the death of a
child was also a significant predictor of
contraceptive use in 1983. At that time,
among the mothers who had experienced
the death of at least one child, contraceptive use rates were less than half the rates
of those who had not experienced a child
loss. In 1991, the difference was insignificant, and the odds were less than one.

The positive relationship between desire for no more children and contraceptive use is strong and consistent. Even
when other variables are held constant,
desire for no more children has signifi
cant effects on the decision to use a contraceptive method; the odds of contraceptive use among the women who desire no
more children are four times greater than
among those who want more children.

Religion is an important determinant of
contraceptive use in Bangladesh. The coefficient was positive and significant in
both 1983 and 1991—-suggesting that nonMuslim women were more likely to practice contraception than Muslim women.

In 1983, contraceptive use was higher
in urban areas than in rural areas, with urban women being two times more likely
to use contraception than rural women. In
1991 the difference was not statistically

significant. This suggests that family
planning programs may have played an
important role in increasing contraceptive
use in rural areas.

Place of defecation was a significant
predictor of contraceptive use in Bangladesh. Those who use a flush toilet were
twice as likely to use contraceptive meth
ods than those who did not have a flush
toilet. The variable can be seen as an indicator of modernization of the place or
socioeconomic development.

Visits to a hospital or health center
were also significant in explaining contraceptive use among Bangladeshi women.

center were two times more likely to use
a contraceptive method than those who
did not visit such a facility.

In 1983, visits from a family planning
worker were not significantly related to
the use of contraception. But in 1991,
such visits were an important determinant
of contraceptive use in Bangladesh.

With regard to place of residence,
Table 4 shows that the gaps between
Dhaka (reference district) and other districts were narrower in 1991 than in
1983. The most notable changes occurred
in the Khulna, Kushtia, Jessore, Rajshahi,
Pabna, Dinajpur, and Bogra districts, districts where the coefficients for contraceptive use were negative and nonsignificant
in 1983 and became positive and significant in 1991. Contraceptive use rates increased considerably over the period between 1983 and 1991 for other districts
(see Table 2), but contraceptive use rates
were still lower than in Dhaka. Thus, the
coefficients for these areas are negative
and significant. Therefore, the Bangladesh
government’s efforts to make family planning services more accessible to all the
districts of the country may have operated
more efficiently in some districts than in
others and regional differences remained
important in 1991 as in 1983.

DECOMPOSITION OF CONTRACEPTIVE
USE, 1983 AND I9QQI

The above analysis highlights changes
that may have contributed to increases in
contraceptive use in Bangladesh, but does
not explain whether this change is due to
change in rates of contraceptive use or
change in population composition in
1991. Thus, to assess the relative importance of rate effects and composition effects, we provide the results of the decomposition analysis in Table 5. The

Fertility in Bangladesh 193

composition effect measures change resulting from population composition, assuming no changes in specific rates. The
rate effect measures change in specific
rates assuming no change in population
composition. The interaction effect involves changes resulting from both composition and specific rates. A comprehensive discussion of the rationale for and
the mathematical formulation has been
presented by Kitagawa (1955). Others
who have contributed to the development
of decomposition methods include Das
Gupta (1978), Clogg and Eliason (1986),
and Kim and Strobino (1984). From
Table 5 one can see that the major component of the increase in contraceptive
use, explaining 30 per cent of the change,
is change in population composition.
Change in rate is also important, contributing about 21 per cent of the overall
increase in contraceptive use. Fourteen
per cent of the change in contraceptive
use is due to interaction effects.
Decomposition analysis also suggests
that shifts in population structure favored
increased contraceptive use in Bangladesh.
Fifty-four per cent of the increase in compositional change in contraceptive use was
due to increases in the proportion of
women who did not experience a child
loss. The proportion of women who wished
to cease childbearing was also important in
explaining compositional change in the
population. The dramatic increase in the
number of women who did not experience
child loss explained almost 18 per cent
(54.16/(105.54+91.86+63.97+47.26)) of
the absolute change in contraceptive use in
Bangladesh. The proportion of women who
wish to cease childbearing explained 5 per
cent (15.43/ (105.54+ 91.86+ 63.97+ 42.26))
of the absolute change in contraceptive
use. Education and employment explained

6 per cent of the absolute change in increased use of contraceptives in Bangladesh.

The importance of district of residence
is evident when the rates or coefficient effects are examined. District of residence
explained almost 10 per cent of the absolute change in rates in contraceptive
use in Bangladesh. Age was also important, explaining 17.7 per cent of the absolute change in rates of contraceptive
use. Finally, these data reveal that the mix
of “rate” and “composition” effects varies
significantly across explanatory variables.
For example, district of residence did not

have explanatory power for composi-—

tional effects while it had major significant explanatory power for rate effects.
This finding suggests that family planning programs played an important role
in increasing contraceptive practice rates
across the country. We also examined a
model excluding district of residence.
The results of the decomposition analysis
show that significant power for rate ef
 

fects is lost when district of residence is
dropped from the regression model. For
example, the proportion of change due to
the rate effect decreased from 21.07 per
cent to 12.8 per cent, while the proportion
of change due to composition increased
from about 30 per cent to 35 per cent (see
the lower part of Table 5). Change in the
intercept was also larger than the previous model indicating that this regression
equation contains a larger unexplained
component than the one presented earlier
in this paper.

Table 5 also reveals that 35 per cent of
the change in contraceptive use is due to
change in the intercept. This finding can
be interpreted as change in the rates for
variables not considered in the model. Although many factors that may determine
contraceptive use could not be included
in the study, a major set of elements may
consist of socioeconomic factors and the
availability of family planning services in
the community. Previous studies show
that the availability of family planning

services has significantly affected contraceptive use in Bangladesh. Income may
be another variable which is significantly
related to contraceptive use. The analysis
of such effects will require further work.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

This paper examined the trends and
determinants in contraceptive use in Bangladesh at the district level between 1983
and 1991. We used data from the 1983
and the 1991 Bangladesh Contraceptive
Survey. To our knowledge, no previous
study has examined trends in contraceptive use in Bangladesh at the district
level. Our findings suggest that socioeconomic development, the status of women
and availability of family planning played
important roles in the increased use of
contraceptives in Bangladesh. All of these
variables were significantly related to
contraceptive use in Bangladesh.

A substantial increase in contraceptive
use occurred in Bangladesh between
1983 and 1991. In 1983, 26.5 per cent
of women were using a contraceptive
method, but by 1991 the figure increased
to 46.3 per cent. This increase was shared
by all groups investigated in this study,
but the amount of change differed greatly
among groups. Better educated, employed
women were more likely to use a contraceptive method in both periods. This
study suggests that contraception was
adopted initially by younger women;
however, by 1991 the differential between
age groups had narrowed considerably. In
1983 rural-urban differences in contraceptive use were significant, and urban
women were two times more likely to use
contraception than rural women, but in
1991 this difference was not significant.
This finding suggests that family planning

Fertility in Bangladesh 195

programs have been quite successful in
rural areas. Visits to a hospital or health
center were significant in explaining contraceptive use in Bangladesh, as well. Visits from a family planning worker also
played an important role in increasing
contraceptive use in Bangladesh.

Our analysis demonstrates that contraceptive practice rates in Bangladesh vary
among the districts. Family planning
practice rates in 1983 ranged from a low
of 13 per cent in the Pabna district to a
high of 47 per cent in the Tangail district.
Contraceptive use rates for all the districts increased considerably over the period between 1983 and 1991, and the gap
between the districts was narrower in
1991 than in 1983. However, family planning practice rates in 1991 varied from a
low of 30 per cent to a high of 85 per
cent. The relative change in family planning practice varied from a low of 14 per
cent in the Comilla district to a high of
260 per cent in the Pabna district. This
finding suggests that family planning programs operated more efficiently in some
districts than in others, and regional differences remained important in 1991 as
in 1983.

This study also decomposed the increase in contraceptive use during the
decade. The decomposition revealed that
shifts in population composition—toward
an increase in the proportion of women
who did not experience a child loss and
also in the proportion of women who want
to cease childbearing—were the primary
sources of aggregate change in contraceptive use in Bangladesh. Changes in rates
were also important, particularly in the
district of residence. Change in the intercept suggests that the most important rate
change occurred for variables that are excluded from the compositional analysis.

This finding suggests that family planning variables and contextual variables
may have been some of the unexplained
components.

Overall, the results of this analysis
suggest that policy-based programs may
substantially impact contraceptive use
and, through such use, fertility levels, but
that regional levels of variation in socioeconomic development may hinder the
full adoption of such programs. Thus, the
findings showing the effects of reduced
levels of child loss and a desire for fewer
children on contraceptive use clearly
suggest that health- and contraceptionrelated government programs may have
impacted contraceptive use. In addition,
the fact that contraceptive use changed
substantially in virtually all districts in
Bangladesh shows that change in the use
of contraceptives has been pervasive.
Such results suggest that policy-related
changes may impact contraceptive use.

At the same time, the existence of continuing regional effects suggests that the
primary differences between regions,
which mainly appear to be their levels of
socioeconomic development, are factors
affecting contraceptive use. Very limited
levels of socioeconomic development

may inhibit even extensive policy-related
changes to promote contraceptive use.

In regard to the continuing debate
about the relative importance of development and family planning factors in fertility decline, the results here tend to support the importance of program-related
changes, with socioeconomic development largely playing a mediating role in
moderating or inhibiting the impacts of
change. Clearly, analyses involving more
direct family planning variables and
village-level development variables may
be necessary to further reveal these relative effects. Nevertheless, the case of Bangladesh makes evident the fact that rapid
increases in contraceptive use may be obtained if programs to increase child
health and welfare are improved and contraception is readily available.
