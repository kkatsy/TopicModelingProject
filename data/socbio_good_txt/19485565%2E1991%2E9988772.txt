ABSTRACT: Seasonal fluctuations in births have been observed in virtually all human
populations. In this paper we re-examine the seasonality of births with two main objectives in
mind. The first is to provide an overview of the basic facts about the seasonality of births,
presenting new estimates of the seasonal patterns. Seasonality is an important if not dominant
source of nontrend variation in births in virtually all populations, but there are dramatic and
puzzling differences across countries and time periods in the pattern of seasonal variation
observed in particular populations. The second purpose of the paper is to survey the leading
hypotheses about birth seasonality that have appeared in the literature and to discuss the
consistency of these hypotheses with observed seasonal patterns. Using our estimates of
seasonal patterns along with other evidence in the literature, we conclude that no single

explanation receives strong, consistent support from the data.

Seasonal fluctuations in births have
been observed in virtually all human
populations, both contemporary and
historical. These fluctuations have attracted considerable attention from demographers and other social scientists,
and a variety of behavioral and biological mechanisms have been proposed to
explain them (see, e.g., Cowgill, 1965,
1966; Rosenberg, 1966; Parkes, 1968,
1976; Kevan, 1979; Dyson and Crook,
1981; and Roenneberg and Aschoff,
1989a). Despite a long history of research on the subject, however, there is
no generally accepted explanation for
the seasonality of births.

In this paper we re-examine the seasonality of births in human populations,
with two main objectives in mind. The
first is to provide an overview of the basic facts about the seasonality of births,
presenting new estimates of the seasonal
patterns. Existing literature provides estimates of birth seasonality for many
countries and time periods, but differing

methodologies and the frequent use of
small sample periods makes comparisons across populations difficult. We
present new estimates of the seasonal
patterns in births in order to document
the major regularities and unify existing
estimates. We do not, however, provide
an exhaustive set of results (Lam and
Miron, 1987). Instead, we illustrate the
basic stylized facts about the seasonality
of births.

The empirical section of the paper
produces two broad conclusions. First,
seasonality is an important if not dominant source of nontrend variation in
births in virtually all populations. Second, even though there is pronounced
seasonal variation in almost all populations, there are dramatic and puzzling
differences across countries and time
periods in the pattern of seasonal variations observed in particular populations. While it is true that certain patterns appear in many countries and
persist over periods as long as centuries,

there is no simple rule determining
which seasonal pattern in births a particular population exhibits.

The second purpose of the paper is to
survey the leading hypotheses about
birth seasonality that have appeared in
the literature and to discuss the consistency of these hypotheses with observed
seasonal patterns. Using our estimates
of seasonal patterns along with other evidence in the literature, we conclude
that no single explanation receives
strong, consistent support from the
data. Instead, the variation in seasonal
patterns across countries and time periods poses a challenge to virtually all existing explanations, without decisively
rejecting any of them. The seasonality
of births remains a major unresolved
puzzle in empirical demography, a puzzle that raises provocative questions for
both biological and behavioral research
on fertility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

ESTIMATING AND COMPARING
SEASONAL PATTERNS

In order to quantify the relative importance of seasonal fluctuations and to
consistently compare seasonal patterns
across populations, we use a methodology based on the seasonal dummy
definition of seasonality. This is a simple
and easily interpreted definition, and
our results can be readily compared with
the estimates provided in much previous
research. Alternative specifications of
seasonality, such as seasonal ARIMA
or spectral models, do not produce estimates of the timing and magnitude of
the seasonal peaks and troughs in births.
These patterns are the principal focus of
our study.

We assume that the data on births are
described by the following model:

B, = ST X; (1)

 

Social Biology

exp x ad} (2)

T; = exp (yt + 82 + 62° + ot‘) (3)

where B, is the number of births per day
in month ¢, S,is the seasonal component
of B,, T, is the trend component of B,, X;
is the nonseasonal, nontrend component of B,, dj is a seasonal dummy for
month s, and a, is the seasonal factor in
B, for months.
Equations (1)-(3) imply

12
In B; = > adi + yt + 8? + 62°

s=1

+ ot* + In X;. (4)

It follows from (4) that if a, is the coefficient on the sth seasonal dummy, then
B,is on average a, per cent higher in season s than it is on average during the
year as a whole.

To obtain estimates of the a,, we proceed in two steps. We first estimate the
equation

In B,= a + yt + 87 + 62° + bt* + bt (5)
by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). The
residual from this equation, b;, 1s a zero

mean, detrended series for the log of
births. We then estimate the equation

12
b, = S a,di + Vy

s=1

(6)

OLS estimates of the a, are consistent,
we use these as our estimates of the seasonal pattern in births.

In addition to presenting estimates of
the seasonal patterns, we summarize
these patterns in a number of ways. We
present the R? from the OLS estimation
of (6) as an estimate of the percentage of
the nontrend variation in births due to
seasonality, and we report the ampli

tude (maximum minus minimum) of the
twelve seasonal coefficients as a measure of the importance of the seasonal
fluctuations. Finally, we test the statistical significance of the seasonal patterns
that we estimate. Since the error term in
(6) is not necessarily serially uncorrelated, we employ the Newey and West
(1987) formulas for the standard errors
of the coefficient estimates. Our specification allows for a lag length of 12
months in the autocorrelation matrix,
and it insures positive definiteness of the
variance-covariance matrix by using the
damp factor suggested in Newey and
West (1987).

RESULTS

THE STYLIZED FACTS ABOUT THE
SEASONALITY OF BIRTHS

In this section we document the
quantitative importance of seasonal
fluctuations and present new estimates
of the seasonal patterns in births for a
sample of countries and time periods.
Our goal is to illustrate the key stylized
facts about birth seasonality rather than
to provide an exhaustive set of estimates. A more extensive set of empirical results can be found in Lam and
Miron (1987), which presents the seasonal patterns in over twenty-five countries, in many cases for long sample periods. Here we present only those
patterns that are necessary to make the
points that we discuss in the next section.

We limit the presentation to published vital statistics data, with the exception of the Wrigley-Schofield (1981)
parish reconstitution series for England,
included because of the exceptionally
long time period it covers. We also reStrict our analysis to data series long
enough to establish meaningful seasonal
patterns. Our typical series is at least

Seasonality of Births 53

twenty years long, and all are over ten
years long. There are many potential
sources of bias in monthly data on
births, so it is possible that the data
reflect something other than true seasonal fluctuations in births. Takahashi
(1964), for example, notes a serious reporting bias for Japan, and Anderson
and Silver (1988) provide a detailed
analysis of the effects of the Soviet birth
registration system on seasonality in Soviet birth series. We believe the data
used here are of high quality, but the potential for systematic reporting biases
must always be kept in mind in analysis
of monthly vital statistics data.

Is BIRTH SEASONALITY QUANTITATIVELY
IMPORTANT?

Seasonality in births would merit
only casual attention if the seasonal fluctuations were small in magnitude or if
the patterns were highly unstable over
time. As will be seen below, however,
seasonal fluctuations are quantitatively
large when compared to other temporal
variations in fertility, and the patterns
themselves are strongly persistent.

The most convincing evidence on
both of these points can be found in
graphs of the time series of monthly
births. In Figures 1 and 2 we present the
monthly data on births (adjusted for the
number of days in the month) for two
populations with relatively large seasonal fluctuations. Figure 1 shows the
monthly birth series for Georgia for the
period 1948-86, while Figure 2 shows
the series for Sweden for the period
1921-87. Inspection of the figures demonstrates first of all that seasonal fluctuations are large in magnitude relative
to longer term secular movements in fertility. For example, the typical May to
September change in births in Georgia is
at least as great as the difference between the average birth rate in the mid

1950’s, the peak of the baby boom, and
the mid-1970’s, the trough of the baby
bust. The figures also demonstrate that
the seasonal patterns are highly persistent; the basic timing of peaks and
troughs, as well as the approximate
magnitudes of the fluctuations, remain
essentially constant over long periods.
The actual timing of the monthly patterns in the two populations is difficult to
see in these figures but will be shown in
detail below.

Table 1 presents more extensive evidence on the quantitative significance of
seasonal fluctuations. The table shows,
for a large sample of populations, the
R*’s from regressions of detrended log
births on monthly dummies, as well as
the peak-to-trough amplitudes in the
seasonal patterns. The table also reports
the twelve estimated monthly coefficients for later reference. As shown in
the table, the R?’s regularly exceed 50
per cent and are as high as 80 per cent
even in recent periods in highly developed populations. The peak-to-trough
amplitudes in births reported in Table 1
are almost always greater than 10 per
cent and are as high as 30 per cent in a
number of modern, urban populations.
Tests of statistical significance (not reported in the tables) reject the null hypothesis of no seasonality at the 1 per
cent level in all cases. Thus, according to
any reasonable measure, seasonal fluctuations are a dominant source of variation in births.

GEOGRAPHICAL VARIATION IN BIRTH
SEASONALITY

The summary statistics in Table 1
document the fact that seasonal fluctuations in births are quantitatively important. We turn now to an examination of
the geographical variation in these seasonal patterns. The first characteristic
we establish is that there is no simple

 

Social Biology

rule determining the seasonal pattern
that occurs in a particular country, despite the presence of significant seasonal
fluctuations in every country.

We begin by considering the patterns
in white births in three states representing different geographic regions of the
United States, shown in Panel A of Figure 3. All of the states exhibit a September peak and an April-May trough, a
pattern well established in previous
studies of U.S. birth seasonality (Cowgill, 1966; Rosenberg, 1966; Macfarlane, 1970; Lyster, 1971; Seiver,
1985). The figure demonstrates a persistent regional difference in birth seasonality in the United States. The
April-May trough is noticeably more
pronounced in Georgia than in California and New York, and the overall magnitude of birth seasonality is larger in
Georgia. As documented in previous
studies of U.S. birth seasonality, the
Georgia pattern shown here is typical of
the southern United States. The R? statistics imply that seasonal fluctuations
explain around 40 per cent of the nontrend variation in births in the states
shown, with peak-to-trough amplitudes
ranging from 10 per cent to 25 per cent.

Panel B of Figure 3 shows the seasonal patterns in Canada and England.
The Canada and England patterns are
similar to the U.S. patterns in the presence of a September peak followed by a
reduction in births in October through
January. They differ from the U.S. pattern in the spring months, however, with
no evidence of the spring trough that is
so pronounced in the southern United
States. England exhibits a noticeable
March peak in births, with a peak-totrough amplitude of about 13 per cent in
the 1948-83 period.

The pattern exhibited by England is
similar to that of many continental European populations. Panels C and D of

Figure 3 present patterns for the northern European populations of Denmark,
Sweden, Netherlands, and West Germany for the post-World War II period.
The “European pattern” consists of a
global spring peak, a local September
peak, and a significant trough during the
late fall and early winter. In several of
these countries, the change from peak to
trough is as high as 30 per cent, with the
seasonal dummies explaining as much as
80 per cent of the nontrend variation in
births. The pattern seen here is markedly different from that in the United
States, particularly the spring peak in
Europe as opposed to the spring trough
in the United States. The patterns do
have the September peak in common, as
well as some similarity with respect to
the fall/winter.

Panels E and F of Figure 3 show patterns for the central and southern European countries of Luxembourg, France,
Spain, and Italy. These countries exhibit
less dramatic seasonality than the northerm European countries. A number of
features of the “European pattern”’ persist, however, including the local September peak and the October through
January trough.

Figure 4 shows seasonal patterns fora
number of populations outside of North
America and Europe. Panels A and B
show the seasonal pattern for five regions of India. Delhi and Punjab are the
most northern of the Indian states included here, with Delhi at roughly the
same latitude as Florida and Punjab at
roughly the same latitude as Georgia.
Maharashtra and West Bengal are further south, at roughly the same latitude
as central Mexico. Kerala is in the far
south, at latitudes corresponding to
Central America. The raw birth series
for Kerala and West Bengal show much
less regular seasonal patterns than do
the other three states, suggesting the

 

Social Biology

possibility of significant measurement
error. Since we do not have any specific
reason to exclude these two series, however, we present the seasonal patterns
but suggest that they be interpreted with
caution. Kosambi and Raghavachari
(1951) present evidence on birth seasonality in India during the pre-WWII period.

The patterns for the three regions
shown in Panel A—Delhi, Maharashtra, and Punjab—are strikingly
similar to patterns for southern regions
of the United States. Delhi, the region
of India with the most extreme amplitude in seasonality, has an April-May
trough and a September peak. As seen
in Table 1, the peak-to-trough amplitude and the R? for the regression for
Delhi are much higher than those for
other populations in Figures 3 and 4.
The two other regions shown in Panel B,
Kerala and West Bengal, display somewhat different seasonal patterns, although West Bengal does exhibit a local
September peak, a feature frequently
observed in the seasonal patterns presented here.

Panel C shows the seasonal birth patterns for two regions of Japan, the Tokyo and Kagoshima prefectures. Tokyo
is at a latitude close to that of Washington, D.C., while Kagoshima is at a latitude close to that of Georgia. Seasonal
fluctuations in Japan are closer in magnitude to those of the North American
and European populations than to those
in India, and they show some similarity
to the North American pattern of a September peak followed by a November
trough. Panel D of the figure shows the
seasonal birth pattern for Israel. Israel’s
pattern is remarkably similar to that in
the southern United States, exhibiting
an April trough and September peak,
with an amplitude of 15 per cent.

In Panels E and F of Figure 4 we show
the seasonal birth patterns for the southern hemisphere countries of Australia,
New Zealand, and South Africa. Although comparisons of seasonal patterns across hemispheres are appealing
to test a number of hypotheses about
birth seasonality, such comparisons are
in practice inconclusive.

The pattern shown for Australia,
consisting of a global March peak, a local September peak, and a November-—
December trough, is surprisingly similar
to the pattern for England in Figure 3.
Earlier analyses of birth seasonality in
Australia, however, identify a September global peak. Rosenberg (1966), for
example, presents a seasonal pattern for
South Australia for the period 1957-59
that is remarkably similar to the United
States pattern in both timing and magnitude. Mathers and Harris (1983) analyze
three-year periods from 1962 to 1979
and conclude that the Australian pattern shifts from a September peak to a
March peak (see also Macfarlane and
Spalding, 1960; Lyster, 1979; and
Parker, 1978, 1979). The change in pattern is primarily a change in relative
magnitudes. The March and September
local peaks shown in our estimates in
Figure 3 appear in virtually all periods in
Australia, with the September peak being more predominant in earlier periods.

The pattern for New Zealand, also
shown in Panel E of Figure 3, demonstrates a seasonal pattern similar in
shape to that of Australia, but with the
September peak significantly more pronounced. The New Zealand pattern,
with the sharp September peak and
April—May trough, displays the key features of the U.S. pattern.

Panel F shows the seasonal birth pattern by racial group for South Africa.

Lam and Miron

Social Biology

South African blacks in the period
1953-77 exhibit a pattern quite similar
to the pattern in the southern United
States, with a May trough and a September peak. The pattern for South African
whites is smaller in amplitude and somewhat different in shape, although whites
display a September local peak and December trough similar to the pattern for
blacks. Cowgill (1965) and Crook and
Dyson (1980) document a September
peak for all races in South Africa using
data for earlier periods, while Dyson
and Crook (1981) suggest that the pattern for whites changes in more recent
periods to a pattern with a March peak.
Their comparisons across time are based
on only three-year periods, however.
These periods may be too short to establish systematic seasonal patterns.

The stylized fact established by the
geographical comparisons in Figures 3
and 4 is that there is no simple rule determining which population displays a
particular seasonal pattern of births.
The “U.S.” pattern and the ‘‘European” pattern show up in many populations, but not according to any simple
scheme. The September global or local
peak does appear in numerous cases,
across a wide variety of geographical
and cultural settings. There is no evidence that seasonal patterns are consistent within hemisphere or simply reversed across northern and southern
hemispheres.

CHANGES OVER TIME IN BIRTH
SEASONALITY

A second important characteristic of
the cross-population variation in seasonal patterns is the stability of these
patterns over time. We begin by examining what is surely the longest time series of monthly births in existence, the
300-year series constructed by Wrigley

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

Vol. 38, No. 1-2

and Schofield (1981) for pre-industrial
England. As mentioned above, this is
the only data source we use that is not
based directly on vital statistics, so a
number of caveats are in order. The series used here is exactly as published in
Wrigley and Schofield’s Appendix
A2.4, as constructed from parish reconstitutions. The time between birth and
baptism, and possible changes in this interval across seasons and across time,
may confound the seasonal pattern, in
addition to distorting the secular
changes in this pattern (see Wrigley and
Schofield, 1981, for a discussion of some
of these issues). We find it unlikely that
the dramatic decrease in seasonality discussed below can be explained entirely
by these data problems, but the
Wrigley-Schofield monthly birth series
must be interpreted with caution.

Figure 5 shows the seasonal birth patterns for the Wrigley-Schofield series for
three periods. The figures show a dramatic decline in the amplitude of the
seasonal patterns, with the peak-totrough difference of 48 per cent in the
1539-1637 period dropping to 25 per
cent in the 1737-1836 period. Knodel
and Wilson (1981) document a similar
secular decline in birth seasonality over
a 150-year-period in eighteenth- and
nineteenth-century German villages. As
shown in Panel B of Figure 5, however,
there is still substantial seasonality in
births in England in the post-WWII period. The timing of the seasonal pattern
after WWII is remarkably similar to that
in earlier periods, with a late winter
peak and a summer trough.

Figure 5 also plots the seasonal patterns in births for a series of periods in
the twentieth century in Finland, Canada, Luxembourg, and Sweden. Given
the dramatic economic and social
changes in these countries during the

 

Seasonality of Births 63

century, the most surprising feature of
these patterns is their relative stability
through time. Luxembourg shows some
evidence of a decline in the amplitude of
seasonal fluctuations, in the form of a reduction in the March peak in births.
Canada shows very little change in its
seasonal birth pattern from the 1926-38
period to the 1963-76 period. Luxembourg and Finland show some evidence
of changes in seasonal patterns, but also
show considerable stability in the overall amplitude and in particular features
such as the local September peak and
the October-December trough. Most
surprising of all is the increase in
seaonality in Sweden during the twentieth century. While the basic shape of the
pattern remains similar, the peak-totrough amplitude increases from 17 per
cent in the 1921—38 period to 31 per cent
in the 1969-87 period.

Changes over time for the United
States are illustrated in Figure 6. The
figure compares the seasonal pattern by
racial group for Georgia and New York
for two separate periods, 1948-68 and
1969-86. (U.S. vital statistics are classified by white and nonwhite prior to
1969, and for white and black beginning
in 1969. The change in classification is
not especially critical in states such as
Georgia and New York where blacks
are by far the predominant component
of nonwhite births.) The most significant change over time is a substantial
decline in the amplitude of birth seasonality for whites in Georgia. Seasonality
for blacks in the South, and for both
blacks and whites in the North, changes
very little in either timing or amplitude
across the two periods. The decline in
birth seasonality for whites in the U.S.
South has been documented in previous
research by Querec and Spratley (1978)
and Seiver (1985).

Fic 6 —U S birthseasonality Percentage deviations from trend 1n births by month of birth

These secular changes in seasonal
patterns indicate that although seasonality may be less important now than
during the pre-industrial period, it has
not disappeared in any population and
has actually increased in one. Further,
the timing of the seasonal patterns has
remained essentially unchanged even in
those populations where there have
been changes in overall amplitude.

VARIATIONS IN BIRTH SEASONALITY
Across SUB-POPULATIONS

Vital statistics for some countries
make it possible to estimate seasonal

patterns for subpopulations that are potentially relevant to interpreting the determinants of birth seasonality. Figure
6, analyzed above with respect to
changes over time in seasonality in the
United States, also demonstrates the existence of substantial differences in the
magnitude of birth seasonality for U.S.
whites and nonwhites. In Georgia there
is a marked decrease in the magnitude
of the spring trough over time for whites
but no obvious change in the pattern for
blacks. In New York, however, the difference in the magnitude of this trough
is clearly present and of approximately

the same magnitude for both the early
and later sample periods. In Lam and
Miron (1987), we demonstrate that
these results hold generally for states in
the South and Northeast.

Figure 7 presents seasonal patterns
for a variety of additional subpopulations. Panels A and B contrast seasonal
patterns for first births versus second
births for whites and nonwhites in the
United States. (Births by birth order are
not available at the state level in published vital statistics data.) The seasonal
patterns are quite similar for the two
groups. There is some evidence of
slightly more seasonality in first births
for whites, but the difference is small
and causes no change in the basic timing
of peaks and troughs.

Panels C, D, and E of Figure 7 contrast the seasonal patterns for legitimate
and illegitimate births for England, Finland, and Sweden. For England the patterns are virtually identical in both timing and magnitude. For Finland the
patterns are similar in the most pronounced features and have similar amplitudes. In Sweden the timing of peaks
and troughs is the same for legitimate
and illegitimate births, but illegitimate
births exhibit a lower amplitude in seasonal fluctuations.

Panel F of Figure 7 compares births
in rural and urban Sweden during the
post-WWII period. The striking feature
of the rural-urban comparison for Sweden is the similarity in both the timing
and amplitude of the seasonal fluctuations in the two regions. Results reported in Table 1 but not included in the
graph indicate that the significant increase in the amplitude of Swedish birth
seasonality during the twentieth century, documented above in Figure 5, is
similar in rural and urban areas. For urban births, the peak-to-trough ampli

tude rises from 14 per cent in the 192138 period to 26 per cent in the 1948-64
period, while for rural births the corresponding increase is from 18 per cent to
24 per cent.

SUMMARY OF BAsiIc FAcTS

We can summarize the facts presented above as follows:

1. Seasonality is a quantitatively important feature of the variation in births
in populations covering a wide variety of
geographical areas, historical periods,
and cultural settings.

2. The presence of a particular seasonal pattern is not governed simply by
the hemisphere in which that country resides.

3. There does not appear to be a consistent conclusion about whether the
amount of seasonality increases or decreases over time. In some countries the
amount decreases significantly; in many
it remains stable; and in one (Sweden) it
increases significantly.

4. The differences in seasonal patterns across urban/rural populations are
relatively small.

5. The differences in the patterns of
legitimate and illegitimate births are
small, at least in Sweden, Finland, and
England. Similarly, the differences by
birth order, at least for the United
States, are not quantitatively important.

6. Other comparisons across subpopulation, such as those by race or income
class, provide conflicting results.

DISCUSSION
EXPLANATIONS OF BIRTH SEASONALITY

We turn now to discussing the proposed explanations of birth seasonality
found in the literature. A number of the
existing explanations are based on ex

amination of data for one population,
and many of these hypotheses appear
reasonable when confronted with evidence from only a few countries. Since
alternative explanations of birth seasonality have implications for the crosscountry or cross-time period variation in
seasonal patterns, however, it is useful
to confront these explanations with the
variety of seasonal patterns presented
above. We show below that these facts
do not by themselves eliminate any interesting hypothesis. The results do,
however, place significant limits on how
important various explanations might
be for an overall understanding of birth
seasonality, and they suggest avenues
that future research should follow in order to pursue these explanations further.

Since the number of proposed explanations of birth seasonality in the existing literature is large and diverse, it is
useful to have a simple framework
within which to discuss proposed explanations. We organize our discussion of
the literature around the possible exogenous determinants of birth seasonality,
namely, the weather, the agricultural
cycle, economic variables, holidays, and
the marriage rate. It is of course possible
that the seasonality in some of these variables is a response to the seasonality in
births. For example, couples may
choose to get married nine months before the month in which they would like
to have a birth. While we recognize the
possibility of such endogeneities, we regard them as sufficiently implausible
that we do not discuss them further in
this paper. We emphasize wherever
possible the behavioral or biological
mechanisms through which these variables may be operating. Lam and Miron
(1987) present a simple, formal model of
birth seasonality.

 

Social Biology

WEATHER

There are a number of possible
mechanisms through which the seasonality of the weather might determine the
seasonality of births. On the behavioral
side, couples may desire births in spring
months because this improves the health
and survival probabilities of the child or
fetus. Women may desire spring births
because it is uncomfortable to be pregnant in the summer (Rodgers and Udry,
1988). In addition, couples may choose
to engage in intercourse more often in
certain seasons because of the weather.
In the first two cases, it is the expected
variation in the weather that is crucial,
since couples’ frequency of intercourse
is determined before knowing the
weather at the time of the birth. In the
third case, the actual value of the
weather in the month of intercourse
might be important. On the biological
side, seasonal fluctuations in temperature or other aspects of the weather may
affect fecundity through a number of
mechanisms that are outlined below.

Previous literature on the seasonality
of births provides some evidence supporting weather-based explanations. Indirect evidence is provided by comparisons Of seasonal patterns across
socioeconomic groups. Greater seasonality for lower-income classes could be
interpreted as evidence supporting
weather-induced seasonality, since
high-income groups may control their
environment more completely than lowincome groups. The most recent analysis of socioeconomic differentials in seasonality is by Kestenbaum (1987), who
uses the 1980 U.S. census to identify the
quarterly pattern in births in years immediately prior to the census, controlling for parental income. Consistent
with a number of previous studies for
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

Vol. 38, No. 1-2

the U.S., Kestenbaum finds somewhat
greater seasonality among lowerincome groups. Based on characteristics
of parents at the time of the 1980 census,
April-June births in 1977—79 were 6 per
cent below the annual average for those
with less than high-school education,
but were only 3 per cent below the annual average for those with college education. Kestenbaum’s results are subject
to the criticism that income and education in his sample are highly correlated
with residence in northern versus southern states. His results may therefore
simply reflect the large north-south differentials in seasonality, as seen in Figure 3, rather than provide independent
evidence of socioeconomic differentials.
Earlier studies of socioeconomic differentials in birth seasonality are somewhat inconclusive, being based on small
geographical areas and/or short time periods. Pasamanick et al. (1959, 1960) report more seasonality in low-income
groups than in high-income groups in
Baltimore, although reexamination by
Zelnik (1969) indicates no significant
differences between income groups. A
replication of the Baltimore study by
Chaudhury (1972) supports the finding
of greater seasonality among lowerincome groups, and Warren and Tyler
(1979) find similar differences based on
birth records for a county in Georgia. In
contrast to these findings of greater seasonality among low-income groups in
the United States, James (1971), comparing birth seasonality across social
classes in England, finds less seasonality
among low-income groups. His results
are based on comparisons for only a single year’s vital statistics data, however.
The role of weather in seasonality in
the United States is examined indirectly
by Seiver (1985). His test of the hypothesis that summer heat explains the

 

Seasonality of Births 69

April—May trough in births is based ona
regression of the time trend in the magnitude of the May seasonal effect for
each state between 1960 and 1970 on the
increase in air conditioning in the state
between the 1960 and 1970 censuses.
Seiver’s interesting results provide support for the hypothesis that summer
heat reduces conceptions and thus partially explain the April-May trough in
births. Seiver’s results do not explain the
August-September peak in births, the
other dominant feature of the U.S. seasonality pattern. Seiver (1989) tests the
role of weather more directly by estimating the effect of summer temperature extremes on births nine months
later. His results indicate that increases
in summer temperatures have a direct
negative effect on births.

In addition to Seiver’s (1989) use of
monthly weather data for the United
States, the effects of the weather on fertility have been tested using direct
weather variables by Lee (1981) and
Richards (1983), although they do not
consider seasonality per se. Lee uses
over three hundred years (1541-1871)
of monthly, seasonally adjusted data for
England to determine the effects of temperature and rainfall on births seven to
eleven months later. He finds that temperature extremes reduce future fertility
rates, mainly through intrauterine mortality effects. The estimates are statistically significant, but quantitatively
small. Richards estimates the effect of
temperature extremes on annual births
for France for the period 1740-1909.
Her point estimates are consistent with
the hypothesis that temperature extremes reduce fertility nine months
later, but the estimates are never statistically significant. Chang et al. (1963),
using data for Hong Kong, report a
strong negative correlation between the

seasonal pattern in temperature and the
seasonal pattern of conceptions. Their
results are consistent with a weatherbased explanation of birth seasonality,
but they fit other explanations as well. In
particular, the seasonal pattern in marriages matches the seasonal pattern in
conceptions quite well.

Recent work by Becker et al. (1986)
may suggest an important effect of the
weather on birth seasonality in Matlab,
Bangladesh. Their study finds that the
large seasonal variation in fecundability
can be only partially explained by the
seasonal variation in the frequency of intercourse. In particular, there is a peak
in frequency of intercourse in September, the period of lowest fecundability.
Since September is the month with highest mean monthly temperature, an effect of temperature on spermatogenesis
or the fetal loss rate appears likely. As
emphasized by Becker et al. (1986),
however, further investigation is required to determine the precise mechanisms through which temperature affects fecundability.

The most thorough examination of
the role of weather in producing the seasonality of births is that by Roenneberg
and Aschoff (1989), who find that temperature and latitude (which they interpret as a proxy for photoperiod) explain
much of the variation in seasonal patterns across countries. They note, however, that the effects of temperature and
latitude are reversed across America
and the rest of the world. Their work
does not, therefore, explain the differences in seasonal patterns between the
United States and Western Europe,
which arguably constitute some of the
most intriguing puzzles. The differences
in seasonal patterns that they fail to explain coincide exactly with those left unexplained by Lam and Miron (1990).
They find significant effects of summer

 

Social Biology

heat extremes in reducing summer conceptions, but they do not explain the
significant increases in summer conceptions that occur in much of Europe.

The biomedical literature contains
some evidence that weather affects the
biological probability of conception, as
well as some evidence of seasonality in
this probability, which may reflect the
weather. Levine et al. (1988) show that
semen quality in a sample of 1,235 men
deteriorates significantly from winter to
summer in New Orleans, with the size of
the deterioration greatest in those occupations most exposed to external temperature. Similarly, Levine et al. (1990)
find that several measures of semen
quality deteriorate from winter to summer in a sample of 131 men who work
outdoors in San Antonio, Texas, although they find no correlation between
the magnitude of the deterioration and
the number of hours spent without airconditioning. Zorgniotti and Sealfon
(1988) find significantly higher scrotal
temperatures in subfertile than normospermic men. Studies of small numbers
of subjects suggest monthly variations in
male hormones related to sexual activity
(Reinberg, 1974; Reinberg et al, 1978),
without explaining the sources of the
variations directly. Research based on a
sample of males in Houston, Texas, indicates significant seasonal variation in
sperm count, with peaks in February
and March and a trough in September
(Tjoa et al., 1982). This pattern of peaks
and troughs in sperm count implies a
peak in births in November and December and a trough in June, predictions
that differ by one to two months from
the seasonal pattern in births in Texas.

Seasonal variations in menstrual cycles and menarche have also been documented (Sundararaj et al., 1978;
Brundtland and Liestol, 1982), suggesting possible physiological explanations
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

Vol. 38, No. 1-2

of seasonality on the female side as well.
Results for a sample of women in Minnesota show some shortening of menstrual cycles during spring and summer
months (Sundararaj et al., 1978). Again
no direct explanations of the seasonal
variations in menstruation are provided,
although Sundararaj et al. speculate
that the effects might result from seasonal changes in physical activity or external temperature. The weather may
also operate through effects on intrauterine mortality. Holmes (1968), Macfarlane (1970), and Tromp (1963), for
example, discuss the possible relationship between temperature extremes, intrauterine mortality, and birth seasonality. The evidence is mixed on whether
such an effect is empirically important
(Slatis and DeCloux, 1967; Huntington,
1938; McDonald, 1971; Warren et al.,
1980).

Research on animal populations suggests that several factors, especially
photoperiod, cause conceptions to be
timed so that births are concentrated in
the spring, when survival probabilities
are highest (Karsch et al., 1984). Although the relationship between photoperiod and seasonal breeding in animals
appears to be well established, there has
been little research analyzing effects of
photoperiod on human reproduction.
Ehrenkranz (1983a, 1983b) argues that
photoperiod variations may explain seasonal variation in conceptions among
Eskimo populations, but his results are
based on small samples and provide
only indirect evidence at best of an effect of photoperiod on human reproduction. Roenneberg and Aschoff (1989b)
argue for an important effect of photoperiod using latitude as a proxy. As
mentioned above, their results are suggestive but do not explain some of the
most striking puzzles in the data.

Seasonality of Births 71

The evidence in the existing literature is therefore inconclusive concerning the possible role of the weather. The
evidence that we have provided above
on cross-population comparisons presents a clear challenge to any weatherbased hypothesis. According to the simplest possible model of the relation between weather and either behavior or
biology, countries in the northern hemisphere should display similar seasonal
patterns, and these patterns should be
six months reversed from the patterns
displayed in the southern hemisphere.
Yet, as we have documented above,
there is little consistency to the patterns
across countries or hemispheres. The
simplest case of a single northern hemisphere pattern that is reversed by six
months in the southern hemisphere
clearly does not hold, even across countries that are culturally and economically quite similar. The significant differences between the United States and
European patterns, and the striking similarity of the United States and New
Zealand patterns, are a clear challenge
to any explanation of birth seasonality
based only on seasonal weather patterns.

The difficulties involved in explaining
the cross-population differences in birth
seasonality by means of differences in
weather seasonality are illustrated
clearly in Figure 8. Panel A shows the
seasonal pattern in births in Georgia,
Minnesota, New York, and Sweden,
while Panel B shows monthly average
temperature for the same locations. Although the basic shape of the seasonal
patterns in temperature are the same,
the differences in birth seasonals are
dramatic. It seems likely that no explanation based solely on weather effects
can reconcile these data.

Fic. 8.—Seasonality in births, temperature, and marriages, Georgia, Minnesota, New York, and

Sweden.

The evidence presented above does
not completely rule out the effects of the
weather. The argument that countries in
the same hemisphere should have similar seasonal patterns obviously relies on
the assumption that countries within the
same hemisphere have similar weather.
While Figure 8 shows that this assumption is correct regarding the basic timing
of warm months and cold months, it
may not be accurate with respect to the
dimensions of the weather that determine birth outcomes. For example, it
may be that the weather is only impor
tant when it reaches extreme values,
such as the summertime heat experienced by the southern United States. If
this is the case, then the weather might
have quite different effects in Georgia
than in Sweden, even though summer is
the warmest season in both locations.

AGRICULTURE

The second variable that is often proposed as an important determinant of
the seasonal fluctuations in births is the
agricultural cycle. The harvest cycle
might operate on birth outcomes

Vol. 38, No. 1-2

through a number of mechanisms, and
there is some evidence in the literature
to support each of these mechanisms.
Nurge (1970) hypothesizes a relationship between labor demand and the desired timing of births and finds corroborating evidence in data from a German
peasant village. More recently, Levy
(1986) finds patterns of birth seasonality
in contemporary rural Egypt that are
consistent with attempts to avoid births
in the periods of peak labor demand.
Mosher (1979) argues that seasonal variation in nutrition explains much of the
seasonal variation in births in Taiwan
during the 1926-76 period.

The agricultural cycle may affect the
frequency of intercourse by raising its
opportunity cost in periods of peak labor demand, including as an extreme
case spousal separation due to seasonal
labor migration (Chen et al., 1974; van
de Walle, 1975; Menken, 1979; Massey
and Mullan, 1984). Spencer et al. (1976)
and Spencer and Hum (1977) argue that
decreases in workload during periods of
low agricultural labor demand lead to
increased conceptions in several populations. Knodel and Wilson (1981) report
evidence of a strong seasonal pattern in
births in eighteenth- and nineteenthcentury German villages. The most pronounced feature of the pattern is an
early summer trough which the authors
argue is consistent with reduced conceptions during the harvest period of August through November.

The agricultural cycle is a plausible
hypothesis to explain birth seasonality,
and it may well have played an important role in pre-industrial societies. In
particular, the dramatic decline in the
amplitude of seasonal birth fluctuations
in pre-industrial England probably
reflects the declining importance of the
agricultural sector. In addition, the agri
 

Seasonality of Births 73

cultural cycle is obviously a key determinant of birth seasonality in some current
less-developed, highly agricultural societies such as Matlab, Bangladesh (Becker, 1981). The fact that the seasonal
pattern in pre-industrial England
emerges consistently in northern European countries well into the twentieth
century, however, suggests that the agricultural explanation is far from the entire story. More importantly, the increasing seasonality in Sweden,
combined with the similarity of rural
and urban patterns, makes it highly implausible that this is the main effect in
modern populations.

ECONOMIC VARIABLES

In addition to the possible role of the
agricultural cycle, a number of other economic variables may be important determinants of the seasonality of births. If
labor force opportunities for women are
seasonal, they may attempt to time
pregnancies so that as little work time as
possible is lost due to pregnancy and/or
child care. Alternatively, seasonality
in male labor force participation could
affect the amount of contact between
husbands and wives. There are large
seasonals in economic activity in most
economies, and these patterns turn out
to be very similar around the world
(Barsky and Miron, 1989; Beaulieu and
Miron, 1990a,b).

The results presented in Figure 5
above provide suggestive evidence on
the possible role of these other economic variables in producing the seasonality of births. It seems unlikely that
seasonal variations in economic variables are the primary factor in determining the seasonality of births because of
the marked absence of dramatic
changes in the timing of seasonality over
long periods. For the five long time se

74 Lam and Miron

ries we consider (England, Finland,
Sweden, Canada, and Luxembourg),
we have data covering a transition from
an almost entirely agricultural economy
to a significantly industrial one. There is
no reason to believe that the seasonality
in agricultural and industrial activities is
the same, so the stability in the timing of
the patterns over time suggests an absence of strong economic effects.

HOoLipAys

Increased leisure time due to holidays, and the availability of other activities that may compete with or complement sexual activity, could also lead to
seasonal variations in conceptions and
births. Of course, it may be difficult to
distinguish the effects of seasonal patterns in holidays, economic activity, and
the weather, since the seasonality in economic activity and holidays may be determined simultaneously, with both of
these possibly influenced by seasonal
weather patterns. Casual observation,
however, suggests that the winter holidays associated with Christmas, the
New Year, and possibly Hannukah are
important determinants of leisure time
in a substantial fraction of the world, so
evidence that births or conceptions are
concentrated in December would suggest one particular holiday effect. Sucha
“Christmas effect” has been mentioned
frequently in discussions of the September peak in U.S. births (e.g., Rosenberg, 1966) and is cited by Wrigley and
Schofield (1981) as a possible explanation for a persistent September local
peak in English births. Calot (1981) emphasizes August vacations as the reason
for the strong May peak in births in
France, and James (1971) argues that increased leisure time in holiday periods
may explain his finding of greater seasonality among higher-income groups in
England.

Social Biology

A number of features of the crosspopulation comparisons shed light on
the hypothesis that holidays affect the
seasonal pattern in births. The most noticeable is the evidence in favor of a
Christmas effect on the conception rate.
In almost every Christian country, in either hemisphere, there is at least a local
September peak in births, consistent
with increased conceptions during the
Christmas holiday season. The persistent September peak is one of the intriguing recurring patterns across countries.
It has no obvious explanation in terms of
weather, especially since it occurs in
both hemispheres and at all latitudes.
The hypothesis that it is attributable to a
Christmas holiday effect, however,
must confront the presence of a September peak in the non-Christian countries
of Israel and India. One possibility is
that the increase in conceptions around
Christmas is due to an increase in leisure
time that occurs in all countries independent of religion.

The other regular pattern in the data
that may reflect the timing of holidays is
the persistent spring peak in European
countries, consistent with the hypothesis that there is increased sexual activity
during the leisure time associated with
summer holiday periods. The explanation of Sweden’s spring peak as the
result of summer holidays is consistent
with the surprising secular increase in
the amplitude of Sweden’s spring peak
over recent decades, an increase that
could result from increased leisure time
durig the summer in response to rising
incomes. The data can be little more
than suggestive of the role of summer
holidays, however, in the absence of
more direct tests.

MARRIAGES

The possible effect of seasonal fluctuations in marriage rates on birth seaDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

Vol. 38, No. 1-2

sonality has been considered by a number of researchers, with mixed results.
Rosenberg (1966) finds little effect of
marriage seasonality on birth seasonality in the United States based on the
large divergence between the seasonal
pattern in marriages, which is dominated by a large peak in June, and the
seasonal pattern in births, which implies
below-average conceptions in June and
July. Rosenberg also notes that legitimate and illegitimate births display similar seasonal patterns, based on data for
the single year of 1963. Rosenberg’s
skepticism over the influence of marriage seasonality on birth seasonality
has been repeated by other researchers.
Mathers and Harris (1983), for example, conclude that marriage seasonality
has little effect on birth seasonality in
Australia because of the similarity between the seasonal patterns in legittmate and illegitimate births.

A recent noteworthy exception to the
view that marriage is unimportant in influencing birth seasonality is Prioux
(1988), who reports a significant peak in
conceptions for first births in October in
Italy, based on data for the period 196079. Prioux attributes this peak to a peak
in marriages in September—October.
Higher-order births do not exhibit the
same October peak in conceptions in
Italy. Prioux argues that the overall
level of birth seasonality increased in
Italy during this period as first births became a higher fraction of all births.

Our own evidence presented above
also provides a mixed assessment of the
possible role of marriages. Comparisons
of the seasonal patterns for legitimate
and illegitimate births (Figure 7) give little support to an important role for marriage seasonality, since the major peaks
and troughs in the seasonal birth pattern
are the same for legitimate and illegitimate births. In England, the patterns for

Seasonality of Births 75

legitimate and illegitimate births are virtually identical. Likewise, the similarity
of seasonal birth patterns by birth order
in the United States (Figure 7, Panels A
and B) raises serious difficulties for the
marriage cycle as an important determinant of birth seasonality.

Seasonal patterns in marriages for
three populations, Sweden, Georgia,
and New York, are presented in Panel C
of Figure 8. The change of scale compared to the graphs for birth seasonality
is important to note, indicating the
much higher magnitude of marriage seasonality. Sweden has a peak-to-trough
amplitude of almost 150 per cent, while
the states of Georgia and New York
have amplitudes of over 60 per cent.

All three patterns indicate large June
peaks in marriages. If this marriage
peak had a large effect on birth seasonality, it would presumably show up as an
increase in births in March. Looking
back at the seasonal birth patterns in
Panel A, we do not see a sharp March
peak in births in any of the populations,
although there is a small local peak in
births in March in New York. The April
peak in births in Sweden could be partially influenced by the June peak in marriages, although we have seen that illegitimate births display a seasonal
pattern virtually identical to that shown
in Panel A.

CONCLUSIONS

The empirical results in this paper
present a set of basic stylized facts about
the seasonality of births. We show that
births are highly seasonal in all human
populations, even for very recent periods in highly industrialized low-fertility
populations. The timing of the seasonal
patterns, however, differs widely across
populations. Although a large literature
exists on birth seasonality, the magnitude and persistence of seasonal fluctuations in births continue to be important
empirical puzzles in demography. The
fact that births in April are 31 per cent
greater than births in December in contemporary urban Sweden, for example,
is a dramatic result that begs for an explanation, especially in light of our finding that the amplitude of this seasonal
cycle in Sweden has increased during the
twentieth century.

This paper has surveyed possible explanations of the seasonality of births
and considered whether those explanations can rationalize the basic stylized
facts about birth seasonality. We conclude that existing evidence places some
limits on the kinds of explanations that
may be important, but it does not decisively either rule out or support any interesting hypothesis. In order to make
additional progress in understanding the
determinants of birth seasonality, we
believe it is necessary to use data on variables other than births, to employ more
disaggregated data sets, and to explicitly

Social Biology

account for multivariate explanations.

Our results suggest that there may be
high returns to further research on birth
seasonality and its underlying determinants. The two effects that appear to be
most consistent with observed seasonal
patterns, i.e., seasonal fluctuations in
weather and seasonal fluctuations in leisure time due to holidays, both raise
provocative issues. It is well worth seeing whether what appears to be a relatively large effect of summer heat in reducing fertility holds up to direct tests
using monthly weather data (Lam and
Miron, 1990). It is not clear whether this
effect is due to behavioral or biological
effects, and further research is clearly
called for on the short-run relationship
between temperature and fertility in
modern populations. Similarly, the notion that holidays are associated with
nontrivial increases in conceptions in
highly contracepting low-fertility populations also poses a challenge to our understanding of modern fertility behavior. It is important to determine whether
this apparent feature of the seasonal
patterns stands up to more direct tests
and to examine the specific behavior
that may produce it.
