Changes in the Use of Oral Contraceptives

by Rhode Island Women
Between 1967 and 1970

Since oral contraceptives were approved
for general use in 1960, this method of
birth control has rapidly become the most
widely used of all contraceptives by American women. A “contraceptive revolution”
occurred during the 1960’s resulting in a
broad acceptance of the pill. Nevertheless,
sufficient controversy has arisen over the
pill to suggest that a leveling off, or even
a decline, in its use may be possible.

The physical side effects of the pill have
been widely documented, especially through
the United States Senate committee hearings on the topic (Ross, 1970). A second
source of controversy is limited to the
Roman Catholic church and the issue of
whether oral contraceptives are acceptable
to church doctrine. While many liberal
theologians see no moral problem, the
numerous statements of Pope Paul VI on
the topic make it clear that the use of the
pill, as a contraceptive, is still not officially
accepted (Humanae Vitae, 1968). Thus,
while the pill has “swept the nation,” it
has engendered serious controversy of both
medical and theological dimensions that
may limit its continued use.

The National Fertility study of 1965 was
the first comprehensive survey that allowed

“an assessment of the extent of the acceptance and use of oral contraceptives by...
{American} married couples” (Ryder and
Westoff, 1971, p. 139). The authors found
that 15.5% of all married women under
age 45 were currently using the pill. Furthermore, the month-by-month analysis of
previous usage revealed a steady increase
from 1960 to 1965. Almost 26% were
“Ever users” and another 19%, who had
not used contraceptives, indicated plans for
future usage (Ryder and Westoff, 1971,
p. 141-143).

More recent data are somewhat scant.
Jones and Nortman have summarized these
data through 1967 in their Population
Council report (1968). Ryder and Westoff
reinterviewed their 1965 Catholic respondents in 1969 and found that among women
married at least four years, the proportion
using the pill had increased from 14% to
379 (Ryder and Westoff, 1971, p. 209).
Bouvier (unpublished), in analyzing 1968—
69 surveys of the Rhode Island population
noted that about one-third of all married
women under age 50 who had ever practiced birth control had used oral contraceptives at some time in their married lives.
About one-quarter of the “Present users”

were using the pill, and 30% of all “Future
users” planned to utilize this method of
birth control. It is quite obvious that the
pill has gained numerous adherents over
the past decade, and its importance in contemporary family planning programs warrants an ongoing survey of possible changes
in use.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The annual surveys of the Rhode Island
population provide a unique opportunity
to assess the extent of continued use of
pills, the characteristics of “dropouts,” and
the reasons for discontinuance. The Rhode
Island Health Survey, conducted by the
Population Research Laboratory of Brown
University, consists of yearly field interviews with random samples of Rhode Islarid
households. Three independent samples of
the population were surveyed during the
fall of 1967, 1968, and 1969. In addition,
the design of the study calls for each of
these samples to be reinterviewed once a
year following the original interview. The
latest completed follow-up was in the fall
of 1970, at which time efforts were made
to reinterview ell past respondents (1967—

Social Biology

69). The design of the survey thus provides
both a series of independent cross-sectional
samples and a set of panels followed longitudinally from one to three years (Organic
and Goldstein, 1969; Organic, 1971).

This report on pill usage in Rhode Island
focuses first on the-three independent annual samples of the state’s population to
note the extent of such usage in the years
1967-69. Second, the report utilizes the
follow-up survey of 1970 to determine patterns of change, dropout rates, and reasons
for discontinuing the use of oral contraceptives. The samples thus allow an assessment of possible changes in pill usage since
1967 for the female population as a whole.
More important, they also allow an examination of changes in the contraceptive
behavior of the same women over a period
of time. The samples are all restricted to
married women under age 50 at the time ~
of the respective surveys. Also, the data
only include couples married once and
presently fecund.

The sociodemographic characteristics of
the three independent random samples of
the state’s population. are summarized in
Table 1. As can be observed, Rhode Island

is predominantly Catholic, being the only
state with a majority of its citizens adhering to that faith. The proportion of women
with more than a high school education
is quite small, and other studies concentrating on Rhode Island have found a
strong relationship between educational
attainment and religious affiliation. That is
to say, non-Catholics are much more likely
to have had some college training than
Catholics.

Oral Contraceptives

53

Female respondents were asked: “Have you
ever heard of oral contraceptives . . . the
pill that some women use to delay or
prevent pregnancy or to regulate their
periods?” and: ‘‘Have you ever used these
pills?” Those replying affirmatively were
then asked: “Are (were) you using the pill
at least partly to delay or prevent pregnancy?” In this study only those who
indicated its use for birth control purposes
are considered “Users.” As noted in Table 2,

The 1970 follow-up survey cannot be
viewed as a representative sample of the
state’s population in that year. It misses
those women who attained the age of 50
since their original interviews. It does not
include the newly married women who
entered the pertinent “universe” since
1967-69. As is often the case with panel
studies, a number of respondents could not
be reached in 1970, and some did not cooperate in the follow-up. About 16% of
the original panel members were not interviewed in 1970 and these have not been
replaced. Nevertheless, the data in Table 1
suggest that the respondent loss was not
biased by religion or education, but the
proportion of older women is smaller in
the follow-up than in the original samples.

RESULTS

series of questions on oral contraceptives.

the proportion presently using the pill has
declined since 1967 when 18.0% of all the
women were users. By 1969, the proportion
was only 14.7%. Controlling for age does
not eliminate this pattern for those under
40. Among women under 30, the proportion
of current users declined from 28.9% in
1967 to 21.1% in 1969.

Educational attainment of women is an
important variable that must be considered
when analyzing family planning behavior.
As Ryder and Westoff have stated, it is a
“variable of major relevance for the adoption of a new method of contraception”
(1971, p. 146). It is often noted that the
diffusion process generally begins with the
better educated and then filters down to
those with less schooling (Rodgers, 1962).
Such a pattern was found in the 1965 study
—22% of the college graduates being current users compared to 7% of those with
only a grade school education. Ryder and
Westoff (1971, p. 147) concluded that this

“probably reflect[s] the greater awareness
of and receptivity to innovation that are
generally cultivated by education.”

The Rhode Island data on pill usage by
educational attainment of the women are
summarized in Table 3. These cross

69% of the respondents professed the

concerning the theological propriety of oral
contraception, there is evidence that Catholic women are increasingly using birth
control methods not approved by their

sectional analyses by year of survey are
limited to two categories because of the
small number of women who have gone
beyond high school in each of these years.
Thus, these findings must be viewed with
caution. In 1967, high school graduates
were almost twice as likely to be users of
the pill as were those without a completed
secondary school education. However, this
variation diminishes in 1968 and 1969 when
the better educated become less oriented to
the pill while the less educated remain
relatively stable in their usage. Especially
noteworthy is the evidence that the proportion of high school graduates taking the
pill declined from 22% in 1967 to 16.8%
in 1969.

It has been noted that Roman Catholics
constitute a majority of the Rhode Island
population. In the present study, about

church’s magisterium. Foremost among
these is the pill. Potvin, Westoff, and Ryder
(1968), found that by 1965 no less than
53% of all Catholic women between 18 and
39 did not conform to Catholic teaching in
their family limitation practice. This compares to 38% in 1960 and 30% in 1955
(Potvin, Westoff and Ryder, 1968). Many
of these women were using the pill. Kass
and Donaldson (1970), analyzing changes
in Catholic contraceptive usage in Rhode
Island before and after the issuance of
Humanae Vitae concluded that 61% of
those interviewed prior to the encyclical
were “non-conformists” compared to 65%
of those queried one year later.

Almost 13% of all Catholic wives in
Rhode Island were using oral contraceptives in 1969 (Table 4). This proportion
of current users has changed but very

slightly since 1967. As expected, nonCatholics were more likely to be using
the pill. In 1967, twice as many of the
latter were users as was the case among
Catholics. However, the proportion of
non-Catholic users has since declined, and
by 1969 only 20.3% were users. Thus, the
difference between the two groups was
smaller in 1969 than in 1967; but this was
due more to a decrease in use by nonCatholics than to an increase among
Catholics.

The evidence on both educational attainment and religious affiliation suggests a
certain tendency for non-Catholics and
those with at least a high school education
to be using oral contraceptives less in 1969
than they did earlier in the decade. A
stable minority of Catholics and the less
educated apparently remain convinced of
the pill’s redeeming features, as no significant changes in usage are observed for the
three-year period. Convergence may be occurring slightly as educational attainment
and religious affiliation are perhaps not as
reliable indicators of oral contraceptive
usage as they once were.

PANEL ANALYSIS

In the 1970 follow-up survey of all available respondents, the following question
was asked: “Are you currently using the
pill to keep from getting pregnant?” If the
answer was “no,” the respondent was
asked: “Do you plan to use the pill in the
future to keep from getting pregnant?”
In addition, those respondents who had
previously used the pill but had discontinued by 1970 were asked why they had
done so and whether their decision had
been influenced by the Senate hearings on
the topic held the previous winter.

By matching information gathered in the
1970 survey with that derived from the
original interviews in 1967-69, it is possible to classify women in terms of patterns

of oral contraceptive usage over time. The
categories follow those developed by Ryder
and Westoff in the 1965 national study.
However, a few methodological differences
make comparisons somewhat tenuous. First,
two previous points in time are considered
in this report—use at time of original
interview and replies then to possible earlier
use. Second, only women taking the pill
to regulate fertility are considered users
in the present report. Third, once married
and fecund women to age 50 are presently
included as compared to all wives to age 45
in the 1965 study.

The two basic divisions are “Ever used”
and “Never used.” “Ever used,” in turn,
is further subdivided. (E1) “Now using”
includes all the women using the pill at
the time of the 1970 follow-up survey.
(E2) “May use again” includes those
women not using oral contraceptives at
the time of the 1970 survey, but who had
used them at some time in the past and
indicate they may possibly use them again
in the future. (Past usage could be either
at time of original interview or prior to
that time.) (E3) “Will not use again”
also encompasses those not using the pill
in 1970 who have a record of past use, but
who reply negatively to the question on
possible future use. These three categories
include all presently-married, fecund women
under age 50 at the time of the 1970
survey who have ever used oral contraceptives. As noted in Table 5 they represent
32.3% of all the women in the study who
were available for reinterview in 1970.

“Never used” is also divided into three
categories. (N1) “May use” includes those
who have not used the pill in the past or
present (1970), but who indicate plans to
use in the future. As in the Ryder-Westoff
study, those “Not sure” are also included
as possible future users. These represent
4.1% of all the women. (N2) “Will not

use” encompasses women who have never
used oral contraceptives and have no intention of using them in the future. These
will be referred to occasionally as “Never
users.” This category contains 61.5% of
all the women. (N3) The “Never heard
of it” group consists of 12 women (2.1%).
In all subsequent analyses, these will be
combined with those in the N2 category.

Over 36% of all the women in the 1970
follow-up sample have either used the pill
or plan to do so in the future. On the
other hand, 63.6% are literally “Never
users” in the past, present, or future.
Table 5 also shows that the proportion of
past users (not currently using) who will
not return to the pill (14.0%) is about
as great as the per cent of current users;
but only 7.8% are nonusers in 1970 who
express any intention of using the pill in
the future.

Younger women are more likely to have
ever been users than older women. In fact,
over 45% of those under 30 have used
oral contraceptives at some time in their
married lives. But even among these
younger women, 19.1% will not resume
use in the future, while 11.8% may tum
to oral contraceptives later. Almost half of
these youngest women are literally “Never

users.” Women 40 and over are the least
likely to have used the pill and their inclusion perhaps affects the results. Among
women under 40, 38.9% are “Ever users,”
17.5% do not plan to rely on oral contraception in the future, and 56.1% are
“Never users.”

A comparison with the 1965 national
study indicates a greater percent of ‘Ever
users” in the 1970 Rhode Island survey—
32.3% of all women under 50 in the latter
period and 25.9% of all women under 45
in 1965. However, a much greater proportion of Rhode Island ‘Ever users” will not
utilize the pill in the future. A similar
pattern is to be seen among the nonusers.
For example, in 1965, 5.0% of the women
were “Ever users” who will not use again,
and 19.0% were women who had never
used but might turn to the pill in the
future. In 1970, the Rhode Island women
in the same categories exhibited percentages of 14.0% and 4.1%, respectively. Even
if limited to those under 40, the per cents
were 17.5% and 5.0% —a reversal of the
1965 pattern. Thus, while more women have
tried the pill by 1970, a much greater number are not using it at present and do not
plan to do so in the future. Of course, the
1965 and 1970 findings are not exactly com

parable. Also, the 1970 panel data are based
on original replies that might have been
given as early as 1967.

It has been noted that the more educated
women were less likely to be using the pill
in 1969 than in 1967. The panel data yield
additional insight (Table 6) on this chang

traception was being accepted by all socioeconomic groups. There is some evidence of
disenchantment by women with more education, but this is not apparent among those
with less schooling. Diffusion can work two
ways. While educated women may have
heard of the pill earlier and may be more

ing use. Women with some college education
are more likely to be current users, and
more than half have used oral contraceptives at some time compared to about 30%
of those with only a high school education
and 27.8% of those with less schooling.
However, about half of the “Ever users”
who have had some college will not use
them again in the future, while only onethird of the least educated “Ever users”
have similar plans. The latter women are
also more apt to resume their use (or begin
using) in the future than those with a high
school education or the college trained. It is
noteworthy that in all education categories
most of the women who have never used
the pill have no intention of doing so in
the future, and this is increasingly the case
the more years of school completed.

Both the cross-sectional and the panel
analyses suggest that by 1970 oral con
innovative in their behavior, they are also
more likely to have heard of its possible
bad effects sooner through the mass media
(Aldridge, 1968; Hellman, 1969). Their
innovativeness may be leading some of them
to discontinue the use of oral contraceptives and to search for more suitable tech-_

niques of family planning. To be sure, one

in five women panel members with some
college education is currently using the pill,
but this may reflect the fact that the proportion of non-Catholics is much greater
in that education category than in the
others.

Despite some slight convergence between
1967 and 1969, there are some differences
by religious affiliation of women. This is
made quite clear in the panel analysis
summarized in Table 7. Almost threequarters of the Catholic women interviewed
in 1970 had not used oral contraceptives in

the past and 69.6% are literally “Never
users.” On the other hand, 54.0% of the
non-Catholics have not used oral contraceptives and half are “Never users.” However, half of the non-Catholic “Ever users”
will not use them again compared to 40%
of the Catholic “Ever users.” The pattern
of diffusion noted on educational attainment is not as obvious when looking at the
effects of religious affiliation. There is a
slight tendency for non-Catholics to be
more dissatisfied with oral contraceptives,
but many more have used them than have
Catholics. It has also been noted that
there has been a decrease in current usage
among non-Catholics. Nevertheless, differences exist between the two groups. Presumably there is a strong interaction
between the two independent variables
(education and religion). Unfortunately,
it is not possible to control for either while
analyzing the effects of the other due to
the small number of cases.

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DISCONTINUERS

The proportion of Rhode Island women
using the pill has decreased somewhat be
Social Biology

tween 1967 and 1969. The panel analysis
indicates there are more “Ever users” who
will not resume than there are current
nonusers planning to resume or begin its
usage. This does not negate the fact that
many who discontinue are replaced by
new, probably younger users. This section
looks at the proportion of women who have
discontinued using oral contraceptives and
analyzes the possible effects of age, educational attainment, and religious affiliation
in the discontinuation proportions. Additionally, the reasons given for stopping
will be studied.

As Ryder and Westoff (1971, p. 155156) have stated, the extent of discontinvation and the reasons for doing so are
important for two major reasons:

First, since the pill is the most effective
contraceptive yet developed, there is a high
demand for information about its acceptability from persons concerned with family
planning programs .. . . Second, the pill is
not just another contraceptive—it is a distinctive type of method. Ever since it was
licensed for sale . . . in 1960 there has been
much concern about possible consequences
for the user’s health.

In addition, the 1970 Senate hearings on
the side effects of oral contraceptives possibly may have contributed to the desire to
discontinue using the pill by some women.

This analysis focuses on the proportion
of the respondents in the 1967, 1968, and
1969 surveys who indicated they no longer
use oral contraceptives in 1970. About
30% of these women were originally interviewed in 1967. Thus, the opportunity to
become a “former user” is increased in
this study as compared to the 1965 national survey. In the present study, it is
also possible to determine usage at three
points in time: prior to the original interview; at the original interview; at the time
of the 1970 follow-up. The data in Table 8
summarize the results for the entire panel
by year of original interview. It gives

(1) the proportion of ever users who indicate they are not using the pill to limit
their family size in 1970, and (2) the
proportion of these “Discontinuers’” who
are “Recent discontinuers” (i.e, they were
using at the time of the original interviews),
or “Early discontinuers” (i.e., they had

already discontinued at time of original

interviews). The three points in time being
considered are discrete. It is possible for a
respondent to have indicated nonuse at
original interview and still have used oral
contraceptives between that date and 1970;
yet such a respondent would be categorized
as an “Early discontinuer.” Despite these
limitations, the data yield tentative information on possible differences in discontinuation rates by age, education, and
religion.

By 1970, 54.8% of all the women who
had ever used the pill had discontinued. As
expected, the per cent of “Discontinuers”
increases with length of interval between
original and follow-up interview. Similarly,
the proportion of “Recent discontinuers”
increases with length of interval. Age does

not appear to be a determining factor in
discontinuation.

Educational attainment and religious
affiliation are important factors in determining discontinuation. The proportion not
using oral contraceptives in 1970 increases
with greater educational attainment. Almost
60% of the “Ever users” with more than
a high school education have stopped taking the pill. Interestingly, most of these
are “Early discontinuers”; that is to say,
they had already stopped taking the pill at
the time of original interview. Slightly
more Catholics are likely to remain on the
pill than are non-Catholics, but this may
be explained by the difference in the educational attainment of the two groups.

These data on discontinuation reinforce
the previous findings which suggest that
women with more education are apparently
turning away from oral contraception. Not
only are they using the pill less than in
earlier years, but the discontinuation rates
are also greater for these women than for
those with less schooling. The pattern by
religious affiliation is somewhat similar, but

differences between Catholics and nonCatholics are clearer.

REASONS FOR DISCONTINUATION

Of the 186 “Ever users’ of oral contraceptives, 102 are not currently taking the
pill. These were asked: “Why did you stop
using it?” The responses were open-ended,
but every effort was made to derive a specific reason for the change (Table 9). The

tinuing was side effects. These consisted
mainly of pregnancy-like reactions such as
nausea, gaining weight, and fluid retention.
A number of women also indicated reasons
related to the menstrual cycle: leg cramps,
dizziness, excessive bleeding. Many also
reported headaches and nervousness as
their reason for no longer using oral
contraceptives.

responses were then coded into three categories as has been done by Frank and
Tietze (1965, p. 122~127). First, discontinuation because of side effects; second,
discontinuation due to other use problems;
third, discontinuation for reasons not related to the pill. These categories were used
in the 1965 national survey. In the Rhode
Island study, 61.8% of those no longer
taking the pill cited side effects as principal reasons for their decision, and 10.8%
gave other reasons related to possible difficulties with the pill. Another 27.4% cited
nonrelated factors. In the 1965 study, the
respective proportions were 65%, 15%, and
20% (Ryder and Westoff, 1971, p. 157160).

The principal reason given for discon
than side effects) were given by a small
proportion who expressed fear of the effects

of the pill. They did not experience actual
physical side effects, but were likely to be
upset by the negative possibilities sometimes attributed to oral contraceptives.
Most of the 27.4% who discontinued for
reasons unassociated with the pill did so in
order to become pregnant. In fact, 17.6%
of all discontinuers cited this as their main
reason, which was a slightly higher proportion than the 15% noted in the 1965
survey.

Age, education, and religion were considered in analyzing the reasons given for
discontinuation. It must be realized that
these variables are themselves interrelated.
Younger women and non-Catholics, on the
average, are better educated. Thus the
results must consider this interaction effect
which cannot be controlled due to sample
size.

Women under 30 were much more likely
to give reasons not related to the pill than
those over that age. This is, of course, due
to the desire to become pregnant on the

‘part of younger women. Similarly, a direct

relation between education and the per cent
citing such reasons is noted. This relationship may also partially reflect the different
age structures. Non-Catholics are much
more likely to give such reasons than are
Catholics, and they are less likely to cite
reasons associated with the pill. That is,
Catholics are more apt to express a fear
of the pill. Non-Catholics, on the other
hand, in citing “to become pregnant” more
often show a tendency to be more pragmatic in their use of the pill. It is also
interesting to observe that no respondent
gave religious reasons for discontinuing.
The relations between education and religion and the reasons for discontinuing
partially explain the declining pattern of
use by the better educated and the nonCatholics. To a certain extent, this relationship reflects a “planned pregnancy at
Oral Contraceptives | 61

titude” on the part of the better educated
and the non-Catholics. These women have
apparently been using the pill quite adequately as a method of family limitation.
They may well return to it after the birth
of a child. However, those with less education and the Catholics tend to stop using
the pill for reasons associated with side
effects. This may, of course, result in more
“unplanned pregnancies.”

Irrespective of their replies to “Why did
you stop using it?”’, these same respondents
were asked: ‘Was your decision influenced
at all by the Senate hearings in Washington last winter?” That winter (1970) witnessed a great deal of publicity given to
the hearings under Senator Gaylord Nelson
of Wisconsin. The nightly news telecasts
seldom failed to give this investigation wide
coverage. Clinic records began showing that
large numbers of women were abandoning
the pill because of the unfavorable publicity resulting from the hearings. (Ross,
1970, p. 7). It was therefore suspected that
even if a woman gave a pill-related answer
to the question on discontinuation, this
news may have contributed to the decision.
One woman in eight (12.8%) indicated
that the hearings affected their decision to
quit (Table 10). The younger women and
those with more education were somewhat
more affected than the older and less educated. The relationship between religion
and the replies was not significant, though
non-Catholics were more affected than were
Catholics. These findings, while not very
significant, nevertheless support the earlier
suggestion that the diffusion process has
been at work on the better educated who
are apparently more aware of the possible
difficulties with oral contraception.

CONCLUSIONS
Between 1967 and 1969 there was a decline in the number of Rhode Island women
using oral contraceptives and this was es

pecially true of those under age 30. Those
with at least a high school education were
apparently discontinuing more than those
with less schooling. Non-Catholics were
more apt to discontinue its use than were
Catholics. However, non-Catholics and the
better educated still used the pill more than
the other respondents. The panel investigation further supported this general tendency in that the dropout rates were higher
for the college educated and for the nonCatholics. However, these groups had also
used oral contraceptives more in the past
than those with less education and the
Catholics. Generally, the findings suggest
a developing disenchantment with the pill
among the non-Catholics and the better
educated.

A majority of all the women who had
stopped using the pill cited side effects as
the main reason for their decision, but
almost one in five stopped using the pill
to become pregnant. As this was especially
true of the non-Catholics and the better
educated, it partially explained the earlier
results bearing on changes in pill usage.
It also suggested that these women are
better family planners in that the reasons
for discontinuation are more “rational,”
while those of the less educated and the
Catholics tend to be concerned with side

effects and indicate that perhaps their family planning techniques are not as well
“planned.”

These general findings, based on a small
number of cases in a predominantly Catholic state, may or may not be indicative
of recent changes in the behavior of American women. Earlier studies have suggested
that Rhode Island has been in the forefront
of demographic changes (Goldstein and
Mayer, 1963, p. 6). If this is true in this
case, then perhaps the proportion of users
of oral contraceptives throughout the nation has declined after reaching a peak
around 1967. Further investigations on a
larger scale are certainly warranted from
the suggestions that emanate from this report. Furthermore, a subsequent report on
the 1971 follow-up survey of the Rhode
Island population will be forthcoming in
the near future and this should shed additional light on the possibility of a continuing decline in the use of the pill.
