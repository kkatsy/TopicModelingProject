Discussion: Migration of Blacks

Dr. Himes takes as his beginning point
a commonly accepted assumption that
“in-migration causes urban problems.” His
paper adequately demonstrates that most
black urban growth is a result of natural
increase (the excess of births over deaths),
rather than the result of in-migration. He
points out that the estimates of migration
for 1969 to 1970, given by the Current
Population Survey, indicate a change in
the trend of declining out-migration from
the South by blacks. While the total number of blacks in the South has continued
to increase, the number of blacks in the
rural South, and especially in the rural
farm segments of the South, has shown
marked decline. To the extent that black
migration to northern metropolitan areas
arises in the rural South, the base of this
migration is decreasing, and it is inevitable
that the total volume of this migration will
decrease, even though the 1969 to 1970
period may indicate a temporary change
in trend.

Dr. Himes suggests that the high educational level of black migrants may be a
consequence of a younger age. To some
extent this is the case, although even within
narrow age groups the out-migrants are
better educated than are the nonmigrants.
Age, in and of itself, does not explain the
higher educational level of the migrants.

 

The assumption that “in-migration causes
urban problems” is not an essential part
of the paper, although, apparently, was
part of the motivation for doing the research, Recent research findings indicate
that this assumption is not well-founded.
Black in-migrants in northern urban areas
have higher incomes than do the black
urban residents of urban origin in these
areas. This is true even when in-migrants
are restricted to those who came from
the rural South. Among black males these
in-migrants to northern urban areas from
the rural South have smaller proportions
receiving welfare assistance than do those
black male urban residents of urban origin. The Kerner Commission Report indicates that those blacks involved in the
riots were more likely to be of local urban
birth than to have come from the South.
All of these findings indicate that the
prevalent, stereotyped view of black migrants from the rural South to the urban
North being individuals who are moving
in order to receive higher welfare payments
does not have a basis in fact. This is not
to say that these individuals are all out
of poverty and doing well, but simply to
point out that being black urban residents
of rural origin is no more disadvantaging
than just being a black urban resident.
Programs designed to “keep them down

on the farm” or to aid the adjustment of
migrants to urban areas are not likely to
have much impact on urban problems. The
entire situation of blacks in urban areas
must be attacked rather than the situation of rural in-migrants.

More intensive study of urban blacks
who have done well might be rewarding.
What are the characteristics of those urban blacks who have “made it” as compared with those who are in poverty?
Washington, D.C., with a preponderantly
black residential population, has one of
the highest median incomes of any city
in the country. In a study of migrants
from Yazoo County, Mississippi, to Chicago, Illinois, we found that 15% had
incomes of $8,000.00 a year or higher.
The stereotype of all blacks in metropolitan areas being in poverty is not true,
even though it is obvious that tremendous
progress must yet be made.

I would like to comment on one point
made by Dr. Reynolds Farley. Dr. Farley

pointed out that if we look at the school
enrollment of individuals aged 18 to 24,
we find that the differential between whites
and blacks has increased between 1957
and 1970. This is the case, of course. Both
groups have increased the proportion of
18-to-24-year-olds enrolled in school, but
the increase among whites has been greater
than that among blacks. However, looking
at this year by year shows that the gap
widened steadily from 1957 to 1966 and
has been narrowing somewhat between
1966 and 1970. Interestingly enough, the
reduction in gap has been due to a slackening of the enrollment of whites rather
than any change in the trend of enrollment
rate among blacks. This slackening of the
increasing enrollment rates of whites 18
to 24 years of age began in 1966, and it
is interesting to speculate whether this is
related to the draft situation or to the
increasing drop-out rate of whites in protest of the Establishment.
