ABSTRACT; Two surveys designed to appraise fecundity and mortality were carried out in Morocco it} 1983 and 1984, on samples of 3,000 and 5,000 women, respectively, in the city and in
the province of Marrakech. Infant mortality was studied using the biometric method of
J. Bottrgevis-Pichat. The first results presented in this article highlight the absence of excess
exdgenous mortality among women under thirty years of age living in a provincial urban environment and among women from the city of Matrakech whose husbands are employed in service activities. These results are discussed in relation to the socioeconomic backgrounds of the

sample families.

For some years tesearch conducted
by demiographers in industrialized countries has confirmed the already widesptead opinion that infant mortality can
no longer be considered as an indicator
of economic and social development
(Hohn, 1981). A recent study (Lantoine
atid Pressat, 1984) even shows a development of the internal structure of infant mortality, which is exptessed in the
spread of eridogenous deaths during the
first year of life and even later. Moreover, these results challenge the biomettic method set up by J. Bourgeois-Pichat
to separate endogenous from exogenous deaths.

However, in developing countries
and in spite of the variety of demographic transition processes, infant mortality rates still remain at a high level.
Bourgeois-Pichat’s law can only be applied imperfectly, and one can note the
appearance of excess exogenous mortal
ity starting between the third and the
ninth month depending on the countries
or regions.

In this study, based on research carried out in Morocco over several years,
we set out to provide some elements for
teflection on the recent developments in
this phenomenon.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The results presented are from two
retrospective surveys conducted in 1983,
and 1984. The aim of both was to supply
quantitative information on fecundity
and mortality in relation to various
forms of cultural behavior ard to economic and social conditions. Three
thousand women teplied to a questionnaire in the twenty health centers of the
city of Marrakech in 1983. The following
year, a similar questionnaire was presented to five thousand women from the

province of Marrakech, excluding the
city.

In order to appraise the structure of
infant mortality and because of a lack of
precise statistics concerning the causes
of death, we used J. Bourgeois-Pichat’s
biometric method, which enables one to
separate endogenous deaths (due to
causes prior to birth or resulting from
the birth itself) from exogenous deaths
(caused by factors depending on the
child’s social environment). This
method consists in grouping the deaths
from zero to twelve months according to
a logarithmic scale of age with the form
Log? (n + 1), being the age in days.
When the graphic adjustment of the
grouped deaths is appropriate, a straight
line is obtained. Its intersection with the
axis of the ordinates give us the value of
the endogenous deaths. The exogenous
deaths are obtained by subtraction from
the total.

RESULTS

For the two surveys as a whole, the
results of the distribution and structure
of infant mortality agreed quite closely
with those found in African countries
where similar studies have been made
(Bchir, 1967; Cantrelle, 1969; Abdou,
1972; Tabutin, 1976). In the city of Marrakech and in the urban sectors of the
province, the most striking aspect is the
presence of excess exogenous mortality
(or exceptional exogenous mortality)
from the fourth month onward, a phenomenon which is more pronounced
among female children. In rural areas,
excess mortality is still to be found but
appears later, around the eighth or ninth
month.

However, two elements appear to reveal a new trend in the structure of infant mortality. Indeed, in the city of

Marrakech, a differential analysis according to the socioprofessional category of the head of the family highlights
an absence of excess exogenous mortality when that person is employed in the
tertiary sector.‘ In urban areas of the
province, we notice the same phenomenon in the case of women under thirty
years of age. The divergences observed
do not appear to be ascribable to the
nature of the study, even though errors
or omissions may be frequent in retrospective surveys. Indeed, they were
kept to a minimum by employing medical staff trained for the needs of such a
survey. Moreover, a study on Senegal
(Lecomte-Enselme, 1984) shows that in
the field of fecundity there 1s excellent
agreement between data collected in
retrospective surveys and that of repeated demographic surveys.

These results are worthy of some development. For the city of Marrakech
(cf. Table 1), we notice that women
from the tertiary sector are the youngest, those who married the latest, and
whose husbands are the least often polygamous. They are more likely to give
birth in hospitals and breastfeed for a
shorter length of time. They belong to
the households with the largest number
of incomes, though the number of persons per household is relatively low and
their homes are the most likely to be
equipped with lighting and running water. Inversely, the categories “manual
workers”? and “‘miscellaneous”’ which
seem to have the least favorable living
conditions and the most traditional behavior are also those in which the per
In this work we have defined the tertiary sector as all service activities excluding trade and
craftwork. The most frequent tertiary occupations
are to be found in the administrative civil service,
teaching, the army, and the police force.

exogenous mortality are the highest. In
the province (cf. Table 2) we note that
excess exogenous mortality starts either
at four to five months or around the
ninth month. In the latter case, the per

tality is found among women under
thirty and for all women from an urban
environment.

From this brief analysis, we are able

_ to formulate two conclusions. First of

all, we are led to recognize the link between the level of exogenous mortality
and the standard of living of the populations. In the city, exogenous mortality

varies according to the occupation of the .

head of the family, an important factor
in estimating its economic level. In the
province one can assume that the standard of living of women from urban areas
is higher than in the country. Moreover,
small urban centers benefit from a larger
infrastructure with easier access to medical care. We should point out, however,
that our results do not have a general
value applicable to other African countries where differences in mortality are
sometimes due far more to cultural behavior (Hill and Randall, 1984). Secondly, we note a decrease in mortality

among young women. This result is certainly closely linked to the general improvement of living conditions in Morocco over the last two decades. It is
therefore reasonable to consider that we
are witnessing a demographic transition
period, the effects of which have an impact on the level and structure of infant
mortality. This seems to us the most
likely explanation for the absence of excess exogenous mortality in the fraction
of the population which is both the
youngest and the best provided for in economic terms.
