Demographic and Social Consequences
of Various Causes of Death in the

United States

Diseases affect societies in a wide variety
of ways. It has been argued that they have
influenced the outcome of military and
political struggles (Zinsser, 1935; Shrewsbury, 1964), helped to establish the prevailing literary tone and preoccupations
of a generation (Dubos, 1959), determined attitudes and norms regarding the
expression of bodily instincts and promiscunity (Lawrence, 1956), and altered a
population’s incentives for resorting to
supernatural explanations (Blauner, 1966).
Unquestionably, they have influenced the
duration of human life, the durability and
extent of kinship ties, the sex ratio in populations, and the monetary “value” of a
human life.

Perhaps most important has been the
impact of diseases on population size and
growth rates. It is not unreasonable to
suggest that the population of England
and Wales would be larger by some 25 to
30 per cent today were it not for the
growth-inhibiting influence of respiratory
tuberculosis in the nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries.1 The sudden reduction

of mortality from such causes of death as
malaria and smallpox has, of course,
created the condition of rapid population
growth that today prevails in most of the
less-developed world.

This paper examines the social and
demographic impact of selected causes of
death in a contemporary low mortality
country, the United States. It may be

tion growth rates is closely approximated by formula (1) in the text. When this formula is
applied to data from England decenially from
1861 to 1921, the reduction in annual female
growth rates due to deaths from tuberculosis is
evaluated as 0.00267, 0.00229, 0.00173, 0.00143,
0.00105, 0.00084, and 0.00078 (Preston et al,
1972). A mean age at childbearing of thirty years
is used. Assuming that the first figure applies to
the previous sixty-year period and that each
subsequent figure applies to the preceding tenyear period, the cumulative impact on population
size in 1921 and subsequently is 25.7 per cent.
That is, the population of 1921 and beyond
would have been approximately 26 per cent larger
than it actually was if death rates from respiratory
tuberculosis had been zero for the period 18011921. An alternative cruder calculation (formula
[2]) is simply the exponential of the cumulative
crude death rates from tuberculosis during the
period. Making the same assumption, that rates
are constant during some preceding period, we
find that the population of 1921 would have
been 27.3 per cent larger without respiratory tuberculosis. Both calculations assume that modifying mortality rates would have had no impact on
fertility or migration rates.

widely believed that death rates have fallen
to such low levels that the influence of
mortality from individual causes is trivial,
but this is not the case. For example, with
crude birth rates around 18/1000 and
death rates around 9/1000, the typical
Western country could increase its shortterm growth rate by a factor of up to two
through further advances against mortality. Furthermore, effects on age composition and on such related factors as birth
rates and per capita income are likely to
be greater when mortality declines from a
low as opposed to a high level, since such
declines are necessarily heavily concentrated in the span of ages above 50.

The procedure is straightforward. To
gauge the impact of a cause of death on
population structure, we compare population projections made under the assumption that the cause is absent to those projections made under the assumption that
it is present. The projections merely serve
the purpose of indicating the effect of a
cause on future population and can in no
way be interpreted as predictions. The fictional quality is assured by assuming that
a cause of death is eliminated instantaneously, rather than at an arbitrary pace
over some course of years. However, it is
important to note for analytic purposes
that, whatever the pace, complete elimination of a cause of death would eventually
produce identical characteristics in the
projected population, with the sole exception of population size. This result is a
consequence of the weak ergodic property
of population movements through time
(Lopez, 1961; McFarland, 1969).

The causes of death we shall examine
are: all infectious and parasitic diseases,
including influenza and pneumonia (B117, 30-32, 36, 40 in the Seventh Revision
of the International List of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death); malignant
and benign neoplasms (B18-19); cardio
Consequences of Causes of Death

145

vascular disease (B22, 24-29; A85, 86);
and accidents and violence (BE47-50).
Each cause is examined with respect to its
subsequent impact on population size,
growth rate, age-sex composition, kinship
ties, retirement age, and per capita income.
It is hoped that the results of this investigation may, among other things, fill in a
part of the background against which
health policy decisions are made.

Persons “saved” from death due to a
particular cause at some age will be exposed at all subsequent ages to the recorded United States schedules of birth
rates and of death rates from other causes.
Thus, we assume independence between
age-specific birth and death rates and
among age-specific death rates from the
several causes of death. These assumptions
are undoubtedly not completely accurate,
but it is difficult to say in what direction
they err. For example, death rates from
infectious diseases are higher in lower social classes. Eliminating deaths from this
cause may be expected to increase disproportionately the numbers in these lower
classes, thus elevating birth rates. However, the persons “saved” may perhaps be
among the less robust of their cohort and
less likely to marry or to experience unimpaired fecundity. The assumption of independence among causes of death is likewise
subject to error, but the errors unquestionably operate in both directions and the net
effect cannot be appraised without much
more effort than has thus far been expended on estimating empirically the size
of interdependencies.

The projection procedure employed here
differs from the traditional approach to
studying the consequences of mortality
variation, which focuses on changes in a
cohort followed through life (eg., Enke
and Brown, 1972; Fuchs, 1966). While
such an approach is useful, it is incomplete,
since it takes no account either of the ini

146

tial population structure or of the impact
of mortality change on numbers of births.
Thus, it neglects changing relations among
cohorts. Mortality decline can only “age”
a cohort; but an actual population is frequently rejuvenated through the impact
on births of such declines (Hermalin,
1966).

UNITED STATES LIFE TABLES WITH
VARIOUS CAUSES OF DEATH
ELIMINATED

The latest year for which cause-of-death
life tables have been computed for the
United States is 1964 (Preston et al., 1972,
pp. 768-71). Official U.S. life tables for
1969-71 will not be available for several
years. Fortunately for our purposes, the
mortality profile of the population is subject to quite small annual variation. For
example, the life expectancy at birth in the
1964 life tables was 66.9 for males and
73.6 for females, while in 1968 the figures
were 66.6 and 74.0 (U.S. National Center
for Health Statistics, n.d., pp. 5-7). There
would appear to be minimal loss in using
the 1964 tables even if we choose the base
year of the projections to be somewhat
later.

The survivorship columns in the various
life tables for the United States population
of 1964 are displayed in Table 1. To repeat, the basic assumption underlying
these calculations is that the elimination
of a cause of death would leave unaltered
the force of mortality function (set of
death rates at exact ages) for all other
causes of death combined. The iterative
technique developed by Nathan Keyfitz
is utilized (Preston et al., 1972).

Additional information is introduced for
ages over 85, since more than half of the
population would survive to that age were
cardiovascular disease to be eliminated. In
the life tables for all causes combined, I

Preston

use survivorship proportions over age 85
appearing in the official U.S. life tables for
1959-61 (U.S. National Center for Health
Statistics, 1964). These calculations were
based in turn upon the survival experience
of Civil War veterans. For the other tables,
the official figures were combined with data
on the cause-distribution of deaths in age
intervals above 85 in 1964 (U.S. National
Center for Health Statistics, 1966).

Following Chiang (1968), I assume for
these ages that the ratio of the force of
mortality function from the cause eliminated to that from all other causes combined is constant within each five-year interval. This assumption is adopted for
convenience since it permits a modification
of the “all cause” table that relies completely on the ratio of deaths from the
cause eliminated to deaths from all causes.
Direct use of the cause-specific rates above
age 85 is rejected because of the likelihood
of large errors due to age misreporting.

FEMALE DOMINANT PROJECTIONS
WITH CONSTANT FERTILITY

All projections use a base year of 1969.
This is the latest year for which age-specific birth rates for males and females have
been published (U.S. National Center for
Health Statistics, 1973). The age-sex distribution of the population in 1969 is derived from the U.S. Bureau of Census
(1970).

The sex ratio of births in the year was
1.0530, and this ratio is assumed to be constant throughout the projection period.
The life tables shown in Table 1 are used
throughout each set of projections. Zero
net migration into each age interval is assumed throughout the projection period.
This assumption is made partly for convenience and partly from a desire to derive
the implications of mortality decline for

The basic set of projections assumes that
the age-specific female fertility rates of
1969 remain constant throughout the projection period. The total fertility rate for
1969 was 2.46. Although fertility has declined since 1969, the factors in the decline
may well be transitory; the total fertility

effect on a modem country’s intrinsic
growth rate—the steady-state growth rate
that would ultimately be produced by the
indefinite continuance of a given regime of
age-specific mortality and fertility rates
(Coale, 1959). It has been shown that the
gain in the intrinsic growth rate from a
reduction in mortality is closely approximated by the average decline in the force
of mortality function between ages zero
and Az, the mean age of childbearing in
the stable population (Preston, 1974).
Since mortality from any of the causes
considered is relatively low prior to Az, or
indeed prior to the end of the childbearing
period itself, the gain in the intrinsic
growth rate is necessarily quite small. The
largest gain results from the elimination
of violence (-+ 0.00024) and the smallest
from the elimination of cardiovascular disease (-++ 0.00005), even though the gain in
female life expectancy is roughly ten times
greater for cardiovascular disease. In both
cases, the effects on intrinsic growth rates
are minor, and if we were to examine only
this index, the effects of mortality reduction would appear inconsequential.
However, this indicator can be quite
misleading for developments in the short
term. The increase in the instantaneous
growth rate from eliminating a cause of
death is simply equal to the crude death
rate from that cause, which of course comprises events at ages after as well as before
the end of childbearing. The difference is
obvious from the following formulas:

u,(¢) = death rate from cause i at age ¢,

c(t) = proportion of the observed population at age ¢,

Ap = average age of mother at childbirth in the stable population
corresponding to observed ageschedules of mortality and fertility.

Both changes are averages of age-specific
rates of death from cause 7. The change in
intrinsic growth rates is an (unweighted)
average of death rates between birth and
Ay; the change in instantaneous growth
rates is a (population weighted) average
of death rates at all ages.

Although cardiovascular disease has the
least impact on intrinsic growth rates, it
has the largest impact on population size
through the first several centuries of projection. After eighty years, the population
without cardiovascular disease is 11.8 per
cent larger than the population with all
causes of death present. In fact, the gain
in population size from eliminating cardiovascular disease is at least double that
from eliminating any other cause of death
throughout the first century of projections.
Cardiovascular disease has a trivial effect
on annual arrivals at age 50 but a major
effect on the numbers surviving beyond
that point, and population size at a point
in time depends upon both quantities.

A large majority of the gain in population size from eliminating cardiovascular
disease or cancer is realized within the first
thirty years of the projection period. By
1999, the population is 8.8 per cent Jarger
with no cardiovascular disease and 2.2 per
cent larger with no cancer, compared to
11.8 per cent and 3.1 per cent larger after
eighty years. In contrast to the time pattern of impact from eliminating these two
chronic diseases, most of the relative
growth from eliminating the other causes

of death occurs after 1999. This difference
results from the somewhat younger ageincidence of death from the other causes,
reflected in a roundabout way in Table 1.

The relative increase from eliminating
infectious and parasitic diseases or violence is 0.8 per cent and 1.6 per cent
by 1999, compared to 1.7 per cent and
3.2 per cent by 2049. Here, the additions
to population act cumulatively, through
births. In the case of the chronic diseases,
they are essentially once-and-for-all gains
at the older ages. The situation is analogous to increasing the volume of liquid in
a container either by adding in the contents of another container or by turning up
the tap slightly. Eventually, of course, population size with deaths of violence eliminated exceeds that of any other projection;
but the date when this occurs is so distant
as to be well beyond any realistic planning
horizon.

The accompanying graph (Fig. 1) displays the time sequence of growth rates for
the various projections. Growth is most
rapid in the “no-cardiovascular” projection
during the first thirty years, but its position changes rapidly thereafter and “noviolence” takes the lead. The no-cardiovascular series then shows a second period of
relatively rapid growth, peaking around
2034. This oscillatory pattern is not a necessary outcome, but rather is a product of
coincidence. In 2034, people 75 to 90 years
old, the principal beneficiaries of cardiovascular elimination, are members of the
exceptionally large birth cohorts of 1944—
59. Compared to the other projections,
where the advantage at 75-90 is not so
great, growth is quite rapid. Fifteen years
later, this group is dying in the no-cardiovascular projection and its growth is exceptionally slow.

While the steady-state growth rates differ little among the projections, the growth
rates are attained with quite different combinations of birth and death rates, Intrin
 

Preston

sic birth and death rates are within 5 per
cent of the “all cause” figures in the case
of cancer, infectious and parasitic diseases,
and violence. However, when cardiovascular disease is eliminated, the birth rate falls
by 9 per cent and the death rate by 17 per
cent, reflecting the shifts in age composition that have been induced.

AGE DISTRIBUTION

From the preceding discussion it is obvious that the elimination of cardiovascular disease or cancer produces an older
population, After thirty years, the proportion over age 65 has increased by 62 per
cent (cardiovascular) and 12 per cent
(cancer), and in the steady state it has
grown by 65 per cent and 13 per cent.
Thus, the largest portion of the aging that
will ultimately occur is realized in a rather
short length of time. This rapid adjustment is, once again, a consequence of the
minor impact of these diseases on numbers
of births. Most of the relative growth of
the older population occurs at the expense
of those members 15-64 rather than of
those 0-14, The proportion aged 0-14 falls
by 0.006 (cancer) and 0.024 (cardiovascular) in the steady state, while the proportion aged 15-64 falls by 0.009 and 0.054.

Perhaps more surprising than the aging
of the no-cardiovascular and no-cancer
populations is the fact that the elimination
of infectious and parasitic diseases or violence also serves to age the population, although by relatively minor amounts. In the
steady state, the proportion over age 65
grows by 0.002 (infectious) and 0.003
(violence). During the twentieth century,
mortality declines in the United States
have produced a slightly younger population (Hermalin, 1966). For the most part,
these mortality reductions are attributable
to declining death rates from infectious
and parasitic diseases, which had a relatively young age incidence at the beginning of this century. But the age-incidence

of those infectious deaths which remain
(principally, influenza and pneumonia) is
sufficiently old that further advances
against even this group of causes are
clearly unlikely to rejuvenate the population.

Abrupt changes in age composition such
as produced by the elimination of cardiovascular disease or cancer could be expected to induce social, economic, and
political adjustments. Some of these have

been outlined in connection with discussions of the desirability of fertility declines (Coale, 1968; Sauvy, 1969, pp.
303-19). Among the most direct and concrete are implications for retirement systems. Many of these, including the federal
retirement system administered by the
Social Security Administration, operate in
large part on a pay-as-you-go basis, so
that the taxes on income of current labor
force members finance the benefits of those

currently retired. Any substantial aging
of the population could be expected to
place heavy strains on such systems, which
in turn may act to decelerate the trend
toward earlier retirement.

To indicate the extent of adjustment
required, we calculate the age, x, that satisfies the following formula:

 

p(-»
il — Pes+
(—i) Dp.”

Pisy Past

where
P‘— = number of persons above age @
in the population with cause of
death 7 eliminated

Thus, x is the age in a population with
cause 7 eliminated that divides the population above age 15 in the same proportion
as age 65 divides the population in which
all causes are still present. It is close to
the new retirement age required to keep
constant the ratio of the retired to the economically active. For the male stable population with cancer eliminated, this age is
66.7; for cardiovascular disease, it is 75.0.
That is, to keep the same relationship between numbers of adults above and below
retirement age, it would be necessary to
increase the age at retirement by approximately two years if cancer were eliminated
and by approximately ten years if cardiovascular disease were eliminated. To the
extent that such changes failed to materialize, the incomes of the retired would
be diminished or the contributions of
workers to retirement systems would have
to increase.

SEX RATIO

The sex ratio for all ages combined
changes very little as a result of the projected mortality changes. In none of the
projection years for any cause of death
considered does the ratio of males to females change by as much as 2 per cent.
The elimination of violence, a heavily

Social Biology

male-specific cause of death, produces the
largest effect, raising the sex ratio by 1.9
per cent in the steady state.

The relative invariance of the sex ratio
is somewhat misleading because it reflects
contrary tendencies. The sex ratio at every
age past zero rises from the elimination of
each cause of death (except cancer between
ages 35 and 60), but in every case the
population becomes older, resulting in
greater weight for the ages with low sex
ratios. However, the overall sex ratio is
surely less significant in social affairs than
the sex ratio at particular ages, and the
age-specific changes are quite large, particularly at the older ages.

In the steady state, the ratio of males
to females in the age interval 65-69 has
grown by 15.0 per cent from the elimination of cardiovascular disease, 4.7 per
cent from violence, 2.1 per cent from cancer and 1.1 per cent from infectious and
parasitic diseases. These changes are a consequence of the greater rates of male than
female mortality from the eliminated
causes at prior ages. The sex ratio in a
closed cohort at a particular age may be
expressed as:

Me, My ede HMDA
ee flere

— SRB - —S [wi (¢) — wF(t) Jat

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 21, No. 2

SRB = sex ratio at birth in the
cohort.

Thus, the elimination of cause i increases
the sex ratio at age x by the exponential
of the difference between male and female
death rates from that cause cumulated
over all prior ages. If the cumulative difference is positive (male rates exceeding
female), the sex ratio increases, even if
that difference is absolutely or relatively
less than the corresponding difference for
all other causes combined. Since the male
death rate exceeds the female for all ages
and causes considered (except neoplasms
at ages 30-50), the elimination of a cause
almost invariably raises the sex ratio at
a particular age. For the older ages, in
particular, a greater numerical equality
of the sexes would be one of the most important benefits of progress against these
causes of death, a benefit likely to be reinforced by the physical changes in the older
population produced by the reduction of
chronic afflictions.

KINSHIP TIES

We examine here the effect of eliminating a cause of death on two types of kin
Consequences of Causes of Death 153

ship relationships: lineal progenitors and
spouses. We exclude siblings, offspring,
aunts, uncles, and cousins because the extent of these relationships depends not
only upon the Jevel of fertility and mortality in a population but also on the
distribution of children ever born among
families and the pattern of childspacing.
Calculation becomes exceedingly cumbersome, and some of the required information is not available for the United States
population.

The probability that a person of a particular age has a living lineal progenitor
of a particular type (father, mother, paternal grandfather, maternal grandmother,
etc.) is a function of the ages of parents
at childbearing and of mortality rates beyond those ages. A change in mortality
rates affects both of these elements, although the change in ages at childbearing
tends to be trivial for the cases discussed
here, since population age composition is
altered very little prior to the upper age
of childbearing. Following Goodman and
Keyfitz (unpublished), we can estimate
the proportion of persons at a particular
age with a living progenitor in the steady
state as follows:

Proportion with living mother = 44,(a) = Si Bo(a ++ x)m(xje—"dx

Basic assumptions of these formulas are
that survivorship is not conditioned by
parenthood status and that survivorship is

the various assumptions regarding mortality. Calculations referring to male progenitors employ male fertility rates of the
U.S. population in 1969 (U.S. National
Center for Health Statistics, 1973), scaled
down by the factor, constant with age,
required for the male intrinsic growth rate
to equal the female.

Undoubtedly the most important categories in the table are the proportions of
persons with a living parent. For male
progenitors, the impact of eliminating cardiovascular disease exceeds that for cancer
at all ages and for all relationships. The
proportion of persons aged 20 with a living

age 20. Although cardiovascular disease
has a much greater impact on female life
expectancy, cancer death rates are higher
in the age interval 25-50 for women
(Preston et al., 1972, p. 720). These latter
are the crucial ages for orphanhood.
Eliminating cancer would reduce the probability of having a dead mother by 23
per cent for children aged 10 and by 29
per cent for persons aged 20. Even though
the duration and disagreeableness of cancer tends to inflate estimates of its importance relative to cardiovascular disease,
it nonetheless exerts an important influence on maternal survivorship.

Vol. 21, No. 2

Although the survivorship of parents of
young children would seem to have the
greatest social significance, all forms of
survivorship in the table are salient because of the responsibilities which one
generation undertakes on behalf of another. As the relationship moves through
time and age, such responsibility typically
shifts from the older onto the younger
person. In this respect, it is awesome to
contemplate that, if cardiovascular disease
were eliminated, approximately 60 per
cent of persons aged 60 would still have
a living mother, and 38 per cent a living
father. A living parent for a 60-year-old
means a living grandparent for a 30-yearold and a living great-grandparent for an
infant, prospective developments which are
equally apparent in Table 3. At age 80,
14 per cent would still have at least one
parent living, assuming independence of
fathers’ and mothers’ survival. The most
obvious consequence is that the typical
individual would be sandwiched between
the two adjacent generations for a much
longer period of life.

Turning to the survivorship of marriages, we encounter immediately the
“problem of the sexes” for which no sat
 

Causes of Death

Consequences of

isfactory solution has yet been found. The
problem from the perspective of this study
is that alterations in mortality will change
age distributions and that age-specific
marriage rates for males and females in
the United States in 1969, when applied
to these new age distributions, will produce
a different number of males than females
marrying. We cannot predict satisfactorily
steady-state marriage patterns without
a complex and as yet unverified marriage
function. However, we can calculate the
probabilities of marital survivorship for
couples marrying at particular ages under
the old and new mortality regimes and
progress from there to a very approximate
calculation for the population as a whole.

Table 4 displays the survivorship experience of couples married at specified
ages, based upon the cause-of-death life
tables. The factor of divorce is ignored;
the probabilities are most properly interpreted as the chance that both male
and female partners to a marriage will be
alive after x years, regardless of whether
they are still married to one another. Because the survivorship of both partners is
by definition a function of joint survival,
the elimination of a cause tends to have a

greater impact at a particular “duration”

than in the previous case. This impact increases both with age at marriage and with
duration of marriage, as the scope for mortality intervention widens.

Of 1,000 marriages which both partners
contract at the age of 30, 62 more will
survive 30 years if cancer is eliminated,
and 120 more will survive this period if
cardiovascular disease is eliminated. In
this case, one is not forced to examine
only the very high ages for impressive effects. As in the preceding table, the elimination of cardiovascular disease has a
substantially greater impact than that of
cancer, except at the shortest durations.
With no deaths from cardiovascular disease, 62.8 per cent of those marriages contracted by people at age 20 would have
both partners alive to celebrate their fiftieth anniversary and 42.0 per cent, their
sixtieth, the latter representing more than
a three-fold increase. It can be seen from
Table 4 that eliminating cancer or cardiovascular disease has an effect on marital
survivorship roughly equivalent to both
partners marrying at an age five or ten
years younger, respectively.

One almost certain consequence of this
improved marital survivorship is an increase in the proportion of marriages ending in divorce. Such an increase follows on
formal grounds alone. In a situation of
competing risks, when one risk function
declines, the proportion of a cohort ultimately succumbing to the other risk
must increase if that risk function itself
is unchanged. There is also a possibility
that reduced mortality would increase the
divorce risk function itself (divorce rate
as a function of marital duration), since
a forward-looking spouse could anticipate
unpleasant circumstances lasting longer if
left to the natural course of events.

Despite reducing proportions widowed
at each age, the elimination of these dis
Preston

Social Biology

eases scarcely changes the proportion for
all ages combined. The age-specific reduction is largely offset by the older age
structure of the population. Put another
way, a smaller proportion becomes widowed at each age, but those widows produced live longer on the average. The
effect can be illustrated by assuming that
all persons of both sexes marry at age 25,
calculating the proportions widowed at
each subsequent age, and weighting these
proportions by the population’s age distribution. Since widowhood is virtually
nonexistent between ages 20 and 25, the
results also give an accurate indication
of proportions widowed if all marry at 20,
or at any combination of ages between 20
and 25.

In the steady-state population with all
causes of death present, the ever-widowed
as a proportion of the total population is
0.195 for females and 0.101 for males.
The impact of eliminating various causes
on these figures is relatively minor, as can
be seen in Table 5. For females, the largest
reduction in the prevalence of widowhood
results from removing violence as a cause
of death, since this cause is heavily malespecific and its removal has little effect on
the female age distribution. Many more
husbands are “saved” when cardiovascular

disease is eliminated, but such widows as
there are tend to live much longer, with
relatively little net effect on the prevalence
of widowhood. In fact, the elimination of
cardiovascular disease for both sexes raises
the proportion of males who are widowed;
the age-structural term dominates. In general, we reach the somewhat surprising
conclusion that eliminating these diseases
would have minor effects on the prevalence
of widowhood, and in one case would even
serve to raise it.

EFFECT ON PER CAPITA INCOME

Attempts to assess the economic value
of eliminating deaths from a disease have
a long history. Certainly the most important component of the calculation is
the value that people place on their own
lives or on those of close relatives; but
this element is usually neglected because
of its attendant measurement problems.
Instead, analysis has focused on estimating
the future productive contribution of the
persons hypothetically “saved” (Cohen
has reviewed various “production” approaches, unpublished). This approach
generally ignores the fact that more persons are alive to share the fruits of production and that per capita production
may actually fall. If it were applied to the
analysis of births, the results would be
vigorously pronatalist, despite the nearly
unanimous opinion of economists (using
more sophisticated models) that higher
fertility reduces economic well-being. The
“production” approach to mortality reduction also neglects the fact that some
of those “saved” will have offspring who
will also become producers and consumers.

These omissions can be corrected by
population projection in which persons of
different ages at a particular time are
weighted by an age-schedule of production
or earnings. A complete account would
consider such matters as the impact of

Consequences of Causes of Death

157

the new members on savings and the degree of diminishing returns to labor (Barlow, 1968). However, the approach here
will assume that added members produce
at the average rate recorded for members
of the population at the same age.

We are primarily interested in the ratio

Thus, K‘~® is the ratio of per capita income in the population with cause 7 eliminated to that with all causes present. The

violence is to change per capita income at

future dates by no more than I per cent.
Eliminating violence has a small positive
effect (in large part because of a relative
increase in numbers of males), and a small
negative effect occurs in the other two instances. Only when cardiovascular disease
is eliminated does per capita income
change by more than 1 per cent; in this
case it declines by 5.3 per cent in the
steady state. Even this may seem a surprisingly small change in view of the
massive changes in age distribution produced. However, the higher proportion in
the retirement ages is largely offset in its
effects by the higher ratio of males to
females in the working ages and by an
increase in the proportion of the population in the later, highly productive working ages. Moreover, the effects are smaller
in the short term, which receives greatest
weight in policy considerations, After ten
years, per capita income is only 1.6 per
cent lower in the no-cardiovascular projection. Differences of 2 per cent or even
5 per cent can be compensated for by one
year of exceptional economic growth. In
general, the conclusion must be that disease elimination has quite minor effects
on per capita income, effects that are
surely trivial in comparison to the value
that people place on their own lives.

MALE-DOMINANT PROJECTIONS

Tests were performed on the sensitivity
of the results with respect to two under
lying assumptions: female dominance in
fertility, and the constancy of fertility. A
second set of projections were prepared in
which male fertility was constant at its
1969 level. Both male and female births
are derived by applying these male fertility rates to the male age distribution and
assuming a constant sex ratio of births.
Whether the male- or female-dominant
projections yield more reliable predictions
depends on the resolution of the problem
of the sexes alluded to earlier. If births
are more sensitive to the number of males
in the population than to the number of
females, the male-dominant projections
provide the more appropriate predictions.

Dominance does make a large difference
for future population size, as indicated in
Table 7, but a rather small difference for
the consequences of eliminating a particuJar cause of death. The elimination of a
cause produces a somewhat larger increment in intrinsic growth rates in the maledominant projections. This larger increment
is a consequence of two factors. In terms
of the previous formula for the change in
intrinsic growth rates, w,* is somewhat
higher for males than for females, and Ap
is also somewhat higher (childbearing is
older). Since wz’ tends to rise with age, an
older Ag produces a larger increment to
intrinsic growth rates. If men were aged
60 at the birth of their children and women
aged 30, for example, the growth consequences of eliminating cardiovascular dis

ease would be radically different in the two
sets of projections.

In reality, the differences are rather
minor. The order of causes of death with
respect to their influence on the intrinsic
growth rate is identical in the two sets
of projections. Male dominance has the
principal effect of reinforcing the incremental growth caused by eliminating violence, a cause that is heavily male-specific
and that is quite active prior to the end of
the fertile period. After eighty years, the
population without violence is 5.8 per cent
larger than the population with all causes
present, compared to 3.2 per cent larger in
the female-dominant projections. In the
other cases, the effect on proportionate
growth after eighty years is nearly identical in the two sets of projections. Even
though the increment to the intrinsic
growth rate is larger in every instance for
the male-dominant projections, the consequence is effectively obscured through the
first eighty years (except for violence) by
the higher fertility and younger age structure pertaining to the male-dominant projections; in a younger population, the
older ages receive less weight in the overall
outcome. The population without violence
is larger than that without cardiovascular
disease after 158 years and beyond.

Because the elimination of a cause of
death has a slightly larger impact on the
intrinsic growth rate in the male-dominant
projection, the tendency for the population to grow older is slightly attenuated.
Again, this result is noteworthy only for
violence, whose elimination actually increases the proportion of the population
under age 15 by a tiny amount and produces a slightly higher birth rate. Other
changes in age composition induced by
mortality reductions are very much the
same as in the female-dominant case, and
changes in sex ratios and widowhood proportions are nearly identical in the two sets
of projections.

We conclude that the original results
are not sensitive to the assumption of
female dominance, with the exception of
certain calculations relating to violence.
Most notably, the intrinsic growth rate
increases by 0.74/1,000 when violence is
eliminated in the male dominant projection, compared to an increase of 0.24/1,000
when females are dominant. This substantial difference is further indication of
the need for a practicable solution to the
problem of the sexes.

DECLINING FERTILITY PROJECTIONS
A third set of projections was prepared
to demonstrate how declining mortality inDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

teracts with declining fertility in its demographic effects. These projections utilize
the U.S. Bureau of the Census E-schedule
of fertility beginning in 1974 (U.S. Bureau
of the Census, 1972) .3 In brief, this schedule assumes that cohorts of women who
had not entered the childbearing period
in 1969 would experience replacement level
fertility, an average of 2.11 births per
woman, and that women then in the childbearing years would progress smoothly
towards the period fertility rates implied
by the replacement-level schedule. Table
8 presents the results.

per cent; and for violence, 3.2 per cent and
3.3 per cent.

The reason for these increases in the
amount of growth is that declining fertility
gives greater weight to developments at
the older ages, where all of these causes of
death are most active. Calculations for
cardiovascular disease, with the oldest age
incidence of all, are most affected by declining fertility. However, changes in the
intrinsic growth rates are, for all practical
purposes, identical to those in the constant
fertility population. The formal reason for
this is obvious from the earlier expression

The most important consequence of incorporating fertility declines is to increase
the factor by which the population grows
when various causes of death are eliminated. Whereas the removal of cardiovascular disease produced an 11.8 per cent
larger population after eighty years of
constant fertility, it is 15.5 per cent larger
with declining fertility. The corresponding
figures for cancer are 3.1 per cent in the
constant fertility population and 3.7 per
cent with declining fertility; for infectious
and parasitic diseases, 1.7 per cent and 1.8

for the change in the intrinsic growth
rate which depends only on the average
value of u,* in an interval whose length
is subject to little variation.

Declining fertility produces an older
population and reinforces the age-structural effects of eliminating a cause of
death. After thirty years in the no-cardiovascular projection, there are almost as
many people over age 65 as under age 15.
When the steady state is achieved, the
number above 65 exceeds that under 15
by some 40 per cent. Simultaneous achievement of replacement level fertility and

ciated with aging would obviously have
revolutionary consequences for the nature
of the “dependency burden.” It has been
demonstrated repeatedly that the principal
cause of population aging has been declining fertility, but this is not a necessary
result and may not apply to future developments. With all causes present, for example, declining fertility increases the proportion over 65 from 0.120 to 0.151; but
with no declines in fertility, the elimination of cardiovascular disease increases
that proportion from 0.120 to 0.198.

SUMMARY

This paper has considered separately
the consequences for the future United
States population of eliminating deaths
from neoplasms, cardiovascular disease,
all infectious and parasitic diseases, and
violence. In a constant-fertility, femaledominant projection, none of these causes
has a substantial effect on the intrinsic
population growth rate. However, major
additions to population size would result
from elimination of cardiovascular disease
and cancer as a consequence of improved
survivorship among persons in the postreproductive ages. Most of the relative
growth in these cases occurs within thirty
years after disease eradication. After several centuries, well beyond the planning
horizon, the population without violent
death exceeds in size any of those without
the other causes of death.

The population “ages” in each of the
four cases. After thirty years, the proportion of the total population over age
65 has grown by 62 per cent as a result of
the elimination of cardiovascular disease
and by 12 per cent in the case of cancer.
In order to retain the previous numerical
relationship between the number of retired and of economically active males,
age at retirement would eventually have to
increase by approximately ten years and

two years, respectively, when these diseases are eliminated. The sex ratio (M/F)
for all ages combined undergoes little
change when a cause is eliminated; but it
almost invariably increases at a particular
age, and these changes can be quite large
at the higher ages.

The probability of having a living
mother or father for a person under age 20
changes by less than 2 per cent when
cancer or cardiovascular disease is eliminated. Cancer has a bigger impact on
orphanhood by death of mothers; cardiovascular disease, on orphanhood by death
of fathers. As age progresses, the elimination of a cause has a progressively larger
impact on the probability of having a living parent. Without cardiovascular disease, 10.8 per cent of survivors to age 80
would still have a living mother (vs. 0.2
per cent when all causes are present). Of
1,000 marriages which both partners contract at age 30, 62 more will survive the
risk of mortality for thirty years if cancer
is eliminated, and 120 more will survive
this period if none die from cardiovascular
disease. However, the tendency for the
prevalence of widowhood to decline in
the population as a whole is largely or
completely offset by the longer survivorship of those widows produced.

The elimination of these diseases affects future per capita income by no more
than 1 per cent except in the case of
cardiovascular disease, where income declines by some 5.3 per cent in the steady
state. The changes are undoubtedly inconsequential in comparison to the value
that people place on their own lives or
on those of close relatives and can be
safely neglected for planning purposes.

The procedures used in the basic projections have probably produced underestimates of the effects of cause-of-death
elimination on population size. Fertility
has already declined substantially from its

1969 levels, and declining fertility weights
more heavily developments at older ages.
Using the census bureau’s replacementlevel fertility schedule, the population
without cardiovascular disease is 15.5 per
cent larger after eighty years than the population with all causes present, instead of
11.8 per cent larger, as in the projections
with constant fertility. The effect of eliminating other causes also increases, but in
smaller proportion.

If reproduction is assumed to be maledominant rather than female-dominant,
the effect of elimination on size and
growth is again enhanced, because of
higher male mortality and older male
fertility. The changes are particularly im

portant for violence, whose elimination
increases the population after eighty years
by 5.8 per cent rather than by 3.2 per cent.
The scope for additions to population size
from further reductions in mortality is
clearly much larger than indicated by
comparison of female intrinsic growth
rates.
