Marital Stability as a Social Indicator*

Paul C. Glick

U.S. Bureau of the Census
Washington, D.C.

The counteracting effects of a rising marriage rate and a rising divorce rate during
the 1960’s' present several questions, answers to which are sought in this paper:
What has been the net change in the proportion of adults currently living in the married
state?? Has the change been the same for
young persons as for persons of more mature
age? Has the change occurred uniformly
among men and women and among white
and nonwhite persons? What kind of “‘indicators” can be devised to summarize the
“favorableness” of the observed changes in
terms of increasing (or decreasing) marital
stability??

The data in the accompanying tables
show the directions and magnitudes of re

meeting of the Population Association of America

of the Census.

1 The marriage rate for the twelve months ending
November 1968 was 10.3 per 1,000 population; the
corresponding rate for 1960 was 8.5. The divorce
rate per 1,000 population was 2.7 in 1967 as compared with 2.2 in 1960. See National Center for
Health Statistics, Afonthly Vital Statistics Report,
Vol. 17, Nos. 10, 11, 10 supplement, and 11 supplement; also, Marriage Statistics Analysis: United
States, 1963, and Divorce Statistics Analysis, 1963.

2 Changes in marital status by age and race for
the period 1930 to 1960 are featured in Hugh Carter
and Paul C. Glick, “Trends and Current Patterns
of Marital Status Among Nonwhite Persons,”

cent changes in marital status, including
substantial increases in the proportion married for some population groups which have
been partly offset by decreases in the proportion married for other groups and by an
upturn in the proportion divorced among
most population groups.

As the findings are presented, the reader
may wish to consider the probable reasons
for the recent changes in marital status; for
example, the proportion married among
those below old age has risen partly because
couples are surviving jointly for an increasing number of years. But, in addition, the
proportion living as bachelors and spinsters
has been falling steadily as a larger proportion of the population is becoming financially able and socially free to marry or to remarry according to personal choice while
still within the preferred age range for

*This paper is an extension of the analysis
presented in a background paper on marriage trends
which was prepared at the request of staff members
of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare who were in charge of exploring the possibility of assembling “social statistics and indicators” for
the nation. Information on “‘these yardsticks” was
issued in January, 1969, as a report from Secretary
Wilbur J. Cohen to the President entitled Toward a
Social Report. The letter of transmittal states that
the report “deals with such aspects of the quality
of American life as: health and illness; social mobility; the physical environment; income and poverty;

public order and safety; learning, science, and art;
and participation and alienation.”

marriage. While more people are now divorced, the basic data do not reveal whether
this means that more people now have ser1ous marital discord than previously or
whether more of those who have serious
marital troubles are becoming financially
able and socially free to settle those troubles
by leaving an intolerable marriage through
divorce, and perhaps later entering a tolerable remarriage.

The findings in this study consist of a
summary evaluation of recent changes in
marital status (by age, color, and sex) in
terms of net movement of social groups in
“favorable” or ‘unfavorable’ directions
according to the proportions single, with
marriages intact, with marriages disrupted
by separation or divorce, and widowed. The
changes are divided into forty components,
based on sample data from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey, and a
judgment is expressed about each component as to whether it represents a favorable
or an unfavorable change. Discussion of the
judgment factor is given in a later section.
The components are identified as the twenty

cells in the third and sixth columns of Table
1 labeled “Change” (excluding the cells for
total men and total women) and the twenty
corresponding cells in Table 2. Attention is
directed first to the steps taken in developing these forty components.

DEVELOPMENT OF COMPONENTS
OF CHANGE

Table 1 shows changes in marital] status
between “1960” and “1965” for persons 18
to 24 years old, and Table 2 shows similar
data for persons 25 to 64 years old. These
groups were selected for presentation because recent changes in the per cent married
have been generally in opposite directions
for the younger and older of these two
groups, Persons under 18 were omitted from
this study because the proportions married
are small. However, the general pattern in
this very young group was favorable in the
sense that it was toward a decline in marriage. Persons 65 and over were omitted
because of the small proportion of persons at
that age who marry, and the present study

is oriented toward those in the main ages for
marriage.

The first step in assembling the data was
to combine the published figures from Current Population Reports for five-year periods
in order to stabilize the results. As the footnotes on the tables state, the columns labeled ‘'1960” contain data averaged for the
five years 1958 to 1962, and those labeled
**19065” contain data averaged for the five
years 1963 to 1967. A secondary consideration in making these combinations is that
none of the children born soon after World
War II had reached 18 years of age by
1962, but several million had done so by
1967. A tertiary consideration is the timing of the recent upturn in divorce in the
United States; between 1962 and 1967 the
number of divorces went up 20% (413,000
to 534,000). After the basic data were combined for the two five-year periods, the distributions for 1960 were standardized for age
within each cell of Tables 1, 2, and 5, using
1965 data as the base. The full age detail
available was used in this process (18-19,

Social Biology

20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-44, 45-54, and
55-64).

Table 3 shows a number and a direction
(up or down) for each of the forty components of change in marital status. The direction stated for each component is the favorable one, and the sign of the number “1” in
front of it indicates whether the observed
change between 1960 and 1965 was or was
not in the favorable direction. To illustrate,
‘*1 up” for single white men 18 to 24 years of
age means that an upward movement in
per cent single for this group (signifying a
tendency to delay marriage) was judged to
be a favorable change, and the fact that the
“1” is positive means that the actual observed change between 1960 and 1965 was
in the favorable direction. The ‘0 down”
for white men 18 to 24 with marriage intact
means that a downward movement for this
group was judged to be favorable, but the
“0” means that no change took place in the
five-year period among these persons (who
were married but not separated). And, the
“‘_— 1 down” for divorced white men 18 to 24

means that a downward movement was
judged favorable for them, but the “— 1”
means that the actual change was in the unfavorable direction.

In the first two rows of components, for
single persons and persons with marriage
intact, the determination of favorableness
was contingent upon age. Thus, an upward
change in the per cent single was judged to
be favorable for those under 25, but a downward change was considered favorable for
those 25 to 64. Consistent with these norms,
changes in the opposite directions for persons with marriage intact were considered
favorable. As stated above, comments about
the propriety of the norms adopted will be
made in a later section of the paper. The remaining three marital status categories relate to marriages which are “not intact,”
and for each the favorable direction for
change was judged to be downward.

In the total rows and columns of Table 3

Marital Stability as a Social Indicator

161

the summary numbers shown are net counts
of favorable changes in marital status. They
were obtained by subtracting the number of
negative ‘‘1’s” from the number of positive
“1’s” and disregarding ‘“Q’s.”? For example,
as the footnote to Table 3 implies, the figure
16 in the upper left corner means that 26
favorable changes were counterbalanced by
10 unfavorable changes, with the result that
16 more changes among the 40 components
were favorable than were unfavorable. Instead of positive 16, this figure could have
been as high as positive 40 or as low as
negative 40.

Table 4 shows numbers with the same
meaning as those in Table 3, except that, as
the footnote indicates, only the “major”
changes are shown, where major is defined
as a change of four-tenths of one per cent or
more. (All changes of 0.4% or more were
statistically significant at the two sigma
level.) For example, in Table 1 the per cent

single for young white men rose by 1.1%
between 1960 and 1965; since that increase
was more than 0.4% and in a favorable
direction, it is shown as a positive “1” in
Table 4.

ANALYSIS OF COMPONENTS OF CHANGE

Fully twenty of the forty components of
change in marital status over the last decade, as defined for this study, were interpreted as major changes in a favorable direction, and only six of the forty as major
changes in an unfavorable direction. The
other fourteen components of change were
not classified as major. Within this generally
favorable picture, however, some similarities
and some very wide differences between
findings for white and nonwhite groups are
apparent.

Both color groups were alike in that they
scored 10 favorable major changes. Among
whites, 7 of these 10 changes were conse

quences of an increasing tendency for white
persons to be married; that is, to marry
rather than become bachelors or spinsters,
to remain married, or to remarry rather
than remain widowed or divorced. The
other favorable changes for whites consisted
of very sharp declines in the per cent separated among young persons (with no compensating major rise in per cent divorced)
and a decline of about one-tenth in the per
cent widowed among white women 25 to 64.
Among nonwhites, 4 of the 10 favorable major changes reflected shifts toward mature
adult age at marriage, 2 were for declines in
per cent separated among young persons
(the same as for whites), 1 for a substantial
decline in per cent divorced for nonwhite
men 18 to 24, and 3 for sharp declines in per
cent widowed.

Five of the six components denoting unfavorable major changes were found among
the nonwhites. The only white component

in this category was an increase in per cent
divorced for white women 25 to 64 years
old. Among nonwhites, 3 of the 5 changes
identified as unfavorable—but to be challenged below—were associated with increasing entrance of nonwhite young people into
marriage, The other 2 identified as unfavorable—but also to be challenged below—represented substantial increases in
the per cent divorced among nonwhite men
and women 25 to 64 years old.

The net scores on components of major
change varied from a high of 5 favorable for
white women to a low of 2 favorable for
nonwhite men (see Table 5). Moreover, the
net scores varied from 5 favorable for young

white persons to 2 favorable for young nonwhite persons, though all four groups by
color and age scored 5 favorable major
changes (see Table 6). When the eight
groups by age, color, and sex were compared, young white women ranked highest
with 3 favorable and no unfavorable major
changes, whereas young nonwhite men
ranked lowest with 2 favorable and 2 unfavorable major changes (see Table 7).
The results in Tables 3 and 4 provide a
basis for concluding that more major as well
as minor changes in marital status between
1960 and 1965 were favorable than unfavorable. They also provide a basis for
judging the respects in which improvements
and reverses have occurred, as long as the

ateness of some of the norms used in preparing Tables 3 and 4. Specifically, alternative
norms were seriously considered as follows:

(a2) For young nonwhites, count a decrease
in per cent single as favorable, and for consistency count an increase in per cent with
marriage intact as favorable. These new
norms for young nonwhites would then be

opposite those used for young whites. The rationale behind this proposal is the fact that
in 1960 the per cent with marriage intact was
much lower for young nonwhites than for
young whites and the assumption that an
increase in this percentage would largely
reflect improved circumstances among young
nonwhites which offered them a greater
measure of free choice about age at marriage.
This rationale was not considered sufficiently
plausible, however, to justify the use of opposing norms for young whites and young
nonwhites.

(b) For all groups (by age, color, and sex)
count an increase in divorce as favorable.
The rationale behind this proposal rests on
the observation that some segments of the
population have decreased their per cent separated at the same time that they have increased their per cent divorced; the inference

in Table 8 which reveals the impressive fact
that when these alternatives are used the
number of unfavorable components of major
change in marital status is reduced from six
to only two. These two “unfavorable” components, as newly defined, are a decrease in
divorce for young nonwhite men and an increase in per cent single for young nonwhite

women—neither of which seems particularly
unfavorable, in the context of substantia]
declines in per cent separated for young
nonwhite men and women. The alternative
norms place older nonwhite persons at the
top of the list in regard to net major favorable changes and leave young nonwhite
persons with the only unfavorable changes.

2. Use other age detail. If the analysis in
Table 4 had been carried out for the combined age group 18 to 64 on the basis of the
data in Table 9, the general pattern of the
results would have been very similar to the
pattern for the group 25 to 64 years old in
Table 4. This finding is a consequence in
part of the use of the same norms of favorableness for persons 18 to 64 as for those 25
to 64. However, the use of a single complete
age range (instead of placing the younger
and older groups separately in a disaggregated analysis) obscures the internal “mix”
and therefore provides less basis for pinpointing the groups which are changing
their marital status in one direction or
another.

If the basic data had been available in
finer age detail, somewhat different age
groupings of younger and older persons
might have been selected. Thus, for women,
relatively young marriage might have been
defined as something like 16 to 20 years of
age, and for men young marriage might have
been defined as something like 18 to 22.
Beginning with Current Population Survey
tabulations made in 1968, age detail by
single years from 16 to 25 will become available annually for single and ever-married
persons by sex and race.

3. Altach weights to components. Another variation in summarizing the marital
changes would be to attach weights to the
components, such as the algebraical amount
of the changes recorded in Tables 1 and 2,
with the signs modified as necessary to agree
with the norms given in Table 3. This procedure would clearly show young white

Marital Stability as a Social Indicator

165

women as having made the largest volume of
favorable change and young white men as
having made relatively little change, according to the norms in Table 3.

4, Show rates of change. An alternative to
the simple arithmetic changes in Tables 1
and 2 would be to replace them with rates
of change over the five-year period. Among
the considerations for rejecting this alternative was the smallness of several of the marital status categories; not only the amounts
of change but also the bases of the rates of

change would be subject to considerable
variation because of sampling error. At the
same time, this alternative might dismiss as
minor some substantial changes in the larger
marital categories (amounting to 1% or
more).

5. Change the number of marital status
categories. The number of components of
change could be reduced by combining per
cent separated and per cent divorced into a
single category for ‘‘per cent with marriage
disrupted.” Table 10 shows that the ‘‘net
favorable” count would not be very different whether marriage disrupted is counted
as one or two components. However, showing only the combined category would obscure the considerable differences in the inDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

SUMMARY

This study of recent major changes in
marital status justifies the conclusion that a
clear majority of the changes were favorable, where “favorable” reflects an increase
in the proportion single among young adults
and an increase in proportion married
among adults of more mature age. According to the criteria used, nonwhites recorded
10 favorable major changes out of a possible
20, 5 unfavorable major changes, and 5 which
were not classified as major. Whites likewise
recorded 10 favorable major changes, but
only 1 unfavorable major change and 9
changes not classified as major, Thus, de

spite the evidence of gains in marital stability among nonwhites, the evidence of such
gains among whites was even stronger. By
various ways of measuring and evaluating
changes in marital status between 1960 and
1965, young white women scored relatively
high, and young nonwhite men scored relatively low, on net favorable change.
Advantages and disadvantages of several
alternative measures of change in marital
status were presented, together with the
effects that some of the alternatives would
have had on the evaluation of changes if
they had been adopted. In general, if the alternative procedures had been adopted,
similar overall conclusions, but somewhat
unlike detailed conclusions, would have been
drawn about changes in marital status for
subgroups by age, color, and sex.
