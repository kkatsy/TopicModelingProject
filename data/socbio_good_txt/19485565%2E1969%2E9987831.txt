and Smoking Habit

Whenever death rates can be correlated
with several personal characteristics considered in isolation, the question arises
whether the apparent ‘‘causative” nature of
any one characteristic results from the fact
that another is uncontrolled. We are now in
the fortunate position of knowing that mortality rates among U.S. males in middle life,
between ages 25 and 64, show a distinct inverse relation with educational attainment
(Kitagawa and Hauser, 1968) and a positive
relation with amount of cigarette smoking
(U.S. Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare, 1964).! Moreover, these relations persist for almost every cause of death
examined in the studies. This paper addresses the question of whether cigarette smoking differences among the education groups
(taken here as a measure of social class) can
account for their mortality gradient, or,
conversely, whether class differences between smokers and nonsmokers can explain
the excessive mortality of smokers. A new

1 There have been seven large prospective studies
of smokers’ mortality, five of which examined United
States populations. None of the populations sampled
was considered representative of the United States
population as a whole. A detailed comparison of the
studies {together with the appropriate references)
may be found in United States Department of
Health, Education and Welfare Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the
Public Health Service, 1964 (pp. 77-120), hereafter
referred to as the “Surgeon General’s Report.”

method of inquiry into this type of question
is suggested, and the results checked against
an older method.

CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SOCIAL CLASS

The reason for believing results of the two
types of studies to be related is the discovery in several surveys of a higher prevalence of cigarette smoking in lower social
classes, whether grouped by occupation or
education. The only representative sample
of the United States male population in this
regard was taken in 1955 and examined
smoking rates in the different occupational
groups (Haenszel, Shimkin and Miller,
1956) in which the percentage of current
smokers (males, not age-adjusted) varied
from a low of 42.7% in “Professional Technical, and Kindred” to a high of 54.7%
among “Craftsmen, Foremen, and Kindred.”’ The figure for “Laborers, excluding
Farm and Mine’”’ was 54.0%. Moreover, in
the lower occupational groupings there was
a slight tendency for those who smoked to
consume larger daily amounts.

We have no representative sample of consumption by groups at different educational
levels, but there are indications that a similar gradient exists. A study of male Bell
Telephone employees in 1968 found at that
age 55 the percentage of men with no college

background who were smokers was twice as
high as the percentage of college men
(Hinkle et al., 1968). A special census of
Washington County, Maryland, in 1963
showed that 62.3% of white males aged 2544 who had not attended high school were
current cigarette smokers, compared to
49.5% of those who attended college A
larger study by Hammond examined men in
25 states and found a similar differential
(Hammond and Garfinkel, 1961). The largest disparity was found at ages 40-49, where
43.9% of college graduates were current
cigarette smokers compared to 62.1% of
those with “some high school.” In addition,
a smoker who graduated from college
showed a distinct preference for brands
lower in nicotine content, but tended to
smoke more heavily.

Hammond (1964) also derived death rates
cross-classified by educational attainment
and smoking status, which are presented in
Table 1. It is clear that both heavy smoking
and low educational attainment are independently associated with high mortality
rates, with mortality approximately doubling over the range of smoking behavior examined and increasing by 18 to 40% over
the range of social class. In this paper we
shall develop a method of analyzing mortality differentials that points to the same conclusion, but that can be employed when direct cross-classification of death rates is not
possible. The method that will be proposed
has the added advantage of identifying
causes of death whose association with one
of the “risk factors” is most likely to be
spurious.

A TEST OF THE INFLUENCE OF SMOKING
ON SOCIAL CLASS MORTALITY

The test of independence of mortality
ratios by smoking status and social class
that is proposed here relies on the existence

of mortality ratios from many different
causes of death in both types of studies. If
the higher death rates of the lower educational groups result solely from their higher
proportion of cigarette smokers, then it is
intuitively clear that their disadvantage will
be worse for a particular disease the greater
the smoking risk for that disease. If such a
monotonic relation between social risk and
smoking risk emerges, then the dependence

More formally, if we let

K,; = relative mortality risk of Educational
Group j, Causez (college-educated =
1.00);
Xj; = proportion of smokers in Educational

then the ratio of the death rate from Causez
in Educational Group 1 to that which it
would be in the absence of smoking is
Xi(P;) + (1 — Xi) X 1. For Educational
Group 0, it is Xo(P;) + (1 — Xo) X 1.
Thus, the ratio of death rates of Group 1 to
Group 0, assuming that all of the difference
results from X; # Xo, is

Ka=j + X.(P; — 1) °

It is clear from this formula that if X1 >
Xo, then Kj will rise as P; rises (the formal
statement of the intuitive notion stated directly above). However, the rise will not be
proportional to AP; because of the presence
of a constant term. The constant term is
eliminated only if X; = 1 and X» = 0, in
which case Ky, = P; because all of Group 1
and none of Group 0 are smokers. These
relations between K;, and P;, are illustrated
in Figure 1. If X; = 1 and Xo = 0, the relation between K,, and P; will be the 45° line
through the origin (Curve 0). But in the only
cases we are likely to encounter in reality,
the relation will be curvilinear (Curve A illustrates). We should note finally that if

social differences had caused the excessive
mortality of smokers to appear, the curve
would be written along the y-axis and all
points would lie above the 45° line (Curve B).

In conclusion, if one set of risks appears
only because the groups employed to measure the risk have differential exposure to a
second, uncontrolled, mortality factor, the
measured disease-specific mortality risks of
the two factors should bear a curvilinear
relation to one another of the type illustrated by curves A and B of Figure 1. We
shall now see whether educational and smoking class mortality differentials bear such a
relation to one another.

The education differentials for United
States males aged 25-64 in 1960 are adopted
from Kitagawa and Hauser (1968), and the
smoking risk essentially from the large Hammond study of men in 25 states (Hammond,
1966). The latter study achieved some geo

graphic diversity and had the added advantage for our purposes of running from
1959 to 1963. Unfortunately, the Dorn study
(Kahn, 1966) of United States veterans had
to be employed at certain ages below 45
since the Hammond data lacked this range.
The possible confusions introduced are
minimized by the fact that the younger ages
contribute relatively little to the size of the
age-standardized mortality rate. The relevant data may be found in Table 2.

Death rates for all groups are first agestandardized to the 1960 United States male
population by ten-year age groups, and then
ratios computed for the appropriate groups.
The mortality ratios for males 25-64 are
plotted in Figure 2. Along the y-axis is the
ratio of death rates for those who completed
less than eight years of school to those of the

college educated for the various causes.
Along the x-axis is the ratio of smokers’
to nonsmokers’ death rates.

The points in Figure 2 appear at first to
be randomly distributed. Evidently no one
monotonically-rising curve could succeed in
accounting for much of the variation. But
upon closer examination it can be seen that
almost all points lie near one of the two lines
radiating from the origin (1.00). Some curvature of these lines is indicated, but an
insufficiency of observations prevents a confident appraisal of their shape. It appears
that the diseases which fall near line A are
those for which evidence on the physiological risk from smoking is most conclusive

pharynx, larynx, and esophagus where the
mortality ratios for smokers are quite high).
Not only do smokers suffer highly elevated
risks from these diseases, but clinical studies
have thus far suggested numerous reasons
why such risks should appear.*® Of all the
diseases included in Figure 2 only lung cancer, arteriosclerotic heart disease, and certain “‘other cancers” can confidently be considered “causally” related to smoking, according to the Surgeon General’s Report
(1964) and U.S. Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare (1968). The points
along Curve B are similarly those which one
might ordinarily associate most closely with
social class, especially as reflected in health
conditions: tuberculosis, influenza and pneumonia, accidents, diabetes, rheumatic heart
disease, and cancers of the digestive tract
(probably related to diet).

POSSIBLE BIAS IN SMOKERS’ RISKS: THE
CASE OF THE BRITISH DOCTORS

One of the inferences suggested by Figure
2 and the analysis which preceded it is that
mortality ratios from cigarette smoking for
causes not included in line A may be greater
than unity because of a difference in social
condition between smokers and nonsmokers.
The fact that the smoking risk from these
“unrelated” causes generally increases with
the “social” risk is wholly consistent with
the hypothesis that social factors have created the appearance of a mortality risk from
smoking for these causes. This reasoning implies, of course, that if social class could be
controlled the mortality ratio from these
causes would be approximately unity. While
the appropriate data is not available for the
United States a study of the smoking risk
among British physicians conducted by Doll
and Hill (1966) has implicitly standardized

3 Such would also be the case for bronchitis and
emphysema, for which education data are currently
lacking. For a review of all clinical and pathological
evidence, see the Surgeon General’s Report and its
sequel, The Health Consequences of Smoking (U.S.
woe of Health, Education, and Welfare,
1967).

Mortality, Social Class, and Smoking

285

for education and occupation, if not for income, It is worth noting that of the seven
prospective studies summarized in the
Surgeon General’s Report (1964), the DollHill study uncovered the lowest overall mortality ratio of smokers to nonsmokers, 1.44
compared to a median of 1.68. This difference would tend to support the notion that
social class has elsewhere contributed to the
differential. Among the “unrelated” causes
included along line B in Figure 2, the death
rate ratio from violence was 1.0; from influenza and pneumonia, 0.7; and the ratio
from stomach cancer was reduced to 1.1. On
the other hand, the ratio from rheumatic
heart disease was still 1.3; from Cancer of
the rectum and intestines, 1.4,

No data were published which allowed the
comparison of mortality ratios from diabetes
or tuberculosis, also included in line B.
However, data from the study which appeared after the Surgeon General’s Report
indicate that cigarette smokers in the DollHill study (1966) did continue to suffer a
higher fatality from pulmonary tuberculosis.
This implies that tuberculosis may not be a
cause unrelated to cigarette smoking, thus
removing it from line B. On the other hand,
since infection occurs early in life it could
also mean that the early social condition of
smoking doctors differed from the early
social condition of nonsmoking doctors. In
any case, the N is very small (only 2 deaths
to non-smokers at all ages combined) and
would not appreciably alter the conclusions.

Since the Doll-Hill study was small, random variation could be expected to play a
relatively large role in the mortality ratios.
The role of random factors is reduced by
calculating the excess of actual over expected deaths for all of these ‘“‘unrelated”’
causes combined. In the Doll-Hill study the
mortality ratio of smokers from all these
five causes combined was 1.03. Combining
the other six studies cited in the Surgeon
General’s Report (1964, p. 109-110), the
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

286 Preston

equivalent ratio was 1.20. Thus the standardization of social class achieved by Doll
and Hill (1966) succeeded in virtually
eliminating the net contribution of these
“unrelated” causes to smokers’ excessive
mortality.

POSSIBLE BIAS IN EDUCATIONAL RISKS:
THE CASE OF ELDERLY MALES

The second inference suggested by Figure
2 is that a differential prevalence of cigarette smoking among the social classes may
account for the inequality of their mortality
risks from arteriosclerotic heart disease,
lung cancer, and “‘other cancers.’”4 In order
for this to be the case, the differences in proportion of smokers among the several classes
would have to be quite large. In our example, if the percentage of smokers among
the <8 was 67 and that among the collegeeducated was 33, then in applying the mortality ratios of smokers from each of the
three causes found in Table 2, we find that
the mortality ratio of the <8 to college
would be 1.71 from lung cancer (vs. 1.94
actual), 1.27 from arteriosclerotic heart
disease (vs. 1.24 actual), and 1.20 from
“other cancers” (vs. 1.05 actual).5

The requisite distribution of smokers is
consistent with that estimated by Hinkle
(1968) but more extreme than indicated by
Hammond (1961). However, the Hammond
study indicates that an observed difference
in proportions of smokers might understate
the effect on their relative mortality, since
a college-educated smoker tends to smoke
brands less harmful to health. Still, the most
likely percentages of smokers in the two
groups (on the basis of Hammond [1961] and

4 The disease “cirrhosis of the liver,” also appears
to be a smoking-related cause of death. However, its
incidence is probably related neither to smoking nor
to social class but to alcohol consumption. What
Figure 2 may show, then, is that alcohol consumption is more closely related to smoking than to social
class.

’ The calculation for lung cancer, for example, is

Social Biology

the representative sample of smoking by occupation) are closer to 55 and 40, which
would produce risks of 1.28, 1.10, and 1.08
from lung cancer, arteriosclerotic heart
disease, and other cancers among the <8
group. If we accept these latter figures, then
social class must play a role in male mortality from lung cancer and heart disease that is
independent of cigarette smoking.

The Hammond survey (1961) found no
consistent educational differences in proportions smoking among males above age 60 or
among any of the female age groups. According to our reasoning, class differentials
from lung cancer, arteriosclerotic heart
disease, and “other cancers” should not appear for these groups. In fact, Kitagawa and
Hauser (1968) found that among males
65+, the social-class gradient for the three
diseases in question was largely eliminated.
The ratio for the <8 group to the college
group for heart disease is 1.01; from “other
cancers,” 0.82; and from lung cancer, 1.18.
The gradient from many “social” causes is
similarly reduced, but stomach cancer remains high at 1.87, influenza and pneumonia
at 1.32, and accidents at 1.85.

On the other hand, there also appears to
be no tendency for poorer-educated females
to smoke more heavily.® Yet the social class
gradient among females 25-64 is 1.36 from
lung cancer, 2.06 from arteriosclerotic heart
disease, and 1.11 from “other cancers” (not
including uterus and breast cancer). Cigarettes can in no way be suspected of having
caused these differentials, The relevant
question for our group of 25-64-year-old

6 That is not to say that other demographic, and
perhaps class, differences between female smokers
and nonsmokers may not exist. Such differences are
indicated by mortality rates from breast cancer
(0.78 for smokers) and cancer of the uterus and
ovary (1.16 for smokers). Both mortality gradients
have applied to lower social classes in both the
Kitagawa-Hauser study (1968) and in a study of
class mortality in England and Wales (Logan, 1954).
Both risks are felt to be related to a woman’s parity,
negatively for breast cancer and positively for
uterine and ovarian cancer. It appears that female
smokers have borne more children than female nonsmokers, a crude measure of social class.

Vol. 16, No. 4

males is whether the social class gradient of
their female counterparts provides a more
appropriate model than the lack of gradient
among the older males.

Any answer to this question 1s necessarily
speculative, but there are several indications
of an increasing dissimilarity between male
and female mortality experience in Western
countries. First, as Kitagawa and Hauser
(1968) show, female and male behavior
above age 65 is quite different, with females
continuing to display inverse risks with
social class and males no gradient whatsoever (the female risk from “all causes combined” is 1.56, while the male risk is 1.01).
Second, studies of mortality by social class
in England and Wales have found that mortality gradients from the most important
cause of death, coronary heart disease, run
in opposite directions for males and females
aged 20-64 in 1950 (Logan, 1954). Finally,
the trend of male and female death rates
from heart disease and cancer since 1930 are
typically divergent in Western countries.
Spiegelman (1954) finds that male death
rates at ages 45-64 from circulatory diseases
and cancer have increased in 12 and 11 out
of 18 Western countries from 1930 to 1950,
while female death rates from either of the
same causes have increased in only 3 out of
18. Evidently, important factors in the
etiology of cancer and heart disease are sexspecific. As a result, the relation between
male and female mortality rates from these
causes is highly variable and provides an unstable standard of measurement. The lack of
gradient among older males may provide the
more relevant expectation for males aged
25-64,

DISCUSSION

We can estimate the maximum potential
bias in mortality differentials from ‘all
causes combined” that has resulted from a

from causes along line A reduces the “all
cause” ratio from 1.48 to 1.34 for the <8
group to the college group. Similarly, eliminating differences between smokers’ and
nonsmokers’ death rates from causes along
line B reduces the overall risk from smoking
from 1.74 to 1.64. In both cases, of course,
the figures refer to U.S. males aged 25-64.?
The reduction is larger among the social
classes because the equalization of death
rates is applied to quantitatively more important causes of death. In neither case,
obviously, have we succeeded in explaining
away a majority of the differential mortality
from ‘fall causes combined.” This result,
then, is consistent with Hammond’s data in
Table 2 which showed that risks from smoking and in lower social classes persist independently of one another.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

This analysis has suggested that social
class differences between smokers and nonsmokers can account for the appearance of a
mortality risk from smoking in epidemiological studies for causes where no direct
physiological link to cigarette smoking is
suggested. The most important evidence in

7 Differentials from arteriosclerotic and degenerative heart disease, Jung cancer, and “other cancers”
were eliminated from the educational classes; differentials from influenza and pneumonia, accidents,
stomach, intestine and rectum cancers, diabetes, and
“other causes” from the cigarette ratios. Differentials from vascular lesions, hypertensive heart
disease, and “other cardiovascular-renal diseases”
were left in both, since both smoking and class may
contribute to the risk of dying from these causes.
In the cigarette calculation, death rates of nonsmokers were attributed to smokers for all of the
causes in question, and a ratio of the resulting conglomerate to nonsmokers’ death rate computed.
The appropriate data were not available to perform
this calculation for the education classes, so the following approximation was used: The eliminated
causes of death represented 51.4% of tota] deaths in
the group and had acombined mortality ratio of 1.27.
Thus the calculation was

0.514 (1.27) + 0.486 (X) = 1.48 X X = 1.70,
0.514 (1.00) + 0.486 (1.70) = 1.34.
That this is an approximation is evident from the
fact that if the relevant causes had a ratio of 1.00

instead of 1.27, the weight given to these causes
would be less than 0.514.

this regard is the tendency for smokers’
risks from these “‘unrelated” causes to rise
as the risk differential among the social
classes rises. Further support is given by the
Doll-Hill study (1966) of British physicians,
where social class is largely controlled, and
the risk from these unrelated causes essentially eliminated among smokers.

This conclusion is somewhat different
from the usual explanation of smokers’ risks
from these unrelated causes—either that
smoking increases the “pace of life,” thus
moving smokers further along a generally
rising age curve of mortality from every
cause, or that cigarette smokers have different “constitutions” and “personalities”
than nonsmokers. In fact, smokers’ excessive
mortality from so many causes has led some
researchers to conclude that the groups
studied are so disparate in personal characteristics that no statement can be made
about the mortality effect of smoking (see
Yerushalmy, 1962). The analysis presented
in this paper suggests that differences in
social, rather than personality, characteristics may be more relevant for smokers’ excessive mortality from “‘unrelated”’ causes.
Social class is undoubtedly related to such
health parameters as access to medical care,
exposure to infectious disease, and nutritional sufficiency. We need only recognize
the different distribution of social classes
among smokers and nonsmokers to account
for smokers’ mortality from “unrelated”
causes.

In particular, it is not necessary to presume that smokers are being selected on a
personality variable such as “‘recklessness,”’
which might tend to cast the association

with all diseases into doubt. Instead, we can
merely assume that smokers experience the
average mortality of the social class from
which they come. This mechanism would
seem to provide a more plausible explanation of their excessive mortality from such
causes as ‘‘diabetes” and “‘stomach cancer,”
for which the relevance of personality variables is obscure. At the same time, it affirms
the fact that class differences cannot account for smokers’ excessive mortality from
arteriosclerotic heart diseases, lung cancer,
or certain “‘other cancers,’’ diseases that are
considered to be “causally” related to
smoking.

Conversely, studies of mortality differentials by social class are probably affected
by the different incidence of smoking among
the classes. It is conceivable that all of the
social class differences from lung cancer,
“‘other cancers,’”’ and heart disease among
males 25-64 have resulted from the more
frequent resort to smoking among lower
social classes. Such a conclusion would require that differences in the proportion of
smokers among the classes be somewhat
larger than recorded in the Hammond
sample (1964) and also that in the absence
of smoking differences the mortality gradients of males 25-64 would resemble those
of males 65-++ more than those of females
25-64. The restrictiveness of these assumptions implies that our current ‘“‘best guess”
would attribute to social class an effect on
mortality from these causes independent of
smoking differences. A more definite answer
must await the appearance of a representative national sample of smoking according
to educational class.
