Sex Predetermination

at Birth

Roger J. Jones

The Biological Laboratories
Harvard University
Cambridge, Massachusetts

If it suddenly became possible for parents
to choose their child’s sex at the time of
conception, what would be the effect on
society? Would this power even be used?
Neither of these questions can be given a
definite answer, especially in the long run.
However, in the short run at least, it seems
obvious that the answer to the second
question would be yes. Imagine a suburban father subjected to the disgrace
of a family of six, all girls .. . or a father
in another culture dreading the expense of
buying brides for his four sons and having
no daughters to bring repayment. Within
many cultures and subcultures, there are
definitely different degrees of prestige attached to male and female children.

The possible effects on different societies
of parents with power of choice are, of
course, unknown. They would depend upon
exactly what use is made of this power of
choice and how extensively it is used. However, even a population which used this
power to produce balanced families—even
balanced according to an ideal which may
vary from family to family—might greatly
reduce its total fertility because each
family would achieve its ideal composition
and size. This paper is an attempt to see
what the possible effects of such power of

and the Sex Ratio

 

choice would be if used according to some
simple assumptions, which will be defined
later.

Before approaching that problem directly,
it is desirable to examine briefly the methods which exist or are being developed to
allow parents to predetermine the sex of a
child. There are three basic approaches. The
first is an attempt to separate X from Y
sperm by physical means. Since X sperm
are heavier than Y sperm, they should
separate under centrifugation. There has
been some limited success with this method
of separation. However, the high centrifugal
fields necessary in standard techniques can
damage sperm, perhaps differentially with
sex (Lindahl, 1958). More advanced techniques may be developed that will allow
separation without damage.

Male and female sperm have also been
physically separated by electrophoresis
(Gordon, 1958). At certain pH values and
under the right conditions, a collection of
sperm exposed to an electric field is supposedly separated into two groups, with
mostly female sperm at the anode and
mostly male sperm at the cathode. In one
case, 71.3% correct prediction was reported
for females and 63.7% correct prediction
for males in a separation of rabbit semen.

The problem with this method is that the
only way to test for correct separation is
by using the sperm to fertilize a female and
then checking on the offspring, a method
which is not practical for humans. Electrophoresis of human sperm has been attempted, but there has been no test for X—
Y separation. It has been suggested that
application of the differential staining of
sperm (Barlow and Vosa, 1970) could allow
this kind of separation to be developed
(Markle and Nam, 1971). However, all of
these methods require artificial insemination with sperm previously separated outside the body.

The second type of separation involves
discrimination against selected sperm inside
the female after natural intercourse. Use
of an alkaline douche to discriminate against
X sperm has been proposed, but results
have been inconclusive. The fact that Y
sperm swim faster than X sperm might also
be used for discrimination purposes, but
apparently no work has been done to try to
apply this fact for these purposes.

The last determination method is that of
selective abortion of offspring of the undesired sex. This would require some improvement of the present ability to sex an
unborn child without harming the child
if the abortions were to be performed early
enough in pregnancy to avoid endangering
the mother (Crawford, personal communication). This method would certainly meet
very strong social resistance, and for that
reason if for no other, it is likely that it
would not be used on a large scale.

For more about these methods and for
history of the subject, see Markle and Nam
(1971) or Gordon (1958).

THE MODEL

To determine in a quantitative, if rough,
way what the effects on the sex ratio at
birth could be if the ability to predetermine
sex were available and were used, a model

Social Biology

was developed. In this model, a “female”
is represented by three variables: age,
number of male children, and number of
female children (or A, M, and F). In a
given year of her life, four things can happen: (1) birth of a male child, (2) birth of
a female child, (3) exit from the model due
to either death or the voluntary decision to
have no more children, or (4) the birth of
no child, which amounts to direct advancement into the next age category. Probabilities for each of these events (P1, P2, P3,
and P4, respectively) are determined from
the three variables describing the female at
the beginning of the year. By comparing
these probabilities with a random number
between zero and one, it is possible to decide which of the four events shall actually
“occur” at each year in the reproductive
span of a female. The births that do occur
can be tabulated for as many females as is
desired to determine what the actual sex
ratio at birth would be for a real population
with similar characteristics.

As it now stands, this model would
require considerable data in order to determine the four probabilities. There are three
independent probabilities per state that the
females can occupy, and the number of such
states is the product of the duration of
fertility and (7-++1) (~-++ 2)/2, where n
is the maximum number of children that
can be in a family. In order to limit the
possible data while still approximating
reality in some sense, the following data
were used: (1) birth probabilities for U.S.
women by age (five year groupings, 15 to
44 years) and by number of previous live
births, or parity, taken from 1965 data
(U.S. Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare, 1969), as shown in Table 1;
and (2) mortality rates by age for white
U.S. women, again for 1965 (U.S. Bureau
of the Census, 1967), Table 2. Since these
data are from a single year but are being
applied to a cohort of women, the results

obtained should not be confused with
reality. However, they do provide a realistic
base for the the model in that they do apply
to a real human population and could be
cohort data for a population not radically
different from that in the United States in
1965.

To provide a starting point with which to
compare more complicated versions of the
model, a simple version was made in which
the birth probabilities were distributed
between male and female children by simply
taking the appropriate number from Table
1 and giving 51.15% of it to Pl, the
probability of a male birth, and the re
 

than parity which do have significant
effects, like race and socioeconomic factors
(Teitelbaum, 1970) can be sidestepped by
assuming that the model operates on a
homogeneous population. It has even been
suggested that the parity effect may be
attributed to socioeconomic factors (Teitelbaum and Mantel, 1971). If a more detailed model were to be constructed, it
might prove worthwhile to incorporate dependence on these factors; but for the
present purposes, the constant will suffice.

For this first model, the probability of
exit from the model, P3, was taken directly
from Table 2, the mortality rates, and P4,
the probability of simply aging, is then 1 —
(P1 + P2 + P3). No allowance was made
for the possibility of a birth and maternal

death occuring in the same year. If the
probabilities of birth and maternal death
are assumed independent, as they are in this
model, there is a very small joint probability, which has been ignored. Since the
mortality rates used include deaths associated with childbirth, the total deaths in
a large sample should be nearly correct.
But, again, this is sufficient reason for
limiting interpretation of the results to
qualitative rather than quantitative statements.

Using a PDP-10 computer, this model
was run through ten trials, each of which
consisted of 10,000 females entering the
model at age 15. The results of the ten
trials were averaged, and this number appears in the first row of Table 3. It should

be noted that the standard deviations given
are an indication of the expected deviation
from the mean of a sample of 10,000 females, although the numbers in Table 3 are
given per 1,000 females. For example, if
10,000 females are run through the model,
the number of male children will have approximately a 0.683 chance of lying within
one standard deviation of the number given
as the mean in Table 3, or 14,610 - 170.
However, if 1,000 females are run through

Social Biology

the model, it turns out that the number
of male children has the same probability
of lying in the range 1461 + 30, not +17.

The average sex ratio is 1.047, which
corresponds to a sex proportion of 51.15%
males, as expected. The standard deviations
of this value and of all the ratios in Table
3 are small enough to enable one to make
meaningful comparisons between these
values as the more inventive versions of the
model are discussed.

tion of the composition of families in model
1, This provides a more graphic description
of the results of the model and will serve
as a further point of reference against
which the later models can be meaningfully
compared. Notice the fairly smooth, regular
form, slightly twisted toward an excess of
males.

The next three models differ from the
first in that sex predetermination is applied
toward maintaining equal numbers of male
and female children in each family (deaths
of children are not accounted for, however,
and could conceivably modify the results
if taken into account). When males equal
females, Pl and P2 are determined as in
the first model. When they are unequal, the
minority sex is chosen at the appropriate
fertility rate. Model 2 assumes that this
choice is 100% effective. Model 3 assumes
either that only half the parents employ
predetermination or that the method is

effective only 75% of the time. Model 4
uses different values of method effectiveness
for males than for females. Here 71.3%
of female-directed efforts are successful, but
only 63.7% of the male-directed efforts
achieve the desired results. Although these
numbers are those previously mentioned for
experiments with rabbit semen, they were
chosen not because they represented anything in particular, but rather because they
are sufficiently different from each other
and from 100 that the effects of the difference should be visible in the results. The
results are given in Table 3.

The only significant difference from the
first model is the shifting of a few children
from male to female, as expected. But in
model 4, and even in models 2 and 3 if one
remembers that male mortality is slightly
higher than female mortality at all ages
(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1967), there
could result an imbalance in the sex ratio
in later years which could have noticeable
social effects when those children become
of marriageable age. Table 5 gives family
composition for models 2, 3, and 4. Family
composition given by model 2 reflects the
rigid assumptions used in construction of
that model. Compositions given by models
3 and 4 show the relaxation of that rigidity.
Notice that even in model 4, where the sex
ratio is less than one, males predominate
in the small families, and female predominance becomes evident only as the family
size grows. Although a result like this is
easily rationalized from the parameters
composing the model, it can be difficult to
foresee such a result directly from those
parameters.

Models 5, 6, and 7 are exactly like
models 2, 3, and 4, respectively, when the
number of female children in a family is
not equal to the number of male children.
When those two numbers are equal, the
choice of sex for the next child is male, but
the effectiveness of that choice still varies

as in the preceding set of models. The results can be found in Table 3. The added
bias toward male children in these models
results in a much higher sex ratio; but in
general the results parallel those given for
models 2, 3, and 4. Here the gradual lifting
of the requirement that there can never be
fewer males than females in a given family
as one progresses from model 5 to model 7
has an even stronger effect on the sex ratio
than the parallel changes in the previous
set of models.

As can be seen by examining the compoDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:33 08 December 2015

sitions of families in models 5, 6, and 7
as given in Table 5, as the rigidity of the
model is relaxed and more families without
an internal balance in sex ratio are allowed,
the distribution of families by composition
approaches to some degree the distribution
of the first model (Table 4). Also, notice
that for model 7, with its unequal efficiencies of predetermination for the two
sexes, small families tend to be predominantly male. However, as the families
become larger, the lower effectiveness of
male-choice compared to that for femalechoice allows the distribution to become
more balanced between males and females,
although not to the extent of overpowering
the bias toward males entirely, at least
within the range of the results shown in
Table 5.

The important point in the preceding
discussion is that the sex ratio can be
modified, severely modified for rigid enough
assumptions, by the application of sex predetermination. The extent and direction of
this modification depends upon exactly
how the ability to predetermine sex is
applied by the population.

Models 2 through 7 all have approximately the same total number of children
as model I; only the distribution of those
children between male and female has been
varied from model to model.t Models 8

1 Summary of basic assumptions of the models:
Mode] 1 assumes birth and death probabilities as
in Tables 1 and 2, with a constant 0.5115 probability that any given child will be male. Model 2
is similar to model 1 except that when M =F, the
minority sex is chosen with probability 1. Model 3
is like model 2 except that a given child of a
chosen sex has 0.75 probability of actually being
that sex. Model 4 is like model 2 except that a
given child chosen to be male has 0.637 probability
of actually being a male; and if chosen to be
female, a given child has 0.713 probability of
being female. Models 5, 6, and 7 are like models
2, 3, and 4, respectively, except that when M — F
the next child is chosen to be male. Model 8 is like
mode] 1 except that the probability that any
given child will be male is the same as in Table 6.
Models 9, 10, and 11 are like model 8 except that
in the first year in any parity class the death

through 11! take a somewhat different approach in that predetermination is used to
mold families toward an ideal composition.
Here it is assumed that predetermination is
100% effective, and the four probabilities
are used to choose which family composition
is ideal for that particular family under
consideration, to time the arrivals of
children and to determine the time of maternal death if it occurs before voluntary
exit from the model. The computations are
almost identical to those of the previous
models, but the interpretation of the computations is slightly different, and that
difference is essential.

According to the work of Sheps (1963),
if parents desire their family to contain at
least B boys and at least G girls, the probability of achieving this with B ++ G children is at the most about 0.5 when B is
equal to G, and it can be much smaller for
an unbalanced family. This seems to indicate that family sizes may actually be
somewhat larger than desired. Thus, in
models 8 through 11, where it is assumed
each family can achieve its own desired
composition, allowance is made after the
birth of each child for voluntary cessation
of childbirth.

The “ideal composition” used here is a
much modified form of the results of a survey of 283 college students concerning
their ideas of ideal family composition and
size (Markle and Nam, 1971). Those
results were originally reported by giving
the total number of students who wanted
their mth child to be of a particular sex (or
who did not express a preference) for x
ranging from 1 to 6. For use here, P1 is
taken as the appropriate number from
Table 1 multiplied by the number of
students desiring a male child plus one-half
of those expressing no preference, and then

probability from Table 2 has added to it a probability of voluntary cessation of childbirth from
able 6,

divided by the total number of students
desiring to have an mth child. This can be
simplified to the number from Table 1
multiplied by a probability that the next
child will be male (these probabilities are
listed in the second column of Table 6).
P2 is similarly determined.

P3 is defined as the appropriate mortality
rate in all years except the first year in the
model and the first year following each
birth. In those years, a probability of voluntary cessation of childbirth is added to
the mortality rate. For model 8, this voluntary exit probability was taken as always
zero, and the values used in models 9, 10,
and 11 are given in Table 6. The values
given for model 10 were derived from the
previously mentioned survey as one minus
the quotient of the number desiring to have
an nth child divided by the number desiring
to have an (mn —1)th child. The values
used in model 9 are one-half of those in
model 10, and the values in model 11 are
arranged to give very strong pressure toward having small families. Notice that
these voluntary exit probabilities are in
effect being added on top of such voluntary
cessation of childbirth as is implicit in the
birth probabilities being used.

The results of models 8 through 11 are
given at the bottom nf Table 3. The results

 

209

of model 8 can be taken as a reference point
since the arbitrary nature of the assumptions made in defining an ideal family contain a certain amount of built-in bias. The
sex ratio can be seen to increase markedly
as the total number of children decreases.
Notice, too, that the number of female
children falls below the number needed to
maintain the female population size, so that
in these particular cases the ability to
achieve ideal family composition, resulting
in smaller family size, causes the female
population to be unable to maintain its
numbers. The intensity of the force toward
small families can be indicated by showing
the number of women exiting from the
model before age 45. The numbers listed
under model 8 in Table 7 show the numbers

leaving from mortality only, much as in
models 1 through 7. Under models 9, 10,
and 11 are listed the numbers leaving under
the combined influence of mortality and
voluntary exit.

The compositions of families are indicated in Table 8 for the last set of models.
In all four models there is evidence of the
nonbalanced nature of the assumed sex
preferences in families having few children;
but as the family size increases, the distribution becomes fairly smooth and regular,
and quite symmetrical between males and
females. However, the initial tendency, that
the first child shall be male, is never over

come completely. As the pressure toward
smaller families increases, more and more
families remain in the highly biased size
range, and the sex ratio increases markedly.
This is much the same as saying that it is
not practical for a population of one-child
families to insist that the first child be
male, except that here the case is not quite
so extreme.

DISCUSSION

The specific results in these eleven
models should be used only with the greatest of care and attention to the particular

Social Biology

assumptions which generated them. On the
other hand, the assumptions are not so far
removed from possibility that the general
results are not of value. Sex predetermination, if applied freely by a population for
private aims such as bringing balance to the
intra-family sex ratio or achieving one’s
ideal family composition, can greatly affect
the sex ratio at birth in that population.
This effect is determined by both the character of the method of determination and
the application of that method.

Among the results of the survey used as
a starting point for the last four models is
the fact that roughly one-quarter of the
students surveyed said that their attitudes
toward sex predetermination was ‘favorable,” and this fraction was even larger
among the older participants, those of a
more likely age for marriage (Markle and
Nam, 1971). This fact indicates that if
acceptable and reliable predetermination
methods were available they would be used,
at least by some people. The social effects
of an imbalance in sex ratio may be important enough that further work should be
done to predict what may actually occur
before such time as sex predetermination
methods become available to the public.
