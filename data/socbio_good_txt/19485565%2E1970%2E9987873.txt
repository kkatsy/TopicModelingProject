Selection Intensity in the Kota of Nilgiri Hills, Madras

Aloke Kumar Ghosh

Depariment of Anthropology
University of Calcutta, Calcutta, India

The Kota of the Nilgiri Hills, Madras,
are a small isolated tribe with a total population of 1,203. They are restricted to only
seven villages. A population-biological study
of this population was begun in 1966 with
a view to examining in detail its breeding
structure and the magnitude of the forces
like selection, drift, and admixture acting
upon it. The importance of such study has
been thoroughly discussed by a group of
scientific experts at Geneva (World Health
Organization, 1964).

In this communication, the data on selection intensity are given. A detailed report
of the present study will be published later.

The selection intensity in the Kota has
been calculated according to the following
formula (Crow, 1958):

I=In+I;/p.,
Lm = bal Pe y

I; = V;/#,

and

where & is the average number of live births
per woman aged 40 years and above; Vy is
variance in progeny number due to fertility;
pa is premature deaths (died before reproductive age, i.e., 15 years); p, = 1 â€” pas Im

is the mortality component; I; is the fertility
component; and 7 is the index of total
selection intensity. The index of total selection intensity measures the maximum potential rate of change by selection (where
O indicates no change) (Livingstone and
Spuhler, 1965).

Among the Kota the average number
of live births per woman aged 40 years or
more (%) is 3.73 and its variance (V;) is 8.87.
The total number of live births (V2) to the
women of all ages in the population and the
total number of premature deaths are 1,066
and 328 respectively, so that the frequency
of mortality before reproductive age, i.e.,
15 years (pz), is 30.8%. From these results
the mortality (7,,) and fertility (Z;) components are found to be 0.445 and 0.638, respectively, which give the index of total selection intensity (Z) as 1.367.

It thus appears that the mortality component of the total selection intensity is
smaller than the fertility component among
the Kota. In 5 out of 10 tribal populations
studied by Spuhler (1962), 1 out of 4 Caingang Indian populations studied by Salzano
(1963), and none out of 3 Pahira subpopulations studied by Basu (1967), I, is less

than Jy. The index of total selection intensity (I) among the Kota is more toward the
lower half of the range (0.6-3.7) observed
by Spuhler (1962) among the ten tribal
populations. It seems that among the Kota
selection is acting with a moderate intensity
and that differential postnatal mortality
accounts for only a small part of the total
opportunity for selection.
