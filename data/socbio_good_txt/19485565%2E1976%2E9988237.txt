Prevalence of Divorce Among Parents of
Children with Cystic Fibrosis and
Other Chronic Diseases

ABSTRACT: Data on the prevalence of divorce and separation among parents of children with
cystic fibrosis and other chronic diseases indicate that marital breakdown is no more prevalent
among these couples than it is in a general population. For couples who attended genetic
counseling clinics or had children with spina bifida or leukemia, the divorce rate is lower than the
United States national average. For parents of children with cystic fibrosis, the divorce rate is the
same as the national average. The high recurrence risk for cystic fibrosis may deter many parents
from further reproduction. We speculate that the inability to plan more children may be the factor
responsible for the higher prevalence of divorce among these parents compared to those of

children with other chronic diseases.

Many members of the medical community share the opinion that couples who
come for genetic counseling have a higher
prevalence of divorce than do couples in
the general population. This viewpoint
was reinforced when Sorenson (1972), in
reviewing the data of Carter and colleagues (1971), reported that the rate of
divorce for genetic counseling couples in
general was normal, but that it was three
times the national average for those
couples who reported that genetic counseling had changed their reproductive expectations. In an attempt to verify this statement, a thorough search of the medical
literature was undertaken. Although a
number of authors have briefly discussed
the incidence of divorce among parents of
children with chronic diseases and among
couples receiving genetic counseling, there
are no publications specifically directed to
the problem of divorce in these families.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate
the prevalence of divorce among couples

who have brought their children to the
Cystic Fibrosis Clinic at The Children’s
Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri,
and to collect and analyze the data of those
authors who have briefly discussed the incidence of divorce in their clinics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The sample studied was limited to the
parents of 34 children currently followed
in the Cystic Fibrosis Clinic of The Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City,
Missouri. All of the parents were interviewed by Michael Begleiter and were
asked to complete a one-page questionnaire designed to evaluate marital status
and whether the burden of raising a child
with cystic fibrosis had altered the marital
relationship.

Gibson, 1970; McCrae et al., 1973; Oakley
and Patterson, 1966; Reynolds et al., 1974;
Stehbens and Lascari, 1974; and Walker
et al., 1971) were used to determine the
prevalence of divorce and _ separation
among parents of children with chronic
diseases and among couples receiving genetic counseling. Although some of these
studies were of populations outside the
United States, divorce and separation data
were pooled with United States samples
and compared with the divorce statistics
for the general population of the United
States. With the limited data available in
the literature, our goal was simply to ascertain whether the rate of marital breakdown was unusually high in these families
as compared to that in a general population. The 1970 United States census (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 1970) was the
source of divorce statistics for the general
population.

RESULTS

Forty parents representing 31 families
were interviewed. In 9 instances, both the
mother and father were available for interviewing. In 3 families, there were 2 affected children. The parents ranged in age
from 18 to 43 years with a mean age of 30
years. They were interviewed from 3
months to 16 years after the diagnosis of
cystic fibrosis (CF) had been made, with
the mean length of time elapsed since the
diagnosis being 4.4 years. In 2 families,
divorce had occurred prior to the birth of
the CF child; these families were excluded
from the study.

There were § divorces in the 29 families,
giving a prevalance of divorce of 17.2 per
cent. In all families where divorce had
occurred, the parents felt that the problems associated with raising a child with
CF were not the cause of the divorce. In
addition, they did not feel that the CF
child had been a contributing factor in the

261

dissolution of their marriage. Two additional families had experienced a breakdown in communication regarding important family issues which created the “web
of silence” described by Turk (1964).
When asked if caring for the affected child
had brought the couple closer together, 5
parents felt it had not, 22 felt that it had,
and 6 saw no change in their relationship
with their spouses.

DISCUSSION

The prevalence of divorce in our CF
clinic families was 17.2 per cent. These
data are tabulated with those from other
cystic fibrosis clinics (Table 1) in the
United States and abroad. Divorces and
separations have been pooled for analysis
of marital breakdown. The proportion of
marital breakdown among the various
groups is homogeneous, as the heterogeneity chi-square is 8.90 with 5 degrees of
freedom. The pooled prevalence of marital
breakdown is 13.4 per cent, representing
45 instances of divorce or separation in a
sample of 335 couples.

For comparison, a similar analysis was
done from reviews of the literature on divorce or separation of couples who attended genetic counseling clinics (Table 2).
There were 20 instances of marital breakdown in 652 families (3.1 per cent). These
data were also homogeneous with respect
to rate among the sources (heterogeneity
chi-square = 2.19 with 2 degrees of freedom). This low figure is derived from
families with disorders of both low and
high recurrence risk. Data for a low recurrence risk disorder, spina bifida, are
also available (Table 3). In 312 families,
there were 9 divorces and no separations,
or a prevalence of 2.9 per cent. The pooled
data are also homogeneous (chi-square =
0.20 with 2 degrees of freedom).

marital breakdown has to be considered.
Four smaller studies of children with acute
leukemia are shown in Table 4. Two divorces and two separations occurred in
only one study of twenty families. A larger
study had no marital breakdowns. Pooling
these studies may not be legitimate, but
the number in the one study reporting
family dissolution is of the same order of
magnitude as that in the cystic fibrosis
data.

The impression that families with genetic disease have a higher risk of divorce
or separation than the general population
is clearly mistaken. According to the 1970
census (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1970),
14 per cent of men and 14.4 per cent of
women are known to have been divorced.
In the age group 25-35 years, the most
common age group of couples receiving
genetic counseling, the divorce rates are
11.9 per cent for men and 15.5 per cent for
women. The sample size of the pooled
data for cystic fibrosis parents is such that
there is no difference between the divorce
rate for these couples and the United
States national average. The rates for
couples who have children with spina
bifida or who have attended genetics
clinics are significantly lower.

The reason for this difference is not apparent. If one assumes that couples who
have received genetic counseling for a disease with a high risk of recurrence, like
CF, have a 13 per cent risk of marital
dissolution (Table 1) and couples with a
low risk disorder, like spina bifida, have a
3 per cent risk (Table 3), the projected
number of marital breakdowns for couples
in genetic counseling clinics (Table 2)
would be much higher in the British studies (Carter et al., 1971; Emery et al., 1973)
but the same in the American study
(Reynolds et al., 1974). However, the shift
would be significant only if applied to Carter’s data.

It is our speculation that being deterred
from further reproduction is the important
difference. Carter et al. (1971) demonstrated that the couples who are deterred
from further reproduction are at the greatest risk for marital breakdown. Among
our families, 24 of the 31 couples (77.4 per
cent) have had no further children since
the birth of their CF child. In one report of
a genetics clinic (Reynolds et al., 1974),
more than 75 per cent of the families received counseling for disorders with low
recurrence risks (less than 1 in 10 chance
of recurrence in future pregnancies). Spina
bifida families, and most couples receiving
genetic counseling, have low risks of re

currence for the disorders in their families.
It appears that the high risk of recurrence
of CF (1 in 4) has deterred many of our
families from further reproduction. This
inability to plan for further children may
be the factor responsible for the higher
prevalence of divorce among parents of
children with CF as compared to parents
of children with other chronic diseases.
