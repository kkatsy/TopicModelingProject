S ABSTRACT: Pregnancy histories of 470 ever-married women aged 40 years and older from three
a endogamous groups of marine fishermen of Puri, Orissa, are analyzed to estimate Crow’s index
of opportunity for selection. All these populations are migrants. The value of I ranges from 0.63
to 1.08. The results are interpreted in the light of their ethno-historical, migratory back"aegrounds, degree of isolation, and population sizes. A comparison with published Indian data is

S One of the underlying assumptions of
‘sthe genetic equilibrium model is the absence of selection. Selection is operative
“when individual members of the popula‘tion contribute disproportionately to
the next generation (Neel, 1958). The
extent to which natural selection can ocgeur in a population is measured by the
index of total selection (Crow, 1958),
‘gsince renamed the index of opportunity
go selection (Crow, 1966). A trait or a
Agene that is genetically correlated with
fitness will increase in proportion to this
correlation. The index, therefore, sets
an upper limit on the amount of genetically effective selection.

Reviewing the data from several populations of the world, Spuhler (1963,
1973, and 1976) observed that the selection intensity is positively correlated
with the technological advancement of
the populations. On the contrary, a review of thirty population samples, stud
ied so far in India (Reddy and Lakshmanudu, 1979) brings out that high
intensity of selection is detectable in a
few small and isolated populations including those in the tribal stage of economy and social organization. Thus,
there seems to be a need for more critical analysis of Indian populations of different sizes and of different stages of
economy.

The purpose of the present paper is,
therefore, to report estimates of selection potential from three endogamous
groups of marine fishermen of Puri, who
are migrants and are in different stages
of settlement and isolation. They are
still operating traditional boats and nets,
and the stage of their economy and subsistence leve] is comparable to that of
hunters and gatherers.

Marine fishermen at Puri, Orissa,

number about 13,000 individuals as permanent settlers. They formed into three

breeding isolates, namely: (1) Vadabalija of Penticotta (VP) who migrated
thirty years ago from the Visakapatnam,
East Godavari, and West Godavari districts of coastal Andhra Pradesh, (2) Vadabalija of Vadapeta (VV), and (3) Jalary (J). The latter two migrated a
century ago from the Srikakulam district
of Andhra Pradesh, and the contiguous
Ganjam district of Orissa. The admixture rate between the VP and VV at Puri
is about 1%, whereas, it is nil with the J
population. But there is still a large
amount of interaction with the parental
groups, especially in case of the VP. The
VP, VV, and J number roughly about
8,000, 4,000, and 800 individuals, respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data on the pregnancy outcomes of
218 ever-married women of the VP, 197
women of the VV, and 55 women of the
J populations who are aged 40 years and
over (collected during 1977 and 1978 as
a part of the project Genetical Demography and Variation among the Marine
Fishermen of the Puri Coast) are utilized for the present analysis. The samples also include women who died dur

ing the reproductive period (Neel and
Chagnon, 1968) and those widows and
divorced women whose ages were 35
years and above, because the prospect
of their remarriage and further reproduction is negligible. The index, J, is calculated using Crow’s (1958) formula.

RESULTS

Mean and variance of live births
along with the J,,, J, and J are presented
in Table 1. The mean live births are
strikingly similar in all these populations, though the variability is slightly
greater in the VP compared to the other
two populations. Another striking feature of the findings is that the value of [
increases as the population size decreases. Thus, the smallest population,
J, which is comparatively more isolated,
shows the highest value (J=1.078),
whereas the largest population, VP,
shows the smallest value (/=0.63). The
value of J}, does not differ widely among
these populations and follows the order
VP>VV>J, whereas J,, follows the reverse order with much wider differences. The contributions to the total index by the mortality and fertility
components are 55.5%/45.5%, 63.4%!/

36.6%, and 68.4%/31.6%, respectively,
among the VP, VV, and J populations.
Thus, in each of the three populations,
the mortality component is greater than
the fertility component and in the VV
and J populations it is about double that
of the fertility component. Thus, the
population variation in the index, J,-can
be almost totally attributed to the difference in the mortality rates.

The value of J in the VV and J populations is greater than the 25 and the 26
population estimates, respectively, of
the 30 Indian samples recorded in a review by Reddy and Lakshmanudu
(1979). In contrast, the value of J is
greater in the VP compared to only 16 of
the 30 sample estimates, Only, the two
samples from Kota, a tribal population
of Nilgiri Hills, with estimates of 2.25
and 1.37 (Ghosh, 1970, and Basu,
1972), Pardhan, a tribal population of
Adilabad district of Andhra Pradesh,
with 1.19 (Murthy and Ramesh, 1978),
and Northern Pahira from West Bengal
with 1.13 (Basu, 1967) exceed the potential for selection of that of the J population. The Manne Kolam tribe of Adilabad district (Murthy and Ramesh,
1978) exhibit a value equal to that of the
J population. Similar to the fishermen,
except for the Kota, all the above tribal
groups exhibit larger values of /,, than J).
On the other hand, while the estimate of
I among the VV is similar to that of
Bengali Muslims of Assam (Chakravarthy, 1976), Southern Pahira |
(Basu, 1967), and a section of Madiga of
Andhra Pradesh (Reddy and Lakshmanudu, 1979), the VP show a value
equal to that of the Varendra Brahmans
and similar to that of Jele fishermen and
Varendra Kayasthas from West Bengal
(Talukdar, 1977).

The lowest estimates of selection potential are, however, confined largely to

the different sections of Mala and Madiga populations of Andhra Pradesh
and Jatav of Utter Pradesh and Delhi
(Mukherjee, 1974), both of these
groups being scheduled castes (J ranges
from 0.24 to 0.48). The Raj Gonds and
Hill Kolam of Adilabad (Murthy and
Ramesh, 1978) and Southern Pehira II
of Dohna hills (Basu, 1967) exhibit intermediate values between that of the
VV and VP. Similar to the fishing
groups of the present study, all the tribal
groups with the exception of the Kota,
Hill Kolam, and Raj Gonds, show
greater values for J,, than J;. In general,
the nontribal groups, including the
scheduled castes, show a reverse trend.
Furthermore, the value of J in the VV
and J populations fall in the middle of
the range of variation for the populations of the world (Spuhler, 1976), while
the VP falls toward the lower extreme.

This is a situation in which three endogamous groups of fishermen migrated
to Puri at different points of time and are
in different stages of interaction with the
new eco-niche. One would, therefore,
surmise that these observed differences
in the index of selection potential were a
result of the adaptive processes in these
populations. The intermediate position
of the VV for J, between the ethnically
similar VP and historically sympatric J
populations, and the convergence of
VV toward J in anthropometric and
other traits which are more eco-sensitive
(Reddy, 1981), might further strengthen
this conjecture.

The larger value of J, in a smaller and
more isolated population, J, agrees with
the similar observation made earlier
(Reddy and Lakshmanudu, 1979) on Indian data. The observed greater value of
the mortality component compared to
the fertility component is very much expected in these populations as in tribal

or less advanced societies. They are
characterized by a very poor accessibility to modern medical facilities, no deliberate birth control measures, and low
social mobility. Furthermore, most of
the infantile deaths are reported to have
occurred due to infectious disease.
