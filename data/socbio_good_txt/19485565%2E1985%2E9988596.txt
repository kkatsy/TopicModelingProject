Special Occasions, Stress, and Mortality:
Do People Tend to Die During Their Birth Month?

ABSTRACT: Data from the 1966-68 U.S. National Mortality Survey show more deaths during
the birth month than in any other month for persons aged 35-84 at death. This effect is even
greater for cardiovascular disease victims and shown to be statistically significant according toa
log linear model. Another statistically significant effect is the interaction between marital status
and month of death. The nonmarried group has a larger month effect than does the married
group. These results point to an explanation of the birthday as a stressful event, which is demonstrated by an interaction between the month of death and whether or not the death was cardiovascular related. The status of being married however, seems to protect an individual from
the birthday’s negative effect. The variables of sex and living arrangements, according to the log
linear model, do not have statistically significant interaction effects with month of death.

Phillips and Feldman (1973) see the
birthday as one of many social ceremonies that can influence the timing of
one’s death. Their theoretical explanation of this phenomenon ts derived from
Durkheim’s (1951) work on suicide,
where Durkheim connected social integration with participation in social ceremonies. Durkheim hypothesized that an
individual who is extremely isolated
from society may react by committing
suicide. Phillips and Feldman (1973)
suggest that the reverse phenomenon
may also exist: A person who is highly
integrated into society may postpone
death in order to participate in a social
ceremony. They claim that famous people (selected as a highly integrated
group) are more likely to exhibit a dip in
deaths before their birthdays because of
the great attention given to these events.
Phillips and Feldman found a statistically significant dip in deaths in the
month before the birth month and a statistically significant peak during the cal
endar birth month and the subsequent
three months. The size of the peaks and
dips varied directly with fame, that is,
the more famous the individuals in the
groups, the larger the dip and peak.
Alderson (1975) extended the analysis to include demographic factors
thought to be related to social integration. Using mortality data from England
and Wales for 1972, he predicted that
age, sex, and marital status were also associated with birthday effects. Younger
age groups did not exhibit a statistically
significant relationship between the
birth month and death month, but for
persons aged 75 and over, such a relation
was found. This relation included ‘‘a deficiency of observed deaths in the
months preceding the birth month, and
an excess of deaths in the birth month
and the following few months.” The excess was greater for men than for
women. When looking at marital status,
the lowest excess of deaths was found
among the widowed persons. Alderson

hypothesizes that one’s birthday can
bring stress, particularly to an older person, by reminding the person that he or
she has less time on earth.

Schulz and Bazerman (1980) claim
that the findings of both Alderson and
Phillips and Feldman resulted from
methodological flaws. Upon reanalysis,
the data from each study did not support
a dip in deaths before the birthday or a
rise after the birthday. Phillips and Feldman used calendar months as the time
unit of analysis. When Schulz and Bazerman instead looked at deaths during
the 31-day period before the birthday
they found practically no dip. Likewise,
there was no Statistically significant rise
in deaths during the 31-day period after
the birthday. Subsequent 31-day periods did show larger than expected numbers of deaths, however, Phillips and
Feldman’s hypothesis implies that the
death peak effects should be greatest
immediately after the birthday. Schulz
and Bazerman next demonstrate that
Alderson’s findings of a birthday effect
for only those over age 75 were due primarily to the relatively high mortality at
older ages. The number of persons at
risk of dying at a given age is greatest immediately after the birthday and decreases until the next birthday, so it follows that more deaths should be
expected right after the birthday and
similarly fewer deaths before the birthday. This bias is most severe for older
ages, which is why Schulz and Bazerman
claim Alderson found a cyclical pattern
of deaths only for persons over age 75
and no such pattern in younger populations.

Kobrin and Hendershot (1977) link
social integration and mortality. They
found that mortality rates are “lower for

persons; lower for married persons with
children than for those without children
and lower for non-married persons who
are household heads than for those who
are not heads.” They explain their findings in terms of a social protection hypothesis, rather than a selection hypothesis, and believe that certain social
statuses (like marriage and parenthood)
give protection from mortality.

The other line of research relevant to
this study concerns stress, mortality,
and life events. Selye (1976) defines
stress as ‘‘the nonspecific response of the
body to any demand. Stress can be both
helpful (eustress) and harmful (distress). For example, the dip in deaths
the month before the birth month that
Phillips and Feldman (1973) found can
be due to eustress—“‘the will to live” —
while the peak in deaths during the birth
month exemplifies possible distress.
Life events, such as divorce or the birth
of a child, have been shown to produce
distress, although the relationship between undesirable life events and stress
may not be as great as postulated by
some (see Thoits 1981, for a review).
Stress (or to be more precise, distress)
has been clearly linked with mortality,
particularly cardiovascular disease
(Wolf and Goodell, 1968, provide a review). Reynolds (1974) has categorized
life events which cause stress, and
among these categories is certainty.
There is nothing as certain as one’s
birthday. People can never be sure
when they will die or how much money
they will have to pay in taxes, but they
do know that on a specific date every
year they will be one year older.

This study will provide a more complete socio-biological explanation of the
relation between the birth month and
death month. The birthday may be an

undesirable event and therefore cause
distress for some people. However, its
impact depends on the significance society and the individual place on the occasion itself and on the process of aging, as
well as the degree of social integration
experienced by the individual. Unlike
Phillips and Feldman, I will look at the
ordinary population, not just the famous persons. I will extend Alderson’s
study to include cause of death and lIiving arrangements of the decedent, as
well as sex and marital status'. Persons
under age 75 will also be included in the
sample in order to overcome the methodological flaw Schulz and Bazerman
discovered in Alderson’s work.

The extent of the relation between
the birth month and the death month
should be associated with other variables known to be linked with stress and
mortality. For example, cardiovascular
deaths, since they have been shown to
be related to stress should be more sensitive to the month effect than deaths
due to other causes. Persons living alone
may be more ill-affected (i.e., higher
peak in deaths during the birth month)
because they are not afforded as much
social protection as those living with relatives or other people. Likewise, nonmarried persons should show a greater
sensitivity to the month effect than do
married persons. Finally, because gender is such an important determinant of
mortality in general, the birthday effect
for males may be different than the
birthday effect for females.

Preliminary analysis of month of death by age
showed no clear pattern. Unlike Alderson’s sample, the older persons in this sample (ages 65~74
and 75-84) were not more likely to die during the
birth months than were younger persons in the
sample.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data for this analysis were taken
from the 1960-68 U.S. National Mortality Survey, a stratified sample of persons
35-84 years of age who died in 1966-68.
Information concerning the decedent
was obtained both from the death certtficate and from a questionnaire sent to
the death record informant named on
the death certificate. Only cases coded
“adequate” with respect to data quality,
the highest ranking, were selected for
analysis, resulting in a sample size of
15,949 out of 19,526 original cases.

Unfortunately this study cannot examine deaths 31 days before the birthday and 31 days after the birthday, as
Schulz and Bazerman did in the reanalysis of the Phillips and Feldman data, because only the calendar month of birth
was recorded in the survey. Deaths were
recorded by both day and month, but
again only the calendar month is used
here. With this constraint, it is not possible to know if the decedent died before
or after the birthday when the death occurs during the birth month. It would be
more accurate to say then, that this paper analyzes a birth month effect rather
than a birthday effect. It can be argued
that the calendar month during which
one’s birthday falls has a special significance, even when the birthday comes at
the very beginning or end of the month.
Often times, we are asked the month
and year of our birth, but not the day.
Even though the month of birth may not
be as important as the birthday itself, it
still may hold some significance for an
individual. Perhaps Phillips and Feldman actually discovered a birth month
effect, since Schulz and Bazerman refuted the birthday hypothesis.

All of the data presented here show

Vol. 32, No. 1-2

the month of death in relation to the
month of birth, not as a month in the calendar year. The difference between the
death month and the birth month is —1
if death occurred in the calendar month
prior to the birth date, even though the
difference between the birth and death
dates could range, in this case, from 1 to
61 days. In the figures, the lower bound
for the difference is five months before
the birth month and the upper bound is
six months after, so that a difference of
zero (death occurred in the same calendar month as the birth) falls in the center. For example, someone who was
born in January and died in December
would be in the “fone month before” category, as would someone born in June
who died in May. Fortunately, the seasonal variation in mortality does not
overlap with the slight seasonal variation in fertility to cause a deviation from
the expected pattern of !/12 of the deaths
occurring in each month.

A five-way contingency table was
produced: month of death, by cause
(cardiovascular, other causes)’, by sex
(male, female), by marital status (married, non-married), by living arrangements (alone, with relatives, other). A
log linear analysis (using the program,
Loglin, designed by Olivier and Neff,
1976) was perfomed on the five-way
contingency table of 288 cells.

RESULTS

rheumatic heart, nonrheumatic endocarditis and
other myocardial degeneration, and other diseases
of the heart and circulatory system.

deaths in each month (relative to the
birth month) by cause of death, sex,
marital status, and living arrangements.
The per cent of deaths each month for
the total sample is included in each
figure for comparison. A first glance at
each figure indicates that there seems to
be a month effect. Specifically, we can
see that there are more deaths during
the birth month than any other month
for the total sample and for each subgroup. Moreover, there appears to be a
differential month effect for each variable examined.

Those dying of cardiovascular disease exhibit a large dip in deaths the
month before the birth month, unlike
those dying of causes not cardiovascular
related (Figure 1). During the birth
month, the cardiovascular deaths contribute to a higher peak than do the
deaths due to other causes.

No subgroup other than the cardiovascular deaths shows a strong dip in
deaths the month before the birth
month. Generally, the per cent of
deaths during this month is below the
expected value of 8.3 per cent, but often
it is not the lowest value of all months.
For example, in Figure 2, we can see
that the males have the lowest per cent
of deaths during the second and fourth
months after the birth month, even
though the per cent of deaths in the
month before the birth month is 8.1, below the expected value of 8.3 per cent.
There are, however, differences in the
height of the peak during the birth
month. Females have a higher peak
than males (Figure 2), while nonmarried
persons have a much higher peak in
deaths during the birth month than do
the married (Figure 3). Those persons
living alone have the highest per cent of
deaths during the birth month and those

deaths during the birth month than any
other month (Figure 4). Those in other
living arrangements, such as in institutions or households with nonrelatives,
are the intermediate category.

These preliminary findings appear to
support both a stress explanation as well
as a social-protection explanation. The
birthday seems to be a stressful occasion, as it affects cardiovascular deaths
more than those of other causes. Certain
subgroups of the population, however,

like married persons or those living with
relatives, may be protected from its ill
effects. Men may be less affected by
birthdays than women, since our society
gives women less status as they age.
While these initial results are encouraging, a multivariate analysis to con
sider simultaneously the effects of all
four factors (cause, sex, marital status,
living arrangements) on the month of
death is required, such as a hierarchical
model of multivariate contingency tables (see Davis, 1974) for explanation of
the method). This type of analysis can

Tables 1 and 2 show the results of the
log linear analysis. Table 1 lists 10 hierarchical models. Each model has multiple terms, which are separated by a
slash. If a term has r variables, all -—1 and
lower order interactions involving those
variables are also included in the model
being tested. For example, Model C has

seven terms and tests one four-way interaction and every possible three-way,
two-way, and one-way effect, including
those implied by the term (1235). The
first step is to test models with increasingly higher order terms (all main effects, then all one-way interactions,
etc.) until one fits, i.e., a chi square is

dependent variable (month of death).
The two-way interaction term (25) was
found to be nonsignificant. Models D
through K include various combinations
of the two-way effects (15), (35), and
(45) along with (1234). While it appears
that the (15) term is necessary to include
in the model, it is not entirely clear from
Table 1 if either (35) or (45) or both are
Statistically significant.

Table 2 shows a more reliable way to
test the individual two-way effects. Beginning with Model D, we examined the
effect of deleting each two-way term.
Model E is Model D without the (15)
term. By subtracting the chi-square
value of Model D from Model E, and
similarly the degrees of freedom, we can
determine the significance of the (15)
term. Here, a probability value less than
0.05 indicates that the term being deleted is significant and should be included. When the terms (35) and (45)
were deleted individually from Model
D, they were found to be nonsignificant
(probability values of 0.36 and 0.33, respectively). However, when they were
deleted at the same time, the probability
value dropped sharply (to p=0.09), so
further testing was done.

Model G includes the (15) and (35)
effects along with the (1234) effect.
Both two-way terms are significant to
the model, although the probability
value for the (35) term (p=0.046) is
close to 0.05. Model F includes the (15),
(45), and (1234) effects, but not the (35)
effect. Again the (15) effect is shown to
be necessary to the model, but the (45)
term can be dropped. The final conclusion to draw from this analysis is that the
hierarchical model that best meets the
criteria of good fit and parsimony is
(1234/15/35). The resulting equation of
this best fitting model is

In other words, there is a four-way interaction (as well as all lower order interactions) among Variables 1, 2,3, and
4; a two-way interaction between Variables 1 and 5; and a two-way interaction
between Variables 3 and 5. The twoway interaction terms also include the
single variable effects of Variables 1, 3,
and 5.

The four-way effect shown here
means that cause of death, sex, marital
status, and living arrangements are all
interdependent, a finding which is neither surprising nor relevant to this
study. The more interesting results are
the interaction between cause of death
and month of death (Variables 1 and 5)
and the interaction between marital status and month of death (Variables 3 and
5). Of course, the one-way month effect
is also significant, as it is included in both
two-way terms.

The effect estimates, given by the u
terms in Equation (2), show the relative
likelihood of being in one category versus another (see Table 3). The main effect of the variable, month of death,
shows that the birth month category has
a higher expectancy than the category
one month before it by a factor of
exp(0.19—(0.04)), or 1.26. The risk of
dying during the birth month is 26 per
cent greater than the risk of dying the
previous month. The next two panels of
Table 3 show the interaction effects

person dying during the birth month is
greater than that of a married person by
a factor of 1.17, above and beyond the
overall finding of a greater risk of dying
during the birth month.

When looking at the effect estimates
for the interaction of cause and month,
we see two interesting results. First of
all, for those dying of cardiovascular disease, death is more likely during the
birth month than the month before it by
a factor of 1.15. Secondly, the effect of
dying during the birth month is greater
for the cardiovascular disease victims by
a factor of 1.08. Both of these effects are
in addition to the main birth month effect of marriage.

many more deaths during the birth
month than in the other eleven months.
Moreover, the month effect is associated with both cause of death and marital status, giving support to both the
stress hypothesis and the socialprotection hypotheses. The birth month
does indeed seem to have an effect on
the timing of death, particularly for
those dying of cardiovascular-related
causes. These individuals exhibit a dip in
deaths the month before the birth
month and a peak during the birth
month. Additionally, married persons
appear to have some protection from
the distress during the birth month.
Another explanation for the interaction between month of death and marital status could be reporting error.
There may be a tendency for the deathrecord informant to fill in the same

month for both birth and death if he or
she was not sure of the decedent’s exact
birth month. If the decedent were married, the death record informant would
probably be the spouse who should
know the birth month. The death record
informant of anonmarried person, however, may not know this information. If
reporting errors on the birth month
were widespread, then perhaps the variable “living arrangements,” rather than
marital status would have been significantly associated with the month of
death. Those persons living alone or
with nonrelatives would be subject to a
reporting error, perhaps even more so
than the nonmarried. More importantly, cardiovascular disease victims
should not have any greater reporting
error bias than those who died of other
causes. Report errors, then, can not
provide a more credible explanation for
either the interaction observed between
marital] status and month of death, or
the interaction observed between cause
and month of death.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

While some social ceremonies are
observed by an entire society, such as
presidential elections of Christmas, the
birthday goes noticed by only the individual and those close to him or her. It is
a time when a person is singled out and
lauded (which is desirable), and simultaneously it is a reminder of advancing age
(an undesirable effect). This analysis
links the birth month effect with both
stress and social integration, unlike the
two other studies noted. Phillips and
Feldman (1973) did examine the effect
of varying degrees of social integration
by assuming persons with higher degrees of fame were more socially inte

grated, but it can also be argued that famous persons without close family ties
may not be well integrated socially. The
family and household provide individuals with the most immediate form of
social integration, which Kobrin and
Hendershot (1977) demonstrate can affect general mortality trends. It is therefore likely that family and household
ties can buffer the distress during the
birth month as well as protect individuals from mortality in general. Unlike
Phillips and Feldman, Alderson (1975)
did attempt to explain the birthday effect in terms of an immediate social support theory. However, as Schulz and
Bazerman (1980) point out, his findings
of a birthday effect for only the very elderly are due to a methodological flaw.
Neither of the studies examined cause of
death, which in this analysis, shows that
stress (modified by the degree of social
support) can be a major factor in explaining the strength of the birth month
effect.

For this sample of ordinary persons,
the birthday does not appear to postpone death to any great extent, except in
the case of cardiovascular disease victims. The cardiovascular disease victims
experienced a larger dip in deaths the
month before the birth month, and a
Jarger peak in deaths during the birth
months, thus implying that the birth
month is a stressful period, because cardiovascular disease ts clearly linked with
stress.

The status of being married, however, seems to protect an individual
from stress during the birth month. A
married person gains emotional support
from his or her spouse, which can help
make the birthday a pleasant celebration rather than a dreary reminder that
one’s years left on earth are dwindling.

A person’s living arrangements do not
appear to provide any additional protection during the birth month, once marital status is taken into account. Males
and females do not exhibit any statistically significant differences in the timing
of death.

Future research on this topic should
first address the issue of possible reporting error bias. Data would have to be
collected where the month of birth was
asked independently of the month of
death (i.e., while the decedent was still
alive). Life insurance records may provide good data and so could a continuous population registration system, as in
Sweden. It would also be preferable to
use data where the days of both birth
and death are recorded. Related areas

Social Biology

of inquiry, such as medical sociological
research, could also be pertinent, where
studies could be done to determine how
a person’s mental and physical health is
affected by his or her birthday.
