Relative Fecundability of Users
and Nonusers of Contraception

To evaluate the impact of family-planning programs, it is important to know
whether or not women who voluntarily
accept sterilization or contraceptive methods have higher fecundability than those
who do not accept them.! If the acceptors
do have higher monthly probabilities of
conceiving than other women of their age
class, then the program Is likely to avert
more future births, Measuring the fecundability differentials for older women is especially important since they make up the
bulk of the acceptors in the early stages of a
program.

Questions regarding the fecundability
differences between users of contraception
and nonusers have been raised by demographers interested in family-planning programs. Freedman and Takeshita (1969),
have concluded that acceptors probably
have higher fecundability than nonacceptors. Their conclusion was based on indirect
evidence, such as the fact that the acceptors
in their study had higher fertility than nonacceptors for as long as ten years prior to
interview, suggesting high fecundability.

1In demographic literature, fecundity is used to
denote the physiological capacity of women to produce a live birth, fertility is 2a measure based on the

actual number of live births, and fecundability refers
to the monthly probability of conceiving.

In the present analysis it will be shown
that the users of birth control techniques
had higher fecundability at marriage than
nonusers and that women with higher
initial fecundability became acceptors in the
family-planning program studied. This is an
independent test of the conclusion reached
by Freedman and Takeshita, although both
analyses are based on data taken from an
intensive fertility survey (for details, see
Jain, 1968; Freedmen and Takeshita, 1969)
conducted in Taichung City of Taiwan at
the end of 1962 prior to a year-long familyplanning program (see Berelson and Freedman, 1964). These women were then reinterviewed at the end of 1963 after the completion of the program. The data are based
on a probability sample of 2,443 married
women aged 20-39 living with their husbands at the time of interview. From a
later survey, we also know whether or not
these women became acceptors by July 1,
1965. Of the 17% of women accepting contraception, about 78% accepted IUCD’s
and the rest chose traditional methods,

and period following the termination of a
pregnancy. Average fecundability for a
group of heterogeneous women can be estimated on the basis of a Type I geometric
model (Jain, 1968, 1969; Potter and Parker,
1964) which is based on the following four
assumptions:

1. Conception is a random event.

2. Fecundability “f” of each couple
remains constant from month to month until
conception.

3. Fecundability among couples is distributed according to a Pearsonian Type I dis
tribution.
4, The number of couples is adequate.

Under these assumptions, the average and
variance of fecundability for a group of
women are given by the following expressions:

p = a/a+b (1)

and
Vip) = ab/(a + ba +5+ 1), (2)

where a@ and 6 are two parameters in
Pearson’s Type I distribution, and their
values are estimated from the observed
frequency distribution of first pregnancy
interval—the period between the onset of
marriage and the beginning of first conception. For this purpose, women who were
definitely premaritally pregnant (158) or
had used contraception during the first
pregnancy interval (29) or did not conceive
even once prior to first interview (66) are
excluded.

The Type I geometric model has been
tested elsewhere (Jain, 1968, 1969) for the
remaining 2,190 women taken together, and
after controlling their age at marriage. For
this purpose, the observed number of women
conceiving during each successive month after marriage was compared with the corresponding theoretical values obtained on
the assumption of the Type I geometric
model. The statistically insignificant values
of chi-square at the 5% level of significance
showed that the differences between the
observed and theoretical number of women

conceiving during each successive month
following marriage could have arisen due to
random fluctuation. On this basis it was
concluded that the Type I geometric model
fits all women in the sample quite well as
well as subgroups, and that the values of
p and V(p) can be used as reliable estimates
of the average and variance of fecundability
at marriage for women in this sample.

In the present analysis we have estimated
the averages and variances of fecundabilities for different subgroups on the assumption that the Type I geometric model fits
these subgroups as well. This assumption
has not been tested empirically for the subgroups used here. For simplicity, the estimated averages and variances of fecundabilities are shown in terms of 1,000 women
instead of per woman.

RESULTS

Table 1 shows the average fecundabilities
with their standard errors for acceptors and
nonacceptors as of July 1, 1965. Those
couples sterilized by the second interview
(end of 1963) are shown separately. The
acceptors are subclassified by whether or
not they had used contraception and/or
induced abortion after the first pregnancy
but prior to first interview (1962). Nonacceptors are also subclassified into two groups
according to their contraceptive status
prior to first interview. In all, we have
divided the couples into five categories.

In Table 1, the average fecundabilities
are shown in absolute terms as well as indices relative to the fecundability level for
all women. It has been shown elsewhere
(Jain, 1968, 1969) that the estimated average fecundability for all women is deflated
as a result of memory biases in reporting
the early pregnancy losses and in misreporting the dates of marriage and that it is
inflated as a consequence of truncation bias
resulting from the fact that the interview
date curtailed the childbearing period of
women included in the sample. Both these

biases were found to be associated with the
length of marriage duration; the truncation
bias was found to be operating mainly
during the first three years of marriage,
whereas the effect of memory bias was found
to be increasing with ascending marriage
duration. Since the marriage duration is
closely associated with the age of women at
the first interview, we can roughly control
for the effects of these biases by dividing
women into two broad age groups, 20-29
and 30-39. For this reason, the results in
Table 1 are shown for all ages as well as for
these two broad age groups.

The average fecundability of those acceptors who had previously used contraception
is about 9% higher than for all women and
about 19% higher than the average for
those nonacceptors who had not used contraception prior to the first interview. This
table understates the fecundability differentials because women without any pregnancies have been excluded. These women
undoubtedly had lower fecundability, and
that is why they did not conceive even once
prior to the first interview. All these 66
women belong to the fifth category. Inclusion of these women would substantially
lower the average fecundability estimates
for this group as well as for all women.

The fecundability of women who had not
conceived cannot be estimated directly.
We estimate it indirectly in two different
ways: (1) by assuming that their average
fecundability is equal to the average fecundability of all women who conceived at
least once prior to interview, and (2) by
assuming that these women are primarily
sterile and hence their average fecundability is zero. Their actual average fecundability probably is between these two extremes. However, it will be closer to the
lower limit than to the upper limit since
more than 50% of these women had not
conceived during five years of marriage.
We can now obtain the weighted average
fecundabilities of all women, including those

Fecundability and Contraception 41

who had not conceived even once prior to
the first interview. The upper limits are
shown in Table 1, and the lower limits are
shown in Table 2.

Since we have assumed an average of zero
for estimating the lower limits, and since
individual women cannot have negative
fecundability, the variance of fecundabilities
for these 66 women can also be assumed to
be zero. Assuming that all these primarily
sterile women will fall into the fifth category
as they do in this sample, the overall standard errors are computed by pooling the data
of the two groups. The standard errors thus
estimated are quite close to those shown in
Table 1 and hence are not shown again in
Table 2.

Those acceptors who had previously
used contraception had an initial fecundability about 12% higher than the average,
whereas those nonacceptors who had not
used contraception prior to the first interview had an initial fecundability about 9%
lower than the average for all women (see
Table 2). The average fecundabilities of the
other three groups of women are between
these two extremes. The trend is consistent
whether we consider women aged 20-29 or
30-39, The absolute values of average fecundabilities for younger women are higher than
for older women, probably mainly because
of the memory bias, but partly due to the
truncation bias.

DISCUSSION

The above analysis shows that those
acceptors who had previously used contraception had an initial fecundability about
25% higher than those nonacceptors who
had not used contraception prior to interview. This result, along with Freedman and
Takeshita’s finding (1969) that acceptors
had higher recent fertility than nonacceptors, indicates that acceptors not only had
higher fecundability at marriage, but they
also had higher fecundability at the time of
interview. Two important practical implica

tions of this result are: (1) The impact of the
program is greater than would be expected
on the assumption that acceptors have the
same fecundability as nonacceptors; the
acceptors have a greater potential for producing births than the other women with
lower fecundability. (2) Even if older women
with higher parity are more likely to accept
the IUCD or other contraceptive methods
in a family-planning program, it is worthwhile to invest resources in such a program
because these women have the potential to
produce substantially more births than the
average women of their age class. This does
not imply that these acceptors would not
have adopted some method of birth control

in the absence of an organized family-planning program. It is probable, however, that
a greater proportion of them will adopt
contraception and adopt it earlier in an organized program. Even small gains in proportion and timing may represent a significant number of births averted in a group
with such high fecundability.
