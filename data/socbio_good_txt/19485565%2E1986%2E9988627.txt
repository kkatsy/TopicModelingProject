Reproductive Success and Occupational Class
in Eighteenth-century Lancashire, England

ABSTRACT: Data from parish registers on 182 couples married between 1754 and 1772 in Lancashire, England, were used to compare lifetime reproductive success of farmers and craftsmen.
Farmers were expected to be of higher average status and wealth than craftsmen; thus, these
data were used to test the hypothesis that status and reproductive success were positively correlated in this society. Farmers raised a significantly higher mean number of children to age 21
than did craftsmen, although mean numbers of children born to farmers and craftsmen were
not significantly different. The proportion of children surviving to age 21 was significantly

higher for farmers than for craftsmen.

Some authors have argued that behavioral adaptations enabling the individual to obtain or control resources
have been important in human evolution (e.g., Barash, 1979; Wilson, 1978).
If so, one would predict that for most of
human evolutionary history, the quality
of resources controlled must have been
correlated with reproductive success.
However, it is often stated that there is
no correlation between wealth and reproductive success in “advanced” societies (e.g., MacDonald, 1983). Indeed,
quite a few studies have found a negative relationship between social class
and fertility in twentieth-century industrial society (e.g., Wrong, 1958). On the
other hand, Irons (1979) shows a correlation between number of children born
and wealth in a present-day polygynous
society. Also, historical studies have
suggested that mean numbers of children born in families of high social class
were higher than mean numbers of children born in families of low social class
in certain monogamous societies in the
past. Razi (1980) provides such data for

medieval England, while Smith (1977)
presents similar data for Tokugawa, Japan, although in neither case were the
data analyzed statistically. Similar
results have been reported for some
modern agrarian societies (e.g., Davis,
1951).

Because humans are long-lived organisms with a long period of immaturity,
the number of children born to an individual or a couple is not a good estimate
of reproductive success when childhood
mortality is substantial. A truer measure
of reproductive success is the number of
children raised to maturity. Short-term
ethnographic studies or cross-sectional
studies of vital records cannot provide
data on number of children raised to
maturity, but historical records can. In
this paper, I present a preliminary analysis of the relationship between occupational class, which is assumed to be
roughly correlated with economic wellbeing, and reproductive success in an
historical society, eighteenth-century
Lancashire, England.

the usefulness of English parish records
as tools in historical demography. Usually, these records are used to answer
questions posed at the population level
(e.g., questions about rates of birth or
mortality). These records can also be
used to follow the reproductive careers
of individuals or married couples. As a
result of Lord Hardwicke’s Act of 1754,
which promulgated a standard format
for the recording of marriages, many
parish records after that date record the
groom’s occupation. Occupations are
sometimes also listed in records of burials. Comparison of marriage and burial
records for the same individuals suggests that there was little opportunity for
change in occupational class in English
rural society in the eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries. Thus, parish records provide evidence on differences
between occupational classes with respect to reproductive parameters.

In this paper, I compare two broad
occupational classes with respect to a
number of variables relating to reproductive strategy and reproductive success. These occupational classes are (1)
farmers, listed on the registers as “‘husbandman” or “yeoman”; and (2) craftsmen, including skilled trades such as
weaver, tailor, cobbler, carpenter, etc.
By far the majority of married couples
whose reproductive careers I was able to
trace belonged to either of these two
classes. Individuals of lower class, listed
in the registers as “laborers,” accounted
for relatively few recorded marriages;
frequently, even when marriages of laborers were recorded, the individual
soon disappeared from the records.
These observations are consistent with a
pattern of infrequent church marriage
(cf. Newman, 1980) and high geographical mobility (cf. Maltby, 1971) in the laborer class. Marriages of gentry were

Social Biology

also infrequently found in the registers,
apparently because gentry constituted a
small portion of the population.

In peasant societies throughout the
world, farmers are generally considered
to be of higher status and prosperity
than the craftsmen serving them (who
may have smaller landholdings) (see,
for example, Jay, 1969; Mayer, 1966;
Rees, 1950). Gregory King in 1690
ranked farmers above craftsmen in status and income in England at that time
(Laslett, 1971). In the mid-twentieth
century, Williams (1956), in a study of
an English country village, likewise
ranked farmers above craftsmen in status. Thus, I predicted that farmers
would have greater reproductive success
on the average than craftsmen and used
data from Lancashire parish records to
test this prediction.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data were obtained from the registers for eight Lancashire parishes
(Brierley, 1911, 1912; Cheetham and
Sparke, 1934; Chippindall, 1931, 1932,
1933; Clayton, 1910; Farrer, 1911). In
these registers, the occupation of the
groom was consistently recorded for
marriages from 1754 on. I examined all
marriages recorded for the years 1754~
72 in which the groom was not a widower and for which the groom’s occupation was recorded. Baptisms of children
and deaths of family members were then
traced. I included in my data sample
only families for which there was strong
evidence of the family’s remaining in the
parish at least as long as the twenty-first
anniversary of the baptism of the youngest child. Such evidence involved unambiguous mention of the parents (e.g., at
their burials, because of their serving as
churchwardens or baptismal sponsors,

or because of their being 1n arrears for
tithes) or unambiguous mention of the
children (e.g., their burials or marriage
in the parish). Most registers contain entries through 1812 and a few for one or
two years after that. Three families resulting from marriages toward the end
of the study period were excluded from
my sample because the twenty-first anniversary of the baptism of the youngest
child occurred after the last year for
which records were available for the
parish.

I excluded two cases in which a second marriage by a man produced children as well as the first. (In a few other
cases, a second marriage by a widower
occurred but was childless.) I also excluded all cases of entirely childless marriage, since I was interested in reproductive strategies. The study sample
contained 182 couples. In 112 cases, the
husband was a farmer, while in 70 he
was a craftsman. For each case, I recorded the date of baptism (and birth,
when that was also given) and sex of all
children. (When dates of both birth and
baptism were recorded, the latter usually occurred within about two weeks.)
Each child’s death was recorded if it occurred prior to the twenty-first anniversary of baptism. This anniversary was
chosen as an estimate of age of indepen

dence from the parents and reproductive competence. Of course, not all individuals living to age 21 eventually
reproduced, as evidenced by occasional
deaths of young adults prior to reproduction. In fact, there was evidence that
the average age of marriage for both
sexes was well above 21 (see below).
Nonetheless, the number of children
raised to age 21 represents an estimate
of the parents’ reproductive success,
analogous to estimates used in many
studies of nonhuman animals, which are
often based on number of young raised
to independence.

For each case, I also estimated the
childbearing span. This was defined as
the date of baptism of the youngest child
minus the date of marriage, rounded to
the nearest year. When either parent or
both was born in the parish and there
was a record of that individual’s baptism, I calculated the bride’s and/or
groom’s age at marriage in years. I had
data on the age at marriage of both bride
and groom for 31 farmer couples and 20
craftsman couples.

RESULTS

As shown in Table 1, the mean number of children born to farmer couples in
the sample was slightly higher than the

mean number of children born to craftsman couples, but the difference was not
significant. The mean number of children surviving to age 21 was significantly
higher for farmer couples than for
craftsman couples. Likewise, the proportion of children surviving to age 21
was significantly higher for farmer couples than for craftsman couples. Mean
childbearing span was slightly higher for
farmer couples than for craftsman couples, but the difference was not significant.

All of the variables considered in Table 1 were tntercorrelated and, as suggested by the data here, related to occupational class. I used partial correlation
to assess independent effects on both
the number of children surviving to age
21 and the proportion of children surviving to age 21, of each of the following
predictor variables: number of children
born, childbearing span, and occupational class (scored as a dummy variable, 0 = craftsman, 1 = farmer). Table
2 shows second-order partials between
each of these predictor variables and
both number of children surviving to age
21 and proportion of children surviving
to age 21, simultaneously controlling for

the other two predictor variables. All
three predictor variables were found to
have significant independent correlation
with the number of children surviving to
age 21. Not surprisingly, there was a
strong positive partial correlation between the number of children born and
the number of children surviving to age
21. Childbearing span and occupational
class both showed more modest but
significant positive partial correlation
with the number of children surviving to
age 21. There were small but significant
positive partial correlations between the
proportion of children surviving to age
21 and both childbearing span and occupational class.

For the 51 couples for which both
husband’s and wife’s age at marriage
were known, I calculated the age difference between husbands and wifes. The
mean age difference was 7.81 yrs
(S.D. = 11.37) for farmers and 1.95 yrs
(S.D. = 6.85) for craftsmen. The variance in age difference for farmers was
significantly higher than that for craftsmen (P<0.05). Thus, I tested for
equality of means by Welch’s approximate f-test. Mean age difference between groom and bride was found by

this criterion to be significantly higher
for farmers than for craftsmen
(P< 0.015). Variance in husband’s age
at marriage was also significantly greater
for farmers than for craftsmen
(P <6.025). By Welch’s approximate
test, mean age at marriage of the husband was greater for farmers (33.87,
S.D. = 12.16) than for craftsmen
(29.00, S.D. = 7.10; P<0.05). Mean
age at marriage of the wives of farmers
(26.06, S.D. = 5.96) and craftsmen
(27.05,S.D. = 5.94) did not differ significantly.

Both husband’s age at marriage and
wife’s age at marriage were positively
correlated with childbearing span in the
51 cases for which these ages were
known. However, the first-order partial
correlation between childbearing span
and husband’s age at marriage was not
significantly different from zero (r =
—-0.121; P>0.20). But the first-order
partial correlation between wife’s age at
marriage and childbearing span was
highly significant (r= —0.592;
P<0.001).

Examination of eighteenth-century
English parish registers suggests that in
a rather high proportion of marriages
the bride was pregnant at the time of
marriage. Given the variability in human gestation and the variation in timing of baptisms, it was not possible to determine every case of premarital
pregnancy. There was, however, no evidence that baptisms were regularly delayed so as to cover up a premarital
pregnancy, as has also been noted for
other English parish records (e.g., Jackson and Laxton, 1977). As a conservative estimate, I counted as a probably
premarital pregnancy any case in which
the baptism of the first child occurred
less than eight calendar months after the
date of the marriage. Of 112 marriages

113

involving farmers, 53 (47.3%) involved
premarital pregnancies by this criterion.
Of 70 marriages involving craftsmen,
only 16 (22.9%) involved premarital
pregnancies. This difference in proportion is highly significant (7 = 10.95;
P<0.001).

DISCUSSION

The results support the hypothesis
that farmer couples tended to have
greater reproductive success than craftsman couples. This difference is apparently not so much due to a difference between the two occupational classes in
number of children born as to a difference between the classes in proportion
of children surviving. The data showed
that occupational class was significantly
correlated with both number of children
surviving to age 21 and proportion of
children surviving to age 21, independent of the number of children born to a
family.

On the assumption that a farm holding represented a resource enhancing
reproductive success, the data provide
evidence of a difference in reproductive
success capable of providing selection
for any genetically based behavioral or
other traits associated with the ability to
obtain or hold such a resource. The existence of such traits of course remains
speculative. The observed difference
between occupational classes in mean
reproductive success is quite marked,
given that it is detectable in a relatively
small sample and in a population apparently growing rapidly.

Many studies have found an inverse
correlation between fertility and social
class in industrialized countries (e.g.,
Wrong, 1958). Given low prereproductive mortality, fertility is a fairly accurate measure of reproductive success.

Thus, occupations which are considered
to have high status in these societies do
not always confer increased individual
fitness. Mitchell and Pratto (1977) note
that high-status occupations in the contemporary United States involve a “career life style” that deemphasizes the
value of a family. The result is reduced
individual fitness. It is possible that such
a reduction in individual fitness is compensated by an increase in inclusive
fitness (Hamilton, 1964), if high-status
individuals with low personal reproductive success use their accumulated
wealth to enhance the reproductive success of relatives (either during life or
through bequests).

As noted by Arnold et al. (1976), the
population literature tends to emphasize economic factors in explaining differences in family size. It is said that
families tend to be large when children
contribute economically and small when
children are economically dependent on
their parents. In rural societies, children
do contribute economically, and Arnold
et al. (1976) provide evidence that in rural societies expected economic help is
mentioned as a value of children. Sociobiological theory views the maximization of inclusive fitness as the ultimate
function (in an evolutionary sense) of all
reproductive behavior of humans and
other animals (e.g., Alexander, 1979).
Such a function is not inconsistent with
valuation of children for economic help
or other reasons reviewed by Arnold et
al. (1976). When children contribute economically, they lower the costs of raising other children and permit greater re

productive success on the part of the
parents. When children do not contribute economically, parents may maximize their reproductive success by concentrating their efforts on a smaller
family. Likewise, when resources are in
limited supply, parents may do better to
raise a small family.

In eighteenth-century Lancashire,
children were probably of some economic value to both farmers and craftsmen. In spite of poorer average survival
of children of craftsmen, there was no
clear evidence that craftsmen limited
births. However, there was some evidence that farmers had a less circumspect attitude toward reproduction than
did craftsmen. For instance, the proportion of pregnant brides among farmers
was twice as high as among craftsmen.
Interestingly, studies with modern US.

populations have found that marriages

of pregnant women are more common
when the groom is of low occupational
status (Sear, 1973), paralleling the inverse relationship between occupational
class and fertility in industrial societies.
Also, the mean age difference between
groom and bride was significantly higher
for farmers than for craftsmen, suggesting that even farmers who married relatively late in life sought young brides. A
young bride would have a longer childbearing span and thus, potentially, more
offspring.
