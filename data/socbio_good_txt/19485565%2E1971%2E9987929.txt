Dynamics of the Muslim-Hindu
Differential in Family Planning
Practices in Rural East

This study reports a portion of the results of research on religious affiliation and
family planning conducted under the auspices of the Pakistan Academy for Rural
Development in Comilla-Kotwali thanat
East Pakistan in 1968. The Academy conducts rural development programs—family planning, agricultural extension, rural
public works, youth education, formation
of cooperative societies, and female education and home development—on an experimental basis for possible adoption at
the national level. As early as 1961, the
Academy initiated a pilot family-planning
program referred to as the “organizer approach’? in four villages of the thana and
by 1964 the number rose to 22. In the

1The thana is an administrative unit of approximately one hundred square miles.

2The “organizer approach” utilized village
women (organizers) who were nominated by
their local cooperative society for training and
instruction in family planning at the Academy.
Upon completion of training, they conducted the
following activities in their villages: visits with
the village women to discuss and explain all
facets of family planning, the sale of contraceptive supplies (condoms and foam tablets), and
the keeping of systematic records on women who
purchased contraceptives.

 

 

latter part of 1964, a new program was
implemented that covered all 247 villages
of the thana and utilized commercial distribution channels for sale of contraceptives. In November of the same year an
IUCD clinic was established.

Research studies have been conducted
by the Academy to evaluate these familyplanning programs. This research includes
studies on family-planning practices and
the social and demographic characteristics
of persons who practice it. This information has been used to depict the social and
demographic differentials in family planning and to make inferences concerning
future trends in fertility planning. One of
the differentials which has been found consistently is between Muslims and Hindus,
that is, Hindus have been found to have
higher proportions who practice family
planning than Muslims (Khan and Choldin, 1965; Stoeckel, 1968; Stoeckel and
Choudhury, 1969@; Stoeckel and Choudhury, 19695). The present study will investigate further this religious differential
and will attempt to identify the factors
which may account for the relationship

between religious affiliation and practice
of family planning,

Although the religious differential may
be the result of ideological differences,
there is apparently no difference in the
religious doctrines concerning family planning (Kirk, 1969; Fagley, 1965). Since
the differential may not be attributed to
differences in the Hindu and Muslim ideologies, then other factors must be considered as a possible explanation. Such social
and demographic factors as socioeconomic
status (husband’s occupation, education,
and landholding), women’s age, age at
marriage, education, total living children,
and cooperative membership must be considered as possible reasons for the religious
differentials and will be controlled when
testing the relationship between religious
affiliation and practice of family planning.’
If one religious group has a higher proportional representation of one of these
variables and the variable is related to
practice, then the interpretation that religion is the explanatory variable would be
spurious. If the differential is still present
even while controlling on the above social
and demographic factors, this may lend

3 All of the social and demographic factors
controlled upon have been found to be related
to practice of family planning in Comilla. See

for example, Stoeckel, 1968, and Stoeckel and
Choudhury, 1969a.

support to the notion that the Muslim’s
practice of purdah* may have some effect
on the Muslim-Hindu differential. The
fact that the Hindu woman moves more
freely in society at large than does her
Muslim counterpart may result in a
greater exposure to changes being brought
about through the development programs
(family planning) and thus, she may have
a greater opportunity to be affected by
these changes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data were collected through the use
of a simple two-stage sample design. In
the first stage, 20 villages were selected
from a total of 247 in Comilla-Kotwali
thana on the basis of probability proportional to size. The second stage consisted
of listing all currently married females in
each village and then randomly selecting
80 women from each. The 1,600 currently
married women were then interviewed by
10 female interviewers from January to
March 1968. Female interviewers were
used because in pretesting it was found
that as a result of the purdah system
which requires the seclusion of women, it
was virtually impossible for males to interview females.

4Purdah is the system in Islam which requires
the seclusion of women.

* Fifteen respondents classified in the “Other” occupational category were omitted from the analysis.
{ Nine respondents classified in Maktob, religious education, were omitted from the analysis.

Practice of family planning was obtained by two questions to identify those
women currently using contraception and
those women who had ever used contraception. The questions used to obtain these
data were: “Have you or your husband
ever used any methods of family planning?” and “Are you or your husband now
using any methods?”.

RESULTS

As expected, Hindus have a significantly
higher proportion practicing family planning than Muslims (see Table 1). Three
times as many Hindus have ever practiced
family planning, while over four times as
many Hindus as Muslims are currently
practicing some method of contraception.

The results of testing the relationship
between religious affiliation and practice

of family planning while holding constant
husband’s socioeconomic status are shown
in Table 2. When controlling husband’s
occupation, those Hindu women whose
husbands are “farmers” have significantly
greater proportions than Muslims who
have ever practiced family planning. In
the occupational categories “Farming” and
“Business and skilled” there is also a significant difference between Hindu and
Muslim women who are currently practicing some method of contraception. However, for those women whose husbands are
“Business and skilled” the Hindus and
Muslims who have ever practiced family
planning do not differ significantly. These
findings may have resulted from the fact
that Muslim women whose husbands are
in the “Business and skilled” occupations
tried some method of contraception when

272,

the program was first started but have
stopped using it. A number of factors may
have accounted for their termination. For
example, it has been found that high proportions of Muslims terminate contraceptive use because of pressures from religious
Jeaders (Mulas) in the villages. Even
though Muslims in this high occupational
status (where adoption of family planning
would occur first) initially adopted at a
rate no different from that of the Hindus,
pressures may have been brought to bear
on them to quit practicing.

In the lowest occupational status, “Unskilled,” there are no significant differences
between Muslims and Hindus in the proportion who have ever practiced or who
are currently practicing family planning.
A possible explanation of these findings
may be that Muslim women in this low
occupational status are not able to observe
the seclusion of purdah because they are
needed to work in the fields (Kirk, 1969;
Wilber, 1964). They are more likely to
come in contact with the development programs and their personnel and this may
allow them to find out more about family
planning than would be expected if they
observed purdah strictly. By not being
completely secluded, the Muslim women
whose husbands are employed in “Unskilled” occupations may have as great a
chance of being exposed to family planning
programs as their Hindu counterpart. Because of this increased exposure, these
Muslim women may be as likely to adopt
some method of contraception as the Hindu women.

When husband’s education is used as a
control, the expected differences between
religious affiliation and practice of family
planning occur only in the two lowest educational groups (“No education” and
“Class 1-3”). Significantly more Hindus
than Muslims have ever practiced and are
currently practicing some method of con

traception. This, however, is not the case
for the more educated Muslims and Hindus (“Class 4-6” and “Class 7 and above”).
For these two educational groups, there
are no significant differences in practice of
family planning. Hence, higher educational
attainment dissolves the religious differences in the practice of family planning.

The results of controlling the relationship between religious affiliation and practice of family planning by landholding are
also shown in Table 2. In the two groups
which own land, significantly lower proportions of Muslims than Hindus have
ever practiced and are currently practicing
family planning. However, in the lowest
group, “No Jand,” the differences between
Muslims and Hindus are not significant.
Perhaps the economic hardships produced
by having no land transcends the importance of religious values in influencing the
family-planning practices of both religious
groups.

As seen in Table 3, the expected relationship between religious affiliation and
practice of family planning is not maintained throughout the age structure. In the
two oldest age groups, “30-39” and “4049,” Hindus have significantly greater proportions than Muslims who have ever
practiced and are currently practicing family planning. In the younger age groups,
“10-19” and “20-29,” no significant differences are found between religious affiliation and practice of family planning.

One explanation for these findings may
be that the religions differ in their norms
concerning family size. Additional data
from the present sample indicate that
Hindus had less traditional norms about
family size than Muslims (Mosena, 1970),
that is, they desired smaller families than
Muslims, However, until the desired number of children is reached, the Hindus will
probably not practice family planning in
any greater proportions than will the Mus

lims. Since desired family size is generally trolling age at marriage in the relationship
not reached before 30 years of age, this between religious affiliation and practice of
may account for the lack of significant family planning. For those women who
differences in practice of contraception be- are married below the age of 15 almost
tween the religions in the age group “10- three times as many Hindus as Muslims
19” and “20-29.” have ever practiced family planning while

rently practicing some method of contraception. However, for those women married after they were 15 years of age, there
are no significant differences between the
religious groups in their practice of family
planning.

In a society such as East Pakistan where
prepubertal marriage is orthodox, the postponement of marriage represents a break
with traditional norms. Thus, it would
appear that those who delay marriage irrespective of their religious affiliation have
similar family-planning practices.

As seen in Table 4, the relationship between religious affiliation and practice of
family planning does not hold when
woman’s education is controlled. Hindu
women with no education have significantly greater proportions who have ever
practiced and are currently practicing
family planning than do Muslim women
with no education. However, there are no
significant differences between Muslim and
Hindu women who have had some education.

This latter result is consistent with the
findings when husband’s education was
controlled. That is, Muslims and Hindus
with higher education simply do not differ
in their family-planning practices.

When the number of living children is
used as the control variable, there is no
consistent relationship between religious
affiliation and practice of family planning
(see Table 4). Hindu women who have
four or more living children have significantly greater proportions who are practicing or have ever practiced family planning than do Muslim women with similar
numbers of children. This relationship,
however, does not appear when the women
have fewer than four children, although
there is a significant difference between
Hindus and Muslims with “1-3 living
children” who have ever practiced family
planning.

Social Biology

These findings may have resulted from
the fact that Hindu women desired smaller
family sizes than do Muslim women (Mosena, 1970). Thus, more Hindu women
will probably have attained their desired
number by the third or fourth child and
will, therefore, have greater proportions
who practice family planning. Since Hindu
women are more receptive to family planning, they may be more likely to begin
using contraception even before they have
attained their desired number of children
in order to space them. Thus, the proportions of Hindus with “1-3 children” who
are currently practicing family planning
may not be significantly different from
their Muslim counterparts even though
there is a significant difference between
religious groups in those who have ever
practiced family planning.

Those women who have had no children
represent an extreme group for each religion since both religions stress that women
must have some children. These childless
women in both religions probably do not
even consider family planning because of
their desire to have at least some children.
Thus, the differential practice of family
planning is not likely to appear until after
several children are born.

Almost five times as many of the Hindus as Muslim women whose husbands
are not cooperative members have ever
practiced family planning and six times
as many are currently practicing some
method of contraception (see Table 4).
When the husbands are members of a cooperative, there are no significant differences between the two religions in their
practice of family planning.

An explanation of these findings may
be that in the early stages of the familyplanning programs in Comilla, the female
organizers were nominated by the local
cooperative societies. The recruitment of
male agents was also done through the

Hindu women whose husbands were cooperative members were more likely to be
exposed to the family-planning programs.
By being more exposed, the Muslim women
were probably as likely as the Hindu
women to break with tradition regarding
family limitation and to practice family
planning.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

An investigation into the dynamics of
the Muslim-Hindu differential in practice
of family planning has been conducted by
controlling upon the social and demographic factors that must be considered
as possible reasons for the differential.
The findings indicate that when the control variables are applied, the MuslimHindu differential is inconsistent and often
insignificant. The following conclusions
can be drawn from these findings.

First, whenever the religious differential in practice of family planning is found,
social and demographic controls must be
considered since the apparent relationship
between religious affiliation and practice
of family planning may be spurious.

Second, the dynamics of the religious
differential and practice of family planning are clearly demonstrated by looking
at the instances where the differential disappears. The relationship does not hold

in the cases where the women are most
affected by traditional norms or modern
orientations. In these two extreme categories the Muslim and Hindu women are
in some way equalized in their practice of
family planning. Those childless Muslim
and Hindu women under the traditional
pressure to have at least some children do
not differ in their practice of family planning because none of these women will
probably practice any method of contraception until they have had at least some
children. On the other extreme, when both
Muslim and Hindu women delay marriage, go to school, or have husbands with
higher education and who are cooperative
members, they are displaying more modernized characteristics and also do not
differ significantly in their practice of
family planning.

Thus, if practice has an effect on fertility (assuming the use-effectiveness of
contraceptives to be the same for both
religions) the Muslim-Hindu fertility differential which has been found in numerous studies in Pakistan and India may be
expected to diminish as the country develops and becomes more modernized. This
is not to imply, however, that the fertility
differential will disappear. Widow remarriage which is allowed by the Muslims and
forbidden by the Hindus should continue
to result in higher fertility for Muslims
in the older segments of the age structure.
