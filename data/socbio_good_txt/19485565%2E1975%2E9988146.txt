The Differential Evaluation of “Large’’ and
“Small” Families in Rural Colombia:
Implications for Family Planning

It is generally agreed among students of
social change that a major obstacle inhibiting social and economic improvement in
the less developed nations of the world is
the persistence of high fertility (Micklin,
1973; Revelle, 1971). Also clearly recognized is the importance of fertility norms
and ideals for explaining variations in reproductive performance and family size
(Davis and Blake, 1957; Freedman, 1963;
Davis, 1967; Bogue, 1969, pp. 839-841).
Nevertheless, conceptual, theoretical, and
methodological problems still inhibit understanding of the mechanisms through
which these norms and ideals are translated
into actual family building activities
(Hauser, 1967; Namboodiri, 1967; Hawthorn, 1968; Yaukey, 1969; Simmons,
1971, 1974; George, 1973). One such idea
that has received relatively little attention
is that of the quantitative and qualitative
dimensions of the limits and range of normatively evaluated reproductive performance, their relationship to processes of
sociodemographic change, and their effect
on family-size preference. In this article

* At the time this study was conducted, the authors were, respectively, Associate Professor and
Instructor of Sociology, Tulane University, New
Orleans, La.

these concerns are explored using interview
data collected in a rural Colombian community.

With few exceptions (Blake, 1966, 1967;
De Jong, 1968, p. 75-82; Rainwater, 1965,
pp. 118-138) prior studies of family-size
norms have focused on mean or median
values rather than on proportional distributions over the range of reported preferences.
Furthermore, even those investigators who
have examined the empirical distribution
of these ideals have grouped their observations into a few categories, the net result
being that upper and lower limits are not
identified, let alone systematically explored.
Within any population there exist extreme
values of family-size preferences that reflect the socially acceptable range of reproductive performance. For example,
conceptions of families that are “large,”
“small,” “too large,” and “too small” can
be translated into quantitative estimates of
this normatively acceptable range (Westoff
and Potvin, 1967, pp. 135-139). Persons
exceeding these limits, in either direction,
should be subject to social sanction. These
sanctions sometimes serve to keep fertility
generally within the culturally acceptable
range (cf. Reichel-Dolmatoff, 1971, pp.

44

Vol. 22, No. 1 “Large” and “Small”
144-145, and Wagley, 1951). It should be
evident that the greater the difference between upper and lower “ideal” limits within
a population, the greater will be the variation in reproductive performance and attempts to control that performance.
Moreover, the higher the upper limit, the
greater the probability of high fertility.
Significantly, these limits vary almost independently of the central tendency measures
of family-size norms.

Analysis of the normative boundaries of
acceptable family size may be carried further by considering their qualitative dimensions, For example, whatever the
numerical value attached to the concept
“large family,” members of a population
may evaluate it with positive or negative
affect, or perhaps with indifference. And,
whatever the evaluation expressed, it is
important to know its existential basis. In
other words, what is there about a “large
family” that evokes a particular evaluation?
Relatively few investigators have gone beyond the quantitative analysis of fertility
ideals to assess these qualitative factors
(but see Stycos, 1955; Rainwater, 1965;
Simmons, 1971, 1974; and Hoffman and
Hoffman, 1973). Additional questions
emerge as one seeks to explain differences
in these quantitative and qualitative dimensions of extreme family-size norms:
How are they distributed among the various
social groups and categories of a population? How are they influenced by processes
of sociodemographic change? A number of
studies have indicated that average familysize norms are, like levels of reproductive
performance, lower among the “modernized” sectors of populations (Freedman,
1963; Mauldin, 1965), and one might expect extreme values to exhibit this same
pattern. One heretofore unexplored aspect
of the demographic transition is the question of whether there is a constriction of
the socially acceptable range of family-size

Families in Colombia 45

preferences and/or a change of the existential bases for evaluating families of different sizes.

The issues outlined above should have
direct bearing on fertility control programs.
On the one hand, relevant data could be of
utility for determining the potential market
for family planning services and, on the
other hand, they could provide a basis for
structuring educational propaganda and
presenting incentives for fertility limitation.
Before it can be argued that “large” or
“small” families are becoming more prevalent or that they are subjectively desirable,
knowledge must be available as to how
people define these categories and of the
criteria by which they are evaluated. The
study reported here is a step in this direction.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

All data analyzed in this paper were obtained from female residents of a rural
town in the department of El Valle, Colombia. The town, a county seat with a population of about 2,500, is located on the
edge of the fertile Cauca River Valley.
Although almost all residents work either
there or in the surrounding farm area, bus
and auto travel to nearby cities is regular
and easy. Most of the children living in
the town were born there, but this is true
for only about half the adults. A considerable turnover in population was experienced
during the Violencia of the 1950’s, although
no great change in population size has occurred during the past thirty years, suggesting a continuing flow of out-migrants.

As part of a larger study dealing with
natality-related health care, 91 recently
delivered and currently pregnant women
were interviewed during the summer of
1970. This represents almost all such
women who were then residing in the community. Interviews were conducted in
Spanish, in the homes of the respondents,
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

46 Micklin and Marnane

by a specially trained team of university
students.

Respondents range rather evenly over
the age groups 17-24, 25-31, and 32-48.
Characteristically, they are rural in origin
(87 per cent gréw up in rural places) and
were married at a young age (two-thirds
before age 20). They typically have not
completed primary school (78 per cent)
and have husbands who are only slightly
better educated. Forty-seven per cent are
living in consensual union while 53 per
cent are legally married. Median family income is somewhat below 500 pesos per
month (U.S. $27.00). Four women are
currently pregnant for the first time, 25
have had two or three pregnancies, 28 have
experienced four to six pregnancies, and 34
have been pregnant seven or more times.
These figures include all cases of fetal
wastage as well as live births.

While there are obvious difficulties involved in attempting to generalize to a
larger population from data obtained from
this rather special group of respondents, it
is probable that the range and variations
observed are at least suggestive of those
that might be found among other nonisolated rural women in Colombia. Although not directly comparable in all
respects, a recently reported study (Simmons, 1974) provides some relevant data
for a sample of 1,712 Colombian women.
It will thus be possible to contrast our results with those from this more ambitious
investigation and thus to determine the extent of agreement between the two.

Family-size boundaries are measured in
terms of four questions designed to elicit
quantitative estimates of “large” and
“small” families. Each woman was asked
to give the number of children she thought
to constitute “a large family” and “a small
family” and, in addition, the number of
children felt to be “too many” and “too
few.” Interviewers were explicitly instructed

Social Biology

not to assist respondents in arriving at a
particular number, although when the answer was “all God sends” or “all that
come” the interviewer followed with the
probe, “How many would that be?” Most
women had relatively little trouble in providing discrete numbers for these estimates.

Beyond determining the quantitative
range of normative evaluations regarding
family size, this research was designed to
elicit respondents’ subjective evaluations of
“large” and “small” families. Thus, one
question was phrased, “Some people think
a large family brings many problems;
others think it is a blessing. What do you
think? A second question stated, “Some
people think that a small family is a good
idea; others don’t. What do you think?”
In addition, each respondent was asked,
“Why is it good (bad) to have a large
(small) family,” thus providing an opportunity to indicate both positive and negative factors associated with having a family
at each size extreme.t For each of these
questions the interviewer recorded the
respondent’s verbatim reply.

A third set of questions dealt with family
1 One reader of this paper commented that these
two questions differ in that “brings problems”
versus “is a blessing” is not a mutually exclusive
pair of responses, while “is a good idea” versus
“ig not a good idea” ts mutually exclusive.
Whether or not such a difference would influence
response patterns is a reasonable question, but
one the authors cannot answer. However, we are
not at all convinced that the first pair of responses is any less exclusive than the second.
From a practical point of view, a condition that
“brings problems” will not generally be viewed,
at the same time, as a “blessing,” and vice versa.

Moreover, there was a rationale underlying the
differential wording of these two questions. We
were trying to minimize the likelihood that a respondent’s evaluation of “large family” would
dictate her evaluation of “small family.” We felt
that if the two questions were worded exactly
alike, e.g., “a good idea” versus “not a good idea,”
conflicting or ambiguous evaluations of these two
family-size types would be unlikely to show up.
In other words, the first response could potentially provide a cue to the second, assuming the
respondent wished to appear consistent. We believe our decision to word the two questions differently reduced this possibility.

size preferences. Three are considered in
this paper. First, the women were asked,
“If you were to start your family all over
again today, how many children would you
have?” A second question was, “What do
you think is the ideal number of children
for a family in the same economic conditions as your present one?” Finally, respondents were asked, “If you were advising
one of your own children about his own
family, how many children would you like
him/her to have?” Once again, interviewers
were requested to allow respondents to answer freely without any assistance.

Two brief scales designed to measure
traditional-modern value orientations, “integration with relatives” and “preference
for urban life,” are employed (Kahl, 1968,
pp. 18-44). Three other variables are
utilized as indicators of traditionalismmodernism as well. These include husband’s education, respondent’s education,
and marital status, i.e., whether legally
married or living in consensual union. It
is assumed that higher education indicates
greater modernity (Fawcett and Bornstein, 1973, p. 125) and that legal marriage
is more “modern” than consensual union
in the cultural context in which observations were made.

RESULTS

FAMILY SIZE BOUNDARIES AND THEIR
EVALUATION

Consider first the upper and lower boundaries used to circumscribe family-size
norms. These boundaries are the mean number of children perceived by respondents
to constitute a “large” family, a family
with “too many” children, a “small” family,
and a family with “too few” children. Table 1 presents these data according to a
variety of respondent background characteristics. Results indicate, first, that the
mean values for “large” families are con
 

Families in Colombia 47
sistently greater than those for families
with “too many” children, while “small”
families are viewed as larger than those
with “too few” children. Furthermore, older
respondents indicate higher norms with regard to “small” families as well as those
with “too many” children, and the mean
values shown are smallest for women with
lower parity (although it should be remembered that the majority have probably
not completed their childbearing). Higher
family income appears to be associated with
lower values attributed to families with
“too many” and “too few” children. Finally, respondents exhibiting greater traditionalism generally indicate higher values
for all four categories of norms (Table 2).

Further variation is seen when respondents’ patterns of evaluation for “large”
and “small” families are examined. These
women are almost equally divided regarding
positive and negative evaluations of “large”
families, with approximately 46 per cent
saying that a “large” family is a blessing
while 50 per cent feel that it brings problems. A striking contrast is seen, however,
when one considers evaluations of “small”
families. Roughly three-quarters of these
respondents think small families are a good
idea while only 15 per cent think they are
not. Quite clearly then, according to these
aggregate measures, the women surveyed

do not hold fixed and consistent ideas re- 
garding the evaluation of “large” and
“small” families. Background characteristics have little influence on evaluations of
“Jarge” families, but a number of differences are related to indicators of traditionalism (Table 3). Traditional respondents
are more likely to see “large” families as
a blessing, while those who exhibit modern
characteristics more often think that
“small” families are a good idea.

The reason respondents give for evaluating “large” and “small” families as good
and bad are of interest here (tables avail

able from the authors). In many respects,
the accounts provided by these women are
similar to what Rainwater (1965, pp. 139158) calls “rationales for family size.”
With respect to the desirability of “large”
and “small” families, health-related factors
are relatively unimportant. Nearly a third
of the respondents for whom data are available (NV = 82) feel that provision for the
welfare of children is more problematic in
larger families, e.g., children receive inadequate care and guidance at home and too
little formal education in “large” families.
Economic factors such as inadequate resources for family support and inability to
acquire savings are cited by about 45 per
cent of the women as arguments against
“large” families, Family-related factors are
seen as positive attributes of “large” families with about 81 per cent of the respondents expressing a general liking for
children or beliefs that family harmony is
increased, that children may provide companionship and help for their parents, or
that they may add to the prestige of the
family name. It should be noted that only
19 per cent of these women feel that there
is nothing good about “large” families and
24 per cent feel that there is nothing bad
about them. In any case, it is clear that the
great majority of women do weigh the relative merits of having “large” families
though the evaluations are not greatly imbalanced.

With respect to the rationales given in
evaluating “small” families, the general
pattern of response shows that health factors are again seldom considered. Welfare
of children and economic factors are seen
overwhelmingly as positive attributes of
the “small” family. The former category
includes advantages in providing child care,
education,: and other socialization activities for children. Such considerations account for about 62 per cent of the positively
perceived attributes of “small” families.

Families in Colombia 51
Economic advantages are cited only about
half as frequently and consist of statements
to the effect that family income will go
further, savings are possible, inheritance
is less problematic, and that the family’s
general economic welfare is better than
would be the case with a “large” family.
Family-related rationales are given as both
positive and negative aspects of the “small”
family, but the ratio is about four to one
in favor of the latter. Positive aspects refer
primarily to greater harmony and happiness, while negative factors suggest less
harmony and happiness, lower family prestige, and greater loneliness for the parents.
While only two respondents indicate that
there is nothing good about “small” families, slightly more than four-fifths say that
there is nothing bad about them. Clearly,
in contrast to the balanced feelings these
women apparently have toward “large”
families, their evaluation of “small” families is overwhelmingly positive.

FAMILY-SIZE PREFERENCES
The data presented thus far suggest relatively flexible views regarding the acceptable range of reproductive behavior. Furthermore, as a group, these women appear
to be somewhat ambivalent about the desirability of “large” families and generally
in favor of “small” families even though
they are rather consistent in their recognition of positive and negative aspects of
these quite distinct (by their own definitions) family types. An interesting question
may be raised as to where personal preferences fit in relation to these uncrystallized
and sometimes inconsistent views regarding
extreme values of family-size norms (cf.
George, 1973, p. 363). Do they tend toward
the “large” or “small” end of the continuum? Are values for family-size preferences
affected by background characteristics and
traditionalism in the same manner as are

Several measures of family-size preferences are presented in Tables 4 and 5. Considering overall variations, it is evident
that the ideal number of children respondents would advise their own children to
have is consistently lower than their “‘subjective ideal” (i.e., the number of children
the respondent would have if she could start
over again) which is, in turn, consistently
lower than the “objective ideal” (i.e., the
number of children the respondent would
suggest for a family in similar economic
circumstances).

ideals and a smaller family advised for
their children. An increasing number of
pregnancies is related to higher objective
ideals. Women in higher income families
show lower subjective and objective ideals
as well as preferences for fewer children for
their own offspring. Finally, the number of
children in the respondent’s family of orientation is inversely related to subjective
ideals and directly related to objective
ideals and to ideals for their children.

siderably higher objective ideals, Further
variations are evident according to value
orientations, with those respondents who
indicate higher preference for urban life
showing lower objective ideals and lower
ideals for their children. Women scoring
lower on integration with relatives have
slightly higher objective ideals and higher
ideals for their children.

It is evident that these respondents’
family-size preferences approximate much
more closely their concept of “small” than
of “large” families. In fact, though their
mean objective ideal exceeds by about half
a child the norm for a “small” family, their
mean subjective ideal is about two-tenths
of a child less than this number, and the
mean ideal they would advise for their
children is fully half a child less. In no
case, however, are these preferences less
than the lower limit defined as “too few.”
It is also apparent that background factors and measures of traditionalism are

frequently, though not always consistently,
related to these norms.

EVALUATIONS, BOUNDARIES, AND PREFERENCES

Earlier in this discussion it was demonstrated that respondents varied somewhat
in their evaluation of “large” and “small”
families, It is reasonable to ask whether
these global judgments regarding extremes
in family-size norms exert an influence on
the associated numerical values as well as
the intermediate family-size preferences
(cf. Simmons, 1971). Evidence regarding
this question is presented in Tables 6 and
7. Overall evaluations of “large” and
“small” families affect the numerical limits attributed to each only with respect to
these extremes (Table 6). It is apparent
that mean values for both indicators of
“small” families are quite close regardless
of overall evaluations of either “large” or
“small” families. On the other hand, the

‘constitutes “too many” is obtained from

respondents who say “large” families
“bring problems,” while the highest values
are evident for those women who say
“large” families are “a blessing” and
“small” families are “a bad thing.” Similarly, the highest mean value attributed to
“large” families is given by respondents
who say “small” families are “a bad thing,”
although, perhaps unexpectedly, the lowest
value for “large” families is indicated by
those women who say “large” families are
“a blessing.” Once again, greater inconsistencies are encountered with respect to
ideas regarding the upper limits of familysize norms.

In Table 7 the influence of family-size
evaluations on family-size preferences is
considered. Not only do overall evaluations
make a difference, but these differences are
consistently as expected. That is to say,
those women who negatively evaluate
“small” families have the highest mean
values on all three preference measures.
The next highest values observed appear in
the case of those respondents who feel that

“large” families are “a blessing.” Values
for those who feel “large” families are
problematic and that “small” families are
“a good thing” are smallest, and differences
between the two are minimal. Thus, it is
evident that with respect to family-size
preferences, respondents’ orientations toward “large” and “small” families, especially the latter, are highly consequential
for their personal ideals and the counsel
they would provide their children as well.

DISCUSSION

In this section we discuss our overall
findings and, where possible, contrast them
with the Colombian data presented by
Simmons (1974). A clear pattern emerges
from data reflecting the rank order of mean
values of family-type categories. The number of children in a “large” family is highest, followed by number of children
considered “too many,” number of children
in a “small” family, and number of children
considered “too few,” in that order. It is
encouraging to observe that our respon

dents’ mean values for a “large” family
(10.4) and a “small” family (3.2) are
precisely the same figures reported by Simmons (1974, p. 131, Table 3). Furthermore, subjective ideals for family size
approximate very closely what respondents consider to be “small”? families and
are, of course, more than “too few,” considerably fewer than “too many,” and even
more dramatically fewer than what respondents consider “large” families. Again,
Simmons’ results are generally in agreement, although his single measure of family-size preference, the “best number of
children for a woman to have,” averages
a child and a half higher than the “objective ideal” for our sample (5.2 vs. 3.7).
These results imply a positive evaluation
of socially defined “small” families among
these rural women and this indication is
indeed borne out by other evidence. While
slightly less than one-half of the respon
_ dents see “large” families as desirable,

they tend to think more consistently (75
per cent of the cases) that “small” families
are generally a good idea. The corresponding figures from Simmons’ data are 83 per
cent and 95 per cent, respectively (1974,

p. 132, Table 4). Obviously there is overlap
here indicating a degree of ambivalence,
but still a generally more positive evaluation
of smaller families persists. Given this ambivalence, and the consequent instability
of response to be expected, it is not surprising that our figures are at variance with
those reported by Simmons although the
general pattern remains clear. Examination of the reasons cited for considering
“large” and “small” families either desirable or undesirable indicates that rationales
supporting “large” families are primarily
family-related, including such factors as
family prestige and family harmony, On
the other hand, rationales related to the
well-being and education of children as well
as economic considerations militate against
larger families, i.e., are reasons for favoring “small” families. These findings are
again supported by Simmons’ (1974, p.
132) results.

In addition, with regard to the consideration of family-size ideals, in all cases the
high-to-low order of mean values runs from
the number desirable for others in the same
economic circumstances as the respondent
(objective ideal), followed by the subjecDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

tive ideal, with the ideal for one’s own
children having the lowest value. Whereas
definitional criteria, overall, show an inconclusive pattern, it is evident that mean
values for number of children that are “too
many” and number of children in a “small”
family are depressed in the cases where
“large” families are viewed negatively and
“small” families are viewed positively. In
accord with this pattern, it was determined
that the ideals themselves are lower for
those who view “large” families negatively
and ‘‘small” families positively in all measured instances. This finding clearly implies
that attitudes toward variable levels of
family size affect the quantitative criteria
by which they are defined as the projected
ideal reproductive behavior. Confirming
evidence is once again provided by Simmons
(1974, p. 136, Table 7).

With respect to traditional-modern value
orientations, definitional means are depressed among the more modern categories
of respondents in almost all instances.
Moreover, “modern” women are more likely
to view “large” families negatively and
“small” families positively than are their
more traditional counterparts. When considering links between bases for qualitative
evaluation of “large” families, the traditional-modern differences are somewhat
mixed, although there is a tendency for
more modern persons to mention welfare
of children and economic reasons more
frequently and family reasons less frequently. Analysis of judgments regarding
the advantages and disadvantages of
“small” families does not permit clear differentiation between traditional and moderm groups.

Regarding both subjective and objective
family-size ideals, it is apparent that more
modern women tend to exhibit lower mean
values than do traditional women, while the
pattern is mixed with respect to the number
of offspring they would advise for their

Social Biology

own children. It is interesting that examination of standard deviations indicates that
the more modern respondents, those with
lower family-size ideals, and those with
lower quantitative criteria for various
classes of families show less variation
about the mean. Furthermore, it can be
observed that ranges between categories of
family size and categories of ideals tend to
be more constricted for the moderns as
well. This suggests that modern persons
may better communicate their norms than
traditional persons, which is perhaps to be
expected where fatalistic acceptance of
norms and “the rightness of what is” are
associated with traditional orientations
toward patterns of social conduct.

Results regarding the positive and negative aspects of “large” and “small” families are in agreement with Stycos’ Puerto
Rican data (1955, pp. 158-181), as well as
the more extensive information presented
by Simmons (1974). While economic considerations in particular suggest the undesirability of “large” families, contradictory sentiments, focusing on contributions
children make to family cohesion and family security, work in the opposite direction.
The simultaneous existence of these conflicting evaluations probably works against
the crystallization of an effective universalistic smaller family norm. The ambiguity in evaluations, although weighted
in favor of “small” families, may well result from conflicting cultural influences. On
the one hand, there is the traditional norm
associated with rural life and Catholicism
that emphasizes the value of “large” families while, on the other hand, women are
influenced by a shared awareness of the
economic and family responsibility difficul- .
ties involved in raising numerous children.
These women are probably much like their
poor and lower-middle-class counterparts
in the United States who reflect the idea
that numerous children are desirable, but

Vol. 22, No. 1 “Large” and “Small”
one should not have more children than the
family can support (Rainwater, 1965, p.
150).

IMPLICATIONS

Stycos (1971, p. 8) has argued that
“there is little doubt that there is at least
a latent preference for a moderate size
family rather than a small one [in Latin
America].”” These rural Colombian women
show family-size preferences more closely
approximating “small” families as defined
by their own normative criteria. This suggests that, in a normative sense, “small”
families are considered desirable; but the
definition of “small,” from their point of
view, is still higher than demographers and
family planners would view as moderate
size.

An important implication of this finding
for fertility control programs is that planners who aim at bringing about a depression of fertility rates must emphasize the
value of families of a specific size rather
than of the “small” family as a generalized
concept. If parents and potential parents in
their observations and conversations with
others determine that the implicit norm for
“small” families is three or four or five
children, then the motivation for limiting
family size early in their reproductive life
cycle is not going to be great. And if families do not seriously consider the utilization of reliable contraceptive methods until
their reproductive performance far exceeds
replacement, the goal of family planning
programs, that is, reduction of population
growth, becomes largely irrelevant to their
means, If, in the face of increased longevity,
the ideals of family size are not quantitatively decreased, then the planning of
births by families can only lead to continued high rates of population growth.

It would appear from the data presented
here that women, as they become more
“modernized,” do tend to see greater

Families in Colombia 397
advantages in smaller families. Still, their
concept of what quantitatively defines a
“small” family is far greater than required
for replacement. Consequently, even if
the cultural norm favors “small” families
and family planning by couples is absolutely effective, the net result could be at
best a small decline in overall rates of
population growth. It is for such reasons
that Davis (1967) argues that family
planning programs as they currently exist
are largely ineffective in achieving the goals
of fertility control.

It has been demonstrated in numerous
KAP studies that there is a general desire
to limit family size in almost all areas of
the world, leading some optimists to conclude that norms have emerged which favor
the use of effective contraceptive techniques
in family planning (see Bogue, 1967). But
family planning programs aimed at providing the assurance that couples will have
“no more children than they want” or
even “small” families, as observed in the
present research, are hopelessly inadequate
to the task of reducing growth rates. Policy
must explicitly emphasize reducing quantitative norms to levels that are considerably lower than those which now obtain.
Vagueness in population policy, as in all
such statements, tends to subvert the goals
of planning.

SUMMARY

Quantitative and qualitative dimensions
of family-size norms have been examined
for a nearly complete enumeration of currently pregnant and recently delivered
women residing in a rural Colombian town
(VN = 91). Attention is focused on perceived numerical boundaries for families
that are “large,” “small,” “too large,” and
“too small” as well as on evaluations of
these normatively defined family units, and
on family-size preferences. Variations are
assessed in terms of selected respondent
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

background characteristics and measures
of traditional-modern value orientations.

Results indicate that quantitative norms
are highest for “large” families, followed
by the norms for families with “too many”
children, those that are “small,” and those
with “too few” children, respectively.
Smaller norms are indicated by younger
women who have had fewer pregnancies,
are of lower economic status, come from
larger families of orientation, and hold
more modern values.

While “large” families are equally evaluated as a blessing and as problematic,
“small” families are given positive evaluations by over three-quarters of the women
interviewed. The quality of interpersonal
relationships is seen as a positive aspect of
“large” families and a negative aspect of
“small” families, whereas economic and
child welfare factors are viewed as negative aspects of “large” families and positive
aspects of smaller ones.

Family-size preferences are lowest when
advice for respondents’ children is considered, higher when the possibility of beginning one’s own family again is contemplated,
and highest when considering economic circumstances, and preferences are generally
related to respondent characteristics in the
same direction as were norms for familysize boundaries. Furthermore, positive eval
 

Social Biology

uations of “large” families and negative
evaluations of “small” families are consistently associated with larger boundary
estimates and family-size preferences.

Discussion concentrates on the ambiguities evident in these estimates and evaluations of family-size norms and _ their
implications for family planning policy.
Many of the findings reported here are
highly consistent with comparable data
pertaining to a much larger sample of rural
Colombian women (Simmons, 1974), thus
providing independent confirmation for
these data.
