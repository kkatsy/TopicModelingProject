Retardation, and Fetal Loss

ABSTRACT: This study examines the magnitude and shape of the interpregnancy interval (IPI)
effect on three pregnancy outcomes: preterm low birthweight (PRETERM-LBW), intrauterine
growth-retardation low birthweight (IUGR-LBW), and fetal loss (LOSS). A multinomial logistic
regression model is estimated, based on data from the 1988 National Survey of Family Growth
which contains pregnancy histories. The results indicate that both short and long intervals raise
the risk of IUGR-LBW and LOSS, net of sociodemographic and behavioral variables, but IPI

effects on PRETERM-LBW are not clear.

The consistent finding that short
preceding birth intervals are associated
with increased risk of infant mortality
has generated several lines of research
which zero in on the components of the
overall relationship. One line of research empirically tests the hypothesis
that the overall relationship between
birth intervals and infant mortality may
be accounted for, in part, by short gestation (prematurity) of the “index”
birth. Miller (1989) quantified the extent to which gestational age confounds the birth interval effect on
perinatal mortality: controlling for gestational age significantly reduced the
birth interval effect on perinatal mortality primarily among the group (index pregnancies) with the shortest

birth intervals. One conclusion of that
research was that, although short prior
birth intervals exert direct effects on
perinatal mortality, gestational age
exerts indirect effects, most likely
through preterm birth (high risk of
perinatal mortality). Gribble (1991)

also examined whether gestational age
confounds birth interval effects on
pregnancy outcomes, but focused on
low birthweight (LBW) as the outcome. The analysis showed that short
birth intervals continue to raise the
probability of subsequent low birthweight after controlling for gestational
age of the index birth, suggesting, as in
Miller’s study, that birth intervals exert
both direct and indirect effects on adverse outcomes.

These demographic studies raise the
question of how pregnancy spacing, or
interpregnancy interval (time interval
from prior pregnancy’s outcome to
conception date of index pregnancy),
directly affects two forms of low birthweight which are largely defined by
gestational age: preterm birth (PRETERM) and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), the latter category
consisting mainly of term infants
that are low birthweight. Within the
context of research that is concerned
with the birth-interval—infant-mortality

association, PRETERM and IUGR
pregnancy outcomes are two causal
components within the overall association, and are strong predictors of subsequent infant mortality.

Few studies to date have looked at
how pregnancy spacing directly affects
these outcomes separately within one
study sample. A case-control study by
Ferraz et al. (1988), undertaken in
Brazil, found short interpregnancy intervals (IPI) to be associated with
IUGR, although when the mother’s
postpartum weight was controlled
(their proxy for prepregnancy weight),
the IPI effect became insignificant in
their analysis. IPI never displayed an
effect on PRETERM, however. Lieberman et al. (1989) examined the effect of IPI on IUGR. Their results indicated that very short IPI’s (less than
three months) were associated with the
highest risk of subsequent IUGR, although there were few effects of any
other interval length longer than the
0-3 months interval. Lang et al. (1990)
examined the IPI effect on PRETERM
and found no significant effects. Studies prior to the above have examined
the IPI effect on LBW overall (Eisner,
1979; Fortney and Higgins, 1984;
Spiers and Wang, 1976) or neonatal
mortality, with most showing adverse
effects of short IPI’s.

Late pregnancy loss or stillbirth was
a component of Miller’s dependent
variable, perinatal mortality, but fetal
loss (including spontaneous abortion)
is less often examined than is low birthweight or infant mortality in studies of
birth interval effects. The relationship
between IPI and subsequent fetal loss
raises additional complexities to be discussed, but previous studies usually

Kallan

Social Biology

find either a U-shaped or J-shaped association between IPI and LOSS (Casterline, 1989; Mostafa, 1991; Swensen
and Harper, 1978; Zimmer, 1979).

This study looks at the IPI effect on
these three outcomes separately —preterm low birthweight (PRETERMLBW), intrauterine growth-retardation low birthweight (IUGR-LBW),
and fetal loss (LOSS)—so that the effect of IPI and other independent variables can be compared across outcomes. These outcomes appear to
share similar sociodemographic risk
factors but may have different proximate determinants (Bragonier et al.,
1983; Institute of Medicine, 1985;
Kramer, 1987).

The data used in this study do not
include measures of proximate determinants (such as weight gain), and we
cannot look at possible factors such as
maternal depletion which may account
for the relationship between IPI and
adverse outcomes. The shape of the relationship can be described, however,
which sheds light on the broader link
between birth intervals and infant mortality that has often been observed.
The inclusion of confounding sociodemographic and (limited) behavioral
variables in a multivariate model will
clarify the effect of IPI. These variables are important in their own right
as demographic and behavioral risk
factors whose effects will be compared
across different pregnancy outcomes.

The interpregnancy interval is the
appropriate interval to use as an independent variable in models that predict
pregnancy outcomes (as in studies by
Ferraz, 1988; Lieberman, 1989; Spiers
and Wang, 1976). Earlier studies using
birth intervals to study interval effects

 

 
 

Vol. 39, No. 3-4

on infant mortality usually did not have
measures of interpregnancy intervals
(or gestation data).

The present study differs from most
other studies that examine interval effects (whether birth or interpregnancy
interval) in that it uses U.S. national
survey data rather than vital statistics
data or hospital data. Also, there has
been little research on this topic for the

=U. S. population. The Ferraz et al.
“study of PRETERM and IUGR is
Sbased on hospital data from a Brazilian
city. The Lieberman et al. study of
RIUGR and the Lang et al. study of
ooPRETERM are based on Boston hosSpital data. Gribble’s study of low birth+
caweight is one of the few analyses based
~on survey data (respondents were sam‘gpled from health centers in Mexico).
aMiller’s study of perinatal mortality is
Sbased on vital records data (compiled
aby W.H.O.) from Sweden and Hun‘Sgary. Spiers and Wang’s study of LBW
overall) as an intervening variable beStween IPI and SIDS is based on North
‘<Carolina vital statistics. Fortney and
Higgins’ study of perinatal mortality
Sand overall LBW is based on hospital
‘edata from Iran.
s The use of U.S. national survey data
‘Scontaining pregnancy histories has pootential pluses and minuses. The advantages over hospital data include greater
generalizability and greater variability
of demographic and socioeconomic
characteristics (advantages shared with
vital statistics data). The limitations include inferior data quality due to recall
error inherent in retrospective data,
the reliance on self-report rather than
medical diagnosis (for pregnancy outcome, conception date, and gestational
age), and small sample sizes. Overall,

Interpregnancy Intervals

the quality of the data in the present
study appears to be adequate, based on
comparisons with external datasets. I
address these issues in the following
section and at the conclusion of the paper when I consider how response error may affect the results.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data come from the National
Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), Cycle 4, collected in 1988. The NSFG is a
periodic survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, providing information on fertility, family
planning, and maternal and _ child
health. The survey is designed to represent the U.S. noninstitutional population of women aged 15-44. Cycle 4
interviewed 8,450 women, selected according to a 5-stage area probability
design with oversampling of blacks.
Personal interviews were conducted
between January and August of 1988
by female interviewers. A primary focus of the interview was the collection
of a pregnancy history which asks each
respondent about the outcome, date of
outcome, and gestation length in
weeks of each of her pregnancies. To
obtain the outcome data, respondents
were shown a flashcard with the
choices being: live birth, induced abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth, or ectopic
pregnancy. For a live birth, they were
asked the infant’s weight in pounds and
ounces. Not all respondents reported
exact weights, and these respondents
were then asked whether the child was
above or below 5.5 pounds.

The most recent pregnancy is the
unit of analysis in this study (the index
pregnancy). I use (index) pregnancies

that were completed within ten years
of the survey (pregnancies ending
between 1978 and 1987). In order to
analyze only completed index pregnancies, I eliminated pregnancies beginning less than ten months before the
survey. Index pregnancies were also
excluded if they had any of the following characteristics: (a) first pregnancies; (b) ended in induced abortion or
ectopic pregnancy (there are few ectopic pregnancies in the data); (c) multiple outcomes; (d) missing gestation
data. The study is limited to white and
black respondents, some of whom are
of hispanic origin. The final sample size
is 2,104 pregnancies. All analyses are
based on weighted data, to account for
the stratified sample design (individual
weight. divided by mean sample weight
was used).

In this study, a birth is defined as
PRETERM-LBW if it is less than 5
pounds 9 ounces (LBW) and with a
gestational age of less than 37 weeks.
IUGR-LBW is defined as less than 5
pounds 9 ounces (LBW) with a gestational age of 37 or more weeks. These
definitions are approximations of the
more common (clinical) definition of
PRETERM (less than 37 weeks) and
IUGR (below the tenth percentile of a
normed distribution of birthweight for
gestational age).

Fetal loss (LOSS) is defined as a
spontaneous loss at any time during
pregnancy: early and late losses are included (i.e., spontaneous abortions
and stillbirths), but ectopic pregnancies are excluded as mentioned before.

The analysis sample has a white

LBW rate of 4.1 (compared to 5.6 in .

1983 vital statistics) and a black rate of
13.7 (compared to 12.6 in 1983 vital
Statistics). (Vital statistics were ob
 

 

Social Biology

tained from U.S. Dept. of Health and
Human Services, 1988). Our data show
that 59 per cent of LBW births (combined races) are PRETERM rather
than IUGR, while vital statistics shows
56 per cent PRETERM-LBW (Taffel,
1989). The pregnancy outcome rates in
this study, then, are fairly close to what
1983 vital statistics data show (1983 being the midpoint of the retrospective
time interval used in this study), although somewhat lower for whites and
slightly higher for blacks. First pregnancies are excluded, however, and
the analysis sample is limited to the recent pregnancy.

The fetal loss rate in the study sample is 8 per cent, calculated from the
total number of losses divided by all
outcomes other than induced abortions. This fetal loss rate is lower than
most clinical studies based on prospective data with life-table estimates
which report a rate of between 13 and
15 per cent for recognized pregnancies
(Leridon, 1977). However, 10 per cent
of recognized pregnancies miscarried
in a recent clinical study (StagnaroGreen et al., 1990). Lindbohm and
Hemminki (1988) report a rate of 8.9
per cent based on the Finnish data base
of medically diagnosed spontaneous
abortion from hospital discharges and
polyclinic records. The NSFG data do
produce a fetal loss rate of approximately 13 per cent when the calculation is based on all pregnancies to all
women (which would include more
“repeat losses” in the calculation). Underreporting of losses, especially early
losses, is likely, however.

As another check on the data, the
distribution of months between live
births of parity two and higher, by
race, was compared to published vital

 

 
Vol. 39, No. 3-4

statistics data (National Center for
Health Statistics, 1989) (IPI distributions are not available, to my knowledge, in published tabulated form for
comparison). The distributions in my
NSFG sample were very similar to that
of vital statistics data.

VARIABLE DEFINITIONS AND
BIVARIATE ASSOCIATIONS

= Because the focus of the study is on
“the size and shape of the net effect of
SIP] across the three outcomes, a mulStivariate model (estimated by logistic
Aregression) is used to control for extraconeous variables, most of which are sostciodemographic. The final model incicludes the variables: interpregnancy
interval (IPI), race, education, age at
=pregnancy, pregnancy order, prior
emregnancy outcome, and smoking.
"Oo Table 1 presents bivariate relation2ships between the independent variSables and pregnancy outcome. IPI is
categorized into five groups to allow
ofor nonlinear relationships: 0-6
‘=months, 7-12, 13-24, 25-48, and 49 +
= months. This categorization is optimal
Spiven the sample size in the present
“estudy and allows comparisons with
Smost previous studies. The first two
categories each contain approximately
Sone eighth of the sample observations,
and the remaining three categories
each contain roughly one quarter of
the sample cases. In Table 1 there is
little association between IPI and
PRETERM-LBW, but there is a slight
U-shaped relationship between IPI and
both IUGR-LBW and LOSS. The relationship between IPI and rates of
normal pregnancy has an_ inverted
U-shape, suggesting in a more summarized way that short and long IPI’s are
associated with adverse outcomes as a

whole. However, a multivariate analysis is needed to analyze these relationships since IPI is associated with most
of the other independent variables.
Age at pregnancy outcome (AGE)
has the categories 15~24, 25-34, and
35+, which yields sufficient sample
sizes in each category, although an
ideal grouping might allow finer categories. Table 1 shows a generally
U-shaped bivariate association between age and each of the pregnancy
outcomes. Mean pregnancy order
(ORDER) is lowest for normal births
relative to the three other outcomes,
but there appears to be no relationship
between pregnancy order and the adverse Outcomes contrasted with each
other. Outcome of the prior pregnancy
has a strong bivariate association with
outcome of the current (index) pregnancy, as expected, although prior adverse outcomes of one type are also
predictors of another type. Blacks are
several times more likely to have a
PRETERM-LBW or IUGR-LBW outcome than whites, but fetal loss rates
do not vary by race in this sample.
Socioeconomic status is often associated with pregnancy outcome as well
as pregnancy spacing in prior studies,
and thus it is a necessary control in
the multivariate analysis. The indicator
of socioeconomic status in this study
is the woman’s education in years
(EDUC). It is measured at the time of
the survey, which in most cases is a
good proxy for their education at the
time of pregnancy. Income, however,
could not be used because it is not
available for time periods more than a
year before the interview. Table 1
shows that a higher level of education
is associated with a lower rate of
LBW, but this is not the case for fetal

loss (and the sign is in the opposite
direction).

Smoking (SMOKE) is a dichotomous variable based on the question:
“Did you smoke cigarettes at all during
the last twelve months before the
end of your last pregnancy?” Smoking
has a strong positive association with

the adverse pregnancy outcomes in
Table 1.

Other demographic and behavioral
variables were considered, such as utilization of prenatal care, marital status,
and alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Prenatal care measures were
not available for half of the cases in my

 

 
Vol. 39, No. 3-4

study sample (those data are not collected for pregnancies more than a
few years from the survey date). Marital status and alcohol consumption
(crudely measured) were tested but
dropped from the analysis because
neither improved the fit of the overall
model. As the forthcoming analysis
shows, the variables in Table 1 have
the same directions of relationship with
Spregnancy outcome when analyzed ina
multivariate model as they do on a biSvariate level.

MODEL SPECIFICATION

Multinomial logistic regression analcoysis is used for model estimation. The
=polytomous dependent variable, preg‘gnancy outcome, uses the four categoSries: PRETERM-LBW, IUGR-LBW,
SLOSS, and NORMAL birthweight
S(latter category as reference category).
‘Estimation of a multinomial logit
Sinodel i is analogous to the simultaneous
Sestimation of several binary logit mod‘eels: a set of J-1 coefficients is estimated
for each explanatory variable, where J
Sequals the number of categories of the
‘Sdependent variable. The estimated coSefficients indicate the effect of the in‘Edependent variables on the log-odds
O(or odds when exponentiated) of each
adverse outcome category relative to
the normal birthweight category.
Model estimation was carried out using
Systat 5.1 (Steinberg and Colla, 1991).
The analysis focuses on the effect of
IPI on each outcome net of demographic control variables, rather than
on quantifying the extent to which demographic variables account for the
IPI effect. I present the results from
one final model (Table 2) that simultaneously includes the predictor vari

ables: age at pregnancy, pregnancy order, race, prior pregnancy outcomes,
smoking, and interpregnancy interval
(IPI). None of the intercorrelations
among the independent variables in
the model are high, and there is little
evidence of multicollinearity. For example, the correlation between IPI and
age at pregnancy is 0.36; IPI and pregnancy order are correlated at —0.13.
Given the sample sizes relative to the
number of independent variables, interaction tests had to be limited.
Dummy variable coding is used for
all categorical variables with the exception of IPI, for which marginal (effect)
coding is used. The coefficients based
on marginal coding are interpreted as
the ratio between a particular IPI
group’s odds relative to the “‘average”’
odds (unweighted mean odds) for all
categories combined. Marginal coding
will facilitate the interpretation of interactions between IPI and other variables in the model, as described later.
Marginal and dummy coding yield results that are identical with respect to
model fit (model chi-squares and loglikelihoods) and predicted probabilities, the latter being the primary mode
of communicating the effects of IPI.

MULTIVARIATE RESULTS

The odds ratios, calculated by exponentiating the log-odds coefficients
from the regressions, are shown in Table 2. They are adjusted for all other
independent variables. In discussing
the odds ratios, all comparisons involve the particular pregnancy outcome in question relative to the normal
birthweight outcome (reference category), as described above. Looking at
the control variables first in Table 2,

age at pregnancy outcome has significant effects only on the risk of fetal loss
(relative to normal birthweight outcome). The age 15-24 group is almost
twice as likely to have a loss relative to
the reference group (ages 25~34) while
the age 35+ group is more than two
and a half times more likely to have a
loss relative to the reference group
(ages 25-34). Age has no effect on the
LBW outcomes, however. Other operationalizations of the age variable,
such as allowing it to be continuous
with polynomial terms, did not yield
significant coefficients or improve the
fit of the model.

A higher pregnancy order (ORDER) significantly raises the odds of
fetal loss, but not PRETERM-LBW or
IUGR-LBW which is consistent with
most other research.

Blacks are 2.6 times more likely
than whites to have a PRETERMLBW outcome, and 4.4 times more
likely to have an IUGR-LBW, net of
other variables. There is no race difference in fetal loss, however.

Higher EDUCATION level has no
significant effect on the LBW outcomes (although the coefficient for
PRETERM-LBW 1s almost significant:
p< 0.06) but significantly raises the
odds of fetal loss. The latter is a surprising finding; the same direction of
relationship appears at both univariate
and multivariate levels. Education differentials in the completeness of reporting pregnancy loss in the interview
is possible; Casterline (1989) also
found a significant positive effect of
education on fetal loss for some developing countries.

had a LBW outcome (without distinguishing prior PRETERM-LBW and

uprior IUGR-LBW), the odds of subseSjuent PRETERM-LBW are raised by
‘a factor of 3.4; T'UGR-LBW, by a facfOr of nearly 3.8; and LOSS, by a factor
®f 1.9. A prior pregnancy ending in
Aloss raises the odds of PRETERM4LBW by a factor of 3, does not signifNcantly raise the odds of IUGR-LBW,
cand raises the odds of LOSS by a factor

EFFECTS OF INTERPREGNANCY
INTERVAL

Interpregnancy interval significantly
improves the fit of the multinomial
model (p < 0.001) according to likelihood ratio tests. When IPI is added
to a model containing the variables
discussed thus far, the —2 LL (loglikelihood) equals 185.45, df=36. The

 

Interpregnancy Intervals

 

model not containing IPI has a —2 LL
of 151.54, df=24. Other operationalizations of IPI, such as specifying IPI as
a continuous variable with polynomial
terms (quadratic and/or cubic), do not
improve the model fit.

We would expect that some of the
factors determining pregnancy spacing
are different when prior fetal loss is involved. It has been shown that women
tend to conceive sooner following a
loss than following a live birth (Zimmer, 1979), and prior loss is itself a determinant of pregnancy spacing. Additional biologic determinants become
relevant when prior loss is involved,
such as the shorter period of postpartum amenorrhea and (in some populations) a. shorter anovulatory period
following a loss. Social psychological
processes may operate differently as
well. There is also evidence from previous research that the effect of IPI
partly depends on whether the previous outcome was a loss or not, with
short IPI following a loss having less of
an adverse effect or none at all (Institute of Medicine, 1985).

As a first step in the multivariate
analysis, I tested an interaction between prior loss and IPI. The overall
interaction was not significant (p=
0.23) according to likelihood ratio tests
in which a model that includes all of the
IPI*PRIORLOSS interaction terms
was compared with the previous additive model. Small cell sizes (few prior
losses within IPI categories) could account for the nonsignificance. Using
several datasets from developing countries, Casterline (1989) also found no
interactive effect between IPI and
prior loss. I will come back to this interaction question after presenting
the IPI results based on the additive
model.

Predicted probabilities of adverse
outcomes, setting the other independent variables to their mean values,
give an interpretable picture of IPI effects on the outcomes. Below, I will refer to IPI of 0-6 months as IPI(0~6),
and so on. In Figure 1 (derived from
Table 3), short and long intervals carry
a higher risk of both LOSS and IUGRLBW, with the IPI effect on LOSS being steeper and having an earlier “optimum” point (at 7-12 months for
LOSS, and 13-24 months for IUGRLBW). The pattern for PRETERMLBW is ambiguous and resembles
random fluctuations; there is little evidence that shorter intervals raise the
risk of PRETERM-LBW. The “‘peak”’
for PRETERM-LBW at IPI(25-48) is
statistically significant (relative to the
average probability, which I am not
able to explain other than by attributing it to random fluctuations). Finally,
the shapes of these probability graphs
generally remain unchanged when independent variables (such as age and
pregnancy order) are set to values
other than the mean.

The overall interaction between IPI
and PRIOR LOSS yields a pattern of
coefficients (not shown) in which the
adverse effect of short intervals on
each outcome was dampened when
prior outcome was a loss. Specifically,

 

Social Biology

the coefficients of the IPI(0-6)* PRIORLOSS terms (one for each outcome
model) were negative and nearly significant in each outcome model. Recall
that IPI is coded using the marginal
method (and PRIOR LOSS is coded
as a [0,1] dummy variable). The aforementioned interaction coefficient,
then, means that the ratio (or difference) between the odds of an adverse
outcome for the IPI(0-6) group and
the average odds is smaller when prior
outcome is a loss. Note also that there
are five possible interactions terms
within each outcome model: IPI(O—
6)*PRIORLOSS, IPI(7-12)* PRIORLOSS, IPI(13-24)*PRIORLOSS, IPI
(25-48)*PRIORLOSS, and_ IPI(49PLUS)*PRIORLOSS. The _ second
term was generally less significant than
the first, the third was less than the second, etc., in each outcome model, suggesting that the effect of short IPI’s is
more sensitive to prior outcome than is
the effect of longer IPI’s.

I also looked at predicted probabilities based on a model in which IPI(06)*PRIORLOSS was included, since
this is the “part” of the overall interaction between IPI and PRIOR LOSS
that appeared to be most important
(and it is not mathematically necessary
to include all of the components of an
overall interaction in the equation). I]

generated two probability graphs (of
the type in Figure 1) from a model that
includes the (“‘part’’) interaction term,
One graph was produced with PRIOR
LOSS set to “‘yes’’ in the equation and
one based on PRIOR LOSS set to
“no”? in the equation (in both cases
with the other variables set at their
means). The graphs were similar, and
both of them, but especially the latter,
look similar to Figure 1. But, in the
PRIORLOSS = yes graph: (1) the adverse effect of short intervals on LOSS
is weaker (the line starts off lower) due
to the interaction; (2) the adverse effect of shorter IPI’s on IUGR-LBW

almost disappears; (3) IPI(O-6) group
has an even lower risk of PRETERMLBW but its shape still appears to be
random.

Conversely, in the PRIORLOSS =
no graph, the adverse effect of short
intervals is accentuated for each outcome —the lines all start off at a slightly
higher point. Thus, there is an indication that the adverse effect of short intervals on each of the adverse outcomes is dampened when the prior
pregnancy ends in loss. This is consistent with some other research that
examined this question and may indicate that maternal resources are not

depleted to the same extent when a
prior pregnancy aborts. Still, the interactive effect of prior loss is weak in this
analysis.

DISCUSSION

The analysis indicates that short and
long interpregnancy intervals increase
the risk of both TUGR-LBW and
LOSS. The minimum points of their
U-shaped curves in Figure 1 occur at
different IPI categories. The effect of
IPI on PRETERM-LBW shows no discernible trend. The absence of an effect of short IPI on PRETERM-LBW
was partly expected (Lang, 1990), although some of the other research
which shows that gestational age explains some of the birth-intervalperinatal-mortality relationship (Miller, 1989) or the birth-interval-LBW
relationship (Gribble, 1991) would
seem to predict an adverse effect of
short IPI on PRETERM. Larger samples and replications are required to
answer this question.

Ferraz et al. (1988) examined IPI effects on PRETERM and IUGR separately, using hospital data from Brazil.
They found no effect of IPI on PRETERM, but there was an effect of short
IPI on IUGR, both of which are consistent with my findings. When they
included maternal postpartum body
weight in their model (their proxy for
prepregnancy weight and inpregnancy
weight gain), the IPI effect on IUGR
became insignificant, which suggests a
possible causal mechanism. Lieberman
et al. (1989), using Boston hospital
data, examined the IPI effect on IUGR
only and found that IPI’s of less than
three months carried the highest risk,
the lowest risk being at 24-36 months.

 

Social Biology

This finding is somewhat consistent
with my findings, although our categorizations of IPI differ.

My results show an increase in risk
at longer IPI, for IUGR-LBW and
LOSS especially. Ferraz et al. (1988)
did not look at this question. Gribble
(1991), using Mexican data, found
that long intervals raise the LBW risk.
Spiers and Wang (1976) reported that
intervals greater than 47 months raised
the risk of LBW using U.S. data. There
is Some suggestion in the Lieberman et
al. (1989) study of an increased risk of
IUGR at longer IPI’s.

The increasing risk of LOSS occurring after the IPI(7—12) group in Figure 1 is noteworthy because both age
and pregnancy order are fully controlled. Casterline (1989) also reported
a U-shaped risk for fetal loss and a
strong effect of long intervals in some
developing countries but not in others.
The finding may reflect lower fecundity, possibly a phystological condition
that affects both the ability to conceive
and the ability to carry a pregnancy to
term. Although I controlled for a few
of the demographic variables which
are correlates of both the probability
of conception and the probability of
pregnancy loss—namely, age, and possibly pregnancy order, education, and
smoking—other “‘third”’ variables that
are common determinants of conception and loss (various health conditions) were not controlled.

The observed increase in risk of
pregnancy loss with longer IPI may
also be an artifact of unreported losses,
if IPI’s appear in the data to be “‘long”’
because some losses are not recognized
and/or not reported. If this underreporting is more common among highrisk women, then the risk of loss would
 

 

   

Vol. 39, No. 3-4

    
   

appear to rise with longer IPI’s. Underreporting of previous loss could also
lead to artifactual effects of long IPI on
IUGR-LBW and PRETERM-LBW,
though there was little evidence of an
IPI association with the latter. The underreporting of previous induced abortions may also be part of the explanation. Because this study is based on
retrospective pregnancy history data
sand depends on accurate recall of
“events, such questions of data quality
must be reconsidered. There are several potential sources of error in reAcalled data, involving both underreporting (nonreporting) of events and
~ inaccurate dating of events that are re
UNDERREPORTING

Although the data quality appears
oto be sufficient based on comparisons
= with vital statistics, some underreportSing most likely has occurred for pregFnancy losses, especially those occurD ring earliest in pregnancy. Unreported
‘events such as losses would be mani—fested as unreported pregnancies in the
E'NSFG (i.e., they would not enter the
2 "3 NSFG dataset at all). Pregnancy losses
6 occurring farthest from the survey date
§ probably have a higher omission rate,
A independent of the higher rate of omis
sion that probably occurs for early
gestation losses (Leridon, 1976). Although the fetal loss rates in this study
are lower than estimates from other

(mainly clinical) studies, the NSFG

loss rates do not decrease with time

from the survey date in this study
sample.

In a study of recall error in the reporting of spontaneous abortion, Wilcox (1984) found that 82 per cent of

spontaneous abortions occurring up to

Interpregnancy Intervals

ten years earlier were recalled by respondents, when they were recontacted several years later in a survey
that was a followup to a clinical study
of menstrual cycles. It is not known
whether the 82 per cent figure would
apply to the NSFG respondents who
were administered structured interviews that probed for complete pregnancy histories (I include all losses in
this study, not just spontaneous abortion). Although the probing techniques may be more elaborate in the
NSFG which could improve recall, the
NSFG respondents did not participate
in an earlier clinical study and thus recall could conceivably be lower.

RECALL OF DATES

The accurate reporting of dates of
events may be a more significant
source of error than is omission of
events. Since we are asking respondents to report reproductive dates up
to ten years in the past, recall error
probably increases through time. The
dates of outcomes (live birth or loss
outcome date) are subject to error, but
gestational age is probably more error
prone. The accurate recall of events
typically depends on factors such as
length of the recall period and saliency
of the recalled events, which, in the
case of pregnancy loss, might vary by
true gestational age. Pregnancy order,
parity, total number of losses, and
other factors may also play a part. Recall error can take the form of telescoping or event displacement, in which
events (probably more salient events)
are reported as occurring more frequently than they actually occurred.

Wilcox (1984) found considerable
error in recall of dates of spontaneous
abortion, although his study indicated
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:44 08 December 2015

244 Kallan

that random error, rather than systematic bias, predominates. For a twentyyear recall period (he did not provide
these data for the aforementioned
ten-year recall period), 61 per cent
were able to report a month and year
of the spontaneous abortion, and
among those, 66 per cent gave the correct date plus/minus one month. Tilley
et al. (1985), however, reported close
agreement between reporting of prior
pregnancies (including fetal losses)
and medical records in one clinical

Social Biology

sample, although timing issues were
not studied.

A few studies of recall of birthweight in self-report surveys have also
been conducted. Moreno and Goldman (1990) found missing data and response bias in reported birthweight for
a survey of mothers in Peru. Seidman
et al. (1987) found recall of birthweight
to be accurate, based on their comparison of retrospective self-reports with
hospital records for a small sample of
mothers in Israel.
