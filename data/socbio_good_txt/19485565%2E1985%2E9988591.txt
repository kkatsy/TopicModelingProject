Among Hispanics in a Southwestern City

ABSTRACT: From data on census tract groupings from Corpus Christi, Texas, for 1979-83, this
study shows that, unlike the inverse infant-mortality-socioeconomic-status association observed for Anglos, no such association exists for the Spanish surname population. This finding
is discussed in terms of recent research suggesting that the Spanish surname population of the
Southwest has lower infant death rates than expected from its generally lower socioeconomic

status.

Studies of infant mortality providing
breakouts in the data by socioeconomic
status (SES) or ethnicity are fairly commonplace, but examinations of neonatal, postneonatal, and total infant mortality by SES and by ethnicity are less
common. Although early studies suggested that the inverse relationship between SES and infant mortality might
have weakened almost to the point that
it became nonexistent (Stockwell, 1962;
Willie, 1959), more recent research
found that the inverse association remains strong (Brooks, 1975; Adamchak
and Stockwell, 1978; Markides and
Barnes, 1977; Stockwell and Adamchak, 1978; Antonovsky and Bernstein,
1977; Markides and McFarland, 1982;
Adamchak and Flint, 1983; Stockwell et
al., 1978).

Recent investigations of infant mortality in the Southwest have shown that
Spanish surname infant death rates are
lower than might be expected from the
relatively low socioeconomic standing
of the Spanish surname population (see,
for example, Gee et al., 1976; Bradshaw

61

and Fonner, 1978; Markides and Hazuda, 1980; Hedderson and Daudistel,
1982), a phenomenon that appears to be
confined to the neonatal component of
the infant mortality rate. Even though it
has been suggested that underregistration of neonatal deaths, particularly in
the Texas-Mexico border region, might
account for the lower Spanish surname
rates (Teller and Clyburn, 1974);
Powell-Griner and Streck, 1982), some
studies have concluded that the low
rates are real and may result from a variety of factors including protective cultural factors (Gee et al., 1976) and a migration selectivity effect (Markides and
Hazuda, 1980).

If the Spanish surname population of
the Southwest has lower infant death
rates than expected from its low SES
standing, it can be hypothesized that the
inverse association between infant mortality and SES observed in the general
population will be weaker among the
Spanish surname population. Thus,
whether because of cultural or other factors, lower SES should not translate into

markedly lower infant death rates than
observed among higher SES Spanish
surname groups. We examine the relationship between SES and infant mortality overall and separately within the
Anglo and Spanish surname populations of Corpus Christi, Texas, an attractive setting for such study because of
an even split in the city’s ethnic composition.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This investigation utilizes data from
the thirty-six Nueces County census
tracts wholly contained inside the city of
Corpus Christi. The local health department provided their most recent data on
infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality as well as access to individual
death certificates. Working back and
forth between these sources, we obtained data on infant deaths within each
tract updating those reported by the
Texas Department of Health. Subjects
were limited to Anglos (non-Spanish
surname whites) and those whites with
at least one Spanish surname parent.
Blacks were excluded because they
comprised less than 5 per cent of the
city’s population. We analyzed a fiveyear cohort in order to increase the stability of the death rates (Kleinman,
1976), and we selected the most recent
such cohort for which complete data
were available, 1979-1983.

Information from the 1980 U.S. census was utilized to divide the thirty-six
census tracts into three SES groups. We
chose three appropriate census variables (the percentage of people twenty—
five-years—old or greater who are high
school graduates, the percentage of
families living below the poverty level,
and the percentage of people sixteen—

years—old or greater who are employed
in managerial or professional occupations) to represent the three dimensions
of SES: education, income, and occupational status. After the poverty variable
was inverted, the three variables were
subjected to factor analysis and each
one loaded at around 0.90 on a single
factor generated by oblique rotation.
Pearson zero-order correlations were
calculated with the following results: for
education-income, r=0.861; for
education-occupation, r=0.863; and,
for income-occupation, r=0.733. The
thirty-six census tracts were ranked on
each variable using the formula [(X, —
L,)/(H,—-L,)] X 100, where X, equals
each tract’s value on each SES variable,
L, equals the lowest such value among
all tracts, and H, equals the highest such
value among all tracts. The three values
(range from 0 to 100) were then averaged, producing a composite SES score
for each tract. The census tracts were
then broken into three SES groups—
low (0 to 33.3), medium (33.4 to 66.6),
and high (66.7 to 100)—resulting in 11
low SES tracts, 11 medium SES tracts,
and 14 high SES tracts. Infant death
rates were conventionally calculated for
each SES group of tracts separately for
Anglos and Spanish surname persons
and overall.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The most immediately striking aspect
of the findings is the significant (p<0.05)
inverse gradient in Anglos between SES
and both the total infant mortality rate
(IMR) and the neonatal mortality rate
(NMR), a gradient which is nonexistent
in the Spanish surname population as
well as overall. In addition, Anglos and

*“ There are significant differences (p < 0.05) between Anglos and Spanish surname persons for all four IMRs and for all four
NMRs. There are significant differences (p < 0.05) between each adjacent SES group in Anglo IMR and in Anglo NMR.

Spanish persons differ significantly
(p<0.05) with respect to all IMR’s and
NMR’s. In the high and medium SES
groups and overall, all Anglo rates are
lower, while, in the low SES group,
Spanish surname rates are lower.

Taken together, these findings suggest that, among Anglos, SES is a crucial factor in infant deaths, whereas,
among the Spanish surname population, having a medium or high SES does
not offer any additional protection
against mortality. Alternatively, lower
SES does not translate into significantly
lower infant mortality among Spanish
surname persons. Furthermore, this
SES-infant mortality relationship is a
neonatal rather than postneonatal phe
nomenon. These findings provide support for the study’s hypothesis that the
SES-infant-mortality association is
weaker among Spanish surname persons than among Anglos. This analysis
also shows the importance of analyzing
the SES-infant-mortality association
separately by ethnicity.

These findings should be considered
tentative because they are from only one
Southwestern city. In addition, they are
aggregate in nature and are thus subject
to ecological fallacy problems. Finally,
small numbers of cases do not allow us
to say much about the postneonatal
component of the infant mortality rate.
The findings in relation to neonatal and
total infant mortality, however, are con‘40 08 December 20

sistent with recent literature on Spanish
surname infant mortality in the Southwest. Studies in larger cities and also
studies utilizing matched birth and
death records are needed to further
elaborate our findings.
