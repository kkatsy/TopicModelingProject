ABSTRACT: Differences among census tracts in academic performance are estimated and related
by path analysis to social class, race, and school characteristics in the only American state without local autonomous school districts. Contrary to the Coleman Report, school has a significant
effect and race does not, but social class is the major cause of census tract difference in academic performance. Without appropriate data on family resemblance, a genetic component in

class structure cannot be delineated.

Most studies of school performance are
motivated to detect reparable weaknesses
in the educational system or to elucidate
familial effects (environmental and genetic) which condition the success of educational policy (Jencks, 1972). Another interest in school performance is as an indicator of neighborhood characteristics which
influence health and welfare. Here we address the determination of academic performance among census tracts by social
class, race, and school characteristics. This
study leads to certain conclusions about
the causes of these differences and to estimates of census tract indices which we
believe will be useful for studies in epidemiology and the social sciences.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data consist of two files on elementary school attendance areas and census
tracts, respectively, together with a table
giving correspondences between the two
data sets so that school characteristics can
be distributed by census tract and vice
versa. The school file gives mean converted
scores for aptitude and achievement tests
and information about students, teachers,

and school administration during 1970~72
(published and unpublished reports of the
State of Hawaii Department of Education). The census tract file contains means
for variables from the 1970 census (US.
Department of Commerce publication
PHC(1)-~88 and unpublished racial frequencies tabulated for the Office of Human
Resources of the City and County of Honolulu). The table of correspondences provided by the State Department of Education gives for each census tract the number
of enumeration districts (estimated by inhabited area to two decimal places) which
were included in a given elementary school
attendance area in 1971~72. These data are
described more fully below.

Test means from the school file were reduced to a correlation matrix which was
submitted to two principal component
analyses to determine the first eigenvector
of the original matrix, which defines general performance, and the first eigenvector
of the centroid-adjusted matrix, which defines specific performance by maximizing
divergence among tests. The latter is virtually identical to the second eigenvector
of the matrix before centroid adjustment

(Lalouel, 1973). The scores defined by
these vectors were regressed on school
characteristics to give indices of academic
performance (Morton, 1974). Finally,
scores and student variables were converted to census tract estimates, weighting
by the number of enumeration districts included in that school attendance area from
the given census tract. Regression on class
and racial variables gave indices for path
analysis of variation in school performance
among census tracts (Rao et al., ms.). By
these procedures, the main technical difficulty of the material, that some variables
are known only for school districts and
others only for census tracts, is effectively
overcome.

RESULTS
THE SCHOOL FILE

All public elementary schools in Hawaii
administered School and College Ability
Tests (SCAT) to grades 4 and 6, Sequential Tests of Educational Progress (STEP)
to grades 4, 5, and 6, and the California
Achievement Test (CAT) and California
Test of Mental Maturity (CTMM) to
second graders. Mean scores for grades
within school were computed by the Department of Education and made available
to us. There were 153 schools with information on all 17 tests. The correlation
matrix has only positive elements, and the
first eigenvector gives nearly equal weight
to each test. As in other studies, there is
no discrimination between ostensible measures of ability and achievement. After
centroid adjustment, the first eigenvector
is proportional to grade, reflecting rate of
change of performance with age in different
schools,

We shall call these vectors and the scores
which they specify performance (P) and
grade (G), respectively (Table 1). Relative performance increases with age in
schools with high values of G and de
Social Biology

creases with age in less favored schools.
For each vector v, the corresponding score
for the jth school is

17

y= ») U4 44/0; (1)
i=1
where x;; is the mean for the ith test in the
jth school and o; is the standard deviation
of the ith test among schools.

These scores were now regressed stepwise on twelve school characteristics (Table 2). Performance was not significantly
associated with small classes, high expenditure, or advanced teacher training, but
was significantly associated with high
teacher salaries and experience and low
cost per student. This pattern may reflect
attraction of experienced teachers from
small rural to large suburban schools, but
any interpretation must remain in doubt
until socioeconomic variables are allowed
for.

RACE

The 1970 census pooled part-Hawaiians
with Hawaiians, Puerto Ricans with Caucasians, and Samoans with “others.” Mixtures were classified by paternal race. The
random sample of the Hawaii Health Survey, which considers both parents for mixtures, gives correspondingly higher proportions of part-Hawaiians and “others.” We
are here concerned not with the genetic
composition of the population, but with the
association of ethnic group and performance. For this purpose, the imperfections
of census data are annoying but not critical.

When performance is estimated for each
census tract by the method of the first section and these estimates are regressed stepwise on ethnic proportions, weighting census tracts equally, means for each race are
obtained. Filipinos and Hawaiians score
low, while Orientals and Caucasians are
high. Caucasians and Japanese maintain
their high level from grades 2 to 6, but

or more in the same house, low fertility of
women 35-44 years old ever married, and
low student absenteeism. Incorporation of

obtained. Although still significantly higher
than the rest of the population, Japanese
are closer to the mean after covariance adjustment. Similarly, the performance of
Hawaiians and Filipinos improves. When
both class and school indices are used, the
racial differences become still smaller, and
the Japanese no longer significantly excel
the others. Racial differences in grade
score are entirely removed by covariance
adjustment.

Mayeske et al. (1973, p. 8) observed the
same tendency for racial differences on the
U.S. mainland to be reduced as more aspects of the background were taken into
account, with no substantial change in rank

order, and concluded: “Hence, we have accounted for almost all of the differences
among students in Achievement that are
associated with their racial-ethnic group
membership by considerations that are primarily social in nature and origin.” Similarly, Nichols and Anderson (1973) found
that most of the IQ difference between
mainland Blacks and whites disappeared
within neighborhoods, and Rao et al.
(ms.) concluded from path analysis of the
Coleman Report that at least 80 per cent
of the racial difference was due to covariance between race and cultural factors.
We would expect cultural factors to be at
least as important in Hawaii, because of
the short exposure of the low-performing
groups to the American milieu.

When census tract estimates of performance are regressed on the class, racial,
and school indices, all three partial regression coefficients are highly significant.
Thus, school characteristics contribute to
prediction of academic performance after
allowance for class and race, but one cannot say from this analysis whether the significant partial regression is due to covariance between schools and imperfectly
estimated class indices or to an independent effect of schools.

The same method which distributed
school performance among census tracts
gives class and racial indices for schools.
When performance is regressed on school
variables and the two indices, estimates
of the effects of school characteristics adjusted for covariance with the student body
are obtained. Performance is associated
with high teacher experience (¢ = 3.31),
low expenditure per student (¢ = —5.16),
and small classes (¢ = —2.26). No other
variable has a significant partial regression.
This is a much simpler pattern than was
obtained in Table 2 without covariance adjustment for student body variables. It
suggests that performance is optimized by

small classes, experienced teachers, and
large schools. However, the possibility that
these associations are due to inadequate
covariance control over student body variables cannot be excluded, since teacher and
school characteristics have not been (and
in part cannot be) randomized among
neighborhoods.

Grade score is negatively associated with
new teachers (¢ = —4.21) and high experience (t = —2.79). This finding suggests
that in schools where performance declines
with grade, teachers familiar with the
school but without long teaching experience
may optimize performance. If so, both inexperienced and highly experienced teachers
should be placed preferentially in the better schools, with rotation of moderately
experienced teachers through the lower
achieving schools. However, the usual caution about covariance analysis applies, and
this suggestion is at most a hypothesis to
be tested.

CENSUS TRACT SCORES
Performance is subject to errors of estimation due to small samples and conversion from school attendance areas to census tracts. It therefore seems useful to
combine these direct estimates with the
three indicators. Equation (1) gives the
score

y = 0.1535 P + 0.2097 S
+ 0.1759 C + 0.1856 R,

where P is performance and S, C, and R
are indices from school, class, and race,
respectively. If 4 and o are respectively
the mean and standard deviation of y
among census tracts with known P, S, C,
and R, a convenient index is y’=5-+
(vy —p)/o, which has a mean of 5, unit
variance, a range from 2 to 8, and approximates the probit of predicted school performance. Values of y’ have been filed with

PATH ANALYSIS

Covariance analysis, although useful to
predict performance, does not allow for
estimation errors in the independent variables and therefore gives no rigorous evidence on causation. Path analysis, however,
allows us to test causal hypotheses (Rao
et al., ms.). We are especially interested
in the hypothesis that race and school characteristics are related to performance only
through their covariance with class and are
therefore not causal. The alternative hypothesis is that race and school characteristics are not collinear with class but exert
an independent effect on performance. Such
an effect of school variables must be environmental, but a racial effect could in
principle be genetic. Without critical data
on family resemblance, there can be no
distinction between genetic and environ
mental effects. The logical error that noncollinearity of race and class implies a genetic effect of race has plagued behavior
genetics. Here we use a different and valid
principle, that rejection of the null hypothesis of collinearity is a necessary but not
sufficient condition for asserting a genetic
component in racial effects.

Correlations between indices and effects
are given in Table 4. No model without
school as a cause was acceptable (P<
0.05), in contrast to the Coleman Report
on U.S. schools where effects of statewide
educational systems were swamped by local

racial effect which was significant in the
Coleman Report is nonsignificant in Hawaii (Figure 2, Model 1). The best fit is
obtained when race acts on grade score but

racial effect on performance is not excluded
(Model 3). Assumptions about the precision of indices have appreciable effects
on tests of goodness of fit and estimates
of relative direct effects. However, extensive trials of alternative models did not
improve the fit or substantially alter the
conclusions of Figure 2. The relative direct
effects of school and race are about 0.3,
indicating that two random schools or
races differing by 15 points in performance
would differ by only 4-5 points if the other
causes were randomized. The relative di

rect effect of social class is at least twice

Report.

DISCUSSION

The primary objective of this study was
to estimate census tract scores for academic
performance to be used as social indicators.
A second objective was to infer the causes
of differences in performance among census
tracts. Path analysis suggests social class
as the main determinant, but a significant
effect of school characteristics. Unlike the
national survey in the Coleman Report,
neighborhood socioeconomic differences do
not swamp regional efforts to provide equal
educational opportunity in the only American state which has no autonomous local
school districts. Elsewhere, school districts
depend largely on their members for direction and tax support, with consequences
that are highly predictable from sociocultural indices.

Despite the considerable cultural and
linguistic differences among ethnic groups
in Hawaii, race exerts all or most of its
effect on academic performance through
covariance with class and school characteristics. It is therefore unlikely that racial
differences in Hawaii are to any appreciable extent genetic, but a rigorous test
would require a study of resemblance of
half-sibs or foster sibs in racially mixed
families. Of more practical interest is the
suggestion from covariance analysis that
high teacher experience, large schools, and
small classes enhance general academic
performance, while teachers familiar with
the school but without long teaching expeience may have the best effect in schools
where performance declines with grade.

On the U.S. mainland there is a significant covariance between midparent genotype and family environment, accounting
for 12 per cent of the IQ variation of children (Rao et al., 1974). We might conjec

ture that the genetic component of class
differences in academic performance would
be less in Hawaii, because of the recent
exposure of the poor-performing groups to
the American environment. The only family study of academic performance in Hawaii did not use an index of family environment and therefore could not estimate the
genetic component in class differences
(Trimble and Mi, 1973).

Causal analysis in sociology traditionally
imposes one set of preconceptions, without
testing their goodness of fit or examining
other possible models. Our study illustrates
the alternative approach, in which con

ceivable determinate models are compared,
selecting those which are compatible with
the data. By accepting the scientific convention that error can be rejected, but
truth never proven, causal analysis can be
a valuable tool instead of an exercise in
solipsism.
