for American Preschool Children

ABSTRACT: This paper uses data drawn from the 1940 through 1980 Public Use Microdata
Samples of the U.S. Census of Population to document sibling configurations from the child’s
perspective. Changes in four aspects of siblings are examined for five cohorts of white and black
preschool-aged children: number, birth order distributions, spacing intervals, and sex composition. Changes in fertility behavior of adults in the post-war era had a profound effect on the
structure of sibling systems experienced by children. Successive cohorts of preschool children
show a rise in number of siblings through the early post-war years before showing sharp declines
in number of siblings through the 1960’s and 1970’s. These shifts in size of sibling sets are
reflected in changes in the proportion of each cohorts who are first born and only children, both
of which have increased substantially by the 1980 cohort. The 1940 and 1980 cohorts have similar
proportions of children with short intervals. However, the middle cohorts show the effects of the
quickened pace of fertility with substantial proportions of children with comparatively short birth
intervals. Finally, substantial shifts across cohorts in several measures of sex composition of
children are observed. Most significantly, there is a marked decline in the proportion of children
experiencing an opposite-sex older sibling.

Since the Great Depression, adults’ dren they bore over the past forty

childbearing behavior has dramatically
changed. The total fertility rate increased from 2.30 in 1940 to 3.77 by
1957, before falling to 1.84 in 1980 (National Center for Health Statistics,
1988). Furthermore, these fertility
shifts took place in almost every subgroup in American society, although
some, such as blacks and Catholics,
were more involved than others (Rindfuss and Sweet, 1977). The causes and
consequences of these changes have
preoccupied many American demographers for some time. How these shifts
have affected the lives of children,
however, has received surprisingly little attention. One major consequence
of fertility changes is expressed in the
experience of siblings. As women have
changed the timing and number of chil
27

years, the sibling experience of successive cohorts of children must inevitably
have changed.!

This paper represents an attempt to
document these shifts. Data drawn
from the most recent censuses will
allow us to see how preschool-aged
children from successive birth cohorts
systematically differ in sibling configurations. The focus will be on documenting shifts in four components of
the sibling system: number of siblings,
ordinal position, spacing intervals, and\
sex composition. A basic premise of

‘Not all changes in the number of siblings over
time (from the child’s perspective) are the result of
shifts in childbearing. Changes in the adoption rates
or the likelihood of more distantly related children
living in the home can also affect the experience of
siblings.

this paper is that sibling configurations
matter. That is, number of siblings a
child has, his/her birth order, the intervals between children, etc., have a
significant effect on that child’s development. It becomes important, then,
to track the changing structure of sibling systems across cohorts of children.
I begin with a brief review of the four
components of siblings to be examined, followed by a discussion of the
data used to derive the population estimates, the findings, and discussion.

COMPONENTS OF THE SIBLING
SYSTEM

Of all the configuration variables,
number of siblings has probably received the most research attention. A
number of studies have explored the
effects of size upon the “internal”
workings of families. Some report that
behavioral control, methods of rule implementation, and affection patterns in
families are affected by the number of
children (Elder and Bowerman, 1963;
Kidwell, 1981, 1982; Nye et al., 1970;
Peterson and Kunz, 1975; Scheck and
Emerick, 1976). Explanations for
these findings center upon the theoretical importance of numbers on the interactions of members of a small
group.

Others have focused on the consequences of various family sizes for children’s mental ability, school achievement, adult careers, or other
outcomes. Some studies suggest that
children from small families score
higher on intelligence tests and do better in school than children from large
families (see Rodgers and Thompson,
1985/1986, for a review). The conflu
 

Social Biology

ence theory, for example, suggests that
children’s intellectual development is
affected by two components, the intellectual level of the environment in
which they are raised, which is affected
by family size, and the intellectually facilitating influence of having a younger
sibling to teach (Zajonc, 1976; Zajonc
et al., 1979).

Judith Blake (1981, 1989) suggests a
“dilution model” of parental inputs as
a variation on the confluence model.
Here, simply the more children, the
more parental resources are divided
and hence “the lower the quality of the
output” (1981, p. 422). She maintains
that even when major cultural, period,
and socioeconomic variables are taken
into account, increasing family size has
an important negative influence on
children’s educational attainment. Despite differences in these two theories
on the role of birth order, both theories
agree that having a large number of
siblings is a disadvantage for a child
which even high family income and
high parental education does not easily
offset.

What can we expect in the way of
changes in number of siblings across
cohorts of preschoolers? Since the
baby boom did not represent a return
to the large families, but rather a
movement away from spinsterhood,
childless marriage, and toward the
one-child family, one might expect relatively small changes in average completed family sizes of children in the
1940 through 1980 decades (Preston,
1976; Westoff, 1978). However, the
baby boom was also characterized by a
shift in the timing of births with more
women having their children bunched
together at younger ages (Westoff,
1978). Other things being equal, this
Vol. 39, No. 1-2

bunching of births will tend to increase
family size as experienced by preschoolers in the 1950’s compared to the
early decades and the most recent decades. Thus we might still expect to see
some increase in the average number
of siblings. Conversely, a widening of
the birth spacing in the baby bust years
could function to accentuate the decline experienced in the preschool
wn years from 1960 onward.

S  Asecond dimension of sibling struc
tures to be examined is birth order. Al
though ordinal position has attracted

S almost as much attention through the

S oretically developed and much more

st controversial. As Schvaneveldt and

~ Ihinger (1979) note, studies in this area

5 investigation, although they are critical

3 of much of the research (Adams, 1972;

< Blake, 1989; Rodgers and Thompson,

= 1985/1986).

Q Much of this work concentrates on
birth order as a determinant of educational achievement, intelligence, aspirations, or various aspects of personality, and it emphasizes differences
between first borns and later borns. Although a number of different theoretical orientations have been employed
to explain differences by birth order
(see Rodgers and Thompson, 1985/
1986), it can be argued that an underlying commonality to a number of

 

Sibling Configurations 29

them is the emphasis on the uniqueness
of being first born.

With the birth of the first child, parents begin to “‘try out” their theories of
child raising. The birth of the first child
also initiates interactions between parents and other social institutions and
groups such as schools, church, peer
groups, and community groups, which,
to a greater or lesser extent, affect the
family system. Thus, with the birth of
the first child, and with each subsequent birth, the family system becomes
more “‘open.”’ The oldest child, then,
acts as a trend setter or trail blazer in
this process. The feedback from these
first experiences is likely to change
parenting behavior for subsequent
children. Later-born children have
parents who are more experienced and
thus more likely to be relaxed, not tentative, and possibly more tolerant or
permissive than they were for the firstborn child (Bossard and Boll, 1960;
Schvaneveldt and [hinger, 1979).

This line of reasoning fits well with
some commonly found birth-order patterns. For instance, first-born children
have been found to elicit higher parental expectations for behavior and performance, get more parental time and
attention, to be more conservative,
have lower levels of sexual activity in
adolescence, to have higher selfesteem, and have higher levels of educational attainment than later-born
children (Blake, 1989; Kammeyer,
1966; Kidwell, 1982; Lasko, 1954;
Lewis and Kreitzberg, 1979; Reiss,
1967; Rodgers and Rowe, 1988).

The distribution of cohort members
by birth order depends, in part, on the
sizes of families. Where the family
sizes of children are large, the ratio of
first born to later borns will be small.

As the average family sizes of children
decline, the proportion of children who
are first born will increase. We can anticipate, then a relatively small proportion of first borns for the baby-boom
cohorts compared to the preceding and
following cohorts of children.

A third dimension of sibling systems
is birth intervals. Demographers have
been interested in birth intervals because of their centrality in understanding the biological and social dimensions of the family formation process
(Hastings and Robinson, 1975; Menken, 1975; Tsui, 1982). Short intervals
imply more rapid childbearing, which
may result in an earlier age at last birth
or in larger families (Spanier et al.,
1985). Longer birth intervals may have
been intended delays because of labor
force involvement, residential or marital status changes, as well as unintended delays because of illness or
other involuntary factors (Groat, 1982;
Jones, 1981; Potter, 1963).

Social scientists also have been interested in the spacing of children because of its potential effects on child
development. Close spacing of children has been linked consistently with
negative effects on cognitive development. In contrast, wide spacing has
been found to be beneficial for the intellectual development of both the
younger and older child (see Wagner et
al., 1979, for a review of research in
this area).

There also has been some work documenting differing parenting styles by
the spacing of children. Parents of adolescents that are spaced less than two
years apart use more physical force to
control their offspring, although this
does not lead to more parent-child conflicts (Edwards and _ Braunburger,

 

Social Biology

1973). Kidwell (1981) also reports that
for adolescents, average sibling spacing is negatively related to perceived

‘parental punitiveness and positively re
lated to perceived parental reasonable
“ness and supportiveness.

Given what we know about the
changing amount and pace of fertility
since 1940, we anticipate relatively
large intervals for preschool children in
families with at least two children in
the pre-baby-boom cohorts. These intervals should decline as the pace of
childbearing increased in the 1950’s.
The most recent cohorts, however,
should show a return to longer intervals, reflecting the “baby bust”’ fertility
patterns (U.S. Bureau of the Census,
1978).

The final structural dimension examined is that of sex of siblings. It is
commonly asserted that the sex composition of the children in a family has
important consequences (Schooler,
1972; Schvaneveldt and Ihinger, 1979).
Nevertheless, there has been relatively
little done theoretically or empirically
to substantiate these claims.

One exception to this is the crosssex assimilation hypothesis developed
by Orville Brim (1958). Based on the
work of George Herbert Mead, Brim
hypothesizes that children with siblings
of the opposite sex will display more
traits of the opposite sex than will children who have siblings of the same sex.
Also, he suggests that children having
older opposite-sex siblings will display
the highest number of the traits of the
opposite sex. Support for this hypothesis is found not only by Brim, but also
by Kammeyer (1967). Extensions of
Brim’s cross-sex assimilation hypothesis can also be found in the work of
Reiss (1967) and Rodgers (1983) exDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:44 08 December 2015

Vol. 39, No. 1-2

plaining adolescent sexual behavior
and attitudes. Both found that sex
composition, especially that of the
older siblings relative to the child, has
a significant effect on a child’s attitudes
about premarital sex or their intercourse behavior.

In addition to Brim’s model, several
researchers have suggested that a
“unique gender status” in sex composition can account for some differences
between children. That is, being the
only male or only female in a family is
a Situation which can have special consequences (Elder and Bowerman,
1963; Schvaneveldt and Ihinger, 1979).
Kidwell (1982) tests several hypotheses
derived from this notion in her examination of determinants of self-esteem
in adolescent boys. She finds that the
disadvantage of a middle-born birth order is partially offset by characteristics
which enhance the distinctiveness of
middle-borns, prominent among them
the uniqueness. associated with being
the only male among a number of female siblings.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data for this paper are drawn from
the 1940 through 1980 Public Use Microdata Samples of the U.S. Census of
Population. A children’s file for each
census year was created, providing a
representative sample of all children
living in households with their parent(s). The record for each child contains information on the child, his or
her parent(s), and all sibling(s) of that
child living in the home. By definition,
children living in institutions or in
households where they are not related
to the head of the primary family or
subfamily were deleted from the files.

Sibling Configurations 31

It is important to note that in this
paper children are the unit of analysis.
Most previous demographic research
has taken the perspective of the household, family, or adults. As demonstrated by Preston (1976), however,
findings from adult-based data are not
necessarily indicative of the experience
of children. If we wish to know what
the consequences of changing fertility
are for the sibling experience of children, we must use children as the unit
of analysis.

The analysis is restricted to white
and black children aged zero to five at
the time of the decennial census. Thus,
information is available for five sixyear birth cohorts of children, starting
with the 1934-39 birth cohort and ending with the 1975-79 birth cohort. The
reason only preschoolers are examined
and not children of all ages is because
of an important limitation in these
data, that is, there is no information on
children who are 18 or older. This
problem is minimized by limiting the
analysis to preschool-aged children.
Nevertheless, the reader should be
aware that an unknown (but probably
small) proportion of preschool children who are designated here as having
no older siblings actually have a sibling
who is 18 or older.?

Siblings are defined as any “‘own
child”’ of the head of the primary, sub-,

Of course, by limiting the analysis to preschool
children, we miss younger siblings not yet born.
Thus, the actual number of siblings experienced by
these cohorts as they age through their life course
will be somewhat larger than the estimates derived
from these data. The number of additional siblings
born undoubtedly varies across cohorts with
changes in number of children born and fluctuations
in spacing intervals. Distributions of siblings could
be derived from completed fertility data for women.
Yet, this method is also not without bias as well,
especially from selective mortality.

or secondary family in the household in
the same primary, sub-, or secondary
family as the preschool child. No distinction is drawn in this paper between
half, step, or whole siblings. Undoubtedly there are important race and
cross-time differences in the likelihood
of having certain types of siblings. Unfortunately, the marital history information that was collected is not consistent across the five censuses. Since
this information greatly complicated
the definition of types of siblings, this
research was not pursued.

RESULTS
NUMBER OF SIBLINGS

In Table 1 we see that the post-war
fertility fluctuations caused large cohort differences in the distributions of
children by number of siblings. Looking first at whites, we see that tn the
baby boom years, there were increasing proportions of preschoolers living
in families with three or four siblings.
As one might expect, this was accompanied by a decline in the proportion of
children with no siblings. However,
there was also a decline in the proportion of children living in families with
six or more siblings. Thirteen per cent
of all preschoolers were living in families this large in 1940; but by 1960 the
proportion of these preschoolers was
nearly half that of the 1940 cohort, 7.6
per cent. In fact, the proportion of children living in a family with six or more
siblings declined steadily across all five
decades, and by 1980 less than 2 per
cent of white preschool-aged children
were living in this family context.

In more recent years, we see the
consequences of the well-known fertil

ity declines and the rise of the twochild family. From 1960 to 1980, the
proportion of white preschoolers without siblings nearly doubles (from 14 to
26 per cent) while the proportion of
children living with just one other sibling jumps from 30 to 42 per cent.
Thus, nearly 70 per cent of all preschool children in 1980 lived with just
one sibling or were only children compared to only 44 per cent in 1960.
The patterns for blacks are somewhat different, reflecting the higher average number of siblings experienced
by black children in their preschool
years. For instance, the proportion of
black preschoolers living in families
with a large number of siblings (6+ ) is
consistently three times that of whites
across all decades, while the proportion living in families with one or two
children varies from less than half that
of whites in the 1940’s and 1950’s to
about four-fifths that of whites in 1980.

BIRTH ORDER

The bottom panel of Table 1 displays the distribution of preschoolers
by birth order.* As expected, the increasing family sizes of children soon
after World War II are reflected in a
decline in the proportion of these children who are first born between the
first and second cohorts, while the proportion of children of higher order

3Children who are the products of multiple
births are all assigned the same birth order. For example, twins who are the third and fourth children
in a family are both designated as being third-borns.
One result is that I overestimate the proportion of
“true’’ first-born children. Fortunately, first-born
multiple births are rare, occurring at a rate of 6.7 per
1,000 live births for whites in 1964 and 7.8 per 1,000
per blacks (Heuser, 1967).

births increased. The ensuing cohorts,
however, have increasingly larger proportions of first borns. For whites, 29
per cent of the 1950 cohort were firstborn children. By comparison, 42 per
cent of the 1980 cohort are first-born,
an increase of nearly 45 per cent. For
black preschoolers, we find that the
proportion first-born nearly doubles,
from 17 per cent in the 1950 cohort to
34 per cent in 1980. Thus, the proportion of black preschoolers who are
first-born appears to be converging
with that of whites.

An important distinction is drawn
by some researchers in the birth order
literature between first-borns and onlyborn children. Blake (1981) notes that
while being an only child is widely regarded by Americans as a significant
handicap, there is almost no empirical
support for such a stereotype. In fact,
in her own analysis, she finds that only
children are, on average, intellectually
superior and achieve higher educational and occupational status. We can
see in the top panel of Table 1 that the
proportion of preschoolers who are
only children increased from a low of
14.4 per cent in 1960 to over 26 per cent
of all preschoolers in 1980. As a consequence, the proportion of first-borns
who are only children increased from
48 per cent to 62 per cent in 1980.
There are two possible reasons for this
observed increase. First, we are seeing
the consequences of adults choosing to
have only one child. However, there
may be another possibility. Given that
we are limiting our focus to children
aged zero to five, we may be seeing the
results of an increase in birth intervals.
That is, across cohorts, first-born children may be spending longer periods
of time as the only child before the sec
 

Social Biology

ond child comes along. This change in
timing, then, would accentuate the
proportion of children who are singletons for at least the first five years of
their life.

The results in Table 2 seem to support the later notion. Here we see that
the average interval in years between a
first-born and the second-born (only
for those with at least one sibling at the
time of the census) has increased from
1.9 years in 1960 to 2.3 years in 1980 for
whites. This suggests that we have to
be cautious about reading too much
into the 82 per cent increase in the proportion of only children among preschoolers from 1960 to 1980.

Is there any evidence that singletons
may be on the rise? Table 3 displays

the proportion of five-year-olds who
are only children. Here we see a large
jump in the proportion of only children
between 1970 and 1980 for both black
and white children. Certainly some of
these children will eventually acquire
siblings. However, given these children have already gone nearly six years
without gaining a sibling, which is
more than two-and-a-half times the average birth interval of both races, one
can reasonably assume that the majority of these children will continue their
childhood as singletons. Even those
who acquire a sibling will have spent
their early critical years as only
children—a _ socialization experience
strikingly different from that of those
children who either are born into an
existing sibling system, or in their preschool years acquire siblings to whom
they must adjust.

BIRTH SPACING

I begin with an examination of birth
intervals to the next youngest sibling.4

“The terms birth interval and birth spacing will
be used interchangeably. The analysis focuses on
the age difference between living siblings and does
not take into account the effects of mortality. Our
measures of birth intervals are somewhat crude because the age of individuals is only recorded as their
age in years as of April 1, the year of the census.
This, of course, introduces some error when calculating birth intervals. For example, a child who is
estimated to be three years older than a sibling may
actually differ in age by two years plus one day or by
four years minus one day, depending on the month
and day of birth of a child and the month and day of
birth of their sibling. However, population estimates of intervals from a particular census are
unlikely to be biased if one assumes that the distribution of children by time of year born is approximately the same as the distribution of siblings by
time of year born. Likewise, comparisons across
censuses will be unbiased if any differences in the
distributions between children and their siblings in
time of year born remain constant.

An additional source of error in estimating intervals comes from the fact that some children will
be the same age as one or more of their siblings be

In order to minimize the confounding
effects of age and interval, this part of
the analysis is restricted to five-yearolds with at least one younger sibling.
As is evident in Table 4, the likelihood
of having a younger or older sibling
varied considerably across cohorts,
and this finding needs to be kept in
mind when reviewing the changes in intervals.

Examining the changes for whites
first, we observe a marked increase between 1950 and 1960 in the proportion
of children having a sibling spaced
within two years. Most of this gain
came from a decline in the proportion
of children with siblings of a moderately close age (two to four years),
while the proportion in the remaining
categories remained relatively stable.
The changes in the post baby-boom
years presents a different pattern.
There was a dramatic decline in the
proportion of five-year-olds with short
intervals (less than two years); in 1980
it is half that of 1960. However, most of
this decline is accounted for by the increase in the proportion of children
with wide intervals. The proportion of
children with a sibling four or more
years younger increased from 21.5 per
cent in 1960 to 29.8 per cent in 1980.
The pattern of change for blacks is similar to that of whites, except for the
greater likelihood of blacks having
shorter intervals in every cohort. Note,
however, that this race difference appears to have declined since 1950.
cause of multiple births, blended families from remarriage, or possibly from adoption. The consequences of spacing could potentially be quite
different depending on whether one’s own sibling of
the same age is a twin, an adopted child, or the result of remarriage. Unfortunately, with census data
it is not possible to distinguish between these vari
ous reasons for multiple same-age children within a
given family.

Table 5 presents the distribution of
all preschool children by interval to the
next oldest sibling. For whites, the
changes from 1940 to 1960 show a
marked increase in the proportion of
preschoolers with a very short interval
(less than two years) between them
and their next oldest sibling. There are
either no changes or declines for the
rest of the intervals.

We observed a reversal of these
trends from 1960 to 1980. The proportion of white preschoolers with very
short intervals nearly halves, from 25
per cent to 13 per cent, while the proportion whose next oldest sibling is six
years or more increased from 15 per
cent to nearly one in every five preschoolers.

The changes for blacks follow a different pattern. In 1940 nearly 23 per
cent of preschoolers had an older sibling who was less than two years older.

By 1960, however, the proportion of
children in this situation had increased
by two-thirds to 37 per cent. In contrast
to whites, most of this shift came from
declines among the moderate birth intervals (two to three years), which
characterized 56 per cent of all black
preschool children with an older sibling
in 1940, but only 44 per cent by 1960.
There was very little change in the proportion of children with wide spacing.
Like whites, the changes from the baby
boom years to the present are marked
by an increase in spacing.

Evaluating the significance of the
shifts in birth spacing between a child
and their siblings in isolation from the
changes in the other components of the
sibling structure is problematic. However, we can examine the simultaneous
consequences of changes in family size
and birth spacing through measures of
family density.

A convenient measure of density
which combines these two aspects of
sibling structure in a_ theoretically
meaningful way was developed by Kidwell (1981). The formula for this measure Is:

1

B= 2 5;
where: D=sibling density, and
S; = the number of years between respondent (S) and each of his/her siblings (i). Summing the reciprocals of
the spacing between the respondent
and each of his/her siblings gives decreasing weight to siblings who are

- spaced further away. For example, two

children may each have one sibling,
but if one has a sibling three years different in age while the other child’s sibling is one year away, the former child

will score lower on this density measure. The assumption here is that the
particular combination of both the
number and the “‘distance”’ of a child’s
siblings are important factors in determining the impact these siblings have
on the child (Kidwell, 1981).

Figures 1 and 2 contain the distributions of five-year-olds by density. Limiting the analysis to five-year-olds was
done to include younger siblings. The
major shifts we observe for whites
(Figure 1) is the increased proportion
of children with very low densities
from 1960 onward. For instance, over
half of all white children have a density
between zero and 0.5 in 1980, up from
one-third of all children from 1940 to
1960. Black five-year-olds reside in
markedly more dense families than
whites in every decade, although the

BS

trend since 1960 is that of declining differences (Figure 2). As was true for
whites, 1960 marked the peak time in
terms of family density. After this
date, large declines in number of siblings and increasing birth intervals
meant the average density in 1980 was
half that of 1960. Also, like whites, the
changes in the distribution can be characterized by an increasing concentration of five-year-olds in one or two categories of density. In 1940, one-third
of black children had a family density
between zero and 1.0; this per cent increased to nearly 60 per cent by 1980.
Thus, both white and black five-yearolds are far less likely in 1980 to live in
crowded families than has been the
case for any time since 1940.

To summarize, calculations of the
age differences between preschool
children and their siblings reveal large
changes across cohorts. The average
interval between a child and their next
youngest or next oldest sibling declined
during the baby boom cohorts, but
then increased with each subsequent
cohort. Changes in a measure of family
density which reflects both the number
and the spacing of all siblings in the
family revealed similar patterns of
change for both whites and blacks.

SEX COMPOSITION

From the work of Brim (1958) discussed above, we know that having an
older sibling of the opposite sex represents a special milieu. Table 6 contains
the changes in sex composition of older
siblings. For whites, we see small
changes over time in the proportion of
males or females with only oppositesex older siblings. However, the proportion of children with older siblings
of both sexes has declined sharply

 

Social Biology

across the last three cohorts. Hence,
since 1960, there has been an overall
decline in the proportion of white preschoolers with at least one opposite sex
older sibling, from nearly half of all
children in 1960 to just over a third by
1980.

Black children present a different
pattern from that of whites, although
the overall differences in sex composition appear to be diminishing. The proportion of black males and females
with only opposite-sex older siblings
appears to increase consistently over
time, from about 13 per cent in 1940 to
25 per cent for females and 23 per cent
for males. This increase is offset, however, by the comparatively large declines in proportions of children with
older siblings of both sexes. As a consequence, the proportion of black children with at least one older sibling of
the opposite sex is consistently higher
in each decade than whites, although
this difference has declined over time.

Some researchers have suggested
that being unique in terms of gender
among one’s siblings can have special
consequences for a child (Elder and
Bowerman, 1963; Kidwell, 1982; Schvaneveldt and Ihinger, 1979). Of course,
we cannot determine who among our
preschoolers will spend their entire
childhood as the only male or female
child; but we can look at changes
across cohorts in the proportion of children who at age five are still the only
male or female among their siblings.
Looking first at whites (Table 6), we
see that the proportion who are the
only males or only females in their family has tncreased since 1950. Only
males, for instance, increased from
21.3 per cent of all five-year-old males
in 1950 to 29 per cent in 1980. Only

females show a similar increase over
this time period, from 23 per cent to 32
per cent. We see approximately the
same pattern of changes for blacks,
with the proportion of unique gender
children increasing across the most recent cohorts.

Obviously, as the number of siblings
declines, the likelihood of having a
unique gender status relative to ones’
siblings increases. However, the significance of this may not be as great as it
might first appear. It is possible that
the salience of this factor may be minimal where a child is the only male in a
two-child family. Here its effects may
be overshadowed by the fact that the
child either is a first-born or a lastborn—sibling roles which themselves
set a child apart. The unique gender ef
fect suggested by past research (the
mere fact of being the only boy or only
girl works to set one apart from one’s
siblings in terms of parental attention
and expectations) may operate most
powerfully for children with moderate
to large sibling sets. Given the large increases in two-child families and the
decline in large families in the three
most recent cohorts, it is possible that
the recent increases in the proportion
of unique gender-status children may
not mean as marked a shift in developmental context as first appears.

order has gone through considerable
change across these five cohorts. Despite this change, little thought has
been given to the consequences of
these cohort shifts. If the unique socialization experience of first-borns sets
them apart from later-borns on some
characteristics, what are the consequences for these cohorts of being increasingly made up of first-borns since
1960?

The same question can be asked in
regard to the changes in family size. Judith Blake (1985), for one, suggests
that the declines in family size were a
major factor in the rise in levels of education for men in the last half century.
She concludes from her analysis that
the increased upward educational mobility that Featherman and Hauser
(1975) found was the case for men was
actually due almost entirely to the experience of men from small- and
medium-size families. Thus, as Hernandez (1986) notes, Blake’s research
highlights the fundamental role number of siblings plays in the status attainment process by defining the conditions under which social mobility has
increased in America. To the extent
that birth order and number of siblings
are Salient features of childhood, and
they influence in patterned ways the
kinds of adults that individuals become, we must take them seriously as
mechanisms of social change in society
when the distribution of cohorts of individuals by these characteristics
change. Perhaps we could learn something about the consequences for the
1980 cohort of having high proportions
of children who are first-born, only
children, and small sibling sets by
studying the 1940 cohort, which had

Sibling Configurations

similarly high proportions of these
characteristics.

What might be the consequences of
the declining likelihood of preschool
children having closely spaced siblings
or living in crowded families? One
might anticipate that the negative features of short intervals documented in
the literature, e.g., poorer health of
children, reduced individualized parental attention, less sibling competition, more positive parenting styles,
poorer cognitive development, will be
less common among the more recent
cohorts of children relative to the past.
Of course, a test of this hypothesis is
not possible with census data.

The social, psychological, and developmental consequences of the observed cohort changes in sex composition for the lives of children remain
unexamined. Will successive cohorts of
boys have fewer “feminine” traits as
fewer and fewer of them are exposed to
older sisters? Existing research suggests that this will be the case. But on
the other hand, the social world of preschool children of the recent cohorts is
increasingly marked by the experience
of nonfamily child care arrangements.
Preschool children with mothers in the
labor force increased from 29 per cent
in 1970 to 43 per cent by 1980 (Eggebeen 1986, 1988), and the figure is projected to climb to over 70 per cent by
1995 (Hofferth and Phillips, 1987). In
the majority of cases, the mothers of
these children work full-time (Eggebeen 1986), suggesting a growing proportion of children are likely spending
a significant part of their day in childcare. These experiences with nonfamily childcare arrangements mean children are probably much less “closed

42 Eggebeen

off’ from nonfamily individuals than
has been the case in the past. Thus, the
consequences of the decline of siblings
with its loss of opportunity for crosssex modeling, may be offset to some
degree by the gain in opportunities for
cross-sex modeling and imitation that
exists for children in day-care settings.

On the other hand, there have been
changes which might serve to offset to
some degree these potentially positive
gains. Increasingly, preschool children
are spending time in some form of
group care outside the home (Hoffreth
and Phillips, 1987). Of course, the
amount of time this involves varies
widely. For some children this means a
nursery-school setting for a small part
of their day a year or two before they
start kindergarten. At the other extreme are children whose parents are
working full-time, and group care ts a
major part of their lives and in some
cases has been since birth—a situation
which is becoming more common. For
example, the proportion of children
whose mothers are employed full-time
and who are in group care has steadily
increased from 6 per cent of all children under age three in 1965 to 16 per
cent in 1982 (Hoffreth and Phillips,
1987). This growing trend raises questions about its consequences. How
does this group care experience differ
from growing up in a home with a large
number of closely spaced children? Do
children compete in analogous ways
for the attention and affections of the
teacher/childworker? These are questions that cannot be answered with
census data, but they merit attention in
the future.

Another social change which may
have important implications for understanding the consequences of changing

Social Biology

sibling structures is the recent rise in
mother-only families due to divorce
and nonmarital childbearing. One implication is that the potentially positive
gains to children of declining number
of siblings is at least partially offset by
declines in the number of parents living
with children (Hernandez, 1986). Furthermore, the changes in gender composition of families of children is affected not only by the gender
composition of the children, but also
by the fact that children of divorce usually reside with their mothers (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 1988). Finally,
divorce and its aftermath—custody,
visitation, and eventually remarriage —
present the possibility that children’s
experience of siblings may be much
more complex and dynamic today than
was the case for earlier cohorts. Thus,
we need to be cautious in assessing the
consequences of any single change in
isolation from other social changes that
are taking place in the lives of children.

Finally, most of this discussion has
focused on the short-term implications
of shifts in sibling structures, but
clearly there are long-term consequences as well. As many others have
noted, declines in numbers of children
per family has significant implications
for parent care in later life (Bengtson
and Dannefer, 1987; Eggebeen, 1991;
Hagestad, 1986; Preston, 1984). However, the long-term implications, if
any, of changes in spacing, birth-order
distributions, and gender composition
are less clear.

In conclusion, the consequences of
the declines in family sizes since the
late 1960’s have been given considerable attention. Virtually ignored, however, has been its considerable impact
on the life course of children. Most

children today still grow up in families
with parents and siblings, but many aspects of life in families have changed
profoundly. We are only beginning to
examine the consequences of these
changes for children, families, and society.
