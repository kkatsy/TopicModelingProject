Anticipated Child Loss to Migration

 
   
 

ABSTRACT: Development today is commonly accompanied by rapid urbanization and, where
possible, high rates of migration to industrialized countries. At the same time, the expected
demographic transition has often not materialized despite decreases in death rates.
Child-to-woman ratios in St. Vincent and the Grenadines are related to the educational
attainment of women in a census district, the percentage of men engaged in agriculture,
whether the district has direct access to the outside world through a port or airport, and, when
the other variables are controlled, the stability of a district’s population. Those districts with the
greatest stability of population had the lowest child-to-woman ratios, suggesting that the
anticipated loss of children to migration may be an important factor in maintaining high

reproductive rates.

Two of the most important problems
facing developing countries are rapid urbanization in particular and overpopulation in general. Both problems cause
strains on local systems of roads, hospitals, and schools, create difficulties with
water and food supplies and with waste
disposal, and generally put pressure on
all sorts of natural and cultural resources. As development proceeds, the
concentration of population in urban areas commonly accelerates, but despite
increasing control over mortality, expected declines in fertility have not materialized, especially in rural areas. Demographers have focused attention on
the problems of migration and fertility,
and much is now known about these two
phenomena. Most research, however,
tends to concentrate on one problem or
the other, with the result that little is
known about the relationship between
these two forces.

 

   

The relationship between mortality
and fertility in the demographic transition is of critical importance to the development of population policy and is
one of the fundamental problems of demography (Parlange et al., 1983), but
Chu and Adamchak (1986, p. 86) have
recognized that the substance of transition theory is challenged by the failure
to take migration into account in most
transition research. The relationship between birth and death rates can be complicated to an unknown degree by migration. It is possible that the influence
of migration is at least partially responsible for slowing the demographic transition in many of today’s populations.

In studies that do consider the relationship between migration and fertility, the most common assumption seems
to be that high fertility in rural areas
causes population pressure, which leads
to emigration. Some areas apparently

depend upon the emigration of surplus
population to maintain favorable ratios
of land to people, or even to maintain
their viability (Bourdin, 1978; Eyre,
1972; Friedl, 1976; Gonzales, 1969;
Kloos, 1982; Pessar, 1982; Walker,
1968). But while a “‘surplus population”
model is logically appealing, it is difficult
to know whether high fertility rates do,
in fact, encourage emigration as implied. Arizpe (1981) has pointed out
that rural poverty existed long before
massive rural-urban migration began,
and therefore explains little by itself.
The same could probably be said of high
birth rates in rural areas. High birth
rates are generally characteristic of agricultural communities and therefore may
not be of much value in predicting the
volume of rural to urban migration. Pioneering new agricultural areas, intensifying production, adopting new crops or
new varieties of established crops, and
developing cottage industry are all possible means of accommodating a growing population without extensive migration to urban areas and without
increasing mortality. Income differentials between rural and urban areas may
be of more utility in predicting migration than competition for local resources
(Brittain, 1990q).

Friedlander (1983) concluded from a
study of population processes in
nineteenth-century England and Wales
that emigration and reductions in marital fertility are substitute phenomena,
with emigration being an immediate response and fertility reduction a delayed
response to population pressures caused

by the mortality transition. Those rural.

districts that had high rates of emigration showed much less reduction in marital fertility in response to lower mortality rates than would have been
predicted. And data from St. Barthé

lemy, French West Indies, suggest that
while the size of the birth cohorts apparently did not influence the probability
that their members would eventually
emigrate, as would be predicted by the
“surplus population” model (Brittain,
1990a), the crude birth rate was heavily
influenced by emigration.

Over an eighty-seven-year period,
34.08 per cent of the variation in the
birth rate for the rural population of this
island was determined by variations in
the rate of emigration five years earlier
as parents apparently responded to the
anticipated loss of their children
through emigration by increasing fertility in a process analogous to the more familiar fertility responses to expected
mortality (Brittain, 1990a). The concern
of parents to compensate for expected
child loss is not groundless, as rural to
urban migration can occur at rates exceeding the rate of natural increase,
leading to the debilitation and even collapse of some rural areas as ambitious
young adults depart, leaving the aged
and infirm behind (Brandes, 1975;
Eyre, 1972; Pessar, 1982; Schwarzweller
et al., 1971; Smith, 1976; Walker, 1968).

From the above discussion it appears
likely that there is some regular positive
relationship between fertility and emigration rates in rural areas. But high
rates of mobility are also characteristic
of some urban areas that have relatively
lower fertility rates. Urban areas in the
Caribbean, for example, are both the
destination of rural migrants from the
countryside and the point of departure
for major migration streams to the
United States, Canada, Great Britain,
and France. This paper investigates the
relationship between fertility and migration in St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
West Indies, a country which is characterized by high levels of mobility and by

levels of fertility that in 1955-60 were
“the highest rates ever attained by any
population in the English-speaking Caribbean” (Roberts, 1975, p. 2). Fertility
levels remain high, despite some recent
declines. It is hypothesized here that the
Jevel of emigration is a significant factor
determining the birth rate in St. Vincent
and the Grenadines for both rural and
urban areas.

BACKGROUND

ST. VINCENT AND THE PROBLEM
OF EMIGRATION

Social Biology

St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a
nation composed of the main island of
St. Vincent, located in the Windward Islands at approximately 61° 13’ West and
13° 15’ North, and the Grenadines, a
chain of smaller islands extending southward some sixty miles, from Bequia to
Petite St. Vincent, just north of
Grenada, St. Vincent itself 1s dominated
by La Soufriére, which last erupted in
1979, rising over 4,000 feet at the north
end of the island. St. Vincent has an area
of approximately 133.8 square miles and
a population estimated to have been
104,258 in 1987 (St. Vincent Statistical

Office, 1989). Most of the habitation is
concentrated densely on the fertile land
in the southern end of the island and
along the coast, away from the rugged
volcanic interior. The Grenadines, with
a total area of 16.5 square miles, divided
among forty or so small islands, support
a total population of approximately
8,331 (St. Vincent Statistical Office,
1989). The Grenadines are of considerably lower altitude than St. Vincent and
are therefore much dryer. While the primary occupation on St. Vincent is agriculture, a number of the Grenadines are
privately owned resorts and support an
enclave tourist industry.

At the time the Europeans arrived in
the Caribbean, St. Vincent had the largest Carib population of any island. The
European nations were initially unable
to subdue St. Vincent’s Caribs, and the
island became a center for resistance to
the invaders, sending war parties to assist the struggles of the Caribs in other
islands and welcoming those who were
finally driven from their homes (Kirby
and Martin, 1985). In 1660 the English
and French governments signed a treaty
with the Caribs, leaving them in possession of Dominica and St. Vincent (Williams, 1984). By this time, Barbados, to
the east of St. Vincent, was the largest
sugar producer in the Caribbean, supporting a system of plantation agriculture whose labor was supplied by African slaves (Williams, 1984). It
apparently did not take long for these
slaves to discover that boats and rafts
dnfting from Barbados would lJand on

- the coast of St. Vincent, taking them to

freedom (Kirby and Martin, 1985)..
The African newcomers to St. Vincent settled among the Caribs and
adopted many of their customs. Competition over females caused a rift, however, and in 1700 the Black Caribs suc
Child Loss to Migration 97

ceeded in claiming the eastern side of
the island as their own. A few French
settlers practiced small farming among
the Yellow (or Red) Caribs on the dryer
western side of St. Vincent, and the
British were able to begin settlement on
the southern end of the island around
the Kingstown harbor in 1762. However, it was not until the British finally
deported the Black Caribs to Roatan in
1797 that access was gained to the
Grand Sable area, near what is now
Georgetown, the area of St. Vincent
most suited to growing cane (Kirby and
Martin, 1985).

Under the British Emancipation Act
of 1833, there were 938 claims for compensation from St. Vincent, totalling
18,114 slaves, with three out of five
claims involving fewer than five slaves
(Williams, 1984). But land concentration had begun. In 1829, St. Vincent
contained 98 sugar estates totalling
37,842 acres. By the end of the nineteenth century most of the land was held
by only five owners, with two-thirds of
the island held by a single company
(Nanton, 1983). Absentee landlords
and idleness of arable land kept production at a minimum (Nanton, 1983; Williams, 1984), while the increasing population put mounting pressure on small
holdings (Nanton, 1983)—pressure
which has defied government attempts,
dating from as early as 1899, at solution
(Nanton, 1983; Williams, 1984).

Only a few indentured laborers immigrated to St. Vincent after the abolition of slavery (Roberts, 1975; Stone,
1973). Instead, the sugar industry declined, and Vincentians began leaving
their island in large numbers. The boom
in the Cuban sugar industry attracted laborers from St. Vincent throughout the
early 1900’s, some but not all of whom
returned home on a seasonal basis. In

1938 the daily wage for an unskilled
worker in the sugar industry in St. Vincent was 28 cents, while the minimum
wage in Cuba was 80 cents per day (Williams, 1984), an obvious motive for emigration. Arrowroot and bananas have
replaced the failed sugar industry in St.
Vincent (Mintz, 1985), but the seasonal
emigration of Vincentian agricultural
workers continues—to the cane fields of

Barbados and Florida, and to the vege-.

table and fruit farms of Ontario (Marshall, 1984).

Permanent as well as seasonal migration is of long-standing importance to
the population of St. Vincent. When La
Soufriére erupted in 1902-3, the colonial authorities organized emigration to
Jamaica for the dispossessed rather than
find them new homes on St. Vincent
(Nanton, 1983). In one study (Hourihan, 1973), every youth in Stubbs, one
of the villages on the southern end of the
island, expressed an interest in emigrating, and all of the youths interviewed
had either received or applied for a passport. Some of the permanent emigrants
may have entertained ideas of returning
to St. Vincent, but found themselves unable to do so for financial or other reasons, Certainly today, Vincentians who
entered the United States illegally are
reluctant to risk their present positions
with return visits.

According to the 1980 population
census of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, there were 15,419 net emigrants
between 1970 and 1980 (CARICOM,
1985, III, 3), an average annual emigration rate of 1.67 per cent. The population growth rate during this time averaged 1.17 per cent per year. Despite
increasing limitations to immigration
imposed by countries of destination,
many Vincentians continue to aspire to
emigrate. On the basis of interviews

conducted in 1989, it is clear that most
who express the desire have developed
strategies for achieving their goals despite the new restrictions.

For the most part, St. Vincent’s high
level of emigration has been seen as
beneficial, removing surplus population
and reducing levels of unemployment
(Hourihan, 1973; Marshall, 1984; Roberts, 1975). And remittances sent by relatives contribute to the standard of living of relatives left behind. But
emigration has negative effects that are
not as often mentioned. Remittances
can drive up the price of land and consumer goods and increase demand for
imported commodities. Marshall (1984,
p. 79) notes that the gross earnings for
484 Vincentian laborers working overseas in the United States, Canada, and
Saudi Arabia totalled EC $4.8 million in
1980, while manufacturing, employing
1,500 people, totalled EC $9.6 million in
1978. It may be that emigration itself increases the unemployment rate on St.
Vincent by creating higher expectations, and by removing the need for people supported by remittances to work in
poorly paid local endeavors in a process
similar to that described by Marshall
(1984) for the cane industry on Barbados. Mintz has pointed out that governmental and policy interest in industrialization at the expense of agriculture,
and high levels of emigration, pushed
Puerto Rico into a dangerous situation,
with a “denuded agrarian sector, a sugar
industry in rapid decline, and an enormous (and growing) bill for imported
food” (1985, p. 152).

Hourihan (1973) noted that unemployment among the youths of Stubbs
was made possible by the remittances of
relatives, and was seen as desirable by
the youths themselves. Today, older
Vincentians are concerned not only by
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:44 08 December 2015

what they see as an erosion of the desire
of the youths to work (apparently a concern of the older generation in many areas), but by the flight of the educated
and ambitious. Doctors and nurses, educators and government officials, engineers and skilled workers leave St. Vincent in a massive and continuing
brain-drain, and are very difficult, if not
impossible to replace.

One possible negative effect of emigration that is seldom mentioned is that
it may, in fact, encourage high levels of
fertility, thus contributing to the very
problem of overpopulation that it is supposed to help to solve. Despite extremely high levels of emigration, of the
seventeen Caribbean Commonwealth
nations, St. Vincent’s population “‘lies
somewhere around the middle as regards both size and growth rates’’
(CARICOM, 1985, III, 3). Emigration
may slow population growth by removing adults of reproductive age from the
population, but does not in itself reduce
the age-specific birth rates for those remaining in the absence of major alterations in the sex ratio (see Keyfitz, 1977;
Nag, 1980). If emigration is a stage in
the life-cycle for women who already
have children and whose growing families require more money than is available through local employment, the reduction in births caused by their
departure may be minimal. It is also possible that Vincentian women who are
seasonal migrants may come home to
give birth and leave their babies with
their mothers to raise, or that children
borne by Vincentian women living in
other countries may be sent back to St.
Vincent to grow up (see Bolles and
D’Amico-Samuels, 1989). Of the
foreign-born residing in St. Vincent and
the Grenadines, 28.6 per cent were children under the age of fifteen (CARI
 

Child Loss to Migration 99

COM, 1985, III, 14), many of whom
may be of Vincentian heritage. One
study found that fostering of others’
children was more common in St. Vincent than in either Antigua or Barbados,
with an average of 2.6 children fostered
per woman in the group studied (Powell, 1986). St. Vincent is considered a
desirable place to raise children because
of its low crime rate and reasonable cost
of living. If mothers act upon their convictions, the possible negative effects on
the birth rate of the emigration of
women of childbearing age may be reduced. There is evidence that both men
and women in St. Vincent “want a number of children as old-age insurance”
(Laufer, 1973, p. 49), and children are
an important source of household support for many Vincentian women who
head households (Massiah, 1986). As
the probability of the permanent emigration of their children increases, parents who are concerned for their own future may increase family size in a
process similar to that already described
for the population of St. Barthélemy
(Brittain, 1990b). The loss of children
through migration would perhaps be
most severe for those parents whose
own educational levels and resources
made frequent contact and visiting with
emigrants difficult. The hypothesis here
is that the level of emigration is a significant factor determining the birth rate
in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, with
high emigration levels causing high fertility as parents anticipate the loss of
children.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data for this paper are drawn primarily from the 1980-81 Population Census
for St. Vincent and the Grenadines prepared by CARICOM (CARICOM,

1985), supplemented by interviews conducted in St. Vincent and Bequia in
1989. In order to elucidate the relationship between emigration and the birth
rate, aseries of variables drawn from the
census was computerized for each of the
thirteen census districts of St. Vincent
and the Grenadines. Relationships
among the variables were sought using
SPSS-X stepwise regression procedures
(see Norusis, 1983, for details of computation).

Two dependent variables were considered, one the ratio of children under
the age of five to the number of women
aged fifteen through forty-four for each
census district, the other the ratio of
children under the age of fifteen to the
number of women aged fifteen to fortyfour. Both ratios were computed from
the population figures reported in the
1980 census and are taken as approximations of the levels of fertility in St.
Vincent and the Grenadines over the
five and fifteen years preceding the census. These figures are, of course, affected to some unknown extent by mortality and migration rates of both
women and children, but represent the
best estimates of fertility available. Parities and age-specific fertility rates are
not reported by districts in the census,
and the Digests of Statistics published
yearly by the Statistical Office of St.
Vincent and the Grenadines present the
numbers of live births for each of eighteen administrative districts, but these do
not correspond to the census districts,
making computation of exact fertility
rates impossible. There were 0.705 children under the age of five and 2.12 children younger than fifteen per woman
aged fifteen through forty-four in St.
Vincent and the Grenadines as a whole
in 1980.

Social Biology

Several independent variables were
considered as possible determinants of
the child-woman ratios of the various
census districts. These included the percentages of the male and female labor
forces employed, the educational levels
of adults of both sexes and of children,
and the percentages of households that
were headed by men. It was considered
possible that unemployment of both
men and women might affect the birth
rate if children were an important

source of household labor, if unem
ployed women were able to gain some
income through child support, or if large
families were one of the few sources of
prestige available to the unemployed.
Higher educational levels are often associated with reduced birth rates, and
households headed by women may have
lower birth rates than those in which
there is a resident adult male. Additional variables included the percentage
of men who were employed in agriculture and whether the census district had
direct access to the outside world
through a port or an airport. On the basis of studies in other areas of the world,
agricultural districts might be expected
to have higher ratios of children to
women than districts in which manufacturing or professional occupations were
more common. Direct access to the outside world would be a measure of the degree of contact with people and ideas
from other areas, including, perhaps,
changing ideas about the value of large
families or birth control. Perhaps this
would also be a measure of the probability of overseas migration if the observed
tendency toward stage migration, with
people from more remote villages moving toward the capital and people from
the capital migrating overseas, was statistically significant.

The mobility of the population could
be estimated from two statistics presented in the census. One was the percentage of the population of each census
district that was foreign-born. The other
was the percentage of people born in
each census district who were living in
districts other than the one in which they
were born. In 1980 2,111 of the total
census population of 97,845, 2.2 per
cent, had been born elsewhere, mainly
on other Caribbean islands, with some
also from the United States, Canada,
and the United Kingdom. No specific
records of overseas emigration from the
census districts are published, but according to the 1980-81 census (CARICOM, 1985, III, 3), there was a net loss
of 15,419 persons to emigration over the
previous ten years. For the purposes of
this paper, it was assumed that immigration, although of considerably smaller
magnitude than emigration, was proportional to it for each census district.
Many of the foreign-born living in St.
Vincent and the Grenadines are the children and spouses of Vincentians who returned home to live, so the assumption
is that for this group return migration is
proportional to emigration. There were
also some foreign-born who were living
in areas they had originally visited as
tourists, precisely those areas in which
Vincentians would be most likely to find
sponsors for overseas emigration. Interviews with residents of St. Vincent conducted in 1989 confirmed that those
from the most rural districts were the
least likely to have relatives living
abroad. The assumption of proportionality of foreign-born residents and emigration from census districts seems reasonable. The percentage of people born
in each census district who were still residents of St. Vincent and the Grena

dines but who were living in districts
other than the one in which they were
born was reported in the 1980-81 census
(CARICOM, 1985, HI, 12).

Moving from one district to another
in St. Vincent is qualitatively different
from moving overseas, and the available
statistics for estimating the size of migration streams are not strictly comparable.
A simple additive model for describing a
district’s mobility therefore does not
suffice. The total mobility of a district’s
population was assumed to be an interaction between local and overseas migration and was estimated as the product of the percentage of Vincentian
residents who had moved to other districts and the percentage of the district’s
population that was foreign-born. Stability of population, defined as the product of the percentage of St. Vincent’s
residents who were born in a census district who were still living in it at the time
of the 1980 census and the percentage of
the district’s population that was not
foreign-born, was also considered. Because deaths, like births, were reported
by administrative district and not by
census district, it was not possible to include district death rates as independent
variables in the analysis.

districts this figure ranged from a low of
67.22 per cent for Kingstown’s suburbs
to a high of 84.79 per cent for Sandy
Bay, the home of most of St. Vincent’s
remaining Carib population. The employment rate for Vincentian women
was lower than that for men, being 69.78
per cent for the nation as a whole, and
ranging from a low of 61.99 per cent in
Mariaqua to a high of 78.07 per cent in
the Northern Grenadines. Neither the
percentage of men nor of women working was related either to the ratio of children under the age of five to women of
reproductive age (r = 0.128, F(1,11) =
0.183, n.s.; and r= —0.149, F(1,11) =

0.217, n.s.; and r= —0.261, F(1,11) =
0.804, n.s.). The employment status of
adults in a district apparently was not a
significant factor in either of the ratios
of children to women in that district.

2. Educational levels of adults and
children.—Several measures of the educational levels of adults and children on
St. Vincent were extracted from the
1980 census for each district. These
were: the percentage of males and of females over the age of fifteen who had
less than five years of education, the percentage of males and of females over the
age of fifteen who had more than ten
years of education, and the ratio in each
district of residents in school to the number of children aged five to fifteen. For
St. Vincent as a whole, 5.67 per cent of
the men aged fifteen and older had less
than five years of education, while the
corresponding figure for Vincentian
women was 6.02 per cent; 14.15 per cent
of men and 15.76 per cent of women had
more than ten years of education. Neither the percentage of men nor of
women in the census districts with less
than five years of education was related
to the ratio of children under the age of

five to the number of women of reproductive age (r = 0.425, F(1,11) =
2.425, n.s.; and r = 0.278, F(1,11) =
0.921, n.s.). The percentages of men
and of women with less than five years of
education were not related to the ratio
of children under the age of fifteen to the
number of women of reproductive age
(r = 0.415, F(1,11) = 2.289, n.s.; and
r = 0.279, F(1,11) = 0.920, n.s.). Apparently very low levels of educational
attainment among adults did not contribute significantly to the birth rate.
The percentages of men and women
with more than ten years of education
were, however, significantly related to
the birth rate as measured by both the
ratio of children under the age of five
(r = —0.592, F(1,11) = 5.935, p<0.05;
and r= —0.654, F(1,11) = 8.221,
p<0.05) and of children under the age
of fifteen (r = —0.627, F(1,11) = 7.126,
p<0.05; and r = —0.683, F(1,11) =
9.618, p < 0.05) to women of childbearing age. As might be expected on the basis of research in other areas, those census districts of St. Vincent where adults
had the highest levels of educational attainment had the lowest birth rates. The
ratio of students to the number of children aged five to fifteen was unrelated to
the ratio of either the number of children under five or of children under
fifteen to women of childbearing age in
the various census districts (r = 0.343,
F(1,11) = 1.467, n.s.; and r = 0.418,
F(1,11) = 2.329, n.s.). Although there
was a tendency for there to be lower
birth rates in those districts in which
more children were in school, this tendency was not significant. To the credit
of the government of St. Vincent, the ratio of students to children from five to
fifteen was not significantly correlated
with any variable, including employment levels, the percentage of men em

ployed in agriculture, prosperity as measured by the percentage of homes with
electricity, or the distance to Kingstown.

3. Percentage of households headed
by males.—According to the 1980 census, 57.63 per cent of St. Vincent’s
households were headed by men, witha
range from 72.63 per cent in Sandy Bay
to 49.85 per cent in Barrouaille. Despite
the fact that married women and women
in common-law unions had age-specific
and total fertility rates that were substantially higher than those for women
in visiting unions (CARICOM, 1985,
III, 47), there was no significant relationship between the percentage of male
household heads in each census district
and the birth rates, as measured by either the ratio of the number of children
under the age of five (r = 0.176,
F(1,11) = 0.352, n.s.) or of children under the age of fifteen (r = 0.176,
F(1,11) = 0.201, n.s.) to women of
childbearing age. The gender of the
household head may not be an index of
the union status of its adult members.

4. Percentage of men employed in
agriculture.—Agriculture and forestry is
the largest category of employment in
St. Vincent. Of all of the men aged
fifteen and older living in St. Vincent,
24.48 per cent were in agriculture in
1980 (CARICOM, 1985, II, 174). This
was 37.4 per cent of the men who were
working, more than twice as many as
were employed in construction and installation (16.0 per cent), and more than
three times as many as were employed
in transportation, storage, and communication (10.1 per cent). Manufacturing was the sixth largest employer,
engaging 5.9 per cent of the economically active males (CARICOM, 1985,
III, 27). Food and animal and vegetable
oils together comprised 86.17 per cent of

St. Vincent’s export trade in 1980, witha
combined value of EC $34,695,000 (St.
Vincent Statistical Office, 1984, p. 48).
As expected on the basis of studies in
other areas, there was a high correlation
between the percentage of men over the
age of fifteen who were employed in agriculture and both the ratio of children
under five to women of childbearing
age, with agriculture explaining 53.68
wn per cent of the variance between census
S districts (r = 0.733, F(1,11) = 12.745,
BP < 0.01); and the ratio of children un‘gder fifteen to women of childbearing

A © per cent of the variance between census
S districts (ry = 0.729, F(1,11) = 12.482,
+p <0.01). Whether because children
“are of economic value to agricultural
% families, or because agricultural families
are more likely to hold conservative
-Zideas about childbearing and birth con3 trol, those districts that were most heay= ily dependent on agriculture had the
Shighest birth rates.
5. Ports.—It was hypothesized that
> those districts of St. Vincent that were in
‘5 greatest contact with the outside world
‘>,.would have lower birth rates than more
= isolated areas. There are airports near
“3 Kingstown at Arnos Vale, in the North-< ern Grenadines on Mustique, and in the
2 Southern Grenadines on Canouan and
Q Union Island. The banana boats dock at
Kingstown’s deep water wharf, and
there is now a jetty to serve the new industrial area at nearby Camden Park.
The Grenadines are a favorite area for
yachting enthusiasts, who frequent even
those islands which are inaccessible by
air. For the purposes of this study,
Kingstown and the Northern and Southern Grenadines were those districts
which were considered to be ports. Not
surprisingly, there was a significant negative effect of port status on both the ra
ersit

tio of children under the age of five to
women Of childbearing age (r = —0.643,
F(1,11) = 7.754, p <0.05) and the ratio
of children aged less than fifteen to
women Of childbearing age (r = —0.714,
F(1,11) = 11.440, p < 0.01). Those districts that had the greatest contact with
the outside world were those with the
lowest birth rates.

6. Mobility.—As previously mentioned, there are two independent measures of the mobility of the Vincentian
population. One, the percentage of
those born in each census district who
were still residents of St. Vincent, but
who were living in districts other than
the one in which they were born, was
taken to be a measure of local mobility.
We found that 21.4 per cent of the residents of St. Vincent who were born in

Sandy Bay, the most rural district on the

Windward side of St. Vincent, and 21.1
per cent of the residents of St. Vincent
who were born in Chateaubelair, the
most rural district on the Leeward side
of the island, were living in census districts other than the one in which they
were born at the time of the census in
1980. In contrast, only 4.5 per cent of
the residents of St. Vincent who were
born in Calliaqua, the fertile farm area
closest to Kingstown, were living in
other districts at the time of the census
(CARICOM, 19885, III, 12).

A second measure of mobility is the
percentage of foreign-born residents in
each census district. Two-thirds of the
foreign-born residents of St. Vincent
came from elsewhere in the Caribbean,
especially from Trinidad. Other immigrants came from Great Britain (16 per
cent), and the United States and Canada (10 per cent) (CARICOM, 1985,
III, 13). These areas of origin for immigrants correspond to the destinations of
emigrant relatives mentioned by resi

dents of St. Vincent in interviews conducted in 1989. Although it is impossible
to know how many of those born in each
census district eventually emigrated, it
was assumed that the percentage of emigrants for each district was proportional]
to the percentage of immigrants. The
two measures of mobility were not significantly related (r = —0.212, F(1,11) =
0.518, n.s.); the degree of local mobility
was independent of a district’s level of
emigration. |

Port districts were likely to have
higher percentages of foreign-born residents than were other districts (r =
0.794, F(1,11) = 18.765, p < 0.01), and
districts with the highest levels of agriculture were likely to have lower percentages of foreign-born residents than
were Other districts (r = —0.700,
F(1,11) = 10.569, p< 0.01), although
there was no significant relationship between port status and the percentage of
agriculture (r = 0.407, F(1,11) =
2.184, n.s.). Local mobility was unrelated to either the port status (r =
0.090, F(1,11) = 0.090, n.s.) or the
percentage of agriculture (r = —0.470,
F(1,11) = 3.119, n.s.) in a district.
There was a positive relationship between the percentage of males in a district with less than five years of education and its degree of local mobility
(r = 0.557, F(1,11) = 4.948, p<0.05).
Those districts with the lowest educational attainment for men were most
likely to have people born in the district
living elsewhere in St. Vincent and the
Grenadines.

The product of the measures of local
and overseas mobility was used to estimate the total mobility of each census
district. A simple additive model was
not considered adequate, as the methods of estimation were different, and the
two types of mobility might have differ
 

Social Biology

ent effects on the behavior of those left
behind. It seems reasonable to assume
that overseas migration would have a
great deal more impact than local migration as it removes people to a more remote location for longer periods of time,
requires a greater financial investment,
and has the opportunity for greater
financial return.

Both the percentage of those born in
each census district who were still living
in St. Vincent, but in districts other than
the one in which they were born, and the
percentage of foreigners in each census
district were significantly related to the
ratio of children under the age of five to
women of childbearing age (r = 0.591,
F(1,11) = 5.904, p<0.05; and 7 =
—0,739, F(1,11) = 13.236, p<0.01). Although local migration fell just short of
significance in its relationship to the ratio of children under the age of fifteen to
women of childbearing age (r = 0.505,
F(1,11) = 3.766, n.s.), the percentage
of foreigners in each census district
was significantly related (r = —0.743,
F(1,11) = 13.556, p<0.01). Apparently birth rates were highest in those
districts with high levels of local emigration, and lowest in those districts with
high levels of overseas migration. The
combined measure of mobility was related to neither the ratio of children under five nor the ratio of children under
fifteen to women of childbearing age
(r = —0.471, F(1,11) = 3.136, n.s.;
andr = —0.491, F(1,11) = 3.494, n.s.).

A stability index was also calculated
for each census district, this being the
product of the percentage of the residents of St. Vincent who were born in
each census district who were still living
in the district of their birth, and the percentage of the district’s population that
was not foreign-born. Because a district’s level of local mobility was unreDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:44 08 December 2015

Vol. 38, No. 1-2

lated to its emigration rate, the indices
of mobility and stability were not significantly related (r = —0.464, F(1,11) =
3.018, n.s.) and were therefore different
measures of the district’s mobility level.
A district’s stability was not significantly
related to either the ratio of children under five or of children under fifteen to
women of childbearing age (r = —0.415,
F(1,11) = 2.289, n.s.; andr = —0.325,
F(1,11) = 1.299, n.s.).

MULTIPLE CORRELATIONS

In order to test the combined effects
of the independent variables on the ratio
of children under the age of five and the
ratio of children under the age of fifteen
to women of childbearing age, the percentage of the female labor force that
was employed (x) was selected as the
measure of employment most likely to
influence the birth rate, as it was somewhat more closely related to the birth
rate than was the percentage of men
working. Of the educational variables,
the percentage of females in a census
district with more than ten years of education (x2) was chosen. Although the
percentage of men with more than ten
years of education was also closely related to the birth rate, there was a very
high correlation between the two variables (r = 0.978, F(1,11) = 241.781,
p<0.01), making them essentially alternate measures of the same phenomenon. The percentage of households
headed by males (x3) was also included
in the multiple correlation analysis, as
was the percentage of men employed in
agriculture (x4), the port status of the
census district (x5), and both the mobility (x¢) and stability (x7) indices.

When the seven independent variables selected were considered simultaneously in an SPSS-X stepwise regression procedure (see Norusis, 1983, for

 

Child Loss to Migration 107

an explanation of the procedure), only
the percentage of the district’s male
population over the age of fifteen that
was employed in agriculture (x4) was
significantly related to the ratio of children younger than five to women aged
fifteen through forty-four (y,), explaining 53.68 per cent of the variance (7 =
0.733, F(1,11) = 12.745, p< 0.01). For
every percentage point increase in the
percentage of adult men in the district
employed in agriculture, there was an
increase of 0.006 children under five for
each woman of childbearing age.

y1 = 0.006 x, + 0.582 (1)
where

y, = the ratio of children younger than
five to women of childbearing age,
and

X4 = the percentage of adult men in the
district employed in agriculture.

When the seven independent variables were considered against the ratio of
children younger than fifteen to women
aged fifteen through forty-four (y2), the
percentage of men employed in agriculture (x4) entered the procedure first, explaining 53.16 per cent of the variance
(r = 0.729, F(1,11) = 12.482, p<0.01).
Other significant variables were the
port status of the district (xs), its stability index (x7), and the percentage of females in the district aged fifteen and
older who had more than ten years of
education (x2), in that order. Together
these four variables explained 93.81
per cent of the variance in the ratio of
children younger than fifteen to women
of childbearing age (R = 0.969,
F(4,8) = 30.305, p< 0.01). When port
status, the stability index, and the percentage of adult females with more
than ten years of education were
brought into the procedure, however,

108

the percentage of men employed in agriculture (x4) lost its significance and
was dropped, leaving 93.61 per cent of
the variance in the ratio of children
younger than fifteen to women of childbearing age between census districts
explained by a combination of the district’s port status, its stability index,
and the percentage of adult females
with more than ten years of education
R = 0.968, F(3,9) = 43.982, p < 0.01).
The effects of all of the independent
variables, as may be seen in Equation
2, were negative. That is, port districts
had lower child-to-woman ratios than
the others, those districts with greater
population stability had lower child-towoman ratios than did others when the
other variables were controlled, and
those districts with the greatest percentage of adult females with more
than ten years of education had lower
child-to-woman ratios than did others.

The percentage of females in the labor
force who were employed (x;), the percentage of households headed by males
(x3), and the mobility index (x¢) of a district had no significant effect on the ratio
of children younger than fifteen to
women of childbearing age in that district when the other independent variables were controlled. It should be noted
that when population stability was ex
Brittain

 

Social Biology

cluded from consideration the mobility
index became significant, being positively related to the child-woman ratio.
The higher the district’s mobility, the
higher its birth rate when the other variables were controlled. Despite the fact
that the stability index and the mobility
index were not themselves significantly
related, they appear to be alternative
measures of the same phenomenon
when the other variables considered
here are controlled.

The fact that the percentage of adult
men employed in agriculture ceased to
be significantly related to the ratio of
children under the age of fifteen to
women aged fifteen through forty-four
in a district when port status, population
stability, and the percentage of adult females with more than ten years of education were controlled implies that to a
large extent the importance of agriculture in explaining variation in the childto-woman ratio is a function of its relationship to these other variables.
Agriculture itself may be of less importance in keeping the child-to-woman ratio high than are the associated lack of
exposure to new ideas and people, the
high levels of outward mobility associated with agricultural communities, and
the low percentage of women with high
educational attainment.

Because agriculture lost its initial
significance in explaining the ratio of
children younger than fifteen to women
of childbearing age when the other independent variables were controlled, further consideration was given to the determinants of the ratio of children under
the age of five to women of childbearing
age. The percentage of men in a district
employed in agriculture was eliminated
from consideration, and the six remaining independent variables, the percentage of the female labor force working

(x,), the percentage of adult females
with more than ten years of education
(x2), the percentage of households
headed by males (x3), the port status ofa
district (x5), and the mobility (x) and
stability (x7) indices, were considered as
possible determinants. The SPSS-X
stepwise regression procedure identified
the percentage of adult females with
more than ten years of education (x2),
the port status of a district (x5), and the
population stability index (x7), in that
order, as significantly related to a district’s ratio of children younger than five
to women of childbearing age. Together, these three independent variables accounted for 89.44 per cent of the
variance between districts in the childto-woman ratio for children under the
age of five (R = 0.946, F(3,9) = 25.41,
p<0.01), considerably more than the
53.68 per cent of the variance accounted
for by only the percentage of men employed in agriculture. As with the ratio
of children younger than fifteen to
women of childbearing age, the effects
of all of the significant independent variables on the ratio of children younger
than five to women of childbearing age
were negative. Specifically,

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

A number of independent variables
were investigated as possible determinants of the ratios of children younger
than five and of children younger than
fifteen to women aged fifteen through
forty-four in the various census districts
of St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
West Indies. The areas of interest were

Child Loss to Migration 109

employment levels, educational levels,
the percentage of households headed by
men, the percentage of men employed
in agriculture, exposure to outside influences, as measured by the district’s
access to a port or an airport, and the
mobility and stability of the district’s
population.

When the variables were considered
separately, the percentage of women in
the district with more than ten years of
education was negatively related to both
of the child-woman ratios. More educated women apparently had fewer children than those with less education. The
percentage of men employed in agriculture was also an important variable, explaining 53.68 per cent of the variance in
the ratio of children younger than five to
women of childbearing age, and 53.16
per cent of the variance in the ratio of
children younger than fifteen to women
of childbearing age; birth rates were
highest in those districts that depended
most heavily on agriculture. The presence of a port or airport in a district was
also an important correlate of its childto-woman ratios, with port districts having lower ratios than more isolated districts. The employment levels of adults,
percentage of households headed by
males, and mobility and stability indices
had no first-order relationship to either
of the child-woman ratios.

When seven independent variables
were considered together in an SPSS-X
stepwise regression procedure, the ratio
of children younger than five to women
of childbearing age in a district was
significantly related only to the percentage of men in the district who were employed in agriculture. This single variable explained 53.68 per cent of the
variance in the child-to-woman ratio.
The ratio of children younger than
fifteen to women of childbearing age

was also related to the percentage of
men in the district who were engaged in
agriculture, which explained 53.16 per
cent of the variance. Agriculture entered the stepwise regression procedure
first, but was later dropped, as nearly all
of the variance explained by agriculture
was also explained by a complex of the
port status of a district, its stability index, and the percentage of females with
more than ten years of education.

Port districts had lower child-towoman ratios than other districts, as did
those districts that had the highest stability indices and the highest percentage
of females with more than ten years of
education when the other variables were
controlled. Together these three variables accounted for 93.81 per cent of the
variance in the ratio of children younger
than fifteen to women of childbearing
age. Because port status, the stability index, and the percentage of females in a
district with more than ten years of education superceded the percentage of
men employed in agriculture as explanatory variables for the ratio of children
younger than fifteen to women of childbearing age, the percentage of men employed in agriculture was experimentally dropped from the list of
independent variables, and the regression procedure was repeated for the ratio of children younger than five to
women of childbearing age.

When agriculture was eliminated
from consideration, the percentage of
females in a district with more than ten
years of education, the district’s port
status, and its stability index again
emerged as significant explanatory variables, together accounting for 89.44 per
cent of the variance in the child-towoman ratio. As with the ratio of children younger than fifteen to women of
childbearing age, the effect of all of the
independent variables was negative.

 

Social Biology

The stability of a district’s population
contributed significantly to explaining
the district’s ratio of children younger
than fifteen to women of childbearing
age and was also related to the ratio of
children younger than five to women of
childbearing age. Those districts with
the highest stability, that is, a combination of relatively low migration between
districts and low overseas emigration,
had the lowest birth rates when the education levels of the adult women and the
district’s port status were controlled.

Emigration has been seen as a solution to the problem of high birth rates in
many areas, including the East Caribbean. But like mortality, migration reduces the proportion of children born
who can be expected to be a daily help to
elderly parents. Further, if emigrants
can send large remittances to their parents, those parents who can send the
most children overseas have the greatest
chance for ease and comfort in their old
age. It appears that in those districts of
St. Vincent and the Grenadines with the
greatest population stability, parents
did not need, or perhaps want, to have
as many children as in those with higher
levels of local or overseas migration.

High levels of rural-to-urban migration and overseas migration are not
unique to St. Vincent and the Grenadines, nor to the East Caribbean. Massive population movements are characteristic of developing areas today,
particularly where development proceeds unevenly and jobs and amenities
are concentrated in urban centers, or
where improved communication and
transportation have encouraged migration to developed areas across international boundaries. On the basis of evidence from St. Vincent and the
Grenadines, it appears likely that migration has replaced mortality as the leading cause of child loss, and that it may be

that high levels of migration are an important factor in the stalled demographic transition of many developing

areas. Rural birth rates may continue to
