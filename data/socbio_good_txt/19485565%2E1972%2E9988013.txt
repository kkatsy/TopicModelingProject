Preferred Family Constellations:
A Pilot Study

One of the more widely surveyed issues
concerning the mounting population problem is the preferred or ideal size of family.
The most commonly reported figure hovers
around 3.2 children with remarkably minor
differences associated with familial or demographic variables such as race, social class,
and background family size (e.g., see Blake,
1967; Bogue, 1967; Pohlman, 1969).

One weakness common to these studies
is that typically only one type of question
is asked: How many children do you want?
Consequently, while we have knowledge
about an individual’s most preferred size,
we lack information about his ordering of
preferences; nor are we clear about the
relation between sex composition and preferred family size.

In a recent paper, for example, Russo
and Stadler (1971) report traditional attitudes continue to hold regarding family
size, i.e., 84% of their subjects desire from
2 to 4 children. Yet, it is the position here
that parents have boys and girls; that
“children” is a conceptual and mythical
entity which does not exist.

A few studies have concerned themselves
with the desired sexual composition of offspring. Generally, children of both sexes
are wanted with the tendency to prefer

 

boys to girls (e.g., see Dinitz, Dynes, and
Clarke, 1954; Freedman, Freedman, and
Whelpton, 1960; Rainwater, 1965, p. 131;
Sheps, 1963; Weiler, 1959). Suppose individuals were now asked to choose between a
family of three girls or a family of three
boys and two girls, i.e., three children to
five children. In this comparison, would the
factor of size or the factor of sexual balance
prevail? It is this and similar issues which
we propose to explore in this study.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

To assess the relationships stated above,
the Method of Paired Comparisons was
used. In this technique, every stimulus or
item is presented in a pair with every other
item and a judge must indicate which of
each pair represents the greater degree of
the attribute under consideration. From
this, a matrix is generated giving the number or percentage of times each item is
judged to be higher or greater for that
attribute than each other item. Guilford
goes so far as to suggest that the results
might very well serve as the criterion of
validity against which to check any of the
less accurate or less dependable methods of
evaluating (1954, p. 174). Myers and
Roberts (1968) utilized a similar technique

with family makeup, and while laborious
and more time consuming than most other
assessment procedures, it should define precisely the relation among the family constellations.

Recruited as subjects were 25 teachers
taking graduate courses in sex education at
Montclair State College. Of these, 14 were
male and 11, female; their median age was
24. Twelve were single, twelve married,
and one was widowed. Thirteen attended
religious services at least once a month.
Within this group, 24 thought the population explosion a real and important problem; one indicated otherwise. Additionally,
11 teachers were in favor of some kind of
legal restriction on the size of families; 14
were not in favor.

Working with family sizes ranging from
0-5 children, there are 21 possible family
constellations (Table 1). When every con
 

 

Social Biology

stellation is paired with every other one,
210 pairs of constellations are generated.
Both the order of presentation of item
pairs and the constellation order within each
pair were randomized. Among item pairs,
boys preceded girls approximately half the
time. One such item appears as follows:

A. No boys—three girls.
102.
B. Four boys—one girl.

The teachers were instructed to examine
each pair of family constellations and select
the one they preferred. A separate answer
sheet was provided.

Following the questionnaire, a personal
data sheet containing questions about age,
sex, religiosity, etc., was answered. The
scales were answered anonymously and
voluntarily.

RESULTS

If every teacher had always preferred a
particular family constellation to every
other one, that constellation would have
received a perfect mean frequency of 25.
The strongest finding for preferred family
constellation is that sexual balance is
critical (Table 1). The seven most preferred ones contain at least one boy and one
girl (M, H, D, I, L, and R). The seven
least preferred constellations consist of only
boys or only girls (K, B, O, C, P, A, and
U).

When we average out the different constellations of the same size, the most preferred family size is three children (F =
26.33; d.f.= 5,399; p< 0.001). For no
children, X = 5.05; for one child, X =
8.95; two children, X— 15.05; three
children, X = 15.65; four children, X =
13.69; five children, X = 10.78. Hence, we
might describe the relation between size
and preference as being curvilinear. That is,
none or one child families tend not to be

Vol. 19, No. 4

preferred; two, three, or four-child families
tend to be preferred; five-child families
tend not to be preferred.

But this accrues, as we noted, only when
the different constellations of the same size
are averaged out. Even though the most
popular size is three children, the single
most preferred constellation is two boys
and two girls (Table 1). Obviously, what
people want is a three-child family consisting of two boys and two girls.

The paradox is only apparent. We indicated teachers prefer sexual balance in their
families. Overall, the four-child family generates various constellations of greater
imbalance than the three-child family. However, the four-child family can generate one
perfectly balanced constellation (two boys
and two girls) while no three-child family
can achieve this.

In short, the variable of sex balance
clearly limits the breadth of the generalization that two, three, or four children are
the most preferred family sizes, As shown
in Table 1, both R and S (three boys—
two girls and two boys—three girls) , which
are five-child families, tended to be ranked
more preferably than constellations E, F,
G, J, K, N, and O, all of which represent
families of two, three, or four children.
Constellation B, a one-child family, was
ranked higher than constellations K and O,
which are four-child families.

Direct statistical tests support this. For
example, when R and S are compared to O,
we find, respectively, 80% (x7 = 9.00;
d.f. = 1; p < 0.01) and 84% (y? = 11.42;
d.f.==1; < 0.001) preferring these fivechild constellations to the four-child constellation of only four girls. Similarly, 80%
(x? = 9.00; df.=1; 2 < 0.01) and 72%
(x? = 4.84; d.f. = 1; » < 0.05) prefer, respectively, R and S to K, which has only
four boys.

It is also clear that there exists strong

403

differences in preference to different constellations of the same size. For example,
two boys and two girls (M) are ranked
first but no boys and four girls (O) are
ranked seventeeth.

The data confirm previous findings: boys
are more desired than girls, and this holds
for every appropriate comparison. For example, as seen in Table 1, two boys—one
girl (H) is preferred to two girls—one boy

(I).

DISCUSSION

Even within the confines of a relatively
small and homogeneous sample, the study
has provided data which are highly suggestive of the pattern of preferences. When
the different constellations of the same size
are averaged out, support is found for the
traditional contention that the most preferred size is three with decreasing preference as one moves away from this point.
However, the data are just as compelling
in showing that this generalization must be
tempered. Within the range of family sizes
studied, sexual balance becomes so critical
that certain five-child constellations are
preferred to certain two, three, and fourchild constellations.

While future studies should explore the
scope of these exceptions, notice is served
that the mode of asking a question must be
considered carefully. For example, in a
national fertility study (Institute for
Survey Research, 1970), two questions are
asked. First, “What do you think is the
ideal size of a family—a husband, a wife,
and how many children?” (Q. 1, p. 1), and
second “How many of these should be boys
and how many girls?” (Q. 2, p. 1). By
asking the “ideal size” first, one necessarily
fixes the sexual composition for the response
to the second question. Yet, as we have
seen, preferred number of children and
preferred number of boys and girls are not

synonymous variables and may obtain different numbers of children. Hence, there
exists good reason to drop the number of
children question altogether. As noted by
Myers and Roberts (1968):

When a woman responds to a conventional

question on ideal family size, we can specu
late on what composition she may be using
as a context for her response. From these
data, it is clear that the sex combinations

are extremely critical. (p. 169)

Most intriguing are the data yielding
individual differences and exceptions. Overall, M is the most preferred constellation
and U, the least preferred. Nevertheless, at
least one teacher prefers no boys and five
girls (U) to two boys and two girls (M).
Similarly, at least three teachers would
rather have five boys and no girls (P) to
two boys and two girls (M). Interestingly,
at least one teacher would rather have five
girls and no boys to four girls and no boys.
If one assumes that response or clerical
error does no account for these exceptions,
then a deviant case analysis can probably
reveal good insights into the dynamics of
family planning.

As noted, the sample consisted of only
25 teachers so that one hesitates in
making inferences to other populations.
Nevertheless, the data do not vary that
strongly from those reported by Myers and
Roberts (1968) who worked with Puerto
Rican mothers. The procedure is lengthy
and working with a six-child family could

make extensive assessment impossible. The
data, however, do point to possible avenues
of research.
