ABSTRACT: The epidemiological features of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) were examined among
American Indians in the southwestern United States. All FAS suspects were screened in specific populations of Navajo, Pueblo, and Plains culture tribes. A total of 115 alcohol-affected children were
identified. The incidence of FAS was found to be highly variable from one cultural group to the next,
ranging from 1.3 per 1,000 births (1/749) for the Navajo to 10.3 (1/97) for the Plains. The pattern of
age-specific prevalence indicates an increase over the past fifteen years. The overall rate of mothers
who have produced fetal alcohol children was 6.1 per 1,000 women of childbearing age with a range of
4 to 33 per 1,000. These maternal prevalence rates were important for the accurate prediction of
public health risk because 25 per cent of all mothers who had produced one affected child had also
produced others. The average per mother was 1.3 alcohol-affected children. Other findings indicate
that the mothers of these children led highly disruptive and chaotic lives and were frequently isolated
from mainstream social activities. In general, the gross social and cultural patterns of the tribes stud
ied can readily explain the variation in incidence of FAS.

In 1979, the International Year of the
Child, the Indian Children’s Program of
the Indian Health Service (IHS) convened an expert committee to select a
public health project of major importance to Indian children. This group decided to establish a Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) Project for two reasons.
First, those with extensive clinical experience among Indians perceived FAS as
a new and increasing problem among
Southwestern tribes. Second, the early
FAS literature had already identified
some American Indian children with
FAS (Smith et al., 1976).

The resulting FAS Demonstration
Project had three goals. First, the program was to provide education and
training in the recognition and prevention of FAS for health care providers,
human services workers, and local community groups. Second, the program

was to offer evaluation by a pediatric
dysmorphologist to all FAS suspects and
initiate a treatment plan for children
with FAS and other developmental
problems. Third, research was to be undertaken to assess the incidence of FAS
among American Indians. The complete project is described in detail elsewhere (May and Hymbaugh, 1983).
This paper will focus on the third goal.
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome refers to a
pattern of malformations found in children whose mothers drank alcohol excessively during pregnancy. The most
common features are: varying degrees
of mental retardation and CNS dysfunction, reduced birth length and weight, microcephaly, hypoplastic midface,
growth deficiency throughout life, certain joint abnormalities, frequent cardiac defects, and hyperactivity (Jones et
al., 1973; Jones and Smith, 1976; Rosett

et al., 1976; Streissguth et al., 1980) Recently, it has been recognized that moderate and/or binge drinking may cause
less severe forms of developmental
damage. Thus, the teratogenic effect of
alcohol can be conceptualized as a spectrum. Heavy drinking may result in the
complete FAS, whereas lower levels of
consumption may cause lesser mental
and growth defects (Rosett, 1974, 1976;
Streissguth et al., 1978; Eckardt et al.,
1981).

In the U.S. and Europe, FAS isa frequently documented birth defect. Although several hundred clinical and experimental studies of FAS among
humans and animals have been published, the epidemiology of FAS has not
been well characterized. Data are currently available only for Seattle, Washington (Streissguth et al., 1980), Goteberg, Sweden (Olegard et al., 1979),
and Roubaix, France (Dehaene et al.,
1977, 1981). Estimates of the incidence
of FAS vary from 1 in every 600 babies
in Sweden and 1 in 700 in France, to 1 in
750 in Seattle. Fetal Alcohol Effect
(FAE), a milder form of in-utero damage, has been reported in France and
Sweden with an incidence approximately equal to that of FAS. Each of the
above rates is based on cumulative clinical experience and not on a survey of a
specific population. FAS documentation is currently not available in large
national data bases (Eckhardt et al.,
1981) and probably will not be in the
near future. The present study is therefore unique in determining the magnitude of FAS in a defined population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

INDIAN Groups STUDIED

The Indians of this study are from
three very different cultural and social

Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

 

375

traditions. The Pueblo Indians have inhabited the southwestern United States
for 10,000 years or more. Their traditions emphasize sedentary, pastoral,
and agricultural pursuits, and their social integration 1s matrilineal, complex,
and strongly ‘emphasizes conformity
with the larger (community based)
group” (Dozier, 1970).

The Apache and the Ute tribes are
the Plains culture groups in this study.
These tribes migrated to the Southwest
approximately 1,000 years ago. The nomadic, hunting, gathering, and raiding
tradition of their culture is in many ways
a polar opposite to the Pueblo. In Plains
culture tribes, individuality is encouraged and some flamboyant behaviors
such as risk-taking, drinking, and
defiance are tolerated and may be encouraged. The largest permanent level
of Plains social organization was traditionally a band of several allied extended families (Schroeder, 1974).

The Navajo cultural traditions are a
mixture of the Pueblo and Plains traditions. The Navajo came from the same
Plains traditions as the Apache, but in
the past three hundred years they have
adopted many traits of the Pueblo.
Therefore, the Navajo patterns of social
integration and behavior regulation are
intermediate between the Plains and
Pueblo. The Navajo emphasize conformity to group norms, but allow more
individualized behavior than the Pueblo
(Kluckholn and Leighton, 1962).

The contemporary socioeconomic
status of southwestern Indians shows
some variation within each culture, for
the individual tribal cultures are in various stages of modernization and transition (Kunitz and Levy, 1981). Many
young Indians are upwardly mobile due
to recent educational and economic opportunities, but the majority of the indi

viduals and tribes are characterized by
low education and limited economic development. Nevertheless, the overall
differences in social integration still exist
and influence behavior as evidenced by
alcohol-related mortality statistics. The
Plains tribes have consistently higher
death rates from flamboyant behaviors
such as accidents, suicide, and homicide
(U.S. Public Health Service, 1978,
1979; VanWinkle, 1981; Reidy, 1982)

In sum, the three cultural traditions
of these tribes generally produce different types of behavior (May, 1982). Particularly, their differing alcohol-related
behaviors must be considered in evaluating the epidemiology of FAS.

METHODOLOGY

The study was undertaken in 1980-82
among American Indians of New Mexico, Southern Colorado, Southern
Utah, and Northern Arizona. Indian
groups served by the project resided on
26 reservations with a total population
in 1980 of approximately 240,000 (U.S.
Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1979). Because the land area
served was vast, transportation and logistics were major obstacles and determinants of the study design.

An elaborate referral system served
as the basis for this study. All research
activities were coordinated on each of
the outlying reservations from the central office in Albuquerque. The major
focal point on each reservation was one
of the eleven hospitals or ten full-time
clinics operated by the IHS. At each of
these installations, explicit and detailed
training on the recognition and diagnosis of FAS was provided to all IHS clinical staff by the project staff and two consultant dysmorphologists. These diag

nostic training sessions were two-hour
slide and data presentations detailing
the clinical characteristics of 15 FAS and
FAE children from birth to 17 years of
age. Further literature on FAS was subsequently provided to trainees. In each
session the FAS Demonstration Project
was explained, with specific instructions
concerning referral of suspected FAS
children. To complement the training
and facilitate referral, all physicians and
nurses trained were provided with a
three-page referral form for FAS suspects. Items included on this form were
key aspects of the parents’ medical and
alcohol use histories; birth length,
weight, and head circumference of the
suspect, and a simple checklist of 29
characteristics generally found in FAS.
In addition, the referring clinicians were
asked to attach growth charts, developmental test results, and other relevant
information.

At each clinic or hospital one or two
“designated persons” were the major liaisons with the project. The project staff
at the central office worked closely with
local staff to review and verify the records of the referred child and of his/her
parents. Referrals were encouraged for
any child considered suspicious because
of clinical features of FAS and a maternal history of drinking. The primary emphasis in ascertainment was on children
under 15 years of age. FAS suspects
were then scheduled for clinics at the
health installation from which they were
referred. The project staff and one or
more of the project dysmorphologists
traveled to the outlying clinic where
data collection and diagnostic evaluations were completed.

To standardize the final diagnosis, a
weighted diagnostic form was developed for the project by a committee of

seven experienced dysmorphologists.
The form consisted of 36 separate diagnostic items divided into four sections:
drinking history, radiologic findings,
growth and development, and clinical
observations. The section on clinical observations contained eleven subsections: general observations, lateral facial profile, ear, eye, nose, neck, chest,
arms, and hands, heart, back, and skin.

Screened children were categorized

= for project purposes as FAS, FAE, sus
picious, or without signs of fetal alcohol
damage. Two diagnostic categories,
FAS and FAE, were used for definite alcohol damage. For the diagnosis of
FAS, all of the following were required:
(1) prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency; (2) mental deficit and development delay; (3) facial dysmorphia; (4)
physical abnormalities; and (5) documentation of alcohol abuse during pregnancy. FAE designated a milder form of
prenatal alcohol damage with the child
having all of the features of FAS, but to
a lesser degree. A diagnosis of “‘suspicious” indicated that the child met many
of the criteria of FAE, except for adequate evidence of abusive maternal
drinking. Without exception, all diagnoses were made by two dysmorphologists, who both have considerable experience with FAS and American Indians.
The major orientation for the diagnosis
was toward future therapy and habilitation of the child (May and Hymbaugh,
1983).

Alcohol histories of the mothers and
some fathers were obtained from multiple sources. In most cases, adequate
documentation was available in medical
charts through notes and visits for
alcohol-related illness and trauma. Records of local and tribal police, and social
welfare agencies were also consulted.

Additional informants, such as clinic
and field health personnel, relatives,
friends, and social service workers
were used to further substantiate the
history. A strict quantitative definition
of alcohol abuse was not possible. Verification was assumed when all sources
were in complete agreement that alcohol abuse was common during pregnancy. Since most of these reservations
were quite small and of restrictive residence, these informants were quite
aware of the drinking patterns of the
mothers.

Population data used in the analysis
were derived from Indian Health Service estimates. These estimates were
based on 1970 U.S. census data, actual
Indian births and deaths, and net county
migration (U.S. Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1979) They were
the latest available figures which were
age- and community-specific.

Two different rates were calculated
to describe the occurrence of FAS and
FAE. Prevalence rates for children ages
0-14 were calculated with 1979 population estimates as the denominators. To
approximate the incidence of FAS and
FAE at birth, the actual natality was reconstructed by combining the 1979 population estimates and mortality experience from life tables.1 The Navajo data
were corrected with a tribe-specific life
table (Carr and Lee, 1978), whereas the
Pueblo and Plains figures were adjusted
with a life table for all U.S. Indians (Indian Health Service, 1975). The incidence was then calculated as the ratio of

‘It would have been preferable to use actual
births for the denominator, but this was not possible because tribal affiliation is not recorded on
birth certificates and because of the IHS system of
aggregating birth date.

the total number of cases to the total
number of births.

The prevalence of mothers who had
produced an FAS or FAE child was also
calculated. The denominators for these
rates were the 1974 estimates of women
aged 15-44 years. Since the children
ages 0-14 in 1980 were born between
1967 and 1981, 1974 is the midpoint
year.

Overall rates in each table were calculated for the entire population covered by the FAS project in the Southwest. These rates were adjusted by the
direct method with weights proportional
to the representation of each culture in
the entire study area.

In the results section data are presented for individual reservations and
service units. The specific reservations
and tribes are not named to avoid stigmatization. Therefore, the results are
reported in a way that cites important
identifying cultural information, but
pseudonyms are used for the particular
subtribes, reservations, or areas studied.

RESULTS |

The FAS project held 23 clinics in six
teen different locations. Of the 243 chil
dren evaluated, 31.3 per cent-had FAS,
16.0 per cent had FAE, and 5.3 per cent

were considered suspicious (Table 1).
Among the 47.4 per cent diagnosed as
not having FAS, most were diagnosed
as normal. Other specific anomalies
were found in 12 per cent of the children
examined, including hypoparathyroidism, blepharophimosis and Down,
Melnick-Needles, Fetal Hydantoin,
Noonan, and Cornelia deLange syndromes.

The average birth measurements of
the diagnosed children were consonant
with FAS in other populations when
compared with standard growth charts.
Indian FAS children were small at birth
in length (mean=17.3 inches, predicted=20), weight (mean=4.6 lbs.,
predicted=7.5), and head circumference (mean=12.2 inches, predicted = 13.6) (National Center for
Health Statistics, 1976). Other studies
have shown that normal Southwest Indian babies are heavier and longer at
birth (Adams and Niswander, 1968),
than those of other U.S. populations.
Growth patterns for the first two or
three years of a child’s life were particularly important in diagnosing this condition. Some of the children diagnosed as
having fetal alcohol effect were “low
normal” (e.g., 10th percentile) at birth
on standard growth charts, but their
growth curves showed inadequate

growth, resulting in a marked “flattening” of the curve and a decline in percentile rank in their first few years.

The detailed epidemiological analyses which follow were limited to the
seven service units and reservations
where ascertainment was judged to be
complete by project staff and local
health personnel (Table 2). The fertility
rates-of these tribes during the past
fifteen years were comparable and the
age structures of these different reservation populations were similar. In these
areas there were 55 FAS children and 30
FAE children (aged 0-14) among a total
1979 population of 51,137 of which
22,963 were aged 0-14. Four alcoholaffected children 15 years or older were
also found. The Plains groups have the

incidence among the Plains tribes exceeds the upper range of any previously
reported rates, but the overall culture
adjusted rates are quite similar to pre

rates were lower in the older ages (Table

One unanticipated finding in this research was the frequent occurrence of
two or more alcohol-damaged children
born to one mother (Table 4). On the

FAS or FAE children were born to 65
mothers, an average of 1.3 affected children per mother. Fifteen mothers produced more than one damaged child,
among them one set of twins (dizygotic).
Variation in the pattern of recurrent affected births were found between tribal

The prevalence of mothers with damaged offspring was lowest among the

Social Biology

Pueblo and Navajo, and much higher
among the Plains tribes (Table 4). These
rates are useful in measuring the extent
and origin of risk in each population.
Social maladjustment, high-risk lifestyles, and high mean maternal age at
birth of the damaged children were
characteristic of the mothers in this
study (Table 5). Of the fetal alcohol children, 73 per cent were adopted or in foster placement. In most cases, the child
had been left with relatives or friends,
abandoned, or other neglect was documented. In 23 per cent of the cases, the
mother was dead, almost always from
accidents, cirrhosis of the liver, or other
alcohol-related trauma and illness.
There was variation by culture, with the
lowest mortality in the Navajo and the
highest in the Plains. The screening
process used could have increased the
proportions of deceased mothers and
children in foster placement, if foster
parents were more likely to have their

children evaluated. Mothers bearing
FAS and FAE children had a mean age
at delivery of 29.7, higher than that of
the mothers of the non-FAS children
seen and higher than the mean age at delivery for all Navajo mothers (24.8)
(Broudy and May, 1983). Of all of the
mothers who produced FAS and FAE
children, only 18 per cent were under
the age of 25.

DISCUSSION

A referral network and clinical
screening system were used to identify
prevalent cases of FAS and FAE in
southwestern American Indian groups.
This approach was determined largely
by feasibility issues and may have limitations for the epidemiological analyses of
this paper. First, the adequacy of casefinding cannot be independently verified. Accordingly, we limited the calculation of prevalence and incidence to
the populations where screening was
known to be satisfactory. The resulting

tates (Table 2) were comparable to or
higher than those from other populations (Streissguth et al., 1980; Olegard
et al., 1979; Dehaene et al., 1981); thus,
bias from incomplete ascertainment appears unlikely. Second, alcohol histories
were not obtained directly from the
mothers. However, the combination of
medical records and community informants was generally sufficiently sensitive
to identify abusive drinking during pregnancy. Third, calculation of incidence
rates for FAS and FAE required a pragmatic reconstruction of birth numbers.
This approach also assumes no deaths
among children with FAS and FAE and,
as a result, probably underestimates the
actual incidence. Fourth, a similarly
pragmatic technique was used to calculate the prevalence of mothers who had
given birth to an FAS or FAE child (Table 4). Mid-point population figures
were used to estimate the numbers of
women at risk for giving birth to an alcohol damaged child. Although this approach is relatively crude, the prevalence estimates should provide a

382

satisfactory measure of inter-tribal variation.

With these limitations in mind, the
incidence of FAS among Southwestern
Indians can be compared to previously
reported rates. The Navajo rate (1 per
690 births) and overall rate for Southwest Indians (1 per 633) are lower than
that reported for Seattle (1 per 750) and
fall between the rates for Roubaix,
France (1 per 700) and Goteberg, Sweden (1 per 600). The Pueblo rate of 1 per
495 is higher than those for all the comparison populations. The Plains incidence of 1 per 102 births is much higher
than any previous figures reported. The
overall incidence of FAS and FAE
found among Southwest Indians, 1 per
427, is quite comparable to the estimates
from France and Sweden, although the
criteria used in this study may be more
strict than those used in Europe.?

The age-specific rates (Table 3) raise
three interesting thoughts. First, the literal interpretation is that the occurrence
of FAS and FAE is increasing among
the groups, especially among the
Navajo and Pueblo. Second, the screening process might have been effective in
identifying younger children. Third, fetal alcohol children may have unusually
high mortality experience in their early
years.

Attention can now be turned to possible explanations for the variability in
occurrence of FAS in the three American Indian populations studied. Among
the possible explanations for this disparity are innate biological differences
among the groups, either in the liability
for prenatal alcohol damage or in the

metabolism of ethanol itself, differences
in the teratogenic agent, or sociocultural
differences among the tribes studied.

BIOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS

While a number of studies in the past
have attempted to show differences between Indians and Caucasians in the
rate or extent of alcohol breakdown, no
convincing differences have been substantiated. The common stereotype of
the “drunken Indian” has not been
borne out either in terms of aberrant
metabolism of alcohol (Reed et al.,
1976; Schaeffer, 1981), liver biopsies
(Bennion and Li, 1976), or in the proportion of the Indian population abusive
of alcohol (May, 1982). Furthermore,
there is no evidence for a genetic component in production of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, for the type and severity
of its manifestations are identical in Indian and non-Indian children (Aase,
1981). While it would be premature to
rule out innate metabolic differences of
a subtle kind, or the presence of some
environmental or genetic cofactors
which influence the occurrence of FAS,
there is presently no valid information
which points in this direction (Schaefer,
1981).

SUBSTRATE DIFFERENCES

Conceivably, there might be some ingredient in the different alcoholic beverages consumed by different groups
which might account for different risks
for FAS in offspring of alcoholic
women. In previous surveys, the type of
beverage consumed had no discernible
influence either on the incidence or the
severity of FAS in children of drinking
mothers. Total alcohol intake seems to
correlate best with these outcomes
(Iber, 1980), but even this seems to be

variable, since more than half of the offspring of severely alcoholic women
seem to be protected from the effects of
maternal alcohol abuse (Jones and
Smith, 1976; Rosett et al., 1976;
Streissguth et al., 1980). In our study,
the usual variety of alcoholic beverages
was consumed both by mothers of affected and unaffected children. Also, alcohol is definitely the drug of choice
among the adults of the study population (May, 1982; Levy and Kunitz,
1974).

SOCIOCULTURAL FACTORS

For the purposes of this discussion,
sociocultural factors can be viewed as
creating expectations which either foster or inhibit individual drinking behavior and also influence the style of consumption. In considering maternal
drinking patterns, four considerations
need attention: rate, severity, and duration of alcoho] abuse in wqmen of childbearing age, and the timing of alcohol
intake in relation to the gestation in
question.

National surveys indicate that 60 per
cent of all U.S. women consume some
alcohol (National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism, 1981), while
surveys among the Navajo and Plains
tribes show that only 13 to 55 per cent of
women drink (Levy and Kunitz, 1974;
Longclaws et al., 1980; Whittaker, 1962,
1982). Certain subsegments within each
tribe, however, have significant alcohol
abuse problems as evidenced by high
rates of death from accidents, liver cirrhosis, and other alcohol related causes
(US. Public Health Service, 1978, 1979)
among Indian men and women

(Streissguth, 1980).
In these groups, certain distinct social
factors may have a profound influence

Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

383

on the severity of alcohol abuse in
women and the resulting incidence of
FAS and FAE. While the per cent of
population drinking within each tribe influences the findings, drinking style is
more relevant to severity of abuse. For
example, the highest percentage of
drinking women is found among the
Plains tribes (50-55%; Whitaker, 1962,
1982), with considerably lower percentages among the Pueblo and Navajo (1323%; Levy and Kunitz, 1974). As expected, the Plains tribes had the highest
incidence of fetal alcohol damage. However, the Plains rate of FAS and FAE
(in Table 2) is five (4.9) to seven (7.0)
times higher than the other tribes, much
higher than would be dictated solely by
the proportion of drinkers. This is due to
the normative pattern of social regulation. The Plains tribes allow for considerably more individuation of behavior,
especially alcohol-abusive behavior
(Jessor et al., 1968; Curley, 1967). More
Plains women are permitted to follow
abusive behaviors, while the low incidence rates of the Pueblo and Navajo
exemplify tighter control exercised on
individuation and alcohol abuse. Bearing an alcohol-damaged baby is not condoned in the mainstream of any of these
tribal groups, but it is more common
with the loose social integration of the
Plains groups.

Social variables can also influence
drinking severity and FAS in some special circumstances. An example from
our study clearly demonstrated that alcohol abuse rates can be atypically high
at certain times which clearly puts more
pregnancies at risk. One small Plains
reservation (reservation N) with a high
incidence of fetal alcohol problems had
received royalties for a number of years
from the sale of resources extracted

384

from their lands. Payments of approximately $100 per month were distributed
to adult tribal members on a per capita
basis. For various reasons, the tribe suspended the payments in the late 1970's,
and the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome appears to have decreased dramatically (Table 3). Of the fourteen Fetal Alcohol children found on this
reservation under the age of 15, only
one FAE child had been born after the
cessation of per capita payments.

Ostracism from a tribal culture may
also affect the severity of alcohol abuse.
As in most areas of the United States,
female Indian adolescents usually experiment with alcohol, but as they grow
into their twenties, societal rules become more strictly enforced. Among
the Plains tribes more variation in drinking behavior 1s afforded women, but
among the Navajo and Pueblo a woman
who continues drinking is much less
likely to be tolerated or accepted, especially among the Pueblo. More clearly
than in many societies, traditional
Pueblo or Navajo people enforce a
definite choice on most of their
women—to abstain or to be partially or
totally ostracized. Those who continue
regular or heavy drinking are removed
from participation in most family and
tribal activities. Once this occurs, stigmatization fixes their alcoholic life style
and promotes increased severity of
abuse.

Informants consistently reported the
ostracism pattern for mothers who produced two or more children with fetal alcohol damage. They were often characterized as unreachable and far removed
from mainstream tribal society. We postulate that ostracism maintains the severity and duration of abusive drinking
and thus may explain the birth of multi

ple affected children to a single mother
and also the higher rate of FAS among
the Pueblo than among the Navajo.
Support for this hypothesis is the ratio of
FAS to FAE. The ratio ts very different
between tribes (Table 4). In the Plains
groups there are as many FAE children
produced as FAS (approximately 1 to
1), while among the Navajo and Pueblo
the ratio is approximately 2 to 1 and 4 to
1 respectively. This variation is consistent with the anticipated effects of ostracism and drinking behavior, since the
Pueblo exercise the strongest ostracism
and the Plains the weakest.

Ostracism may also prolong the duration of alcohol abuse. Among American
Indian groups, the period of childbearing 1s longer than that of the general
population (Broudy and May, 1983).
The combination of sustained alcohol
abuse and this prolongation of childbearing years increases the risk for FAS.
In this study a pattern of successively
more severely affected offspring was repeatedly observed. Among the women
who produced more than one fetal alcohol child, the later children always were
diagnosed as having equal (47 per cent)
or more severe damage (53 per cent).
Therefore, as long as a mother continued to drink, the degree of severity of
symptoms increased with each succeeding child. However, several cases indicated that if a mother quit drinking in
subsequent pregnancies, normal children were born.

CONCLUSIONS

The ascertainment method used in
this study employed several successive
levels of screening for children suspected of having Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. This technique, with a weighted
 

 

Vol. 30, No. 4

checklist of FAS characteristics used in
the final screening, was quite costeffective and yielded reliable prevalence
figures for the three American Indian
groups surveyed. While not a guarantee
of 100 per cent ascertainment, this approach may prove useful in further epidemiologic studies of FAS and other
teratogenic conditions in limited populations to permit assessment of risk and

cation and intervention efforts can be
targeted with greater effectiveness once
these factors have been determined, and
existing social constraints might be
turned to positive uses in supporting efforts at alcohol abstinence in pregnant
women, During the course of the study,
it became evident that the issue of fetal
alcohol damage gained widespread and
enthusiastic interest among health
workers and the general population
(May and Hymbaugh, 1983), in contrast
to the indifferent response often generated by approaches to other alcoholrelated problems. Since the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is the most common
severe birth defect in the groups surveyed, any potential preventive measures hold promise for a significant reduction in the tremendous social,
financial, and personal burdens caused
by this disorder.
