ABSTRACT: A sample of 94 children with low birthweights (LBW < 2500 grams) was identified
in a group of 857 children who took part in an 18-year follow-up study of the Danish Prospective
Perinatal Cohort. The LBW group was compared with the rest of the sample on a set of longterm intellectual and psychosocial outcomes. In addition, the relative predictive power of low
birthweight and a set of environmental variables regressed on two adolescent academic outcomes was examined. No significant residual or complicating effects of LBW were found on any
outcomes after 18 years. However, full-birthweight adolescents possessed differential characteristics with respect to the pattern of correlated environmental variables. LBW adolescents
appear to have a greater sensitivity to environmental influences. For males, stability of adult
figures and general order and structure are more conducive to an optimal] outcome; for females,
the strongest predictor was level of maternal psychological adaptation or general contentment.

Drillien (1964), in an early attempt to
describe maternal characteristics, studied a variable she called ‘maternal efficiency.” This variable was comprised
of aspects of the maternal care received
by the child. Drillien related maternal
efficiency to the incidence of accidents
and illness in a sample of premature subjects; but she did not analyze it in relation to academic outcomes. Nevertheless, Drillien recognized the significance
of the mother’s ability to effectively organize the child’s environment in relation to the child’s physical development.
Mother’s IQ, which may be related to
maternal efficiency, has also been
shown to influence long-term negative
consequences in LBW infants (Werner
et al., 1971). Werner and her colleagues
further observed that the stability of the
home constituted an additional significant interactive agent.

More recently, researchers from the
Infant Studies Project at the University
of California, Los Angeles (Beckwith
and Cohen, 1984; Beckwith et al., 1976;
Sigman et al., 1981), have hypothesized
that the mediating link between early
medical and neurological events and
later competencies in their pre-term
subjects is the nature of the interaction
between infant and caregiver. Sigman et
al. (1981) concluded that the importance of environmental factors supercedes that of early medical events, and
further, that these factors are more influential for females than for males.

It is clear that variables such as maternal efficiency or orderliness, amount
and quality of caregiver-infant interaction, and stability of the family are correlated with socioeconomic status
(Bronfenbrenner, 1979, and others).

tention paid to young children becomes
increasingly difficult. Itis, however, also
clear that many mothers from lower social classes do have the resources and
the ability necessary for maintaining stable conditions in the home despite economic hardship (Baker and Mednick,
1984). One purpose of the inguiry reported here is to determine the influence
of a set of maternal and home descriptor
variables that may function somewhat
independently of SES. Since in many instances such variables are more amenable to manipulation or change than SES,
the analyses reported here may result in
heuristics useful in the design of treatment variables and intervention strategies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The analyses reported in this paper
were completed as a part of an 18-year
follow-up study of a group of 857 children who took part in a Danish prospective perinatal study. Children with low
birthweight (LBW=<< 2500 grams)
were compared with the remainder of
the follow-up sample born at normal or
full birthweight (FBW) on a set of longterm intellectual and psychosocial outcome variables. In addition, the notion
that LBW children are more sensitive to
environmental stress was examined using two outcome variables defined in
terms of overall adjustment to and academic success in school. The predictive
power of a set of environmental variables in relation to these outcomes was
determined for the LBW group and was
subsequently compared with the predictive power of the same variables for the
full sample. Thus, this paper represents
an attempt to follow a group of LBW
children to late adolescence to determine whether or not there are any resid

to be found after 18 years. The paper
also attempts to provide further clarification of the nature and persistence
over time of the specific sensitivity of
LBW children to defined environmental
variables. The value of this type of analysis rests in its potential contribution to
the design of preventive and facilitative
intervention strategies.

Two previously published papers that
used a sample drawn from the Danish
Prospective Perinatal Study had a direct
influence on the design of the inquiry reported in this paper. Using a subsample
(N = 349) drawn from the perinatal
study, Zachau-Christiansen (1979)
found 12-year-olds who were LBW infants to have experienced more academic and intellectual problems than
their full-birthweight classmates. However, in a reanalysis of the same data,
Zachau-Christiansen and Mednick
(1981) significantly modified the 1979
findings. It was pointed out in the 1981
paper that the 349 LBW subjects originally analyzed by Zachau-Christiansen
represented a significantly lower SES
distribution than the comparison group
of full-birthweight classmates. Low SES
in other studies has been found to be
strongly associated with both poor academic achievement and intellectual
problems (Broman et al., 1975; Caputo
et al., 1981; Sameroff and Chandler,
1975; Sameroff, 1981). Similarly, a
strong association between low SES and
poor intellectual performance was also
observed in the data reported in the
1979 paper. Thus, in the 1981 reanalysis
Zachau-Christiansen and Mednick concluded that the 1979 findings presented
an exaggerated estimate of the influence
of LBW on the functioning of 12-yearolds. As a matter of fact, the 1981 analy

sis confirmed the finding of a strong interaction of LBW with low SES in the
development of long-term intellectual
and academic deficiencies.

Although the present study also used
subjects from the Danish Perinatal
Study, the sample selection differed
from the 1979 study in two important
ways: (1) Both LBW and comparison
subjects were drawn from the Perinatal
Sample, and (2) the SES distribution of

SUBJECTS

The 857 mother-infant dyads sam‘z pled were randomly drawn from a Dan2 ish birth cohort consisting of all births
© that took place at the University Hospital in Copenhagen (Righospitalet) between September 1959 and December
1961. The total birth cohort consisted of
9,125 deliveries who served as subjects
in a Danish prospective longitudinal
project aimed at investigating the relationship between pre- and perinatal factors and children’s later health and development. The purpose and procedures of the Danish Perinatal Project

oaded by

Low-birthweight Adolescents 97

have been described in detail in previous
publications (Baker and Mednick, 1984;
Zachau-Christiansen and Ross, 1975).
Of the 857 subjects who took part in the
18-year follow-up study, 94 lowbirthweight infants (<2500 grams) had
full data sets related to all of the variables; similarly, a total of 701 fullbirthweight infants had full data sets.

The 795 subjects included in these
analyses represent the whole range of
the SES distribution, but have a slightly
lower mean SES in comparison to relevant Danish population statistics. In addition, the sample includes a larger proportion of subjects whose mothers were
teenagers and/or unmarried at the time
of birth. This is due to a policy which was
in effect during the data collection
years. At that time all unmarried mothers from the Copenhagen metropolitan
area were referred to the University
Hospital for pre- and neonatal care. The
reason for the disproportionately large
number of LBW children found in the
follow-up sample (approximately 12 per
cent) is again related to the special admission policies of the University Hospital during the years in question. At that
time, women from the entire Copenhagen area with histories of LBW deliveries or with complications in the
present pregnancy were referred to this
hospital. The majority of the LBW infants were also born prematurely, although some subjects were full-term
and small for gestational age (Lubchenco, 1976).

DaTA COLLECTION

Current addresses of the subjects
were obtained from the Danish Population Register for purposes of the followup. The mothers of the subjects were
contacted initially by an experienced

98 Baker et al.

clinical social worker who explained the
goals of the project and encouraged
them to take part.

Through a carefully constructed interview protocol the mothers were queried in their homes about the family environment and about life history and
characteristics of the index child. These
interviews lasted approximately two
hours and were performed by social
workers who had undergone intensive
training in the administration of the interview and the coding of the responses.
During the interview, permission was
requested by the social worker to contact a subset of the children’s schools
and obtain information from the teachers concerning the academic and psychosocial adjustment of the subjects.
When the school was contacted, the
teacher who had had the greatest
amount of contact was asked to complete a detailed questionnaire. Teacher
questionnaires were completed for 331
of the 795 students. Comparisons between these subjects and those for
whom no teacher data was collected
showed no differences in terms of social
and maternal characteristics at the time
of the index child’s birth or at follow-up.
Thus, generalization of reported findings based on the 331 subjects to the total sample of 795 seems warranted. Similar comparisons were made within the
LBW and FBW groups to determine if
there were differences between those
with teacher ratings (LBW =51;
FBW = 280) and without teacher ratings (LBW = 43; FBW = 421). No differences were found.

DESCRIPTION OF THE OUTCOME
VARIABLES

Scales Derived from the Mother
Interview.—Two scales derived from
the mother’s interview relate to the

Social Biology

mother’s perception of the child’s performance and adjustment in school.
Both mother interview scales were first
identified in an exploratory factor analysis of the original items. The first scale,
Child’s Academic Performance, consisted of the mother’s ratings of the
child’s performance on an array of cognitive activities (e.g., reading) on a 3point scale. The Academic Performance
scale had an alpha reliability of 0.77.
The second scale, Child’s Schoo! Problems, was derived from a “problems”
factor that included moderately high
loadings for a fairly heterogenous set of
perceptions, for example, that the child
had repeated a grade and had been
given individual remedial tutoring. This

scale yielded an alpha reliability of 0.52.

These data were available for the total
follow-up sample (LBW =94;
FBW = 701).

Scales Derived from the Teacher Ratings of the Child.—Like the mother’s interview, the teacher’s questionnaire was
administered when the index child was
between 17 and 19 years old so as to obtain ratings of the child’s intellectual,
emotional, and social functioning by the
teacher who in each case was most familiar with the child. In general, the
teacher was given a trait (e.g., moody)
and asked to rate the child on a 5-point
scale. Ten scales derived from the
teacher questionnaire were used in the
analyses reported here. The first four relate to academic performance and cognitive ability, and the last six relate to aspects of the child’s psychosocial
adjustment. The ten scales and reliabilities were: (1) Mathematics Proficiency,
0.95; (2) Reading Proficiency, 0.90; (3)
Work Organization Skills, 0.88;. (4)
Reasoning Skills, 0.88; (5) Emotionality, 0.86; (6) Peer Relations, 0.75; (7)
Aggression, 0.81; (8) Impulsivity, 0.81;

(9) Self-Serving Assertiveness, 0.75;
and (10) Social Responsibility, 0.90.
These data were available for 51 LBW
children and 280 FBW children.

Data ANALYSES

The initial analyses involved a series
of t-tests comparing the LBW group
with the FBW group on all of the outcome measures. The purpose of this set

analyses was to describe the differential
sensitivity to environmental variables
within the LBW group and the total
sample, by sex. In the first two regression analyses eight independent variables were regressed on the school problems outcome for the total sample
(N = 795), with males and females analyzed separately. In the second two analyses, the males (N=51) and the females (N=43) were analyzed
separately within the LBW sample. The

latter analyses involved only seven predictors, since birthweight was left out.
The same sequence of analyses was
completed for the “academic performance” outcome.

The reason for analyzing the sexes
separately is that the literature is inconclusive with respect to sex differences in
sensitivity to environmental factors. As
noted earlier, previous research with
low-birthweight children has shown
some indication that females are more
sensitive to certain types of environmental influences (Beckwith and Cohen,
1984; Sigman et a}., 1981). However, in
general, the literature on sex differences
in sensitivity to environmental factors
indicates that males are the more sensitive (Gottesman, 1974, Maccoby and
Jacklin, 1974; Mitchell, 1981). Outcomes derived from the teacher ratings
were not similarly analyzed because the
numbers in the subsample cells were too
small.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREDICTOR
VARIABLES

As noted previously, the quality of
infant-caretaker interaction has been
found to be an important factor in the
development of LBW infants. In this
study, the following home environment
descriptors were used to indicate the
several dimensions that are assumed to
influence the adult-child interaction patterns of the home:

Number of Family Constellations.—
This variable is defined by the continuity
provided by the adult figures in the
child’s immediate environment, as measured by the number of changes in family constellations. A change was recorded every time an adult moved in or
out of the home, e.g., father moving
out, relative or stepfather moving in. A
change was also recorded whenever the

child moved to another home environment such as a boarding school or a children’s home. The total number of constellations experienced by each child
was summed to produce a single composite score on this variable. The information was obtained during the interview with the mother and verified by the
Danish Population Register.

Mother Characteristics.—Two variables describing mother attributes were
identified as potential influences on the
quality of interaction which occurred in
the home. These variables were measured by two scales derived from the information obtained through the social
worker’s visit in the home. One portion
of the interview required the social
worker to describe and evaluate different aspects of the home and neighborhood, as well as the parents’ values and
personality characteristics. Great effort
was expended in the training of the social workers to assure consistency in the
application of the criteria in coding the
items. Since the responses to the questions were based on the interviewers’
subjective evaluations rather than on
concrete or recorded events, detailed
sets of coding conventions were preestablished and continuous interinterviewer comparisons of codings
were carried out. This procedure was
followed to increase scale reliability and
to ensure greater validity of the descriptions of the infants’ home environment.

Two of the scales developed on the
basis of these data were used as predictors: (1) Mother’s Contentment and (2)
Mother’s Orderliness. The items in the
Mother’s Contentment scale are comprised of social worker perceptions of
how satisfied, or at least how well
adapted, the mother was with her general situation. The actual rating for each
item was not based on a direct response

Social Biology

to a single item by the mother but rather
on the social worker’s assessment that
included elements of the entire interview (alpha = 0.77). The items in the
Mother’s Orderliness scale are comprised of social worker perceptions of
the order and care that the mother
brings to the house and to herself. Every
attempt was made to eliminate economic considerations in the perception;
for example, it made no difference
whether or not the furniture or dress was
new and fashionable, only that they
were clean, functional, etc. (alpha = 0.80). The correlation between
mother’s orderliness and mother’s contentment was r = 0.21, indicating considerable independence.

Crowding in the Home.—This variable isa single item indicating the number
of people per room in the household at
the time of follow-up. It constitutes another possible mediator of the generally
reported SES influence on development.

Socioeconomic Status.—The information used in calculating the subject’s
socioeconomic status was obtained from
the mother’s interview. The scale used
was developed by Svalastoga (1959) for
specific use with Danish populations.
The coding range from “0” for an unskilled worker to ‘‘7” for a person with
higher academic education and/or one
occupying a leadership position.

Sex.—This variable was coded 1-2 for
males and females respectively.

Medical Predictors —Two medical
variables were included in the analyses
of the total sample: Birthweight coded in
grams, and a variable describing the
subjects’ Motor Development at One
Year. The latter variable is an indicator
of abnormality or lag in the early motor
development of the subjects. The higher
the score the more problems, or the

female LBW groups, the birthweight
variable was excluded from the set of
predictors.

RESULTS

Table 1 shows the means and standard deviations for the low and full
birthweight groups on the outcome variables. There are no significant differ
ences between the means of the two
groups. Thus, it appears that on these
longer-term outcomes the LBW group
does not show any differential impairment, although the mean differences between the two groups consistently favor
the full birthweight group. An analysis
of the LBW group based on differences
in size for gestational age also yielded no
significant differences on the outcome
measures (Hunt, 1982).

In the regression analyses, both
stepwise and simultaneous solutions
were computed. In the stepwise solution
(Cohen and Cohen, 1975), variables
were entered on the basis of the size of
their contribution to the squared multiple correlation. In the simultaneous solution (Cohen and Cohen, 1975), the effect of each independent variable was
tested after all other independent variables were held constant by partialling.
Only variables which were significant in
the stepwise solution were included in
the simultaneous solution.

Simultaneous and stepwise regression produced the following statistics for
each of the independent variables:

1. Squared semipartial correlation
(stepwise solution}—the increase in
the squared multiple correlation
which results when an independent
variable is added to the stepwise solution.

2. F-ratio (stepwise solution)}—a test of
the significance of the squared semipartial correlation in a stepwise solution.

3. Squared semipartial correlation (simultaneous solution}—the increase in
the squared multiple correlation
which results when an independent
variable is entered into the regression
after all other independent variables
are in the regression (i.e., the unique
contribution of an independent variable in the regression).

4, F-ratio (simultaneous-solution)—a
test of the significance of the unique
contribution of an independent variable.

In the first two analyses the eight independent variables were regressed on
the school problems outcome using the
total sample. Table 2 presents the means
and standard deviations of the analyzed
variables for the male and female
groups. Table 3 presents the correlation

matrix for the predictor variables included in the analyses. Tables 4 and 5

The analysis of the male sample included 344 subjects; the R? for the three
significant predictors was 0.20. Number
of Family Constellations contributed the
most to the equation: 11 per cent in the
stepwise and 9 per cent in the simultaneous solution. Two additional variables
contributed significantly: Mother's Confentment accounted for 6 per cent of the
variance in the stepwise and 4 per centin
the simultaneous solution; and Mother’s
Orderliness accounted for 3 per cent of
the variance in each solution. None of
the other predictors reached significance.

Table 5 presents the corresponding
analyses with the female subsample of
357 subjects. The R? for the significant
predictors was only 0.09. The same
three variables which showed significance in the male sample contributed to
the equation in the female sample, although in a different order of importance. Note, however, that the predictors accounted for considerably less
variance in the female sample. Mother's

The two analyses dealing with the
male and the female LBW groups are

even greater importance in the LBW
male group. Mother’s Orderliness accounted for 36 per cent of the variance in
the stepwise and 27 per cent in the simultaneous solution. Number of Family
Constellations accounted for 15 per cent

When the 8 independent variables
were regressed on the Academic Performance outcome for the total male
and female samples, the results were almost identical to the School Problems
analyses. The analysis of Academic Performance within the male LBW group
was also quite similar to its School ProbJems counterpart. The same three variables made significant contributions to

er’s Orderliness as the principal contributor. Table § shows the regression analysis summary for LBW males. The
LBW female analysis of Academic Performance reflected two dissimilarities:
(1) the Mother's Orderliness variable replaced the Number of Family Constellations as a significant contributor, and (2)
the proportion of variance contributed
to the solution by the significant variables increased from 20 to 26 per cent.
The LBW female analysis is shown in
Table 9.

As noted previously, outcomes derived from the teacher ratings were not

completed due to the small number of
cases in the male and female cells of the
LBW group.

DISCUSSION

These analyses indicate that the 94
LBW subjects included in this study did
not have significantly more difficulties in
school during late adolescence than did
the same-aged full-birthweight controls.
However, the means for the LBW group
consistently indicated comparatively
lower functioning. These results are
consistent with the predictions made in
the introduction and with the findings of
Sameroff and Chandler (1975), Mednick and Zachau-Christiansen (1981),
Birch and Gussow (1970), and Beckwith
and Parmelee (1986). That is, while the
LBW variable serves to identify an “‘at
risk” group at birth, in infancy and during long childhood, its residual influence
on long-term academic and psychosocial
outcomes seems minimal. Environmental influences become increasingly more
important as the child grows older. The
issue thus becomes one of determining
which social variables contribute the
most to selected long-term outcomes of
interest. More specifically, do low- and
full-birthweight adolescents possess differential characteristics with respect to
the environmental variables of influence?

The regression analyses of the total
samples of males and females show that
the same three environmental variables
contribute the most to the variance associated with the composite school problems variable: Number of Family Constellations, Mother’s Orderliness, and
Mother’s Contentment. The amount of
variance accounted for by these three
variables in the male subsample is twice

Baker et al.

Social Biology

that accounted for in the female subsample, indicating a somewhat greater sensitivity to those conditions in males. This
finding supports the notion of overall
greater sensitivity in males suggested by
Maccoby and Jacklin (1974). The fact
that SES did not represent a significant
contribution to either regression analysis indicated that once the variance associated with the three significant predictors was accounted for, the unique
variance associated with SES was too
small to contribute any further to the solution.

The amount of variance “‘explained”’
in the male LBW sample was remarkably higher than was explained in the
full-birthweight males and in both
groups of females. The two most robust
predictors were Mother's Orderliness
and Number of Family Constellations.
Together, these two variables accounted for approximately 61 per cent
of the variance in the LBW male sample. Clearly there is a strong indication
that the LBW males in this study are especially sensitive to the lack of structure
and order in the physical environment
(maternal orderliness) and in the social
environment (constellation changes or
lack of continuity in available adults).

The third significant predictor was
One Year Motor Development, accounting for an increment of 4 per cent of the
outcome variable variance. It is not surprising that this predictor, which involves an early indicator of the degree of
physical impairment, contributed to the
LBW male equation. Maccoby and
Jacklin (1974) have gathered evidence
that males in general are more vulnerable, and perhaps constitutionally
weaker, than females in infancy. One
Year Motor Development did not contribute to the equations for either sex in
the total sample analyses or to the equa
 
 

Vol. 34, No. 1-2

tion in the LBW female analysis. The
two significant environmental variables
contributed considerably more unique
variance to the equation in the analyses
of the LBW males. This is consistent
with the findings of Sameroff and Chandler (1975) who noted that after the first
few years environmental variables are
more reliable predictors of intellectual
performance than early medical variain bles.

seems to be a suggestion in these findings that females are more influenced by
characteristics of the mother than by
anything else in their environment. This
may be an effect of the higher degree of
identification and the more systematic
modeling that takes place between female children and their mothers. Since
the Sigman et al. (1981) study and the
present one both deal with LBW children, it is of interest to note that Baker
and Mednick (1984) found the total female group to be more influenced by
mother characteristics (particularly her

cem

contentment) than by other environmental factors such as family stability.

SUMMARY

It is clear that the LBW females in
this sample in general do not show
heightened sensitivity to environmental
factors, at least those included in these
analyses. However, the maternal contentment variable does have significant
predictive power in the female sample.
Since variables describing the psychoJogical make-up of the maternal figure
have been less frequently analyzed in
previous research than variables such as
SES, maternal education, and family
stability, what appears in this study to be
a female sensitivity to maternal psychological characteristics has remained relatively ignored. On the other hand, data
from the total male sample support the
literature with regard to a heightened
sensitivity of males to environmental
factors (Gottesman, 1974; Maccoby and
Jacklin, 1974; Mitchell, 1981; Wender,
1971), and, as hypothesized in this
study, this sensitivity was observed to an
even greater extent in the LBW males.
It should be noted that the LBW males
did not reflect significant sensitivity to
the psychological characteristic, maternal contentment. In the total sample
analyses (Mednick and Baker, 1981),
males were also found to be significantly
less influenced by this variable and more
influenced by other environmental variables.

The reported findings have some implications for the design of intervention
procedures aimed at preventing longterm impairment in LBW children. For
males, it appears that environmental situations characterized by stability of
adult figures and general order and

structure are more conducive to optimal
outcomes In female LBW subjects, the
heunistics for intervention designs are
less clear The strongest predictor, maternal contentment, 1s considerably less
powerful and obviously more difficult to
manipulate.
