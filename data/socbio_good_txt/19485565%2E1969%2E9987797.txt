Factors Related to Knowledge and

Practice of Family Planning in
East Pakistani Villages

Research on knowledge and practice of
family planning in Pakistan has been primarily descriptive. Generally, simple percentage distributions of these variables
have been reported with no attempt to relate them to other factors. This has been the
pattern of reporting in studies conducted by
the major research organizations of the
country (Central Evaluation Unit, East
Pakistan, 1966; Central Evaluation Unit,
West Pakistan, 1967; East Pakistan Research and Evaluation Center, 1968; Family Planning Association, 1966; National
Research Institute of Family Planning,
1966).

In light of this lack of analytical research, the present study is necessarily
exploratory. It will attempt to identify
factors related to knowledge and practice of
family planning, and hence the segments of
the population reached by the family-planning program, and also to identify groups
where fertility decline may be expected.
The factors focused upon are socioeconomic
status (occupation, education, landholding),
cooperative membership, family type, religion, age, and total living children.

The study was conducted in 1967 under
the auspices of the Pakistan Academy for
Rural Development, Comilla, East Pakistan. The Academy conducts rural development programs (Family Planning, Women’s
Education and Home Development, Agricultural Extension, Youth Education, etc.)
on an experimental basis for possible adoption at the national level. As early as 1961,
the Academy initiated a pilot family-planning program utilizing the “organizer
approach”! (A. M. Khan, 1963; Stoeckel,
Khan, and Choudhury, in press) in four
villages of the experimental area, ComillaKotwali thana.? By 1964, the number rose
to twenty-two. In the latter part of the year,
a new program which covered all villages of
the thana was implemented utilizing commercial distribution channels for sale of
contraceptives (A. H. Khan and Choldin,

1The “organizer approach” utilized village
women (organizers) who were nominated by their
local cooperative society for training and instruction
in family planning at the Academy. Upon completion of training, they conducted the following activities in their villages: visited with village women and
discussed and explained all facets of family planning;
sold contraceptive supplies (condoms and foam

tablets); and kept systematic records on women who
purchased contraceptives,

1965). The following year an IUCD clinic
was established.

METHODOLOGY

The data for the study were collected by
interviewing al] married couples (2,078) in
fifteen villages of Comilla-Kotwali thana in
the first three months of 1967. Information
on knowledge and practice of family planning was elicited from wives by female
interviewers, and social and economic data
from husbands by male interviewers.® Initially, only females were to be interviewed;
however, in pretesting, it was found that the
majority of women were unable to give information concerning their husbands’ occupations, education, and landholdings.

The fifteen villages were initially selected because surveys had been conducted in
them at an earlier time (ten of the villages
in 1962, and five in 1964) and baseline data
on family planning had been collected.
The original selection of the villages was
purposively made, and randomness cannot
be assumed.

Knowledge of family planning was obtained by asking the respondent, “Do you
know any methods of family planning?”
and if so, ‘““Name the methods you know.”
If the respondent was unable to name
methods, knowledge was not established.
Knowledge in this sense simply refers to the
respondent’s awareness that there are ways
to limit family size and does not imply that
he would actually know how to use a method.

Data on practice of family planning were
collected to identify couples currently practicing and those who had ever practiced.
The questions which elicited these data
were: “Have you ever used any methods of
family planning?” If so, ““What methods did
you use?” “Are you still using any meth

ods?” The couples who are currently using
contraceptive measures plus those who no
longer use them make up the total number of
couples who have ever practiced family
planning. This gives an indication of the
potential total number of users that would
have been expected had all couples continued practicing family planning.

In order to see if there was a relationship
between the selected factors and knowledge
and practice of family planning, a simple
chi-square test of independence was applied.
The null hypothesis was that there would
be no differences between the groups comprising the factors (socioeconomic-status
groups, members and nonmembers of cooperatives, joint and single families, Muslims and Hindus, age groups, and number of
living children) in the proportion of members who have knowledge of and have
practiced family planning.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The first portion of this section describes
the total distribution of knowledge and
practice for all fifteen villages, In the remaining portion, the relationships between
the selected factors and knowledge and
practice are analyzed.

As seen in Table 1, over two-thirds of the
couples knew about family planning. (A
study of five of the fifteen villages in 1964
found that only 4% of all couples had any
knowledge of family planning [A. H. Khan
and Choldin, 1965].) In contrast, only 7%
had ever practiced family planning, and
about 5% were currently practicing it.
This would seem to indicate that, administratively, the program had been fairly successful in reaching the majority of the
couples since knowledge was high. However, conventional contraceptive practice
does not appear to be substantial enough in
this area to realize the government’s goal of
a 20% reduction in the crude birth rate by
1970.

Vol. 16, No. 1

One possible explanation for the extremely low proportion of couples practicing is
that there is some sort of “stigma” connected with family planning and respondents
will not admit they practice it. (The majority of interviewers felt that in many
instances this was the case.) The data
afforded a rather unique instance for a
partial test of this proposition. Three of the
villages in the sample were under the “‘organizer” program where data on monthly
purchases of contraceptives by couples were
systematically collected. Hence, we had a
situation where the responses to knowledgeand-practice questions by couples who were
known users could be compared to their
actual behavior. Unfortunately, only 22
couples fell into this category, a number
hardly large enough to draw any positive
conclusions. Nevertheless, the findings are
still important, While only two respondents
indicated they had no knowledge of family
planning, about half (10) said they had
never practiced it. Depending, of course, on
the extent to which this result is representative, it has obvious implications for the interpretation of success or failure for familyplanning programs. That is, KAP (Knowledge, Attitude, Practice) studies may show
practice to be lower than it actually is and
conclude that it is not high enough to effect
a decline in fertility. This could result in
unnecessary and wasted efforts at program
change. Hence, interpretation of KAP
data, particularly for the rural area of East
Pakistan, must recognize, or at least take
into account, the possibility that there is a
“stigma” connected with family planning
and interpret results accordingly.

SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS

Husband’s occupation and education
show a significant relationship with knowledge about family planning.* The highest status groups (Business and Skilled
and Class 7+) have higher proportions
with planning knowledge than the re

maining groups. In contrast, there are no
significant differences between the proportions of landholding’ groups who have
knowledge of family planning (see Table
2). Similarly, there is no significant relationship between any of the status indicators and the proportion currently practicing
(see Table 3), While education and landholding are not related to ‘‘ever practiced,”
occupation shows a significant relationship.
The Business and Skilled occupations have
the highest proportion, while Farming
has the lowest (see Table 4).

In general, socioeconomic status does not
show a consistent relationship to practice of
family planning. One aspect of the familyplanning program has reached higher proportions of the high occupational and educational status groups as evidenced by the
higher proportion of couples with knowledge
about family planning; there are, however,
no significant differences within the status
indicators with regard to the current prac

are as follows: Business and Skilled—teachers, shop
owners, Carpenters, weavers, potters, tailors; Farm

laborers, rickshaw pullers, sweepers.

5 The data for landholding were recorded on the
basis of “kani’’ units. The value of one kani equals
0.4 acres. The lowest possible unit of landholding
equaled half a kani or 0.2 acres; hence, the categories are constructed on the basis of a two-tenths of an
acre interval.

tice of family planning. Even though the
high occupational status groups show significantly higher proportions who have ever
practiced, those who are currently practicing represent no particular stratum.

COOPERATIVE MEMBERSHIP

Members and nonmembers of cooperative societies do not differ significantly in
their knowledge about family planning.

Social Biology

However, members do have significantly
higher proportions currently practicing
family planning and who have ever practiced it (see Table 5).

These findings most probably have
resulted from the part the cooperative
societies have played in implementing the
family-planning program. In the earliest
stages of the program, the societies were
utilized as the major vehicle to convey

family planning to the populace. Since
members initially were more exposed to a
concentrated effort than nonmembers, it
would follow that they may be more predisposed to try and practice family planning.

FAMILY TYPE

Although the proportions of persons in
single families who have knowledge of and
practice family planning are higher than in
joint families,® the differences are not great

er than would be expected by chance (see
Table 6). These results have implications
for the dialogue concerning fertility differences between family types. One argument
is that fertility will be higher in single
families due to greater privacy (coital frequency will be higher) and the absence of
relatives to enforce religious sanctions

6A single family was defined as a family composed of parents and their unmarried children who
take food from the same kitchen, while a joint family

was a simple family plus one or more consanguineous relatives who take food from the same kitchen.

regarding periods of abstinence (Nag,
1965). The other position is that fertility
will be higher in joint families since they
can more easily (economically) accommodate an extra child (Chandrasekar, 1955;
Davis, 1955). Also, the cooperation and
assistance the couples receive from other
members of the joint family in rearing their
children may be unfavorable to the development of a strong motivation toward family
planning (Mathen, 1962).

family type makes no difference; there

difference resulting from the practice of
family planning between family types.

RELIGION

Religious affiliation shows a significant
relationship with knowledge and practice of
family planning (see Table 7). The proportion of Muslims who have no knowledge of
family planning is double that of Hindus.
The proportion of Hindus currently practicing family planning is almost three times
as great as Muslims, while the proportion
who has ever practiced it is twice as great.
A most striking result is that almost 90% of

the Hindus who have ever practiced family
planning are still practicing, compared with
60% for Muslims.

These results indicate that the welldocumented Hindu-Muslim fertility differential (Davis, 1951; Nag, 1962; Saxena,
1965; Sinha, 1957), showing higher fertility
among Muslims, should continue to be
maintained. The results also interject another factor that must be considered in the
differential, namely Hindu contraceptive
practices. Up to this point, the explanation
of the differential has been couched primarily in terms of religious customs, For
example, Kirk (1965) maintains that ritual
abstinence is less common among Muslims
than Hindus, although Muslims observe
abstinence during the daylight hours of
Ramadan. Hindu customs require prolonged abstinence following childbirth, and
frequently the mother must return to her
parents’ home for confinement. Thus, postpartum separation is likely to be longer for
Hindus than for Muslims. Kirk says further that these factors may explain the
fertility differential despite similar patterns
of early marriage and high proportion of
reproductive life spent by women in marriage.

Prior to family-planning programs, this
explanation may have been sufficient. In
light of the present results, however, the
explanation must go beyond the reasons for
the fertility differential to the reasons for the
differential in contraceptive practice. Obviously, these reasons cannot be provided
by the present data. Additional research is
necessary to examine the attitudinal, social,
and demographic factors which may be
associated with the greater practice of family planning among Hindus.

AGE OF WIFE

The age structure of wives shows a significant relationship with knowledge and
practice of family planning (see Table 8).
The highest proportion with knowledge

Family Planning in East Pakistan 35

occurs in the 25-29 year age group and the
lowest in the youngest age group, 15-19
years. The group 30-34 years of age has the
highest proportion currently practicing and
who have ever practiced, while the youngest
group has the lowest. All of the age groups
thirty years and older have higher proportions currently practicing than the groups
below thirty years. Similarly, the age groups
thirty years and older have higher proportions who have ever practiced.

The age groups which have the highest
fertility (20-24 and 25-29 years) have the
lowest proportions practicing family planning. In addition, the age group 25-29
years, which has the highest fertility of the
entire age structure, has slightly less than
half of the women currently practicing who
had ever practiced. This is the lowest proportion of all the age groups. Thus, the impact of family planning will occur in the
older portion of the age structure where
couples already have large families and are
generally practicing birth control to maintain their current size. Hence, the overall reduction in fertility will not be as great as it
would be if the younger portion practiced
family planning at the same rate.

NUMBER OF LIVING CHILDREN

Number of living children is significantly
related to knowledge and practice of family
planning (see Table 9). Knowledge is highest for couples with 4 or 5 children, followed closely by couples with 6 or more.
The proportions currently practicing and
who have ever practiced vary directly with
number of living children. The proportion of
couples currently practicing family planning
who have 4 or more children 1s over twice as
great as that of couples with 1 to 3 children;
the proportion of couples with 4 or 5 children
who have ever practiced family planning is
twice as great as that of couples with 1 to 3
children and three times as great as that of
couples with 6 or more children.

The results indicate that practice of

family planning is highest in the larger families where fertility potential generally is not
as great as in smaller families. If a substantial reduction in the growth rate is to be
attained, it will not be enough for large
families to maintain their current size. Small
families will also have to check their growth
by practicing family planning at rates at
least equal to or greater than large families
(assuming equal rates of use-effectiveness).
This is particularly important because the
smaller families will not be practicing family
planning as consistently as large families,
since for the most part they use it for purposes of spacing.

SUMMARY

A study describing knowledge and practice of family planning and identifying the
factors related to these variables was conducted in fifteen villages of Comilla-Kotwali
thana, East Pakistan. The findings indicated the following:

1. Administratively, the family-planning
program has been successful in reaching the
majority of the population; however, family
planning is still practiced by less than onetenth of the population. One explanation for
the reported low rate of practice is the
possibility that there is a “stigma” connected with family planning and respondents will
not admit they practice it.

2. Although the highest occupational and
educational status groups had significantly
higher proportions with knowledge of family
planning, socioeconomic status, in general,
showed no consistent relationship with
practice.

3. Cooperative members did not differ
significantly from nonmembers in knowledge of family planning. However, significantly higher proportions of members had
practiced and are currently practicing
family planning.

4, Joint and single families do not differ
significantly from each other in their know]edge and practice of family planning.

5. Significantly higher proportions of
Hindus than Muslims had knowledge of
and practiced family planning.

6. Knowledge of family planning was
highest in the age group 25-29 years and
lowest in the group 15-19 years. Practice
was highest for the portion of the age structure thirty years and older.

7. Couples with larger families (four or
more children) had significantly higher
proportions who had knowledge of and
practiced family planning than couples with
small families.

In conclusion, the families where fertility
decline may be expected, could be ideally
characterized as cooperative members, Hindus, with the wife thirty years of age or older,
and having four or more living children.
