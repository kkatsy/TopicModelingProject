ABSTRACT: One of the central elements of genetic counseling is the transmission of quantitative
information concerning risk of defects in an unborn child from counselor to client. In order to
investigate this subject, we studied the understanding of numeric and nonnumeric descriptions
of genetic risk by 190 pregnant women. Specifically, three risk issues were explored: (1) whether
women were able to interpret numeric risks as percentages; (2) whether shifting denominators
affected risk assessment; and (3) the comparative assessment of the risk of birth defects, in general, and the risk of a neural tube defect, in particular. Respondents were much less likely to
assign the correct percentage equivalent to numeric risk information when the denominator
was 1,000 rather than 100. The ability to correctly identify percentage equivalents affected respondents’ quantitative assessment of the frequency of neural tube defects. Shifting the denominator from 100 to 1,000, however, did not affect women’s quantitative assessment of the rarity
of birth defects. In general, the respondents preserved the relative risk of birth defects and neuraj tube defects in their choice of descriptive terms. The majority of women evaluated serious
birth defects as occurring “often” or “occasionally” and NTDS as occurring “‘rarely” or “very

 

rarely.”

Although researchers in medical genetics frequently test the comprehension of information that has been communicated to clients in a clinical setting
(Leonard et al., 1972; Whitten et al.,
1981; Lippman-Hand and Fraser,
1979), few have explored the specific issue of how quantitative risks are assessed by recipients of genetic counseling (Lippman-Hand and Fraser, 1979).
Even less attention has been paid to perception of risk information in genetic
screening programs than in genetic
counseling at a clinical level, even
though transmitting information about
genetic risk is often a central component
of screening programs. We present findings from a study of 190 pregnant,
middle-class, white women in suburban
obstetric practices which suggest that
subjective nonnumeric descriptions of

the magnitude of risk for a rare event
such as a birth defect may reflect the client’s thought processes as well as forced
or promoted numerical responses. The
importance of establishing a mutually
understood set of terms for communicating information about genetic risk in
education and counseling is thus emphasized.

Four specific topics were investigated, of which three reflected our interest in the process of risk perception: (1)
ability to interpret numerical information and the impact of such ability on
subjective, verbally framed perception
of risks; (2) the effect of framing of numeric risk information upon subjective
verbal perceptions of risk; (3) the perception of the relative magnitude of risk
of birth defects compared to the risk of a
neural tube defect. In addition, we in

vestigated a fourth topic, the association
of perceptions of the risk of a neural
tube defect with the subject’s opinion
concerning the justifiability of aborting
an affected fetus.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The subjects were 190 pregnant
women in the first or second trimester
who were serving as historical controls
for a subsequent study of the impact of
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) screening on
the psychological status of pregnant
women. The subjects were interviewed
over the telephone and had not been exposed to any form of AFP screening or
genetic counseling. The content of the
interview, methods of recruitment, and
demographic characteristics of the sample have been described previously (Faden et al., 1982). The typical subject in
this study was a white married woman
expecting her first or second child as a
patient of a private obstetrical practice
in Baltimore County, Maryland. Educational levels and occupational status of
the subjects are shown in Table 1.

Social Biology

The questionnaire items that we used
to construct the present report explored
respondents’ judgments concerning
risks.and probability. Subjects were told
that the risk of neural tube defects
(NTD’s) in a newborn was 1/1,000. The
risk of a serious birth defect was framed
in two ways: (1) a risk of 4/100 and (2) a
risk of 40/1,000. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of the two alternative framings, and all were asked to
interpret the percentage value of
1/1,000, to select appropriate verbal descriptions of the risks of a birth defect —
and of a neural tube defect, and to identify in percentage terms the risks of a
birth defect.

The resulting data were then coded
for correct or incorrect responses. Coding the data for descriptive judgments of
the magnitude of these risks required an
assessment by the investigators of the
commonly understood numerical equivalents of words like ‘‘often”’ or “‘rarely,”
and extensive latitude was permitted the
subjects in this respect. For example, ifa
risk of 1/1,000 was associated with the
adverbial description “rarely” or ‘‘very

“occasionally” or “often” for this risk
figure was coded as an incorrect answer.
In another aspect of the study, respondents were asked to report their
opinions concerning the justifiability of
abortion if the fetus were to be affected
with a neural tube defect and were
asked other questions concerning the
justifiability of abortion under various
circumstances (Faden et al., 1982).

RESULTS

INTERPRETATION OF RISKS AS
PERCENTAGES

Table 2 presents the responses to
items in which the subjects were asked
to express in terms of percentages (from
a list of multiple choices) the probability
of events that occur with a frequency of
1/1,000 (the quoted incidence of neural
tube defects).

The high frequency of incorrect assessment of the percentage equivalent
of 1/1,000 prompted us to investigate the
relationship of this outcome to the educational background of our subjects. Of
the 149 women who had not graduated
from a four-year college, 99 (66.4 per
cent) answered that question correctly;

of the 41 college graduates, 37 (90.2 per

p<0.01). Below the level of college
graduate there was no association between the subject’s educational level
and ability to interpret 1/1,000 correctly.
In another part of the questionnaire,
when 93 subjects were presented with a
denominator of 100, 69 (74.6 per cent)
correctly identified the risk of 4/100 as
equivalent to 4 per cent, whereas only 40
of 97 (41 per cent) presented with a denominator of 1,000 correctly identified
40/1,000 as 4 per cent. This difference
was highly significant (z = 4.591,
p<0.01). More than one-fourth of all
subjects could not correctly identify
1/1,000 as less than 1 per cent, although
the other choices were off by two orders
of magnitude, i.e., ‘10 per cent” and
“sreater than 10 per cent.”
Respondents’ qualitative assessment
of the frequency of neural tube defects
was affected by their ability to identify

(Table 3). Women who overestimated

EFFECT OF FRAMING ON RIsK
ASSESSMENT

The overwhelming majority of respondents evaluated serious birth defects as occurring either occasionally (53
per cent) or rarely (25 per cent), Framing the probability as 4/1,000 or 40/1,000
had no effect on women’s perception of
the rarity of the event.

PRESERVATION OF RELATIVE MAGNITUDE
IN Risk ASSESSMENT

Subjects who had been told that serious birth defects occur in 40/1,000 births
and NTD’s in 1/1,000 births tended to
preserve the relative magnitude of these
two events in their choice of descriptive
terms (Table 5). The majority of women
evaluated serious birth defects as occurring “often” or “occasionally,” and
NTD’s as occurring “rarely” or ‘‘very
rarely.” Those women who had been
given the 4/100 framing for serious birth
defects were not included in this analysis
because the purpose was to assess consistency within a given framing of the denominator.

RELATIONSHIP OF Risk PERCEPTION TO
Opinion CONCERNING THE
JUSTIFIABILITY OF ABORTION FOR NT D

The data show that there is no relationship whatever between a woman’s
perception of the rarity of NTD’s and
her opinion concerning the justifiability
of aborting a fetus affected with this condition. Of 173 respondents to this item,
134 felt that abortion was justifiable if
there was a high risk of NTD in the fetus. Of these women, 107 (79.9 per cent)
considered NTD to occur rarely or very
rarely. Of those 39 women who felt that
abortion of an affected fetus was not justifiable, 31 (79.5 per cent) agreed that
NTD occurred rarely or very rarely.
These proportions were nearly identical. Thus, the subjects’ ethical judgment
concerning the justifiability of abortion
for an affected fetus did not appear to be
associated with their assessment of the
frequency of the condition.

DISCUSSION

A principal emphasis in genetic counseling is the effective communication of
recurrence risks, incidence rates, and
other probabilistic information to clients. The ability of recipients to learn
and recall such information has been
used as a measure of the success of genetic counseling (Leonard et al., 1972).
This emphasis reflects the belief that
only accurate numerical assessment of
genetic risks will properly facilitate informed decisions regarding reproduction.

Unfortunately, there is great uncertainty about the basic processes involved in the learning of probabilities.
We lack systematic appreciation of the
mental steps taken in the comprehension of numerically expressed uncer

tainty. A person may decipher probabilistic information by a process of deductive logic but also by intuition, as by a
mental picture of a relative length of two
line segments or in a more structured
visual image like a graph or a pie chart.
In the case of genetic counseling it is not
known whether or in what ways the ability to perform basic numerical operations with recurrence risks or rates (e.g.,
translation of these rates into percentages) is related to understanding of the
meaning of these rates. Our own findings on this issue are somewhat inconsistent. In the case of serious birth defects,
women’s descriptions of the magnitude
of risk (e.g., rarely vs. often) was not associated with the ability to translate the
incidence rate into its percentage equivalent. Possibly the greater familiarity of
our subjects with birth defects accounts
for this finding. However, in the case of
neural tube defects, there was a significant association between women’s
comprehension of the incidence rate in
percentage terms and their perception
of the likelihood of this defect. Women
who overestimated the percentage
equivalent or 1/1,000 were significantly
more likely to view NTD’s as occurring
“often” and “occasionally.”’;,.

Possibly the greater:familiarity of our
subjects with birth defects accounts for
the findings. When experience does not
supply the information required to generate an accurate verbal perception of
risk, one must resort to theoretical
knowledge. This interpretation reflects
recent speculation that base rate information is important principally when
dealing with new situations (Ajzen,
1977). In our sample, over 76 per cent
reported knowing someone who had a
serious birth defect. Thus, these women
had ample prior and personal experience on which to base their perception

 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:41 08 December 2015

62 Chase et al.

that birth defects occur occasionally or
rarely. By contrast, only 17 per cent of
our sample knew what a neural tube defect was, and only 3.7 per cent knew
someone who had this condition. The
only information on which the women
could base their judgment about frequency was thus the probabilistic information provided to them, and in this
case the ability to convert rates into percentages did affect judgments of likelihood.

If the ability to translate rates into
percentages is a necessary component of
the understanding of probability and if
such information affects perceptions of
risk in novel situations, then genetic
counselors face a formidable educational task, particularly with those who
are not highly educated. In our study,
fully 33 per cent of women with less than
a college education could not recognize
that 1/1,000 was equivalent to less than 1
per cent, even when the other alternatives in this multiple choice question
were off by two orders of magnitude.

This finding is not surprising, however, when placed in the context of the
general educational literature on performance with percentage computations. Despite the presumably universal
exposure to per cents of students in the
public schools (Kramer, 1966), observation and research indicate that students
have difficulty in learning the subject,
and their grasp does not improve as they
move through the public school system.
In an early study, Guiler found that 90
per cent of ninth-graders could not readily calculate anumber when a per cent of
that number is given (Guiler, 1946). The
more recent National Assessment of
Educational Progress also found that
both school children and adults had limited ability to manipulate per cents in
problems, including both transforma
Social Biology

tion of fractions into their equivalent
percentages and the problems mentioned from the Guiler study (Carpenter
et al., 1975).

Turning now to the issue of framing
effects in the presentation of numeric
probabilistic information, we found no
evidence in this study of the widely held
view that numerators dominate denominators in clients’ perceptions of genetic
risk information (Lippman-Hand and
Fraser, 1979). If this bias had operated
in our study, women presented with
birth defect rates of 40/1,000 would have
judged birth defects as more likely
events than those women who were
given the rate 4/100. We can only speculate as to why we failed to identify a numerator bias in this case. Perhaps both
numerator and denominator information were ignored in both framings, and
judgments about likelihood employed
some variation of the “availability heuristic” in which estimates of probability
are influenced by the ease with which
examples of the event come to mind
rather than by probabilistic information
(Tversky and Kahneman, 1973).

Subjects in this study were generally
internally consistent in their use of ordinal, verbal phrases to describe risk. Specifically, women tended to select appropriately different phrases to describe the
frequency of birth defects and neural
tube defects. This finding might be interpreted as supporting an increased reliance on nonnumeric descriptions of
probability in genetic counseling, a
practice already common among genetic counselors (Lippman-Hand and
Fraser, 1979; Bloch et al., 1977). However, there are several good reasons for
not making nonnumeric information the
only or even the major mode for communicating probabilistic information in
genetic counseling. Several studies have

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:41 08 December 2015

Vol. 33, No. 1~2

demonstrated that the numeric “‘equiva
_lents’? people attach to probability

phrases are highly sensitive to the context in which these judgments are made
(Lichtenstein and Newman, 1967;
Simpson, 1963; Cohen et al., 1958). For
example, while in our study the adverb
“rarely” was much more frequently selected to describe the frequency of neural tube defects (0.1 per cent) than the
frequency of serious birth defects (4 per
cent), in other studies this adverb has
been associated with probabilities between 5 per cent and 7 per cent (Lichtenstein and Newman, 1967; Cohen et
al., 1958). Because people differ so
much in the way they use and quantify
probability phrases, it is perhaps not
surprising that recipients of genetic
counseling appear to prefer numeric to
nonnumeric information (Bloch et al.,
1979). Although verbal expressions of

probability no doubt play an important
role in genetic counseling, they are nota
fully satisfactory substitute for numeric
probabilities. An alternative response
to the recognition that people have difficulty in interpreting such information
is to develop improved techniques for
effective presentation. In addition, further insight into the processes by which
quantitative information is acquired and
processed will help genetic counselors to
deal with their clinical task more successfully.
