Socioeconomic Changes, Maternal Age, and

Down’s Syndrome in a Swedish Population

The purpose of this investigation is to
examine the influence of changing socioeconomic conditions on the distribution of
maternal age in two small human populations closely connected with each other by
immediate geographical proximity and administrative links but with entirely different histories.

The statistical data were collected from
the birth registers of two neighboring parishes, Froso and Ostersund, in the province
of Jamtland in Sweden for the two periods
1800-20 and 1840-60.

Froso comprises an island with the same
name in Lake Storsjon and has been known
since early historical times as a center of
trade, administration, and culture. The
ancient road from the far north to the
central and southern provinces of the
Scandinavian peninsula and to the European continent touched on Froso. It was
also on the trade route of the Jamtland
peasants when taking their wares—furs,
leather goods, horses, copper, and silver
ore—to Norway as well as to the markets
of southern Sweden. As early as the thirteenth century, it was on the pilgrims’ road
to Trondheim. Its three annual markets,
and especially the St. Gregor market, attracted numerous merchants, farmers, and

craftsmen from Norway and Sweden from
the beginning of fifteenth century. Situated
468 meters above sea-level and 176 meters
above Lake Storsjon, Froso was also an
important military outpost. The fort, built
in 1611, played an important role during
the war against Norway. Froso School,
founded in 1674, developed over a period
of 170 years a significant educational activity and cultural influence.

At the end of the eighteenth century,
Froso gradually lost its importance because
a new town, Ostersund, was built on the
opposite shore of the lake, and this town
became the capital of Jamtland. Ostersund
was founded by royal ordinance in 1786.
The allocation of building plots for the
settlers in the projected town began in 1788,
but the interest was slight, and in 1790 the
town had only 21 inhabitants. It was not
until the beginning of the nineteenth century that the number of inhabitants exceeded a thousand.

To stimulate the development of the new
town, several institutions were transferred
there, mainly from Froso: the pharmacy
in 1788, the post office in 1797, the annual
St. Gregor market in 1798, and the customs
house from Duved in 1817. Yet, the development of Ostersund proceeded very slowly

and unfavorably during the first period of
its existence. The new settlers came reluctantly, and some of them remained in the
town only a short time. There were also
several lawbreakers and delinquents among
them. The state of general stagnation is
shown by the number of shops in the town
(7), which did not change from 1800 to
1830, and by the number of craftsmen,
which increased during the same period
from 25 to 30.

The data have been allocated to two
periods. The first one, from 1800 to 1820,
was quite unsuccessful for both parishes.
Froso lost its significance and fell into economic decay mainly because of the removal
of the St. Gregor market. Ostersund was in
a state of disorder and economic depression,
especially after the lean years 1812 and
1813.

The second period comprises the years
from 1840 to 1860. During these years
Froso declined into insignificance, but in
1840 Ostersund entered its first period of
prosperity. Settlers came, many new houses
were built, especially between the years
1843 and 1847, and two large business
enterprises were started. In 1845 the first
printing office began to operate and a
weekly newspaper, Ja@mtlands Tidning, was

published. Froso School was removed to
Ostersund in 1847. The population increased from 459 in 1840 to 818 ten years
later, and to 1,496 in 1860.

For the analysis of the distribution of
maternal age, the data have been divided
by six age classes, the two parishes, and the
above-mentioned time period as shown in
Table 1. The results were also compared
with mean distribution for the total Swedish population in the nineteenth century.

As can be seen in Table 1, during the
first period the number of childbearing
women aged below 30 years is higher by
4.7 per cent in Ostersund, while the number of childbearing women aged 35 and
over is higher by 5.2 per cent in Froso.
These differences may be explained as a
direct effect of the lower average age of
the new settlers and of the more pressing
necessity to start a family in the new settlement.

The distribution of maternal age within
both populations in the early period of the
nineteenth century must be considered to
have been biologically unfavorable because
56.6 per cent of childbearing women in
Froso and 54.5 per cent in Ostersund were
aged 30 years and over. Highly significant
differences emerged in the second period.

8S Brief Reports

As many as 19.3 per cent more women in
Ostersund than in Froso had delivered below the age of 30 years. This fact can be
attributed to the improved economic conditions in the town which made earlier
marriage possible. At the same time, in
impoverished Froso, the surplus of women
aged 30 years and more at parturition rose
from 2.1 per cent in the early period of the
nineteenth century to 18.3 per cent in the
years 1840-60. In all, as many as 66.9 per
cent of mothers in Froso were 30 years and
older at time of delivery as compared with
only 47.6 per cent in Ostersund.

Compared with Sweden in the nineteenth
century as a whole, the demographic situation in the new town must have been markedly different. In the first decades, 6.0 per
cent fewer childbearing women in Ostersund than in Sweden as a whole were 30
years and over. During the following
period, this difference increased to 12.8
per cent.

The mean maternal age during the first
period under examination was 30.7 years
in Ostersund and 31.6 years in Froso. During the following decades, the differences
between the compared populations changed
remarkably. The mean maternal age
dropped in Ostersund to 28.8 years and,
at the same time, increased in the neighboring parish to 32.2 years. Thus, the differences between the two populations increased
from 0.9 to 3.4 years. In Sweden as a whole,

the mean maternal age remained constant
during the nineteenth century at about 31
years.

In Ostersund, particularly during 184060, the risk of childbirth not only extended
over a longer period of life but also was
concentrated in the more favorable segments of the reproductive period. From
this fact one might expect an increased
effective fertility as well as a relative decrease of congenital malformations and
diseases associated with high maternal age,
e.g., Down’s syndrome.

The expected incidence of Down’s syndrome in the examined populations has
been calculated with the aid of coefficients
of age-dependent risk given by Collman
and Stroller (1962) with the results shown
in Table 2. Because of the different maternal age distributions, the calculated incidence of Down’s syndrome per thousand
births is for both periods of time higher in
Froso than in Ostersund. Figure 1 shows
how the calculated incidence of Down’s
syndrome per thousand births in the population varies with the observed maternal
age distributions in the two parishes and
in nineteenth-century Sweden. The observations can thus be fitted into a model
showing how social changes via maternal
age changes have an impact on the incidence of congenital malformations in a
population.
