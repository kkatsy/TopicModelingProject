A Eugenic Effect of Medical Care

ABSTRACT: When sophisticated medical attention substantially increases the life expectancy of
individuals with a severe homozygous condition without significantly raising their reproductive
success, an increase in parental investment should render a concomitant decrease in parental
ability to reproductively compensate. This process will lower the expected number of heterozygous carriers produced by heterozygous parents and, in turn, will lower the equilibrium frequency

of the gene.

In the absence of a heterozygote advantage, recessive genes that render a deleterious condition will naturally decrease
in frequency, albeit slowly, until their
existence depends on the mutation rate.
For purposes of this paper, a eugenic effect
is an effect that accelerates this rate of
decrease and/or lowers the frequency at
which equilibrium is attained. A dysgenic
effect is one that decelerates that decrease
and/or elevates the equilibrium frequency.
That modern medical care can have an
inadvertent eugenic effect on the frequency of genes that confer a lethal homozygous condition, though less obvious
than its converse, proceeds in a straightforward manner when the following terms
are related to each other as indicated:
Medical Caref—Homozygote Longevity{—Heterozygote Parental  Investment{—Heterozygote Reproductive Compensation}—Heterozygote Selective Disadvantagef—Gene Frequency].

The key concepts in this paradigm are
parental investment (PI) and reproductive
compensation. Parental investment, as
defined by R. L. Trivers (1972), is a reproductive cost function whose measurement
is made “by reference to its negative effect
on the parent’s ability to invest in other

offspring: a large parental investment is
one that strongly decreases the parent’s
ability to produce other offspring” (p.
139). This definition rests on the assumption that a given set of parents possesses
some finite amount of resources that can
be expended on bearing and rearing offspring. Since there is no necessary relationship between the size of an investment
and the return on that investment, a given
individual offspring may consume more or
less than the amount of PI required to rear
an average offspring. Accordingly, a set of
parents possessing the PI required by four
normal offspring may have three or five
offspring, depending on the amount of PI
required by their particular children (cf.
Hartung, 1977). The “expenses” incurred
by childbearing and childrearing involve
any limiting factor; they can be biological,
emotional, temporal, material, etc. For
example, during pregnancy, a woman’s
investment is very high for about eleven
months, not so much as a result of her
offspring’s energy requirements, but because she can not be reimpregnated during
this time.

Reproductive compensation simply refers to the fact that parents can almost
completely “compensate,” in terms of re

productive success, for children who are
nonreproductive if such children do not
consume much PI. For example, a conceptus that is spontaneously (or therapeutically) aborted in the first trimester is not
likely to have consumed an amount of PI
that will significantly affect a parent’s total
reproductive success. The relationship between PI and reproductive compensation
is inverse while the relationship between
longevity and PI is direct (Figures 1 and
2).

The importance of this consideration
lies in its effect on the fitness of a gene that
is lethal in the homozygous state, but
which does not directly affect the reproductive success of heterozygous carriers
(does not reduce the size of the F, generation). In this situation, the longevity of the

homozygote can affect the number of
heterozygotes produced by carrier parents.
That is, a long-lived high-PI-consuming
homozygote will have a greater negative
effect on his parent’s reproductive success
than will a short-lived low-PI-consuming
homozygote.

If the prevailing medical environment
greatly increases the life expectancy of a
homozygote, it can be seen that such an
environment will increase the disadvantage of the heterozygous parents. As a
hypothetical example, consider two sets of
parents (A and B) in which: (1) each parent
carries the gene that is lethal in the homozygous state; (2) each couple has the PI
resources required by four normal children; (3) the couples live under extremely
disparate medical conditions; and (4) the

Fic. 2.—As longevity and parental investment increase, parental ability to reproductively compensate

life expectancy of the homozygote depends
on medical care. If couple A lives in a
medically unsophisticated environment
such that their homozygous offspring (p =
0.25) will not survive long enough to reduce their ability to reproductively compensate, they will have four offspring.
None will be homozygous recessive, but
each will have a 0.66 probability of being
a carrier (expected number of heterozygotes = 2.7). If couple B’s medical situation allows their homozygous offspring to
survive long enough to consume the
amount of PI normally required by one
offspring, couple B will also produce four
offspring (expected: 2 carriers, 1 homozygote, 1 noncarrier). Assuming conditions
to be constant for A’s and B’s children,
couple A will have 16 grandchildren with
an expected number of carriers ~5.33 if

 

such grandchildren are not conceived by
cross with an exogenous carrier (the expected number of heterozygotes will increase according to the frequency of the
gene and the resultant probability that one
of A’s children will mate with a carrier).
Couple B, with a continuous medical advantage, will have only 12 grandchildren,
and the expected number of carriers will
be 4. This effect does not require that the
homozygote consume more PI than a normal offspring, though such children often
drain parents of more resources, especially
emotional and material, than do their
healthy siblings. Reproductive compensation can be categorized as complete (one
for one replacement of lost homozygous
offspring), over (replacement by more than
one additional offspring), or partial (replacement by less than one additional offDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

spring). The hypothesized eugenic effect
occurs whenever the degree of compensation is reduced, especially when it is reduced to negative compensation, i.e., “replacement” of homozygous offspring by
less than zero additional offspring (when
the homozygote consumes more than normal PI). Of course, the possibility of negative compensation is greatly enhanced by
the availability of effective contraception.

THE MODEL

The hypothesized selective disadvantage is not strictly “heterozygote disadvantage” in the common use of the term. That
is, it does not represent a reduction in the
viability or fertility of all heterozygotes,
but refers only to the production of reproductive offspring by heterozygoteheterozygote crosses.

Consider a random mating situation
with initial genotype frequencies:

AA = 4%,
Aa= y,
ada = 2.

Heterozygote-heterozygote crosses would
normally occur with frequency y?, producing offspring in a 1:2:1 ratio. If, however,
the recessive a is lethal and parents are
able to completely compensate for homozygous recessive offspring, two heterozygous parents will produce offspring in
numbers proportional to their mating frequency, but in a 1:2 ratio, AA:Aa.
Genotype frequencies in the next generation would be:

x2 + xy + y¥/3

AA’ = (x + y)?
and

Aa’ = (x + y)? ’

(Consumption of less than a normal
amount of PI represents an intermediate
case, but is more difficult to express mathematically.) If homozygous recessives consumed more than a normal amount of PI,
and thereby reduced their parents’ offspring production by a fraction s, the
genotype frequencies in the next generation would be:

x*+ xy + %(1 — sy?

and

EXAMPLE

Cystic fibrosis is an important example
(~1 in 20 Caucasians is a carrier) of a
recessive allele whose heterozygous fitness
could be negatively affected by medical
care. In 1938 the expected survival of
homozygotes at 10 years of age was 1 per
cent (Warwick and Poque, 1969), with an
expected mean longevity of less than 1
year (Bowman, 1976). Today the expected
survival at 12 years is 72 per cent (Holzel,
1975) in the United States, and 45 per cent
at 20 years in Great Britain (Mearns,
1974), with a mean survival of 16 years
(Bowman, 1976). While cystic fibrosis
homozygotes have gained considerable
longevity, their fertility remains negligible
for purposes of significantly affecting the
gene frequency (Taussig et al., 1972; Denning et al., 1968; Kaplan et al., 1968;
Feigelson et al., 1969; Bumbalo, 1969;
Rule et al., 1970; Holsclaw et al., 1971;

increases and the resultant eugenic effect is enhanced. However, as life expectancy extends beyond

anemia (HbS) homozygotes probably have
sufficient reproductive success to counter
any negative effect on their heterozygous
parents (Billina and _ Bickers, 1974;
Karayalcin et al., 1975; Powars, 1975;
Anderson, 1971; Gima and Lee, 1975). In
contrast to the HbS homozygote, whose
fertility depends largely on medical care,
HbC homozygotes have probably always
had a sufficient probability of normal reproduction (Powars, 1975; Anderson,
1971; Gima and Lee, 1975; River et al.,
1961). Like HbS homozygotes, information on HbC homozygotes has often been
based on hospital populations, and the
severity of the condition has been overestimated accordingly (Billina and Bickers,
1974; Powars, 1975; Gima and Lee, 1975;
River et al., 1961; Attah et al., 1975). In
contrast to both HbS and HbSC, severe

1974; Piomelli et al., 1974; Sloman, 1974;
Canale et al., 1974). Carter et al. (1971)
and Sultz et al. (1972) report data for the
sickle hemopathies and cystic fibrosis
which indicate an absence of reproductive
compensation (Sultz et al., 1972) or even
negative compensation (Carter et al.,
1971).

While medical treatment of some conditions has been so successful as to counter
the hypothesized eugenic effect (e.g., HbS
anemia and PKU deficiency) by sufficiently raising the expected fertility of
homozygotes, other conditions are not yet
sufficiently well treated to affect parental
ability to reproductively compensate.
Tay-Sachs disease exemplifies a condition
which may soon move out of this category
and into the category of a disease whose
frequency will diminish as a by-product of
more effective medical care and increased
longevity.

Of course, the sword of the medical insignia is double-edged, and the eugenic
effect hypothesized here, no matter how
strongly it applies in reality, can not
counter the potential dysgenic effect of
amniocentesis; that is, if therapeutic abortions are elected only when the fetus is
homozygous for a deleterious recessive,
and not in the case of carrier fetuses, then

the paradigm becomes: Therapeutic

Kidwell, 1972; Fraser, 1972a, 19726). Although complete reproductive compensation is likely to raise the equilibrium frequency of a recessive lethal, it is unlikely,
as originally hypothesized by Lewontin
(1953), to raise frequency levels to those
generally attributed to balanced polymorphism (cf. Williams, 1959).
