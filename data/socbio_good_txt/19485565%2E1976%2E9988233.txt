ABSTRACT: Previous tests of the economic theory of fertility using multivariate regression techniques have generally analyzed only cross-sectional data. Some students of fertility, notably
Janowitz (1973a,b), have argued that such studies must also be conducted with change data. This
paper presents tests of the economic theory of fertility with both cross-sectional and change data
for the 48 contiguous states. The cross-sectional analyses examined the effects of male and female
income on the marital fertility of 20-24 year olds for 1950, 1960, and 1970 while controlling for the
effects of education, urbanization, race, religion, and population density. Controlling for the
effects of the same noneconomic variables, a second set of multivariate regression analyses
examined the effects of changes in male and female income on changes in the level of marital
fertility of 20-24 year olds during the 1950-60 and 1960-70 periods. Both the analyses with

cross-sectional data and change scores provided support for the economic theory.

Several studies either directly concerned
with the economic theory of fertility or
relevant to it have been published in recent years. Among these, analyses by
Mincer (1963), Bean and Wood (1974),
and Gardner (1973) utilized individual
level data while studies by Heer and
Boynton (1970), Gardner (1972), DeTray
(1973), and Cain and Weininger (1973)
employed areal data (areal units in the
latter four studies were counties, states,
counties, and SMSA’s, respectively). Almost all of these studies used male income
as the indicator of capability to purchase
children and female income or wage level
as the indicator of cost of children. Also,
all of these studies attempted to control for
the effects of one or more noneconomic
variables thought to affect fertility (such as
female educational level, urbanization,
race, religion, and population density) by
entering the noneconomic variables along
with the indicators of capability to pur
- chase children and cost of children in mul
tivariate regression analyses of marital fertility. The results of both individual level
and aggregate level studies have tended to
support the economic theory.

All of these recent studies, however,
have suffered from certain limitations.
First of all, most of these efforts have involved the use of cross-sectional data collected at one point in time. The lone exception to this criticism was the study of
SMSA’s by Cain and Weininger (1973) in
which the authors performed essentially
the same regression analyses on similar
areal units at two points in time, 1960 and
1940.

A further central weakness of all the
cited studies has been the fact that all of
the regression analyses have been performed on cross-sectional data. Although
such analyses constitute inherently static
images of the interrelationships of levels of
variables, the results have been assumed
to represent estimates of how the change in
the level of each independent variable af

fects change in the dependent variable.
Janowitz (1973a,b) questioned the validity
of drawing conclusions about how changes
in variables are related to change in a dependent variable on the basis of results
from cross-sectional analyses. She performed a multiple regression analysis of
changes in fertility over two points in time
by utilizing differences in the levels of variables from the earlier to the later point in
time as measures of change. Janowitz’s
findings with change data were not consistent with those of earlier cross-sectional
studies of the variation of fertility among
nations.

This result motivated Janowitz to conclude that the theoretical positions supported by the earlier cross-sectional
studies were now lacking in meaningful
verification. Although there seem to be no
firm methodological grounds for assuming
that cross-sectional results are inherently
less valid than change analysis results
(none were really provided in Janowitz’s
argument), Blalock (1964, p. 131) and
Kasarda (1972) have concluded that more
faith can be posited in a set of regression
findings if the analyses have yielded the
same results with both cross-sectional and
change data (although they also provide
no methodological argument for the
superiority of one mode of analysis over
the other).

Beyond the exclusive reliance on crosssectional data, a final limitation of the past
studies lies in the fact that none of them,
with the possible exception of Cain and
Weininger (1973), have really come close
to exhausting the set of noneconomic variables suspected of exerting effects on fertility. Therefore, it is highly probable that in
some of them the estimates of the effects of
the economic factors on fertility are biased
in an unknown way (the economic variables may not have been sufficiently
purged of noneconomic effects on fertility).
The goal of the present study was to

227

conduct a test of the economic theory of
fertility which would not suffer from the
limitations discussed above. Thus, the
analyses presented in this paper were conducted on the same areal units at three
points in time, 1950, 1960, and 1970,
using cross-sectional data, and for two ten
year periods, 1950-60 and 1960-70, using
change data. Furthermore, all noneconomic variables shown to affect fertility
in previous studies were entered into the
regressions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The goal set forth for this study in the
previous section necessitated the use of
areal data, since no individual data collected in the past exists, as far as I know,
with which to perform comparable
analyses. I was able to construct measures
for the various variables required in the
analyses for the 48 contiguous states of
the United States over the period of 1950
to 1970 from data available in the U.S.
census, the National Catholic Almanac,
and the statistical abstracts of the United
States.

Since the economic theory of fertility
has been formulated largely in terms of
family decision-making processes, individual level data might be viewed as
superior to aggregate data in testing the
theory due to the fact that areal studies are
vulnerable to the danger of the “ecological
fallacy” (Robinson, 1950). However,
numerous social scientists, including Heer
and Boynton (1970), Hammond (1973),
Cain and Weininger (1973), and Loftin
and Hill (1974), have argued that areal
data should be utilized in situations in
which individual leve] data suitable for
the desired analyses do not exist. Furthermore, several students of fertility have
pointed out that areal-level analyses enjoy
certain advantages over individual-level
analyses, leading to the conclusion that

   
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

228

areal analyses should be conducted (complimentary to individual level analyses)
even when appropriate individual data
exist. The reader should examine Heer
and Boynton (1970), Gardner (1973), and
Cain and Weininger (1973) for arguments
in this regard especially relevant to the
study of fertility.

VARIABLES

The measure of fertility used in the
analyses of this study was the rate of children ever born to ever-married women
aged 20-24 (CEBM). The analyses were
conducted for this age category for several
reasons. First, the author judged that the
rate of children ever born to this youngadult age category would most exclusively, in contrast to alternative age categories, display immediate response to concurrent levels of income of same-aged
males and income available to females,
since past levels of these variables could
not have come into play. Second, a recent
version of the economic theory of fertility
has been formulated largely in terms of
young adults (Easterlin, 1973). And third,
particularly salient in light of the second
point, no previous study I have reviewed
has attempted to test the economic theory
of fertility with this age category.

The independent variables used in the
analyses included male income (MI, the
indicator of the capability to purchase
children, expressed in terms of 1967 dollars in the analyses), female income (FI,
the indicator of the cost of children, also
expressed in terms of 1967 dollars in the
analyses), female educational level (ED),
urbanization (UR), per cent Black (%B),
per cent Catholic (%C), and population
density (PD). Detailed explanations of the
sources of data and the operationalization
of each of the variables in each of the
analyses follow. The reader will note that
data specific to the age category were
available for 20-24 year old male and

DeFronzo

Social Biology

female income, education, and urbanization in the U.S. censuses for 1950, 1960,
and 1970, while age-specific data were not
available for all of these points in time for
per cent Black, per cent Catholic, and
population density.

MALE INCOME (MI): (a) the median income of males 20-24 years old with income in 1949 for each state (U.S. Census
of the Population: 1950, Table 89); (b) the
same median for 1959 (U.S. Census of the
Population: 1960, Table 134); (c) the same
median for 1969 (U.S. Census of the Population: 1970, Table 193); (d) change in
male income from 1950 to 1960 was
defined as (b)—(a); and (e) change in female
income from 1960 to 1970 was defined as
(c)—(6). All medians were adjusted to
compensate for the effects of inflation by
being converted into 1967 dollars prior to
the analyses.

FEMALE INCOME (FI): (a) the median
income of females 20-24 years old with
income in 1949 for each state (U.S. Census
of the Population: 1950, Table 89); (0) the
same median for 1959 (U.S. Census of the
Population: 1960, Table 134); (c) the same
median for 1969 (U.S. Census of the Population: 1970, Table 193); (d) change in
female income from 1950 to 1960 was
defined as (b)—(a); and (e) change in female
income from 1960 to 1970 was defined as
(c}1{b). All medians were adjusted to
compensate for the effects of inflation by
being converted into 1967 dollars prior to
the analyses. (The median income of
females 20-24 years old in each state in
1960 correlated at 0.98 with the female
wage rate of women 20-24 years old per
state in 1960 as calculated in the manner
prescribed by Cain and Weininger, 1973,
p. 223.)

EDUCATION (ED): (a) the median years
of all types of schooling for all females
20-24 years old was used in the 1950
cross-sectional and the 1950-60 change
analyses (U.S. Census of the Population:

 

 

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

Vol. 23, No. 3

1950, Table 64); (6) the median years of all
types of schooling for females 20-24 years
old not currently enrolled in school was
used in the 1960 and 1960-70 change
analyses (U.S. Census of the Population:
1960, Table 102); (c) the median years of
all types of schooling for all females 20-24
years old was used in the 1970 crosssectional analysis (U.S. Census of the
Population: 1970, Table 148).

URBANIZATION (UR): (a) the per cent of
females 20-24 years old living in urban
places (according to the 1960 census definition of “urban”), obtained by dividing the
number of women 20-24 years old living
in urban places in 1950 by the total number of women 20-24 years old in the state
in 1950 (U.S. Census of the Population:
1960, Table 16); (b) the same per cent calculated for 1960 (U.S. Census of the Population: 1960, Table 16); (c) the same per
cent calculated for 1970 data (U.S. Census
of the Population: 1970, Table 48); (d)
change in urbanization from 1950 to 1960
was defined as (6) — (a); and (e) change in
urbanization from 1960 to 1970 was
defined as (c) — (0).

PER CENT BLACK (%B): (a) the number
of Black women in a state in 1950 (agespecific data was available in terms of
“Non-white,” but not Blacks both for the
1950 and 1960 census; therefore, non-agespecific data for Blacks was used) was divided by the total number of women in the
state (U.S. Census of the Population:
1950, Table 14); (b) the same per cent was
calculated from 1960 data (U.S. Census of
the Population: 1960, Table 15); and (c)
the same per cent was calculated from
1970 data (U.S. Census of the Population:
1970, Table 48).

PER CENT CATHOLIC (%C): (a) the
number of Roman Catholics in a state in
1953 divided by the population of the state
in 1953 (the data was not age- or sexspecific and had not been collected for any
year closer to 1950 than 1953, National

Economic Theory of Fertility

229

Catholic Almanac: 1954, pp. 193, 194, and
the Statistical Abstract of the United
States for 1955); (6) the number of Roman
Catholics in a state in 1959 divided by the
population of the state in 1959 (National
Catholic Almanac: 1960, pp. 235-237 and
the Statistical Abstract of the United
States for 1960); (c) the number of Roman
Catholics in a state in 1969 divided by the
number of people in the state in 1969 (National Catholic Almanac: 1970, pp. 525—
527, and the Statistical Abstract of the
United States for 1970).

POPULATION DENsITy (PD): (a) the
natural logarithm of population per square
mile in each state in 1950; (b) the same for
1960; and (c) the same for 1970 data (all
information on population density was obtained from the Statistical Abstract of the
United States for 1970, Table 12). Since
scatter plot analysis indicated that the
very high population densities of several
states resulted in somewhat of a curvilinear relationship between population
density and children ever born to married
women aged 20-24, it was necessary to use
the natural logarithm of population density in the regression analyses in order not
to violate the assumption of linearity (as
suggested by Blalock, pp. 408-410, 1972).

CHILDREN EVER BORN TO EVERMARRIED WOMEN AGED 20-24 (CEBM):
(a) children ever born to ever-married
women aged 20-24 in 1950 (Fertility, U.S.
Census of the Population: 1950, Vol. IV,
Part 5, Chapter C, Table 32); (6) the same
rate was used for 1960 (U.S. Census of the
Population: 1960, Table 113); (c) the same
rate was used for 1970 (U.S. Census of the
Population: 1970, Table 161); (d) change
in CEBM from 1950 to 1960 was defined
as (b) — (a); and (e) change in CEBM from
1960 to 1970 was defined as (c) — (6).

CHANGE ANALYSES

Two of the regressions performed in this
study, as explained above, utilize change

230

in children ever born to ever-married
women aged 20-24 as the dependent variable. Among the independent variables,
male and female income and urbanization
were entered into the regressions as
change variables. The use of change scores
for male and female income seems a logical necessity; since the economic theory of
fertility claims that changes in capability
to purchase children and in the cost of
children cause changes in fertility. Urbanization was included in the change
analyses as a change rather than as a level
variable since, in the absence of any
theoretical or empirical reason for an alternative course, it seemed most logical to
utilize change in an independent variable
to explain change in a dependent variable.
Furthermore, experimental regression
analyses indicated that the initial level of
urbanization (at the beginning of the period of change for which the analysis was
performed) had absolutely no effect on
change in fertility, while change in urbanization did.

Four of the independent variables used
in the change analysis regressions, however, were entered at their initial levels at
the outset of the periods, rather than as
changes in levels during the periods, for
the following reasons. First, population
density has been viewed theoretically as
an inhibitor of population growth. Thus,
during the 1950-60 period (generally a period of increasing fertility, although fertility actually peaked in 1957), the population densities of the states were expected to
act as differential restraining influences on
fertility increase. And during the 1960—70
period of general decline in fertility, population density was expected to act as a
differential facilitator of the trend. Therefore, it seemed most appropriate to use the
initial level of population density in the
change analyses.

Educational level, per cent Black, and
per cent Catholic were included in the

DeFronzo

Social Biology

change regressions as initial level rather
than change scores in part because data
from the National Fertility Studies of 1965
and 1970 (Ryder and Westoff, 1971;
Ryder, 1973) indicated that all three of
these factors were associated with inability
to maintain control over fertility. Also,
Cutright (1973) has shown that improved
health conditions during the 1940-68 period has evidently caused an involuntary
increase in the fertility of Blacks and of
poorly educated people. Thus, it is likely
that states with large segments of their
populations poorly educated and/or Black
and/or Catholic would be inclined to experience greater than average increases in
fertility during the 1950-60 period and
would be less capable of following the
trend toward lower fertility during the
1960-70 period.

Furthermore, change in these three variables during the two ten-year periods was
negatively correlated to their initial levels
in five out of six cases. That is, using
change in these variables would greatly
misrepresent the degree to which a state’s
population was poorly educated, Black, or
Catholic.

Finally, and perhaps most significantly,
the main role of the noneconomic variables in this study was to purge the
economic variables, male and female income, of contamination with the effects of
noneconomic factors on fertility. In alternate exploratory regressions in which
either changes or initial levels in education, per cent Black, and per cent Catholic
were used, the results yielded with initial
levels were in much greater agreement
with theorized expectations for all variables in the analyses. Also, the amount of
variation in change in fertility explained
was somewhat higher.

One additional aspect of the change
analyses should be explained before moving to a consideration of the results.
Bohrnstedt (1969) has shown that the
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

Vol. 23, No. 3

amount and direction of change in a variable from one point of time to another
tends to be negatively related to the level
of that variable at the beginning of the
period of change. That is, the higher the
level of a variable at the outset of a period
of time, the lower the amount of increase
(or the greater the amount of decrease) in
the level of the variable during the period.
This tendency, long observed by students
of change phenomena, may be due to an
inclination to regress toward the mean or
to the fact that the level of a variable at the
beginning of a period might already be
close to some upper or lower bound
(unique to the nature of the particular variable). Thus, Bohrnstedt concluded that it
is necessary to control for the initial levels
of dependent variables in change analyses.

One method of accomplishing such a
control within the mode of a multivariate
regression analysis is the inclusion of the
initial level of the dependent variable in
the regression equation. Bohrnstedt (1974)
considered this procedure the only plausible approach in the change analyses attempted in this study, since more than two
independent variables were used in the
regressions. Other potential methods for
controlling for the initial-level effects on
the change in a dependent variable become unmanageably complicated once
there are more than two or three independent variables involved. The results of the
change analyses performed in this study
indicate that the procedure worked effectively and was necessary, since in both of
the change regressions the initial level of
the dependent variable exerted a strong
independent negative effect on change in
fertility (see Table 1).

RESULTS

The results of the regression analyses
are presented in Table 1. The first row of
the table contains the unstandarized re

gression coefficients (b’s) and the standardized regression coefficients (beta’s) for the
analysis which used the 1950 cross-sectional data. The second through fifth rows
of the table contain the results for the regressions which utilized change data for
the 1950-60 period, cross-sectional data
for 1960, change data for the 1960-70 period, and cross-sectional data for 1970, respectively.

Among the noneconomic variables used
in the regressions, only education came
close to being significantly related to fertility in the predicted negative direction
throughout all five analyses. The relationship was statistically significant at the 0.05
level in four of the five regressions, while
for the 1950-60 change analysis education
seemed to have no effect. The other noneconomic variables were even less consistently related to fertility at statistically
significant levels of probability. Nevertheless, since in all the analyses subsets of the
noneconomic variables were related to
fertility at acceptable levels of statistical
significance, their inclusion in the regressions probably did purge the male and
female income variables of contamination
with the effects on fertility of noneconomic
covariates.

Male income (the indicator of the capability to purchase children) was, as predicted by the economic theory, positively
related to fertility in all five of the regressions, although statistical significance at
the 0.05 level was not achieved for the
1950-60 change analysis (the probability
of this finding being due to chance was less
than 0.2). Female income (the indicator of
the cost of children) was consistently
negatively related to fertility, also in conformity with the predictions of economic
theory. The relationships were all significant at the 0.05 level, except for the
1960-70 change analysis (6 < 0.1). With
the exception of the 1960-70 regression,
the standardized regression coefficients

(beta’s) for male and female income indicate that female income was the more important determinant of fertility. During
the 1960-70 period of declining fertility,
however, it seemed that male income was
the more influential of the two.

The analyses also reveal that male income seemed to have exerted a relatively
constant effect on marital fertility throughout the 1950-70 period. The average unstandardized regression coefficient for
male income for the five regression
analyses was 0.072 (with male income always expressed in terms of 1967 dollars).
Thus, the combined analyses lead to the
tentative conclusion that a hundred dollar
increase in the income of males 20~-24
years old tended to cause an increase of
approximately seven children ever born to
each thousand married women aged 20-24
during the twenty-year period. The effect
of female income seemed to shift in magnitude during the 1950-70 period and was
weakest during the 1960—70 interval of
general decline in marital fertility.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

The present study tested the economic
theory of fertility by estimating similar regression equations with five separate sets
of data for the 48 contiguous states of the
United States. The analyses were exclusively directed at explaining the marital
fertility of women 20-24 years old, a group
whose fertility has not been studied in
previous multivariate regression examinations of the economic theory of fertility.
The results provided evidence that the effects of noneconomic variables on fertility
were not stable thoughout the twenty-year
period from 1950 to 1970. In particular, it
may be noted that per cent Black, per cent
Catholic, and population density exercised

Economic Theory of Fertility

their predicted effects on fertility during
the 1950-60 change analysis, a period of
general increase in the fertility rate, while
education and urbanization manifested
their anticipated negative effects on fertility in the 1960-70 change regression, a
period of general decline in fertility.

Female income exerted its predicted
negative effect on fertility in all five
analyses. Furthermore, female income
was a more important determinant of fertility than male income in all regressions
except the 1960-70 change analysis. Male
income had a consistently positive impact
on fertility. The results for female and
male income are particularly interesting in
that similar effects were exerted on fertility in the two change analyses even though
these variables were explaining deviation
about opposite-directioned trends in the
two ten-year periods.

Given the fact that the present study
confirms the anticipated effects of the
economic variables for three sets of crosssectional data (1950, 1960, 1970) and two
sets of change data (1950-60, 1960-70),
significant new support has been provided
for the historical validity of the economic
theory of fertility during the 1950-70 period in the United States.
