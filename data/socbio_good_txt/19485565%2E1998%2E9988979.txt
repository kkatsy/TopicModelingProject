ABSTRACT: Information on abortion is limited and inaccurate, especially in the developing
world, which has fed to speculation on the prevalence of abortion in these regions. A rise in
prevalence of abortion is mostly counted in terms of increase in the prevalence of induced abortions which reflects on the reproductive health of women. With the growing concern for the reproductive health of women, the study of abortion has drawn the attention of researchers worldwide. This paper is an attempt to assess the induced abortion potential among Indian women by
utilizing information on proportion of unwanted and ill-timed pregnancies obtained through
National Family Health Survey, India. This exercise may facilitate a better understanding of the
exact prevalence of induced abortion, which necessarily should be less than the estimated poten
tial depending on the levels of unwanted and ill-timed fertility.

The demographic implications of induced
abortions have been studied to facilitate an
understanding of their effect on fertility and
population growth. Family-planning program managers have used induced abortion
rates to gauge the need for contraceptive services. However, the public health implications of induced abortions have only recently
gained the attention of policy makers. Abortions in clandestine or otherwise unsafe conditions expose women to risk of mortality
and morbidity (Khanna et al., 1994). When
access to safe abortion services is limited,
abortion complications account for a significant proportion of admissions into gynecological wards (Mpangile et al., 1993). Research on induced abortions has revived in
the wake of this and other evidence indicating that induced abortions have been a major
cause of maternal deaths in the developing
world, with abortion-related complications
accounting for nearly half of all maternal
deaths (Dixon-Muller, 1990; Royston and
Armstrong, 1989; Royston, 1991).

In most developing countries, the characteristics of women resorting to abortion
or its consequences to their health remain
unknown. Information collected in this
context from surveys are said to be incomplete, despite the simplicity in defining an induced abortion, mostly because
women do not tend to report induced
abortions. If an abortion is reported at all,
it is more likely to be categorized as a
spontaneous abortion rather than as an induced one. This effect has been noticed in
several surveys world-wide (WHO, 1978).

The National Family Health Survey,
1992, conducted in 25 states in India collected information on the characteristics
of women who ever experienced an abortion according to type (spontaneous and
induced) and the “wanted” nature and
timing of the pregnancies. This survey
provides a unique opportunity to assess
indirectly the potential for induced abortion among Indian women. This information has been used earlier to measure in

directly the prevalence of induced abortions (Huntington et al., 1996).

The role of family planning programs
in India has been transformed by shifting
from being merely one providing contraceptives to one which is more integrated,
including providing safe abortion services
and helping couples restrict ill-timed and
unwanted pregnancies, thereby controlling levels of maternal mortality. Ever
since induced abortions were legalized
with minimal restrictions by the Medical
Termination of Pregnancy act, 1971
(Sarkar, 1977), the number of centers offering MTP services has been increasing
over the years (Govt. of India, 1994).

While induced abortion has been an
important factor responsible for fertility
decline in industrialized countries, it does
not seem to have made a significant contribution toward fertility decline in India.
However, in the Indian context, the potential for induced abortions should not
be judged from the perspective of fertility
decline, but rather from the dynamics of
contraceptive acceptance.

It is evident that for a substantial proportion of couples in India, sterilization is
the first ever-used method of contraception
(IPS, 1995). Such couples may have felt a
need to limit their family sizes much earlier in the family building process or even
to adjust the timing of the births, which
may have resulted in the use of induced
abortions. Contraceptive failure also contributes to the use of induced abortion.
There is evidence to suggest that increases
in contraceptive use go hand in hand with
increases in induced abortion, indicating
the contribution of possible contraceptive
failures.

Estimates on the prevalence of abortions (both induced and spontaneous)
have been scarce. Given the fact that gov
Induced Abortion Potential 279

ernment records do not cover the phenomenon exhaustively, there is a need for alternative estimates to gauge its prevalence. The trivial proportion of abortions
(spontaneous and induced) reported in
surveys clearly indicates a large extent of
under-reporting with respect to induced
abortion (Barreto et al., 1992; Casterline,
1989; Jones and Forrest, 1992).

Induced abortions may be reported as
spontaneous abortions in order to avoid admitting morally unacceptable actions. Illegal abortions of a premarital and sex-selective nature are carried out in the private
sector and never enter the record. Therefore, the abortion phenomenon in India is
largely disguised due to incomplete and
limited data availability. India’s actual abortion rate is probably about two to five times
the reported rate of 3 abortions per 1,000
women, since only a fraction of the abortions, that is, those performed in registered
nursing homes and government facilities,
are reported (Henshew, 1990). A large proportion of the abortions that go unreported
may have been performed without any
medical supervision, thus increasing the
risk of secondary infections/complications
for the women undergoing such procedures.

The National Family Health Survey
(NFHS) (IIPS, 1995) indicates a very low
prevalence of abortion among Indian
women. The percentage of pregnancies
reported as aborted varies between 3.7 per
cent in Madhya Pradesh to 10.3 per cent
in Tamil Nadu. Using these proportions of
pregnancy wastage and Crude Birth Rates
(CBR’s), we can make a simple estimate
of abortion per thousand live births that
varies between 36.4 in Andhra Pradesh to
131.4 in Tamil Nadu. Based on this number of reported abortions, the consequent
influence of abortion on fertility is bound
to be meager.

ABORTION IN INDIA:
AN OVERVIEW

Official estimates of the annual incidence of induced abortion are limited to
the statistics provided by the Ministry of
Health and Family Welfare, which accounts for the reported MTP cases performed in the government’s recognized
clinics. However, several unofficial estimates of induced abortion in India indicate an increasing trend from 3.9 million
in 1966 (Shah Committee) to 6.7 million
by Chhabra et al. (1994).

These estimates are based on a varied
set of assumptions. For instance, the Shah
Committee assumed 73 live births, 2 stillbirths, and 25 abortions (15 induced and
10 spontaneous) per every 100 pregnancies. With similar assumptions, the recent
estimate by Chhabra et al. (1994) finds
6.7 million induced and 4.5 million spontaneous abortions. Further, IPPF (1970)
estimates of 6.5 million illegal abortions
in India is based on an abortion ratio of
200:1000 known pregnancies which results in an abortion rate of about 55:1000
for women aged 15-44 years. Besides,
other individual estimates by Karkal
(1991) indicate 3 illegal abortions per one
legal abortion and 4—5 illegal abortions
for every MTP in urban areas.

With several estimates at hand, it ts
difficult to assess the exact prevalence of
induced abortions. It may be worthwhile
at this juncture to have an assessment of
the potential for induced abortion among
Indian women, as an alternative to the existing guesstimates, which are based on
varied sets of assumptions.

As the prevalence of abortion increases,
induced abortion takes up a larger share of
total abortions. Spontaneous abortions are
more often associated with biological char

acteristics of women (Nortman, 1974;
WHO, 1970). Nulliparous women, women
getting pregnant in the high-risk age categories (less than 20 years and above 35
years of age), multiparous women and
women with shorter birth intervals are
prone to spontaneous abortions (Awan,
1975). In general, there is a biological
limit on the proportion of spontaneous
abortions in any population, which can at
best account for a limited and more or less
constant proportion of pregnancies (Bongaart and Potter, 1983). In a low fertility
situation, with better access to maternal
care, the incidence of spontaneous abortions would be low. Even in a high fertility
situation, it can not account for a significant proportion of total abortions. Increases, if any, in the abortion rate would
always be due to induced abortions.

The potential for induced abortion
rises mainly due to unintended pregnancies. Couples may exceed their desired
number of children either due to non-contraceptive reasons or due to non-use of
contraception. Alternatively, couples who
desire additional children may be faced
with an ill-timed pregnancy. Thus, on the
whole, both ill-timed and unwanted pregnancies run the risk of being the potential
cases for induced abortions.

It should be kept in mind that the reporting of ill-timed and unwanted births .
are subject to some biases. A birth may
be reported as ill-timed depending on the
possible adverse situation prevailing in
the household at the time of the birth. A
birth could become unwanted by not being of the desired sex. Not all unwanted
and ill-timed births are due to contraceptive failure or an unmet need for effective
contraception. On the other hand, the
wrong timing of a desired pregnancy
might result in an induced abortion. This

is not to say that all unintended pregnancies result in induced abortions, but rather
that they have a fair chance of being
aborted voluntarily. The reporting of illtimed and unwanted pregnancies has a
strong association with the likelihood of
abortion. In fact, the phenomenon of illtimed/unwanted pregnancy was used as a
filter question to identify the incidence of
induced abortion accurately (Huntington
et al., 1996).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

ASSESSING INDUCED ABORTION POTENTIAL BASED ON INFORMATION ON ILLTIMED AND UNWANTED PREGNANCIES

Using the information on the per cent
of pregnancies that resulted in live births
by age and the age-specific fertility rates
(ASFR’s), we derived age-specific pregnancy rates (ASPR’s) for the 15 major
states in India. These ASFR’s and the
proportion of pregnancies resulting in
live births are presented in Table 1. The
resultant ASPR’s are products of the agespecific fertility rates and the reciprocal
of the per cent of the pregnancies resulting in live births (Table 2). The ASPR’s
can be understood as the number of
women out of a group of 1,000 in that
age category who will conceive in that
year, a definition similar to that given for
ASFR’s.

Thus,
ASPR, = ASFR,; * (1/PLB,)

where, ASPR’s are the age-specific pregnancy rate for age 1, ASFR is the age-specific fertility rate, and PLB, is the percentage of live births to total pregnancies
in the i-th age category.

Induced Abortion Potential 281

Out of the number of women who are
likely to be pregnant, only those women
with pregnancies that were ill-timed and
unwanted have the potential to be aborted,
and those proportions are given in Table
3. The number of women who run this
risk of being potential abortees over the
quinquenial age groups can be measured
as the product of the ASPR’s and the proportion of women having ill-timed and
unwanted pregnancies in that age category. The sum of these age-specific potential induced abortion rates (ASPIAR) over
the five-year age groups multiplied by 5
gives the total potential induced abortion
rate (TPIAR). The computation of TPIAR
is Similar to the computation of the TFR;
but instead of the ASFR’s used for TFR,
we used ASPIAR’s.

ASPIAR, = ASPR, * PWIUP,

where ASPIAR, is the age-specific potential induced abortion rate for age “i”; ASPR, is the age-specific pregnancy rate,
and PWIUP, is the proportion of women
having ill-timed or unwanted pregnancies
in the age group “i,” and hence,

TPIAR = 5 > ASPIAR,

i=]

The ASPIAR’s and the associated
TPIAR’s for the 15 major states are given
in Table 4. This TPIAR can be explained
in terms of average expected potential
number of induced abortion per women
under the given schedule of fertility and
age pattern of ill-timed and unwanted
pregnancies.

Using these estimates of abortion potential per women in reproductive ages,
we also computed the potentials for induced abortion for pregnancies which is
given in Table 6. These potential induced

In an attempt to find alternative means
of obtaining information about induced
abortions when reported data is inadequate, researchers have used filter questions followed by more specific nonstigmatizing questions to elicit data on
induced abortions (Anderson et al., 1994;
Huntington et al., 1993). The Huntington

 

 

et al. (1993) study used the “unwanted status” of any previous pregnancy to dwell
upon the issues of induced abortion. About
65 per cent of women who had an unwanted pregnancy tried to or obtained an
induced abortion.

An evaluation of similar studies using
Demographic Health Survey (DHS) data
on induced abortion and alternative questions to obtain information from the DHS
concluded that abortions are more likely

the sum of the product of the projected
female population and the ASPIAR for
each age category. It should be remembered that this is simply an exercise to indicate the possible number of induced
abortions. We can not lay claim to any
degree of accuracy.

The potential abortion in a particular
year, say “t,” will be:

A, = ASPIAR,, * W,,

where ASPIART = age-specific potential
induced abortion rate for i-th age group
in the year ¢ and W,, is the number of
women in i-th age group in year “ft.”

The Huntington et al. (1996) study
found that when the reported levels of unwanted pregnancies were high, and the atmosphere around induced abortions was
restrictive, as in Egypt, Ghana, and Cote
dIvoire, then 25, 55, and 65 per cent of
the women, respectively, who reported unwanted pregnancies attempted an abortion.

In India, abortions have been legally
available since 1972. It can be assumed
that except for some segments of the population the atmosphere regarding abortion is not too restrictive. It can therefore
be assumed that at least a third of those
women who had an unwanted/ill-timed
pregnancy in India would attempt an
abortion, based on the observation made
by Huntington et al. (1996). Even at the
modest level of conversion of unwanted
pregnancies to induced abortions, the estimated number of abortions far exceed
the reported number (see Table 7).

DISCUSSION

The number of births reported as illtimed and unwanted has been used to
compute potential abortion rates by age
for the fifteen major states in India. Usually there is a reluctance on the part of
women to report a birth that has already
occurred as unwanted. Therefore, the per

Vol. 45, No. 3-4

centage of such births stated as ill-timed
and unwanted are likely to be underestimates, and the rates for potential abortion
will be affected accordingly. The distribution of ill-timed and unwanted births indicates that unwanted births occur mostly
for women above 30 years of age, and illtimed births are concentrated more among
younger women (IIPS, 1995). With advancing age, women will achieve their desired family size and composition, while
younger women are expected to have illtimed pregnancies. This finding is in
keeping with the age characteristics of
couples with unmet need for contraception. As can be seen from Table 2, the
proportion of ill-timed births ranges from
5.7 per cent in Gujarat to 26.9 per cent in
Karnataka, while the proportions of unwanted births are much lower, ranging between 2.4 in Kerala and 15.3 in West Bengal. Further, as the total demand for
family planning in the spacing category
remains largely unmet, it is likely that this
unmet demand for spacing results in potential candidates for induced abortion.
The total potential for abortion is the
highest in Uttar Pradesh and the lowest in
Gujarat. The peak ages in abortion potential are achieved at the same time as the
peak in ASFR, i.e., in 20-24 age group in
10 out of 14 major states. For Assam, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, and Uttar
Pradesh, this peak is achieved in the age
group 25-29. It can be seen that this potential abortion rate is a reflection of the fertility levels and the level of unmet demand
for spacing and limiting services. The rate
is high in states like Uttar Pradesh, which
have the combination of a high level of fertility and a high level of unmet demand for
family planning. The rate is low in states
like Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, and
Kerala which represent a combination of

relatively lower fertility levels and lower
levels of unmet demand, especially for limiting services (see Table 5). It can also be
seen that the potential abortion rate is high
in states like West Bengal where the met
demand for spacing is relatively high and
the fertility level is also relatively high.
Thus, it can be said that the TPIAR depends extensively on the unmet demand
for limiting, clearly indicating that the potential for abortion is high when the demand for limiting services remains largely
unmet. This finding is further confirmed by
obtaining correlation between the TPIAR
and the per cent of couples satisfied with
spacing and limiting services, which was
—0.0475 and —0.6826, respectively.
While the probability of a pregnancy
having the potential for induced abortion
is relatively high in the three diverse
states of West Bengal, Assam, and Karnataka and the lowest in Rajasthan and
Gujarat, this probability increases with
age for all the states except for Kerala
and Maharashtra where it assumes an inverted V-shape. In spite of the fact that
there 1s a larger percentage of couples
with unmet need for spacing than limiting, the TPIAR’s and the potential for induced abortion per pregnancy are heavily
influenced by the percentage of couples
whose need for limiting services has been
met. There is a clear negative relationship
between these two, indicating that the potential for induced abortion is higher if the
percentage of couples whose need for limiting services being met is low. It can be
seen that the magnitude for correlations is
smaller when the potential for induced
abortion per pregnancy is used instead of
TPIAR. This observation indicates that
even if adjustments are made on the levels
of fertility across states, the impact of
unmet need for limiting still remains.

4PIAP denotes Potential Induced abortion per pregnancy which is obtained by dividing TPIAR by TPR.

In terms of the induced abortion potential per pregnancy, we found that the potential for induced abortion is highest in
West Bengal, followed by Karnataka and
Assam, and that Uttar Pradesh shifted

was considered was a reflection of the

expected to decline with improved access
to limiting services and overall improvement in the quality of family planning services for spacing as well. This expectation
is in keeping with the present agenda of
Family Welfare Programme in India which
is shifting from a target-oriented approach
to a responsive, felt-needs, RCH-reproductive, and child-health approach.

In the states of Kerala and Maharashtra, one finds that the estimates of induced abortions almost match the reported ones. In Gujarat, Haryana, and
Punjab, the estimated rate of induced
abortions is twice that of the reported,
while in Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu, it is
slightly over two-times the reported ones.
In other states, the estimated number of
abortions is more than twice that reported

in the Family Welfare Year Book (Govt of
India), sometimes as much as ten times
the reported number. This finding is
clearly indicative of two problems: (1)
The reported number of induced abortions (MTP’s) per government sources
are definite underestimates; (2) The existing abortion facilities are not sufficient to
meet the potential needs for induced
abortion which is several times higher
than the reported ones. It also suggests
that there is a high volume of unwanted
pregnancies, either due to lack of use of
contraception or due to failure of the contraceptive used. These findings point toward the inadequacy of existing family
planning and birth-preventing facilities,
in terms of quality or quantity, or perhaps
both.
