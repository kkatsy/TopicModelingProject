Methodological Options in Measuring

INegitimacy and the Difference
They Make

Despite its potential social and demographic significance, illegitimate fertility is
a difficult subject to study. There is not
only the problem of identifying illegitimate
births, but also the problem of estimating
accurately the population exposed to the
risk of illegitimate childbearing. We will
discuss both of these problems on the basis
of experience gained in a joint research
project between the University of California, Berkeley, and the California State
Department of Health. In this paper, we
wish to present some of the methodological
problems that emerged while developing
illegitimacy data for California and the
United States, report several studies we
made in order to evaluate the California
data, and make comparisons between our
estimates for the United States and those
prepared by the National Center for Health
Statistics.

DETERMINING ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS
IN CALIFORNIA
The term “illegitimate,” when applied to
children, offends many people because it

lation and Urban Research, 2234 Piedmont Avenue, Berkeley, California 94720.

seems to stigmatize children for something
beyond their control. For this reason many
states, including California, have eliminated
the term “illegitimate” from the birth certificate and a large vocabulary of substitute
terms has developed. As we have discussed
elsewhere, there is nothing wrong with such
terms as “children of unmarried mothers”
and “out-of-wedlock children,” although
these terms tend to be cumbersome (Mulligan et al., 1974). More important, when
the word “illegitimate” is tabooed, the assumption is that little more than moral
stigma is involved. Our view is that the
handicaps suffered today by illegitimate
children result not so much from the moral
opprobrium attached to the label “illegitimate” as from the circumstances in which
the children are reared (Sklar and Berkov,
1974a; Cutright et al., 1974). Thus, removing the word “illegitimate” does not eliminate the phenomenon itself. What is crucial
in any study of illegitimacy is to be able to
identify illegitimate children, not for the
purposes of attributing stigma, but rather
to investigate their number and characteristics and what happens to them in later life.

record, data with respect to illegitimacy in
California cannot be obtained except by
inferring the information from what is
stated on the birth certificate. Such an
inferential method was developed in California in the late 1950’s and early 1960’s
by several large local health departments
and was applied on a statewide basis beginning in 1966 (Berkov and Shipley,
1971). The method provided criteria for
dividing birth certificates into two groups:
those apparently out-of-wedlock and those
apparently legitimate. The classification
was based mainly on a comparison of the
surname of the child with the surnames of
the parents, including consideration of the
name given by the mother when she signs
the birth certificate as the informant for
the birth record.

For representative samples of births
classified illegitimate in 1967 and 1970,
we reviewed the coding of the certificates

and compiled data on the frequency with
which each criterion had been applied
(Berkov, unpublished). Our findings were
very similar for both 1967 and 1970 (see
Table 1). In both years, approximately
one-fifth of the certificates were classified
out-of-wedlock because the father’s name
had been omitted. This omission was much
more frequent for white than for Black
births reflecting the fact that white babies
were more frequently adopted. For about
an additional one-fourth of the sample, the
mother had named a father, but she had
given the child her own surname rather
than that of the man she named (again,
more often for white than for Black). For
approximately half the cases, the mother
had named a father and had given his name
to the child. In these cases, the certificate
had been classified out-of-wedlock because
the mother had signed it either with her
maiden name (almost two-fifths of the

sample) or with a current married name
indicating that she was divorced, widowed,
or possibly separated (12 per cent of the
sample). The very large proportion of cases
in California in which the mother gives the
baby the same surname as the father probably results from a state attorney general’s
opinion dating from 1945 which specifies
that a mother may give to her child any
surname she wishes. In California, hospitals
frequently either inform unwed mothers of
this attorney general’s opinion or they may
deliberately refrain from giving any advice

to the mother in regard to naming the child. |

In undertaking to use the California data
on illegitimacy in our research, we had to
make an initial judgment that the inferential criteria as applied to birth certificates
probably were valid and were not either
missing large numbers of illegitimate births
(false negatives) or identifying large numbers of legitimate births as illegitimate
(false positives). Visits to local health departments and hospitals and several pilot
studies provided initial evidence that the
inferential method was probably not producing overestimates of the number of illegitimate births (Berkov and Shipley, 1971,
p. 4).

In investigating various means to check
more systematically the accuracy of the inferential method, we found that a number
of hospitals.in the state either compiled
their own counts of illegitimate births or
maintained logs of deliveries that could be
used to compile such counts. We concluded
that the best test of the validity of the
inferential method used in California would
be to compare, for as many of these hospitals as possible, the number of illegitimate
births shown by hospital records with the
number obtained by application of the
inferential method.

We were able to make such comparisons
for six hospitals (see Table 2). It is clear

Social Biology

that there is some variation among hospitals, as one would expect, but the remarkable thing is the close overall agreement
between the two counts. For all hospitals
and time periods combined, the birth certificate method identified 13,311 illegitimate births or 27.9 per cent of the total
births, as compared to the hospital count
of 13,396 illegitimate births or 28.2 per
cent of total births.

The evidence indicated that there was
little misclassification of legitimate births
as illegitimate and that few illegitimate
births were missed. It appeared that the
information about the mother’s marital
status inferred from the birth certificate
corresponded to the information the mother
had given to the hospital for their own
records. Although it would be desirable to
have a larger sample of hospitals, and although there is need for future periodic
checks, the evidence obtained thus far indicates that the inferential method being
applied to birth certificates in California
is a valid procedure and is not overestimating the number of illegitimate births in the
State.

COUNTING ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS
IN THE UNITED STATES

One of the most important uses we made
of the inferential data for California was
to show that legal abortion had depressed
overall fertility, particularly illegitimate
fertility, in 1971. Extending this study to
other states, we focused on the period
1965-71 and compared the fertility experiences of states with and without legalized
abortion in 1970 (Sklar and Berkov,
1974d).

This interstate study of abortion and
nonabortion states faced two problems.
First, the birth data by legitimacy that
were available from the National Centerfor Health Statistics (NCHS) referred only
to states having a question about legitimacy

on the birth certificate, and California and
New York were among the nonreporting
states. Since California and New York accounted for most legal abortions performed
in the country in 1970 and 1971, it was
essential to obtain birth data by legitimacy
from these states (Center for Disease Control, n.d., p. 6; 1972, p. 3). The second
problem was that NCHS was delayed in
the preparation of birth data by legitimacy

for 1969 and later years. As a result, we
obtained the more recent data for the
interstate study by communicating directly
with.all states, including states that did not
have a legitimacy question on the birth
certificate but nonetheless used information
on the birth record to infer apparent legitimacy Status.

tailed tabulation. These states accounted
for 95.8 per cent of all United States births
in 1968. On the basis of the data from these
44 states, we developed estimates of birth
rates by legitimacy status for the United
States as a whole cross-classified by age,
race, geographical region, and availability
of lega] abortion in 1970. We have discussed the findings of this analysis in other
papers. Here we are concerned with methodological questions raised by our use of
a somewhat different procedure for estimating illegitimate births than that used by the
NCHS (Guerriero and Tsai, unpublished).

How does NCHS prepare an estimate for
the nation on the basis of states with a legitimacy question on the birth certificate?
In making the national estimates, NCHS
assumes that these states represent the entire geographical division. The number of
states with questions varies in different
years.’ In 1973, 38 states had a legitimacy
question on the birth certificate, but 12
States did not—California, Connecticut,
Georgia, Idaho, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Montana, New Mexico, New York, Ohio,
Vermont, and Nevada. The 12 nonreporting states contained over 30 per cent of the
nation’s births in 1973 (National Center
for Health Statistics, 1975, and unpublished data). In making the national estimates, NCHS assumes that the ratio of
illegitimate to total births is the same
within each geographical division for the
reporting and nonreporting states, taking
each race group separately (white and nonwhite for 1968 and earlier years; white,
Black, and other for 1969 and later years):

1 There were 16 nonreporting states in 1965-67,
10 in 1968, 11 in 1969~70 and 12 in 1971-73. Not
reporting for the entire period 1965-73 were California, Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Montana, New Mexico, New York
and Vermont. Not reporting in 1965~67 but reporting in 1968-73 were Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Nebraska, New Hampshire and Oklahoma.
Nevada reported in 1965-70, but discontinued re
porting in 1971-73; Ohio reported in 1965-68, but
discontinued reporting in 1969-73.

Social Biology

It should be noted that among the reporting states, the legitimacy question is
phrased differently in different states; most
states ask simply “Legitimate? (yes or
no),” while a few states phrase their question “Is mother married?” or “Is mother
married to father?” NCHS has not evaluated the accuracy with which the legitimacy
question has been answered in the reporting
states (Clague and Ventura, 1968, p. 1).
Probably, some illegitimate births are reported as legitimate.?

In this paper no attempt is made to
evaluate the validity of data from states
having a legitimacy question on the birth
certificate or to determine the amount of
error that might have been introduced into
the data for the 1940’s and 1950’s by the
NCHS assumption that reporting and nonreporting states in the same geographical
division are similar. Since about the mid1960’s, however, the large nonreporting
states have been applying inferential methods. Our studies incorporating the data
from these states show that in some geographical divisions at least, the assumed
similarity between reporting and nonreporting states is open to question, particularly in regard to the absolute number of
illegitimate births occurring each year.

In California, for example, application
of the NCHS method produces a figure substantially below the number obtained by
using the inferential method (see Figure 1
and Table 3).3 For 1973, the national total

2 Underreporting of illegitimate births was demonstrated in one study in the state of Washington
where most births are to white women (Washington State Department of Health, 1962). Underreporting has been said to be more frequent for
white than for Black births (Cutright, 1972,
p. 429).

3 This finding was in sharp contrast to what
the NCHS found in their evaluation study of one
month’s births in 1963. In this evaluation study,
NCHS developed inferential criteria from a sample of birth certificates in reporting states. These
criteria then were applied to birth records in the
nonreporting states; the number of illegitimate
births obtained by application of the inferential

according to NCHS would involve an allocation of 31,050 illegitimate births in California. This is 26 per cent less than the

criteria was compared to the number obtained by
application of the usual NCHS method (extending
the experience of the reporting states to the nonreporting states). This NCHS evaluation showed
that in the Pacific division, the inferential method
produced many less illegitimate births than the
usual NCHS procedure. In our study of California,
however, we found that using State Health Department inferential criteria produced larger numbers of illegitimate births than did the NCHS
usual procedure. The reason for this discrepancy
was that the illegitimacy criteria developed by
NCHS omitted the category of certificates in
which the child and father have the same surname
but the mother signs the certificate with a different surname (her maiden name or her current
married name). Although this category accounted
for half of all illegitimate births in California
(see earlier discussion), it had been relatively
infrequent in the sample of reporting states NCHS
used to develop inferential criteria for their evaluation study (Clague and Ventura, 168, p. 72).

41,851 illegitimate births obtained from
California by application of our method
(29 per cent less for whites and 20 per cent
less for nonwhites). The low estimates by
the NCHS method occur because in comparison to California, which is the only
nonreporting state in the Pacific division,
the reporting states have much lower illegitimacy ratios.

Application of the NCHS method to
New York State gives results similar to
those for California (see Figure 1 and
Table 4). For 1973, it allocates 33,113
illegitimate births to New York, which is
16 per cent less than the 39,345 estimated
by the inferential method. However, the
NCHS figure for 1973 was lower only for
whites (10,752 vs. 17,890); for nonwhites,

it was higher by a small amount (22,361
vs. 21,455), and it was also higher in 1971
and 1972, although lower in 1969 and 1970.
Evidently, the nonwhite experience of the
two reporting states in the middle Atlantic
division—Pennsylvania and New Jersey—

‘was not representative of New York in that

it failed to reflect the effect of New York’s
legal abortion law on nonwhite illegitimate
births in the state in 1971-73.

When the NCHS estimates by divisions
in 1965-71 are totaled to the United States

as a whole, they yield national figures for
illegitimate births well below our own estimates (see Figure 2 and Table 5). For
most years, they were 5 to 6 per cent below
our estimates. For every year in the 196571 period, the two methods produced a
greater discrepancy for whites than for
nonwhites. For whites, the NCHS method
showed less rise in illegitimate births between 1965 and 1970, and then less decline
in 1971, than did the figures that included
inferential data.

$ Per cent NCHS estimate is greater or less than inferential estimate.

This discrepancy probably occurred because the NCHS estimates excluded direct
evidence from New York, California, and
other nonreporting states where, compared
to reporting states, white illegitimate births
rose more rapidly in the late 1960’s and
then, as a result of legal abortion, declined
more sharply in 1971. For nonwhites, the
two methods showed approximately the
same relative rise in number of illegitimate
births between 1965 and 1970. However,
the NCHS method failed to reflect as much
dampening of the rise in 1971 by legal
abortion as did the figures using inferential
information. Finally, for all races combined,
the NCHS estimate of illegitimate births
showed a rise between 1970 and 1971, while
the inferential data showed a drop between
the two years.

 

Because the nonreporting states account
for a large proportion of all births in the
country in any one year, it is evident that
the incorporation of inferentially derived
information from these states produces a
more sensitive measure of illegitimacy
trends. When the problem is to evaluate
the impact of legal abortion on legitimate
and illegitimate fertility, as was the case in
our studies, it is éssential to include such
inferential evidence because many of the
nonreporting states have high legal abortion »
rates. For broader analysis of the trends,
the difference may be less important. On
the whole, although we have not evaluated
the inferential data from states other than
California, our validation of the California
information leads us to believe that national
estimates incorporating inferential data are

preferable to estimates based solely on the
experience of reporting states in the same
geographical area.

INCLUSION OF SEPARATED WOMEN
AS SUBJECT TO RISK

It is not only because of the failure to
use inferentially derived data that the
NCHS estimates of illegitimacy are low.
It is also because of the definition used in
those states that do report births by legitimacy. In such states, children of all married
women—including separated women regardless of whether the father of the child is
their husband—are considered legitimate.
From a strictly legal standpoint, separated
women are married, and their children are
presumed to be legitimate. We question,
however, whether a legal definition is appropriate. The main purpose of the legitimacy question on the birth certificate is to
obtain statistical information in order to
understand the social and economic circumstances in which the mother and child find
themselves when the child is born and their

Options in Measuring Illegitimacy

 

365

likely circumstances in the formative years
of the child’s life. As an indicator of these
circumstances, the purely legal definition
has little meaning. In the case of a separated woman having a baby by a man other
than her legal husband, the child may or
may not have a future relationship with the
biological father, but he is not likely to
have any relationship with the mother’s
legal husband.

Discussions with vital registration officials suggest that even though a number of
States specify in their registration manuals
a definition of illegitimacy that excludes
separated women, little is known about how
this definition is applied. Particularly in
urbanized areas of states with large Black
populations, it is possible that in completing birth certificates hospital staffs in practice tend to apply a sociologic rather than
a legal definition of legitimacy and thus to
report as illegitimate some births to separated women.‘

In 1966, when we first estimated illegitimacy for California, our aim was to approximate a sociologic definition which
considers as illegitimate those births in
which the mother was not married to the

father of the child (Davis, 1939). Discus
sions with local health department officials
and our review of certificates classified
“apparently illegitimate” led us to believe
that some separated women were having

4 The opposite conclusion that separated women
probably were not significantly represented in
counts of illegitimate births was drawn in a report
prepared for the Commission on Population
Growth and the American Future (Cutright, 1972,
p. 433). However, we question this conclusion on
several grounds: (1) The data used to support it
came only from one study of mothers of illegitimate babies born in North Carolina in 1960 and
1961. (2) In the study, information on marital
status at the time of birth was obtained only for
mothers who were located and interviewed and
one-third of the sample of Black mothers was not
located. (3) It was found that less than 10 per
cent of the Black mothers located and interviewed
were “previously married,” but no specific data
were given on the proportion separated by age
group.

babies by men other than their legal husbands and that since they frequently named
the other man as the father of the child
these births were being classified illegitimate. This finding raised the question of
how to calculate the illegitimate birth rate,
because the rate is strongly influenced by
inclusion or exclusion of separated women
(along with those single, widowed, and
divorced) in the population at risk.
Separated women comprise a large proportion of Black women in the childbearing
ages, particularly Black women age 25 and
over. In California in 1970, among Black
women aged 25~34, 13.6 per cent were
separated and 11.3 per cent were divorced.
The comparable figures for the United
States were 13.8 per cent and 6.4 per cent
(see Table 6). Inclusion of separated

women in the population at risk of illegitimate childbearing makes a substantial difference in Black birth rates. As is shown
below, it lowers the illegitimate rate ‘and
raises the legitimate one.

The suspicion that births to separated

Social Biology

women were being included in counts of
illegitimate births in California was confirmed by data we obtained as a by-product
of a study of high-risk pregnancies in three
hospitals in the San Francisco Bay Area.
In the three hospitals studied, records of
normal and complicated deliveries in 1973
were abstracted. From information in the
case record, the apparent legitimacy status
of the child was determined, using the same
definition of illegitimacy as is approximated
by the inferential method, i.e., that the
mother was not married to the father of the
child. For all cases classified illegitimate,
information from the hospital record was
obtained about the specific marital status
of the mother.

The sample consisted of 1,237 live births
of which 324 were classified illegitimate. As
shown in Table 7, among the mothers of
the illegitimate babies, we found that while
most (84 per cent) had never been married,
the percentage separated was almost as
large as the percentage divorced (7 per cent
vs. 8 per cent). Among the Black mothers
in the sample aged 25 and over, 17 per cent
were separated and 21 per cent divorced.
Thus, there seems little question that, at
least in California, separated women having
children by men other than their husbands
are being included in the counts of illegitimate births and therefore that separated
women cannot be excluded from the denominators that are used to calculate illegitimate birth rates.®

Another reason for our decision to consider separated women at risk in both ‘our

5 Separated women also may be having babies
by their legal husbands, although our contacts
with hospitals and our work with birth certificates
in California have not indicated that this is a
large group. It would be desirable in calculating
rates to distinguish between the two groups of
separated mothers and also to estimate the proportion of separated women in the population
who have lived apart from their husbands for
more than nine months and thus are not likely
to be at risk of having a legitimate child. At
present, however, these data are not available.

interstate study and our California estimates was the likelihood that some women
who have never been married but have had
a child may report themselves as separated
in the census and the Current Population
Survey (Shryock and Siegel, 1973). In
their calculation of illegitimate birth rates,
NCHS does not consider separated women
at risk, although they have indicated to us
that in future years they may do so for
special studies.

How much difference does it make in
illegitimate and legitimate birth rates if
separated women are included with the
unmarried? Our finding is that it makes
considerable difference (see Table 8). For
nonwhites in the whole country in 1970,
inclusion of the separated in the denominator lowers the illegitimate birth rate by
17 per cent and raises the legitimate rate
by 19 per cent, For ages 25-34, the difference is even greater. The illegitimate rate
is lowered by 33 per cent; the legitimate
rate, raised by 20 per cent. For Black

women aged 25-34 in California in 1970,
the two figures were 35 per cent and 23 per
cent. Thus, it appears that by excluding
separated women from the population at
risk, NCHS has probably overestimated the
magnitude of the nonwhite illegitimate
birth rate. As for white women, their rates
both in California and the United States
were much less affected by inclusion or
exclusion of the separated.

COMPARISON OF NCHS AND
STUDY RATES

So far we have discussed the numbers of
illegitimate births and the women exposed
to risk. How do the rates published by
NCHS compare with the rates estimated
in our interstate study for the years
1965-71?

Except for 1969 and 1970, the rates from
the two sources during 1965-71 were virtually the same for white women of all ages
(see Table 9). This similarity occurred because of compensating differences. AlDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

* Rates are illegitimate births per 1,000 unmarried women
and legitimate births per 1,000 married women. All illegitimate birth rates consider single, divorced, and widowed
women as unmarried and exposed to the risk of illegitimate
childbearing.

Rates were calculated by varying denominators but using
only one set of numerators. Births by legitimacy are published NCHS figures derived ea extending experience of reporting to nonreporting states. Denominators are 1970 census
figures. Rates in this table will differ slightly from those
published by NCHS (shown in Table 9) because NCHS
denominators are three-year moving averages of Current

it also used a smaller estimate of the population at risk by excluding the separated.
In 1969 and 1970, however, the NCHS
estimates failed to pick up particularly
sharp rises in illegitimacy that had occurred in nonreporting states. The maximum difference was in 1970 when our
rate was 14.5, or 4 per cent above the
NCHS rate of 13.9. Since the NCHS rates
showed less rise in illegitimacy in 1969
and 1970, they also showed less decline
in 1971 associated with the increased availability of legal abortion. Nevertheless, both
sets of rates showed the same trend—still
confining our attention to whites—before
and after 1970.

For the various age groups of white
women, our rates show no constant differences from those of NCHS. Our study rates
are higher for younger women, but lower
for older women. Among teenagers in 1970,
for example, the interstate study rate was
8 per cent above the comparable NCHS
rate (11.8 vs. 10.9), while for women aged
25~34, it was 3 per cent below the NCHS
figure (17.8 vs. 18.4). Our higher teenage
rates resulted from the larger number of
illegitimate births obtained by including
inferential data; but our lower rates at
older ages resulted from the inclusion of
separated women in the population at risk.
Although we counted more illegitimate
births for older white women, this fact was
more than compensated for by the inclusion
of separated women.

As for nonwhite women, our rates
throughout the 1965-71 period are lower
than the NCHS rates by 16 to 26 per cent,
mainly because we have treated separated
women as exposed to the risk of out-ofwedlock childbearing. Since the proportion
separated is particularly high among nonwhite women aged 25 and over, the discrepancy between our rates and those of
NCHS for this group is even greater. Our

rates are from 35 per cent to 55 per cent
less.

Turning now to the trends in nonwhite
illegitimacy, the two sets of rates are not
similar as they were for whites. While our
rates show an overall rise of 4 per cent in
nonwhite illegitimacy between 1965 and
1970, the NCHS rates show a decline of
8 per cent. The reasons for this discrepancy
are not entirely clear, but probably are
related to the different definitions of the
population at risk. Between 1970 and 1971,
the two sets of rates reversed direction and
thus continued to show opposite trends. In
1971, our rates dropped while the NCHS
rates rose. This divergence in trend in 1971
occurred because the NCHS used numera
tors that did not fully reflect the decline in
nonwhite illegitimate births associated with
legal abortion in New York and California
in 1971. Our study showed that nonwhite
women used legal abortion when it was
readily available in their state of residence,
but made much less use of out-of-state
abortion than did white women.

Thus, it appears that, in our studies at
least, incorporating inferential information
from nonreporting states and inclusion of
separated women in the population at risk
provided more sensitive indicators of the
impact of legal abortion on legitimate and
illegitimate fertility than would have been
possible using only the NCHS rates. We
believe our estimates approximate more

closely the actual incidence of out-ofwedlock childbearing. Further improvements in measuring illegitimacy could be
achieved if there were better understanding
and agreement about the practical and
analytic purposes to be served by the legitimacy question on the birth certificate.

It is likely that the legitimacy question
will be rephrased in order to drop the term
illegitimate. The next revision of the
standard certificate of live birth will
recommend that the question “Is mother
married?” replace the question “Legitimate? (yes or no).” In interpreting either
the new question or the old, considerable
confusion can be avoided by recognizing
that by whatever name it is called illegitimacy remains the same phenomenon and
data about it are needed to understand its
personal and social consequences. Because
illegitimate childbearing remains at high
levels in the United States, there is need
for continuing evaluation and improvement
of the data.
