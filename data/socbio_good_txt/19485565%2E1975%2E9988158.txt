A Method of Computing Period Rates of
Spinsterhood and Childlessness from
Census Data Applied to the United States

Prithwis Das Gupta

International Population and Urban Research
University of California
Berkeley, California

Questions on marital status and number
of children ever born to ever-married
women were asked in the last four decennial censuses of the United States. The
answers give an excellent opportunity to
study the changes in marriage and fertility of American women over a period of
more than thirty years. The changes for
white and nonwhite women considered
separately are particularly interesting because these two groups traditionally have
shown different patterns of reproductive
behavior.

In this paper, I shall explore only two
facets of fertility—nonmarriage and childlessness—for white and nonwhite women.
It is necessary, however, to avoid mistaken interpretations of the data and to
utilize the best techniques available for
cohort analysis. Unless care is exercised,
one may think that the census data show
that white women have increasingly been
marrying and that childlessness among
them has been decreasing. For nonwhite
women, the data seem to show an even
more drastic drop in childlessness but a
slow increase in the percentage of women
who remain single (Tables 1 and 3).

 

These conclusions based on figures in census reports are correct only if we accept
them as describing cohorts. They do not
tell us about marriage or fertility in the
census years. For instance, the proportion
of women aged 45 in the “ever-married’’
category in 1970 gives a cumulative thirtyyear picture of the cohort born in 1925.
Their proportion ever-married is obviously not determined by the age-specific
first-marriage rates of women in 1970,
but rather by the cohort rates during all
the years before that back to 1940. To
obtain a picture of the 1970 situation, one
has to think in terms of a synthetic cohort.
One has to imagine women living to age
45 marrying for the first time at the agespecific first-marriage rates of 1970.

I shall apply this synthetic cohort technique to elucidate the trends in nonmarriage and childlessness among white
and nonwhite women in the United States.
The results are significantly different from
the real cohort rates provided by the
census. We shall find that, among white
women, both nonmarriage and childlessness have increased rather than decreased
in recent years and that, among nonwhite

women, there has been a significant increase in nonmarriage and only a slight
decline in childlessness.

PERIOD RATES OF SPINSTERHOOD

The percentages of never-married (single) women aged 40-44 in four consecutive censuses are given in the upper half
of Table 1. As we indicated earlier, the

figures for white and nonwhite women
show somewhat opposite trends. One may
be tempted to conclude that more and
more white women have been getting married in recent years and that nonwhite
women have increasingly chosen to remain
single. But the percentages are not obtained from the age-specific first-marriage
rates of the corresponding census years.
The percentage for white women in 1970,
for example, is 5.2. This number depends
on the age-specific first-marriage rates of
the birth cohort of 1926-30, and these
rates roughly correspond to the period
1940-70. If we want to find the percentage

Spinsterhood and Childlessness

135

of single women aged 40-44 that will be
indicative of the marriage situation in
1970, we must obtain that figure on the
basis of the age-specific first-marriage
rates of 1970, as we obtain the period life
table for 1970 from the age-specific death
rates of 1970. Once we do that, the resulting figure may turn out to be quite different from 5.2, depending on the marriage
condition in 1970.

The computation of age-specific firstmarriage rates for a year~—say, 1970—
needs, in addition to single populations by
ages, the first marriage statistics by ages
of bride for 1970. Since such marriage
data for the nation as a whole are not
available for the thirty-year period under
investigation, it is not possible to construct
a so-called “marriage table” (analogous to
a “life table”) for a particular census year.
We shall estimate the first-marriage condition in a decade from a comparison of
single populations in two consecutive censuses and thereby construct the marriage
tables. We shall label them as the average
marriage tables for the three decades 194050, 1950-60, and 1960-70. Once the marriage tables have been constructed, we
shall know—for white women in 1960-70,
for example—the percentage out of a
birth cohort of a hundred women that will
remain single up to the end of the childbearing period if all of them survive
through this period, and if, as they get
older, they are subjected to the age-specific first-marriage rates of white women
in the decade 1960-70. This technique of
constructing synthetic cohort for a decade
has been used by Hajnal (1953) and
Agarwala (1962).

Table 2 gives the marriage tables for
white and nonwhite women for the decades
1940-50, 1950-60, and 1960-70. Let us
explain these tables by considering the
table for whites in 1940-50 as an example.
We ignore migration and mortality, which,

z out of a birth cohort of 1,000 women (ignoring mortality).

in the present problem, is the same as
assuming that the marital status composition remains unaffected by these two
components of population change. From
a simple law of probability, we can write:

The probability that a woman aged
x-+-10 in 1950 is single = (the probability that a woman aged x in 1940 is
single) X (the probability that a single
woman aged x in 1940 will remain single
at age x +10 in 1950). (1)

We denote the second probability on the
right side of equation (1) by 102. Expressing the probabilities in the form of
ratios (i.e., favorable cases/equally likely
cases), we can rewrite equation (1) as

10P2 = single women/total women (aged

Thus, for «= 17.5, we obtain from the
census, for women aged 25-30 in 1950,
731,190 single women out of 5,625,840
total women. For women aged 15-20 in
1940, we obtain 4,778,960 single women
out of 5,377,020 total women. Thus,

731,190/5,625,840
4,778,960/5,377,020

All the probabilities 19), can be obtained
in a similar way. We note that for x = 7.5
and 12.5, the number of single women is
equal to the number of total women in
the age group (x — 2.5, x + 2.5).

The quantity S, is defined as the number of single women at age x out of a
birth cohort of 1,000 (=S 9) women.

Obviously, both S75 and Sie.5 are equal to
1,000. For computing other S, values, we
use the formula,

Sz = S210 X 10P2—10)

© = 17.5, 22.5,..., 42.5. (3)

For example, Se7.5 is given by the product
of Siz.5 (= 833) and 10f17.5 (= 0.146),
which is 122. The last figure in the S,
column (corresponding to x = 42.5) gives
the number of women, out of a cohort of
1,000, that will remain single up to the
end of the childbearing period. This number is 35 (i.e., 3.5 per cent) for white
women in 1940-50, All such numbers (in
terms of 100) are put together in the
lower half of Table 1.

It is interesting to note that the numbers
corresponding to census years and those
corresponding to decades in Table 1 lead
to drastically different conclusions. We
now see from our decade figures that for
both white and nonwhite women there has
been a continuous increase in the number
who choose to remain unmarried throughout their childbearing period. We should
emphasize here that these are not real
numbers but hypothetical numbers calculated from the 30/2 values of a decade,
similar to the numbers 7, in a life table
that are computed from the g, values of
a year.

PERIOD RATES OF CHILDLESSNESS

Childlessness among married American
women has shown wide fluctuations in the
last few decades. The possibility of a
woman’s being childless depends to a large
extent on her age at marriage and total
exposure to married life. For women who
are widowed, divorced, or married more
than once at the time of the census, it is
difficult to estimate the total number of
years they were married. Therefore, if we
want to study the effect of age at mar
Spinsterhood and Childlessness

137

riage and total exposure to married life
on childlessness, the ideal data would be
those on children ever born cross-classified
by present age and age at marriage (or
duration of marriage) of women married
once and husband present, ie., for unbroken marriages. Fortunately, precisely
this information is available from the censuses of 1940, 1950, 1960, and 1970. It
may be mentioned here that in 1940 and
1950 duration of marriage (or age at
matriage) is given only for women married once and husband present, and this
makes it impossible to extend our analysis
to broken marriages even if we wanted to
do so. Some analysis of childlessness based
on 1960 census data has been done by
Mitra (1966), Kunz and _ Brinkerhoff
(1969), and Veevers (1971).

confronted with the problem of finding the
period percentages for a decade that are
free from the effects of women’s behaviors
with respect to age patterns of marriage
and first births prior to that decade.
Contrary to our belief, the percentages for
census years in Table 3 show significant
reductions in childlessness in recent years.
Again, we ask ourselves the question:
What percentage of married women would
remain childless up to the end of the childbearing period if all of them marry once,
survive, remain married to the end of
the childbearing period, and are subjected
to the age-specific rates of first marriage
and first-birth as shown, for example, by
the white women in the decade 1960-70?

To answer this question, we have to
first construct childlessness tables by age
at marriage, similar to the marriage tables
in Table 2. The basic data needed for
these tables are the number of childless

and total women, married once and husband present, by age and duration of
marriage. Representing ages and durations
by their midpoints (the errors due to this
assumption are expected to cancel out)
and noting that the difference between the
present age and the duration of marriage
gives the age at marriage, we construct the
childlessness tables as shown in Table 4.

Let us take for illustration the childlessness table for white women in the decade
1940-50 corresponding to age-at-marriage
15. Ignoring again the effect of migration
and mortality on the parity composition
of women, let us denote by 19P. the probability that a childless woman (married
once at age 15 and husband present) aged
x in 1940 will remain childless at age
x-+ 10 in 1950, given that her marital
status does not change during the decade.
As in equations (1) and (2), we can
express this probability as

the probability that a woman (married once at age 15

10P y=

and husband present) aged x -+- 10 in 1950 is childless

the probability that a woman (married once at age 15
and husband present) aged

x in 1940 is childless
(4)

childless women/total women [married once at age 15 and

husband present, in the age group (# -}- 7.5, x -+ 12.5) in 1950]
“~~ childless women/total women [married once at age 15 and’

husband present, in the age group (x — 2.5, x + 2.5) in 1940]

== 7.5, 12.5,..., 32.5.

 

Let us calculate this probability for x =
17.5. For white women, married once and
husband present, we have the following
data from the census: For women aged
25-30 married 10-15 years in 1950, there
are 40,380 childless women out of a total
of 663,840 women. For women aged 15-20
married 0-5 years in 1940, there are
207,560 childless women out of a total of
398,440 women. From these figures we
obtain

40,380/663,840

= 0.117.
207,560/398,440

10P 37.5 =

We define C, as the number of childless
women (married once and husband present) at age x out of a marriage cohort of
1,000 (= C,) women with age at marriage
a. For all x =a, C,z,== 1,000, and for
other x values, C, is calculated from the
equation

Cz = Cr10 X 10P 2-10;

x=at2.5,a-+ 7.5,...,42.5. (5)

For example, Cez.5 is obtained from the
product of Cyz5 (= 553) and 19Pizs
(= 0.117) as 65. Here again, the last

number, C425, is the number of women
out of a cohort of 1,000 that will remain
childless up to the end of the childbearing
period. (In a few cases, it was necessary
to replace the calculated C, value by its
preceding value to ensure nonincreasing
pattern.) For whites in 1940-50 corresponding to age-at-marriage 15, this number is 37. All such numbers by age at
Marriage are shown together in the lower
half of Table 5, and they clearly demonstrate a positive relationship between age
at marriage and childlessness (or, equivalently, an inverse relationship between
total exposure to married life and childlessness).

If we want an overall percentage of
childlessness for a decade, we need to know
the distribution of women (married once
and husband present) by age at marriage
for that particular decade. This distribution can be obtained easily from the marriage tables in Table 2. The difference
between two consecutive numbers in an
S, column in Table 2 gives the number of

Das Gupta

 

Social Biology

marriages in that particular age interval.
Representing these intervals by their midpoints (i.e., 15, 20, etc.), we can prepare
a table showing the ages at marriage of
those who marry. These cases will not add
up to 1,000 because some women will remain single throughout their childbearing
period. For white women in the decade
1940-50, for example, there are 35 such
cases of nonmarriage. Excluding these
women, we can reconstruct a frequency
distribution showing the ages at marriage
for 1,000 women who do marry. These
distributions are shown in the upper half
of Table 5.

By combining the distribution of women
by age at marriage and the per cent childless by age at marriage, both given in
Table 5, it is possible to find a single index
of childlessness for each decade. Thus, for
white women in 1940-50, we find the per
cent childless as

(173 X 3.7 4-534 X5.9-+...-- 10
x 66.9) / 1,000 = 9.0 per cent.

This percentage and other similar figures
are shown in the lower half of Table 3.

It is evident from the decade figures in
Table 3 that childlessness among white
women has increased and that among nonwhite women it has remained virtually
unchanged in the last decade, although the
census figures in the same table show a
sharp reduction in childlessness for both
categories. It may also be concluded from
the decade figures in Table 3—contrary to
the indications in the census figures in this
table that nonwhite women still have a
much higher percentage of childlessness—
that there is essentially no difference in
the extent of childlessness between white
and nonwhite women in the United States
at the present time.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

A demographic phenomenon can be
looked at from two different angles,
namely, the cohort approach and the period approach. Neither of them can claim
to be superior to or serve as a substitute
for the other. The decision to choose one
approach in preference to the other rests
entirely on the objective of the study. Ii,
for example, we are particularly interested
in the fertility behavior of women who
were born in 1930, we fix that cohort and
may want to study, as they grow up, their
age-specific fertility rates corresponding to
different points of time. On the other hand,
if we are interested in the fertility pattern
of the women in 1970, we fix the time and
may want to examine their age-specific
rates corresponding to different cohorts.
The former is obviously a cohort study,
and the latter, a period study.

The extent of singleness or childlessness
among women who have completed their
childbearing years can be read directly
from the census reports. While these data
give useful information about the mar
Spinsterhood and Childlessness

141

riage and fertility behavior of the cohorts
of women born several decades ago, they
fail to indicate the rates at which the
current women are marrying or bearing
children. Any attempt to infer the latter
from the census rates may even lead to
diametrically opposite conclusions, as we
have shown in this paper. Or, in other
words, we need to study singleness and
childlessness from the period point of
view. We have therefore provided in this
paper the period measures of these two
phenomena for the white and nonwhite
women in the United States from the census data of 1940, 1950, 1960, and 1970.
The technique of constructing a synthetic
cohort for a decade is used to find the
period rates for the three decades 1940—
50, 1950-60, and 1960~70.

The salient findings of the paper are
given in Tables 1 and 3. Table 1 presents
the census (cohort) rates and the decade
(period) rates of singleness among white
and nonwhite women aged 40-44. The
decade rates provide answers to the following type of question: If 100 women
are born together and survive to the end
of the childbearing period and if, as they
grow up, they are subjected to the agespecific first-marriage rates typical of
white women in the decade 1960-70, how
many of them are expected to remain
single (never-married) up to the end of the
childbearing period? These rates have increased over the last three decades for both
white and nonwhite women. However,
compared to white women, the nonwhite
percentages have grown at a much faster
rate between the first two decades and at
a slower rate between the last two
decades. Starting at about the same level
in 1940-50, the per cent single among nonwhite women becomes about twice that for
white women in 1960-70. It is interesting
to note that all these conclusions that we
draw from the decade rates are not at all

apparent from the census rates in the upper half of the table.

Table 3 provides the census (cohort)
percentages and the decade (period) percentages of childless women among whites
and nonwhites aged 40-44. The decade
rates deal with the following type of question: If 100 women are born together,
marry only once, survive, and remain married (husband present) to the end of the
childbearing period and if, as they grow
up, they are subjected to the distribution
by age at first marriage typical of white
women in the decade 1960-70 and to the
age-specific first-birth rates typical of
white women (married once and husband
present) in the decade 1960-70, how many
of these 100 married women are expected
to remain childless up to the end of the
childbearing period? The decade rates
show that childlessness decreased drastically between the decades 1940-50 and
1950-60 for both white and nonwhite
women. For -white women, however, it
again increased in the decade 1960-70,
while practically no changes occurred in
the nonwhite rates during that time. Although childlessness among nonwhite
women in 1940-50 is about twice that for
white women in the same decade, the rates
are about the same in the last decade
(1960-70). Again we note that, no matter
whether we compare rates by time or by
race, the census rates in the upper half of
Table 3 do not lead to our foregoing conclusions.

Much of the anomaly of differing census
and decade rates can be explained if we
take cognizance of the fact that the marriage rates and the birth rates have shown
tremendous fluctuations in the last few
decades and if we carefully study how

Social Biology

these fluctuations are expected to affect
the two kinds of rates in Table 3. It is
well documented that there was a postponement of births during the Depression
years in the thirties, followed by a postwar
baby boom that continued through the
late fifties, and then a gradual decline in
fertility up to the present time. This trend
is typified by the fertility rates (per 1,000
women aged 15-44 years) of 75.8, 113.3,
122.7, and 85.7 in the years 1936, 1947,
1957, and 1968, respectively.

Instead of discussing each percentage in
Table 3 in the light of this trend, let us
try to explain only one interesting feature
in the rates for white women: Why do the
census rates for 1950, 1960, and 1970 portray a declining trend in childlessness,
whereas the decade rates for 1950-60 and
1960-70 show an increase? To answer this
question, we note that the cohorts aged
40-44 in 1950, 1960, and 1970 passed
through their prime years of childbearing
during the thirties, forties, and fifties respectively. Since the extent of childlessness
is expected to be inversely related to the
fertility level, the declining trend in childlessness may be attributed to the rising
trend in fertility in the three decades mentioned above. On the other hand, the decade rates in childlessness for 1950-60 and
1960-70 depend on the average fertility
levels in the fifties and sixties respectively.
This again explains why there has been an
increase in childlessness between the decades 1950-60 and 1960-70.
