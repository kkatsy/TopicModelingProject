Hindu and Christian Fertility in India:
A Test of Three Hypotheses

ABSTRACT: Three hypotheses interpret differences in human fertility among religious groups.
“The Particularistic Theology Hypothesis stresses the pronatalist influence of doctrines forbidding
artificial contraception and emphasizing the importance of sons, while the Characteristics
‘Hypothesis focuses on the antinatalist effect of urban residence, higher education, and late age

t marriage. But the Minority Status Hypothesis argues that such antinatalist effects may be
stronger for a minority than a majority, since better-educated, late-marrying urbanites have
eater chances for upward mobility. Minority groups with these advantages may have much
Sower fertility than similar people in the majority group if antinatalism is seen as a way to counter
prelu and move up. I tested these three hypotheses with data from the 1981 Census of India,
rom which I calculated mean numbers of children ever born per wife aged 35-44. I standardized
“the mean for differences between Hindu and Christian women by urban residence, education,
sage, and length of marriage. The standardized fertility rates of Hindus and Christians were
imilar in 25 states/union territories. Only in Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland did the Hindu
Sfeligious minority have a lower standardized birth rate than the Christian majority; but the
‘Muslim minority had one like the Christians’. This pattern was most consistent with the
SPharacteristics Hypothesis.

factors play in creating reproductive
differences among social groups. For
example, in comparison to the Hindus,
the Christian population of India is
composed of larger proportions of people who are urban, highly educated,
and first married at ages over 20 (Roy,
1989; Schermerhorn, 1978). As such, if
Christians do have a lower rate of fertility than Hindus, the Characteristics
Hypothesis would assign its cause only
to these differences in population composition. This explanation implies that
Christian and Hindu women with the
same residence, education, and age at
marriage should have the same rate
of fertility and denies that religious
theology or membership in a socially
salient minority group could exert a
separate influence on reproductive behavior.

The “Minority Status Hypothesis”
does not deny the importance of religious doctrines or social and demographic factors in producing racial and
religious differences in fertility; but it
departs from the other two hypotheses
in attributing a causal role to the discrimination experienced by members
of a minority group. For example,
Goldscheider noted that Jewish fertility has been markedly below that of
Protestants and Catholics in the United
States since the 1880’s. This Jewish antinatalism can be explained neither by
the Particularistic Theology Hypothesis nor by the Characteristics Hypothesis, since Jews have no religious ideology prescribing fewer children and
since they maintain persistently lower
fertility when compared to Protestants
and Catholics of similar metropolitan
status and social class. Likewise, he
found that U.S. black women with at

Social Biology

least a high-school diploma and in the
later ages of childbearing had lower
cumulative fertility than did white
women of identical education and age.
Goldscheider concluded that Jews and
better-educated blacks had lower fertility partly to make up for religious
and racial prejudice that hampered
their pursuit of upward socioeconomic
mobility.

From these North American examples, Goldscheider generalized that
when privileged members of a powerful religious or racial majority group
impose social segregation even on
those members of a minority group
who have become economically similar
to them through upward mobility, then
the latter may suffer greater economic
insecurities. This formulation implicitly assumes that economic insecurities
lower the minority’s perceived benefits
of children. Indeed, in institutional
contexts where elite members of the
majority group control access to coveted material resources, then having
many children may confer few advantages to minority parents in acquiring
wealth. Once minority couples have
scaled discriminatory barriers and
reached a desired level of socioeconomic status, then moderate or high
fertility should appear still more expensive to them, if they are to establish
all their children on a level no worse
than their own. In other words, the
cost-benefit assessment of the value of
children is likely to define them as a
greater deterrence against upward social mobility or retention of high social
Status by minority than majority subpopulations and, as a result, should
motivate successful minorities to have
fewer children than their majority

peers (Goldscheider, 1971; Goldschetder and Uhlenberg, 1969). The implication is that despite secularization or
mobility into the upper class, the religious or racial minority will remain reproductively distinctive if the majority
group can still threaten its access to
coveted material resources. This threat
would be signalled by a sustained social
segregation imposed by elite members
“Sof a religious or racial majority group
&upon elite members of a minority
sroup.
& The three hypotheses have been
étested with data on religious and racial
inorities in Canada, the United
~States, Europe, Australia, and New
~ Zealand. Canadian examples are Halli
(1987) and Trovato (1987). U.S. exam=ples include Bean and Swicegood
s(1985), Cooney et al. (1981), Jiobu
‘and Marshall (1977), Johnson (1979),
SJohnson and Lean (1985), Johnson and
‘Nishida (1980), Ritchey (1975), and
2Roberts and Lee (1974). For European
‘illustrations, consult Coward (1980)
‘cand Kennedy (1973). Cases from Australia and New Zealand can be found in
2Day (1968). Day held that religious differences in fertility were unlikely to be
‘glarge or substantively important in so<cieties lacking a high degree of contraSceptive prevalence. Perhaps for this
Creason, few tests of the three hypotheses have been conducted with data on
minorities in Lesser Developed Countries (LDC’s).

An exception is a study of Filipino
college and university students which
found that Protestants, in contrast
to Catholics, wanted fewer children,
more often said that marital contraception should start before the first birth,
and less often opposed artificial contra

ception as controverting divine will
(Johnson and Burton, 1987). These relationships are congruent with the Particularistic Theology Hypothesis.

A second exception is a study of five
ethnic minority groups in Liberia,
whose fertility was found not to differ
much from that of the ethnic majority
group (Americo-Liberians) after such
characteristics as women’s work status,
education, rural-urban residence, and
marital status had been statistically
controlled (Kollehlon, 1989). The results for Liberia are consistent with the
Characteristics Hypothesis.

Thirdly, when a multiple regression
had statistically controlled such characteristics as wife’s age at marriage, duration of marriage, rural-urban residence, education, and work status,
there was a significantly smaller net
number of children ever born per wife
among the Christian, Hindu, and Muslim minorities than to the Buddhist
majority in Sri Lanka and to the
Indian-Hindu and Chinese-Buddhist
minorities in Malaysia than to the
Malay Muslim majority (Little and
Perera, 1981; Noor Laily et al., 1985).
Consequently, the findings for Sri
Lanka and Malaysia are compatible
with the Minority Status Hypothesis.
In sum, there is evidence favoring all
three hypotheses associating religion
with human fertility in LDC’s.

India’s population, the second largest in the world, is composed of so
many ethnic and religious groupings as
to be almost unrivalled in diversity.
The caste system assigns occupational
niches and thereby creates barriers to
the acquisition of wealth by lowercaste Hindus. However, upward mobility would seem to be at least as

difficult for religious minorities, since
segregation of religious communities
is integral to the national make-up.
While not manifest in the existence of
separate political parties, this segregation can be seen in separate legal systems (e.g., Hindu law vs. Muslim law).
As such, even nominal Christians or
Muslims of Indian origin who have
achieved wealth and upward mobility
do not mix readily with their Hindu
peers and face the economic liabilities
of this separation (discussed more fully
below). For these reasons, India provides a natural laboratory for testing
the three hypotheses relating religion
to fertility.

SociAL MEANING OF MINORITY STATUS
FOR INDIAN CHRISTIANS

Indian Christians are certainly a statistical minority, as they were only 2.43
per cent of the national population
counted in the 1981 census. But a statistical minority group does not face
discrimination automatically. Thus,
Goldscheider’s initial works required
further specification of the structural
contexts wherein manifest or subtle
prejudice develops against a numerically small group.

To this end, Schermerhorn (1978,
pp. 15-16) wrote that a proportionally
small religious group cannot be a “‘minority group” in the sociological sense
unless its members are also disadvantaged politically and economically by
their membership. But Indian Christians do not suffer political disadvantage by virtue of their religious orientation. A divisive and destructive force
in the national political life of India
prior to Independence in 1947 was
“confessional politics’’—politics used
to promote the manifest interests of

Social Biology

particular religious groups. Therefore,
the Indian state was founded on the
principles of secularism, pluralism,
and centrism. After Independence, the
Congress Party of Nehru and Gandhi
did not become the confessional party
of the Hindu religious majority partly
because of the challenge that such an
identity would have posed to maintaining a broad national following. In
addition, the Hindus are subdivided
along the lines of class, caste, subcaste,
rural/urban residence, region, and language; and such lines of cleavage have
thwarted their coalescence around
common political issues seen as salient
to Hinduism (Rudolph and Rudolph,
1987; Schermerhorn, 1978). Only in
Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, and
Kerala are there political parties with
specific religious identities. Therefore,
in most states and union territories of
India since Independence, religiousgroup membership has been incidental
to the exercise of political power.
Disadvantage in economic, rather
than political, power determines the
minority status of Christians in India.
In general, Christianity has appealed
most broadly to the poorest Indians,
i.e., members of scheduled castes and
scheduled tribes. Converts formed endogamous enclaves that used churchsupported educational systems as
ladders to higher occupational status
(Mandelbaum, 1970). Through training in church-related schools, colleges,
and universities, Christians achieved
higher rates of literacy in English than
did Hindus and thereby netted a disproportionate share of jobs in the civil
service, railway, and army, as well as
in communications media, school systems, and white collar occupations
(Schermerhorn, 1978, p. 190). The
Vol. 40, No. 1-2

Christian church’s emphasis on education for women (an innovation for India) was at first resisted by Indian
Christians but later accepted as a form
of dowry for attracting a higher-class
son-in-law. Yet despite these economic
incentives to conversion, Christians
typically work under Hindus in the formal urban economy and seldom become entrepreneurs or arrivals in the
‘2 uppermost socioeconomic classes withSiout Hindu sponsorship (Schermer® horn, 1978, pp. 199-203). The handi

S _ Christians compete against other re+= ligious groups for resources in a variety
p> of physical, social, and economic envig ronments across India, and these set= tings also serve to differentiate Christians from each other within the
>subcontinent. For instance, the schedy uled tribes in Northeastern India (most
3 of whom are Christians) are distin< guishable from other Christians and
= from caste Hindus by race, language,
A occupation, and geography. The racial
features of these tribes are Mongolian,
and their linguistic dialects are TibetoBurmese. Unlike other Christians or
caste Hindus, the scheduled tribes in
Northeastern India largely practice
slash-and-burn cultivation of rice with
hoes, knives, and sickles and supplement the rice crop with foods from
hunting and gathering. Communal
ownership has hampered agricultural
development, since land cannot be of

fered by individual farmers as collateral for loans. In addition, most of the
tribal peoples in Northeastern India
live in the forested hills, where the terrain has made the irrigation of rice paddies difficult and has physically isolated
the inhabitants from the nontribal peoples in the plains. The resultant lack
of transportation and communication
linkages with outside markets has further limited the economic development of the Northeastern states and
territories. The economically disadvantaged status of the scheduled tribes
was formally recognized by the Indian
Constitution of 1950, which reserved
seats for tribal peoples in secondary
and tertiary educational institutions
and in legislatures. It is apparent that
the occupational advantages of educated Christians over the Hindu masses
within the more developed regions of
India do not characterize most Christians (who are primarily tribal peoples)
in Northeastern India.

It was argued above that if differences in Hindu and Christian fertility
arise solely from specific doctrines forbidding efficient contraception or placing a premium on sons, then Hindu fertility should exceed that of Christians
in all ecological zones of India. On the
other hand, the Characteristics Hypothesis would propose similar fertility
between Hindus and Christians in all
subnational contexts after such distinguishing factors as urban residence, education, and age at marriage had been
held constant. Yet if a small size adversely affects a religious group’s social
and economic power in India, then the
social and economic disadvantages
should be greatest for Christians in the
states/union territories where Christians are a minority and least for them

in the states/union territories where
they are the numerical majority. Also,
these disadvantages should weigh
more similarly on Christians and Hindus in the states/union territories
where both are numerical minorities.
Therefore, the Minority Status Hypothesis would predict lower Christian
than Hindu fertility in the first group of
states/territories, lower Hindu than
Christian fertility in the second group
of states/territories, and similar Christian and Hindu fertility in the third
group of states/territories (Figure 1).
As such, aggregating states/union territories in this way and comparing religious differences in fertility across
these aggregates permits a simultaneous test of the three hypotheses associating religion with human fertility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The 1981 census was the first in India to ask currently married women for
the number of children ever born alive
to them. Furthermore, the census
asked the wives’ religious preferences,
their ages (in completed years), and
durations of marriage. Thus, for a

given state or union territory, I computed the mean numbers of children
ever born to currently married Hindu
and Christian women aged 35~44 by
five-year duration-of-marriage groupings. I multiplied these means by the
“standard population”—the number
of all wives aged 35-44 in the nation
arrayed by rural-urban residence, education, age (within the 35-44 year
grouping), and duration of marriage.
Summing these products yielded the
total number of children expected ever
to be born; and dividing this sum by the
size of the standard population yielded
the standardized cumulative fertility
rate. This “direct method” of standardization removed any differences in
the mean number of children ever born
per Hindu and Christian wife in a given
state/territory that were attributable
to compositional differences between
them in rurality, education, age, or
length of marriage (see Table 1 for an
illustration and Shryock and Siegel,
1976, pp. 241-43, for further discussion).

It is important to consider how differences between Hindus and Christians in net errors of census coverage

might bias the contrasts in their standardized rates of fertility. One way to
judge the accuracy of a census count is
to examine the sex ratio (the number of
males per 100 females) of the enumerated population. In the absence of
heavy population losses due to wars or
emigrations or heavy gains from immigrations, national sex ratios below 90
suggest a severe undercount of males
‘relative to females; and sex ratios
above 105 imply a severe undercount
of females relative to males (Shryock
Fand Siegel, 1976, p. 107). The 1981
oCensus of India yielded a national sex
Cratio of 100.77 for Christians and
107.16 for Hindus (Office of the Regsistrar General, 1984). The distorted
Sex ratio for Hindus was at least partly

unissed by censuses in South Asia are
‘those with little or no education, who

Awhose low gender status makes them
easier to overlook when a male household informant is reporting to the census enumerator. But such women typically have much higher fertility. The
results of the relatively greater net

should be to bias downward the standardized fertility rates of Hindus, to
minimize the degree to which these
rates appear to exceed those for Christians, and to weaken the apparent in

would operate against support for the

limited the effects of these biases not
only by testing whether Hindus and
Christians had significantly different
standardized fertility rates, but also by
examining how these differences were
patterned among the best-educated urban women.!

The 1981 census showed that the
three largest religious groups in India
(Hindus, 82.64 per cent of the national
population; Muslims, 11.35 per cent;
and Christians, 2.43 percent) had different subnational clusterings (Table
2). Hindus lacked a numerical majority
in seven of the thirty states for which
data on religious composition were obtained by the census.? Owing to strong
missionary activity in the Northeast
during the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries, Christians comprised a large
numerical majority in Mizoram (83.81
per cent) and Nagaland (80.21 per
cent), and a narrow majority in Meghalaya (52.62 per cent) (see Table 2
and Figure 2). The indigenous religion
in the Northeast prior to the advent of
Western Christian missionaries was an
animism mixed with strong elements of

1fn an analysis of variance, this was represented
by a three-way interaction term associating religion,
education, and urban residence with the standardized fertility rates.

It was impossible to complete the 1981 census in
the State of Assam because of civil unrest among
religious groups. Therefore, Assam does not appear
in this analysis.

enumerations, differences in the rates
did not arise from sampling errors.
Thus, while tests of statistical significance were not strictly applicable, F
statistics from an analysis of variance
(ANOVA) in fertility rates were used
to condense the information contained
in the 560 rates and to judge the relative importance of urban-rural residence, education and religion of the
wife, and religious composition of the
state/union territory.

The ANOVA in Table 3 showed
that the standardized number of children ever born per wife aged 35-44
was significantly lower for urban
women (F = 119.429, p < 0.001) and
for women with higher levels of education (F = 57.013, p < 0.001). However, the combination of urban residence with higher education was not
associated with much lower fertility for
Christians than Hindus (F = 0.021 for
the residence X education xX religion
interaction term).4 For both religious
groups, the level of the standardized
fertility rates depended on whether the
religious majority of the state/territory
was Hindu, Christian, or other
(F = 15.064, p < 0.001, for the religion X majority group interaction
term). The latter relationship is disaggregated by the ANOVA in Table 4.

Table 4 shows that the standardized
fertility rates of all religious subgroups
were much lower in the 22 states/union
territories where Hindus were the religious majority than in the three
states/union territories where Christians were the religious majority
(F = 70.96, beta = —1.36, p < 0.01)

unchanged.

or in the three states/union territories
where neither Hindus nor Christians
held the majority (F = 18.80, beta
= —0.66, p < 0.01). The higher rates
of cumulative fertility in the latter six
states/union territories (Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Punjab)
likely resulted from the high concentration of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. It is noteworthy that the
State of Punjab had the largest concentration of peoples in the scheduled
castes (27 per cent of the state popu-.
lation) of all the states and union territories included in the 1981 census
(Directorate of Census Operations in
Nagaland, 1988, p. 99). Furthermore,
the populations in the other five states/
territories had high concentrations of
scheduled tribes. In fact, scheduled
tribes made up the majority of the population in the three states/union territories where Christians constituted
more than half the population (the percentages of scheduled tribes to total
populations were 80.58 per cent in Meghalaya, 93.55 per cent in Mizoram,
and 83.99 per cent in Nagaland) (Directorate of Census Operations in Nagaland, 1988, pp. 100-103).

Table 4 shows very similar Hindu
and Christian fertility in states and territories where Hindus were the religious majority (beta=0.08, p <
0.14) and where both shared the status
of a religious minority (beta = —0.15,
p < 0.31). These two findings were
consistent with the Characteristics Hypothesis (Figure 1, Row 2, Cols. 1 and
3). However, Hindu fertility was much
lower than Christian fertility (beta
= —0.75, p < 0.01) in the states and

pThis latter relationship appeared to
contradict the Characteristics Hypoth‘sesis in favor of the Minority Status Hypothesis (Figure 1, Col. 2).
= It is unlikely that religious doctrine
denouncing efficient contraception led
to higher Christian than Hindu fertility
in Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland. Catholics were not disproportionately represented in these areas,
which were the focus of intense Protestant missionary activity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (Hollister, 1956; Webster, 1976). However, if
the status of being a religious minority
depressed Hindu fertility rates below
Christian levels in Meghalaya, Mizo

ram, and Nagaland, then the same
phenomenon should be observed for
the Muslim minority group in these
areas.

To examine this possibility, data
from these two states and one union
territory were pooled, and the variance
in the standardized cumulative fertility
rates between Christians and Muslims
was estimated with an ANOVA (Table
5). The variance did not differ significantly between the majority Christians
and the minority Muslims (F = 1.635),
a result at odds with the Minority
Status Hypothesis. A plausible interpretation, congruent with the Characteristics Hypothesis, is that the great

at least half the population.

Muslims in Meghalaya, Mizoram, and
Nagaland rendered their fertility rates
similar to each other and boosted these
rates above Hindu levels.

In contrast to most Hindus within
their own state/territory or Christians
in other regions, almost all Christians
in Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland
belong to scheduled tribes, practice
swidden agriculture, cannot produce
a marketable surplus, live outside a
monetized economy, and exist in poverty. Because subsistence farmers do
not usually experience large numbers
of children as an unbearable burden
and perhaps even view them as a cheap
and valuable source of labor for the
labor-intensive tasks of slash-and-burn
agriculture, their fertility rates are
higher than for persons with other livelihoods. The 1981 census data did not

permit me to control the effects of
wives’ and husbands’ occupations on
rates of cumulative fertility. Yet the
characteristics of Christians in Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland as impoverished farmers or the offspring of
impoverished farmers can likely interpret not only the higher fertility rates
of Christians than Hindus there but
also the much higher fertility rates of
those states/territories.

Likewise, severe poverty characterizes most Muslims in Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Mizoram. Muslims were
only 1.52 per cent of the Nagalander
population in 1981, but their numbers
had tripled during the 1971-81 decade
(Directorate of Census Operations in
Nagaland, 1988). Much of this increase
was due to inmigration from the State
of Assam, which borders Nagaland and

decade in the state (Directorate of
Census Operations in Meghalaya,

the Muslim population in Mizoram in
the 1971-81 decade was more modest
than that in Nagaland and Meghalaya,

zoram, 1988, p. 92). Consequently, the
deep impoverishment of Muslims relative to Hindus in Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Mizoram has roots in the civil
unrest of Assam and the even poorer
economy of Bangladesh.

DISCUSSION

Three distinct approaches have
interpreted religious differences in human fertility. The Particularistic Theology Hypothesis stresses the pronatalist influence of special theological
doctrines forbidding usage of efficient
contraception or emphasizing the importance of sons. The Characteristics
Hypothesis argues that the antinatalist
effects of such characteristics as urban
residence, higher education, or late
age at marriage ought to operate similarly for all religious groups such that
differences in group composition on
these variables should account completely for differences in their fertility.
However, the Minority Status Hypothesis contends that the antinatalist
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

102

effects of urban residence or higher education might be stronger for a minority than a majority, since better educated urbanites have greater prospects
for upward mobility but since minorities with such characteristics may face
prejudice or other impediments that
hamper their pursuit of it. In such a
context, the members of a religious minority group are thought to compensate with lower fertility than the majority group, if antinatalism is seen as a
way to move up. Until now, almost all
tests of these hypotheses have used
data from countries in North America,
Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
Departing from that tradition, this
study used data from the 1981 census of
India to calculate mean numbers of
children ever born per Hindu and
Christian wife aged 35-44 years. The
cumulative fertility rates were standardized by the “direct method” so as
to remove any differences in fertility
between Hindu and Christian wives
attributable to differences in their composition by urban residence, education, age (within the 35-44 year grouping), or length of marriage. The
standardized fertility rates were compared for Hindus and Christians in 28
states/union territories aggregated into
three groups: 22 with a Hindu majority
group; 3 (Meghalaya, Mizoram, and
Nagaland) with a Christian majority
group; and 3 (Arunachal Pradesh,
Jammu and Kashmir, and Punjab) with
neither as the majority group.
Contrary to the Particularistic Theology Hypothesis but consistent with
the Characteristics Hypothesis, the
standardized fertility rates of Hindus
and Christians were highly similar in 25
of the states/union territories. It was
only in Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Na
Johnson

. Social Biology

galand where the Hindu religious minority group had consistently lower
standardized fertility rates than the
Christian majority group. While this
result appeared to support the Minority Status Hypothesis, further analysis
showed that the Muslim minority
group in Meghalaya, Mizoram, and
Nagaland had standardized fertility
rates comparable to those of the Christian majority, a relationship contradictory to the Minority Status Hypothesis.
It was argued above that Christians
and Muslims in these three states/territories were more likely than Hindus
there or their coreligionists elsewhere
in India to have economic characteristics that placed them below the poverty
line. Thus, the fertility patterns described in the tables above are the most
consistent with the Characteristics Hypothesis.

The findings of this study have implications for the national family planning program. For example, even after
currently married women’s present
ages and durations of marriage had
been statistically controlled, Christians
had lower cumulative fertility in states/
union territories where Hindus predominate numerically as compared to
Christians in areas lacking a Hindu majority. This result may have reflected a
greater prevalence of contraception
among Christians in areas where Hindus predominate than among Christians elsewhere in India, since the
Statistical controls addressed the biological effects of aging and nuptiality
on the exposure to the risk of childbirth. This prevalence probably did not
represent antinatalist pressures unique
to religious minorities seeking upward
socioeconomic mobility. Rather, it
most likely reflected the higher levels
 

Vol. 40, No. 1-2

of educational attainment and urbanization for Christians outside the six
States/territories lacking a Hindu majority. Indeed, women with higher education or urban residences had lower
cumulative fertility, regardless of their
State/territory or religion.

The results of this study pose several
questions for further investigation.
From these 1981 census data, it was im
= possible to compute separate fertility
“rates for Christians of mixed, IndianEuropean ancestry. The largest subF group of these are the descendants of
® British fathers employed in the military
oor the colonial administration and Indian mothers of the lower castes. Be=-cause the Anglo-Indian children of
"~ these mixed couples were rejected by
both groups, Anglo-Indians came to
Smarry endogamously, to establish separate school systems using English as
‘the medium of instruction, and to fre‘Squent segregated social clubs. Anglo2 Indians favor European dress and di“etary customs. They are commonly
‘Zemployed in government jobs associated with transportation and commu@nication, but social ostracism usually
¥ prevents their reaching the highest levels of authority (Kluck, 1985). Since
gtheir racial distinctiveness, language,
gclothing, and diet visibly set them apart
Afrom other Christians, the AngloIndian Christians may be the subgroup
within the Christian community most
likely to experience the economic disadvantages that social and cultural separation from the larger Christian and
Hindu communities creates. Future research should explore whether AngloIndian Christians have lower fertility
and higher contraceptive prevalence
than do other Christians or Hindus and
whether they report such antinatalism

as a conscious strategy to counter prejudice against them which hinders their
upward mobility.

Macro-level studies based on census
data for states, territories, or nations
can show aggregate patterns of fertility
which may or may not be consistent
with one of the three hypotheses tested
here. Such studies are of interest because research about the unique effects
of religious group membership and minority status on fertility in LDC’s is
sparse and because census data provide
convenient documentary evidence for
conducting such research. However,
the Particularistic Theology Hypothesis is grounded in the assumption that
couples know about a particular pronatalist religious doctrine, believe in it,
and consciously seek to uphold it. Similarly, the Minority Status Hypothesis
is predicated on the assumption that
couples perceive bias against them because of their membership in a numerically small group and deliberately use
low fertility as strategy to overcome
the limits this discrimination places on
their chances for upward mobility. In
short, tests of these hypotheses with
census data from LDC’s should be
supplemented by micro-level analyses
suited to explore the social-psychological linkages assumed to connect religion, minority status, and reproductive behavior.

Finally, future work should use
more recent data to seek whether an
antinatalist minority-status effect has
emerged for Christians and other religious minorities in India, as it may
have for several religious minority
groups in Sri Lanka and Malaysia (Little and Perera, 1981; Noor Laily et al.,
1985). When the 1981 census of India
was conducted, about 23 per cent of

married couples of childbearing age
were practicing contraception (Visaria
and Visaria, 1981). The surgical methods were most prevalent, especially
among the 35-44 year age group of
women who were the focus of the
present investigation. By 1984, the
contraceptive prevalence rate had
grown to 32 per cent, and to a large
extent this growth reflected the increasing popularity of nonsurgical
methods. Because social, economic,
and environmental contexts determine
the outlays for and the payoffs of children to parents, these settings must
have been changing in India during
the 1980’s so as to motivate the rise in
contraceptive prevalence. Perhaps the
differences in reproductive behavior
among religious groups and between
minority and majority groups do not
exist at all stages of social and economic history but emerge with a transition to a monetized economy requiring an educated labor force. The
earlier advent of these economic and
educational institutions to Sri Lanka
and Malaysia than to Liberia or India

may tell why religio-ethnic communities in the former two countries were
quicker to develop distinctive reproductive patterns.
