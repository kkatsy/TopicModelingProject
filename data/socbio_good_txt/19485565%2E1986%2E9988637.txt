Quality of 1980 Census Data for American Indians

 

Jeffrey S. Passel and Patricia A. Berman

Bureau of the Census
Washington, D.C.

ABSTRACT: The count of American Indians in the 1980 census was over 70 per cent larger than
the 1970 census count. An assessment of the demographic basis for this change shows that the
cohorts from ages 10 to 74 in 1980 increased by substantial amounts, reaching 35 per cent for
many ages. Increases of this nature in the absence of immigration are demographically
impossible—an indication that the changes in response patterns identified by Passel (1976) between the 1970 and 1960 censuses persisted in 1980, possibly at even greater levels.

In addition to presenting demographic analyses of the American Indian data at the national
level, this paper includes an analysis of geographic variation of implied birth, death, and migration rates at the state level. States which historically have had large American Indian populations in general had high birth and death rates with reasonable migration rates. Many other
states, however, had anomalously low birth and death rates with extraordinarily high implied
migration rates. This pattern suggests that the changes in response may have occurred primarily in the latter areas.

Several other anomalies in the American Indian data are reported here. The sample figure
for American Indians from the 1980 census exceeds the complete count by more than 8 per cent
at the national level. Increases occurred in most states, but the amount of increase varied substantially. Also, the increases tend to occur outside American Indian areas (reservations, tribal
trust lands, etc.). Such differences are, for the most part, outside of expected sample variability.
Furthermore, differences in the number of persons reporting American Indian race and American Indian ancestry were substantial. Some of the causes of these differences are investigated
here. The paper concludes with an overall assessment of the quality and utility of these census
data for various types of analysis.

The count of American Indians, Eskimos, Aleuts! in the 1980 census was
1,420,400. This figure represents an increase more than 70 per cent over the
corresponding 1970 census count of
827,268. Since there is almost no immigration of American Indians into the

'Most of the data in this paper are for the combination of American Indians, Eskimos, and
Aleuts. We will use the terms ‘“‘American Indian”
and “Indian” to refer to this combined group.
When data are for American Indians only and do
not include Eskimos and Aleuts, the fact will be
noted in the text and the term used to refer to the
group will be marked by an asterisk, i.e., American Indian*.

United States, the increase could only
come from natural increase (the excess
of births over deaths) if the sole source
of the increase were demographic.
However, since increases of this magnitude are demographically impossible
over a sustained period, there must be a
nondemographic explanation for the almost 7 per cent average annual growth
of the American Indian population during the 1970's.

Further confirmation of the unusual
nature of the change in the numbers of
American Indians is found in the patterns of cohort change over 1970-80.

Cohorts of both sexes from ages 10 to 74
in 1980 increased by substantial
amounts, sometimes exceeding 35 per
cent, between the 1970 census and the
1980 census. These patterns indicate
that the American Indian population as
measured in the decennial censuses is
growing by “recruitment,” i.e., changes
in self-identification. The changes in response patterns identified by Passel
(1976) between the 1960 and 1970 censuses appear to have persisted in 1980,
at even greater levels.

This paper first describes the demographic dimensions of anomalies in
American Indian data from the 1980
census at the national level. The error of
closure for 1970-80 is compared to that
calculated for 1960-70 by Passel (1976).
Further examination of errors of closure
for age-sex groups focuses attention on
the demographic sources of the apparent reporting problems. Finally, the first
section of the paper presents estimated
“undercount” rates for the American
Indian population under 30 years of
age—an extension of those developed
by Passel in his earlier study.

The next section of the paper examines the geographic dimensions of the
demographic inconsistencies. Birth and
death rates and implied rates of internal
migration are presented for the American Indian population of regions, divisions, and states. The data show consistent differences over time between states
which historically have had large American Indian populations and those which
have not.

Several other anomalies in the American Indian data are also reported. Differences between the 1980 census sample data and the complete count are
investigated. This final section also has a
discussion of the differences between
the reporting of American Indian race

Social Biology

and American Indian ancestry in the
1980 census. Some of the causes and implications of these differences are investigated. The paper concludes with an
overall assessment of the quality and
utility of 1980 census data on American
Indians for various types of analysis.

DEMOGRAPHIC DIMENSIONS OF
1980 CENSUS DATA FOR
AMERICAN INDIANS

ERROR OF CLOSURE

Natural increase for the American
Indian population during the 1970-80
intercensal period was 235,476 or 28.5
per cent of the 1970 census count (see
Table 1). The natural increase is the
result of 298,546 births (corrected for
underregistration), less 63,077 deaths.
One method of estimating the American Indian population for 1980 is to add
the intercensal natural increase to the
1970 census count. This estimate for
1980 is 1,062,745—a figure which is
357,655 or an astounding 25.2 per cent
below the actual 1980 census figure. This
difference is referred to as the “error of
closure.”

For the 1960-70 decade, the error of
closure amounted to 67,006 or 9.2 per
cent of the estimated 1970 population.
Passel (1976) was unable to explain an
error this large on the basis of demographic components of change. The
only plausible explanation was an increase in the tendency for persons to
identify themselves as American Indian
in the 1970 census over the 1960 census.
The 1970-80 error of closure is over five
times as great as the 1960-70 error.

Conventional demographic explanations for the extremely large 1970-80 error of closure are also implausible and
unappealing. Understatement of births

can explain only a very small portion of
the error of closure. The births have
been corrected already by 2.6 per cent
or about 8,000 births.2 Very much
higher underregistration of American
Indian births in the 1970’s is extremely
unlikely. Overregistration of deaths is
almost never a likely explanation. In any

Estimates of completeness of birth registration for American Indians for 1950-70 are from
Passel (1976), For 1970~80, estimates are derived
by assuming that the rate of improvement in registration completeness for 1970-80 was the same as
for 1960-70. The per cent of American Indian
births registered for 1970 is estimated as 96.2 per
cent; for 1980, the estimate is 98.5 per cent. For the
1970-80 decade, the estimated completeness of
registration is 97.4 per cent. All of these figures are
consistent with the correction factors used for the
other races, population in national estimates of
census undercount (Passel and Robinson, 1984).

case, the deaths amount to only 63,000
and the error of closure is almost
358,000. The remaining demographic
component, international immigration
of American Indians, accounts for only
a few people; there were 38,190 foreignborn American Indians in the 1980 census. Thus, immigration could not possibly make up the difference between the
estimate and the census figure.

One other possibility is that the 1970
census figure was grossly understated.
Two major factors argue against this explanation. First, the amount of understatement in 1970 required to explain
the error of closure would imply an undercount of almost 30 per cent. This
level of undercount for an entire population group has never been encountered
in any recent U.S. census (Passel and

166

Robinson, 1984). Second, the study by
Passel (1976) shows that many age
groups and, indeed, possibly the entire
American Indian population were
greatly overstated in the 1970 census.
The one remaining explanation for
the large error of closure is the same as
that offered by Passel for the 1960-70 error of closure—inconsistency in the
identification of individuals as American Indians between the latter census
(1980), on the one hand, and vital statistics and the earlier census (1970), on the
other hand. Individuals must be identifying themselves as American Indian in
the 1980 census who were not identified
as American Indian in the 1970 census
or in the vital statistics system. The
changing self-identification which occurred in the 1960’s has apparently continued (and increased) in the 1970s.°

INTERCENSAL COHORT CHANGES

The error of closure identified in the
preceding section can be further broken
down to age and sex groups. The calculation shown in Table 2 starts from the
1970 census count of American Indians
by age‘ and births during the intercensal
period, corrected for underregistration.
Immigration from abroad and emigra
3One other possibility for the excess in the
American Indian population is that persons from
India may have misread or misunderstood the race
question and responded erroneously as ‘‘American Indian” rather than ‘Asian Indian.” We have
found no evidence to suggest that such misreporting was a significant factor contributing to the large
American Indian count. Specifically, the counts
for Asian Indians correspond very well to data on
immigration from India.

‘Detailed age-sex data for the American Indian population in 1970 were derived by adjusting
single year of age figures from the sample data to
complete count figures for 5-year age groups by
sex. Data by age and sex corresponding to Tables 2
and 3 are available on request from the senior author.

tion are both assumed to be negligible
for all ages in this calculation. Then,
deaths by cohort? are subtracted from
the initial populations to yield an estimated population for 1980 by age.

Differences between the age-specific
estimates for 1980 and the census figures
for American Indians represent errors
of closure. Positive errors of closure in
Table 2 indicate that the census exceeds
the estimate; negative errors, that the
census falls short of the estimate. The
error Of closure for a cohort represents
the sum of several components—errors
in the estimated components of change
and differences in coverage between the
censuses. A full understanding of the
overall error of closure for the American Indian population requires an assessment of these individual components.

The most striking feature of Table 2 is
that all of the cohorts between ages 10
and 74 in 1980 increased in size between
the 1970 census and the 1980 census. Errors of closure for these cohorts are all
large and generally exceed 30 per cent.
The only plausible explanation for this
pattern is, again, that persons are being
recruited to the American Indian population by changing their selfidentification over time.

At ages 75 and over, the errors of closure are smaller and even slightly negative. The amount of shifting selfidentification into the American Indian
category thus appears to be considerably less at older ages. In fact, for the total of all ages over 70, the error of closure is very nearly zero. This pattern

tabulated from public use tapes from the National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) for 1970-76.
Totals for other years were distributed by age using the distribution from 1974-76.

may be the result of slight misallocation
of deaths to the different cohorts at the
older ages since the errors of closure
vary considerably by age.

The errors of closure at the very
youngest ages suggest that the changing
self-identification of American Indians
is beginning to be reflected in the vital
statistics. The errors of closure under
age 10 are developed from birth statistics, not from the previous census. The
negative errors of closure for the cohort
under 5 years of age in 1980 indicate
some undercount in the 1980 census at
these ages. Thus, relative to births over
1975-80, the 1980 census is understated
and not overstated, as it is for other cohorts. For ages 5-9 in 1980, the 8 per
cent error of closure is not nearly as
large as at higher ages. For this cohort
the shifting self-identification appears to
be at an intermediate level, perhaps because the individuals counted in the census did not fill out the census form themselves.

EstTIMATED CENSUs “SUNDERCOUNT”’
(Aces UNDER 30)

Passel (1976) constructed independent demographic estimates of the
American Indian population under age
20 in 1970 from corrected births for
1950-70 and registered deaths for the
same period. He found very large
undercounts for American Indians under age 10 in the 1960 census and under
age 5 in the 1970 census. The undercounts for ages 5-14 in 1970 were moderate, but for ages 15-19 small overcounts appeared to be the beginning of
age-specific shifts in self-identification to
American Indian.

The 1970 estimates of the American
Indian population under age 20 provide
the starting point for estimates of the
same population under age 30 in 1980

Passel and Berman

Social Biology

presented here. The estimates shown in
Table 3 are based on corrected American Indian births for 1970-80 and Passel’s (1976) estimates for 1970. Registered deaths by age are subtracted from
the initial 1970 estimates to yield the estimates for 1980. The difference between the estimated American Indian
population for 1980 and the census
count provides an estimate of the “‘undercount” in the 1980 census.

At the youngest ages, under 3 years,
identification of individuals as American Indian on birth certificates appears
to be consistent with the selfidentification in the 1980 census. The
coverage estimates show significant undercounts in the census at these ages
that are approximately the same magnitude as the estimates for blacks at the
same ages (Passel and Robinson, 1984).
This result, coupled with the substantial
increase in American Indian births over
the several years before the census (Table 1), suggests that the parents who are
reporting their children as American Indian in the census may also be reporting
themselves as American Indian on birth
certificates so that the children’s births
are registered as American Indian.®’

°Registered births are assigned to racial groups
on the basis of the reported races of the parents
and not on the basis of a direct question of the race
of the child. Thus, for a birth to be classified as
American Indian, one or both parents must report
a race of American Indian.

?The results in Table 3 show a minor anomaly
at ages 0-2 which also appears in other racial
groups. The undercount at age 0 is substantially
less than at age 1. Examination of the census data
shows that this pattern is the result of apparent
overreporting in the census at age 0, rather than
undercounting at age 1. The census count for age 0
is 9.8 per cent greater than the count for age 1,
whereas the corresponding births are only 4.5 per
cent greater. Similar patterns of overreporting at
age 0 appear in the 1980 census for whites, blacks,
and Hispanics, but we have found no satisfactory
explanation.

At ages above 3, the patterns of reporting by American Indians are different. Through age 8, the slight “overcounts” give some indication that more
people are reporting their children as
American Indian in the census than are
reporting as American Indian on birth
certificates. At age 9, there is substantial
overreporting, too. About half of this
excess in the census is the result of “age
heaping,” rather than changing selfidentification, i.e., a substantial number
of people reported 1970 as a birth year
who were not born in 1970. Age 9 has
8.7 per cent more people than age 8, but
the corresponding births for age 9 were
actually 3.8 per cent /ess than the births
for age 8.

For the older ages in Table 3, those
from 10-29, the substantial degree of
shifting self-identification is very apparent. Table 3 shows a 37.6 per cent overcount for the age group 10-14. The
amount of changing self-identification
which occurred since birth in this cohort
is huge (over 50 per cent), since the cohort had an estimated undercount of 15
per cent in 1970! The next three 5-year
age groups also show shifts of about the
same magnitude between 1970 and
1980. The ‘“‘overcounts”’ for 1980 for the
age groups, with 1970 “undercounts” in
parentheses, are: age 15-19, 49 per cent
overcount (8 per cent undercount in
1970); age 20-24, 44 per cent overcount
(4 per cent undercount); and age 25-29,
53 per cent overcount (2 per cent overcount).

GEOGRAPHIC DIMENSIONS OF .
QUALITY OF 1980 CENSUS DATA
FOR AMERICAN INDIANS

The preceding discussion has identified demographic components of overstatement of American Indians in the

Passel and Berman

Social Biology

1980 census, but has not addressed the
question of what parts of the country experienced this overstatement. Analysis
of birth and death rates for states in
1979-81 and 1969-71 can be used to
identify specific areas where the overstatement appears to be concentrated.
Analysis of intercensal change for states
in 1970-80 and 1960-70 provides additional confirmation for the findings of
the birth and death rate analysis.

BIRTH AND DEATH RATES

American Indians have higher than
average birth rates. As Table 1 shows,
the birth rate for American Indians consistently exceeded 30 births per 1,000
population during the 1970’s while the
overall birth rate in the United States is
about 15 per 1,000. The crude death rate
for American Indians, about 7 per
1,000, is somewhat lower than the overall death rate of about 9. The low death
rate, in spite of higher than average agespecific mortality rates, is the result of a
young age distribution among American Indians.

Below the national level, birth and
death rates would be expected to vary
around these average rates, if the demographic situation were normal. However, because the situation is not normal, there is considerable variation in
state-level birth and death rates. As discussed in the previous section, the 1980
census count of American Indians
showed a high degree of “‘overcounting”’
relative to the 1970 census count. Areas
with substantial “excesses” of American
Indians would be expected to show abnormally low birth and death rates because the denominator of the rate (i.e.,
the American Indian population in the
census) is artificially inflated. Areas
without substantial overreporting would
be expected to have birth and death

Vol. 33, No. 3-4

rates in the normal range for American
Indians.

In keeping with the results of the previous analysis, the birth and death rates
of regions, divisions, and states for
1979-81, shown in Table 4, exhibit an
abnormally large range of variation
around the national rates of 25.4 and 4.8
(as shown in Table 4) and the rates of
34.9 and 6.5 (as shown in Table 1).8 The
birth rates vary from an unheard of low
level of 4.3 in West Virginia and Alabama to an extremely high value of 57.6
in Hawaii. The death rates also range
from an unprecedented low level of 0.3
in Vermont to a more normal high of 9.5
in South Dakota.

The geographic pattern of birth and
death rates is wel] defined. To identify
it, we will delineate a group of states as
“Indian states.”’ These are states that
had 3,000 or more American Indians in
the 1950 census, excluding California
which has behaved demographically
over the last three decades much like a
typical “‘non-Indian” state. This definition identified 19 states which had 87 per
cent of the American Indian population
in the 48 states in 1950. The 19 states
are: New York, Michigan, Wisconsin,
Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming,
New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada,
Washington, Oregon, and Alaska.

8The differences in national rates are the result
of differently defined denominators. In the lower
national rates (Table 4), 1980 census counts are the
denominators. In the higher ones (Table 1), estimates based on the 1970 census provide the denominators.

°Two other states might have been designated
as “Indian” states using somewhat different definitions. The two additional states are Mississippi and
Colorado. Inclusion or exclusion of these states
does not substantially affect the results of the analyses.

Census Data for American Indians 171

These states have most of the American
Indian reservations and other identified
Indian areas in the United States.

The Indian states as a group have a
birth rate of 30 and a death rate of 6 for
1979-81 (Table 4). These values are in
line with those expected on the basis of
“normal” growth in the American Indian population, as defined in Table 1.
More importantly, the birth rates are
concentrated within a fairly narrow
range of variation with most of the rates
in the low 30’s and only 2 below 20 (New
York and Michigan). The death rates in
these states include all of the higher
rates (which are in the expected range)
with only 1 rate below 4 (Michigan).

The remaining 32 non-Indian states
have a collective American Indian birth
rate of only 17. The death rate is a ridiculously low 2! Five states have birth
rates below 10 for American Indians
and 16 states (including California) have
death rates below 2. Rates this low certainly do not reflect the actual behavior
of the American Indian population. In
particular, the birth rate could not be so
low in a population which is growing as
fast as the American Indian population
apparently is; death rates this low are
virtually impossible.

The geographic pattern of birth and
death rates implies that the American
Indian population is reasonably well
defined in the ‘Indian states” (and possibly also in Colorado and Mississippi).
In these 19 states, the definition of
American Indians used in the vital statistics system appears to be consistent
with the self-identification of individuals
as American Indian in the 1980 census.
In non-Indian states, however, the
American Indian population in the census appears to be drawn from the general population. The American Indian
birth rate in the non-Indian states is ap

proximately the same as the total population. The improbably low death rate in
these states suggests that the ‘‘new”
American Indians are generally young
adults. This inference agrees remarkably well with the errors of closure
shown in Table 2 which are very large at
ages with low death rates. Indians in
California appear to be typical of the
“non-Indian”’ states with a birth rate of
15.1 and a death rate of 1.8.

Table 5 displays birth and death rates
for 1969-71. The geographic patterns
are virtually identical to those shown in
Table 4 for 1979-81, but not as extreme.
The 19 Indian states have a birth rate of
33.9 and a death rate of 8.1 for 1969-71,
whereas the 32 non-Indian states have a
birth rate of 22.7 and a death rate of only
3.3. For the Indian states, the birth rates
fall in a normal range of 25.8 to 40.4 and
the death rates from 5.5 to 11.6. For the
non-Indian states, most of the birth
rates are in the teens and 19 of the death
rates are 3 or below.

INTERCENSAL CHANGE FOR STATES

One measure of net internal migration during the 1970-80 decade can be
derived by comparing the 1980 census
count of American Indians in a state
with the 1970 census count plus American Indian births in the state during the
intercensal period less American Indian
deaths in the state:

My 99 = Po — (Pr + Bry g ~ Dy¢0):

The same measure can also be viewed as
a form of error of closure for the state.
Table 6 shows that, in the aggregate,
both Indian and non-Indian states had
net in-migration during the decade of
the 1970’s. This situation is clearly impossible in the absence of international

Census Data for American Indians 173

migration unless individual selfidentification changed during the decade.

The increase from ‘“‘internal migration” was substantially greater in percentage terms in the non-Indian states
(42.7 per cent versus 17.4 per cent). The
increase was also somewhat greater
even in absolute terms in the non-Indian
states (200,000 as compared with
165,000). This confirms the finding of
the birth and death rate analysis that
large increases in self-identification as
American Indian occurred in the nonIndian states.

Finding net in-migration into Indian
states does require an explanation. One
possibility is improved coverage in the
1980 census for these states over the
1970 census count for American Indians. This is a very real possibility since
the overall coverage of the census did
improve between 1970 and 1980 (Passel,
et al., 1983). Also, some recruitment
into the American Indian population
from shifts in self-identification probably did occur in these areas, although
the degree of shifting could not have
been nearly as great as in the non-Indian
states. This latter scenario is particularly
likely because the collection of race data
in 1980 was done almost entirely by selfidentification whereas, in 1970, the race
data in the rural West were obtained primarily by observation on the part of
enumerators. A third possibility is that
the Indian states did actually experience
in-migration of American Indians, reversing a longstanding trend of outmigration from American Indian areas.

The pattern of intercensal migration
is even more striking for the 1960-70
decade (Table 7). All of the error of closure is in non-Indian areas, 1.e., virtually
all of the shift in self-identification for
the 1960-70 decade occurred in non

Indian areas. Also, a number of the Indian states experienced out-migration of
American Indians; these states include
North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, North Carolina, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada,
and Alaska. The amount of inmigration experienced by these ten
states in the 1970-1980 decade roughly
equalled the out-migration of the previous decade. This pattern suggests that
the in-migration shown in Table 6 for
1970-80 may actually have occurred, replacing the out-migrants of the 1960’s. If
this is the case, then the overall degree
of shifting of self-identification in nonIndian states during the 1970’s must
have been even greater than shown by
Table 3.

CENSUS OPERATIONS AND PROCESSING

The 1980 census also provides a
figure for the American Indian population from the sample forms.’ The sample estimate for American Indians*
(American Indians only, excluding Eskimos and Aleuts)" of 1,478,523 significantly exceeds the 1,364,033 figure
from the complete count by over 8 per
cent. The data in Table 8 show that the
larger sample totals occurred primarily
in non-Indian states. The sample exceeded the complete count by 28,582 or
only 3.2 per cent in Indian states, but by
85,908 or 18.6 per cent in the non-Indian
states. This pattern of larger excesses in
the non-Indian states is similar to the
findings from the birth, death, and mi
The 1980 census had two different sampling
rates. In larger places, i.e., over 2,500, one-sixth of
the households received the larger sample questionnaires. In smaller places, one-half fell into the
sample. Overall, about 19 per cent of the population was in the sample.

See Footnote 1.

Census Data for American Indians 177

gration analyses of the previous sections.

When the differences between the
sample estimate and the complete count
for American Indians* are examined in
more geographical detail, an even more
striking pattern emerges. The increase
between complete count totals and sample estimates for American Indians* occurred primarily outside American Indian areas (i.e., reservations, tribal trust
lands, historic areas of Oklahoma, and
Alaska native villages). Specifically, the
sample estimate of the American Indian* population inside American Indian areas was slightly lower than the
100—-per-cent figure by about 2,000 persons or 0.4 per cent of the population
(see Table 9). Outside American Indian
areas, the American Indian* population
in the sample exceeded the 100-per-cent
figure by 116,504 or 13.4 per cent.

This pattern of excesses could have
occurred as a result of some census operations or as a result of unusual response
patterns on the part of respondents in
the sample. Detailed analyses of the
census data indicate that both of these
processes were operating to some degree. A disproportionate number of
American Indian* households fell into
the sample in most states, especially in
states with a small American Indian*
population. The states with the largest
percentage differences between the 100per cent count and the sample estimate
all had small figures for the American
Indian* population: West Virginia (49
per cent), Tennessee (39 per cent),
Arkansas (36 per cent), Georgia (33 per
cent), and Florida (31 per cent).

Some of the ‘“‘excess” in the sample
estimate for American Indians* came
from the manner in which respondents
answered the race question in the census
and the way their responses were

treated during processing phases. A review of data for selected states—
Arkansas, Vermont, Oklahoma—
showed that a portion of the increase
between the 100—per-cent figure and the
sample estimate was from persons who
were American Indian in the sample,
but another race in the 100-per—cent
data (see Table 10). Most of these persons did not fill in the pre-coded circle
for American Indian provided on the
census form as a response to the race
question, but rather wrote in an entry,
such as a tribal designation, to indicate
that they were Indian. Some of these
cases in the 100-per-cent data were left
as “other races” or allocated on race;
but, in the sample data they were coded
as American Indian. For example, in a
substantial number of the cases reviewed in Oklahoma (45 per cent), the
respondents did not fill the American
Indian circle but wrote in “Cherokee.”

Census Data for American Indians 179

This pattern suggests that there may
have been some confusion on the part of
respondents as to the intent of the race
question. The confusion could be the
result, in part, from the omission of the
word “race” from the question.

We can infer from the response patterns that for many individuals classified
as American Indian* in the census the
strength of identification as American
Indian is not great. In particular, the
multiple responses to the race item in
conjunction with write-in responses suggest that individuals were not providing
the primary racial group with which they
identified, but rather all groups with
which they felt some degree of identification. On the other hand, other persons may have identified with a particular tribe, but not with the broader group
of “American Indian” and, thus, not
have been properly classified in the 100per-cent data. Other analyses of census

operations show that the “extra” American Indians (i.e., the additional persons
in the sample as well as the excess over
numbers expected on the basis of previous censuses) were not created by
other census processing, computer errors, or census allocation procedures.
Nevertheless, the patterns of response
suggest that the design of the race item
may have contributed to overreporting
in the American Indian category.

AMERICAN INDIAN
ANCESTRY DATA

The 1980 census and the November
1979 Current Population Survey (CPS)
also provide data on the population of
American Indian descent from a question that asked individuals to provide information on their ‘“‘ancestry or descent.”” This ancestry question was
asked in addition to the race question
which provided the data analyzed to this
point. Many more people claimed some
American Indian ancestry in response to
the ancestry question than the number
who claimed to be American Indian in
response to the race question. In the November 1979 CPS, about 10 million people claimed some degree of American
Indian ancestry; in the 1980 census,
about 7 million persons did so.

The extremely large populations reporting American Indian ancestry when
compared with the race figures for
American Indians* suggest that the degree of identification as Indian on the
part of most of these people is not very
strong. The lack of strength of identification as American Indian is shown by
the tendency of persons to report an additional ancestry in addition to the
American Indian response—71 per cent
did so. This was particularly true among
persons of American Indian ancestry

Passel and Berman

who did not report American Indian*
race. About 83 per cent of the population of American Indian ancestry of
white race also reported another ances
try, usually a European ancestry. On the 
other hand, of persons who reported
both American Indian* race and ancestry, only 22 percent reported another
ancestry; 78 per cent reported only the
American Indian ancestry.

Another perspective on the same
phenomenon is given by the race distribution of persons who reported American Indian ancestry. Most of the persons
who reported American Indian in the
1980 census in response to the ancestry
item, responded as white in the race
item; about 77 per cent of the population of American Indian ancestry was
white and only 18 per cent reported
American Indian race. Of the persons
who reported a multiple ancestry which
included an American Indian ancestry,
only 5 per cent gave American Indian*
as their race, but 90 per cent reported as
white in the race item. The racial composition of persons reporting a single ancestry of American Indian was very
different—48 per cent American Indian
race and only 46 per cent white.

The tendency toward consistency in
reporting of American Indian* race and
ancestry, or the lack there of, varied depending on where people lived. Persons
inside American Indian areas were con
siderably more likely to report a single |

ancestry of American Indian than persons who lived outside American Indian
areas. The strength of identification as
American Indian was especially pronounced among persons inside American Indian areas who reported American Indian* race; 94 per cent of these
persons reported a single American Indian ancestry, whereas only 70 per cent
of such persons outside American In

dian areas reported a single American
Indian ancestry.

Although the majority of persons
who reported American Indian ancestry
did not report American Indian* race,
most persons classified as American Indian* race did report their ancestry as
American Indian. About 80 per cent of
persons with American Indian* race reported an American Indian ancestry—
62 per cent a single ancestry and 17 per
cent a multiple ancestry (see Table 11).
Another 11 per cent reported a nonIndian ancestry and 9 per cent did not
report an ancestry. The proportions varied greatly according to the reported
tribes, as shown in Table 11. Of the largest tribes—Navajo, Lumbee, Papago,
and Pueblo—an overwhelming majority, more than 80 per cent, reported a
single American Indian ancestry. Okla

homa tribes such as Chickasaw, Cherokee, and Choctaw had much smaller
proportions reporting a single American
Indian ancestry with correspondingly
larger proportions reporting multiple
ancestries and non-Indian ancestries.
The Cherokee had only 52 per cent reporting a single American Indian ancestry. Among persons who did not specify
or report a tribe, over 20 per cent reported a non-Indian ancestry only and
the proportion reporting a single Indian
ancestry was only about 45 per cent.
The large number of persons with
some degree of American Indian ancestry provides a vast pool of people who
might say that they are American Indian
in response to the race question. Obviously, in the 1980 census the number of
persons who did so increased substantially from the 1970 census. The reasons

why this happened are not at all clear,
but some possibilities include the form
of the race question, real economic incentives for being American Indian in
some states, reduced discrimination
against American Indians, increased
willingness to self-identify as American
Indian, and increased use of selfenumeration in the census, as well as a
myriad of other possibilities.

IMPLICATIONS FOR
DATA USERS

The analyses of American Indian
data from the 1980 census presented
here suggest that users exercise considerable caution in using and interpreting
data on the American Indian population. Users must be aware of the method
of data collection and of the possible deficiencies in the data. Data for American
Indians are probably of good quality in
the areas we have delineated as “Indian
states” and in identified American Indian areas. Self-identification as American Indian in areas which historically
have had substantial American Indian
populations seems to provide a reasonable basis for defining the population.

On the other hand, in areas which we
have designated as “non-Indian,” the
1980 census figures probably greatly
overstate the American Indian popula
Social Biology

tion as defined with more objective
measures. For these areas especially, users must exercise caution in interpreting
and using 1980 census data on American
Indians. One indicator which users may
find helpful is the American Indian population who provided a tribal designation in the 1980 census. In general, the
population with a tribal designation
(possibly excluding those who responded “Cherokee”’) appears to represent persons who would have responded
as American Indian in previous censuses
and vital statistics.

The Census Bureau is pursuing a program of research and evaluation that
may avoid similar problems with American Indian data and race data in general
for the 1990 census. A number of alternative formulations of the race item are
being tested. The tests include small focus groups, a National Content Test
and accompanying reinterview studies
in 1986, the 1986 test census, and a national test planned for 1987.
