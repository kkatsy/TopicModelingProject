The Span of Reproduction in Egypt

Amelia Dale Horne?’

ABSTRACT: This study shows long reproductive spans to be associated with low levels of
women’s education, rural residence, remarriage, early marriage age, and high parity. Effects

are statistically significant.

Until recently, research on the timing
of- fertility events has been concerned
mainly with the beginning of the reproductive period, i.e., age at marriage or
maternal age at the birth of the first child
(Bulatao, 1984; El-Guindy, 1971;
Henry and Piotrow, 1979; Kafafi, 1983;
Kiernan and Diamond, 1983; Trussell
and Bloom, 1983). Lately, interest has
developed in the end of the childbearing
period, as descriptive and covariate
studies on maternal age at the birth of
the last child and descriptive studies of
the length of the reproductive span have
been done (Chinguwo, 1986; Horne,
1985; Horne and El-Khorazaty, 1985,
1987a,b; Horne and El-Khorazaty, and
Suchindran, 1986; Horne and Suchindran, 1985, 1988; Jing-Guo, 1986;
Krishnamoorthy, 1979; McDonald,
1984; Saleh, 1987; Suchindran and
Horne, 1984; Suchindran, et al., 1985;
Yali, 1987).

The age at which women end childbearing determines the length of the reproductive span, and both age at last
birth and reproductive span have important health, social, and demographic associations. Horne and El-Khorazaty
(1985, 1987a,b) and Horne et al. (1986)

“Dr. Horne is currently a free-lance statistical
consultant in Bahrain. She was formerly with the
American University in Cairo, Egypt.

examined time trends and differentials
in age at last birth and length of reproductive span in Egypt, other Arab countries, and other developing countries
and found both to be positively correlated with both fertility and mortality.

McDonald (1984) suggested age at
last birth as the best societal-level predictor of fertility, but Horne and EIKhorazaty (1985, 1987a) and Horne et
al. (1986) found the length of the reproductive span to be an even better
societal-level predictor of fertility (as
well as of mortality) than either the
mean age at last birth or the well-known
mean age at childbearing. This finding is
understandable, since neither age at first
birth nor age at last birth alone ultimately determines final parity, but
rather the interval between the two and
the pace of childbearing within the interval. This is especially true in a society
such as Egypt, in which there is very little deliberate spacing of births, and most
women who use birth control methods
do so only after they have had all the
children they want (CAPMAS, 1983b;
Khalifa et al., 1982).

For these reasons, research on the
length of the childbearing period can
provide valuable insights, particularly
about countries with little birth spacing.
While a covariate analysis has been
done on age at last birth (Horne and Suchindran, 1988), there has been no pre

vious covariate study done on the length
of the reproductive span. In the present
paper, a regression model is used to examine the associations in Egypt between
women’s education, current residence,
and marital dissolution and the length of
time spent in childbearing.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data from the 1980 Egyptian Fertility Survey (EFS)(CAPMAS, 1983a)
contain the dates of birth of every child
for each woman interviewed. The
length of the reproductive span
(RSPAN), obtained by subtracting the
date of the first birth from that of the
last, was calculated. Women who had
borne less than two children at the time
of the survey were excluded from analysis, as were women who had had only
two children which were twins.

The hypotheses that were tested are
the following:

(1) Well-educated women tend to have
shorter childbearing spans than less
educated women.

. (2) Women in rural areas tend to spend
more time in childbearing than urban
women.

(3) Marital disruption without remarriage tends to shorten the reproductive span.

(4) Marital disruption with remarriage
tends to lengthen the time spent in
childbearing.

For the sake of simplicity, marital disruption was considered only for the first
marriage, and a first union was defined
as dissolved if a woman said that she was
divorced, widowed, or separated.
Table 1 gives mean length of the reproductive span by various characteristics of the women interviewed. On a univariate basis, i.e., without considering
simultaneously the effects of other vari

ables, length of the span was longer in
rural than in urban areas, decreased
with education and age at marriage, and
increased with final parity. Marital dissolution with remarriage lengthened the
span, while dissolution without remarriage tended to shorten it.

Regression analysis was the methodology used to consider the women’s
characteristics simultaneously. Women’s number of years of schooling
(WYRSED) was used to assess the effect of education on the length of the reproductive span. Qualitative variables
concerned residence and marital disruption. If current residence was in rural areas, RESIDENCE was given a code of
1, and if urban residence, a code of -1. If
the first marriage was still intact at the
time of the interview, the variable
MARI was coded 1 and MAR2 coded 0.
If the first union was dissolved and the
woman had remarried, then MAR1 was
coded 0 and MAR2 coded 1. For those
with a dissolved first marriage who had
not remarried, both variables were coded -1, to allow interpretation of the regression coefficients as deviations from
the overall mean length of the reproductive span.

The effects of age at first marriage
(AGEMAR) and final parity (PARITY), treated as quantitative variables,
were controlled for since they are
known to be associated with the response variable.

Spearman correlation coefficients for
the independent variables (Table 2) indicate low correlation among them, except for marital experience (-0.62). But
since this degree of correlation is only
borderline for exclusion from the
model, and marital disruption is critical
to the length of the reproductive span,
these variables were retained in the
analysis.

Since the measurement of reproductive span is more accurate for women in
the oldest cohort (age 45-49), a multiple
regression model for the 830 women in
this group only was developed. The
model fitted for the i-th woman in the
data set is

RSPAN; = By + 81 AGEMAR; + B>
PARITY; + 83 WYRSED; + RESIDENCE; + Bs MARI; + Be
MAR2; + RESIDUAL).

Examination of plots of residuals from
the fitted model suggested no violation
of the assumptions underlying regression analysis.

RESULTS

The estimated regression surface obtained is

RSPAN = 11.255 -0.306 AGEMAR + 1.326 PARITY — 0.107
WYRSED + 0.389 RESIDENCE
+ 0.243 MARI + 1.465 MAR2.

Table 3 gives other results from the
fitted regression. The F-value attests

Social Biology

that there is a regression relation between the dependent and independent
variables. The R? value indicates that 57
per cent of the variation in reproductive
span is accounted for by the set of independent variables in the model.

Since alternatives to the null hypotheses are one-sided, one-sided p-values
were computed for testing the individual
hypothesis that B; = 0. (These p-values,
based on the t-statistic, b/S(b;), provide
marginal tests. There are no inferences
made about the joint significance of the
coefficients.) When all other variables in
the model were controlled, wife’s years
of schooling had a negative effect on the
length of the reproductive span, significant at the 0.05 level. An increase of
one year of education was associated
with a decrease of 0.11 of a year in mean
reproductive span.

Current residence in rural areas was
associated with longer spans of childbearing than the overall span, while residence in urban regions had the reverse
effect. Rural residence was associated
with a mean span of about 0.39 of a year
longer than the overall average, and urban residence, 0.39 of a year shorter.

Women whose first marriages were
still intact tended to have reproductive
spans not significantly different from the
overall mean (p-value = 0.1282). This
result is expected since the vast majority
of the women belonged to this group.
Those with dissolved marriages who had
remarried had the longest spans of all—
about 1.5 years longer than the overall
mean span. The corresponding statistics
were calculated for the omitted category, i.e., those with dissolved first unions who had not remarried by the time
of the interview. These women had
spans of about 1.7 years shorter than the
overall average. These findings imply
that the marriages which had dissolved
without remarriage tended to do so before the women had completed the
childbearing period, and that women
who remarried were inclined to produce
children from their new unions.

Reproductive span tended to decrease as age at first marriage increased.
An increase of one year in age at marriage was associated with a reduction of
about 0.31 of a year in mean length of
the reproductive span.

Longer spans were associated with
higher parity. Each additional child extended the mean reproductive span an
average of 1.33 years. Since a birth interval must be at least 0.75 of a year (for
full-term births), this small change in
length of the span manifests a predominant lack of birth spacing among Egyptian women.

CONCLUSIONS

Results of the present study show
long reproductive spans to be associated
with low levels of women’s education,
residence in rural areas, remarriage after being divorced or widowed, early
age at marriage, and high parity. Effects

Reproduction in Egypt

259

of these variables are statistically significant, although the magnitudes of some
effects appear to be small demographically.

It will be remembered, however, that
the analysis was done only on women
aged 45 to 49 in Egypt in 1980. These
women began reproducing at a time
when birth rates were relatively high because of the post-World War II Baby
Boom, and differences in fertility between urban and rural areas were small.
The housing shortage, increased status
of women, etc., in urban areas of Egypt
in recent years can be expected to manifest themselves by increasing the effects
of the independent variables on the
length of the reproductive span for
younger cohorts of women.

This widening of the effect of residence, for example, is observed in regard to age at first birth (not shown),
which, it will be recalled, is acomponent
of the length of reproductive span.
While percentage distributions of age at
first birth between urban and rural
women aged 45 to 49 (X’5 = 3.38) are
not significantly different, for women
aged 25 to 29 the percentage having first
birth at an early age is significantly lower
among urban women (X?; = 75.49)
(Horne and Suchindran, 1985).

An increase in the magnitude of the
effect of education also can be expected
for younger cohorts of women, as similar mechanisms causing the divergency
by residence also should widen the differences by education. Bulatao (1984, p.
16) reports that on a worldwide basis,
and in Egypt in particular, “the differentials in fertility between education
groups increase .. . as fertility transition progresses.”

Thus, results of the present analysis
on Egyptian women aged 45 to 49,
which are statistically significant, are ex

pected to become even more so for
younger cohorts of Egyptian women.
Since the analysis reveals that longer
reproductive spans are associated with
higher final parity—a result that is not
tautological, as this positive association
is not always found in developed countries with a high degree of contraceptive
use and deliberate birth spacing (Suchindran et. al., 1985)}—the implication
is that in addition to the widely proposed
raising Of the legal age at marriage, a
lowering of the age at last birth, and
thereby a shortening of the reproductive
span from the upper end, also can be encouraged while not legislated, in order
to reduce fertility in high fertility countries. Information/education campaigns
can effectively broadcast the health, social, and demographic disadvantages of
bearing children at old maternal ages
(Fortney et al., 1982; Omran and Johnston, 1984; Younis et al., 1979). In 1982,
21 per cent of all live births in Egypt

Social Biology

were born to women aged 35 and older,
and of these births 79 per cent were birth
orders 4 and over (United Nations,
1988). Thus, reducing the percentage of
births to women over age 35 can have a
significant impact in reducing population growth and maternal and infant
mortality rates.

Since the magnitude of the effect of
education ts anticipated to increase
among younger cohorts of women, policies designed to increase educational
opportunities for women are expected
to reduce the length of the reproductive
span. But, as the results for the cohort
age 45-49 show that increasing education from none to nine years of schooling reduced the reproductive span, on
average, by about one year, and as Bulatao (1984) suggests, increasing women’s education to at least the secondary
level may be required to have significant
impacts of fertility.
