Abortion: A Hypothesis on the Role of
ABO Blood Groups and Placental

Alkaline Phosphatase

Spontaneous abortion has been shown
to be associated with both ABO incompatibility (Takano and Miller, 1972;
British Medical Journal, 1972) and placental alkaline phosphatase (Pl) genotype
(G. Beckman et al., 1972).

Data collected by our group during the
past five years (Bottini et al. 1972a;
1972b; 1972c) have shown a complex
interaction between the polymorphism of
placental alkaline phosphatase and that of
the ABO system. This interaction, confirmed at the population Ievel by Ananthakrishnan et al. (1974), suggests a
cooperative role of ABO and PI factors in
the maintenance of the fertilized ovum in
utero.

It is likely, however, that spontaneous
abortion represents only a facet of a
process of selection which starts early in
intrauterine life and continues later on
with abortion and neonatal jaundice
(Mourant, 1972). Moreover, since it is
known that two other factors, Rh and
haptoglobin (Hp), interact with ABO
during intrauterine life (Levine, 1959;
Cohen, 1970; Ritter and Hinkelmann,
1966; Kirk et al., 1970) and that Hp
interacts with P] (Ananthakrishnan et al.,

1974), at least four polymorphic systems
may intervene simultaneously in this
process.

In this report, an outline of our observations on ABO and PI interactions is
presented, and some hypotheses are suggested on the possible role played by placental alkaline phosphatase and ABO
blood groups in the maternal-fetal relationship.

THE INTERACTION BETWEEN ABO
AND PL POLYMORPHISMS

Placental alkaline phosphatase is a polymorphic glycoprotein normally produced
only during fetal life. Its synthesis is controlled by an autosomal locus with three
common codominant alleles (PI‘t, Pl*t,
and Pl'1), Correspondingly, there are six
common electrophoretic phenotypes (S,F,
ISF,SI and FI). The enzyme, produced
by the fetal part of the placenta, appears
early in gestation in the maternal circulation where it persists for several weeks
after delivery (Boyer, 1961; Robson
and Harris, 1965; Robson and Harris,
1967; Sussman et al., 1968), The enzymatic activities associated with the three
common alleles Pl’, Pl*:, and Plt, are in

the following ratio (placental extracts):
0.90:0.81:0.33.

The observations indicating an interaction between PI and ABO polymorphisms
are derived from a study carried out on
newbom infants from various populations
living in New Haven, Connecticut. Sampling and biochemical methods are described in a previous paper (Bottini et al.,
1972c). The most relevant data obtained
by our group up to now are shown in
Tables 1 and 2.

The data in Table 1 show an association
between PI and ABO system phenotypes;
the pattern of this association is influenced by the presence of feto-maternal
blood group incompatibility (in the ABO
and/or Rh system). The distribution of
Pl alleles and phenotypes in newborn infants compatible with their mothers in

Social Biology

both systems (ABO and Rh) depends upon
the fetal ABO phenotype. Newborns
with blood group B show a proportion of
phenotypes carriers of allele Pl*t which is
significantly lower than expected. The
pattern is different in newborn infants
incompatible with their mothers in the
ABO and/or Rh system. In this group,
the proportion of phenotype carriers of
allele Pl‘! in infants with blood group B is
significantly higher than in infants compatible with their mothers. These findings
are more apparent in first-born infants.
The analysis of the incidence of fetomaternal isoimmunization in infants incompatible with their mothers in the ABO
system, in relation to the Pl phenotype
(Table 2), has shown that in newborn
infants incompatible in the B group the
signs of isoimmunization (i.e., a positive

less frequent in infants who are carriers
of allele Pl‘t,

Further evidence in favor of an interaction between the ABO and PI polymorphisms was obtained by our group
from the analysis of the correlations between the Pl and ABO system gene frequencies in 19 different human populations.
This analysis has shown a negative correlation between I? and Plft gene frequencies
(Bottini et al., 1972¢) which is in agreement with the observations in the newborn population.

The data on compatible subjects, reported in Table 1 suggest a heterogeneity
of the interaction between ABO and Pl
polymorphisms among different populations. Indeed, the distortion of phenotype
distribution seems very strong in Negroes,
in which the frequency of Pl‘! is very low,
and relatively weak in Jews in which the
frequency of Pl‘! is very high (Bottini
et al., 19722). It is interesting that a
heterogeneity of the relationship between
the frequency of spontaneous abortion
and the presence of Pl*: factor has been
observed by L. Beckman et al. (1969;
1972).

As previously discussed (Bottini et al.,
1972c), the most likely interpretation of
our results is that of an interaction between the Pl and ABO polymorphisms
with strong selective effects. The presence

of the Pl‘: allele, which is associated with
the highest enzymatic activity, is advantageous for B-group individuals incompatible with the mother in the ABO
system. On the other hand, in the absence of blood group incompatibility, the
B-group subjects carrying allele Pl‘ are
at a disadvantage. Since our data were
obtained from a newborn population, they
should reflect a selection operating during
intrauterine life; the lethal effects of this
selection should produce significant distortions in the phenotype distribution.
However, in subjects with ABO incompatibility, these selective forces also continue
to operate during extrauterine life with
significant effects on P] and ABO phenotypes. Therefore, although an interaction
between P] and ABO is present both in
compatible and incompatible subjects, the
pattern observed in incompatible infants
is symmetric with that observed in the
compatible ones.

From our observations, an excess of P}‘1
in spontaneous abortions might be expected. In fact, this excess has been reported by G. Beckman et al. (1972).

HYPOTHESIS ON THE ROLE OF ABO
BLOOD GROUPS AND PLACENTAL
ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE IN THE
MATERNAL-FETAL RELATIONSHIP

Our data are consistent with the suggestion of Robson and Harris (1965) that
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

224. Bottini

the Pl polymorphism may play a role in
the maternal-fetal interactions. More specifically, it is possible that placental alkaline phosphatase has some function in
blastocyst implantation and/or the maintenance of the fetus in utero. Actually, the
striking deficiency of the Pl‘1 allele in subjects of group B, observed in compatible
infants, suggests a role of both Pl and
ABO factors in the implantation and/or in
the maintenance of the developing embryo
in utero.

L. Beckman (1968) has suggested that
the release of glycoproteins from the cell is
related to the ABO genotype. On the basis
of this theory, it is possible that the pattern of variability of enzymatic activity
and/or of some cellular structure dependent upon the Pl polymorphism is different
among ABO genotypes. In this way, the
ABO system could indirectly regulate some
function of placental alkaline phosphatase.

The action of the Pl factor may be immunological in nature. This hypothesis is
supported by two circumstances: (1) The
pattern of Pl-ABO interaction is less clear
in the pregnancies following the first. This
finding is consistent with the experimental
evidence suggesting that the immunological response of the mother to her partner’s
antigens may undergo significant changes
with subsequent pregnancies (Breyere and
Barret, 1961). (2) The pattern of Pl-ABO
interaction is dependent on the maternalfetal incompatibility status in the ABO
system, showing a drastic change when
considering compatible babies vs. incompatible ones.

SITES AND MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF
PLACENTAL ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE
The function of placental alkaline phosphatase could take place through a physicochemical interaction with fetal antigens
and/or through an action on the maternal
immunocompetent system. In this respect,

 

Social Biology

the action of Pl alleles could be related
with the corresponding enzymatic activity;
it could also be dependent upon the
amount of glycoprotein as a structural
component of the trophoblast membrane.

The action of PAP could take place (1)
in the layer of trophoblast cells that separates maternal from fetal tissues and/or
(2) in the maternal organism.

Possible action in the trophoblast —
According to some views, the sialomucin
(glycocalyx) which covers the trophoblast
cells may have important functions in
the maternal-fetal interaction (Billington,
1969; Simmons, 1969; Kirby, 1969;
Currie, 1968; Curzen, 1970; Currie, 1970;
Wynn, 1971; Beer and Billingham, 1971).
It has been suggested that this layer
masks antigens on the trophoblast membrane, thereby contributing to the immunological isolation of the conceptus.

On the other hand, an incomplete masking of the antigenic structures of the
trophoblast membrane could be advantageous for several reasons. Implantation
is associated with local inflammatory reaction (Beer and Billingham, 1971).
Fetuses unlike their mothers may have
increased chance of survival (Clarke and
Kirby, 1966), and genetical dissimilarity
with the mother seems to favor the implantation of the blastocyst (Kirby, 1970).
It has also been suggested that ABOcompatible male blastocysts could implant
more successfully than females owing to
differences with their mothers in Y-linked
antigens. This suggestion is in part supported by data on the sex ratio (Kirby,
1970). Placental “enhancement” may be a
contributing factor in the maintenance of
the developing embryo in utero (Beer and
Billingham, 1971).

It is possible that the variability—for
example, on a genetic basis—of some structural property of the sialomucin coat of

Vol. 22, No. 3

the trophoblast could affect the implantation of the blastocyst and the maintenance in utero of the fetus. A heuristic
scheme may be as follows. An excess of
mucopolysaccharide increases the immunological isolation of the fetus and therefore is advantageous in the presence of
maternal-fetal blood group incompatibility. On the other hand, an excessive
“masking” effect on fetal antigens impairs some maternal reactions which may
be very important for blastocyst implantation and/or for the maintenance of the
fetus in utero.

The trophoblast membrane is very rich
in alkaline phosphatase (Wachstein et al.,
1963) and placental alkaline phosphatase
has a very high content of sialic acid
(Robson and Harris, 1967). These two
observations suggest that placental alkaline phosphatase may contribute to the
biochemical constitution of the sialomucin
coat of the trophoblast and could therefore be responsible for a structural and
functional variability of this pericellular
layer.

Possible action in the maternal organism.—The enzyme present in the maternal circulation could act on the maternal
immunocompetent cells, interfering with
their response to fetal antigens. It is also
possible that the enzyme interacts with
fetal antigens, thereby changing their
antigenic properties. Finally, the circulating enzyme could block already formed
maternal antibodies.

Women with rheumatoid arthritis often
show a Clinical remission of the disease
during pregnancy (Beer and Billingham,
1971; Persellin et al., 1971), and it has
been suggested that subsidence of inflammation could be due to a serum component which stabilizes leucocyte lysosomes
(Persellin et al., 1971).

Some glycoproteins can inhibit the lym

phocyte response to phytohemagglutinin
(PHA). Besides an alphaglobulin present
in adult serum (Cooperband et al., 1969),
2 placental glycoprotein fraction and some
preparations of human chorionic gonadotropin also possess this property (Riggio
et al., 1971; Adcock et al., 1973). Moreover, during pregnancy, both a reduction
in maternal lymphocyte response to PHA
and a depressant action of plasma on
normal lymphocytes stimulated by PHA
have been reported (Leikin, 1971; Purtilo
et al., 1972; Hill et al., 1973; Yu et al.,
1975). A high rosette inhibition titre in
pregnant mice has been also reported
(Morton et al., 1974).

If PAP has a role in depressing the maternal lymphocyte responsivity during
pregnancy, the intensity of such depression should be a function of both Pl] and
ABO types of the fetus. In particular, the
lowest degree of responsivity should be
found in mothers pregnant with a B fetus
carrying the Pl‘t factor.

Since PAP and HCG are glycoproteins
produced by the trophoblast cells and both
are poured in the maternal circulation, it
is also conceivable that Pl and ABO factors may exert their effects through interactions with the release of HCG, the latter
being the active substance.

SEX RATIO OF COMPATIBLE NEWBORNS
OF GROUP B

An important point in the hypothesis
presented in this paper is the assumption
that the ABO genotype influences some
structural and functional expressions of
P] polymorphism which are relevant in the
maternal-fetal relationship. In general, carriers of B factor may show a better immunological isolation and/or a lower responsivity of maternal lymphocytes. Assuming
that blastocysts carrying chromosome Y
are on the average more antigenically dissimilar from their mothers than XX blasDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

226 Bottini

tocysts, the proportion of males in compatible infants of B phenotype should be
higher than in the other ABO phenotypes.
The data reported in Table 3 agree with
this expectation, therefore offering some
support to the validity of the hypothesis.

PLACENTAL ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE
AND CANCER

In the context of the hypothesis presently suggested, it is interesting to note
that in a number of adults with malignant
tumors it is possible to detect a fraction
of alkaline phosphatase which has physico-chemical properties very similar to
those of the placental one (Fishman et al.,
1968). This fraction is present both in the
plasma and in the neoplastic tissue and
may be involved in the maintenance of
the tumor cells in the patient in a manner
similar to that suggested for the success of
the fetus as a homograft in its mother.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Spontaneous abortion is associated with
both ABO incompatibility and placental
alkaline phophatase genotype. Since we
have recently shown an interaction between the polymorphisms of these two

Social Biology

systems, it is likely that Pl] and ABO factors do not act independently.

The interaction between human placental alkaline phosphatase (Pl) and ABO
system polymorphisms is supported (1)
by the distribution of Pl alleles (Pl*, Pl‘,
Pl't) among ABO phenotypes in newborn
infants, (2) by the association between Pl
phenotype and Coombs test positivity
and/or jaundice in newborn infants incompatible with their mothers in the ABO
system, and (3) by the correlation between gene frequencies of these two polymorphisms in human populations. These
observations suggest that individuals of B
phenotype, compatible with their mothers
in the blood group systems and carrying
Plfi allele, undergo a strong negative selection during intrauterine life. In incompatible individuals, the pattern is reversed,
and the frequency of some manifestations
of ABO incompatibility is lower in Bphenotype infants carrying the Pl‘ allele.
Our data are in accordance with those of
G. Beckman et al. (1972) which show a
very high frequency of Pl‘! factor in spontaneous abortions.

It is suggested that placental alkaline

phosphatase may contribute to the immunological isolation of the fetus and/or act
as a moderator of the maternal reactions
toward alien fetal antigens.

According to this hypothesis, the action
of alkaline phosphatase could take place
in the trophoblast layer and/or in the
maternal tissues. The enzyme may contribute to the structure of the sialomucin
coat (glycocalix) of the trophoblast. An
excess of this mucopolysaccharide layer
could increase the immunological isolation
of the fetus and therefore could be advantageous in the presence of maternal-fetal
group incompatibility. On the other hand,
an excessive masking effect on fetal antigens could impair the local reaction at the
site of implantation and/or the production
of maternal antibodies which may induce
a placental enhancement. Therefore, it
could represent a relative disadvantage
for individuals compatible with their
mothers. In the maternal circulation, placental alkaline phosphatase may interact
with fetal antigens and/or act directly on
the maternal immunocompetent cells. The
ABO genotype could regulate the release
of placental alkaline phosphatase from
trophoblast cells and therefore could influence some structural and functional
expressions of Pl polymorphism.

Abortion: ABO System and Pl Genotype

227

The analysis of males proportion among
ABO phenotypes has shown the highest
value in B-compatible subjects. This observation supports the hypothesis presented here that Pl and ABO factors play
a role in blastocyst implantation and/or
in the maintenance of the fetus in utero.

The present attempt to bring together
facts and hypotheses from different fields
of biology may help to devise a new approach to the maternal-fetal relationship.
As pointed out recently by Mourant
(1972), further studies in this area should
take into account ABO, Rh, Pl, and Hp
and their interactions. Such investigations
would be of interest from a_ theoretical
point of view in elucidating the forces
which maintain the above-mentioned polymorphisms and their role in the maternalfetal relationship. From a practical point
of view, such investigations may provide
ways to prevent the damages of maternalfetal blood group incompatibility. Furthermore, the identification of physiological factors which regulate the reactions
against alien antigens may have important
applications in the general field of immunology.
