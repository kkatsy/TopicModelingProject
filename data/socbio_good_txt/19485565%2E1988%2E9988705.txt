Effect of Late Familiarization
on Human Mating Preferences

 

Thomas H. Thelen

Department of Biological Sciences,

Ellensburg, Washington

ABSTRACT: Male and female students were asked to select from groups of photographs
projected on slides the individual preferred as a mate in a long-term husband-wife relationship.
The students were later shown some of the same photographs several times to familiarize them
with these individuals. The students were subsequently shown the same groups of photographs
from which they initially indicated mating preferences and were again asked to indicate their
preferences. When familiarization immediately preceded the final preference selections, both
male and female students switched preferences and chose individuals with whom they had been
familiarized approximately twice as often as they switched preferences and chose individuals
with whom they had not been familiarized. When familiarization preceded the final preference
selection by seven days, the frequency of switching and choosing the familiar type did not

 

 

increase. These results and the possible evolutionary basis for the results are discussed.

Many proposals have been made to
account for why an individual selects a
particular person as a mate. Some proposals are quite complex. Klimek
(1979), for example, suggests that the
basic personality is established during
the early years of life and is developed
by the conscious and unconscious interaction with the first significant human,
usually the mother. The quality of this
relationship, he adds, becomes the prototype for all other intimate relationships. As this first relationship is renounced during adolescence, definite
unconscious preferences, attractions,
and revulsions emerge towards “types”
of people.

Some hold to a Freudian point of
view and suggest that individuals may
seek as marital partners those persons
who resemble their opposite-sex parents; that is, a man will seek as a wife
someone who resembles in appearance

his mother, whereas a woman will seek
as a husband someone who resembles
her father (Duck and Miell, 1983). Others suggest that people carry in their
minds some impression of their own attractiveness to others and that they seek
as mates someone who falls within their
own level of attractiveness (Berscheid
and Walster, 1974). There are some
who suggest that preferences are based
on the notion that opposites attract,
while others insist that we are attracted
to those very similar to us (Mullan,
1984; Buss, 1985).

Like many other complex types of
behavior, the basis for mating preferences seems to develop early in life. A
proposal by Westermarck (1891) to account for incest avoidance in humans focuses on this critical period of early development. He suggests that an aversion
to mating arises between people reared
together during childhood and that this

251

familiarization is the means by which
human populations avoid inbreeding
and its associated deleterious effects.
Studies involving Israeli kibbutzim
(Shepher, 1971) and sim-pua marriages
in Taiwan (Wolf, 1966) lend support to
this proposal and indicate that the critical period of familiarization occurs between the ages of two to six (van den
Berghe, 1983).

The effects of early familiarization on
mating have also been studied in organisms other than man. Some of these
studies tend to support the idea that a
mating aversion exists toward those with
whom the individual was familiarized
early in life. Studies by Bateson (1978)
with Japanese quail, for example, have
shown that both males and females prefer to associate (and assumedly mate)
with those individuals of the opposite
sex they had not seen during rearing in
preference to those they had.

Other studies involving crossfostering also show that early familiarization influences mating and mate
choice. Studies with ducks (Schutz,
1965), quail (Gallagher, 1977), finches
(Immelmann et al., 1978), and doves
and pigeons (Warriner et al., 1963;
Brosset, 1971), for example, show that
these birds develop increased preference for members of a related species or
color variant when they are raised by
this species or color variant. Much the
same has been found in studies involving
a variety of rodents (D’udine and Aller,
1983). Apparently, normal nonmanipulated rearing acts to establish mate preferences and therefore set reproductive
limits in these species.

A study by Cato and Mug (1984) suggests that the effect of the early familiarization can diminish with time. They
found that mate preferences for the
rearing type in zebra finches decreased

 

 

Social Biology

as a period of isolation between rearing
and mate preference testing increased.
Since the effects of early familiarization
can apparently diminish, it seems reasonable that these effects might be reinforced by familiarization later in life.

In humans where the capacity for
learning throughout life is so great and
the life span prior to mating is so long, it
is reasonable that contacts later in life
might influence mating preferences.
Therefore, it seems reasonable that late
familiarization (through repeated social
contact) could act to reinforce aversions
or preferences established early in life,
or that late familiarization could initiate
new mating preferences.

The present study was undertaken to
ascertain whether late familiarization
does in fact affect human mating preferences. Students were asked to select
from photographs displayed on each of
an initial series of projected slides the individual preferred as a mate in a longterm relationship. They were subsequently shown some of the same photographs on another series of slides used to
familiarize them with selected individuals. After being familiarized and one
week after first indicating mating preferences, the students were shown slides
displaying the same groups of photographs that were used initially. From
these slides they were again asked to indicate their mate preferences. Data was
then analyzed to determine whether the
familiarization increased or decreased
the rate at which individuals were selected as preferred mates.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Male and female college students
from ten sections of an introductory biology class were separated by sex and
shown sets of slides displaying colored

Vol. 35, No. 3-4

photographs of high-school seniors from
a distant part of the country. The males
were shown two sets of slides displaying
photographs of females, and the females
were shown two sets of slides displaying
photographs of males. Except for the
fact that they displayed photographs of
the opposite sex, the composition of the
slides shown to the females was the
same as those shown to the males.

The first sets of slides were shown to
students one week before the second
sets. Some of the slides in each of the
sets displayed instructions, whereas the
others displayed photographs used either for selecting preferred mates or for
ranking individuals for a variety of characteristics. The ranking was important
to the study only to the extent that it
served to familiarize students with the
photographs of certain individuals.

The information on the instructional
slides was read out loud to the students
as it was being projected. The slides
used for selecting mates were projected
in the dark for approximately ten seconds, and for an additional five seconds
with dim overhead lighting. The slides
used in ranking were projected in the
same way, but for fifteen and ten second
intervals, respectively.

The general composition of the first
slide sets shown to students is described
below. The set shown specifically to the
males is represented graphically in Figure 1.

The first slide sets began with general
instructions. The initial slide stated that
the students were beginning a two-phase
study in which they would see photographs of individuals projected from
slides. It stated that they would be asked
to select from some of the slides the one
individual they would prefer as their
mate in a long-term husband-wife relationship and that from other slides they

253

would be asked to rank individuals according to age, sociability, or aggression. The second slide stated that all
photographs were of Caucasians, which
was a reflection of the population from
which the photographs were obtained
and was not intended as a slight to any
ethnic group. It also stated that since
many of the photographs would be
shown more than once, the students
should judge the photographs relative to
the group they were in. The third slide
stated that the students should not make
comments or look at the responses of
others during the course of the study.

The next four slides dealt with mate
preferences. The first of these slides was
instructional. It stated that the next
three slides would show photographs of
individuals and that the students were to
select from each slide one individual
they would prefer as their mate in a
long-term husband-wife relationship.
The three following slides, slides A1~
C1, then displayed the photographs of
twelve individuals, with four photographs on each slide. The four photographs on these and all slides used to indicate mate preferences were randomly
assigned to the positions in two rows of
two. Also, each of the four photographs
on these and all mate preference slides
was expected on the basis of preliminary
studies to be selected as the preferred
mate by at least 10 per cent of the participants.

The next three slides involved ranking. The first of the three stated that the
next two slides would show photographs
of three individuals and that the students were to rank the individuals
shown on each slide according to age
(from youngest to oldest). Two photographs from each of slides Al, B1, and
Cl were randomly selected for use in
producing the two slides which fol

lowed, slides D1 and E1. Slide D1 was
produced by randomly selecting and using three of the six photographs. Slide

_E1 was produced using the other three.

These and all slides used for ranking
randomly assigned the photographs to
positions in a single row of three.

Another three slides dealing with
ranking followed. The first was similar
to the previous informational slide, only
it asked the students to rank the individuals on each of the next two slides according to perceived sociability (most to
least). The following two slides, slides
Fl and G1, were produced using the
same six photographs used on slides D1
and El. Slide Fl was produced after
randomly selecting a new and unique
group of three from the six photographs.
Slide G1 was produced from the remaining three.

Three more slides involved with
ranking followed. The first was again informational and was similar to others
preceding it except that it asked the students to rank the individuals on each of
the next two slides according to perceived aggressiveness (most to least).
The following slides, slides H1 and I1,
were produced using the same six photographs used on slides D1 and E1. Slide
H1] was produced by again randomly selecting a new and unique group of three
from the six photographs, and slide I1
was produced from the remaining three.

The last four slides again dealt with
mate preferences. The first of these
slides provided the same instructions
concerning mate selection as the instructional slide preceding slides A1—C1. The
three following slides, slides J1—-L1, displayed the photographs of twelve new
individuals, with four photographs per
slide.

The general composition of the slide

Human Mating Preferences

255

sets shown to students a week later is described below. The set shown specifically to the males is represented graphically in Figure 2.

The second sets of slides were similar
to the first. They began with three slides
containing general instructions similar
to those on the first slide sets except that
the students were informed that this was
the second and last phase of the study
they began a week ago and that they
would be ranking individuals in this
phase according to potential for academic success, leadership, and athletic
ability.

The next four slides dealt with mate
preferences. The first of these slides was
instructional, again asking students to
select the individual they would prefer
as their mate in a long-term husbandwife relationship. The three following
slides, slides A2—C2, displayed the same
photographs respectively as slides A1—
C1, although new positions for each of
the photographs on each slide were randomly assigned.

The next three slides involved ranking. The first was similar to those used a
week earlier, although it asked that the
ranking be based on perceived potential
for academic success. Two photographs
from each of the last three slides of the
first set, slides J1~L1, were randomly selected for use in producing the next two
slides, slides D2 and E2. These slides
were produced using the same criteria
used to produce slides D1 and E1.

Another three slides dealing with
ranking followed. The first was similar
to the preceding instructional slide, although it asked that the ranking be
based on perceived potential for leadership. The following two slides, slides F2
and G2, were produced from the same
six photographs used on slides D2 and

E2. Slide F2 was produced from a new
randomly selected group of three, and
G2 was produced using the remaining
three.

Three more slides involving ranking
followed. Again the first was similar to
others, though it asked that the ranking
be based on perceived athletic ability.
The two following slides, slides H2 and
12, were produced from the six photographs used on slides D2 and E2. Slide
H2 was produced from a new randomly
selected group of three, and I2 was produced using the remaining three.

The last four slides once again dealt
with mate preferences. The first of these
provided the same information concerning mate selection as the instructional
slide shown prior to slides A2—C2. The
next three slides, slides J2—L2, displayed the same photographs respectively as each of the last three slides in
the first sets (slides JI-L1), though new
positions for the photographs were randomly assigned.

In general, the slide sets were designed to expose students to groups of
photographs to determine their mate
preferences, both before and after being
familiarized with some of the photographs. With the photographs on the A—
C group of slides, the ranking or familiarization phase occurred one week
before the second and last mate selection phase involving these photographs.
This was not the case with the photographs on the J—L slides; the familiarization with photographs on these slides occurred just prior to the second mate
selection phase.

It was expected that some students
would choose different individuals as a
preferred mate the second time than
they chose the first time, and that the familiarization process might be in part re

sponsible. Changes in mate preferences
on slides A2—C2 would reflect switches
made one week after familiarization,
whereas changes made on slides J2—L2
would reflect switches made immediately after familiarization.

The indicated preference of each student on each mate preference slide seen
prior to familiarization (on slides AlC1 and Ji-L1) was compared with the
selection after being familiarized. Data
was then compiled to indicate the number and types of switches occurring with
respect to each of the individuals displayed on the mate preference slides.
Data was also compiled to indicate the
proportion of times a switch occurred
when the original selection was a familiar type photograph (a photograph used
on ranking slides) and the proportion of
times it occurred when the original selection was a nonfamiliar type photograph (a photograph not used on ranking slides). Tests of significance between
these two sample proportions were then
done using the formula given in Fundamental Statistical Concepts by F.E.
Fischer (1973, p. 261).

Based on the observed rate of selecting each of the four photographs on
each of the mate preference slides seen
prior to familiarization (on slides A1C1 and J1-L1) and the total rate of
switching from a particular photograph
to another on each of the mate preference slides seen after familiarization (on
slides A2-—C2 and J2-L2), expected
numbers of switches to a familiar type
and to a nonfamiliar type photograph
were calculated for each and for all photographs on each mate preference slide,
and for all photographs in the A—C and
J—L groups of slides. To determine
whether familiarization significantly influenced. the selections on the post

familiarization mate preference slide,
two by two tests of independence between the observed and expected numbers of switches to familiar type and
nonfamiliar type photographs were then
done using the adjusted chi-square formula given in Principles and Procedures
of Statistics by Steele and Torre (1960, p.
371).

students is given in Table 2.

As indicated earlier, photographs

dent for photographs in the J—-L slide
group. From 260 nonfamiliar selections
by male students on these slides, 137
switches (52.7 per cent) occurred. This
number is Significantly greater
(P < 0.01) than the 95 switches (39.9 per
cent) which occurred from 238 familiar
selections. Similarly, there was a significantly greater rate (P<0.01) of
switching from the nonfamiliar photographs selected prior to familiarization
from the J—L slides shown to the females. From 269 nonfamiliar selections,
135 switches (50.2 per cent) occurred,
whereas 117 switches (39.3 per cent) occurred from 298 familiar type selections.

The tendency for switching to occur
more frequently when the prefamiliarization selections were nonfamiliar photographs was also evident in the A-C
slides viewed by males. The 114 (45.2
per cent) switches which occurred from
the 252 nonfamiliar selections were
significantly greater (P < 0.01) than the
79 switches (32.1 per cent) from the 246

familiar selections. This increased rate
of switching from the nonfamiliar selections did not occur, however, in the A—
C slides seen by the female students.
From 311 nonfamiliar selections on the
prefamiliarization slides, 120 (38.9 per
cent) switches occurred. This number is
actually somewhat less frequent than occurred with the familiar selections,
where 100 (39.1 per cent) switches took
place from 256 selections.

The number of times students
switched their selection from one photograph to another on each of the mate
preference slides, the numbers of times
the switches were to familiar and nonfamiliar photographs, and the numbers
of times switches to familiar and nonfamiliar photographs were expected,
are given in Table 4 (for male students)
and Table 5 (for female students).

These tables show there is a strong
tendency to switch to familiar photographs rather than to nonfamiliar photographs, but only when familiarization

mate preference slides shown immediately after familiarization (those in the
J-L group), a significant excess
(P < 0.05) of switching occurred to familiar rather than to nonfamiliar photographs. Table 5 shows that 164 females
switched to familiar photographs and 88
switched to nonfamiliar photographs
versus the 134.9 and 117.1 expected, respectively. Again, switching to familiar
photographs occurred more frequently
than expected for all but one of the
twelve photographs in this group.

The tendency to switch to familiar
photographs was not evident on the
slides where the familiarization preceded the final mate selection sequence
by a week (see Figure 3). In fact, for
these slides (the A-C slides), more
switches than expected (though not
significantly more) occurred to nonfamiliar rather than to familiar photographs.
Ninety-three switches to familiar and
100 switches to nonfamiliar photographs
occurred on the A-C slides viewed by
the males, compared to expected values
of 97.7 and 95.3. Switching to the familiar photographs occurred more frequently than expected for only five of
the twelve photographs in this group.

More switches to the nonfamiliar
photographs also occurred (though
again not significantly more) with the
A-C slides seen by females. On these
slides 133 switches to nonfamiliar and 87
to familiar photographs occurred as
compared to 117.3 and 102.7 expected.
Switching to a familiar photograph occurred more frequently than expected
for only three of the twelve photographs.

DISCUSSION

Psychologists, sociologists, and biologists have long been aware of the im
Human Mating Preferences

 

263

portance of the first years of life in establishing various types of behavior. The
importance of these first years has also
been stressed in a number of proposals
or hypotheses concerned with behavior
involving mate choice. In some cases
early development is stressed so emphatically that one is left with the impression that experiences occurring
later in life are of little or no importance.
The word “imprinting” used in discussions of Westermarck’s incest avoidance
studies in other animals (Gallagher,
1977; Sonnemann and Sjolander, 1977),
also seems to suggest that mating
choices are fixed very early in life, with
little or no possibility of change.

The frequent change of preferences
observed in this study and the diminishment of the rearing effect observed by
Cato and Mug (1984), however, suggest
that the basis for mating behavior is not
irreversibly fixed early in life and that
later experiences may be more critical
than has previously been acknowledged. Perhaps, while the basis for mate
choice may be established early in life,
this basis is subject to considerable modification by later experiences, particularly in those species having a great capacity to learn.

Later experiences apparently did influence the mating preferences of both
males and females in this study. The rate
of switching and selecting the familiar
type by the females was almost as great
as by the males. One might have expected a greater disparity between the
two sexes, since the photographs used in
the evaluation of preferred mates reflect
physical differences, and since as Mullan (1984) indicates, males tend to evaluate potential mates from a much more
physical point of view than do females.
Physical differences, however, also
serve as a means of assessing underlying

character differences (Duck and Miell,
1983). Perhaps a considerable amount
of character evaluation occurred during
the evaluation of the photographs in this
study.

The extent of switching and selecting
a familiar rather than a nonfamiliar photograph was somewhat surprising.
Among the groups of photographs
shown to females immediately after familiarization, familiar photographs
were selected 22 per cent more frequently than would be expected if the familiarization had had no effect. The
comparable figure among the males was
33 per cent (see Figure 3). Considering
these figures, it is also a bit surprising
that no increase occurred when familiarization preceded final mate preference
selection by a week. These findings
seem to indicate that while preferences
can easily change, the factors contributing to the rationale responsible for the
change are easily forgotten.

There is no doubt that factors influencing mate choice are critical to evolutionary survival. It is reasonable that
late familiarization is a means by which
an individual can better evaluate potential mates. As an individual becomes
better known, doubts about that individual’s ability to contribute to the relationship and to the survival of potential
offspring would diminish. Survival of
the genetic line, it seems reasonable to
suggest, is too critical to entrust to an
unknown or little-known potential
mate.

The findings of this study can be reconciled with the ideas inherent in the
“inbreeding avoidance” hypothesis. It is
reasonable that if it is important to avoid

Human Mating Preferences

265

mating with close relatives, the time to
develop mating aversions would be
when contacts with relatives exceed contracts with acceptable or desirable potential mates. This would be the period
of infancy and early childhood. Since
the interval of time between the establishment of such aversive behavior and
actual mating is so long, such behavior
would be expected to be somewhat permanently ingrained. It also seems reasonable that the time to develop strong
preferences is when encounters with relatives are less likely and encounters with
desirable mates are more likely to occur.
This would be the time of adolescence
or of life as a young adult. Since mating
can occur soon after such encounters,
there is no need for these preferences to
be continuously maintained.

Thus, a system based on long-term
avoidance behavior which is established
early in life and on short-term preferences arising much later in life seems
quite feasible. It would certainly be appropriate in a species like man where
family contacts are maintained to some
extent throughout much of life, where a
tremendous capacity to learn exists, and

where there is considerable mobility

among those who are sexually mature.
Such a system would not only tend to
avoid the undesirable effects of inbreeding, but would promote outbreeding
and would thereby increase genetic variability within the population.
