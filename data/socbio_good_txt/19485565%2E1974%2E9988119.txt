Marital Distances and Inbreeding in

Porto Alegre, Brazil

Porto Alegre, Brazil

Inbreeding coefficients have been calculated for a large number of populations
(reviews in Freire-Maia, 1957, 1968;
Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971). Another measure of population structure is
the distance which separates the spouses’
birthplaces (marital distance). Much less
is known about its distribution in different
human groups (see, for instance, Morton,
1964; Krieger, 1966; Azevedo et al., 1969;
Yasuda, 1969; Coimbra et al., 1971, for
researches in Brazilian populations; Imaizumi and Furusho, 1972, and Lasker et
al., 1972, for studies in Japan and Italy,
respectively).

The relationship between these two
parameters, as well as between them and
other estimates of population migration, is
not well established. Bresler (1970) observed a curious effect of greater fetal loss
as the distances between birthplaces of
mates increased. On the other hand,
Wolanski et al. (1969, 1970) found a
positive correlation between the stature,
chest circumference, and Quetelet’s index
of 1,896 Polish children with the increasing
distances in the places of birth of their
parents.

Our paper furnishes data on marital dis
tances and inbreeding coefficients from
samples of the White and Black populations of Porto Alegre, Brazil; the relation
between these variables was studied and
the effect of marital distances on prenatal
mortality and newborn morbidity investigated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The present work was done as part of a
general long-term plan of study of the
population of Porto Alegre, Brazil. The
collection of information was made at
two maternity hospitals. The data from
Hospital Presidente Vargas was collected
from January, 1965, to October, 1969;
and data from Hospital Ernesto Dornelles,
from March, 1968, to June, 1970. Each
hospital was visited at least three times
a week. Information about the newborn
was collected from the maternity records,
supplemented when necessary by personal
examination and discussions with the physician in charge.

Afterwards, an interview with the
mother was arranged, to obtain some additional data about herself and her husband.
These included their past reproductive performance, their places of birth and those of

249

250

their parents, plus their biological relationship.

The estimation of marital distances was
made using appropriate maps. When the
members of a couple were born in Brazil,
the computation used the mileage between
the two points by way of the most common
roads. For computation involving locations
in a foreign country, a straight-line distance was used. The calculation of the inbreeding coefficient was made after a
careful questioning of the mother; when
she was biologically related to her husband,
a simplified pedigree was drawn to ascertain in a precise way their degree of relatedness.

All data were coded, transferred to
punched cards, and analyzed in the university’s 1130 IBM electronic computer.

RESULTS

Table 1 and Figure 1 present the distribution of marital distances of coupies
from this and the past generation, subdivided according to race. All the distributions showed a marked leptokurtosis,
similar to that observed in other series.
As can be seen, in the present generation
irrespective of race the marital distances
of 26 per cent of the couples were equal
to or Jess than 10 km. The frequency of
this class increases from two to three times
when we consider the wife’s or husband’s
parents. Despite the general similarity between the distributions of Whites and
Blacks, they are significantly different in
the two generations considered; the dissimilarity is mainly due to long-range
migration. Differences also appear when
we compare within each race the data from
the wife’s and husband’s parents.

The average and median marital distances observed in Porto Alegre are compared in Table 2 with the averages found
in another Brazilian city, Belém, the capital of the state of Parad. Considering Bra

zilians only, the Porto Alegre averages of
Whites and Blacks do not differ markedly,
nor do the medians in general, which are
not affected by the relatively small number of marriages involving foreigners; the
latter, as indicated above, are in the main
responsible for the observed ethnic differences. The medians of the marriages
contracted in the past generation are extremely low in Porto Alegre. The Belém
averages without foreigners are of the same
order of magnitude as those observed in
Porto Alegre; but since European immigrants to Brazil settled mainly in the south
during the last century, the Porto Alegre

marital distances show higher values when
foreigners are considered.

Table 3 shows the data on the relationship between marital distances and prenatal mortality. Blacks and Whites do not
differ markedly. There exists some variation in the Black sample mainly due to the
201-300, 501-997, and 998-and-more in
tervals; but in general no significant trend
appears with an increase in the distances.
The same is true for the prevalence of
malformed infants (Table 4).

As is seen in Table 5, Blacks and Whites
show no differences in inbreeding rates,
and the values observed are practically
equal to the one calculated by Freire-Maia

the same order of magnitude as those observed in the total sample (Table 3). The
malformed newborns showed an average
inbreeding coefficient (0.00096) practically
equal to that of the normal ones (0.00092).

Table 6 presents the variation of the
average coefficient of inbreeding with increasing marital distance; as can be seen,
the F value is relatively high for couples
with distances up to 100 km., a sharp de

crease occurring thereafter. This relationship is shown in Figure 2. The calculated
regression coefficient is significantly different from zero, indicating that in the
interval observed there is a negative relationship between inbreeding and marital
distance.

DISCUSSION

The problem of evaluating marital distances, if by means of a straight line or
by the use of the most common roads, has
been discussed in other reports. To Morton
et al. (1968) the choice of the shortest
roads is “arbitrary and inaccurate,” while
Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer (1971) state
that the use of distances “as the crow flies
are easier to compute, but are perhaps
more suitable for crows than for human
genetics.” We believe that for short distances it is important to consider actual
roads; but for larger distances, which many
times are traveled by air, the straight line
can give a sufficiently good approximation

of the true migration. This mixed approach
was followed in our analysis.

The average marital distances reported
for Porto Alegre are relatively large especially when we consider all marriages (involving Brazilians and foreigners). Lower
values were observed in Switzerland (Morton et al., 1968), three Japanese communities (Imaizumi and Furusho, 1972) and
two Alpine Italian populations (Lasker et

al., 1972). As for comparisons within Brazil, the Porto Alegre and Belém data agree
reasonably well, showing much more migration than that encountered by Krieger
(1966) in the northeast (averages of 86.9
and 53.2 km. for the present and past generation respectively).

The differences which we observed in
the results from the wife’s and husband’s
parents may be due to our method of obtaining this information. Since the latter
was collected through the wife, there is a
possibility that she would know more
easily the distances of her husband’s
parents when they were short than when
they were long.

Our findings do not support those of
Bresler (1970); the incidence of prenatal
mortality was not greater at larger marital
distances, neither could we detect any effect in the prevalence of malformed infants.
Ethnic differences, with the exception of
the distance distribution, were also negligible in our material.

The low inbreeding rates observed in
Porto Alegre are similar to those found

SUMMARY

A total of 4,491 White and 951 Black
couples ascertained at the birth of one of
their children was studied in relation to

wmarital distances and inbreeding. EstiS mates of the first parameter are relatively
Slarge and differ among the indicated ethnic
" groups mainly because of long-range miS gration. No effect of marital distance on
Aprenatal mortality and newborn morbidity

S was observed. The inbreeding rates are low
