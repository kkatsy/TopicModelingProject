ABSTRACT: For the present study three castes representing three socioeconomic levels have been
selected from Andhra Pradesh, South India. Members of the wealthier castes married consanguineously more frequently than did the members of the lower-ranking castes. The consanguineous unions among all the castes are found to be more fertile than are nonconsanguineous unions. Indeed, fertility increases with degree of relationship of the spouses. Number of
pregnancies and live births are significantly (P = 0.01) higher among consanguineous unions
(among all the castes). However, the difference in the number of surviving offspring between
consanguineous and nonconsanguineous unions is not significant among the wealthier castes.
This suggests that child mortality is higher among the offspring of consanguineous unions in

spite of their greater wealth.

Studies of the effects of consanguineous marriage or inbreeding on fertility have produced variable findings.
Some studies have revealed higher birth
rates among the consanguineous couples as compared to nonconsanguineous
couples (Schull et al., 1970; Reid, 1971:
Mukherjee et al., 1974), while others
have found lower fertility among the inbred as compared to non-inbred (Bermiss, 1858; Post, 1965). Still others have
not found any effect of consanguinity on
fertility (Arner, 1908; Slatis et al.,
1958).

In the present paper I expand on this
data base through an analysis of marriage, fertility, and child survivorship
among three caste groups in southern
India. South India provides a fertile field
for studies of this nature since consanguineous marriages are an essential part
of its social structure. The coefficient of
inbreeding is found to be unusually high
in Andhra Pradesh, a South India state,
for which reason the area is selected for

this study. es

MATERIALS AND METHODS

With the objective of assessing the interrelations between consanguineous
marriage and fertility, I selected three
caste groups for field study in Nellore
District,! Andhra Pradesh, South India.
One group is a well-to-do agricultural
caste, the Desuri Kapu; the second, an
artisan caste in the middle range of hierarchy, the Devanga; the third is a scheduled caste? which is at the bottom of the
social ladder, the Mala. Fairly high levels of inbreeding are found among all
the three castes in this region (Nellore
District).

There are no previous studies on this
topic for the Desuri Kapu and the
Devanga. There are a few studies on the

INellore district lies between 13° 30’ and 16°
northern latitude and 79° 51’ and 80° 15’ eastern
longitude. A district is a subdivision of a state, constituting its most important unit of administration
and having at its head an officer called a Collector.
Many taluks are grouped into a district. It corresponds to the Zillah of earlier times.

Mala of some other districts in Andhra
Pradesh, which dealt only with the frequency distributions of consanguineous
marriages.

These three castes have been selected
because they are at different socioeconomic levels which in turn might have a
differential impact on the frequency of
consanguineous marriages and on child
survivorship. Adopting purposive sampling, data have been collected from
three revenue villages? so as to further
control for any effects of socioeconomic
factors. The villages covered have been
selected from two taluks,’ namely, Nellore and Sullurpet. Nellore Taluk is well
served by an irrigational system from
the Pennar River and has better economic resources, whereas, Sullurpet Taluk lacks irrigational facilities and ts relatively backward economically.

The two taluks have been extensively
surveyed to determine the distribution
of the aforementioned castes in different villages. On the basis of such a survey, it has been found that there are only
three revenue villages where all the
three castes are represented. There are
two such villages in Sullurpet Taluk,
Mambattu? and Andagundala® and one
in Nellore Taluk, i.e., Kodur.’ But with

3A revenue village is the smallest revenue unit
in the administration. It may or may not be coterminus with a panchayat village (union) which is the
smallest political unit of the government. A village
accountant (Karnam) is in charge of agricultural
tax (revenue) collection.

‘A taluk is an administrative subdivision of an
Indian revenue district, having at its head an officer called a Tahsildar. Many revenue villages are
grouped into a taluk.

SMambattu revenue village lies between 13°39’
50” northern latitude and 79° 58’ 21” eastern longitude.

6Andagundala revenue village lies between 13°
37’ 20” northern latitude and 80° 0’ 21” eastern longitude.

"Kodur revenue village lies between 14°28’ 21”
northern latitude and 80° 8' 6” eastern longitude.

regard to Kodur, one fact has to be mentioned. Some of the families belonging
to the Devanga caste have recently emigrated from Kodur to a nearby hamlet
called Narayana Reddy Peta for economic reasons. Hence, Kodur and Narayana Reddy Peta are considered as a
single unit (Kodur) as far as the
Devanga are concerned, while the data
for the Kapu and the Mala in Nellore
Taluk have been collected from Kodur
alone.

Prominent elders of these villages
were approached with the help of village
servants and panchayat presidents, particularly those of the three castes. After
rapport was established, genealogical
information was gathered through intensive interviewing of both men and
women. Cross-checks were made to verify the data. A repetition of inquiry
among a few households after a lapse of
six months ensured the reliability of the
previous data. Field work lasted twenty
months from April 1978 until the end of
1979. Information was collected on demographic aspects, past reproductive
history, including the outcome of each
pregnancy, and on the consanguinity of
couples. Wherever consanguineous
marriages were reported, the degree
and kind of relationship was noted. The
data is entirely based on genealogical information provided by the informants.

higher frequency of consanguineous
marriages (47.20 per cent) than the NelJore Taluk (44.31 per cent) which is represented by Kodur village in this study.
The same trend is observed even in the
case of individual castes in their relative
distribution of marriages in the two taJuks.

If we consider the frequency of related marriages without resorting to regional variation, the Devanga rank
highest with 48.26 per cent followed by
the Desuri Kapu (47.46 per cent) and
the Mala (40.63 per cent). Higher castes
like the Desuri, Kapu, and the Devanga
have higher frequencies of consanguineous marriages than the untouchable
lower caste, the Mala, because highercaste people are more prone to marry
among relatives so that they can avoid
splitting their moveable and immoveable properties through dowry or bride
price. That is also one of the reasons for
having more extended families among
the Desurt Kapu (36.82 per cent) and
the Devanga (22.62 per cent) than
among the Mala (19.29 per cent). The
extended family is found to be most
prevalent among the Desuri Kapu
which is the politically, economically,
and socially dominant agricultural caste
among the three (Reddy, 1981).

Out of the total marriages (2,524),
18.98 per cent are between uncle (MB)
and nieces (ZD), 21.79 per cent are between first cousins (FC), and 4.99 per
cent are among cousins beyond first
cousins (BFC). Uncle-niece marriages
are found to be slightly higher in Nellore
Taluk (19.33 per cent) than in Sullerpet
Taluk (18.63 per cent) whereas cousin
marriages are more frequent in Sullerpet Taluk (FC =23.52 per cent;
BFC = 5.05 per cent) than in Nellore
Taluk (FC=20.05 per _ cent;
BFC = 4.93 per cent). The Desuri Kapu

Consanguineous Marriages 71

caste exhibits a higher proportion of
uncle-niece marriages (22.46 per cent)
than the Devanga (17.78 per cent) and
the Mala (16.01 per cent), while in the
latter two castes first-cousin marriage
(D = 24.59 per cent; M = 21.61 per
cent) predominate. This is true in both
regions.

First-cousin marriages occur more
frequently than uncle-niece and distantcousin (beyond first cousin) marriages in
the sample population. This trend is not
altered even across regions and castes
except in respect to the Desuri Kapu,
where there is a higher prevalence of
uncle-niece marriages than other types.
Members of Desuri Kapu, being a landowning community, try to live in extended families irrespective of the sex of
their siblings, thus leading to 48.07 per
cent of their extended families being
brother-sister-centered extended families (Reddy, 1981). In this type of family, the maternal uncle waits for his sister’s daughter to come of age and
marries her to keep the family’s assets
together over generations. Where sister’s daughter (ZD) marriage is practiced over generations, sister’s daughter
will be the same as mother’s brother’s
daughter (MBD), i.e., ZD = MBD. In
such cases of ambiguity, the relationship
of ego to his nearest blood relative (sister’s daughter) is considered, and the
spouse is treated as ZD although in relationship she is also his MBD. I have
treated such types as ZD (uncle-niece)
marriages in this study.

EFFECTS OF INBREEDING ON FERTILITY

Studies in the United States (Eaton
and Mayer, 1954; Pearson, 1902; Fisher,
1949), in Europe (Darwin, 1875;
Darlington, 1960; Book, 1956), in South
America (Freire-Maia and Azevedo,

1971), in Japan (Schull et al., 1970;
Schull and Neel, 1972; Yamamoto et
al., 1972; Schull, 1973), in India (Reid,
1973; Mukherjee et al., 1974; Basu,
1975; Ramesh, 1979), and in FrenchCanadian (Philippe, 1974) populations
have revealed higher fertility rates
among consanguineously related married couples than among nonconsanguineous couples.

Lower fertility rates among nonconsanguineous couples have been noted in
an Italian population (Contario, 1969),
in an urban population of southern Brazil (Marcallo et al., 1964), and in a Goyigama caste population in rural Sri
Lanka (Reid, 1976). A few studies in
the United States (Arner, 1908; Slatis et
al., 1958), in Europe (Sutter and Tabah,
1952), in Kurdistan Jews (Goldschmidt
et al., 1963), in India (Rao and Inbaraj,
1977), and in Jordon (Cook and
Hanslip, 1966) have shown that there is
no difference in fertility levels among
consanguineous and nonconsangulneous couples.

In the present study, the inbreeding
effects on fertility are assessed on the
basis of a comparison of the number of
pregnancies, number of live births, and
surviving offspring to at least age of 21
years between consanguineous and nonconsanguineous couples. A total of
2,524 married women has been considered for this purpose.

The mean number of pregnancies is
observed to be more than four in consanguineous couples (DK = 4.57;
D = 5.20; M = 4.79), while it is observed to be below four in nonconsanguineous couples (DK =3.14;
D = 3.65; M =3.47) among all the
castes under study. Similar values have
been observed in the mean number of
live births also (DK = 4.24; D = 4.69;
M = 4.40, and DK =3.11; D =3.50;

Social Biology

M = 3.37 in consanguineous and nonconsanguineous couples respectively).
Not much difference has been observed
between consanguineous and nonconsanguineous couples in the mean number of surviving offspring among the Desuri Kapu (C = 2.83; NC = 2.83) and
the Devanga (C=3.06; NC = 2.92),
while this difference is greater in the
Mala (C = 3.14; NC = 2.85).

In the pooled sample of all the three
groups, the mean number of pregnancies, live births, and surviving offspring
among consanguineous couples is 4.85,
4.44, and 2.99 respectively, as against
3.41, 3.32, and 2.87 among nonconsanguineous couples. In general, the results
indicate that consanguineous couples
are more fertile, having more pregnancies, live births, and surviving offspring
than nonconsanguineous couples. The
inbreeding effects are statistically significant on all the fertility parameters
studied in the pooled sample. In the individual castes, significant effects are
observed only on number of pregnancies and live births. Significant inbreeding effect is found to be absent in respect
to mean number of surviving offspring
among the Desuri Kapu and the
Devanga while it is present among the
Mala (Table 2). This differential effect
ofinbreeding on surviving offspring may
be attributed to the differential history
of inbreeding among the three castes.

Similar uniform inbreeding effects on
fertility variables are noticed in both the
regional subsamples (of Nellore Taluk
and Sullurpet Taluk) of all the three endogamous caste groups investigated.
However, in the regional comparison,
significant inbreeding effect on surviving offspring is observed only among the
Mala of Nellore Taluk (Tables 3 and 4).
This deviation of the Mala in general
and the Nellore Taluk Mala in particular

ence in “‘net fertility” (defined as the total live births minus nonaccidental
deaths prior to the age of 21, or surviving offspring in the present study). The
present study also supports this view to a
great extent.

Table 5 shows the inbreeding effects
on fertility parameters by degree of consanguinity. Among the total population
under study, although there is no
definite linear trend, the mean number
of pregnancies and live births have been
found to be higher among the uncleniece marriages (pregnancies = 5.26;
live births = 4.23) as compared with
other kinds of kin marriages (pregnancies, FC = 4.62, BFC = 4.32; live births,
FC = 4.06, BFC = 4.08). In contrast,
the number of surviving offspring ts
more or less similar among uncle-niece
(2.99) and first-cousin (2.95) marriages
but lower than that observed among the
marriages beyond first cousin (3.26).
Caste-wise analysis yields results which
are in agreement with the findings in the
total population.

INBREEDING EFFECTS: TEMPORAL TRENDS
IN FERTILITY

The results on temporal trends of inbreeding effects on various fertility parameters are given in Table 6. It can be
seen from the table that the trends of the
results are not similar for all the three
parameters of fertility. Further, the
magnitude of difference between conSsanguineous and nonconsanguineous
couples varies with the age of the
mother. The differences are generally
higher among those of older groups (51
years and above) compared with the
middle (26-50 years) and younger age
groups (up to 25 years). This finding
possibly could be due to the sampling
variations and to incomplete reproductive histories of the women in younger
age groups.

Temporal trends are reflected less in
the mean number of surviving offspring
and live births than in the mean number
of pregnancies. There is no qualitative
variation among the caste groups.

CONCLUSION

The present study finds positive relationships between wealth and/or social
level, the frequency of consanguineous
marriages, and fertility. Among the
three South Indian caste groups, members of the wealthier castes married consanguineously more frequently than did
members of the lower-ranking castes.
Within each caste, wealthier individuals
were more likely to marry relatives than
were the less wealthy. Moreover, the
consanguineous unions as a group were
significantly more fertile than were nonconsanguineous unions. The association
of greater wealth or social rank with
greater fertility could be construed to
result from the presumed better health
and material means of the higherranking groups. Paradoxically, however, while the wealthier groups are
more fertile than the lower ranking
groups, the difference in the number of

surviving offspring between consanguineous and nonconsanguineous unions is not significant. This suggests that
child mortality is higher among offspring of consanguineous unions in spite
of their greater wealth. This finding
could indicate that any deleterious consequences of inbreeding are being experienced postpartum rather than in conception and carrying to term. It is hoped
that further research in the area will
clear up this interesting paradox.
