Response to Fleshman’s Comment on

‘Sudden Infant Death Syndrome

as a Socially Determined Cause of Death’’

We appreciate the interest Catherine
Fleshman has shown in our paper, and
we look forward to the results of the
studies using personal histories and
autopsies in investigating determinants
of SIDS mortality.

Our reading of the vast literature on
SIDS as a reported cause of infant
deaths indicated a substantial emphasis
on medical and biological explanations.
Our positing of the two alternative
models was designed to give increased
attention to the social and cultural aspects. In fact, we referred to the latter as
possible ‘‘contributing conditions” (p.
1). Our view of the complexity of the relationships of the medical, biological,
social, and cultural factors is reflected in
the title of our forthcoming article in Demography (“Infant Mortality by Cause
of Death: Main and Interaction Effects’) in which SIDS is included as a
cause of infant deaths and potential explanatory variables are examined in
combinations.

As an interdisciplinary team from the
social sciences and medicine, we are

and Larry C. Deeb

well aware of the strengths and weaknesses of alternative methodologies.
Fleshman is correct that SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and our conclusion
that the reporting of the cause varies according to social and demographic characteristics of the infant suggests either
that this association is causal or that
there is a failure to investigate fully for
certain classes. This is the point of the
concluding discussion in the paper.

The use of personal histories and
autopsies can extend the range of critical
variables to be analyzed, and that is desirable, but it is not reasonable to assume that personal histories and autopsies can be obtained for any large
proportion of infant deaths (even for
SIDS alone) in the future. We must,
therefore, continue to use available
sources of information, including death
certificates and surveys, and try to educate those responsible for acquiring information on those documents to provide as much accurate information as
possible.
