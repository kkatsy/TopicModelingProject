Memorandum to Members of the

Society for the Study of Social Biology

Arthur Falek, Editor

As you know, Richard Osborne is retiring as Editor of Social Biology after a
number of years and I have been designated to replace him. You can well understand Dick’s act is a very hard one to
follow.

Since January of this year, I have been
reviewing all manuscripts received for
consideration for publication. I am pleased
to say that there are good ones. However,
there are many which do not fit within the
areas of interest of the journal. In addition, there has been a decrease in the total
volume of papers received as compared to
previous years. We should like to invite

members of the Society to submit articles

for publication to Social Biology. Some
members of the Society have informed me
that they have been holding back from
publishing articles in Social Biology because they believed that it would take so
long to get papers into print. I have not
reviewed that aspect of the situation, but
should like to assure you that for the fu
 

ture we shall make every effort to see to it
that papers sent to us will be acted upon as
rapidly as possible. We are attempting to
streamline our reviewing procedures in
order to do so.

In the past few months we have received very few papers in the area of genetics. We should therefore like to encourage those members of the Society working
in this field to submit manuscripts relevant
to the interests of Social Biology. At the
same time, let me also encourage those of
you in other fields to submit relevant papers to Social Biology. We need good
manuscripts. As members of the Society,
Social Biology is our journal—yours and
mine, and I do not want and I know you
do not want to let the level of the Journal
diminish because of a decrease in the
number of papers submitted. While I
know that additional manuscripts will increase the work of the Associate Editors
and myself, the results will be worth the
effort.
