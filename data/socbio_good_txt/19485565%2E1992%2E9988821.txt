ABSTRACT: This paper examines the ecological determinants of contemporary Japanese divorce
rates on the prefectural level. LISREL and computer-generated graphics are the analytic
methods used. The aggregate level of analysis demands the use of the ecological model which
posits that demographic changes, economic activities, migration patterns, and the level of
urbanization are significant predictors of divorce rate. Our analysis demonstrates that sex ratio,
female labor force participation, female in-migration patterns, population increase, and net
household income all play a significant role in affecting the divorce rate. Our findings also
confirm the well-supported hypothesis that both population density and modernization positively
influence modern Japan’s divorce rates. The residual analysis also points out that in order to
account for the large proportion of the unexplained variance of Japanese divorce, behavioralrelated variables and island- or prefecture-specific dimensions need to be included in the

ecological model of divorce.

The present paper examines the
ecological model and its ability to determine the variation of the divorce
rate in contemporary Japan at the prefectural (regional) level. We investigate the conditions suggested by the
ecological model on the variations of
intra-national divorce rates (Glick,
1963).

Like other advanced nations, the industrialization of Japan, labeled since
the middle 1950’s as Japan’s ‘“‘economic miracle,” has been accompanied by a number of social problems
(Glickman, 1979; Shoji, 1988), including an increase in the divorce rate. Japan’s divorce rate has increased by
one-third in recent years (1975-88),
though Japan’s divorce rate is relatively low in comparison to other industrialized nations. During the late
1970’s, the divorce rate for Japan was a

low 1.22 per 1,000 population (1980) in
contrast to the United States’ 5.30 (in
1980), Russia’s 3.47 (in 1977), the
United Kingdom’s 3.47 (in 1977), and
Denmark’s 2.51 (in 1978) (Kumagai,
1983). While Japan’s divorce rate has
risen slightly to a 1986 level of 1.37, it
nevertheless remains low in comparison to other industrialized nations.

A problem in studying regional or
intra-national variations in divorce
rates in the United States and other industrialized nations is the question of
determining the extent to which such
rates are influenced by legal rather
than socioeconomic variables. That is,
the divorce rate in a geographic area
may be influenced by its regionalspecific legal system as well as its social
conditions. For example, in the United
States, regional and state variations in
divorce rate may be influenced by the

258

fact that some states or groups of states
have less stringent divorce laws than
others (Kalback, 1975; Pang and Hanson, 1968).

Japan, however, provides a uniquely advantageous setting for the
analysis of divorce. Prefectures, equivalent to state units in the United States
or provinces in Canada, enjoy social
and economic diversity, while the legal
system dealing with divorce in Japan is
nationally uniform (Fukurai and Alston, 1990). Although the legal system
in Japan is centralized and uniform,
prefectural units continue to maintain
a high degree of social and economic
heterogeneity. We can therefore eliminate the possibility that the different
legal systems and their enforcement
cause variability in inter-regional divorce rates.

Social Biology

The divorce rate in Japan has fluctuated throughout the twentieth century, experiencing a cycle of highs and
lows. The divorce rate is presently at
the same high level as found during the
early 1900’s and is double the rate
found during the early 1940’s when Japan experienced the lowest divorce
rates in its modern history. Figure 1 illustrates the cyclical change of Japan’s
divorce rate since 1900.

The Japanese experienced an increase in the divorce rate during Japan’s post-war stage of industrialization (Goode, 1971). This post-war
increase is assumed to be primarily due
to a decline in the importance of traditional values of the extended family,
an increase in married women’s participation in labor force, and women’s decreased role in the reproduction of la

bor (Kesler and McRae, 1982; Lee,
1982; Morioka, 1987). This reasoning,
however, does not explain Japan’s
more recent rising divorce rate, the relatively high divorce rate around the
1900’s (Kumagai, 1983), or the diversity in divorce rates from one prefecture to another.

The national divorce rate of Japan
obscures very large variations from one
region (prefecture) to another. While
contemporary Japanese society is rel
atively homogeneous as measured by

social class and income, educational,
racial and linguistic divisions, Figure 2
indicates that there are nevertheless
high regional variations in divorce
rates. As a result, little is understood
concerning the social dynamics underlying the present level of divorce in
Japan.

THE ECOLOGICAL APPROACH

Much of the research on the ecology
of American divorce has focused on
the impact of urbanization and economic development on marital stability. The ecological model has focused
on macro-level, structural variables
and is more amenable to national and
regional samples. This model also has
greater utility for comparative, crossnational levels of analysis. Trent and
South (1989), using a sample of 66
countries to analyze the correlates of
divorce, found that the ecological variables, including the demographic factors, migration patterns, and the level

of regional economic development,

were strongly associated with national
divorce rates. While the research
found that the relationship was curvilinear rather than linear, macro variables such as regional economic devel

259

opment and changing demographic
factors, including population distributions, were found to be important predictors of the divorce rate.

Other researchers have used aggregate data to examine how the changing
characteristics of organizational and labor market structures affect regional
economic activity and the divorce rate.
The overall employment opportunities
in the regional economy facilitate the
development of a highly segmented labor force that eventually absorbs the
female labor force (Cherlin, 1981; Huber and Spitze, 1980; South, 1985).
That is, while the increase in women’s
employment status is strongly correlated with high incidences of divorce,
the extent of female labor force participation (FLFP) is contingent upon the
degree of the regional development of
both organizational structures and labor market forces that subsequently
promote FLFP.

Reynolds et al. (1984), for instance,
show that the aggregate analysis is a
useful approach to explain variations in
divorce rates when various economic
activities in the region are taken into
consideration. Others, notably Glenn
and Shelton (1985) and Fenelon
(1971), suggest that larger units of
analysis Should be used, such as state
or region, because their research suggests that both regional demographic
changes and economic activities are
significant predictors of the divorce
rate. Their analyses suggest that aggregate information provides the highest
form of generalizability since it represents population parameters rather
than sample statistics. The following
discussion focuses on the ecological
variables and their impact on the divorce rate.

FEMALE LABOR ForRCE PARTICIPATION

Past research suggests that female
labor force participation (FLFP) in the
region is found to be a significant predictor of divorce. While it is possible
that the patterns of behavior at a group
level might not reflect corresponding
patterns on an individual level, the extent of female labor force participation
(FLFP) has been proven to be an important determinant of divorce.

The analysis of divorce rates and
their causes has increasingly focused
on the ecological variables reflecting
psychological and attitudinal variables,
such as feelings of social isolation
among women and distress and dissatisfaction among husbands, particularly
associated with their wives’ work outside the home (Arnott, 1972; Kessler
and McRae, 1982; Roos, 1983; Reimers, 1985). The extent of FLFP then
reflects the dimension of behavioral
patterns at the individual level.

The FLFP and marital dissatisfaction are positively related in that the
FLFP increased psychological distress
among spouses and led to the high
incidence of divorce. Kessler and
McRae (1982), for instance, examined
married women’s increased participation in the labor force and how their
higher employment status affected
psychological distress among their
spouses. The researchers found that,
while the increase in spouses’ earnings
did not influence men’s marital satisfaction, negative attitudes toward
spouses’ employment were closely related to the spouses’ failure to adjust to
changing gender-based behaviors,
leading to a subsequent increase in psychological distress among men. Key
variables in this model are the entry of

Japanese Divorce

261

women into nonfarming occupations
and their occupational status in the labor market.

Reimers (1985) examined the relationship of labor force participation
among married women from six different ethnic groups and their marital stability. The study pointed out that indicators of cultural differences such as
language, family size, age, and educational differences, explained the large
variation in the economic status of
married women. For instance, in examining the changing roles of Hispanic
women in the United States, the influence of Hispanic culture as measured
by such variables as the maintenance of
large extended family ties, educational
attainment, the use of the Hispanic
language, and ties to ethnic communities were found to be the major predictors of both economic status among
Hispanic women and levels of marital
stability.

Arnott (1972) and Perlin and
Johnson (1977) examined the relation
between husbands’ attitude and adjustment to wives’ employment and how
the changing sex role behavior affected
marital status. Their research indicated
that cultural factors such as parental
roles and responsibilities, and psychological factors, such as feeling of social
isolation among married women, are
closely related to the degree of psychological distress among men.

Thus, past research on marital stability and the factors leading to divorce
suggests that marital instability depends substantially on the degree of female labor force participation. At the
ecological level of analysis, we would
expect that women in areas with high
levels of FLFP will have greater opportunities for their economic indepenDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

dence that subsequently lead to higher
incidences of divorce.

SEX RATIO

The accessibility and availability of
both eligible men and women plays an
important role in predicting the marital
stability in the region. The availability
of both sexes is represented by the sex
ratio.

Guttentag and Secord (1983, p. 23)
suggest that the individual whose gender is in short supply has a stronger
position and is less dependent on the
partner because of the larger number
of alternative relationships available to
his/her gender. Sex ratio places constraints on women’s behavior and on
the roles they can play, especially when
they are in short supply. In contrast,
when there is a surplus of women, the
proportion of unmarried women increases, and women begin to strive for
greater independence and involvement
in a variety of roles in the society.

As applied to the divorce rate, this
finding would suggest that in areas
with a low sex ratio, women will have
greater opportunities in the economic
sectors which will increase their inde
pendence and lead to higher divorce:

rates. As the proportion of women in
an area decreases, there would be a relative scarcity of available women and
this would lead to reduction in the divorce rate.

MIGRATION

A number of scholars (Glenn and
Shelton, 1985; Shelton, 1987; Trovato,
1986) have suggested that intranational migration is associated with
the divorce rate. Migration is linked to
the change in the development and increased complexity of regional organi
 

Social Biology

zational structures and labor market.
Thus, regional migration forces change
in divorce rates by: (1) unbalancing the
sex ratio in the region and changing
the gender composition of available labor in the work force and (2) creating
greater economic opportunities for
women.

Shelton (1987) examined the relationship between migration patterns
and divorce rates even when human
capital variables, such as cultural differences, religious affiliation (Roman
Catholicism), and socioeconomic variables are held constant. She concluded
that community size makes possible a
higher level of residential mobility
which in turn leads to lower levels of
social integration and hence higher
rates of divorce. Shelton’s measure of
mobility included the following three
migration patterns: in- and out-migration and intra-community residential
mobility. Those three migration variables explained a large proportion of
the total variance in the divorce rate.

Fukurai et al. (1989) examined regional income inequality, migration
patterns, and the gender-based labor
market in the U.S.-Mexico borders.
Using 1980 municipio-level Mexican
census data for six Mexican border
states (equivalent to U.S. counties),
they found that migration was strongly
linked to the regional development of
organizational structures and labor
market growth. Specific economic activities taking place in the region were
better able to absorb female rather
than male laborers and take advantage
of the gender-based labor market. The
research further suggested that the
disintegration of traditional maledominated ethnic values occurred as
females became increasingly finan

cially independent and the main source
of family income. Subsequently there
has been high unemployment and underemployment among male workers.
The main finding is that the regional
development of both organizational
Structure and labor markets were
closely tied to migration patterns and
greater economic opportunities for female laborers, which in turn influenced
the traditional marital authority pattern.

URBANIZATION

The ecological model of divorce
stresses the importance of traditional
sex roles and how industrialization promotes or allows the evasion of traditional roles by women and eventually
leads to increases in divorce rates. For
example, urbanization and its related
factors of modernization promote the
disintegration of traditional norms and
values stressing the importance of extended families (Goode, 1963; Trent
and South, 1989). Such factors as urbanization increase married women’s
participation in the labor force, change
the role of women in the family, and
subsequently increase psychological
distress among their spouses. Thus,
this model posits that divorce rates will
be higher in more urban areas and under conditions of urban living than in
rural areas and farming communities.
This model has gained empirical support (Glick, 1963).

SOCIOECONOMIC CONTEXT

It seems clear, then, that divorce is
not influenced merely by population
parameters or the extent of FLFP
in the region, but by personal traits of
the individuals who live there. It is the
product also of the social context. So
Japanese Divorce

263

cial context, however, will vary from
region to region. To demonstrate and
account for such variation, we need
to incorporate the social and economic conditions of the regions under
analysis.

The ecological model of divorce relies on regional income variations (in
our case, prefectural levels) to account
for different levels of economic activities. The income level in the region is
assumed to have a positive relation
with the divorce rate. That is, greater
economic activity leads to greater economic independence and employment
opportunities for women, which in turn
increase the likelihood of divorce. Another measurement of socioeconomic
activities in the region is the level of
overall educational attainment. It affects the divorce rate because it increases the human capital levels and
economic opportunity for women.

Following the suggestions of Trent
and South (1989) and Reynolds et al.
(1984), we analyze the intra-national
divorce rates in Japanese prefectures.
The present analysis examines the extent to which Japan’s current divorce
rate is influenced by various social and
demographic dimensions, including
population characteristics, labor market participations, regional economic
structures, and the level of interregional migration.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Japanese census data for 1985-86
are utilized to examine the structural
relationship between the divorce rate
among Japan’s forty-seven prefectures
and selected variables. Prefectures
form the basic administrative unit below the national government. Each

264

prefecture has officials elected by popular vote and is essentially self-governing. Prefectures are subautonomous
political and economic units and provide social services (welfare, health,
law enforcement, etc.) based on special local needs and demands. The Japanese prefecture is equivalent to a
combination of America’s state and regional socio-political units (United
States Government, 1983).

Prefecture limits were drawn during
the late nineteenth century to reflect
social and historical distinctiveness.
Even today, Japanese prefectures exhibit a wide variation of social customs
and values recognized and honored
by government officials. As such,
prefecture-level analysis reflects social
as well as political reality.

The divorce rate also reflects the social diversity of the prefectures (see
Figure 2). The current divorce rate per
1,000 population varies from a high of
2.13 in Okinawa, an island in southern
Japan with a population of 1.19 million
to a low of 0.87 for the Shimane prefecture, an area also located in southern Japan. The population densities of
Okinawa and Shimane, as a further example of the social diversity of Japan’s
prefectures, are 528 and 120 persons
per square kilometer, respectively.

VARIABLES

The Japanese divorce rate is measured by the number of divorces per
1,000 population during 1985. Five
measures of population and demographic parameters are included in the
model. Sex ratio indicates the number
of males to the number of females
in each prefecture. The female labor
force participation is measured by the
ratio of the number of employed fe
 

Fukurai and Alston

 

Social Biology

males to the total number of the economically active female population.
Population increase is represented by
the per cent increase in population for
a given prefecture between 1980 and
1985. Population density is based on
the number of persons per square kilometer. The proportion of population
between 15 and 54 years of age is also
included in the model. This age group
is associated with higher incidences of
divorce rates and is included in order to
control for variations in the age-related
profiles of Japan’s prefectures.
Urbanization is also included in the
model since higher divorce rates are
generally found in urban areas rather
than in rural areas (Goode, 1963). Urbanization is generally defined as the
ratio of population living in places of
2,500 population or more to total population (SPP, 1985), although other
investigators have utilized places of
15,000-or-more population as the criterion (Unikel, 1977). In Japan, however, high population concentration
results in small intra-prefectural variation, thereby rendering the conventional urban/rural index inadequate. In
addition, because of limited geographical and spatial resources, there is little
variation of rural/urban distinctions
based on population. Urbanization in
Japan is better measured by the prefecture’s proportion of nonfarm land

-in privately owned land areas. This is

a more appropriate measurement because the scarcity of land is more reflected in urban sectors than rural
sectors (Fukurai and Alston, 1990;
Glickman, 1979).

Migration is measured by two variables: the amount of in- and outfemale migrants at prefectural levels.
These two variables represent overall

 
Vol. 39, No. 3-4

1985 migration activities and are measured by the percentage of females
who migrated to or from other prefectures.

The total prefectural income as well
as the net real-monthly income per
working household (in 1,000 yen) represent two economic activities. Finally,
the per cent of the prefecture’s popu
lation aged 25-54 with college experisence represents the overall educational
‘attainment in the region. The descripStive statistics and relationships among
Sthe structural variables is shown in
ATable 1.
co 6Insum, the ecological model of Jap‘nanese divorce is represented by the folcilowing twelve structural variables: (1)
divorce rate, (2) population increase,

Sof population increase, population
density, urbanization, and the proportion of age groups between 15 and 54.
Female in- and out-migration patterns

at both origin and destination are also”

assumed to have a significant effect on
the divorce rate, since the influx of females and their migration patterns influences the divorce by unbalancing the
gender ratio and by changing the level
of social integration and the cohesiveness of traditional family ties and values in the region.

Japanese Divorce

265

Regional income activity is also assumed to have a positive relation with
the divorce rate. That is, the greater
the economic activity, the greater the
economic independence and employment opportunities to women which increase the likelihood of divorce. Educational attainment also influences the
divorce rate because it increases the
human capital levels and economic opportunity for women. Education also
impacts on the economic status of
women and has been found to increase
psychological distress among their
spouses, thereby increasing the divorce
rate. While psychological dimensions
of divorce are not dealt with, we attempt to integrate the interpretation of
their effects on divorce with other
themes in the article.

THE COVARIANCE STRUCTURE
ANALYSIS

In assessing the ecological model
of divorce, the measurement parameters are estimated using correlation
matrices and standard deviation of
twelve ecological variables as input to
LISREL-VI (Joreskog and Sorbom,
1985). This computer program provides maximum likelihood estimates
(ML) of model parameters that are
specified as ‘free.’ The estimation
process is an iterating procedure that
minimizes a function of the differences
between observed covariance patterns
and the expected covariances estimated by the model.

The likelihood ratio chi-square statistic and the likelihood-ratio indices,
Delta and Rho, are employed in comparing fits in order to control for sample size (Bentler and Bonett, 1980;
Fukurai, 1991). Two indices, delta and

the accuracy of the census information from Third
World countries (Lopez, 1982; Peach, 1984). The

Numerous studies have addressed
the accuracy of Japanese census data
both before and after World War IT
(Smith, 1943, Taeuber, 1958; Farris,
1985). The studies suggest that the Japanese census may exhibit the highest
accuracy and quality levels of those
done in developed nations. Comparable accuracy and quality of census data
were also reported in preindustrialized
Japan (Hanley and Yamamura, 1977).
Hanley and Yamamura (1977) attribute such distinctive accuracy of
the population survey to the highly
centralized role of the government and
smaller geographical regions. Compared with the U.S. census, sources of
errors in the decennial census of Japan
remain minimal in both human and
mechanical areas (Taeuber, 1958; U.S.
Department of Commerce, 1981).

RESULTS

The patterns of Japanese divorce
are examined in Table 2. The first three
columns contain measurement parameter estimates for the saturated
model that specifies correlated relations among eleven exogenous variables and eleven direct effects on the
divorce rate. Both unstandardized and
standardized estimates are reported
from the LISREL program. Those estimates are equivalent to multiple regression estimates except that the
covariance structural model provides
chi-square values as an additional reference point for the evaluation of the
overall goodness-of-fit of the ecological model.

to an excessive degree. For example, the U.S. census indicates an undercount for the 1980 Mexican
census equal to 3.7 per cent, which is not unusual
(Peach, 1984).

Several findings are noteworthy.
First, the sex ratio is a significant
predictor of Japanese divorce, indicating that the higher the proportion of
males, the higher the divorce rate. This
finding suggests that competition
among males is higher when there are
more males in relation to females in the
region.

Second, population increase from
51980 to 1985 shows a positive relation‘ship with the divorce rate. The unestandardized regression coefficient
%(0.067) indicates that a 1 per cent popAulation increase between 1980 and
21985 was associated with the increase
eof 67 divorces.? This finding supports
cathe findings of Glick (1963) and Goode
(1963). It is almost a truism, as devel"goped by the “urbanization” and funcStional (i.e., Parsons, 1959) schools of
Sdivorce that population increase and its
= related factor of modernization proCmote the disintegration of traditional
‘snorms and values and create pressures
or opportunities for higher divorce
rates.

Third, migration activities significantly influence the divorce rate. A
greater supply of females (due to female in-migration) increases the inci

Since our analysis depends on Japanese census
variables at the prefectural level, it is of great significance that potential dangers of spatial autocorrelation on statistical inference are critically examined. We have examined a Toeplitz matrix structure
to examine the covariance of the data values that
might depend on the data values of adjacent spatial
units. The analysis of the Toeplitz matrix is superior
to that of the Dubin-Watson test as the latter test
merely allows the examination of first-order autoregressive errors (Judge et al., 1985).

We examined the three levels of autoregressive
parameters with Toeplitz structures, (1) first, (2)
second, and (3) third autoregressive errors. T-test
statistic showed —1.11, 0.06, and 1.20, respectively,
and suggested that there were no significant correlations among residuals.

dence of divorce. A gender imbalance
and the subsequent competition in
search of compatible mates reduces the
likelihood of divorce. These patterns
support the findings of Shelton (1987).

Since higher levels of female inmigration reduce the divorce rate, the
social status of women in the commu
_ nity, as influenced by their relative

numbers due to migration, is an important variable. The relative increase of
women due to in-migration significantly reduces the divorce rate in Japan, as Trent and South (1989) and
South (1985, 1988) found in their
American samples.

Fourth, female labor force participation is also a significant predictor of
the divorce rate. The higher the labor
force participation among Japanese females, the lower the divorce rate in the
region. This specific finding is contradictory to the relationship found in the
west. In Japan, however, labor force
participation among women shows a
bimodal distribution according to age:
(1) high labor force participation prior
to the marriage and the immediate termination following their marriage, and
(2) postmarital occupational career
and their underemployment status
for supplementing the family income
(Gibney, 1985). The largest category
of postmarital FLFP is found in the service and support sector and is usually
on a part-time basis (Krooth and Fukurai, 1990). Thus, in Japan, the FLFP
does not reflect an overall economic independence of the female population
but indicates the extent of supplementing the family income as part of the
age-specific gender roles designated
for single and married women.

Last, monthly household income is
negatively associated with the divorce

rate: the greater the household income, the lower the divorce rate. This
finding is also contradictory to our hypothesis in that higher monthly household income reflects the greater economic independence to women that
increases the likelihood of divorce.
Our finding, however, shows the negative effect of monthly household income on divorce rates. It would seem
that Japanese society is unique in several ways.

It is reasonable to assume that average monthly income reflects the extent of household variations based on
social class. The higher the average
monthly household income in the prefecture, the greater the number of
households in higher social classes and
vice versa. The prefectures with larger
proportions of households in the
higher social classes can be characterized as having more families who need
not depend on female labor to supplement their income. A nonworking wife
still remains a strong value among Japanese (Kitagawa, 1987). Thus, there
should be less FLFP in prefectures with
larger concentrations of households at
higher social strata. The prefectures
with larger concentrations of households in the lower social class, on the
other hand, are characterized by lower
levels of economic independence.
There is more likelihood of spouses
working outside the home to support
the family, leading to higher FLFP
which in turn increases the incidence of
divorce. Thus, the average household
income as a proxy for social class variations explains the negative effect of
income on divorce rates.

In addition, as suggested by the negative impact of FLFP on divorce,
highly limited occupational opportuni

ties for women in Japan may not allow
for greater independence of working
women as compared to those who are
nonworking single women or housewives. The common pattern for Japanese women is to work primarily before marriage and after their children
have finished their education (Mosk,
1983). Such a lack of occupational career or long-term work expectations by
both firms and husbands may reduce a
working woman’s potential economic
independence in Japan in contrast to
working wives in other countries.

Unfortunately, the level of data
available precludes a definite explanation. Additional data on the individual
family/household level, or on the intraprefectural level, are needed to support our hypothesis related to the influence of household income on
divorce. Nevertheless, we suspect that
the key to better understanding of the
dynamics of divorce in Japan lies in
household status based on social class
and social contexts, measured by
prefecture-level average household income, the migration pattern of these
prefectures, and their levels of urbanization.

RESIDUAL ANALYSIS

An ecological model provides an
empirical model explaining interprefectural divorce patterns in Japan.
However, several shortcomings of the
model need to be examined. First, our
unit of analysis is at the prefecture
level, while divorce can be captured at
either the regional level (e.g., northwestern and west-central regions) or
intra-regional levels (e.g., counties of
respective prefectures). While the
analysis at the county level might be
ideal, such data is not yet available.
 

Vol. 39, No. 3-4

A second limitation in our analysis is
the potential problem of ecological
fallacies. The ecological fallacy, first
described by Robinson (1950), has received extensive attention by sociologists and demographers. Yet, despite
all their attention, the ecological fallacy is often poorly understood and has
given way to other fallacies. For in

‘otakes into consideration the demoSeraphic and socioeconomic factors that
‘Epre-exist divorce.
© A third limitation in our model is
the relative lack of explanatory power
of eleven exogenous variables on Japanese divorce. Our model explained
approximately 57 per cent of the total
variation of the dependent variable
(an adjusted R? in Table 2). Approximately another half of the total variation of the dependent variable is still
left unexplained by the model. The adjusted coefficient of determination is
not large, particularly considering the
small number of prefectures in the

271

analysis (1=47), though it partially
controls for both the number of independent variables and sample size in
the LISREL model. This unexplained
variation suggests that all the causal
variables of inter-prefectural divorce
rates are not included in our empirical
model.

The second three columns of Table
2 contain the measurement parameter
estimates that both simplified and significantly improved the ecological
model of divorce and attained statistical significance (except population increase).? By fixing the nonsignificant
paths to zero, we gained the five degrees of freedom with a chi-square
value of 6.879. We judge the ratio of
chi-square to its degrees of freedom, as
a method for assessing fit, to be adequate (6.879 to 5=1.37), considering
the small sample size (n= 47). In addition, the goodness-of-fit index (GFT) is
extremely large (0.997) and is very
near the unity. Two indices, Delta and
Rho, are also large (0.989 and 0.958)
and are near the maximum value of
1.0. Those measures refer to the excellent overall fit of the parsimonious
model. The parsimonious model also

3In the saturated model, the direct effect of population density on the divorce rate did not attain statistical significance (¢ test-statistic=1.3). The LISREL estimates excluding all the nonsignificant
direct paths resulted in a chi-square value of 17.594
and 6 degrees of freedom. By observing the modification index, the freeing the constraint of a previously fixed direct path in response to population
density on Japanese divorce improved the overall
goodness-of-fit of the model with a chi-square value
of 6.879 and 5 degrees of freedom. The finding suggests that the direct effect of population density on
the divorce rate can be suppressed because of the
significant indirect effects of the variables that are
fixed to zero in the parsimonious model estimation.
Thus, it is not surprising to observe that the direct
path between population density and the divorce
rate attained statistical significance when other nonsignificant variables are deleted from the model.

implies that there is little difference
between the saturated and the present models since the chi-square value
shows statistically nonsignificant (p <
0.05). Nevertheless, still half of the
variance of the divorce rate is unexplained (0.559 for an adjusted R*), and
further elaborations are necessary to
account for the large proportion of the
unexplained variance.

One of the most effective ways to
examine possible effects of other extraneous variables is to spatially display
the residual of the dependent variable
by controlling for the structural variables in the model. That is, unique divorce rate patterns can be graphically
observed by examining the spatial distribution of unexplained residuals in
each prefecture.

The residual distribution of Figure 3
contains two key findings. First, the effect of regional characteristics on migration is related to the model’s overand under-estimation of the divorce
rate. Table 3 presents the model’s residual values for the divorce rate in 47
prefectures. Not only are there variations among different prefectures, but
there are also inter-prefecture variations within major islands as well. For
example, our empirical model overestimated the divorce rate of four prefectures with large negative residuals:
Tokyo (13), Niigata (15), Shiga (25),
and Kagawa (37). Our empirical model
also underestimated the divorce rate of
eight prefectures with large positive
residuals: Hokkaido (1), Aomori (2),
Kanagawa (14), Tottori (31), Kochi
(39), Fukuoka (40), Miyazaki (45), and
Okinawa (47). The prefectures with
underestimated divorce rates are located in those regions that are physically separated from Japan’s main

 

 

Social Biology

islands. These are viewed by the Japanese as frontier regions. Hokkaido,
forming the northern most island, is
characterized in Japanese folklore and
contemporary stereotypes as wild and
untamed; its inhabitants, including the
ethnic minority group called Ainu, also
share similar characteristics and stereotypes (De Vos, 1973; De Vos and
Wagatsuma, 1966).

Hokkaido and Okinawa constitute
two unique island-prefectures where
the migration is characterized by intraprefectural migration rather than interprefectural or inter-island migration.
Because of the important functions
played by both supply and demand
pools of female migrants impacting regional variations of divorce rates, those
geographically separated prefectures
are culturally more isolated from the
rest of Japanese regions and show
higher incidences of divorce rates.

Another factor leading to the underestimation of the divorce rate in those
two islands is found in the level of analysis necessitated by our data, i.e., the
ecological fallacy. Hokkaido and Okinawa are characterized by distinct cultures and traditions different from the
main-stream Japanese culture and values (De Vos and Wagatsuma, 1966).
The explanation of behavioral variations, such as divorce, using aggregate
information, requires certain assumptions of the linkage between individual
behavioral and areal phenomena. Although the use of aggregate information is undoubtedly useful in explaining
the variation of divorce rates because
such variables best capture socioeconomic and demographic factors in the
region, aggregate data neither reflect
behavioral patterns of individuals, nor
individual specific patterns or decisions

related to divorce. The personal and
more subjective aspects of behavior
patterns are not directly reflected in
the aggregate information. The indigenous values and traits unique to those
two islands need to be carefully examined in order to account for the underestimation of divorce rates in those regions.
., XKephart (1966) and Leslie (1976)
osuggest that the existence of a frontier
“tradition in the American West characterized by rootlessness and nonconSformity are partly responsible for
Ahigher divorce rates in the West than in
the East. We concur with this hypothesis, except that in Japan the “froncotier” seems to be found in its rural
areas rather than elsewhere, especially
gin its northern and southern islands.
6 Another notable finding is the interSprefecture variation among and within
Zislands (esp. Honshu, Shikoku, and
+
OKyushu). Inter-island divorce varia-stions suggest that extraneous and more
micro and behavioral-related variables
‘=may need to be incorporated in the

CONCLUSION

This paper has examined the ecological determinants of contemporary
Japanese divorce rates on the prefectural level. Such a level of analysis demanded the use of the ecological
model which posits that demographic
changes, economic activities, migra

tion patterns, and the level of urbanization are significant predictors of divorce rate.

The present analysis of the ecological model substantiated the argument
that sex ratio, female labor force participation, and female in-migration
patterns all played a significant role in
affecting the divorce rate. Population
increase and net household income
were also important predictors of the
Japanese divorce. Our findings also
confirmed the well-supported hypothesis that both population density and
modernization had positive influences
on modern Japan’s divorce rates
(Makabe, 1980). The residual analysis
also pointed out that in order to account for the large proportion of the
unexplained variance of Japanese divorce, behavioral-related variables and
island- or prefecture-specific dimensions needed to be included in the ecological model of divorce.

The evidence indicated that demographic and aggregate variables such
aS migration, urbanization, and socioeconomic variables have promise when
organized under an ecological model.
The findings of Fenelon (1971), offering a structural explanation based on
the ecological rubric, also had promise
on the cross-national level (see also
Trent and South, 1989) as well as the
intra-national level. Future studies can
refine and extend the ecological model
by determining which socioeconomic
variables linked to relevant demographic variables, such as female labor
participation, gender ratios, and migration, can best be included. _
