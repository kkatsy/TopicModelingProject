Migration has a special interest for the
human biologist and population geneticist
because it is an important evolutionary
force. Its action depends of course upon
the size of the migrant population and the
gene frequencies which obtain in the migrants as well as the host population
(Cavalli-Sforza, 1963; Kiser, 1965). Recognition of the importance of migration in
shaping human populations has prompted
geneticists to attempt to measure rates of
population exchange and to relate these
measurements to other biological parameters. Of special interest have been the
causes and characteristics of the migratory
phenomenon and the migrant individual
(Elizaga, 1966). Central to genetic arguments, however, are the distances migrated,
and the distribution of migrants over these
distances. The commonest measure used by
geneticists has been the interval between
an individual’s place of birth and place of
marriage. The latter is presumed to be the
place of birth of one’s offspring, and the
aim is to measure the distance as it relates
to human generations (Cavalli-Sforza,
1963).

The present report is an effort to characterize in a preliminary manner the migrant

population of Valparaiso; it is preliminary
because the findings to be set forth stem
from research not especially designed for
the analysis of migration. We present the
distribution of immigrants, in this case
spouses, to Valparaiso by sex, distance, and
region of Chile. A relationship will be established between the immigrant spouses
and the places of birth of their parents,
and some characteristics of the individuals
in relation to whether one, both, or none of
his (her) parents were born in Valparaiso
will be described.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The data stem from a survey of the city
of Valparaiso in which the birthplaces of
827 individuals were determined together
with the places of birth of their parents
and four grandparents (Pinto-Cisternas
and Figueroa, 1967). Since interest centered on movement toward Valparaiso and
the places of origin of the migrants, the
parents of each individual have been classified as nonmigrant or migrant depending
upon whether they were or were not born
in the city. To determine the distance of
migration, the parents or spouses were
divided into two groups, namely, (1) both

306 Pinto-Cisternas et al.

spouses born in the same geographic locality and (2) spouses born in different geographic places. Insofar as Group 1 is concerned, obviously either both spouses were
migrants or neither were, but in Group 2
several alternatives arise. These are: (a)
husband born in the city of Valparaiso
(hence a nonmigrant) and wife born elsewhere (a migrant); (2) wife nonmigrant
and husband migrant, and (c) both husband and wife migrants, but from different
places.

To determine the migration distances
the city of Valparaiso was viewed as the
point of origin (more properly, destination)
and from it the different geographic points
were measured in terms of the kilometers
of shortest road intervening between the
place in question and Valparaiso. For a
better analysis in view of the sample size,
some grouping occurred; this involved different places within the province of Valparaiso, and of the provinces of Santiago
and Aconcagua as well as in zones more
than 200 kilometers north or south of
Valparaiso. Foreign individuals were not
subdivided but merely treated as a single
group, i.e., foreign-born. In this form, ten

different zones were considered in the
analysis.

Individuals were also divided on the basis
of the number of their parents born in the
city of Valparaiso, and each of the subsequent three groups were further subdivided
on the basis of whether 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 of
the grandparents were born in the city.
These various groups were then examined
in terms of their ABO blood group distributions, socioeconomic standing, and the
presence or absence of Carabelli’s cusp
(Pinto-Cisternas and Figueroa, 1968). Individuals with one or more grandparents of
unknown place of birth were excluded from
these considerations.

RESULTS

Tables 1 and 2 present the basic data on
the birth places of the parents of 723
residents of Valparaiso. Examination of
these data reveals Valparaiso to be the
most common birthplace of the 1,446 parents and that the frequency with which
parents come from other areas of Chile is
approximately inversely related to the distance of that area from Valparaiso. This
is clearest to the south; to the north there

is an excess of individuals from Zone 1, the
farthest from Valparaiso. The reasons for
this are to be found in the demographic
characteristics of each zone and in the
places of origin of the migrants. Thus, in
Zone 1, most of the migrants are drawn
from seaports and their migration to Valparaiso, Chile’s major port, undoubtedly
reflects occupational opportunities. Valparaiso is, of course, a major focus of migration in Chile as are Santiago, Concepcion
and Valdivia (Elizaga, 1965).

When these data are compared with
those from the 1960 census (Direccion
Estadistica y Censo, 1964, Table 3), which
revealed the number of individuals in Valparaiso in that year born in other provinces,
we find relatively fewer individuals from
the provinces of Santiago and Aconcagua
and more from Tarapaca and Antofagasta.
This difference reflects, we believe, the fact
that the census data are from the entire
province of Valparaiso whereas our data
are from the city alone. It can also be seen
that a slight disproportion exists in the
number of men and women who migrate
to Valparaiso, 52% and 48% respectively.
This difference arises from the number of

men migrating from Zones 2, 4, 7, and
abroad. Most studies have shown men and
women to migrate in almost equal numbers
(Elizaga, 1965).

Figure 1 abridges the findings of Tables
1 and 2 and shows the parent’s birthplace
distribution in the ten zones in which the
sample was divided. Further, it reveals that
most of Valparaiso’s migrants are drawn
from other urban areas rather than from
nonurban localities, because in this figure
the 76% of the geographical places where
five or more individuals were born are cities
with more than twenty thousand inhabitants. The only exception is Zone 8. All
this agrees with the characteristics of the
different zones according to the census data
(see Table 3).

The general distribution of the individuals relating their parents’ and grandparents’ birthplaces to the three variables
previously mentioned revealed great heterogeneity. For this reason, some chi-square
analyses were made considering only the
most contrasting groups, namely, the individuals with 2 parents and 4 grandparents born in the city of Valparaiso, and
the individuals with no parents or grandDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:32 08 December 2015

parents born in the city. None of the
chi-square figures were statistically significant. Only a few tendencies could be
observed in relation to ABO blood groups
and socioeconomic index.
In the first case there was an increase in
the frequency of the O phenotype with an
increasing number of migrant parents and
grandparents. Individuals with 2 parents
and 4 grandparents born in the city of
Valparaiso had the following blood group
frequencies: A, 40.38%; B, 9.16%; and O,
50.00%, For individuals with no parents or
grandparents born in the city the frequencies were: A, 38.34%; B, 6.01%; and O,
56.39%.
In the second case, the data suggest a
better socioeconomic status among those
families which have migrated than among
those which have not. Each home was somewhat arbitrarily evaluated from a socioeconomic point of view, and five alternatives were recognized, namely, very good,
good, acceptable, deficient, and bad (PintoCisternas y Figueroa, 1967). To these
alternatives were given the successive integral values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, averaged
over individual homes, and the means which
emerge were:
individuals with 2 parents born in Valparaiso city, 2.92

individuals with 1 parent born in Valparaiso city, 2.66

individuals with O parents born in Valparaiso city, 2.55

individuals with 2 parents and 4 grandparents born in Valparaiso city, 2.79

Social Biology

individuals with O parents and O grandparents born in Valparaiso city, 2.59.

We can not presently account for this finding which is at variance with most other
studies.

CONCLUSIONS

The most common birthplace of parents
of residents of Valparaiso is the city itself.
Migration to the city is approximately inverse to the distance of a given place from
Valparaiso.

Relatively more of the migration from
neighboring provinces is into the province
of Valparaiso rather than into the city
proper.

There is a slight disproportion in the
frequency with which men and women
migrate to Valparaiso.

Migrants come primarily from other urban areas.

There is somewhat higher frequency of
blood group O among those individuals
with the fewest Valparaiso-born parents
and grandparents.

Inexplicably, the general socioeconomic
status of the migrants is slightly better
than that of the nonmigrants.
