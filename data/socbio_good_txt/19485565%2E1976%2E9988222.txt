Population of Arabian Origin

ABSTRACT: Marital distance, exogamy, inbreeding, admixture, and fertility were studied in 513
families of mixed and unmixed Arabian origin living in Sao José do Rio Preto, Brazil. The 212
unmixed Arabian families were divided into two subgroups: 83 couples married before migration
and 129 couples married after migration. The exogamy index and marital distance were significantly higher for the couples married after migration, and the coefficients of inbreeding for both
autosomal and sex-linked genes were also higher for this subgroup. Admixture was studied in 301
families, most of which were comprised of an Arabian man married to a non-Arabian woman.
The frequency of mixed marriages has increased in recent years. The unmixed Arabian group has
a significantly higher fertility, but it seems to be dependent upon cultural changes over the years.

The history of migration to Brazil shows
roughly two kinds of immigrant groups:
those who mix more easily with the recipient population (Italian, Portuguese,
Spanish) and those who have a tendency
to remain as genetic isolates (Japanese,
Jews, Dutch). The kind of relationship between Brazilians and immigrants seems to
be determined to a large extent by the
communities into which the immigrants
have moved as well as by their distribution in urban or rural areas (Saldanha et
al., 1960; Freire-Maia et al., 1960; Saldanha, 1962; Beiguelman, 1964). Cultural
and biological assimilation naturally takes
place slowly when the immigrants settle as
isolated colonies.

Immigration often causes changes in
gene frequencies, particularly when the
immigrants come from geographical regions distant from the receiving population. However, attempts to avoid mixed
marriages can also lead to unions involving people of the same ethnic origin, but
from geographical regions farther apart
than those that would have been involved
if the marriage had occurred in the land of

origin. This fact can cause an apparent
paradox, the breakdown of the “isolate”
within itself.

After World War I, acurrent of Arabian
migration to Brazil began, with most of
the immigrants being settled in the southern states. This movement lasted until
World War II, when the incentives formerly offered by the Brazilian government
were eliminated, and the political, religious, and economic causes that had
stimulated the enormous emigration of
Arabs ceased (Knowlton, 1960). This report summarizes data on marital distance,
exogamy, inbreeding, admixture, and fertility obtained among Arabian immigrants
and their descendants who live in a southern Brazilian town. Other genetic and anthropological information gathered will be
presented elsewhere.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A total of 513 families of Arabian origin,
living in the urban area of Sao José do Rio
Preto, Sao Paulo, were divided into two
groups: Group I, 212 families of unmixed

Arabian origin, comprised of 83 couples
married before immigrating (Subgroup Ia)
and 129 couples married in Brazil (Subgroup Ib); and Group II, 301 families with
admixture. The Arabian immigrants in
both groups were mostly from Lebanon
(84.1 per cent) and Syria (13.9 per cent).

Marital distance, the exogamy index,
the consanguinity rate, and inbreeding
were studied in Group J; aspects of admixture were studied in Group II. Fertility
was studied in both groups.

Data were collected on the number and
sex of live-born and living children born
during the first twenty years of marriage,
by five-year periods, to women now past
reproductive age (over age 45).

A sample of 12,100 non-Arabian
couples, married in the urban area of Sao
José do Rio Preto from 1948 to 1969, was
studied to estimate the inbreeding rate of
Brazilians in this region.

For each Arabian family, consanguinity
data were obtained by interviews with one
or both consorts. For the non-Arabian
sample, information on consanguinity was
drawn from Roman Catholic Church records. In order to marry, a couple must ask
for a dispensation if they are second
cousins once removed or more closely related. Nearly all marriages in the town are
Catholic.

RESULTS

The average straight-line distances between birthplaces for the 83 couples married before migration (Subgroup Ia) and
for the 129 couples married after migration (Subgroup Ib) were 5.4 + 1.4 km. and
33.4 + 3.5 km. (¢ = 8.09, 210 df, P <
0.001). Similarly, the exogamy index, defined here as the frequency of marriages
involving immigrants born in different
localities, was higher in Subgroup Ib (67
per cent) than in Subgroup Ia (18 per
cent).

Table 1 shows the frequencies of consanguineous and nonconsanguineous marriages in Subgroups Ja and Ib. Although
they do not differ significantly (vy? = 0.64,
1 df, P > 0.30), the mean coefficients of
inbreeding for autosomal genes are strikingly different (0.00245 and 0.00854 for
subgroups Ia and Ib, respectively), the
same being true for the mean coefficients
of inbreeding for sex-linked genes (0.00508
and 0.01078).

The coefficient of inbreeding for the
Brazilian population as a whole was estimated by Freire-Maia (1957) as 0.00200.
Presumably because of the town’s recent
remarkable growth from extensive internal migration, the Catholic sample of Sao
José do Rio Preto showed a very low fre

quency of consanguineous marriages (0.35
per cent for first cousins and 0.09 per cent
for others) and a low rate of inbreeding (F
= 0.00022).

As indicated above, Arabs married after
migration present the highest values of
marital distance and exogamy index, and
surprisingly enough, also the highest degree of consanguinity. However, the mean
marital distance of the 21 consanguineous
marriages, 15.0 + 6.9 km., is significantly
smaller than that of the 108 nonconsanguineous marriages, 37.6 + 3.8 km. (¢ =
2.61, 127 df, P < 0.01). Hence, kinship
between prospective husbands and wives
is not likely to have been the reason for the
marriage of people born far apart.

As Table 2 shows, mixed marriages in

volving non-Arabian women are nearly
four times as frequent as those involving
non-Arabian men (228 versus 55). The
greater contribution of men to racial mixture has also been recorded for immigrants
of other ethnic origins living in Brazil,
such as Portuguese, Italians, Spanish,
Germans, and Japanese (Diegues, Jr.,
1964; Salzano and Freire-Maia, 1970). It is
due in part to the great number of men
who immigrate alone. Another factor is
that men are more independent in the
selection of their partners.

cent years can be inferred from the mean
ages of the 212 unmixed couples (59 +
12.2 years) and of the 301 mixed couples
(46 + 9.8 years). There is a significant age
difference between these groups (¢ = 7.46,
P < 0.001). The increase in mixed marriages can be ascribed to the cultural assimilation process and to the cutoff of immigration after World War II.

Table 3 presents data on the mean ferfility of unmixed (Group T and mixed
(Group IN) Arabian couples for the first
twenty years of cohabitation during the
women’s reproductive period. The values
found for Group I were significantly
higher than those for Group II for all
five-year periods.

In order to identify factors possibly influencing these results, the following four
aspects of the data were analyzed:

1. The mean age of the 167 unmixed (56
+ 10.6 years) and 301 mixed (46 + 9.8
years) couples with completed families.
The significant difference between these
means (t = 5.91, 466 df, P < 0.001) can be
regarded as evidence of differences in the
time of each five years of cohabitation in
the two groups. In other words, by and
large, each five years of cohabitation in
Group I occurred at earlier years than the
respective five-year period in Group II.

2. The mean age at marriage of women
in Group I (22 + 4.5 years) and Group II
(22 + 3.3 years). The means of the two
groups did not differ significantly ¢@ =
1.81, 466 df, P > 0.05).

3. The mean number of children born
during five-year periods of cohabitation,
not considering mother’s age (Table 4).
The numbers decreased similarly in both
groups I and II, when the five-year periods were compared.

4. The mean number of live-born and
living children of 28 pairs of brothers of
unmixed Arabian origin, of similar ages
and cohabitation times (the greatest variance was about 2 years). One member of

each pair was married to an unmixed Arabian woman (live-born children, 3.12 +
0.33; living children, 2.93 + 0.26), and the
other member was married to a nonArabian woman (live-born children, 2.96
+ 0.32; living children, 2.90 + 0.31).
There were no significant differences between the two groups, either in live-born (¢

The distribution of completed family

sizes in Groups I and II is presented in
Figure 1. Group I differs significantly
from Group II (xy? = 67.68, 10 df, P <

was fitted to the data. The goodness of fit
was tested with positive results for both
groups (Group I, x? = 7.62, 9 df, P >
0.50; Group II, x? = 7.56, 8 df, P > 0.30).

The distribution of family sizes was also
compared between the group as a whole

and a sample taken from the same group
in which the couples had more than fifteen
years of cohabitation (98 couples in the
sample from Group I and 219 couples
from Group IJ). Significant differences
were found when the comparison was
made in Group I (yx? = 20.83, 11 df, P <
0.05), but not in Group II (x? = 7.01, 10
df, P > 0.70). This result suggests the
existence within Group I of two kinds of
families: older families with more than fifteen years of cohabitation and with a large
number of children, and younger families
with a smaller number of children.

The average number of live-born children for prolific post-reproductive women
of unmixed Arabian origin was 4.6. While
birth control has been practiced in recent
years by some families in Brazil, the birth
rate for the population as a whole according to the 1970 census (Fundacao IBGE,
1972) was still 5.4, one of the world’s highest.

At first glance, the greater fertility of the
unmixed Arabian group compared to the

mixed group could be attributed to ethnic
factors or to nonhybridity. However,
when the fertility of the 28 pairs of
brothers married to Arabian and nonArabian women is examined, the fertility
difference between mixed and unmixed
couples is not maintained. Considering the
similar age at marriage for women in the
mixed and unmixed groups, the ten-year
difference in mean age for couples with
completed families in the two groups, and
the evidence of fertility reduction through
time in both groups, it seems that sociecultural variables were influential in determining final fertility.
