with Applications to the Four Leading Causes
of Violent Death and to Certain Birth Defects

ABSTRACT: An index which provides a measure of abrupt or sudden change in epidemic trends is
provided. Using this index, a simple comparison of the epidemiology of deaths due to homicides,
suicides, motor vehicle accidents, and other accidents is made. One example of the findings is that
the trend in accidental deaths over recent years possesses more spontaneity or temporal clustering
than the trend in violent nonaccidental deaths. Another application reveals an informative epidemiologic feature of the birth defects tracheoesophageal fistula and esophageal atresia. Implications

of such findings are considered.

In recent years much effort has been
given to developing methods for identify
ing or testing for patterns (mainly clusters)

of disease in space and/or time. Little attention has been given to the development
of measures for the amount of clustering,
to the development of operational
definitions of ‘‘cluster,’’ or to methods of
depicting distinct types of what are loosely
referred to as disease clusters. These matters are fundamentally distinct from
cluster-testing approaches. The lack of
these measures is a serious drawback in
that epidemiologists and sociologists are
limited in what they can deduce about patterns from data.

This paper introduces new ways .of
thinking about epidemiologic processes,
patterns, and trends and introduces a new
index, a type of standardized mortality ratio (SMR) that requires no external controls in its application as does the familiar
SMR. It is applied in this paper to measure
“suddenness” or abrupt behavior of epidemiological or sociological phenomena.

CLUSTERS AND SUDDENNESS

A cluster of people with a given disease
may be identified in a variety of ways. For
example, an observer may note that in a
particular location over a number of years
between zero and ten people acquired a
particular disease each year, but during
the past year fifty people acquired it. An
abrupt change in the trend has occurred.
As another example, perhaps an investigator has noted that for most counties the
annual rate of a disease is two or three per
hundred thousand population but that one
county consistently has a rate of one hundred per hundred thousand population:
Again a cluster is identified. This is a cluster in space. From these examples, one
may easily imagine various hybrids of
these phenomena.

However, any measurement of, or
even acknowledgement of, the existence
or nonexistence of a cluster depends on
the geographic-and temporal scale of the
recorded measurements. For example, a

large dense urban area that experiences
several outbreaks of some bacterial infection each year may be resigned to a fairly
constant (endemic) annual rate. However, if one section of the city of this urban
area, in “monitoring” only itself over the
years, experiences one or more severe
outbreaks, then the residents of that section would certainly register alarm. Yet,
from the perspective of even a smaller
area such as a block within the above section, the experience of a sudden change in
epidemicity may not be as severe. The
sudden change is peculiar to the intermediate area, the section. By envisioning epidemicity via flexible spatial scale, one may
characterize epidemiologic properties of
the disease.

Such characterization also depends on
the temporal scale. If the constant annual
rate of an entire urban area is interrupted
by a large number of outbreaks or by one
or two unusually large outbreaks in one
year, then that urban population experiences a cluster or peak of incidence in that
year. However, suppose that no seasonal
pattern for this disease exists and that several outbreaks occur more or less randomly over the months throughout the
above year, resulting in the high annual incidence. If the population changes its time
scale from a year to a month and, further,
if it monitors the incidence pattern on a
monthly basis only for those twelve
months, it would then experience no sudden change in trend.

The above illustrations suggest a need
for refinement of some of our notions of
“cluster.” In this paper, the term ‘‘cluster’ and its implied concept are reexamined, and an epidemiologic attribute
termed ‘‘suddenness’’ (nearly synonymous with surprise, abruptness, spontaneity) is introduced. Suddenness is a special
type of cluster. Informally, suddenness is
the unexpected occurrence of a large number of events (e.g., cases) within a given

Measuring the ‘‘Suddenness’’ of Events

 

287

period of time, relative to smaller
amounts occurring within similar periods
of time preceding and perhaps following
the period of the large number. This is in
contrast with familiar epidemiologic processes such as cyclic behavior and increasing trends. For example, if eight years of
incidence data in one geographic area of a
fairly stable population are 5, 0,3, 2,3, 17,
2, 2, then a pattern of suddenness is suspected because of the aberrant number of
17 cases in a single year. A more rigorous
definition of suddenness is presented in
the next section.

The concept of suddenness requires a
measure, of course. The interesting new
feature here is that this measurable property of epidemicity depends on the geographic and temporal units. The scales in
the analytical method to be described are
regarded as variables. They are parameters that can be adjusted in order to determine the space-time (S-T) structure that
registers the most suddenness. (A term
like ‘‘suddenness”’ or “‘surprise”’ is amenable to the concept; a real-population epidemiologic experience is registered and
reflected in such a term.)

An important observation offered here
is that nonrandom disease occurrences
have characteristic S-T scale adjustments
for which suddenness is at a maximum,
and that this maximum is measurable.
Furthermore, diseases may be classified in
terms of suddenness measures, possibly
providing a useful epidemiologic taxonomy.

CLUSTER MODULUS

Consider a hypothetical county which
has had a fairly consistent demographic
composition Over many years and has experienced little migration. Suppose that
the incidence of a disease in this county
over the last fifteen years is as follows: 3,
6, 19, 4, 3,5,5,5, 20,5, 2,3, 17,7, 1. BeDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:39 08 December 2015

ginning with the earlier (or later) years
one may group the numbers into pairs
(3,6) (19,4) (3,5)—-or into triplets (3,6,19)
(4,3,5) (5,5,20)—or into quadruplets, and
so On, ignoring terms at the end of the sequence when there are not enough to
finish a group. In this manner, the fifteen
years of incidence may be viewed as a sequence of sequences. Considering the sequence of pairs, one may inquire into the
within-pair distribution of incidence. For
example, the pair (3,6) shows that in these
two consecutive years nine cases of the
disease occurred. It will be necessary to
know the expected maximum number,
E(maxl9, 2), occurring in either of the two
years in a random allocation of r=9
events among the k=2 years. The expected number and the variance are based
on a classical occupancy problem in which
repeatedly one randomly allocates r objects among k cells and asks for the maximum cell count among the cells for each
allocation. Under this sampling scheme,
Mantel et al. (1976) provide tables of the
expected maxima and their variances for
certain values of r and k. The tables pertain to applications of the Ederer-MyersMantel (EMM) cluster test (1964). Pertaining to the first pair (3,6), the average
maximum for the sampling distribution,
E(maxi9, 2), is 5.7. The observed maximum, O(maxl9, 2), is 6.0.

It is important to realize that the distribution of max, and hence an important
property of epidemiologic suddenness,
depends on the magnitude of k. In the
above example, the observed maxima are
at their largest relative tor when k is 5 or 6
and seem closer to what one would expect
under random distributions of incidence
for both larger and smaller values of k. If
enough data were available to be
confident that the observed maximum exceeds the expected (occupancy) maximum
at, say k=S, and if this amount is convinc
ingly greater than for any other value ofk,

then 5 is said to be the multinomial cluster

modulus of the suddenness of the disease.
Essentially the multinomial cluster modulus is that time frame (k) for which on the
average the groups or units have a single
“inordinately large number.”

The multinomial cluster modulus pertains to suddenness in a manner similar to
the way period pertains to cyclic behavior
in that it represents a period of time in
which a complete distinct phenomenon is
optimally portrayed. Three major differences are that (1) cyclic behavior is reasonably predictable or regular whereas in
suddenness each peak follows the previous peak at seemingly unpredictable
(varying) distances, (2) each peak is sudden (a spike) in that there is no monotonic
increase and decrease surrounding it (no
advance or retreat phases), and (3) the
peak in suddenness towers over even the
second largest incidence count in a given
k-year unit. These are real and conceptual
distinctions that are basic to the concept of
suddenness. Similar concepts have been
explored elsewhere (Grimson, 1979).

A STANDARDIZED
MORTALITY RATIO

Figure 1 is a format for incidence data
on M areas for Nk years. Time is envisioned as N units, each composed of k consecutive years. AS-T unit is asingleX-year
period in one area, in accordance with the
discussion in the previous sections. The
EMM test for disease clusters consists of
comparing the observed maximum number O(maxlr, k)—or, for short, O(max)—
of cases of each unit with the expected
maximum, &(max), under the null hypothesis of random occurrence, conditional on k and the total number r of cases.

of the maximum under the null hypothesis. The sum is over all MN units.

We propose the following internally
standardized mortality (or morbidity) ratio:

y%  O(max)
units
—  E(max)
units

This index is the ratio of the observed
maximum annual incidence in the units to
the expected maximum under random occurrence. It may be interpreted as the ratio of the average of the observed maxima
to the average of the expected (random)
maxima. Recall that the expected maxima
are obtained by the multinomial (occupancy) distribution, given & and the unit
totals. They are not based on an external
population source as is the case in the
usual SMR calculations. This SMR provides a measure of the amount that the incidence exceeds what is expected during

the peak or epidemic year (or any other
time unit).

Note that the analysis avoids the use of
rates. It pertains to numerators and is used
wherever population bases are regarded
as fairly stable over short periods of time
(see Ederer et al., 1964, or Grimson,
1979a, for elaboration on this point). The
advantages of this are apparent where
population bases which are required for
the denominators of rates are either not
known or cannot be estimated with adequate accuracy. In the applications which
follow, population bases are not known
for violent deaths occurring in cities and
for the birth defect data.

APPLICATION: VIOLENT DEATHS

North Carolina city (populations of at
least 20,000) and county data were collected for the four major sources of violent
deaths: suicides, homicides, motor vehicle
accidents, and other accidents. Ten years
of city data and five years of county (including the cities) data were collected for
this analysis (seeTable 1).

*The analysis was performed on a refinement of this data; 100 counties and 39 cities were used.

Table 2 provides the SMR’s as defined
above and calculated from these data.

The analysis is based on 78 S-T units (at
k=5) for city data since 39 cities were observed for a ten-year period. At k=5,
there are 100 S-T units for county data
since these data are collected on a fiveyear basis. The numbers of units are larger
for lower values of k.

Since the county data includes the city
data, comparisons of county results with
city results may seem inappropriate. However, each of the hierarchical geographic
units, city and counties, was considered
separately so as to examine the effects on
analysis based on reportable data. Note,
however, that a test of significance for
comparing a summary measure between
city and county data is inappropriate since
the two are not independent. The distinct
advantage of using county data is that they
are typically available in published form.
City data and data based on other geographic units are often difficult to obtain.

Summary observations about violent
deaths in North Carolina, based on the
‘internal’? SMR’s, are: 
1. Deaths by motor vehicle accidents
vary abruptly over time on the county level.
The cluster modulus is at least five years.

2. Homicide, suicide, and deaths by ac
cidents other than motor vehicle cluster toa
lesser degree over time but the optimal spatial unit of these causes of death is the city;
suicide rates appear random over time on
the county level.

3. In general, over the years 1967-76,
accidental deaths appear to occur with
more spontaneity than do purposeful
deaths.

It is important to note that in this data,
large values of x?, are associated with
seemingly low SMR’s. The large x? values
reflect significant clustering based on
much data, i.e., abrupt clustering exists.
The relatively low SMR’s indicate that the
amount of clustering is actually low,
which, while interesting in itself, should
not detract from the main objective of discerning the patterns just described. While
the pattern is statistically significant, it
may be judged not to have much practical
significance (see Table 1).

The next application illustrates SMR’s
which are of a magnitude more typical of
those which alert health investigators to a
problem.

by Knox (1959) and other investigators
and is confirmed in this data by the EMM
test and the scan test (Wallenstein, 1980).
Evidently, the SMR’s are typically in the
vicinity of 1.5. (The N series could have
been partitioned between the ‘‘3”’ and the
“16” but the results would have been similar.) Such sporadic behavior suggests a
careful examination of those years and locations in which the peaks cccurred in order to see if any environmental factor is
also extreme in these space-time loca

tions, which, in turn may offer some clues
regarding the etiology of these anomalies.
In fact, some epidemiologic evidence has
been found which suggests that certain infectious diseases incurred by the pregnant
woman increase the risk of giving birth to
a baby with TF/EA (see Grimson, 1979b,
and Ozimek et al., 1982).

DISCUSSION

The SMR of this paper provides a practical and meaningful way of measuring
abrupt changes in nonrandom incidence
over time and of determining the effects of
spatial and temporal scale on the patterns
of various health conditions. It does not
require population enumeration, such as
are required of denominators of rates,
which is of immense practical value. It is a
measure of the number of cases occurring
during an epidemic or period (e.g., year)
of excessive mortality or morbidity, relative to the maximum number expected if
the cases had occurred randomly over the
consecutive periods (years).

The calculated value of the SMR depends on the total number of cases in each
of the units because E(max) and O(max)
depend on these totals; hence it would
usually depend on the population sizes of
the units. That is, the relative sizes of
E(max) and O(max) depend on the total

Social Biology

number of cases, which in turn depends on
unit population sizes even though there
may be no difference among units in the
underlying epidemiologic casual processes of the condition. The SMR, which is
a ratio of the sum of the O(max)’s to the
sum of the E(max)’s, would change
slightly if, for example, one county tripled
in population for each year of observation. The total number of cases may increase, so the values of E(max) and
O(max) may change in a way for which the
SMR would not remain constant. Also,
SMR’s may vary over geographic areas,
racial composition of the units, etc. One
may control for such situations by
stratification. SMR’s may be calculated
for various groups and, if desired, a summary SMR may be estimated by taking a
weighted average of the component
SMR’s. One choice of weights is the inverse of the Ederer-Meyers and Mantel
(1964) variance for each group. Letting V,
be the variance for the jth group, the adjusted SMR is

In addition to the SMR providing a
measure of temporal clustering, the SMR

those space-time units which experience
high numbers of cases, For example, those
county-years that produce the large
significant O(max)’s could be singled out
for special analysis, perhaps utilizing the
other county-years as controls. Then a discriminant or case-control analysis may
identify county-year factors (e.g., infectious diseases, economic indicators,
changes in the industrial profile) that explain the grouping.

As a simple example of identifying factors that are associated with the high SMR
counties, consider SMR findings for motor vehicle accidents. This cause of death
produced high SMR’s. Upon inspection of
the county data it was noted that the observed maximum in 41 of the 100 five-year
units occurred during 1973. In November
of 1973, North Carolina changed its 65
mph speed limit to 55 mph. This change
may partially explain the relatively high
SMR’s for this cause of death. An abrupt
drop in the number of motor vehicle fatalities was noted in 1974. Explanations for
the SMR findings for the other violent
causes of death require a more complex
analysis.

The measure (SMR) provided here has
potential for classification purposes. Sociologists, for example, may be able to enhance their understanding of various phenomena by elucidating common and

Measuring the ‘‘Suddenness’”’ of Events 293

divergent features of patterns. Multiple
applications of the EMM test and construction of SMR’s as introduced here are
one method of approaching such an understanding. (Significant levels and pvalues obtained by this multiple testing
cannot be interpreted in the traditional
sense, relating to hypothesis testing,
rather they are simply used as indicators of
optimal scaling of the S-T unit, wherever
clustering exists.)

Further motivation for conducting an
analysis of abrupt changes of sociological
or epidemiological phenomenon over
time, within a variety of spatial and temporal scales, is that wherever such changes
are found to occur, investigators will then
have geographical and temporal coordinates on which to focus in investigating
causes. Also, by similar analyses, other
phenomena may be sought with a pattern
of clusters that correlate with the pattern
of interest.
