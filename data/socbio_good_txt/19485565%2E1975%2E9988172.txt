Effects of Social Epidemiological Factors
on the Severity of Disability for White

and Nonwhite Disabled

Thomas T. H. Wan

Department of Sociology

Baltimore, Maryland

One of the major problems facing disability research is the difficulty of identifying differential effects of chronic conditions and impairments on _ capacity
limitations. The identification of disabling
effects is essential in understanding the
extent of a work limitation as a result of
the specific conditions (diseases or injuries) in different social and environmental contexts. Moreover, the purpose of
social epidemiological research is to study
the various capacity limitations resulting
from social factors so that the research
findings may enhance our understanding
of the disabling effects and, in turn, may
help facilitate more intelligent assessment
of present needs of the rehabilitative programs dealing with different categories of
the disabled.

In previous studies of disability, it was
found that persons who have the same
condition may not necessarily be incapacitated to the same extent, whereas those
who have the same level of work limitation
due to health reasons may be afflicted
with different disabling conditions (Haber,
1971; Levenson and Green, 1965; Taylor
and Fairrie, 1968). In analyzing data

 

 

 

from the Social Security Survey of the
Disabled, Haber (1969) reported that, in
general, the diagnostic classification of
major disabling conditions was not a
strong predictor of the severity of the disability. His finding has cast some doubt
on the validity of using only the medical
classification of health conditions as a
criterion to determine the severity of the
disability.

The purposes of this study are: (1) to
validate Haber’s findings on the disabling
effects of chronic conditions; (2) to employ an epidemiological model of agent,
host, and environmental factors in determining the relative influences of social
epidemiological factors on the severity of
disability; (3) to study the differentials in
the severity of disability; and most importantly (4) to determine the nature of the
differences in disabling effects of agent,
host, and environmental factors for white
and nonwhite disabled males.

The concept of “epidemiological triad”
is used as an analytic framework for explaining the complex relationship of the
disabling effects to the epidemiological
triad—agent, host, and environment. In

this study, the agent factors, represented
by the nature and the duration of a work
limitation, are: the major disabling condition, the secondary impairment, and the
length of the major disability. The host
factors of the disabled are: occupation,
education, and age. The environmental
factors indicate work settings, using industry and residence background/residence
status as indicative of exposure factors to
environmental hazards.

The major hypothesis is that the severity of the disability (SD) is the function
(f) of agent (A), host (#), and environmental (£) factors. That is: SD = f (A,
H, E) + error term (see Figure 1). More
specifically, it is hypothesized that the
extent of a work limitation (i.e., the severity of the disability) of the disabled is
more strongly affected by host factors than
by agent and environmental factors alone,
irrespective of race.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data source for this research is the
national Survey of Economic Opportunity
(SEO)! conducted in the spring of 1967
by the Bureau of the Census for the Office
of Economic Opportunity. The SEO sample covered 357 primary sampling units
comprising 701 counties and independent
cities in the United States. The sample
design consisted of two parts: (1) a selfweighting sample comprising approximately
18,000 households drawn by the same
method and having the same geographic
coverage as the Current Population Survey; and (2) a supplemental sample of
roughly 12,000 households in predominantly nonwhite areas of large cities.

In this research, the study population
was limited to civilian, noninstitutional

ized male family heads between the ages
of 25 and 64. This limitation overcomes
the irregularities that would be introduced
by using a more heterogeneous universe.
In order to examine the hypotheses more
scrupulously by using statistical analyses,
only the self-weighting sample of this survey was used. The study sample consisted
of 1,575 whites and 711 nonwhites who
were disabled male heads of families.
Data on health or physical conditions
were obtained by the answers to the following three questions: (1) Does your
health limit the kind of work you can do;
limit the amount of work you can do; or
keep you from working? (2) In what way
are you limited? (3) How long have you
been limited in this way? Data were collected only on the condition considered
primarily responsible for work limitation,
ie., the disabling condition. The major
disabling conditions were classified into
eleven categories based on the Eighth Revision of International Classification of
Diseases (US. Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1969).2 The severity of

and Welfare, Eighth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases, Adapted for Use
in the United States, Vol. 1, Public Health Service Publication No. 1693, 1969, Twenty-two categories of primary health impairments or disabling conditions were listed in the 1967 “Survey
of Economic Opportunity Codebook.” These categories were recoded into eleven major disease
categories in accordance with the Eighth Revision
of the International Classification of Diseases,
Adapted for Use in the United States, as follows:
(1) musculoskeletal disorders including arthritis
or rheumatism, missing arms and legs, and crippled, deformed limbs; (2) cardiovascular disorders including hypertension, heart trouble, stroke,
or cerebral hemorrhage; (3) respiratory and related disorders including asthma or hay fever,
other allergies, tuberculosis, emphysema, and
bronchitis; (4) digestive disorders including hernia or rupture and ulcers; (5) mental illness; (6)
nervous system disorders including epilepsy and
paralysis; (7) cancer, malignant neoplasms; (8)
diabetes; (9) visual impairments; (10) hearing
impairments; and (11) other and unspecified conditions including speech defects, other health
problems, and unspecified disability.

the disability was determined by the extent of work limitation. Severe disability
refers to persons unable to work; occupational disability refers to persons with limitations on both the kind and amount of
work they can do; and secondary work
limitations refers to those who are limited
in either the kind or amount of work they
can perform. The secondary impairment
or disability was the second condition
which limited one’s ability to work. The
disabling conditions were not of a temporary nature and were expected to last
longer than three months.

Occupation referred to the longest civilian job of an individual in 1966 and was
classified into eight broad census occupational types.? Educational levels were measured by the highest grade of completed
schooling and were classified into six categories: O-4, 5-8, 9-11, 12, 13-15, and
164-. Four age groupings were: 25-34,
35-44, 45-54, and 55-64. The residence
status/residence background factor is determined by whether or not a person was
a rural resident in the survey year (1967)
and whether he had also lived in a rural
area in the previous years, that is, one
who had a rural background. Industry referred to the kind of activity carried out
by the establishments in which the person
worked. The classification of industry was
based upon 1960 census industry categories and included nine groupings in this
study.*

3 The categories of major occupation were those
used by the Bureau of the Census in 1960. In order to present more useful findings, certain categories were collapsed in this study. Professional,
technical and kindred workers became “professionals and managers.” Farmers and farm managers and farm laborers and foremen became
“farmers and farm managers.” Clerical and kindred workers and sales workers became “clerical
and sales workers.” Private household workers
and service workers became “service workers.”

The data were analyzed by dummy variable multiple regression analysis (Orcutt
et al., 1961; Feldstein, 1966; Morgan et
al., 1962; Shah and Abbey, 1971; Elwood
et al., 1971; Suits, 1957). In this analysis,
each dummy variable represents a single
subclass of a factor. The individual is
assigned a value of one if he belongs to the
subclass, and zero if he does not. Each factor—e.g., age (@,)—is converted into a set
of regressor variables (e.g., a, @2, and a3)
equivalent to the number of subclasses
minus one. The use of dummy variable
regression analysis does not involve making any assumptions about the linearity of
the effect (Miller and Erickson, 1974).
The relation between the dependent variable, severe disability (Y), and the independent variables (major disabling condition, secondary impairment, length of
disability, etc.) is analyzed by the least
squares method. For example, we are interested in knowing the effect of agent
factors on severe disabilities. A regression
equation is formulated as follows: Y =
BoXo -+- ByX -+ BoXe ... BioX10 + U,
where Xo is a constant; X; to Xg represent the 8 subclasses of major disabling
conditions; Xg9 represents the variable of
secondary impairment; X49 is the variable
of Iength of the disability; and U is an unmeasured error, with E(U) = 0.

The least squares estimates (2) of the
regression coefficients (B) were computed
and then used for calculating the per cent
deviations from average risk of having
severe disabilities. The deviation measures

reference period established for data on economic
characteristics, or last worked, if unemployed.
The activity of the establishment means the kinds
of goods or services produced. The SEO data on
industry referred to the work establishment in
which one worked in 1966. Nine groupings of
industry are: agriculture and mining; construction; manufacturing; transportation, communications, and public utilities; wholesale and retail
trade; finance, insurance, real estate, business and
repair services; service and miscellaneous; public
administration; and industry not reported.

Social Biology

the increased or decreased risk (probability) of being severely disabled in a given
subclass of a factor. The deviations (d)
were then expressed as per cent deviation
from the grand mean. The unadjusted deviations are the differences between the
subclass means and the grand mean,
whereas the adjusted deviations are the
differences of these two means when other
factors in the multivariate analysis are
simultaneously controlled. Moreover, the
variations between unadjusted and adjusted deviations indicate that the explanatory variables are intercorrelated. Thus,
the evidence is provided that the adjustment for the spurious relationship between
the dependent variable and the independent variable is necessary. The per cent
deviations adjusted simultaneously all
variables and intercorrelations among them
represent the net effect of an independent
variable.

It is important to note that we are interested in investigating the relative influence of each social epidemiological factor
on the severity of the disability. The emphasis is on each factor as a whole, rather
than as a subclass. Therefore, eight factors
(industry, occupation, etc.) with 35 subclasses are simultaneously included in a
regression equation. From this equation,
beta coefficients and F-ratios were computed using the same procedures employed
by Morgan and his associates.5 Since the
disabling effects of social epidemiological
factors were examined independently for
the white and nonwhite disabled, separate

5 Beta coefficient (representing the importance
of a factor relative to other factors) is the measure of the contribution to error reduction and
is computed from the square root of the weighted
sum of squares of adjusted deviations divided by
the standard deviation of the dependent variable.
The F-test used in examining the significant effect of each factor is made by treating the adjusted deviations like a set of means and applying a simple one-way analysis of variance. The
detailed procedures of the significance test have
been suggested by Morgan et al. (1962).

equations were formulated for the two
populations.

RESULTS

According to the proposed social epidemiological model in Figure 1, it was
postulated that the eight social epidemiological factors would exert an independent
influence on the severity of the disability.
Furthermore, host factors were expected
to be more important in accounting for
the variation on the severity of the disability than agent and _ environmental
factors.

The coefficient of multiple determination (R*) can be used as a conservative
estimate of variance explained by the independent variables included in the regression equation. Data in Table 1 reveal
that when all social epidemiological factors are included, they account for more
than two-fifths of the variation on the
severity of disability, 45 per cent for
whites and 43 per cent for nonwhites. The

average risk (grand mean) of being severely disabled among the male family
heads is 0.26 for whites and 0.37 for nonwhites; the respective standard deviations
are 0.44 and 0.48. A careful inspection of
Table 1 reveals that host factors of both
white and nonwhite populations exert
more impact than do agent and environmental factors alone. The explanatory
powers of the two factors, length of disability and residence status/residence
background, are negligible. Occupation,
one of the host characteristics, and industry, an indicator of environmental conditions, account for a considerably larger
proportion of the main effect on severe
disabilities than do the other characteristics for both populations.

These findings were substantiated by
an intensive analysis of the relative importance of each of the social epidemiological
factors affecting severe disabilities (Table 2). The beta coefficient measures the
size of standard deviation in the risk of

being severely disabled when there is one
standard unit of change on a particular
independent variable, holding other variables as constant. For example, one unit
of change on the industry scale of the
white disabled will produce a concomitant
net change in risk involved of being severely disabled of about 0.46. This measure is an analogue to the beta coefficient
of multiple correlation, but it applies to
whole sets of coefficients involved in a
factor rather than a subclass of the factor.
The relative influences of the eight factors
were ranked in terms of the magnitude of
the coefficients. However, the sign of the
coefficient is not shown here, but it is indicated in the measures of the deviations.
The value of rank-order correlation (Kendall t, = 0.79) indicates that the overall
relative importance of the selected factors
affecting severe disabilities is not significantly different between the two disabled
groups under study. However, it is worth
noting that for whites, disabling conditions were found to be more influential
than education in determining the risk of
being severely disabled, but a reverse order of importance was found for nonwhites. Perhaps this reverse order exists

because the jobs filled by nonwhites require less education on the average so
that when the major condition occurs, the
chances of a nonwhite finding another job
with similar or fewer educational requirements are considerably diminished.

The relative importance of secondary
impairments was ranked higher for whites
than for nonwhites. This finding implies
that nonwhites have been largely eliminated from the job market after incurring
one major disabling condition while some
whites are given a second chance. An examination of the F-ratios for the coefficients shows that among the nonwhite disabled, all eight coefficients are statistically
significant, but among the white disabled,
only six of the eight coefficients (with the
exception of two factors, Jength of disability and residence status/residence background) are significant.

The detailed analysis of the differentials in disabling effects of each of the
eight social epidemiological factors was
carried out by means of a statistical method
using deviations and per cent deviations
from the average risk (grand mean of 0.26
for whites, and 0.37 for nonwhites) as a
basis for comparison. Measures of devia—|

tions were further adjusted for all variables. The importance of each subclass
of a factor was determined by the magnitude of the per cent deviation; the higher
the per cent deviation, the stronger the
effect (risk) on severe disabilities. A positive deviation means an individual’s risk
is higher than that of an average disabled
person of having a severe work limitation,
and vice versa.

AGENT FACTORS

In this study, agent factors refer to the
major disabling condition, the secondary
impairment or disability, and the length
of the major disability. For both whites
and nonwhites, musculoskeletal disorders
and cardiovascular disorders account for
approximately 57 per cent of the major disabling conditions reported by the disabled

male heads of families (Table 3). In addition, an index of dissimilarity was computed from the percentage distributions
and indicated no significant differences
were to be found between the two disabled
populations in terms of the distributions
of the disabling conditions. Among whites,
the risks of having severe work limitations
were higher for certain disabling conditions, i.e., cardiovascular disorders, mental illness, nervous system disorders, cancer, and visual and hearing impairments,
than for the other conditions. It appears
that cancer is one of the most severely disabling conditions affecting work limitations reported by whites. Almost the same
patterns were found among the nonwhite
disabled, with the exception of cancer
which was not reported by nonwhites, In
addition, however, two more conditions,

respiratory and related disorders and diabetes, appear to be influential on severe
work limitations among nonwhites.

Among those who had more than one
disabling condition (about one-fifth of the
disabled), the risk of being severely disabled appeared to be higher. Since the
extent of work limitation is related to disability, the relationship shown in Table 4
is not surprising.

Small proportions of the disabled were
identified as having a short-term work
limitation: 5 per cent for whites and 6
per cent for nonwhites (Table 5). The fact
that the duration of disability has an insignificant effect on the severity of the disability is probably a consequence of dichotomizing the factor into long-term (6

and more months) and short-term (less
than 6 months) disability. A careful analysis should use a detailed breakdown of
the length of disability. For both disabled
populations, persons who had a short-term
disability had a lower risk of being severely disabled than those who had a longterm condition.

HOST FACTORS

Host factors are characterized by an
individual’s occupation, education, and
age. Occupation exerted a pronounced influence on the severity of the disability.
The percentage distributions of occupation were quite different between whites
and nonwhites. The white disabled in
white-collar occupations numbered 2.5

times as many as their nonwhite counterparts, and they had a smaller risk of being
severely disabled than had the latter (Table 6). There are several striking findings
revealed from the adjusted deviations and
their per cent deviations: (1) Laborers
had a great risk of being severely disabled.
(2) Farmers and farm managers for both
disabled populations had a lower risk of
being severely disabled than other workers. (3) Persons who did not report an
occupation and were unemployed had the
highest risk of being severely disabled for
whites, but not for nonwhites. (4) Four
occupations—clerical and sales workers,
craftsmen and foremen, operatives, and
services—appeared to have more risk than
other occupational groups to severe work
limitations for nonwhites, but not for
whites.

The white disabled had higher educational levels than the nonwhite disabled.
Among whites, the risk of being severely
disabled was almost inversely related to

educational levels; the probability of reporting severe disabilities increased as
the amount of education attained decreased (Table 7). Among nonwhites, the
pattern of the relationship was erratic.
However, nonwhites who had completed
a high-school education were somewhat
more likely to report severe disabilities
than other persons with both a higher and
a lower educational level. The difference
between the crude risks (unadjusted per
cent deviations) of the lowest and the
fourth group of education factor was substantial, with a ratio of 5:1. When net
risks (adjusted per cent deviations) were
considered, the difference changed to a
ratio of 1:2. This decreased effect of education was the result of adjustment for
all variables.

Age had less effect on the severity of
disability than occupation and education.
About 40 per cent of all disabilities occurred in the older ages (55-64). In general, the risks of being severely disabled

that younger white disabled family heads
(aged 25-34) had a relatively low risk
(48.9 per cent below average), whereas
older family heads had a high risk (41.3

disabilities. The risks of nonwhite disabled

groups were 34.1 per cent below average
and 34.2 per cent above average. After
simultaneous adjustment for all variables,
the risk of white disabled family heads at

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

Industry, by itself, appeared to be an
important factor in determining the risks
of severe work limitations. Those who did
not report an industry had the highest
risk of being severely disabled, 234.2 per
cent above the average among whites and
159.5 per cent above the average among
nonwhites (Table 9). However, persons
in all other industry categories had consistently low risks. The lowest risk for
whites was in the category of services and
miscellaneous group, 71.1 per cent below
average, and that for nonwhites was in the
category of public administration, 82.5
per cent below average. Adjustments for
all factors increased slightly the risk of
all industry categories and reduced the
risk of persons with industry not reported.
The net effect of industry was much

245

smaller than indicated by the unadjusted
per cent deviations.

Residence status/residence background
was a significant factor in studying the
severity of disability for nonwhite disabled heads, but not for whites. About
39.4 per cent of whites and 28.4 per cent
of nonwhites were of rural backgrounds
and were currently living in a rural area
(Table 10). Whites who were from a rural
background and were currently living in
a rural area had a slightly higher risk of
being severely disabled, 3.5 per cent above
average. After adjustment for all variables,
the net risk decreased to 2.3 per cent below average. Since these deviations were
not significantly different from average,
the risk of white disabled heads in severe
disabilities was not explained by the residence status/residence background factor.

For nonwhite disabled family heads, the
unadjusted per cent deviation was 20.1
per cent below average for those of a
rural residence and with a rural background, and the adjusted per cent deviation was 9.4 per cent below average. The
risk was therefore higher for nonwhites
in the other residence categories than for
those with a rural background and of a
rural residence.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Haber’s statement (1969) that there is
no meaningful relationship between the
type of disabling condition and the severity of the disability is validated in this
study. The major disabling condition, one
of the agent factors, had an important effect on the severity of the disability; however, its relative importance was more
pronounced in white than in nonwhite
disabled populations. The statistical analysis indicates the relevance of using the
disabling condition as a predictor of severe disabilities, but it is insufficient to
suggest that there is any meaningful link
between the type of disabling condition
and the severity of a work limitation. The
reason for this conclusion is twofold:
(1) The disabling conditions obtained

from this survey are the reporting health
events, but not the outcomes of a physical
or medical examination. Thus, the severity
of the disability is unknown by its medical
standard and, in turn, is determined by
the extent of work limitations resulting
from the chronic conditions and impairments. (2) The concept of severe disability has a social meaning in terms of work
role and role performance that disabled
persons are no longer able to work or
cannot work regularly. As a result of these
limitations, the type of the reported
chronic condition is not meaningfully related to the severity of the disability.
Furthermore, it is invalid to assume that
persons with the same type of condition
should have the same disabling outcomes,
since other social and environmental factors may also play an important part in
the disabling effect.

The influence of the secondary disability, a second important agent factor, was
found significant for both white and nonwhite disabled populations. The risk of being severely disabled was greater for those
who had multiple conditions than for
those who reported only one work-limiting
condition. Examination of the data on the
length of the major disability reveals that

Vol. 22, No. 3

it is an important disabling factor for
nonwhites, but not for whites. Some of the
possible reasons for this finding should be
explored. A white who has had a longterm condition may still be able to function (work) normally as long as he can
cope with most of the difficulties, whereas
a nonwhite who has had a short-term condition may play a sick role and stop working for reasons other than the medical
problems. Both long-term and short-term
conditions are equally detrimental to one’s
work role, and the fact is that if the longterm disabled have extensive training in
skills appropriate for transferring or relocating to another less physically demanding job, they could have a better chance
of reporting a moderate work limitation.
Where these favorable characteristics are
absent (that is, where the disabled are not
very well trained and are unskilled workers), the relationship between severe disabilities and the length of disabilities
appears to be germane.

At the onset of the disabling condition,
factors such as occupation, education, and
age were important because these host
characteristics may help explicate the
complicated phenomenon of social handicaps, or more critically speaking, social
discriminations of the disabled. The analysis has shown that host factors did exert
a significant influence on severities of
work limitations. The most pronounced
disabling effect occurred in regard to occupation, with the highest risk (39.7 per cent
above average) for nonwhite laborers
compared to the lowest risk (13.4 per cent
below average) for farmers and farm managers in reporting severe work limitations.
Thus, it appeared that the self-employed
workers were less likely to be limited by
the disabling condition. This interpretation is supported by the finding of Morgan
et al. (1962) in studying the economic
position of the disabled. Among nonwhites

Social Epidemiological Factors in Disability

247

whose occupations were clerical and sales,
craftsmen and foremen, operatives, and
Services, reports from these areas were
more likely to show severe disabilities.
The plausible explanation for this finding
may relate to the job market in that nonwhite skilled workers would be less likely
to be employed if they were disabled.

An apparent inverse relationship between education and the severity of the
disability was found, especially among
white disabled populations. Though education appeared to be an important factor
among nonwhite disabled populations, its
relation to severe disabilities was not
clear. For example, the risk of a nonwhite
high-school graduate was almost two times
that of a person with a low educational
attainment in reporting a severe work limitation. The interpretation of this striking
finding is made possible if we assume that
vocational training at the high-school level
is most important for nonwhite high-school
graduates in order for them to have a low
risk of being severely limited. Thus, nonwhites with sufficiently specialized skills
would compensate for their lack of advanced education even though they had a
work-limiting health condition.

Age is positively related to the severity
of the disability, with a high risk in old
ages and a low risk in young ages for both
disabled populations. This finding was not
unexpected since chronicity of disease advanced with age, and those who had a later
onset of disease would likely be at greater
risk of being unable to engage in work
(Smith and Lilienfeld, 1971).

The analysis revealed that industry, an
indicator of environmental characteristics,
was the most significant factor of all selected variables under study. For whites,
those working on construction, where
heavy labor was required and many risks
of being severely limited by the job were
encountered, had a higher risk of being

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

248

severely disabled than those working in
the other industries. For nonwhites, those
who reported an industry had a considerably lower risk than those whose industry
was not reported. The net effect of industry was slightly reduced, when other
factors (variables) were simultaneously
considered.

The disabled who were currently living
in rural areas and also had a rural background had a low risk of being severely
disabled compared with the average disabled person. It is possible that they faced
less environmental restraint since they
were more likely to have a farming occupation and work in an agricultural industry.

The central thesis of disabling effects of
social epidemiological factors posits that
the risk of being severely disabled is conditioned by agent, host, and environmental
characteristics of the disabled. The effects
of disabling conditions on work limitations
cannot be clearly confirmed unless social,
host, and environmental factors are also
considered. Thus, researchers on disability
studies who utilize the concept of the epidemiological triad as an analytic tool may
find it valid and useful. However, methodologically, there were several pitfalls with
respect to the dummy variable multiple
regression analysis used in this study. The
major problem was that the analysis violated the statistical principle of homoscedasticity assumption; therefore, the

Wan

 

Social Biology

significance tests for the R? presented in
Table 1 were not done. Secondly, the statistical tests done for the beta coefficients,
which measured the relative importance of
a factor and were computed from a complex multivariate procedure, were less
precise than one would desire. Moreover,
a rigorous statistical technique should be
applied in analyzing the quantifiable
rather than the qualifiable data.

Further research on the effects of disabling factors should be made by collecting pertinent data on detailed working
histories and complete health information
obtained from medical diagnosis and
prognosis. It is also necessary to develop
a rigorous statistical model to identify the
disabling risk from a probabilistic approach. In addition, the interactions of
agent, host, and environmental factors
involved in the disabling effects should
be detected and interpreted.
