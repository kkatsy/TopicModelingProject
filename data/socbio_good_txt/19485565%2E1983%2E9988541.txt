Annual Rhythms in Human Violence
and Sexual Aggression in the United States
and the Role of Temperature

ABSTRACT: Violent crimes committed during two to three consecutive years in sixteen different
locations in the United States were examined for annual rhythms using the cosinor method of
analysis. Annual changes in rapes and in the more numerous aggravated assaults were highly
significant in the majority of locations. They were closely related to each other in time and
showed maxima generally between July and August. The data suggest that rape may comprise
a subpopulation of assaultive behavior. In contrast, there were seasonal rhythms for robbery in
only five locations with maxima between November and December. There was a virtual absence
of any seasonal changes in murder. A close statistical association was established between annual assault and rape rhythms and annual temperature fluctuations in the different locations.
This finding suggested that certain aspects of human violence may be influenced by exterocep

tive factors.

Exteroceptive factors such as temperature, humidity, and photoperiod
are known to influence the timing of reproductive activity in many seasonallybreeding species (Bissonnette, 1932;
Dawson, 1941; Benoit and Assenmacher, 1953; Myers and Poole, 1962; Thibault et al., 1966; Lincoln and Davidson, 1977). It is also known that some of
these factors are mediated by neuroendocrine pathways (Harris, 1955). A
familiar example would be the rut of
stags which is initiated by the falling
light phase in autumn. Declining photoperiod causes pituitary activation of the
gonads, increased testosterone secretion, antler growth, increased aggressive displays, and then mating behavior
(Lincoln, Youngson and Short, 1970).

It is less well-known that many species of higher primates also show increased testosterone secretion, increased aggression, and increased
sexual activity in the autumn and winter
(Michael and Zumpe, 1976; Van Horn,

1980). Rhesus monkeys, for example,
exhibit an autumn mating season and a
spring birth season in both northern and
southern hemispheres (Lindburg, 1971;
Bielert and Vandenbergh, 1981), and
the mating season is associated with increased plasma testosterone levels in
males as well as with increased aggression (Robinson et al., 1975; Gordon et
al., 1978; Michael and Zumpe, 1981a).
Clearly, then, exteroceptive factors are
implicated in the entrainment of seasonal changes in the sexual and aggressive behavior of higher primates.

What, then, of our own species? In
man, of course, social and cultural constraints presumably tend to override any
environmental influences, especially in
societies where these are attenuated by
the use of clothing, and by artificial
lighting, heating, and air-conditioning.
In richer communities, food and contraceptives are constantly available. Nevertheless, tantalizing data have recently
emerged concerning the possibility of

263

seasonal effects on plasma androgen
levels and sexual activity in men (Smals
et al., 1976; Reinberg and Lagoguey,
1978). Other seasonal effects include
those on conceptions (Ronnike, 1981),
births (James, 1971; Parker, 1978; Sandahl, 1978; Warren and Tyler, 1979;
Kenny and Ritter, 1981), menarche
(Brundtland and Liestol, 1982), menstrual cycle length (Sundararaj et al.,
1978), the diurnal timing of the ovulatory LH surge (Testart, Frydman and
Roger, 1982), and on affective disorders
(Meares, Mendelsohn and Milgromfriedman, 1981; Parker and Walter,
1982).

However, it is the data base provided
by the criminal statistics of nineteenthcentury pre-industrial Europe that gives
the clearest indication of seasonal effects on human aggressive and sexual
behavior. In the 1840’s, Adolphe
Quetelet, the father of ‘“‘moral statistics,” wrote to the Grand Duke of SaxeCoburg and Gotha:

Who does not know that the severities of
winter, by multiplying wants, cause in society a greater number of crimes against
property, while they deaden the passions,
which again wake with more ardour and
danger at the return of the spring, and
during the heats of summer? It is then
that we see acts of violence break out,
that revolt is organized and spread with
more rapidity—that our intelligence, too
ready to exalt itself, overleaps the last
limits of reason.

The studies of Quetelet and of other
nineteenth century authorities (Quetelet, 1849; Aschaffenburg, 1913; Ferri,
1917; Lombroso, 1918) led to the formulation of the “‘thermic law of crime,”
which held that crimes against the person (e.g., murder, assault, rape, rebellion) increased, while crimes against
property (e.g., robbery, burglary, theft,
larceny) decreased, with seasonal and

geographical increases in temperature.
Then and now, opinions have been divided as to whether seasonal factors act
directly, for example, by increasing peoples’ “irritability” and “‘vitality,” or indirectly, for example, by changing the
frequency of social interactions (work
and vacation schedules, employment
levels, clothing) and the intensity of economic hardship.

Either way, in view of the profound
technological, demographic, and economic changes that have occurred in the
last hundred years, it might be expected
that seasonal influences on crime would
either be considerably reduced or entirely obliterated in the modern United
States. In fact, law enforcement and
rape crisis center personnel are acutely
aware of the summer increases in assaults and rapes, and more recent publications have made similar comments
(von Hentig, 1948; Falk, 1952; Amir,
1971; Hayman et al., 1972).

However, these studies have used
few sample areas and either failed to test
the significance of any annual changes in
crime rates or found none. Hence, it has
not been possible to make a valid assessment of the relationship between crime
rates and differences in exteroceptive
factors in different geographical locations. The present study was therefore
undertaken to assess the significance of
seasonal changes in assaults, rapes, robberies, and murders in a number of different locations in the United States and
to relate them both to each other and to
seasonal and geographical differences in
temperature and photoperiod.

violence are as follows (abbreviated):
(1) Forcible rape is the carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her
will. Assaults or attempts to commit
forcible rape by force or threat of force
are also included; however, statutory
rape (without force) and other sex offenses are not included in this category.
(2) Aggravated assault is an unlawful attack by one person upon another for the
purpose of inflicting severe or aggravated bodily injury. This type of assault
is usually accompanied by the use of a
weapon or by means likely to produce
death or great bodily harm. (3) Robbery
is the taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or
control of a person by force or threat of
force or violence and/or by putting the
victim in fear. (4) Murder and nonnegligent manslaughter is the willful
(non-negligent) killing of one human
being by another.

Twenty of the fifty states in the
United States were originally approached for information. Finally, we
were successful in obtaining monthly totals from sixteen locations, representing
most of the different geographical regions in the USA, for at least two consecutive years in the period 1975-79.
For California and Hawaii, statewide information was not available; hence, the
inclusion of three cities. Monthly totals
were obtained for the following locations and years: Alabama (1976, 1977),
Arizona (1977, 1978, 1979), Georgia
(1977, 1978), Honolulu (1976, 1977,
1978), Illinios (1975, 1976, 1977), Los
Angeles (1978, 1979), Maine (1976,
1977, 1978), New Mexico (1977, 1978),
North Carolina (1976, 1977), Oregon
(1977, 1978), Puerto Rico (1976, 1977,
1978), San Francisco (1977, 1978, 1979),
South Carolina (1975, 1976, 1977), Tennessee (1975, 1976, 1978, 1979), Texas

(1978, 1979) and Utah (1978, 1979).
There has been no selection of the data;
all those obtained have been reported.
It should be noted that some degree of
“noise” in the data resulted from (a) deficiencies in data collection (under- or
over-reporting of certain crimes), (b)
lack of standardization among different
locations, and (c) inclusion in the data of
assaults, robberies and murders committed by women as well as by men.

The population data used here to calculate crime rates were those of the 1970
Census of Population (Bureau of the
Census, Washington, D.C.). Mean latitude, which can be related to photoperiod by the use of the nautical almanac
(American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac, U.S. Government Printing
Office, 1979), was derived for each of
the twelve mainland states by halving
the difference between the northernmost and southernmost points of each
location. Mean monthly temperatures
(for the years for which crime data were
available) were obtained from the Local
Climatological Data Annual Summaries
(National Climatic Center, Asheville,
N.C.) for each of the three cities and for
one or two large cities near the center of
each state.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

The four types of violent crime were
analyzed separately for each of the sixteen locations using the cosinor method
(Halberg et al., 1967) for determining
the presence of statistically significant
annual rhythms. This method identifies
the best-fitting cosine function for the
data, examines whether there is a statistically significant rhythm, and calculates
the timing of the annual rhythmadjusted maximum (acrophase), mean
(mesor), and the magnitude of the
rhythm-adjusted maximum above the

mean (amplitude). For the purpose of
generating calendar dates, mean
monthly data were assumed to originate
from the middle of each month. The
computer program (Dixon, 1974) gave
information about several other parameters, including changes in the annual
means, amplitudes, and acrophases, but
these are not reported here. Monthly
temperature means were also analyzed
by the cosinor method for each of the
sixteen locations using the same computer program. The Spearman rank order correlation coefficient one-tailed,
using both raw data and those generated
by the cosine curves, was employed to
test the significance of relationships between different crimes of violence, latitude, and temperature. Certain relationships were further examined by
calculating regressions using the method
of least squares.

RESULTS

DATA FROM NINETEENTH CENTURY
EUROPE

Some examples of the data from
nineteenth-century criminal statistics
which led to the formulation of the
“thermic law of crime”’ are illustrated in
Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 gives the percentage changes about the annual mean
for two categories of crime against the
person (left panels) and for two categories of crime against property (right panels) listed in the “Statistics of the German Empire’’ as reported by
Aschaffenburg (1913). Data are from
the years 1883-92, and results are corrected for inequalities in the lengths of
different months.

Both assaults and rapes showed wellmarked annual rhythms. There were

Michael and Zumpe

gradual increases to peaks in July
(rapes) and August (assaults), which
were between 36 per cent (assaults) and
50 per cent (rapes) higher than the annual means, followed by a gradual decline to winter minima. In contrast,
fraud and petit larceny remained lower
than average throughout spring, summer, and autumn but rose to about 20
per cent above the annual mean between November and February. Not
only were the patterns for these latter
crimes less sinusoidal in shape and of
lower amplitude, but the annual peaks
occurred about 4-S months later than
those in assaults and rapes.

Figure 2 gives data for rapes during
1834-56 in England and during 1829-60
in France as reported by Lombroso
(1918), and for sexual crimes against
adults and against children in France
during 1827-69 as reported by Aschaffenburg (1913). Here a monthly mean
was expressed as a percentage of the annual total. In every case, there were
marked annual rhythms with maxima
between June-July. The annual rape
peak in England was rather lower
(about 25 per cent above average) than
sexual crime peaks in both France
(more than 50 per cent above average)
and Germany (Fig. 1).

Because these old data are not given
in a form suitable for rhythm analysis,
namely, as monthly totals for individual
years, it is not possible to evaluate probability levels. However, there can be little doubt that these highly consistent
seasonal rhythms in assaults, rapes, and
sexual crimes, with annual fluctuations
often in excess of 100 per cent, are statistically significant. It was therefore of
considerable interest to us to examine if
crimes of violence in the modern United
States showed any statistically significant annual rhythms, and to relate

winter months. Horizontal lines represent the annual means (i.e., 8.33%).

a significant F ratio for scatter indicated
that the cosine curve did not adequately
describe the data. This reduces the number of significant rhythms to 5 of 16 locations. The maxima in robberies occurred
between November and December.
The annual rhythm in murder was significant in only 1 of 16 locations. Thus,
in the majority of these locations in the
modern United States, there was a
much greater probability of aggravated
assaults and rapes occurring in the summer than in the winter, and this was dif
ferent from the situation for robbery
and murder.

Relationships Between the Different
Types of Violence

The rhythm-adjusted maxima for assaults and rapes generally occurred
within an eight-week period between
July 7 and September 8. Although it is
well-recognized that the occurrence of
rapes is frequently under-reported, it is
unlikely this would vary systematically

tended to peak within a seven-week period between November 2 and December 22, while maxima for murders were
scattered throughout the year. The close

in aggravated assaults and rapes became

correlation between the dates of the
maxima for assaults and rapes
(acrophases) (Spearman rank order correlation coefficient, r,=0.58, p <
0.025). Thus, in a location where assaults peaked earlier rather than later in
the summer, rapes were likely to do the
same; indeed, the maxima in assaults
preceded those in rapes in 11 of 16 locations (Table 1). There was also a positive correlation between the amplitudes
of the annual fluctuations in assaults and
rapes (7,=0.71, p < 0.005). Thus, the
greater the magnitude of the annual
change in assaults, the greater the magnitude of the annual change in rapes.
Because of the close temporal relationships between the maxima in assaults
and rapes, and in the magnitude of the
annual fluctuations, together with the
fact that rapes are invariably less numer
ous than assaults, we postulate that
rapes comprise a sub-population of assaultive behavior.

Relationships Between Human Violence
and Annual Temperature Rhythms

The summer maxima for assaults and
rapes suggested the possible influence of
exteroceptive factors, particularly because these characteristics were not
shared by the two other types of violence. Table 2 gives for each location the
annual mean temperature, the date of
the temperature maximum, and the percentage increase over the mean annual
temperature; again, these data are generated by the cosine functions. Annual
temperature rhythms were highly significant (p < 0.001) in all locations, and
there were positive associations between the annual temperature rhythms

and the annual assault and rape rhythms
but generally not between the annual
temperature rhythms and the robbery
and murder rhythms.

Using the raw data for each of the
twelve months of the year, we found
that correlation coefficients for monthly
mean temperatures and monthly mean
numbers of assaults were significant (r,
= 0.58 to 0.97, p < 0.05 to 0.0005) in all
locations except Honolulu and Puerto
Rico, as were those for monthly mean
temperatures and monthly mean numbers of rapes (r, = 0.64 to 0.97, p <
0.025 to 0.0005) in all locations except
Oregon, Puerto Rico, and San Francisco. In contrast, correlations between
temperature and robbery were significant only in Arizona, North Carolina,
and Oregon (7, = —0.58 to —0.72, p<
0.05 to 0.01), and those between tem
perature and murder were significant
only in Los Angeles, Puerto Rico, and
Texas (r, = 0.53 to 0.74 p < 0.05 to
0.01). Figure 4 gives representative data
from two locations, Tennessee and
South Carolina, showing the close relation between temperature and assault

There was a significant positive association across all sixteen locations between the dates of the temperature maxima and the dates of the assault maxima
(r, = 0.52, p < 0.02). For some reason,
Puerto Rico had an exceptionally early
acrophase for rape, preceding all the
others by more than 50 days (Table 1).
There were significant linear regressions
between temperature and assault amplitudes (slope + S.E. = 0.30 + 0.06, in

Fic. 4.—Annual changes in mean temperature and in four types of violent crime in two representative
© Jocations (Tennessee and South Carolina). Temperature changes were highly correlated with changes in
assaults and rapes (p < 0.0005) but not with robberies or murders (raw data).

tercept + S.E. = 3.75 + 2.01, p <
0.001) and between temperature and
rape amplitudes (slope + S.E. = 0.32 +
0.08, intercept + S.E. = 9.82 + 2.62, p
< 0.005) (Fig. 5). There were no similar
relations between temperature and robbery or murder. These associations appeared to indicate that the timing and
magnitude of the annual changes in as
 

saults and rapes in the modern United
States, but not those in robberies and
murders, are influenced by the annual
temperature rhythms (or the behavior
and temperature changes are influenced
by some common factor), since it would
be difficult to conceptualize a mechanism by which the behavioral changes
could influence temperature.

Fic. 5.—Linear regressions between the amplitudes of the annual temperature rhythms in the 16 locations and the amplitudes of the annual changes in each of the four types of human violence (all data derived from cosine functions). The highly significant slope for assault on temperature (0.30 + 0.06) was
almost identical to that for rape on temperature (0.32 + 0.08). Thus, locations with larger annual temperature changes have larger annual changes in assaults and rapes. There were no comparable associations

between temperature and either robbery or murder.

Relationships Between Human Violence
and Annual Mean Temperatures

If the close relationship between temperature and the number of assaults and
rapes was due simply to the fact that
higher temperatures permit a greater
degree of social interaction, it might be
expected that locations with higher
mean annual temperatures, such as Arizona, Honolulu, and Puerto Rico,
would have higher assault and rape rates
than locations with lower mean annual
temperatures, such as Illinois, Maine,

and Oregon. Inspection of Table 2,
which gives the mean numbers of crimes
per month per 100,000 population,
shows the absence of such associations.
There were no significant correlations
across the sixteen locations between annual mean temperatures and mean
crime rates, with the exception of a positive correlation between temperature
and murder rate (r, = 0.58, p < 0.025).
Thus, the old notion that human violence is more prevalent in hot climates
than in cooler ones was substantiated
only for murder, namely, the type of violence not showing a seasonal rhythm.

Relationships Between Human Violence
and Photoperiod

Because of its known influence on the
behavior of lower mammals, we were
especially interested in the possibility of
an effect of the photoperiod on human
behavior. Latitude determines the magnitude of the annual changes in photoperiod; a higher latitude is reflected in a

, larger amplitude in the annual rhythm.
= There were no significant associations
~~ between the mean latitudes of the differ© ent locations (Table 2) and the ampli® tudes of any of the four types of violence

DISCUSSION

The cosinor method of analysis has
not previously been applied to criminal
Statistics from a variety of different locations in the United States, although it
© has been used to demonstrate a signi= ficant annual rape rhythm in both Paris
— (France) and Houston (Texas) (Smo© lensky et al., 1981). The data reported
© here place on a firm statistical basis obé servational reports that certain forms of
8 human aggressive behavior increase in
& the summer months. Interestingly,
> these findings hold true only for assault
and rape and not for the other two types
of aggression for which we have meaningful data, namely, robbery and murder. The seasonal rhythms of assaults
and rapes were significantly related in
both timing and magnitude in different
locations, although in every case the
numbers of assaults far exceeded those
of rapes. Moreover, there have been almost identical annual increases in both
assaults and rapes in the United States

during the period 1960-68, whereas robberies and murders each showed a different rate of increase (Hyman and
Lanza, 1971). These various findings, although purely correlative, all support
the notion that rapes constitute a subpopulation of assaultive behavior, and it
follows that a deeper understanding of
the dynamics of rape will be found primarily in the mainsprings of human aggressive motivation.

The contrast between assault and
rape on the one hand and robbery and
murder on the other was a striking one,
remembering that robbery, although a
crime against property, involves violence towards a person. Assaults and
rapes peaked in the summer while robbery did so in the winter. Annual
rhythms for murder were virtually absent. It would be of interest to compare
these data with those from a country like
England where there is strict gun control
and murder rates are low. The finding of
significant and closely related annual
rhythms in assaults and rapes itself suggested the possibility that these two behaviors might be entrained by exteroceptive factors, whether these are
primarily cultural or primarily climatic.

A role for climate possesses appeal
because environmental stimuli are
known to influence the sexual and aggressive behavior of other primate species. Moreover, the fact that the amplitudes of the annual changes in assaults
and rapes in the modern United States
(15-20 per cent and 20-25 per cent increases above the annual means respectively) are smaller than those occurring
in nineteenth-century Europe (about 35
per cent and 50 per cent increases respectively) is quite compatible with recent technological developments that
have tended to minimize the influence
of season. The existence of a common

acrophase doe not, of course, imply any
causality.

No effect of photoperiod could be
demonstrated, but significant positive
correlations emerged between both the
timing and the magnitude of the annual
changes in temperature and those in assaults and rapes. These associations
held within the majonity of individual locations and also when comparisons were
made between locations. Thus, the relation between behavior and temperature
is on a rather firm basis. Since the
changes in photoperiod and temperature tend to covary, it is difficult to separate their effects, and the effect due to
temperature may have obscured that
due to photoperiod.

It is generally assumed that, as summer approaches, there are increased opportunities for social interactions and
that, as a consequence, crimes against
the person will inevitably increase. This
view received support from the fact that
assaults and rapes were maximal in the
summer months, but not from the finding that assault and rape rates, corrected
for population, showed no increases
with increasing annual mean temperatures as one proceeds south. In contrast,
murder exhibited no summer maxima,
yet murder rate was significantly and
positively corelated with annual mean
temperature, indicating that murders,
when corrected for population, tend to
be more frequent in warmer than in
colder climates. Human violence in the
modern United States does not therefore conform strictly to the ‘thermic law
of crime.”

Despite the profound technological,
demographic, religious, and economic
changes that have taken place since the
nineteenth-century in Europe, assaults
and rapes continue to show highly significant seasonal rhythms, from which
we adduce that the mechanisms respon

sible may depend as much on biological
factors as on social or cultural ones. This
hypothesis, namely, that exteroceptive
factors may act via neuroendocrine
pathways in the human to exert an influence on behavior is consistent with
their known role in socially-living nonhuman primates (Van Horn, 1980) that
show increased aggressivity at the start
of the mating season (Henzi and Lucas,
1980; Eaton et al., 1981; Michael and
Zumpe, 1981a, 1981). It is not necessary to make any assumptions about homologies between sexual aggression by
male monkeys and rape by men (they
are clearly different phenomena) in order to appreciate the relevance of comparative studies on the timing of longterm behavioral rhythms.

In several nonhuman primate species, the seasonal changes in behavior
are associated with increased testicular
size and elevated testosterone levels
(Coe and Rosenblum, 1978; Glick,
1979; Nigi et al., 1980), and evidence is
now accumulating for annual rhythms in
endocrine function and behavior in the
human. To our knowledge, the possibility of there being larger seasonal
changes in the plasma testosterone of violent and assaultive men has not as yet
been investigated. The data reported
here raise the fascinating possibility that
neuroendocrine mechanisms may play a
role in certain aspects of the social (and
anti-social) behavior of our own species.
