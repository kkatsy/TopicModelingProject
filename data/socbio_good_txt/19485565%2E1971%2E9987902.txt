TECHNIQUES OF SEX
PREDETERMINATION

The idea of sex predicting, and even sex
choosing, is not new. According to Gordon
(1958), an Egyptian papyrus written about.

 

4,000 years ago predicted that women with
greenish cast were certain to have boys. The
Hebrew Talmud went further. It forecast
that placing the marriage bed in a northsouth direction favored the conception of
boys.

Zirkle (1958) has outlined three ancient
theories of sex determination. The ancient
Hebrews believed that each testicle contained semen of one sex; the right testicle
contained male semen while the left one
contained female semen. A second prevailing
theory was that the sex of the offspring was
the same as the gender of the most “heavily
sexed parent.” A third theory advocated
that sex was determined by the direction of
wind at the time of coition. North wind
begot males; south wind begot females. According to Zirkle, this last theory faded out
in the seventeenth century.

Although techniques of sex predetermination have not yet been perfected, no major
biological or chemical breakthroughs are
necessary to implement the technology
needed for sex choosing. Etzioni (1968) predicted that the predetermination of sex is
five years away, while Taylor (1968) forecasted sex choosing sometime before 1975.

Kahn and Weiner (1967) stated that one of
the hundred technological innovations forecast for the next 33 years is the “capacity
to choose the sex of unborn children.”

There are two general strategies for
choosing the sex of unborn children. The
first is artificial insemination following the
separation of semen into X and Y sperm.
The second calls for selection against one
type of sperm within the reproductive tract
of the female after natural intercourse.

In the past several years there have been
many advances in techniques for separating
organic molecules, cellular components, and
cell types. Because X sperm are heavier than
Y sperm, the two can be separated by centrifuging at high speeds for short periods of
time. Using bull semen, Lindahl (1958) has
reported excellent separation of male sperm
(quantified by determining sex ratios after
artificial insemination). However, the X
sperm were apparently damaged by the high
gravitational forces generated. Nevertheless, in the ten years since this work, centrifugation techniques have been refined considerably and this method possibly holds
promise of success.

Even more promising is the separation of
semen in an electrical field (electrophoresis)
followed by artificial insemination. Using
rabbit semen, Gordon (1958) has reported
correctly predicting the sex of females in
71% of the cases, while prediction for males
was 64%. Human sperm can also be separated by this technique. To date, however,
no insemination has been tried with separated sperm, primarily because it has been
impossible to quantify the separation prior
to breeding. However, Barlow and Vosa
(1970) have developed a staining procedure
which differentiates between X and Y
sperm. According to Nature magazine’s
‘“‘News and Views” (1970, p. 897) “the technique will certainly afford a useful test of
success to those who are trying to separate
male and female determining sperm as a
means of sex control.”’ With some refine
Social Biology

ments, in vitro separation of semen followed
by artificial insemination seems to be the
most promising technique for actual use
in the near future.

Other scientists have opted for methods
which would avoid artificial insemination.
About thirty years ago, there was some excitement over the use of acid and alkaline
douches. Supposedly, an alkaline douche
after intercourse completely selected against
X sperm (Cook, 1941). However, other scientists were unable to duplicate these results.

There is one method of sex choosing
which enjoys some popularity today. Since
it is known that Y sperm swim faster than
X sperm, Shettles (1961) has postulated a
method of sex choosing based on the rhythm
technique. If intercourse occurs shortly after
ovulation (when the egg is high in the FalJopian tube) there will be a greater chance
that fertilization will be by a Y sperm. Although the reliability of this technique is
questionable, a new drug, Estrindex (Tara
Industries, Inc.), is now being marketed
with the specific intent of facilitating sex
preselection.

It seems probable, however, that the
technology of sex choosing will be refined
within afew years. Assuming that this innovation were adopted, what kind of demographic and social psychological implications would this technology have on human
populations?

EARLIER FINDINGS ON SEX PREFERENCES
AND THEIR IMPACT ON FERTILITY

There are two levels of analysis which
yield markedly different perspectives. At
the macro-analytic level, the world population explosion has already challenged the
“how many” question. The “what kind”
question is more complex and certainly less
important at this point in history. However,
many scientists, as well as laymen, in the
absence of empirical data, are alarmed at
the possible consequences of sex predeterVol. 18, No. 1

mination. As the journal Sctence (1957, p.
1059) stated in an editorial:
The obvious problems that are likely to arise
if successful control of human sex determination becomes practicable... makes one
wonder whether human beings have yet

acquired the wisdom to make use of such
wide powers.

While such macroscopic problems are of
ultimate importance, this study was designed to analyze some possible problems on
the more immediate microscopic level. With

= the individual or family as a focal point, sex
N predetermination for some would have a
6 strong positive effect. People could control
E a critical variable in their family planning
2 or correct previous sex imbalances in their
6 family. However, for many others, the avail+ ability of sex predetermination techniques
<, could be a mixed blessing. As Michelmore
= (1968, p. 412) stated:

Many scientists think the day is not far off
when parents will be able to choose the sex of
their children. It will be interesting to see
what effects this has on the population.
There are already millions of people quite
incapable of making a decision. How will
this vast army of ‘‘don’t knows” react when
faced with so important a choice?

From a demographic point of view, sex
~ predetermination could influence three im& portant population variables: first-child patS terns, sex ratio, and family size. If sex choosSing becomes a reality, the relative social
E values of bearing male or female children
A would be critical. Ideal family sex ratios
would become real sex ratios. As William
Graham Sumner (1906, p. 312) said:

Tn all variations of the life conditions, in all
forms of industrial organization and at all
stages of the arts, conjunctures arise in
which the value of children fluctuates and
also the relative value of boys and girls turns
in favor, now of one, now of the other.

There are data to suggest that Sumner’s
statement could be more specific today.
May and Heer (1968) cite evidence which
shows that, in India, parents would rather
bear male than female children. Williamson

 

 

Sex Predetermination 5

(unpublished) demonstrated that there is a
preference for male babies in many diverse
cultures around the world.

In the United States, Dinitz, Dynes, and
Clarke (1964) asked unmarried college students to indicate their sex preferences for
their future children. The results were striking. When confronted with the hypothetical
possibility of having only one child, 91%
of the males and 66% of the females wanted
a boy. Concerning the first child of the family, men and women chose similarly: 60%
wanted a boy; 5% chose a girl; and 34% expressed no preference (a choice not available
for the first question). When religion was
controlled, Catholics and Jews chose boys
overwhelmingly, while Protestants favored
boys somewhat less.

Winston (1932) studied 55 upper-class
students, recording anonymously their desire for marriage and children. In total, the
students wanted 86 boys and 52 girls, a
65% greater demand for males over females. Other studies (Clare and Kiser, 1951;
Freedman, Freedman, and Whelpton, 1960)
showed a similar preference for male children.

There is good evidence that the preference for male children is more than ideal.
Winston (1932) studied 5,466 high-income
completed families and found that there
were 8,329 males born alive as compared to
7,434 females, which gave a sex ratio at
birth of 112.0 (compared to the national
average which was 105.6). The sex ratio of
the last child born to these families was
117.4; that is, significantly more families
stopped having children after they had a
boy than after they had a girl. Westoff et al.
(1961) found that when the first child was
a boy the interval before a second child was
conceived averaged three months longer
than when the first child was a girl. In other
words, people already make crude efforts to
determine the sex composition of their
families.

Etzioni (1968), summarizing the demo

76 Markle and Nam

graphic implications of sex predetermination, predicted that such a technology would
result in a 7% increase in male children in
the United States. Implicit in this forecast
are two assumptions: that, in time, sex
choosing would be adopted by virtually
everyone and that people would choose the
sex according to past indications.

Along with the desire to have more boys
than girls, there is the concomitant wish to
have at least one of each sex in completed
families. This line of reasoning has led investigators to postulate that sex predetermination would result in smaller families
(Pohlman, 1968). Clare and Kiser (1951)
and Westoff, Potter, and Sagi (1963) stated
that preference regarding the sex of children
affects the size of a family, but is not a major
determinant of family size. If couples fail to
achieve the desired sex composition of their
families, there is pressure to have another
child with the hope of obtaining a proper
sex ratio. Using a national probability sample of white females in childbearing years,
Freedman (1960) stated:

Preference for at least one child of each sex
has a minor but significant influence in
determining whether couples with 2, 3, or 4
children expect to have an additional child.
This relationship was found to persist with a
number of socioeconomic and demographic
controls.

To summarize, it seems evident that the
technology of sex predetermination has sufficient implications in many areas of demography to merit study. As Meier (1968), discussing sex choosing, stated:

At this stage of the study, the investigator ...
must find means for detecting new storm
centers of potential change while they are
still on the distant horizon. He must interpret what impact they are likely to have
upon territories in which a population problem exists.

For these reasons, the authors decided to
undertake a study which would throw more
light on public attitudes toward sex predetermination and on the likely choices re
Social Biology

garding the sex of children in the event that
control of the process were possible.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A questionnaire was constructed which
included items relevant to the several concerns of the study. These items covered the
demographic and social characteristics of
the respondent, his views on ideal family
size and desired sex composition, his opinlons about heart transplants and birth control, his knowledge of developments concerning the process of sex predetermination,
and his attitudes about sex predetermination and the conditions under which they
might change.

Some 438 questionnaires were distributed
to groups of students at Florida State University, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, and Tallahassee Junior College. Of the total sample, 283 (64%) were
returned. In addition to the high rate of
nonresponse, the sample of students was
heavily biased toward social science majors
and slightly biased toward females. Generalizations to the broader population are not
warranted, but many of the findings are so
clear-cut as to permit tentative generalizations. Moreover, there are two characteristics of this sample which make it worthy of
study. Most of these students will be married in a few years, if they are not married
already. The technology of sex predetermination is estimated by many to be three to
five years in the future. Thus, a considerable
portion of this sample will be planning their
families when sex predetermination will
probably be a real option to them. Also, the
educated community may act as opinionmakers and wield influence beyond their
numbers in determining whether sex-choosing will be adopted by the general population.

RESULTS

As stated previously, sex predetermination, in its initial stages, will call for rather

Ninety-seven per cent of the sample believed

that married people should be allowed to

restrict people to the rhythm method, and

1% were opposed to married couples using

any form of birth control. For themselves,

mination, but the uniqueness of this particular innovation could possibly create a different set of attitudes among the public.

There is a consensus among most scientists that the adoption of sex-choosing by
the general population would lead to an excess of male infants. With the exception of
the study by Dinitz et al. (1964), all previous predictions were based on direct evidence. In this study, respondents were
asked: “Ideally, how many children of each
sex would you like to have?” The data show
that this sample wanted 485 (55.4%) males
and 390 (44.6%) females. This would result
in a sex ratio of 122 males for every 100 females if ideal family size could be converted
into actual family size.

Logically extending the analysis, it was
then determined in what order, according
to sex, the sample wanted their future children, Table 1 makes it quite clear that especially for their first child this population
preferred male over female children.

Both men and women overwhelmingly
would like their first child to be a boy. Regardless of their ideal family size, fully 80%
of the men desired a first boy, while only 4%
wanted a girl, and 16% listed no preference;
79% of the women wanted a male child
first, 12% wanted a girl, and only 9% listed
no preference. After the first child, 60% of
all respondents wanted a girl for their second
child. When ideal family size was held constant, of those respondents wanting only
two children, 76% chose a boy for their first

child and then 74% listed a girl for their
second child.

For those wanting additional children,
48% desired a boy for their third child, and
53% wanted a boy for their fourth child.
As Table 1 indicates, the percentage of those
respondents indicating no preference became
larger with each additional child. Thus, for
larger families, the pattern of beginning with
a boy and then alternating sex still exists,
although somewhat weakened.

It was necessary to establish whether the
subject material of this investigation was
salient to the respondent. The data show
that about two-thirds of the women and
one-half of the males in this sample have devoted frequent thought to their future family size. However, all studies of the future
are fraught with one danger—that due to its
remoteness people have never been exposed
to the ideas concerning the research topic.
When this sample was asked: “Have you
ever heard of sex predetermination of children before?’”’, 76% responded “yes.” Of
those who listed ‘“‘yes,’’ 60% said that their
source of knowledge was the mass media,
while 26% listed school sources (professor,
textbooks, etc.), and 14% listed personal
sources (parents, friends, etc.).

We are not convinced that three-quarters
of these students have indeed heard of sex
predetermination, as the data would indicate. Many of their sources were vague;
70% who listed mass media could not give
the specific source of their information. Further, many listed sources which, to our
knowledge, have never published material
in this area.

Implicit in Etzioni’s (1968) analysis of
sex predetermination was the assumption
that there would be little or no resistance to
its adoption by the general population.
Table 2 shows that 26% of the sample would
like to choose the sex of their future children,
while 33% are undecided or have no preference, and 40% are opposed to the idea.

We also asked our sample if they would

Social Biology

favor allowing others to predetermine the
sex of future children. Under these circumstances, 40% would permit sex choosing by
others, while 36% were undecided or had no
preference, and only 18% were opposed.

Attitudes toward sex predetermination
were unrelated to father’s occupation and
father’s and mother’s education. However,
many independent variables did have a patterned influence on sex-choosing attitudes,
as shown in Table 2.

These data show that as class rank and
ageincreased sex-predetermination attitudes
became more favorable. Black and male respondents favored sex-choosing more than
white female respondents.

People who are, or have been, married
(“ever married”) favored sex predetermination much more than people who had
never been married. Possibly, the problems
of family planning were much more relevant
to this group of people. The data show that
matried people had more frequent thought
about their ideal family size (70% to 58%
for nonmarried people); married people also
wanted smaller families than did single people (3.05 to 3.30 children).

The relationship between sex-choosing
attitudes and religious preferences is also
shown in Table 2. The data show that there
was almost no variation among various
Protestant groups. Those who listed no religion had, as a group, the most favorable
attitudes towards sex predetermination. On
the other hand, Catholics were most opposed
to that innovation.

There was a complex interrelationship between people’s attitudes and what they perceived to be the attitudes of their churches
toward a given subject. No religious institution has commented on the future possibility
of sex predetermination; yet, of those people
with church affiliations, 64% perceived that
their church would take a specific stand on
this issue. Table 3 deals with the respondent’s perception of his church’s attitudes
toward sex choosing.

Those who listed no religion, had no perception of what their church thinks, or did
not care what their church thinks of sex
predetermination were more likely to be in
favor of sex choosing than groups which had
other religious perceptions.

It has been postulated that sex predetermination could decrease actual family size
by allowing people to achieve the sex composition of their ideal family. Table 4 shows
the relationship between sex-choosing attitudes and ideal family size.

Those who favored sex predetermination
would like, on the average, 0.75 less children
than those who were opposed to that innovation, Table 4 shows that such families desired 0.45 less boys and 0.17 less girls. The
idea implied from these data, that sexchoosing could possibly lower the birth rate,
will be developed in the discussion at the
end of this paper.

It has been stated previously that the

Social Biology

whole concept of attitude toward a future
technology is rather tenuous. It should be
expected that people’s attitudes toward sex
predetermination are quite fluid at this point
in history. This study was designed to test
the firmness of people’s attitudes toward
sex-choosing by presenting conditions which
might make the alternative choice more or
less attractive.

Presumably, if people have all children
of one sex, they might turn to sex predetermination to assure them a balanced family.
On the other hand, the medical techniques
‘by which sex-choosing might be accomplished were never made explicit in this
questionnaire. How would those already
committed to sex predetermination react to
accomplishing that act by use of artificial
insemination with the husband’s sperm or
the use of a prescription pill? Table 5 examines the pattern of opinion shifts upon
the addition of extenuating circumstances.

DISCUSSION

esily of Michi

The adoption, even to a limited extent,
of sex-predetermination techniques would
g have obvious implications for many areas
~ of demography. Three consequences will be
Zz emphasized here: first-child patterns, sex
_'§ ratio, and the birth rate.

The data from this study and from Dinitz

"e et al. (1964) support the contention that
5 most people would like their first child to be
a male. The sample for both studies was
college students. However, other indirect
evidence (Williamson, unpublished) suggests that the first male preference is quite
general, if not a universal phenomenon. In
this study, people listed three broad categories of reasons for wanting a first-born
male: “carry on the family name,” “girls are
harder to raise,” “a girl should have an
older brother.” In a more comprehensive
study, these reasons for wanting a first-born
male could be further studied and analyzed.

stated that sex choosing could cause a serious imbalance in the sex ratio. There are
two implicit assumptions in his work: that
everyone would adopt this innovation and
that they would choose the sex of their future children according to past indications.
Further, these patterns of sex predetermination would not only operate in the near
future, but also would remain unchanged in
the foreseeable future.

Concerning the first assumption, these
data indicated that a sizeable percentage of
people would initially take advantage of
sex-predetermination techniques. Etzioni’s
second assumption is impossible to test a priori. However, in this study, respondents
were quite specific about the order, according to sex, of their future family. Less than
25% of the sample checked “no preference”’
in choosing the sex composition they desired, and only 15% expressed no sex preference for their first two children.

But there are no data anywhere which
would suggest if or how people would adjust
their actual or ideal family if there were an
excess of male children. These data only
project into the near future and suggest that
if sex-choosing were adopted there would be
an excess of male children.

It is well known that there is already an
excess of male babies at birth. A count of
live births shows that 105 males are born for
every 100 females. Thus, it might be stated
that the desire for excess male children is
merely a reflection of infant mortality rates
and that, in fact, people want balanced
families. This idea may be refuted for two
reasons, There is no evidence that people
plan the sex composition of their families
taking into account the infant mortality
rates of the sexes; rather, it is more probable
that respondents were thinking of grown
children, not infants, in their ideal family.
Secondly, even if male mortality were an
important factor in family planning, the sex
ratio at birth would account for little of the
proposed excess males in ideal families.

These data show that if sex choosing were
adopted, initially 122 males would be born
for every 100 females.

It has been postulated that sex choosing,
if adopted, would lower the birth rate.
Westoff et al. (1963, p. 207) stated that ‘‘sex
preference operates to affect family size if
the desired sex expectation is not readily
achieved.” According to May and Heer
(1968, p. 208), ‘‘the prerequisite for a solution of the population problem in India is
reduction of the family size required to assure son survivorship.” Here the technique
of sex predetermination could possibly help
to reduce family size by giving people the
power to have the appropriate number of
sons, but not necessarily daughters, to meet
their desires.

These data showed a strong relationship
between small family size and favorable
attitudes toward sex predetermination. Theoretically, there is a problem, since discussions of both ideal family size and sexchoosing attitudes are discussions of future

situations; causal relationships between the
two variables are probably not easily visualized. What these data suggested, but did not
establish, was that people favor sex choosing
so that they may have smaller families.

The authors are now planning a more
comprehensive study of probable patterns
of sex predetermination and their possible
consequences for population size and structure. The larger study will survey a representative sample of the population 18 to 39
years old in one city in Florida. The resulting information should provide a sounder
basis for gauging the demographic consequences of an imminent but largely ignored
medical development that promises to have
a substantial impact on international childbearing patterns.
