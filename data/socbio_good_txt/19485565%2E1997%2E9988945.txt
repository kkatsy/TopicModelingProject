ABSTRACT: This study describes patterns of sex differentials in perinatal mortality in China and
Finland. The analysis is based on three population-based one-year birth cohorts, one from Qing
- dao, China, in 1992 and two from Northern Finland in 1966 and 1985-86, comprised of 9,219,

11,422 and 9,207 singletons with at least 28 gestational weeks and 1000 g in birthweight, respectively. Both Finnish cohorts had an excess of male over female perinatal deaths, but in the Chinese cohort girls were more likely to die than boys. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of perinatal
mortality for boys was 1.31 (95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 0.98, 1.78) and 1.57 (95 per cent
CI 0.89, 2.78) in the Finnish 1966 and 1985-86 cohorts, respectively, and 0.82 (95 per cent CI
0.55, 1.20) in the Chinese cohort. The corresponding figure for stillbirths in the Chinese was 0.57
(95 per cent CI 0.33, 0.98), which could explain the total excess of female deaths during the perinatal period. Our results suggest that the role of different social and cultural environments on the

existing sex differentials in perinatal mortality between the countries needs further evaluation.

Higher infant and childhood mortality in
boys than in girls is observed in almost all
of the developed countries (United Nations,
1993), whereas in some of the developing
countries, e.g., Jordan and Syria, girls suffer
higher risk of death (Rutstein, 1984). However, there is little data available to compare
sex differences in perinatal mortality, 1.e.,
stillbirth and neonatal mortality analyzed
separately, of the developed and developing
societies. Finland is a developed country
with high-quality maternal and child health
care and low perinatal and infant mortality,
while China is the largest developing country in the world. The current study aims to
compare the patterns of sex differentials in
perinatal mortality in Finland and China.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
‘COHORTS

The study was conducted on three
population-based birth cohorts, two from

Northern Finland for 1966 and _ for
1985-86, and one from Qingdao, China,
for 1992. The two birth cohorts in Norther Finland consist of 12,231 and 9,479
births, respectively, comprising 96 per
cent and 99 per cent of all births in the
provinces of Oulu and Lapland with an
expected birth date falling between January 1 and December 31 in the former,
and between July 1, 1985 and June 30,
1986 in the latter (Rantakallio, 1969;
Rantakallio and Oja, 1990). In the Chinese cohort the data are from the birth
records of the Qingdao Health Center for
Women and Children, which routinely
collects records from all 18 hospitals with
delivery rooms distributed over the urban
area (Xu, 1995). There were 9,391 births
altogether in the data set, which account
for about 98 per cent of all births in the
city in 1992.

The data on deaths in the Finnish cohort were obtained by linking the files
of Statistics Finland (Rantakallio, 1986).

The basic data on deaths in the Chinese
cohort came from the Qingdao Health
Center. Furthermore, investigators in
China visited all the hospitals and local
family planning organizations in the affiliated area to ensure high quality of the
data on deaths (Xu, 1995). This procedure enabled those deaths that belonged
to the cohort but had failed to be registered by the hospitals or had occurred at
home to be retrieved.

Cases of missing information on gestational age and birthweight were excluded. For the purpose of comparison
between the countries, the present work
was limited to singletons with at least 28
weeks completed gestation and a birthweight of at least 1000 g in all three cohorts (Lawson and Mayberry, 1994). The
numbers of births included in this analysis were thus 11,422 and 9,207 in the two
Finnish cohorts and 9,219 in the Chinese
cohort.

METHODS

The following definitions were employed, following WHO recommendations (WHO, 1975): (1) A stillbirth is a

fetal death after 28 completed weeks of

gestation. Stillbirth rate is the number of
stillbirths per 1,000 live and still births.
(2) An early neonatal mortality rate is the
number of deaths during the first 7 days
of life per 1,000 live births. (3) A perinatal mortality rate is the number of stillbirths and deaths in the first week of life
per 1,000 live and still births.

Since the distribution of birthweights
varies between populations, birthweights
were standardized by adjusting them to a
relative scale based on the underlying
Gaussian distributions of weight for each
population-specific group (Wilcox, 1993;
Rooth, 1980). With this adjustment, birth
Perinatal Mortality 171

weight within each group is expressed as
a z score, i.e., the unit of standard deviation from the mean. As the birthweight
distributions vary between boys and girls
as well, the same method was extended to
the sexes in this analysis, resulting in sexpopulation-specific groups. Such an approach allows the comparison of mortality among such groups with the same
relative rather than absolute birthweight.
Low birthweight was defined as 2 standard deviations (2 SD) below the mean
for each sex-population group, as suggested by Rooth (Rooth, 1980). The gestational age used in the analysis was calculated as the interval between the first
day of the last menstrual period and the
day of delivery.

Information on maternal occupation
and education were available for 5,280
singletons in the Chinese cohort, i.e., for
mothers living in three of the five districts,
Taidong, Cifang, and Cangkou. The maternal occupations were grouped, according to the Chinese classification custom,
in terms of the cadre stratum, including
various grades of managers in government
organizations and state-owned businesses,
doctors, lawyers, teachers, and most other
occupations requiring a higher level of
education and special professionals, and
the worker stratum, including servants,
workers, the self-employed, a few farmers, the unemployed and all others without cadre status. Maternal education was
originally recorded on a scale of illiterate,
elementary school, secondary school, and
college (including postgraduate), which
was transformed into the terms of the current Chinese educational system, implying a duration of schooling of = 6, 7-12
and = 13 years. In the Finnish cohort,
maternal occupation was categorized into
three groups: professionals, skilled persons (including farmers), and unskilled

workers. Maternal education was recorded
the same way as the Chinese.

The crude OR in perinatal mortality
for boys in each cohort (taking girls as
the reference group) was calculated and
adjusted for birthweight, gestational age,
and maternal age by logistic regression
analysis.

RESULTS

Table 1 presents the distributions of
the newborns by maternal age, gestational age, sex, birthweight, and perinatal
mortality. Teenage mothers were rare in
the Chinese cohort, and only about 10 per
cent of the mothers were over thirty, almost 90 per cent being in their twenties.
In the Finnish cohorts, the proportions of
mothers under 19 years were 7.2 per cent
and 4.3 per cent in the 1966 cohort and
1985-86 cohort, respectively, and that of
mothers over 30 was three times higher
than the Chinese figure in both Finnish
cohorts. The sex ratio of boys to girls at
birth was as high as 111.5 in the Chinese
cohort, compared with two consistent results of 105.5 in the Finnish cohorts
(Table 1). The sex-specific proportions of
preterm births (<37 weeks) and low birthweight (<—2 SD) were greatest in the
1966 Finnish cohort and lowest in the
Chinese cohort. Overall perinatal mortality and both boy- and girl-specific mortality were almost three times higher in the
Finnish 1966 cohort than in the Finnish
1985-86 cohort, while mortality rates in
the Chinese cohort were between these
two (see Tables 2, 3, and 4).

confidence intervals (CI) for boys in perinatal mortality and its components, 1.e.,

gestational age (as a continuous variable
and its quadratic), birthweight (<—2 SD
and =—2 SD), and maternal age (as a
continuous variable), are shown for the
three cohorts in Table 5. The OR’s for
early neonatal mortality are over one in
the Chinese cohort, and those for stillbirths are clearly less than one. In both
Finnish cohorts boys showed a higher risk
of death than girls in each component of
mortality. No significant interaction terms
between sex and gestational age, birthweight, or maternal age were found in any
of the multiple logistic models.

Differences in perinatal mortality between boys and girls by mothers’ occupation are presented for the subset of 5,280
singletons in the Chinese cohort (Table 6).
Lower perinatal mortality was found in the
cadre stratum than in the worker stratum
among both boys and girls. As only four
perinatal deaths were observed in the cadre
stratum, no reliable conclusions could be
drawn on the disparity in sex differentials
in perinatal mortality between the two social strata. Maternal education failed to
provide any further information for comparison purposes due to the small number
in the group of = 12 years. Boys of skilled
workers had a significantly higher risk of
death than girls in both Finnish cohorts, but
the association disappeared after controlling for maternal smoking. Maternal education had no association with sex differentials in perinatal mortality.

DISCUSSION

China has achieved a substantia] reduction in infant mortality during recent
decades as compared with other developing countries (Chalmers, 1980; Grant,
1992). The decline in infant mortality in
China, however, has been uneven between

the sexes, i.e., the extent of the reduction
has been greater in boys than in girls (Xu
et al., 1994). Data also suggest that Chinese have achieved reasonably low perinatal mortality rates as well (Fung et al.,
1989). Our data show that perinatal mortality is 13.0 per 1,000 for singletons with
28 weeks completed gestation and a birthweight of at least 1000 g, and that the risk
of mortality among boys is about 80 per
cent of that among girls. Among stillbirths, boys suffer only a half of the risk
as that of girls. The excess female perinatal mortality could be explained entirely
by the excess risk of stillbirth among fe
male fetuses. Neither birthweight nor gestational age, commonly recognized as the
two most important determinants of perinatal death, nor maternal age appeared to
have any substantial influence on the observed sex differentials.

Data from the China In-depth Fertility
Survey—Phase II (IDFS) conducted in five
provinces and one city in China in 1987
show that the preference for sons over
daughters is a popular social and cultural
phenomenon in China (State Statistical
Bureau, 1989). Ultrasound operated by
skilled technicians is now available in

in companies’ health clinics. This easy
access to ultrasound determinations of
sex makes it possible for couples who
have a strong desire for a boy rather than
a girl to make their choice by determining the sex of the fetus before birth, although this is not allowed by the health
authorities. According to the IDFS, the illiterate, the less educated, and the farmers and workers show stronger preferences for boys than others. Our results
indicate that the worker stratum not only

had a higher perinatal mortality for both
boys and girls than did the cadre stratum
but also had a greater excess risk of death
for girls, even though the result is not statistically significant because of the small
number of deaths reported in the cadre
stratum. The new law on maternal and infant health in China that has been effective since June 1, 1995, strictly prohibits
prenatal identification of the sex of the
fetus except when “necessary on medical
grounds,” and it is expected that this re

"SEX is defined as 0 if girls and 1 if boys; AGE (maternal age, as a covariate); LBW (low birthweight) is defined as 0 if =—2SD and ]
<2—SD; GW-SQ (quadratic term of gestational age, as a covariate); GW (gestational age, as a covariate).


Liang, 1984) and elsewhere, such as Singapore (Hughes, 1985), Hong Kong (Fung
et al., 1989), the United States (Wang et
al., 1994) and Canada (Wen et al., 1995).
It is beyond the scope of the current study
to explore possible explanations for the
observed phenomenon.

In conclusion, the patterns of sex differentials in perinatal mortality between
China and Finland run in opposite directions. Chinese girls experience an excess
risk of perinatal death as compared with

boys, especially for stillbirths. In both
Finnish cohorts boys are more likely to
die than girls. Our results encourage further evaluation of the role of social and
economic environments on the existing
sex differentials in perinatal mortality between the two countries.

“The mothers’ occupations were recorded according to the Chinese classification in terms of “cadre” strata (including various grades of
managers in government organizations and state-owned businesses, doctors, lawyers, teachers, and most other occupations requiring a higher
level of education and special professions) and “worker” strata {including servants, workers, the self-employed, a few farmers, the unemployed
and all others without cadre status).
