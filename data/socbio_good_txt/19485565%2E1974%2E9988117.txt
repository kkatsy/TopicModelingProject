Geographic Distribution of Hereditary

Myopathies in Northeast Italy

In recent years, a large number of
studies have been carried out on muscular
dystrophy, particularly on early diagnosis
and on detection of genetic carriers (for
example, see Smith et al., 1966; Walton
et al., 1967; Thompson et al., 1967). However, there have been surprisingly few
epidemiological studies.

Data concerning prevalence rates of different types of myopathies in human populations were reported in Britain (Walton
and Nattras, 1954), in two regions of the
United States (Herndon, 1954; Kurland,
1958), and in Japan (Kuroiwa and Miyazaki, 1967). However, none of these studies
gives the precise geographical distribution
of the different types of muscular dystrophy,
although this information might prove useful in evaluating the effects of environment
on their prevalence.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The reported cases were obtained from
a general survey of hospital records over
a twelve-year period in the following regions of Italy: Veneto, Trentino-Alto
Adige, and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. The area
considered is the northeastern part of
Italy, of which the natural borders are the
Alps in the north, the Adriatic Sea in the

east, Garda Lake in the west, and the Po
River in the south. We have assumed that
practically all the patients afflicted with
one of these disabling diseases would have
received hospital attention at least once in
their lifetimes.

The total number of hospital records
examined was about 250,000. The original
diagnoses were reviewed, and all dubious
cases as well as records with insufficient
clinical information were discarded. To
exclude possible interference due to the
contribution of non-native individuals, patients with nonregional surnames were not
included in the study.

Each case was recorded separately in a
Statistic file; clinical findings as well as
personal and family data were recorded.
The pedigree of familiar cases was traced.

Our interest was concentrated on five
different types of myopathy, the genetics
of which are clearly defined; X-linked recessive muscular dystrophy (Duchenne),
autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy
(Duchenne-like), autosomal recessive limbgirdle muscular dystrophy, autosomal
dominant facio-scapulo-humeral dystrophy,
and autosomal dominant dystrophia myotonica. For the classification of types of
progressive muscular dystrophy, the cri
235

236

teria suggested by Walton and GardnerMedwin (1968) were followed. According
to these criteria, X-linked muscular dystrophy includes both the severe Duchenne
type and the clinically milder Becker type
(Becker and Keiner, 1955; Becker, 1957,
1962). The autosomal recessive type
(Duchenne-like) was separated because
of its different pattern of inheritance
(Kloepfer and Talley, 1958).

The prevalence rate for each type of
muscular dystrophy was calculated as the
number of cases found in the survey period (12 years) over the total population
of the area. A similar method was used by
Kuroiwa and Miyazaki (1967) for estimating the prevalence rate of Fukuoka
City, Japan.

The statistical data referring to the
whole population were obtained from the
Annuario Generale dei Comuni d'Italia,
1969. Additional information on the statistical parameters of the population (i.e.,
occupations, internal mobility, marriages,
etc.) were obtained from the Annali di
Statistica, 1968.

RESULTS

The overall prevalence of myopathies
is slightly higher than that obtained in previous surveys (Table 1); the relative proportion of cases shows that 46 per cent of
the cases are X-linked Duchenne, while
35 per cent are autosomal recessive limbgirdle. On the basis of the pedigree analysis, familiar cases of Duchenne muscular
dystrophy account for about 25 per cent
of the total.

There are differences in the prevalence
of different types of muscular dystrophy
in different districts and regions as well as
differences in the relative proportion of
cases (Table 2 and Figure 1). It is possible
that some of these differences are due to
one or more large families in an area having a number of afflicted individuals. This
is true for facio-scapulo-humeral muscular
dystrophy in the Rovigo district, where
the very prevalence rate (4.37 X 10-5) is
easily explained by the dominance of the
character, expressed in several members of
the same affected family. It is also true for

myotonic dystrophy cases in the neighborhood of Padova and Udine.

Additionally, small differences between
districts could be explained on the basis
of a multigenerational drift, but this is
not the case for differences between regions. In fact, there is a significant difference in the prevalence rate for the
limb-girdle type between Veneto (1.70 X
10-5) and Friuli-Venezia Giulia (2.81
< 10-5).

type is more frequent; in a third area,
limited to the district of Rovigo, the facioscapulo-humeral type accounts for a very
large number of cases.

In addition, the distribution of cases
over the surveyed area seems to correlate
with the geographic characteristics of the
territory, the limb-girdle type being much
more frequent in northern and mountain
districts. Table 3 summarizes the results

and limb-girdle). When the data are
grouped following the scheme of districts
belonging to the same administrative unit,
the chi-square value is at the border of
significance. However, when the data are
grouped according to the geographic characteristic of the districts, the differences
become much more significant (P = 0.05
— 0.02).

DISCUSSION

The results obtained in this survey indicate: (a) a rather high prevalence of
muscular dystrophy and, in particular,
Duchenne cases; (0) a nonhomogeneous
distribution of cases, with a higher prevalence of limb-girdle cases in mountain
districts. The reliability of the data is supported both by the large number of cases
(366) and by the total prevalence value
(5.42 for 100,000 inhabitants), comparable
with data in the literature.

The rather high prevalence observed for
Duchenne cases has received an indirect
support from the findings of Lawrence et
al. (1973) among Italian immigrants in

 

Australia. The muscular dystrophy incidence among Italians appears to be higher
than among other ethnic groups.

As for the geographic distribution, an
analysis must take into account different
factors—ethnic, historical, geographical, or
socioeconomic—which could play a role in
establishing and maintaining differential
gene distributions in the regions surveyed.

ETHNOLOGICAL FACTORS

The native population of the area considered in our survey is not homogeneous
from the anthropological point of view.
The early existence of three main groups
(Northerners, Mediterraneans, and Adriatics) is well known. Cultural and linguistic
differences between different districts still
persist, but these different “cultures” do
not overlap exactly with the original
groups mentioned above.

HISTORICAL FACTORS

The original populations received genetic
contributions by invasions and immigrations of northern and northeastern populations in the centuries before the rise of

240

the Republic of Venice (fourteenth century). From 1797-1860, another small
immigration took place during the Austrian
occupation of the region. However, it is
relevant to point out that apart from this
immigration in the last century, the population has not undergone relevant genetic
changes.

GEOGRAPHICAL FACTORS

The three regions considered in the survey are subdivided into 13 districts. Four
of them are mostly mountainous districts,
and five are partially hilly. All nine were
rather isolated in the past by the lack
of good roads. The remaining four plain
districts are crossed by several important
rivers which in the past constituted strong
natural barriers. This situation was probably responsible, at least in part, for the
isolation of several “genetic islands” in
the area.

SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS

For centuries, the economy of the region
was based mainly upon agriculture. The
level of urbanization is still rather low.
The distribution of town sizes shows a
maximum of towns with one- to five-hundred inhabitants.

Until now, the area has been unable to
attract immigrants from other regions. The
available data on internal migration shows
also that the internal mobility of the population is relatively low. Regarding choice
of marriage partner, the statistical data
available indicate that 92 per cent of people in Friuli-Venezia Giulia married people
from the same region. A strong family organization contributes to the transmission
and preservation of traditional customs,
particularly in the choice of a marriage
partner. We believe that all of these factors have contributed to the formation and
consequent stabilization of several micro

populations, characterized by a rather high
level of endogamy.

A preliminary study of ABO blood group
distribution, made on a random sample of
8,657 blood donors in the district of
Vicenza, showed the existence of at least
two definite genetic islands, each homogeneous within itself, but with strong heterogeneity between them with regard to
the A/O ratio.

The differences in the prevalence of
particular types of muscular dystrophy and
the differences in the proportions of the
various types in different districts indicate
that three geographic areas can be identified. In northern districts, the limb-girdle
type shows a very high level of morbidity.
In the south-central districts of Padova,
Vicenza, and Verona, the Duchenne type
is clearly predominant. In the most southern district, there is a very high prevalence of facio-scapulo-humeral dystrophy.

As a whole, this distribution suggests
the coexistence of at least two different
populations in the same area. However, no
data have been reported on differential
distribution of alleles for muscular dystrophy among other human populations;
on the contrary, in spite of various ethnic
differences, the incidence of muscular dystrophy in Japanese populations was found
to be similar to the Western one.

We think that the high rate of prevalence for limb-girdle type (autosomal recessive) found in the mountain districts
could be explained at least in part by
endogamy in small populations, considering that in poor districts, far from main
roads, the probability of nonrandom mating is higher and leads progressively to
the formation of inbred populations. On
the other hand, it must be remembered
that in this area the prevalence of the
Duchenne type (X-linked recessive) is
rather low.

It is conceivable that the mountain en

Vol. 21, No. 3

vironment could represent a disadvantage
for the heterozygous carriers of Duchenne.
It is reported that the expression of this
gene is found occasionally also in carrier
females (Emery, 1963). Another possibility is that the presence of an affected
child in a family could represent a2 disadvantage for his sisters in marrying, decreasing the probability of reproduction.

In conclusion, we can propose the following hypotheses to account for the observed differences in distribution: (1) The
population of the area considered in the
survey is heterogeneous. This heterogeneity could have arisen in the early ages as
a result of invasion from the north and
northeast, and these differences in gene
composition could have been preserved by
geographical and/or cultural isolation. (2)
The differences in prevalence and in the
proportions of different types are attributable to an effect of genetic drift in early
ages, followed by the stabilizing effect of
socioeconomic and cultural conditions.

Hereditary Myopathies in Italy

241

In our opinion, in both cases, socioeconomic factors have played an important
role in the molding and maintaining of
genetic equilibria within human micropopulations.

SUMMARY

The results of a survey in northeast
Italy of different forms of hereditary muscular dystrophy are reported. The limbgirdle form appears to be more frequent
in the mountain districts than on the
plain, where the Duchenne form occurs
more often. Genetic and ecological implications of this peculiar distribution are discussed.
