Larger Body Size and Earlier Menarche:

The End May Be in Sight

The secular or long-term trends toward
larger body size and earlier maturation,
documented for well over a century in the
United States and Western Europe, are
among “the most considerable phenomena
of human biology at present, [with] a host
of medical, educational, and sociological
effects” (Tanner, 1964, p. 357). Per generation of 33 years, height has increased
by roughly 1 inch (2.54 cm) and weight by
3 to 4 pounds (1.4 to 1.8 kg), while age at
menarche has advanced by 1 year per generation (Tanner, 1964). Despite occasional
claims that the stature increase is an artifact, due solely to earlier maturation
(Morant, 1947; Huber, 1968), there is
ample evidence that both trends are real
(Damon, 1965; Tanner, 1968). Needless
to say, the trends cannot be extrapolated
backward or forward indefinitely; indeed,
menarche seems to have occurred considerably earlier in antiquity and the Renaissance than during the late eighteenth and
early nineteenth centuries (Shakespeare,

1597; Tanner, 1966; Amundesen and
Diers, 1969; Glick, 1969).

At present, in the general population of
the United States, body size continues to
increase (Stoudt et al., 1965) and menarche
to occur earlier (Damon et al., 1969;
Zacharias and Wurtman, 1969). However,
among the well-to-do—specifically, Harvard and Wellesley students coming from
private schools—height may have stabilized
(Bakwin and McLaughlin, 1964; Damon,
1968). This possibility is best tested by
comparing trends for successive generations
within families attending private colleges,
an approach which reduces both genetic
and environmental variance. The environment of such families is not only more
uniform than that of the population at
large, but it is likely to be optimal for the
time and place in respect to nutrition and
health, two major determinants of the
secular trends.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data on body size and age at menarche
were obtained for 500 mothers and their
522 daughters, all of whom attended Mount
Holyoke or Wellesley, private women’s
colleges in Massachusetts, between 1930

and 1970. The mothers’ birthdates ranged
from 1911 to 1931 (median, 1920); the
daughters’, from 1934 to 1953 (median,
1948). At each college, the Alumnae Office
supplied the names of mother-daughter
pairs to the Health Service, which abstracted data from individual records on
file. As supplied to me, the compilations
identify mother-daughter pairs only by
number, to preserve confidentiality.
Although ancestry was not specified, previous research at Wellesley (Bakwin and
McLaughlin, 1964) and my own sample
(not used here) of Wellesley mothers of
Radcliffe daughters indicate that virtually
all subjects were white, mainly of Northwest European descent. Type of secondary
school was not available for the mothers,
but 169 daughters (32 per cent) had attended private schools; the rest, public
schools. Examination procedures had not
changed over the years at either college.
Height and weight were measured with the
student nude or minimally clothed, without
shoes. Age at menarche was asked by a
physician as part of the medical history.
While recall does introduce error, if 0.5
year is added to correct for recall to the
whole year the error does not distort the
mean or variance of the actual age, even
when recall is 17 to 19 years after the
event (Livson and McNeil, 1962; Damon
et al., 1969). In the present case, only
5 to 6 years had elapsed, on the average,
between menarche and recall, and there is
no reason to suspect systematic or differential error by mothers or daughters.
Roughtly 91 per cent of histories and
physical examinations were obtained on
entry to college, the rest (91 Mount Holyoke mothers) later in their college careers.
While this increased their age at examination (19.0 years versus 17.9 years for
Wellesley mothers), height, weight, and
recalled age at menarche did not differ
significantly between the two colleges, for

mothers or daughters. Results for the
two colleges were therefore combined.

RESULTS

Table 1 shows (1) a slight but statistically significant increase in daughters’
height, (0.8 = se. 0.25 cm, p < 0.01),
although they averaged 0.6 years younger
than their mothers when measured; (2) a
similar increase in weight (0.73 + s.e.
0.36 kg,  < 0.05); and (3) identical recalled ages at menarche, 13.1 years. These
standard errors for height and weight are
derived from matched-pair differences, not
from the standard deviation in Table 1.

DISCUSSION

The continuing increase in height contrasts with the end of that trend reported
within Harvard families (Damon, 1968)
and for unrelated Wellesley students
(Bakwin and McLaughlin, 1964). Weight,
on the other hand, had not stabilized in
the present series, or the two just cited,
any more than it has in the United States
population as a whole (Stoudt et al., 1965).
The rate of increase in height among the
present families has slowed to about onethird and in weight to one-half of the
intergeneration differences estimated for
the general population. The health implications of continuing increase in weight,
and specifically in fat (Stoudt et al., 1970),
even in young adults, are well recognized.

Age at menarche has stabilized, among
these women, at an age of 13.1 years, later
than those reported from several recent
series of wider socioeconomic range, with
mean ages between 12.6 and 12.8 years
(Zacharias and Wurtman, 1969). The discrepancy is unexplained, although there is
evidence for population as well as individual differences in age at menarche among
the well-to-do (Tanner, 1966). Maresh
(1972) has reported, from a longitudinal
growth study among “privileged” white
girls in Denver, Colorado (1) no difference
in age at menarche between 46 girls born
before January 1, 1940 and 46 born thereafter; and (2) an actual (not recalled)
mean age at menarche identical to that
of the present subjects, 13.1 years.

Body size and age at menarche have
both genetic and environmental determinants. The more uniform the environment,
the larger becomes the contribution of
heredity to differences among individuals
and families. Mother-daughter coefficients
of correlation (7) were as follows: height,
0.53; weight, 0.30; and age at menarche,
0.28. All were highly significant (p <
0.001). That for height was close to the
0.50 expected for a trait inherited via
perfectly additive genes, without dominance. If weight and age at menarche are
similarly inherited, their lower r’s reflect
micro-environmental variation within a
highly favorable macro-environment.

As for the environmental component
of the secular trends, this study and others
(Bakwin and McLaughlin, 1964; Damon,
1968; Maresh, 1972) indicate that in the
United States the environment approached
or reached an optimum one generation ago
among the prosperous, Conditions are still
improving among the less well-off. If the
improvement continues, the end of the
trends may indeed be in sight.

The situation in Europe is more complex.
As regards age at menarche, Tanner (1973)

 

Social Biology

reports that school girls in Oslo and London
seem to have stabilized at 13.2 and 13.0
years, respectively, whereas the age continues to fall in Holland, West Hungary,
and Copenhagen.

A final question is the relationship between larger size and earlier menarche.
If the determinants of both secular trends
were the same, and if the individual’s
growth and maturation responded to them
in the same way, one would expect women
with earlier menarche than their mothers
to be correspondingly taller, and those with
later menarche to be shorter. But such
was not the case. The 7 between “difference
in menarcheal age, mother minus daughter”’
and “difference in height, daughter minus
mother” was —0.01 + 0.04. Complete
independence was also found among 78
mother-daughter pairs of average socioeconomic status in Boston (Damon et al.,
1969). These two 7’s, the discrepancy in
the present study between the continuing
increase in height and’ weight and the stabilization of age at menarche, and the
postpubertal component of the human
growth curve, all point in the same direction with respect to the secular trends:
namely, physical growth and sexual maturation, though both are slowed by adverse
environments, are distinct processes. Once
both trends have ended, it should become
easier to distinguish the determinants specific to physical growth and sexual maturation.

SUMMARY

Among 500 mothers and their 522
daughters attending Mount Holyoke and
Wellesley, private women’s colleges in
Massachusetts, between 1930 and 1970,
the daughters were very slightly taller
and heavier. Ages at menarche, recalled on
the average 5 to 6 years after the event,
were identical (13.1 years). Trends toward
larger body size and earlier menarche,

documented for well over a century and
still continuing in the general population
of the United States, may be coming to an
end among the well-to-do, for whom body
size has nearly stabilized, and age at
menarche may have stabilized.
