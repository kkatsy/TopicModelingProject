Family Size and Academic Achievement
of Persons Enrolled in High School

and the University

The purpose of this paper is to further
examine the relationship of family size and
school achievement. The argument is often
made that children in small families “do
better” academically because of the intensity of their interaction with their parents. This intensity of interaction is presumably demonstrated by parental involvement in the child’s study, hence higher
achievement. With an increase in size comes
a diminution of this adult-child relationship, hence poorer academic achievement
from the children of the larger families.

In a recent article, in which the relationship of family size and the well-being of
its members was discussed, Lieberman
(1970, p. 2) indicates:

In 1964, the Presidential Task Force on

Manpower Conservation found that about

70 percent of Selective Service rejects came

from families of four children or more,

though only 33 percent of the nation’s children came from such families. A further
breakdown showed that 47 percent of the
rejects came from the 11 percent of the
children who were members of families with
six or more offspring! Interpretation of
these results is difficult because large family

size and poverty were associated and could
not be separated for analysis.

While Lieberman did point out the inade
 

quacy of the data because control of socioeconomic status was not possible, perhaps
his inclusion of the example cited as to
how family size affects children is not warranted. Without such a control, the data
really mean very little.

Wray (1971, p. 422-429) presents various findings relative to the size of family
and intelligence. His conclusion states that
the effects of family size on intelligence
was not ameliorated by social class. A careful reexamination of these data was conducted by Thomas (1972, unpublished)
who concluded that the effects of family
size on intelligence is ameliorated by social
class.

The above are only a few of many reports, generally produced by writers who
treat population problems. However, several writers (Higgins, Reed, and Reed,
1962; Kennett and Cropley, 1970; and
Cattell, 1951) have pointed out that academic achievement is not a function of
family size.

The current question to be considered is
the relationship of grades to family size.
Other studies have reported an inverse relationship between family size and IQ.
Our assumption is that when achievement

(grades) is examined, most of the variance
can be explained in terms of social class;
that is, larger families are generally from
the lower classes and their class position
would negatively affect the grades they receive. This tends to occur both because the
schools are oriented to the middle class
and because there may be organizational
factors which work against the lower class
students getting good grades.

It may be argued that parents who have
few children would not only be able to
provide more resources such as financial
help, economic goods, etc., per child, but
they would also be in a position to offer
more “adult to child contact.” The assumption is made that it is such conduct
with adults which should promote better
grades. On the other hand, one may argue
that a child who has more sibs will have
more interaction with them, including perhaps some assistance with school problems
which would yield higher grades. A student
today with a math problem, for example,
may be hard pressed to obtain any help
from a parent who received his training in
mathematics years ago and has had no
training in the “new math.”

Responses from 2,926 male adolescents
and 3,127 female adolescents (V = 6,053)
from twenty-seven different high schools
are reported in this paper.1 The sample
approximates a cluster sample, but strictly
speaking is an accidental sample. An attempt was made to have participating high
schools in all major regions of the United
States; however, the sample is slightly
biased in favor of the Inter-mountain West.
The Northeastern part of the country is
underrepresented. Because of the interest
of high school administrators in this re
1The present study is part of a larger study
conducted by Peterson on adolescents and family
relationships. Kunz administered the questionnaire in one of the high schools sampled. Either
Peterson or his assistants administered the others.

search, the refusal rate was lower than
originally anticipated. Only seven school
districts declined the invitation to participate in the research. Three of those districts were in the Northeast.

In some cases, all of the students who
were invited to participate went into the
school auditorium or gymnasium. In other
cases, the questionnaires were administered
in the classrooms, All students were instructed how to complete the questionnaire.
Within each of the individual high schools
the sample consisted of either the total
population in school that day or a cluster
sample selected from required classes such
as English, mathematics, and health.

Table 1 represents the number of sibs the
respondents had, along with their selfreported grades. Examination of the table
indicates that for the respondents who reported having no sibs 73.8% of the respondents in the “upper class” reported
grades of B or better; 47.3% of the respondents in the “middle class” and 47.4%
of the respondents designated as “lower |
class” reported “high” grades. S.E.S. was
obtained using the McGuire Index which
utilizes income, occupation, education, and
religion to assign S.E.S. position (McGuire,
unpublished). Examination of the other
columns, with one to three sibs, four or
five sibs, and six or more sibs indicate a
similar class difference.

The very interesting point to be made
from this table is that there is no significant
difference moving across the rows, from
‘no sibs” to “Six or more sibs,” while controlling for social class. Thus, the upper
class indicates 73.8% of only-child respondents with high grades; 74.2% with
one to three sibs, 72.5% with four or five
sibs, and 69.6% with six or more sibs all
reported high grades. The gamma is very
low, less than 0.05 for each of the three

groups.

questionnaire to those who had no telephones or who could not otherwise be
reached in order to supplement the file information. In fifty cases both the phone call
and questionnaire were used for the same
respondent. Comparison of the data from
both sources indicate that the data are
reliable.

This sample included 661 male and 565
female respondents (N = 1,226), all of
whom were currently attending the university, or who had attended the previous
semester and who were still on file and
available to provide the additional information. The additional information was
coded and transferred along with the data
from the computer’s file to IBM cards via
scanning sheets. Pearson correlations were
then computed for family size by the various measures of grade achievements. In
some cases the WV varies because of the
unavailability of ACT scores which were
missing for older students who did not take

those examinations. They were not offered .

when some of them entered the University.

relationships between family size and
grades for university students.

Closer examination of the relationship
between the number of sibs and the university grade-point average is shown in
Table 3. Unfortunately, we had no other
indicator of social class than the father’s
education. Using this as a control, we are
able to examine the association of family
size with grade-point average and find that
the father’s education appears to make
some difference in terms of the percentage
receiving “low” and “high” grades.

While the number of respondents is understandably lower, note the tendency for
larger families to have more of the “high”
grades. However, for the left and right
part of the table, there is no statistically
significant difference.

Partial correlations of first, second, and
third order, for number of children, father’s
education, and sex of the respondent also
indicate no statistically significant differences. Difference of means tests (using the
T-test) for the mean cumulative gradepoint average for small, medium, and large
families while controlling father’s education and sex were also not statistically
significant. In short, the data do not support the idea that there are grade-point
differences associated with family size.

The argument may be made that students at Brigham Young University do not
represent the whole spectrum of Mormon
society and therefore cannot be used to
indicate the effects of the Mormon culture
which has positive rewards for the large
family. A closer examination of the data
from the high schools, reported above, will
provide data to examine the argument.

Data from Peterson’s study permit us to
examine Mormon high school students and
to compare them with other religions. Table
4 presents the respondents who either indicated no religious affiliation or were Catholic, Protestant, or Mormon. Other groups

were not examined here because of their
small number. Note the rather curvilinear
relationship within each row except for the
Protestant. However, in general, there is a
very weak relationship between grades and
number of sibs. The data in the university sample above showed no curvilinear
relationship. Further study of this should
be made, but we should point out that the
contingency coefficients computed for the
data represented in the reported curvilinear relationships were not significant.
A rather interesting point may be observed as one examines the Mormon respondents reporting high grades. When
there are “no sibs” only 45.2% report
“high” grades, less than the Catholics or
the Protestants. However, in all other
categories in the table, the Mormons are
somewhat higher. This may be a reflection
of the lack of support generally in one-child
families among Mormons. The differences
between Mormons and the other categories
are interesting in any event, with the

66.1%, 69.3%, and 59.9% which are associated with “high” grades.

SUMMARY

This paper suggests that literature dealing with family size, as it may influence
the sibs, needs to be more carefully examined. While the data in this paper examine family size only as it relates to the
achievement of grades, the finding of no
relationship between grades and family
size appears to be significant. It should
be pointed out that the present samples
included only individuals with IQ’s high
enough to maintain themselves in high
school and college. This finding generally
supports the findings of Higgins, Reed,
and Reed (1962), Reed (1971), and others, but is contrary to reports of Wray
(1971) and Lieberman (1970). Other variables also need to be examined to test the
accuracy of statements made by some of
the proponents of the superior position
of the small family.
