Inconsistencies in the Timing of First
Sexual Intercourse and First Birth

ABSTRACT: Survey data from a number of developing countries show that a considerable proportion of parous women report that they had their first birth one or more years before they first
had sexual intercourse. In this paper, I use data from eight African Demographic and Health
Surveys to explore factors that contribute to cross-national differentials in the prevalence of
these “immaculate conceptions.’’ The results suggest that this data problem results not only
from recall errors, but also from the fact that some respondents misinterpret the question on
first sexual intercourse and report their age at the onset of intercourse with either their first or
current husband rather than their age at sexual initiation.

Demographic data for several developing countries show that a significant percentage of parous women reported that they delivered their first
baby one or more years before having
first sexual intercourse. I refer to this
phenomenon as “immaculate conceptions!.”’ In this paper, I describe the
magnitude of this data problem and explore factors that may contribute to
these inconsistencies in the reporting
of the timing of first sexual intercourse
and first birth using Demographic and
Health Survey (DHS) data for eight
countries of sub-Saharan Africa as an
example.?

1This term is conceptually different from the
term “virgin births,” which has been used in the anthropological literature to refer to ideologies that
explain childbirth without reference to physiological
paternity (e.g., Leach, 1966; Spiro, 1968).

2Note that this problem is equally prevalent in
some non-African countries (e.g., Brazil and Guatemala; see Blanc and Rutenberg, 19905), as well as

In sub-Saharan Africa, three countries stand out because of their high
percentage of immaculate conceptions:
Botswana (6.2 per cent), Kenya (11.1
per cent), and Mali (8.8 per cent). Although some data errors are always
expected, considering that even uneducated women are aware of the
link between sexual intercourse and
childbearing, such high percentages of
women reporting having sex for the
first time more than one year after having their first baby are startling.

The occurrence of these immaculate
conceptions must of course be attributed to errors in the data. Hence, one
may expect to find a higher prevalence
of immaculate conceptions in those
countries whére data quality is comparatively poor. However, Table 1 shows

in some surveys that are not part of the DHS program (e.g., the Nigeria WFS survey, own calculations).

that there is no clear relationship between the percentage of immaculate
conceptions and indicators of data
quality. While Mali, Liberia, and Togo
all have data of a relatively poor quality, only Mali stands out because of its
high prevalence of immaculate conceptions. Similarly, Botswana and Kenya
have relatively good data by African
standards, but have a high percentage
of immaculate conceptions. Clearly, a
critical examination of the data is warranted. A better understanding of the
factors that contribute to this type of
data error may help improve the quality of future surveys.

FAcTorS CONTRIBUTING TO
IMMACULATE CONCEPTIONS

Whatever the cause for the inconsistencies between age at first intercourse and age at first birth, it is clear
that immaculate conceptions would be
uncommon if there were systematic efforts to cross-validate the information
on first intercourse and first birth. In
part, this lack of systematic crossvalidation may be due to the setup of
the questionnaire. In many demographic surveys, including the DHS
surveys, questions about sex, marriage, and childbearing are deliberately asked in different sections of the
questionnaire to ensure that the answers would not influence each other.
For example, to reduce the likelihood
that a never-married woman would be
hesitant to report births and/or use of
family planning methods, questions
about marriage and sexual behavior
are not asked until after the birth history and the section on family planning. Consequently, respondents and/
or interviewers may not make the logical connection between the timing of

Social Biology

first sex and first birth when reporting
this information. Moreover, crossvalidation of the two events is complicated by the fact that age at first birth
is not asked directly, but is calculated
from the date of first birth.

There has been much debate about
whether questions on sexual activity
cause embarrassment to respondents
and interviewers (see Blanc and
Rutenberg, 1990a; Caraél et al., 1990;
Cleland and Kalule-Sabiti, 1984;
Standing, 1992). Some authors have
argued that data on sexual behavior
can only be obtained through anthropological methods (Caldwell, 1985;
Caldwell et al., 1989), because surveys
may not pick up inaccuracies:

Pitfalls in the collection of data on age
at first sexual intercourse include responses that are formulated on the basis
of expected behavior; difficulty in recalling the age at which one first had
Sexual intercourse, especially among
older women; and the disinclination of
women to admit that they had premarital sexual intercourse, especially if it occurred with a partner other than their
current one. Unmarried women may
overestimate their age at first sexual experience out of a reluctance to admit to
having already engaged in sexual relations, or they may underestimate that
age if they feel pressure from their
peers to be sexually active at a young
age (Blanc and Rutenberg, 1991, pp.
163-164). .

It is reassuring, however, that respondents appear to be quite willing to
talk about their sexual behavior (Blanc
and Rutenberg, 1990a, 1990b, 1991).
Nonresponse rates for age at first sexual intercourse in the African DHS
surveys are very low, ranging from 0.1
per cent in Burundi and Ghana to 3.4
per cent in Liberia. Moreover, in most
African DHS surveys a large percent

age of never-married women report
that they had sexual intercourse; likewise, many ever-married women admit
to having premarital sexual intercourse. Hence, concerns about the
sensitivity of the topic may be exaggerated. As Caraél et al. (1990) point
out, in the not-so-distant past similar
doubts have been raised about the
quality of data on family planning behavior, and those doubts turned out to
be unwarranted as well.

Although it is probably a good idea
to maintain a healthy sense of skepticism about the quality of data on sexual
intercourse, one must acknowledge
that immaculate conceptions may be
caused by factors other than the respondents’ reluctance or inability to
provide information on sexual intercourse. Cross-national differences in
the prevalence of immaculate conceptions may result from differences in the
extent of data editing and cleaning, but
also from differences in the wording,
translation, and sequence of questions.
For example, if the question on first
sexual intercourse immediately follows
a set of questions about the first hus
band, or if the question is translated
poorly (see Vaessen et al., 1984; Ware,
1977), some respondents may misinterpret the question and report not their
age at first sexual intercourse (i.e., loss
of virginity), but rather the age at
which they started having intercourse
with their first husband. This paper examines to what extent such factors explain cross-national differentials in the
prevalence of immaculate conceptions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This paper uses data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)
from Botswana, Burundi, Ghana,
Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Togo, and Zimbabwe. These surveys were conducted
between 1986 and 1989 and contain information on women aged 15~49; sample sizes range from 3,200 in Mali to
7,150 in Kenya. Each survey used here
contains information on the respondent’s age at first sexual intercourse
and age at first birth. Age at first sexual
intercourse was obtained directly, age
at first birth was obtained indirectly
(i.e., calculated) from the respondent’s

date of birth, and the date of birth of
her first child. The dependent variable,
which measures the occurrence of an
immaculate conception, is a dummy
variable which indicates whether or not
age at first birth precedes age at first
intercourse. Because age at first sexual
intercourse is measured in completed
years only differences of at least one
completed year can be observed.

RESULTS
DATE EDITING AND CLEANING

Immaculate conceptions may not
appear in the published data files because they have been removed during
the data-editing stage. Some countries
in the DHS program have applied the
so-called “rule of one” to correct inconsistencies. If the age at first sexual
intercourse exceeded the age at first
conception by exactly one year, then
the age at first sex was decreased by
one year to make the figures consistent
(Blanc and Rutenberg, 1990a, 1990b;
Institute for Resource Development,
1989, p. 131). If the inconsistency was
larger than one year, no correction
was made, but age at first intercourse
coded was “inconsistent.”’ Thus, in
countries where the rule of one was
used, there are no cases where age at
first sexual intercourse exceeds age at
first birth by exactly one completed
year. Table 2 shows that such ts the
case for all countries, except for
Liberia and Togo.

3For most countries, there is no published information on the use of the rule of one. DHS does not
maintain a record of the countries that used the rule
of one, since that decision was made individually by
each country (DHS, personal communication). Inconsistencies that remain after data cleaning are
sometimes noted in the Individual Recode Documentation (see Institute for Resource Development, s.d., for Liberia and Zimbabwe).

 

 

Social Biology

In addition to cleaning in the dataediting stage, there may have been
field editing by interviewers and respondents. When a respondent does
not know at what age she first had
intercourse, DHS interviewers are instructed to probe by relating it to how
old a woman was when her first child
was born, or when she first got married, making sure not to assume that
a woman first had sex at the time of
first marriage (Institute for Resource
Development, 1987b, pp. 60-62). No
cross-validation of responses is required if the respondent does report
her age at first sexual intercourse.

The extent of field editing cannot be
evaluated because responses are not
flagged for field editing. However, information on the type of reporting of
the date of first birth allows us to examine the effect of imputation of missing dates. It is expected that inconsistencies are less likely to occur when
dates are imputed completely because
no information is available, since imputation is performed consistent with
the available information whenever
possible:

In most surveys, age at first sex was used
as a constraint on the imputation of both
date of first union and date of first birth
in cases where no other information was
available. Thus, the number of cases imputed on the basis of no information will
affect the proportion of inconsistent responses (Blanc and Rutenberg, 1990b,
p. 70).

The percentage of immaculate conceptions by type of reporting of date of
first birth is shown in Table 3. As expected, immaculate conceptions tend
to be uncommon when the date of first
birth has been imputed completely,
except for Liberia and Mali. When the

date of first birth is imputed partially,
the prevalence of immaculate conceptions tends to be high, particularly in
Kenya. It is clear, however, that date
imputation is not responsible for the
cross-national differentials in immaculate conceptions, since these differentials also exist for respondents whose
date of first birth was not imputed.

RECALL ERRORS

If recall errors account for the inconsistencies between age at first sexual intercourse and age at first birth,
then the problem should be less acute,
or perhaps nonexistent, for children
born recently. For all countries, the
percentage of immaculate conceptions
is substantially lower for the most recent birth cohorts than for older birth
cohorts (Table 3). In Burundi, Ghana,
Liberia, and Togo, less than 1 per cent
of first births born during the 1980's
are immaculate. Nevertheless, in those
countries where the problem of inconsistencies between age at first intercourse and age at first birth is most
common overall, the most recent birth
cohorts also have a high percentage
of immaculate conceptions: Botswana

(3.4 per cent), Kenya (6.3 per cent),
and Mali (5.1 per cent).4 These results
confirm that recall errors contribute
to the problem considerably, but also
that recall errors alone are not sufficient to account for the variation in the
prevalence of immaculate conceptions
across countries.

THE QUESTIONNAIRE

Attempts to adapt the standard
DHS questionnaire to local socioeconomic and cultural circumstances have
introduced some differences between
countries. For example, the question
on age at first sexual intercourse has
been phrased differently in some countries. In Liberia women were asked
how old they were when they first did
‘“‘men business,” and in Mali when they
first had an “intimate friend.”’ Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine
if these different wordings were interpreted similarly by all women.

4In many DHS surveys interviewers sometimes
deliberately overestimated the age of young children to avoid having to ask questions about child
health (e.g., Arnold, 1990). A more detailed breakdown by year of birth of the first child (not shown)
indicates that this type of error has little or no effect
on the prevalence of immaculate conceptions.

Apart from these differences in the
phrasing of the question on age at first
sexual intercourse, the questions that
precede the question on first intercourse also differ between countries,
but only for ever-married women (Institute for Resource Development,
1987a). Never-married women were
always asked if they ever had sexual
intercourse and, if so, at what age they
first had sexual intercourse. Evermarried women, on the other hand,
were asked about their age at first
intercourse only after responding to a
set of questions relating to their first
union. This set of questions varies between countries. The question on first
sexual intercourse may follow a
question on age at first cohabitation
(Botswana, Liberia, Mali, and Zimbabwe), additional questions about the
first union (Burundi), questions about
residence patterns since the first union
(Ghana and Kenya), or a union history, questions about partner choice,
and about the respondent’s most recent union (Togo).

A sequence of questions that focuses on the first union may be confusing, causing women to report age at
first intercourse with their husband,
rather than age at loss of virginity. If
these additional questions asked of
ever-married women cause confusion
about the interpretation of the question on first sexual intercourse, then it
is expected that ever-married women
will be more likely to report immaculate conceptions than never-married
women. Moreover, if immaculative
conceptions stem from normative reporting that sexual activity started
upon marriage, then the problem
should be much Jess prevalent among
never-married women. The results

 

Immaculate Conceptions 157

shown in Table 3 confirm that evermarried women are more likely to report an inconsistent age at first intercourse and age at first birth than
women who never married, but the differences are fairly small.

PREMARITAL CHILDBEARING

The possibility that some respondents report age at first intercourse
with their current partner rather than
age at loss of virginity merits further
attention. In such cases offspring from
previous sexual relationships will show
up as immaculate conceptions. Unfortunately, it is not possible to identify
children who were born before the respondent and her first husband started
having sexual intercourse. As a proxy,
Table 3 shows the prevalence of immaculate conceptions for marital and
premarital first births.> The percentage
of immaculate conceptions is consistently higher for premarital births than
for marital births.

In Burundi, Ghana, and Liberia,
immaculate conceptions are more than
four times as common for premarital
births than for marital births. In Togo,
age at first sex and age at first birth are
inconsistent for 9 per cent of respondents who had a premarital birth, as
opposed to 1 per cent of those who had
their first child within wedlock. In the
most extreme case, that of Mali, inconsistencies occur for 68 per cent of
women who reported a premarital
birth, and only 2 per cent for those with
marital first births. It is noteworthy
that in Botswana, Liberia, Mali, and

>Women have been coded as having a premarital
birth if their age at first birth (in completed years)
precedes their age at first union, or if they had a

158 Meekers

Togo more than two out of every three
immaculate conceptions are premarital
births. In Burundi, Ghana, Kenya, and
Zimbabwe, this is the case for 28-42
per cent of immaculate conceptions.

It is unlikely that respondents deliberately misreported their age at first
sexual intercourse in order to conform
with the cultural norms. Indeed, respondents who inflated their age at
first intercourse to hide that they were
sexually active before marriage, also
would deny having a premarital birth.
The finding that women who report
having a premarital birth are most
likely to report an immaculate conception strongly suggests that the information for some respondents refers not
to their first sexual relationship, but
rather to a subsequent one. The latter
may have occurred either because the
respondent misinterpreted the question, or because the interviewer erroneously assumed that the respondent
was not sexually active before marriage.

We now examine if these bivariate
effects persist after controlling for
other variables. Table 4 shows the results of a logistic regression analysis estimating the effect of the child’s birth
status, recall error, date imputation,
and the sequence of questions on the
likelihood that a woman reported an
immaculate conception, after controlling for literacy and place of residence.
The impact of imputation ts measured
by a dummy variable indicating
whether or not any imputation of the
date of first birth took place. Year of
first birth is used as a proxy for the recall time. The effect of the sequence of
questions is measured via marital status, because the sequence of questions
preceding the question on age at first

 

Social Biology

sexual intercourse is different for evermarried and never-married women.

Consistent with the bivariate results, two predictors stand out. More
recent births are consistently less likely
to be reported as immaculate conceptions, and premarital births are significantly more likely than marital births
to be reported as such. These multivariate results show that immaculate
conceptions are not solely caused by
recall problems. Even after controlling
for the year of first birth and other variables, birth status has a very strong effect on the likelihood of reporting an
immaculate conception. This finding
suggests that immaculate conceptions
partly result from the fact that some
women report not their age at loss of
virginity, but rather their age at first intercourse with a subsequent partner
(probably their current or their first
husband).

It is important to acknowledge that
the effects of recall error and birth status, although highly significant in all
countries, are not sufficient to fully explain cross-country differentials in the
prevalence of immaculate conceptions.
The latter would require a thorough
examination of the effect of using
translated questionnaires, of conducting interviews in languages other than
the native tongue of the respondent
and/or interviewers, and of differential
interviewer quality. For example, in
Kenya Interviewers #13 and #14 both
interviewed mostly Kalenjin women,
but recorded 1.3% immaculate conceptions and 20.0% respectively. This
finding may indicate that #13 is a better interviewer. However, since the
Kalenjin are a composite ethnic cluster, one interviewer may have interviewed in his/her mother tongue, while

DISCUSSION

While analyzing data quality of demographic surveys is often difficult, inconsistencies between the age at first
sexual intercourse and first birth are
easy to detect. Since conception cannot
occur without having sexual intercourse (ignoring in vitro fertilization),
any cases for which first birth precedes
first sexual intercourse must be errors.
Surprisingly, such inconsistencies are
quite common in some countries. The
percentage of inconsistent responses
ranged from 1 per cent in Burundi to
11 per cent in Kenya. It is not obvious
why these inconsistencies have not
been noticed by the respondent or interviewer. Most likely, cross-checking
the information was difficult because
age at first birth is obtained indirectly
from the date of birth of the respondent and the date of birth of her first
child. ‘

In order to avoid or at least reduce
this type of problem in future surveys,
it is important to get a better understanding of the factors that may contribute to this type of error. Inconsistencies between the timing of first birth
and first sexual intercourse may stem
from a number of factors, including
differences related to the questionnaire (the wording and translation of
questions; the sequence of questions),
differential data editing procedures
(the “rule of one’), errors due to imputation of missing dates, errors due to
reporting of normative rather than actual behavior, as well as recall errors.

The hypothesis that immaculate
conceptions may result from the fact
that women give normative responses
to the question on age at first sexual
intercourse is not supported by the
data. The normative pattern would be
for women to deny having premarital
sexual intercourse, by overestimating
their age at first sexual experience. For
example, in Islamic societies women
may overestimate their age at first sexual intercourse because of the strong
stigma placed on premarital sexual:

intercourse and premarital pregnancies. However, the data indicate that
women who had a premarital first
birth are significantly more likely than
women with a marital first birth to report an immaculate conception, even
after controlling for other factors. This
pattern holds for all countries. Obviously, it is unlikely that women who
want to deny having premarital intercourse will lie about their age at first
sexual experience, but admit to having
a premarital birth. Consequently, the
possibility that women are deliberately
overestimating their age at first sexual
intercourse must be ruled out. Instead,
the results suggest that some women
may be confused and report not their
age at loss of virginity, but rather their
age at the onset of sexual relations with
a subsequent partner.

The data support the argument that
immaculate conceptions result in part
from recall errors in the reporting of
the timing of first birth and/or first

sexual intercourse. In all countries the ©

prevalence of immaculate conceptions
is substantially lower for more recent
birth cohorts, and this effect persists
after controlling for other factors. The
analysis did not reveal a significant impact related to the sequence of questions, data-editing procedures, or date
imputation.

This study brings two important issues to attention. First, inconsistent
responses may bias research on first
sexual intercourse, since age at first intercourse is not coded for such cases.
More importantly, if women report not
their age at loss of virginity but their
age at onset of sexual relations with a
subsequent partner, but responses are
consistent, then estimates of the mean
age at first sexual intercourse will be
biased upward.

 

Social Biology

The second issue that needs to be
addressed is how similar problems can
be avoided in future surveys. Blanc
and Rutenberg (1990b, p. 77) suggest
trying to reduce the extent to which interviewers compute age at first sexual
intercourse on the basis of the date of
first marriage, perhaps by adding a special code indicating that a respondent
reported becoming sexually active
upon marriage. It may also be helpful
to add an introduction to the question
on first sexual intercourse explaining
clearly that the enquiry refers to the
respondent’s age at loss of virginity,
rather than the onset of sexual relations with the respondent’s first husband or current partner. Alternatively,
the distinction could be made explicit
by asking both a question on the respondent’s age at loss of virginity, and
a question on her age at the onset of
sexual relations with the first husband.
Last, but not least, it seems important
to require interviewers to conduct a
consistency check for these questions
and to record more detailed information about the language of both interviewers and respondents. Survey administrators must also take care to hire
only the most qualified interviewers.
