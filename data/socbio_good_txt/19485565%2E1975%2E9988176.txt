It has been shown that maternal mental
illness, in particular, schizophrenia, increases the risk of mental illness in the
children (Rieder, 1973; Garmezy, 1974a,
19746). One explanation for this greater
risk (Rosenthal, 1971) is that schizophrenic
mothers have greater difficulty with pregnancy and childbirth, so that their children
encounter a greater number of perinatal
complications, including lower birth weight,
factors which are related to the subsequent
development of neurological deficits (Corah,
1965; Pasamanick and Knobloch, 1966;
Knobloch and Pasamanick, 1962; Sameroff
and Zax, 19735) as well as to the subsequent development of psychiatric disorders
(Lilienfield et al., 1955; Pollack and
Woerner, 1966; Woerner et al., 1973;
Pollin and Stabenau, 1968; Mednick et al.,
1971), The present paper reviews the current status of this hypothesis concerning an

association between maternal mental illness and the presence of pregnancy and
birth complications (PBCs)! and reports
additional data relevant to this hypothesis,
based on groups of schizophrenic, depressed,
and well mothers and their children.

Using a design in which mothers of newborn children and their offspring are contrasted with nonschizophrenic (well) mothers and infants, conflicting results have
been reported concerning the role of maternal mental illness in determining PBCs.
On the one hand, using largely Black lower
lower-class groups of mothers and infants,
Wiedorn (1954) reports a significantly
greater amount of pre-eclampsia and
eclampsia among schizophrenic mothers,
while Schacter (quoted in Garmezy, 19740),
also using lower lower-class Black schizo
1In the present study, as in other such reports,
it is assumed that the mother’s health and life
habits so directly affect prenatal development that,
in practice, it is difficult to separate effects on the
child’s postnatal development due to the mother’s
state as contrasted with those due to the child’s
developmental course either during pregnancy or
during Jabor and delivery.

phrenic and nonschizophrenic control
groups, reports a significantly greater number of PBCs among the infants of schizophrenic mothers.

Paffenbarger et al. (1961), Paffenbarger
and McCabe (1966), and Mednick and
Schulsinger (1968) had reported a greater
number of PBCs among schizophrenic
mothers and their infants than among control mother-infant pairs. However, subsequent study by Mednick et al. (1971,
1973) of a larger sample of schizophrenic
and well mothers and infants did not show
this group difference. Mednick (1970) and
his colleagues do report that in considering
PBCs among schizophrenic mothers and
their now adolescent offspring (approximately half of whom had also developed
mental illness), they found 70 per cent of
the schizophrenic mother-disturbed offspring pairs had earlier been characterized
as having at least one PBC, as contrasted
with 15 per cent of the schizophrenic
mother—well offspring pairs and 33 per cent
of the well mother—well offspring pairs.
This finding suggests that PBCs are among
the factors contributing to increased vulnerability among those children of mentally
ill mothers who themselves also eventually
succumb to mental illness.

Other research (Maura, 1971; McNeil
and Kaij, 1973, 1974; Sameroff and Zax,
1973a), typically comparing the number
of PBCs shown by schizophrenic motherinfant pairs as contrasted with those shown
by mentally il] but not schizophrenic
mother-child pairs and well mother-child
pairs, has shown little relationship between
maternal mental illness and the presence
of PBCs. Sameroff and Zax’s study (1973a)
does suggest that, within patient groups,
the more severe (chronic) the mother’s
disturbance, the greater the number of
PBCs. These authors suggest that the
greater anxiety and decreased personal
competence which characterize chronically

Social Biology

psychotic mothers, regardless of diagnostic
category, interfere with such normal biological processes as childbirth.

While most studies have used the number
of PBCs as a measure of the extent to
which childbirth was hazardous for the
child, several studies have also employed
birth weight as a measure. Kallmann
(1938), Sobel (1961), Paffenbarger and
McCabe (1966), and Mednick et al. (1971,
1973) have all reported that the birth
weight of children born to schizophrenic
(psychotic) mothers was lower than that
of controls. Lane and Albee (1970) examined the birth weight of several hundred
infants born to schizophrenic and normal
parents and reported that no such group
differences in birth weight were found.
Similar negative results have been reported
by McNeil and Kaij (1973).

In addition to the results reported by
Mednick’s research group (1968, 1970),
Reider et al. (1975) report a significantly
greater number of fetal and neonatal
deaths among offspring of schizophrenic
mothers as contrasted with offspring of
well controls. Since much of the interest
at present is in the role of schizophrenia as
a determinant of PBCs, the most appropriate comparative design is that employing
matched groups of schizophrenic, psychotic
but not schizophrenic, and well mothers
and their children.

Since maternal age, sex of offspring’,
and number of previous pregnancies have
all been shown to be positively associated
with a greater number of PBCs (Pasamanick and Knobloch, 1966; Maura, 1971),
it is important that patient and nonpatient
groups be equated on such factors. Only
the recent report of McNeil and Kaij
(1974) appears to employ such a design.
In addition, when considering differences
within the several diagnostic groups, it is

are at higher risk than girls for PBCs.

important to separate the effects due to
chronicity or severity of illness from diagnosis and to determine the extent to which
there is an interaction between these factors
in the report of a greater number of PBCs.
This interaction has not been examined
systematically in prior research on PBCs.

Based on this review of the literature,
we can formulate two specific hypotheses
for empirical study: (1) There will be no
group differences either in the number of
PBCs or in the birth weight of the children
of schizophrenic, depressed, or well mothers. (2) Within the patient group, there
will be an interaction between diagnosis
and chronicity of disturbance in determining the number of PBCs, with chronic
schizophrenic mother-child pairs experiencing the greater number of PBCs,

MATERIALS AND METHODS
THE GROUPS

The data were taken from a larger study
in which intensive nursing aftercare was
provided for psychotic mothers with young
children following the mother’s discharge
from a psychiatric hospital (Grunebaum
et al., 1971, 1974; Hartman et al., 1973).
The goal of the intervention study was to
help these mothers to function more effectively in their adult role and to prevent
rehospitalization by providing supportive
home treatment.

Women hospitalized for mental illness
following childbirth were originally referred
to the aftercare project by state or private
mental hospitals in the greater Boston area.
Over the course of two years, forty-two
mothers were recruited for the present
study, comprising nearly all those referrals
who were married, with intact families, who
had a diagnosis of psychosis, at least one
child below age five, and information available regarding all previous pregnancies and
deliveries. These former patients may be
described as a group of chronically inade

quate women with a poor premorbid history, numerous prior hospitalizations, and
extended periods of stay during each hospitalization. According to the formal diaghosis, approximately two-thirds of these
patients showed schizophrenic or schizoaffective psychoses, with one-third showing
manic-depressive or depressive psychoses.

The forty-four nonhospitalized well
women were recruited by means of newspaper advertisements. Previous research
with this means of obtaining a sample
(Cohler et al., 1968) has shown that relatively few differences appear between subjects volunteering in this manner and other
samples of young adult women. Initially,
mentally ill mothers were matched with
nonpsychiatric controls on the basis of the
husband’s occupation, wife’s occupation,
age, parity, religion (Catholic vs. nonCatholic), and age and sex of the youngest
child. In the later stages of the study, when
it proved difficult to obtain individually
matched controls, well mothers were selected in order to equate the groups overall
on these social background variables.

Demographically, these two groups are
quite homogeneous. The typical husband
in each group has at least some education
beyond high school and works either as a
clerk or salesman (patients), or as a clerk,
small businessman, or lower-echelon professional (controls). On the basis of occupation and education, these men can be described as middle class. The typical wife
also had some additional schooling beyond
high school.

Most of the families in each group included at least two other children. At the
time the children were tested, their ages
ranged between fifty-nine and seventyeight months. The “index” child was identified at the beginning of the study as the
child whose birth preceded the mother’s
most recent hospitalization.

THE MEASURES

Measurement of pregnancy and birth
complications —Following a mother’s permission for us to obtain medical records,
photocopies of hospital charts were collected for the deliveries of the index child
and all brothers and sisters. These photocopies of the obstetrical charts were then
coded using a four-point scale described by
Mednick et al. (1971). Data recorded for
subsequent analysis included the number
of PBCs recorded for each birth, the sum

of the rating on the four-point scale of the
severity of each complication, and the
highest rating or most serious complication
reported for that birth. The child’s birth
weight was also recorded.® The rating scale
is presented in Table 1. The measures selected for final analysis included the mean

3 While, as Maura (1971) notes, it is advisable
to distinguish between complications associated
with pregnancy and delivery and those associated
with the child’s neonatal status, the very small
number of total pregnancy and birth complications

among all mother-infant pairs in the study made
is impossible to make this distinction.

MATERNAL PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSIS

Each of the formerly hospitalized mothers was seen individually by two psychiatrists who determined the patient’s diagnosis and evaluated her probable prognosis
for recovery.* After determining that a
former patient had experienced a psychotic
disturbance, the exact psychiatric diagnosis
was established. It was particularly important that the defining characteristics of
schizophrenia be clearly specified. The diagnostic classification scheme devised by
Wender in Kety et al. (1968) was used for
this purpose with a two-stage process involving the differentiation between other
psychotic disturbances and schizophrenia
and, within the group of mothers classified
as schizophrenic, differentiation between
acute and chronic schizophrenia. On the
basis of previous work by Vaillant (1962,
1964) and Nuttall and Solomon (1965),
ratings were also made on a number of
dichotomous variables that had been shown
to be related to good prognosis and a total
prognosis score was obtained. These variables included: presence of depressive heredity, evidence of depressive symptoms at
the time of hospitalization, evidence of
discrete life events precipitating the illness,
onset of symptoms within six months immediately prior to hospitalization, absence
of a withdrawn-schizoid adjustment prior
to hospitalization, and evidence of cognitive
confusion at the time of hospitalization.

Data was also obtained from the patient
and from hospital records regarding other
aspects of treatment, including the number
of hospitalizations and the number of days

ever hospitalized. On the basis of this interview and record information, each patient was rated on the overall chronicity
of her illness. Interjudge agreement of at
least 91 per cent was obtained between
two independent clinicians for each of these
ratings, and discrepancies between the two
independent raters were resolved by conference.

REQUESTS AND DISCUSSION

The first step in the analysis was to determine the relationship between the measures of PBCs employed in the study. The
correlations among these measures and between these measures and demographic
factors are presented separately for patients
and controls in Table 2. For mentally ill
mothers, these dimensions are relatively independent of each other, and demographic
factors are associated only with PBCs related to previous pregnancies, However, for
the well controls, significant correlations
are found between the presence of PBCs
for both previous and present pregnancies
and, as was true for patients, there is a
relationship between the number of prior
pregnancies and the number of PBCs
during these pregnancies.

COMPARISON OF MENTALLY ILL AND
WELL GROUPS

The first hypothesis states that patient
and nonpatient groups will not differ in the
mean number of PBCs recorded, either for
previous pregnancies or for that of the index
offspring. Data concerning this hypothesis
are presented in Table 3. In contrast to
other studies of birth complications among
patient and nonpatient groups, which typically employ ¢-test comparisons among all
possible groups and thereby inflate the
probability of finding group differences, the
present report employs the more conservative one-way analysis of variance. Using
this procedure, it is appropriate to examine

group of forty-two psychotic mothers and

psychiatric symptoms, and only three of
the forty-four index children of nonhospitalized controls (7 per cent) show psychiatric symptoms; at the present time,
these few disturbed young children cannot
be differentiated from their peers on the
basis of PBCs.

The data in Table 2, while based on a
small number of cases, indicate that maternal mental illness does not appear to lead
to an increase in the number of PBCs.
However, there is an additional way of examining this question. Mednick (1970) reanalyzed his earlier birth complication data
(Mednick and Schlusinger, 1968), using
the criterion of one or more PBCs as an
index of difficulty in childbirth. Using this
index, Mednick found that 70 per cent of
the children in his group of mentally ill
youngsters of schizophrenic mothers experienced difficulty during pregnancy and
delivery, as contrasted with 15 per cent of
the well children of schizophrenic mothers
and 33 per cent of the children of normal
mothers. Using this criterion for determining birth difficulty, our data show that,
considering all prior pregnancies, 37 per
cent of schizophrenic mother-child pairs
had experienced PBCs as contrasted with
28 per cent of psychotic depressed motherchild pairs and 22 per cent of well motherchild pairs. The association between diagnostic group and presence of PBCs does
not begin to approach significance (chisquare equals 1.83 with 6 degrees of freedom) showing that there is no greater risk
of PBCs among schizophrenic mothers than
among depressed or normal mothers.

Similar findings emerge when considering the number of PBCs recorded for the
index child. Among index children of
schizophrenic mothers, 37 per cent experienced one or more PBCs as compared
with 21 per cent of the index children of
depressed mothers and 27 per cent of the
index children of nonhospitalized controls.
The association between diagnostic group

Pregnancy and Birth Complications

 

275

and presence of birth complications for the
index child was not significant (chi-square
equals 1.25 with 6 degrees of freedom). On
the basis of the criterion of one or more
PBCs, it is again clear that, overall, mentally ill mother-child pairs are no more
likely than well pairs to show PBCs.

DIAGNOSIS, CHRONICITY, AND PREGNANCY
AND BIRTH COMPLICATIONS

The second hypothesis predicts an interaction between diagnostic group and
chronicity of the mother’s disturbance in
determining the number of PBCs. Specifically, it is expected that the greatest number of PBCs would be found among chronic
schizophrenic mother-child pairs. While the
number of mothers within each group was
rather small, it was possible to employ a
two-way analysis of variance, with diagnostic group (schizophrenic vs. depressed)
and chronicity (acute vs. chronic) as the
independent variables.® It should be noted
that there is little association between these
two variables (chi-square equals 0.01 with
6 degrees of freedom). Since there was an
interaction effect for the number of prior
pregnancies significant at close to the conventional 0.05 significance level, with the
acute depressed mothers having had a
somewhat larger number of pregnancies,
the analysis-of-variance employed a covariance adjustment for number of prior
births, This data is presented in Table 4.

Even when adjusted for number of previous births, there is an interaction between
chronicity of illness and diagnostic category
in the number of PBCs, but in the opposite
direction from that which we had expected.
For all prior births excluding the present
(index) child’s birth, acutely depressed
mothers show the greatest mean number
of PBCs. However, considering the index
child, it is the acute schizophrenic motherinfant pairs who show the greatest number

5 Diagnostic information on one mother was in
complete; thus, only 41 of the 42 mentally ill
mothers are included in the analysis.

of PBCs. These results suggest that, in the
case of both present and past births, it is
the children of acute rather than chronic
mothers who are at greatest risk. Since the
number of patients and their children
within three of the four diagnostic groups
is quite small, our results must be viewed
with caution. However, these results suggests that when controlling for number of
prior births (a measure of increased exposure of risk of PBCs), and including both
chronic and acute patients within each
diagnostic category, the results are contrary
to what might be expected.

CONCLUSION

Consistent with other recent research
comparing mentally ill and well motherchild pairs, the results of the present research suggest that maternal psychiatric
disturbance, as such, has little impact on
the development of pregnancy and birth
complications. The children of mentally ill
women do not appear to be at greater risk
than the children of well women for such
perinatal complications simply as a result
of their mothers’ psychiatric illness, In the
present study, we have not considered pregnancy and birth complications among
women already ill at the time of their most
recent pregnancy, as contrasted with women
well at the time of pregnancy and delivery
who developed their psychiatric illness first
during the period after childbirth. However, our results suggest that problems encountered during pregnancy and childbirth
may aggravate the mother’s disturbance;

Pregnancy and Birth Complications

277

the number of reported PBCs was greater
among women with acute rather than
chronic disturbance.

Perhaps a more profitable direction for
future research would be the identification
of factors such as the nature and extent of
maternal life-event stress or anxiety which
are likely to affect the course of pregnancy
and childbirth (see Garmezy, 19746). It
would be much more useful to isolate the
psychological factors involved in the development of PBCs than to use rather imprecise diagnostic categories, the psychological meanings of which are still unclear.
It is also possible that the particular pregnancy and childbirth complications tabulated in this and other studies have little
relevance for the larger goal of isolating the
factors which are associated with the quality of the child’s subsequent adjustment,
but that other factors, not currently measured, might be more appropriate predictors. Information regarding this latter
possibility is not yet available, although
longitudinal research such as that reported
by Sameroff and Zax (1973a) may eventually be able to provide such information.
It is particularly important that we be able
to identify those children who subsequently
show psychopathology and to determine
which events from prenatal life to adulthood are associated with the development
of such psychopathology.
