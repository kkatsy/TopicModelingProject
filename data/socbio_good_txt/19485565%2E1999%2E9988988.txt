Structural Determinants of the Abortion Rate:
A Cross-societal Analysis

ABSTRACT: Data for a sample of 89 countries are used to examine societal-level predictors of the
legal status of abortion and its incidence as indicated by abortion rates. Measures of socioeconomic development, women’s labor force participation, and dominant religion are considered as
predictors of abortion. Logistic regression analysis reveals that socioeconomic development has
a positive effect on the probability of abortion being legal. Both a greater dominance of Catholicism and Islam in a society reduce the probability that abortion is legal. Results of tobit analyses
show that development has curvilinear effects on abortion rates, with lower rates of abortion at
both the lower and higher ends of development. Findings also indicate a positive effect of female
labor force participation on the abortion rate that initially grows stronger with increases in socioeconomic development, but weakens with further increases. Finally, a greater proportion of
Catholics in a population lowers the abortion rate.

The social and demographic characteristics of women who undergo abortion
are well documented for the United
States population (e.g., Henshaw et al.,
1991; Kochanek, 1991; Koonin et al.,
1995; Powell-Griner and Trent, 1987;
Trent and Powell-Griner, 1991) and for
many other national populations (for a
few of many examples see Baker and
Khasiani, 1992; Filicori and Flamigni,
1981; Li et al., 1990; Popov, 1991;
Skjeldestad and Borgan, 1994). These
studies examine abortion and its determinants within particular populations. Several very rich descriptive studies compare
societies and report considerable crossnational variation in the incidence of
abortion (e.g., David, 1983; Henshaw,
1990a, 1990b; Jones et al., 1986; Rolston
and Eggert, 1994; Tietze, 1981; Tietze
and Henshaw, 1986). Other studies focus
on national variation in abortion law

62

(e.g., Wasserman, 1983; United Nations,
1992, 1993, 1995). Multivariate analyses
of cross-societal variation in abortion are
noticeably underrepresented in this literature.

A more thorough understanding of
abortion differentials across national populations is important for medical, demographic, and public health reasons. For
example, from a medical standpoint, in
many countries abortion is one of the
most frequently performed surgical procedures (David, 1992). Abortion is also
one of the oldest and most widely used
methods of fertility control and is practiced today throughout the world, from
very remote rural to very large urban
populations (David, 1983; United Nations, 1992). Demographically, induced
abortion is clearly one of the proximate
determinants of fertility (Bongaarts and
Potter, 1983; Davis and Blake, 1956) and

has played, and continues to play, an important role in the maintenance or decline
of fertility levels in national populations
(David, 1983; Foreit, 1982; Frejka, 1983,
1985a). As Frejka (1983, 1985a) reports,
the effect of abortion on fertility is often
substantial, although less than the effect of
contraception. Importantly, from a public
health concern, induced abortion is also a
major cause of maternal mortality in
lesser-developed societies (Baretto et al.,
1992; David, 1983; Dixon-Mueller, 1990).

The purpose of this paper is to analyze
the structural determinants of abortion in
national populations. We use available
abortion data for a sample of 89 countries
to examine the net effects of socioeconomic development, women’s labor force
participation, and dominant religion on
both the legality and incidence of abortion. We are interested in the determinants of both policies regarding abortion
and the incidence of abortion. Although
the social and demographic context likely
affect both, those factors that influence
the legality of abortion may differ from
those that influence its frequency. For example, variation in the incidence of abortion is not solely due to differences in national abortion laws. Some observers note
that permissive abortion laws do not invariably Jead to a high incidence of abortion in those countries which lack restrictions (United Nations, 1992). No study, to
our knowledge, examines both the legality and incidence of abortion across societies both using a large sample and systematically explaining that variation
within a multivariate analytic framework.
In fact, the extant literature on crosssocietal variation in abortion is largely
descriptive. Theoretically, there is strong
justification to expect complex relationships between various national social in
 

Abortion Rate 63

dicators and abortion. However, no study
has empirically examined these expected
relationships.

THEORY

This study focuses on the societal context in which abortion occurs. General
theories of fertility behavior, and theoretical arguments and descriptive studies of
abortion, point to three particular structural aspects of societies that may be
salient for explaining national abortion
patterns: 1) socioeconomic development,
2) women’s status and female labor force
participation, and 3) religion.

SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND
ABORTION

The level of modernization or economic development of nations that correlate with higher standards of living is
central to explanations of national demographic variation and population change.
Although there are certainly varied patterns of fertility response to structural and
cultural change (Hirschman, 1994; McNicoll, 1992; Szreter, 1993), socioeconomic
development and fertility have been repeatedly linked in demographic research;
and measures of modernization are correlated with other aspects of family formation behavior as well (Mauldin and Berelson, 1978; Tolnay and Rodheaver, 1988;
South and Trent, 1988, as a few of many
examples). The nature of these relationships has attracted much research because
of its relevance to demographic transition
theory. There are several reasons to expect that socioeconomic development
will also affect the legality of abortion
and its incidence across societies.

Low levels of development might be
expected to coincide with the legalization

64 Trent and Hoskin

of, and liberal stance toward, abortion because of the state’s desire to slow rapid
population growth. Such conditions as
low levels of social and economic development and rapid population growth have
led to the adoption of many national family planning programs. However, such
motivations to curb population growth
via adoption of nonrestrictive abortion
policies actually have occurred in only a
few countries; the majority of countries
with liberal abortion laws are more developed countries with low birth rates (Tietze, 1981). Perhaps more important to
understanding variation in abortion law is
that the modernization process inherent
in social and economic development entails ideological and other value changes
(Kerckoff, 1972). To the extent that
modernity is reflected in more liberal legal codes, we should expect laws favoring abortion more likely in more developed rather than less developed countries,

The incidence of abortion should also
vary by level of socioeconomic development. As demographic transition theory
suggests, the modernization process can
affect fertility through numerous
processes as social, cultural, and economic change motivate persons to have
fewer children. Modernization entails a
variety of transformations which alter the
social and economic value of children;
among many other factors, mass education and media disperse values of small
family size (Caldwell, 1980). Moreover,
improved standards of living ensure more
children survive and fewer births are
needed to sustain desired family size
(Caldwell et al., 1992; Heer, 1966, 1983).
Thus, a prevailing argument is that children become more a financial liability
and less a social and economic asset (Bulatao, 1982; Caldwell, 1976, 1982; among

Social Biology

others). To the extent that expanded socioeconomic development lowers the
overall demand for children, we should
expect increases in the level of abortion
since voluntary termination serves as a
direct resolution for unwanted pregnancies and a means for maintaining desired
family size.

Social and economic development
should also be related to the availability of
abortion services, which, in turn, influence
abortion rates. Economic development and
urbanization are strongly related (Firebaugh, 1979; London, 1987, 1988); and
abortion services are concentrated in large
urban areas in many countries (Jones et
al., 1986). Women in less urban countries
may simply not have the resources or services available to them should they choose
to terminate a pregnancy.

Paradoxically, since social and economic development are also related to
greater availability and efficient use of
contraception, development should also
lower the demand for abortion by lower
Ing unwanted pregnancy rates (Jones et

al., 1986). Therefore, the relationship between abortion and socioeconomic development may well be curvilinear. At very
low levels of development, abortion
should be low because of the high demand and greater social and economic
value placed on children (Bulatao, 1982;
Caldwell, 1976, 1982; Ward, 1984). As
levels of development increase, abortion
rates should rise in concert with social
and economic pressures to limit family
size. At some threshold further increases
in development may be associated with a
leveling off or decline in abortion rates,
as efficient contraceptive behavior becomes more universal.

Indeed, several authors note that abortion is quite prevalent as women become

Vol. 46, No. 1-2

motivated to reduce their fertility but
have yet to adopt, or have available, efficient contraceptive technology (David,
1983; Foreit and Nortman, 1992; Popov,
1991). Women are less likely to use induced abortion when they are efficient
contraceptors (David, 1983; Foreit and
Nortman, 1992; Foreit, 1982). Although
there are exceptions, countries with low
fertility and high use of effective contraceptive methods have moderate to low
rates of induced abortion (Frejka, 1985b).
Henshaw (1990a, p. 88) argues that as
fertility declines abortion becomes more
common as does contraceptive use. However, at some point “contraceptive use becomes sufficiently widespread to cause
the abortion rate to fall, but many developing countries have yet to reach this
point.” Modernization, the desire to limit
family size, contraceptive use, and the
changing nature of abortion usage are inextricably related, and much research examines the relationships among most of
these variables. However, to our knowledge, the hypothesized curvilinear relationship between modernization and
abortion alluded to in some studies has
not been empirically verified in a crosssocietal analysis.

WOMEN’S STATUS, FEMALE LABOR
FORCE PARTICIPATION, AND ABORTION

The enhanced status of women likely
fosters a sociocultural environment in
which abortion is legal and more readily
accessible. In most societies issues of
women’s equality, reproductive freedom,
and access to safe and legal abortion are
closely intertwined philosophically and
politically (Luker, 1984). Therefore, national indicators of women’s status and
the legality of abortion should be correlated. In nations where women have

Abortion Rate 65

greater status, more social, political, and
economic autonomy, abortion laws are
likely not as restrictive as in societies in
which women’s lives are more socially
constrained.

Women’s status is also related to fertility behavior. Improvements in women’s
status loosen women’s reliance on men
for status and translate into potential additional roles to those traditional ones as
wives and mothers. Fertility declines as
women’s opportunities expand and they
begin to adopt and pursue these other
roles (Oppong, 1983). Again, the incidence of abortion should be higher as the
social and economic costs of children increase.

Women’s status is most often conceptualized in terms of economic power and
access to and control of resources (Mason, 1984). For example, women’s rate of
labor force participation is a very strong
predictor of women’s political status
(Oakes and Almquist, 1993). Therefore,
we might expect women’s rate of participation in the labor force to be correlated
with the legal status of abortion throughout the world.

Female labor force participation is
also related to fertility behavior. Research
on the relationship between female labor
force participation and fertility has been
of long-standing interest to social demographers (see review by Lehrer and Nerlove,
1986). A negative relationship between female labor force participation and fertility
has been found in studies in both industrialized and developing nations, although
that relationship tends to be weaker or
nonexistent in less developed countries
(Cramer, 1980; Gurak and Kritz, 1982;
Kasarda, 1971; Lehrer and Nerlove, 1986;
Mason, 1984; Standing, 1983). More specific to abortion behavior, a positive effect

66 Trent and Hoskin

of female labor force participation on
abortion rates holds at the aggregate level
in the United States (Borders and
Cutright, 1979). In general, then, we expect the level of women’s labor force participation to be positively correlated with
the abortion rate.

THE INTERACTION BETWEEN
SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND
WOMEN’S LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION

Importantly, the effect of female labor
force participation on the abortion rate
may vary by level of socioeconomic development. The effect of female labor
force participation on fertility is dependent on the type of work women do
(Lehrer and Nerlove, 1986; Mason, 1984;
Standing, 1978, 1983). The often inconsistent findings reported for the relationship between female labor force participation and fertility in cross-national
studies is thought to be due to the greater
extent of work activities in developing
countries that do not interfere with the
bearing and caring of children. Several
authors suggest that the nature of
women’s paid work in less developed
countries is more compatible with childbearing than women’s work in more developed societies (Gurak and Kritz, 1982;
Lehrer and Nerlove, 1986; Pampel and
Tanaka, 1986; Stycos and Weller, 1967;
Tilly and Scott, 1978; Ward, 1984). Paid
employment located in the home (such as
weaving or sewing labor) or elsewhere
where children may be taken along (such
as for some types of agricultural work)
allows women to more easily combine
the roles of mother and worker (Stycos
and Weller, 1967; Standing, 1983). Put
more simply, in less developed countries
children may pose less of a constraint on
women’s employment than in more de
Social Biology

veloped societies (Standing, 1978).
Therefore, the effect of female labor
force participation on abortion is likely
significantly stronger in more developed
nations where the type of work women
do creates more conflict between the
roles of mother and paid worker. Working
women in more developed countries may
find unwanted pregnancies entail comparatively greater costs and may therefore be
more likely to terminate a pregnancy.

RELIGION AND ABORTION

Much has been written on the relationships among religious ideology and culture, state policy, and social behavior
(e.g., Billings, 1990; Burns, 1990; Kulezycki, 1995; Luker, 1984; Misra and
Hicks, 1994). Religious codes and law
influence secular law and behavior regarding abortion (United Nations, 1992).
Religious law can affect behavior even in
societies where such laws are not part of
secular law or not enforced by the given
legal system (United Nations, 1992).
Therefore, the predominance of certain
religions likely plays an important role in
whether or not abortion is legal in a given
society and its incidence rate.

The Roman Catholic church strongly
opposes abortion (Kulczycki, 1995;
Luker, 1984; Staggenborg, 1989; Tietze,
1981, among others). Such opposition
may affect both the availability and use
of abortion within societies. We expect
nations with large Catholic populations
are less likely to legalize abortion. We
also expect abortion rates will be lower in
countries with larger Catholic populations. Although Catholics might not differ
from the general population in their abortion behavior as is currently reported for
the United States (see Henshaw and Kost,
1996), the per cent Catholic does signifi

Vol. 46, No. 1~2

cantly lower aggregate abortion rates as
observed for metropolitan-level abortion
rates in the U.S. (see Borders and
Cutright, 1979). Therefore, we suspect
that the relative proportion of Catholics in
countries will influence abortion outcomes.

Laws legalizing abortion should also
be less common in _ predominantly
Moslem countries; and abortion rates
should be lower than average in countries
with large Moslem populations. Islamic
law forbids the killing of the soul, but
there are various interpretations as to
when the fetus acquires a soul (Obermeyer, 1992; United Nations, 1992).
Some Islamic law forbids abortion prior
to quickening (when the fetus acquires a
soul), and some permits abortion prior to
quickening with justifiable grounds
(United Nations, 1992). Some Islamic
doctrines are less opposed to abortion,
and abortion laws are more relaxed in the
more modern Islamic countries (Henshaw, 1986). However, as Henshaw
(1986, p. 250) as well as others have
noted, in “the more strongly fundamentalist Islamic nations” there is very limited or no access to abortion services.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT AND
HYPOTHESES

Previous descriptive studies of abortion, and theoretical and empirical research on fertility behavior, point to three
major influences on the legal status and
rate of abortion across societies. In this
analysis, we build upon and extend other
studies by simultaneously examining the
effects of socioeconomic development,
women’s labor force participation, and
religion on abortion. More specifically,
we have the following objectives. First,
we examine the net effects of socioeco
 

Abortion Rate 67

nomic development, women’s labor force
participation, and the dominance of
Catholicism and Islam in countries on the
national legal status of abortion. Second,
we examine the net effects of socioeconomic development, women’s labor force
participation, and the dominance of
Catholicism and Islam in national populations on abortion rates. Third, we examine whether socioeconomic development
has curvilinear effects on the abortion
rate, and whether there is an interaction
effect between socioeconomic development and women’s labor force participation on the abortion rate.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The units of analysis for this study are
89 countries for which the requisite data
on the independent and dependent variables could be obtained. (The countries
used in the analysis are listed in Table 1.)
The data are all from the circa-1980 time
period. The sample includes both less and
more developed countries. The sample
captures 44 per cent of less developed
and 85 per cent of more developed countries as defined by the Population Reference Bureau (Population Reference Bureau, 1983). Not surprising, given
cross-national variation in data availability, the composition of our sample is
tilted toward more developed nations. A
comparison of our sample with a more
complete listing of countries (Population
Reference Bureau, 1983) shows our sample to have a similar mean life expectancy
(62 years in the more complete Population Reference Bureau sample versus 61
years in our sample), a lower mean infant
mortality rate (84 versus 68 in our sample), and a higher average level of urbanization (39 per cent versus 49 per cent in

68

our sample). The principal reason for
these differences is that only the more developed of “Third World” nations have
extensive and detailed national data available. Our sample is nonetheless large and
representative of nations from all major
regions of the world. Indeed, the sample
includes 25 African and 10 Middle Eastern nations. Countries from African and
Middle Eastern regions of the world are
typically underrepresented in cross-societal analyses.

Two dependent variables are used because we are interested in both the legal
status of abortion and the extent to which
women obtain abortions. The first is a dichotomous variable indicating whether
abortion is legal or not (1 = legal, 0 = not
legal).' Abortion is legal in 37 per cent of
the countries in the sample. The second,

‘Determining at what point abortion may be deemed
legal in a society is often not clear-cut. For example, in
countries where abortion is illegal, “abortion to save a
woman’s life may be authorized under general principles of criminal law (state of necessity)” (Tietze, 1981,
p. 17). In other countries, abortion js legal, but only for
medical grounds that are narrowly defined, usually to
save the life of the mother (Tietze, 1981). Since neither
type of society represented in our sample provides data
on the number of abortions, and abortion in both types
of countries is likely rare, both types are defined in this
analysis as “not legal” and are censored in the subsequent tobit analysis. In Mexico, Brazil, and Ecuador
abortion is only legal to save the life of the mother and
only for judicial reasons in the case of rape or incest
(Tietze, 1981). In El Salvador, Malaysia, and Turkey,
abortion is legal only for the above reasons and for eugenic (fetal) grounds and generally only permitted prior
to the viability of the fetus (Tietze, 1981). Abortion data
are not available for these six countries, and they have
also been classified in this analysis as “not legal” cases
and are censored in the tobit analysis. In all other countries categorized as “legal” for this analysis, abortion is
legal without specified grounds (on demand) or for social, social-medical, and other grounds (Tietze, 1981).
The classification used in this study is unlikely to affect
the tobit analysis because countries where abortion is illegal without registered counts, or legal and rare without official counts, or legal and rare with very low registered counts will be weighted quite similarly in the tobit
analysis.

Trent and Hoskin

 

Social Biology

the General Abortion Rate (GAR) is defined as the number of legal abortions per
1,000 women of reproductive age (ages
15-44) (Tietze 1981). The General Abortion Rate is preferable to a Crude Abortion
Rate (the number of abortions per 1,000
population) because it is less affected by
the age and sex structure of a population.’
Among countries in which abortion is legal (i.e., that have non-zero GARs), the
General Abortion Rate in our sample
varies from a low of 0.1 in Botswana and
South Africa to a high of 181.0 in the
USSR (see Table 1). All data on the legal
status and incidence of abortion used in
this study are taken from Tietze (1981),
Tietze and Henshaw (1986) and, in a few
cases, the United Nations Demographic
Yearbook (United Nations, 1982).

We should note that the abortion rate,
one of the dependent variables in this
study, is difficult to measure. The actual
number of abortions performed throughout the world in a given year is unknown
(David, 1983). In many countries abortion is illegal, but abortions nonetheless
occur. Obviously, “research is most representative, valid, and reliable in countries where abortion is legal” and registered (David, 1983, p. 196). Therefore,
our measure of abortion rates is based on
legally obtained abortions. Importantly,
the empirical analysis of the determinants
of the abortion rate using tobit models
(described below) takes into account
cases where abortion is not legal.

Alternative measures of abortion are, nonetheless,
highly correlated with the General Abortion Rate. The
General Abortion Rate and the Crude Abortion Rate are
nearly perfectly correlated (r = 0.999, N = 33). The
General Abortion Rate and the Abortion Ratio (per
1,000 live births) are also highly correlated (r = 0.98, N
= 32). And the General Abortion Rate and another
Abortion Ratio (per 1,000 known pregnancies) are also
highly correlated (r = 0.89, N = 32).

*The countries without an entry under “Rate” are those in which abortion is not legal.

Four independent variables are included in the models predicting the legal
status of abortion and the abortion rate.
The first independent variable considered
is a measure of each nation’s level of so
cioeconomic development. We performed
an exploratory factor analysis of three
common development indicators—the infant mortality rate, life expectancy at
birth, and the per cent of the population

that is urban (Population Reference Bureau, 1983). All three variables loaded
highly on a single factor. These variables
were transformed into standard scores
and summed to give an index of socioeconomic development. The reliability of
this index, as measured by Cronbach’s alpha ts high (alpha = 0.94). The socioeconomic development index ranges from a
minimum of 0.1 in Upper Volta to a maximum of 10.1 in Hong Kong with a mean
of 6.0.7

The second independent variable is
women’s labor force participation measured as the percentage of adult women
defined as economically active by the International Labour Office (Population
Reference Bureau, 1981).* Although the
conceptual and methodological difficulties in measuring women’s labor force
participation are often noted (Dixon,
1982; Durand, 1974; Mason, 1986), this
particular measure is frequently used in
cross-national studies (e.g., South and
Trent, 1988) and correlates highly with
alternative operationalizations (Pampel
and Tanaka, 1986). In this sample, the female labor force participation rate has a
mean of 40.8 per cent and ranges from a
low of 4 per cent in both Mauritania and
Iraq to a high of 86 per cent in Rwanda.

3A constant of “6” was added to scores on the socioeconomic development index so that all scores
would be positive and make the subsequent analysis
and presentation of results more straightforward.

‘The International Labour Office (1977) includes
“among the economically active population or labour
force all persons who contribute to the supply of labour
for the production of economic goods and services, ie.,
all employed persons (employers, persons working on
their own account, salaried employees, wage earners, unpaid family workers, members of producer co-operatives
and armed forces) and all the unemployed (both those
with previous job experience and those seeking work for
the first time).”

The final two independent variables
capture the dominance of Catholicism
and Islam in national populations. The
first variable estimates the percentage of
the population identified as Roman
Catholic (Kurian, 1979). The per cent
Catholic in our sample ranges from a low
of O per cent (less than 1 per cent) in
Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan,
Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and
Bulgaria, to a high of over 95 per cent in
the Dominican Republic, El Salvador,
Malta, and Spain, with a mean of 32.5
per cent. The second variable 1s a dummy
variable representing predominantly
Moslem nations (Maudlin and Berelson,
1978; Kurian, 1979). Twenty-two countries in our sample are identified as predominantly Moslem.

The analysis proceeds by first presenting descriptive statistics and bivariate
correlations for the variables used in the
analysis. We then use logistic regression
to analyze the effects of the independent
variables on the dichotomous variable
measuring the legal status of abortion.
Tobit analysis is then used to analyze the
effects of the independent variables on
the abortion rate.

Tobit analysis is an appropriate statistical method for analyzing data with censored dependent variables (Roncek,
1992). A tobit model is the most appropriate method of analysis for predicting
abortion rates since we have a classic sit
‘The 22 countries identified as predominantly
Moslem are: Egypt, Libya, Sudan, Tunisia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Somalia, Chad, Iraq,
Kuwait, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syna, Turkey, South
Yemen, Iran, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Malaysia. We
should also note that the dominance of Islam in a society is measured as a dummy variable and not as a percentage of the population (as we measure the dominance of Catholicism) because our major source of data
provides the information in this manner.

uation in which there is a censored dependent variable—abortions are observed
for cases where abortion is legal and
abortions are not observed for cases
where abortion is not legal. Actual values
of abortion rates are not observed for 63
per cent of the cases in our sample because abortion is illegal in those countries. Abortion is registered in only 33
countries in our sample. Therefore, the
abortion rate does not take on values for
56 cases. Tobit analysis allows us to determine the effect of the independent
variables on cases above the threshold
(countries with non-zero values for the
abortion rate), factoring in the characteristics of countries without values. Thus,
tobit analysis avoids the bias incurred by
only examining the determinants of the
abortion rate (using OLS regression)
among countries in which abortion is not
censored. Tobit analysis, in essence, allows us to control for cases in which
abortion is not legal.

RESULTS

LEGAL STATUS OF ABORTION

Table 2 presents the correlation matrix
and descriptive statistics for the variables
used in the analysis. As expected, at the
bivariate level higher levels of development are associated with abortion being
legal (r = 0.59). Abortion is more likely
legal in countries with higher female labor force ‘participation rates (r = 0.30).

Also as expected, abortion is less likely to
be legal in countries with large Catholic
populations and in predominantly Moslem countries (r = —0.20 and r = —0.39,
respectively). .

Table 3 presents the results from the
logistic regression analysis of the legal

status of abortion. The coefficients in the
table refer to the relationship between the
independent variables and the log odds of
abortion being legal. The development index has a positive effect on whether abortion is legal. As predicted, higher levels
of development increase the likelihood of
abortion being legal in a nation. Although
in the predicted direction, the female labor force participation rate does not have
a significant effect on the legality of abortion after controlling for other national
social indicators. As expected, both a
larger percentage of Catholics in a population and the predominance of Islam significantly lower the likelihood of abortion
being legal in a country.°

THE ABORTION RATE

Table 4 presents the results of the tobit
analysis for the General Abortion Rate.
Since the final tobit model is difficult to
interpret, we proceed in steps. The coefficients for Equation 1, the baseline model,
show that all the variables in the model,
except “Moslem country,” have significant effects. Equation 2 tests for the predicted curvilinear effect of socioeconomic development. Inclusion of the
squared term (which is significant) in
Equation 2 significantly improves the
baseline model (comparing Equation 2 to
Equation 1, as indicated by the change in
chi-square). As predicted, the effect of
development is curvilinear and takes on
an inverted U-shape; at low levels of development, a unit increase in development increases the GAR, while at higher

‘Indeed, legalized abortion is 98 per cent less likely
in predominantly Moslem countries (e~*°!2), The magnitude of this effect reflects the fact that in 1980 abortion was legal in only one out of the 22 Moslem countries in our sample.

development decreases the GAR.’
Equation 3 tests for the predicted interaction effect between the development index and the female labor force participation rate by adding the interaction term to
the baseline model. That interaction is
significant. The addition of the interaction
term to the model results in a significant
improvement over the baseline model
(Equation 3 compared to Equation 1, as
indicated by the change in chi-square).
The final model (Equation 4) includes
the squared term for the development in
An inverted U-shaped relationship is indicated by a
positive coefficient for the independent variable in its
original metric and by a negative coefficient for the
squared values of that variable (Stolzenberg, 1979).

in a significant improvement over the earlier comparison model (Equation 2, as indicated by the change in chi-square). The

The nature of these effects on the
abortion rate is complex and difficult to
interpret simply by viewing the tobit
coefficients reported in Table 4. A common mistake made when interpreting
tobit coefficients is to assume they are
effects of the independent variables on
the dependent variable for cases that
are above the limit, when, in fact, these
tobit coefficients provide information
on two types of effects—the effects of
the independent variables on values
falling below the threshold and the effects of the independent variables on
values falling above the threshold (McDonald and Moffitt, 1980; Roncek,
1992). It is the latter group of effects
that are of interest here and that we discuss below.

Therefore, we derive and present in
Table 5 unit change estimates for abortion

values above the threshold derived from
the tobit analysis reported in Table 4,
Equation 4 (see Roncek, 1992). These
estimates show how a unit increase for a
given independent variable changes the
abortion rate in those countries where
abortion is observed (Roncek, 1992).
For example, the results reported in
Table 5 show that a unit increase in the
percentage Catholic implies an expected
decrease of 1.641 in the abortion rate in
countries where abortion is observed.
The estimates presented in Table 5 are
used to derive figures that more clearly
illustrate the nonlinear/nonadditive effect of socioeconomic development and
the nonadditive effect of female labor
force participation on the abortion rate.
Figure 1 illustrates the changing effect of female labor force participation
on the abortion rate at varying levels of

development.® In other words, Figure 1
demonstrates how the effect of female labor force participation on abortion varies
at different levels of development. As
predicted, the effect of female labor force
participation on abortion is positive. This
figure also shows that the positive effect
of female labor force participation on
abortion initially grows stronger with increases in development, with the positive
effect remaining but diminishing with
further increases in development. These
findings lend partial support to our original hypothesis. For scores falling approximately below 6.52 on the development
index, our initial theoretical argument
holds, suggesting that the effect of female
labor force participation is stronger in
more developed nations where the type of

‘Figure 1 is derived by applying the unit change estimates provided in Table 5 to the following equation.
The effect of female labor force participation, b*, at
different levels of development is derived from:

Y=a+b,X, + bX, + bjX,X, + b,X,(X,)
where X, = Female labor force participation rate and
X, = socioeconomic development. (Note that the main
effect of the squared term is omitted for simplicity.)
Therefore,

b* = b, + bX, + bX,
(see Stolzenberg, 1979). We should note that holding
other variables constant at their mean, the predicted
value of abortion becomes “O” when the development
index reaches 5.52. The graph depicted in Figure 1
starts at that point.

work women do creates more conflict between the roles of mother and paid
worker. However, for higher than average
levels of development (scores falling approximately above 6.52—slightly above
the mean) further increases in development weaken the positive effect of female
Jabor force participation on abortion, suggesting perhaps that the roles of mother
and paid worker become less conflicted
as nations become even more developed.
Perhaps in more highly developed nations
more liberal work policies for women are
adopted and institutionalized child care is
more widely available and thus the potential conflict between the roles of mother
and worker is weakened. Also, in these
highly developed countries contraceptive
use presumably would be at its highest
level and thus. unwanted pregnancy rates
would be at their lowest. Importantly, the
overall effect of female labor force participation on abortion is positive. Higher
rates of female labor force participation
are related to higher rates of abortion.
However, that positive effect grows
weaker at higher than average levels of
socioeconomic development.

development at varying levels of female
labor force participation, taking into account both the curvilinear effect of development and the interaction effect between

of female labor force participation on socloeconomic development’s effect (at the
development index’s mean, and one standard deviation below and above the
mean) at values ranging between the first
and ninth deciles of female labor force
participation. This figure illustrates that
the effect of development on the abortion
rate becomes progressively stronger with
higher levels of female labor force participation, and that the overall effect of development on the abortion rate is greater
with increases in development.

*Figure 2 is derived by applying the unit change estimates provided in Table 5 to the following equation.
The effect of socioeconomic development, b*, at different levels of female labor force participation is derived
from:

Y= a+ bX, + b,(X,)? + b,X,X, + bX, PX,

simplicity.) Therefore,

b* = b, + 2b,X, + (0, + b,)X,
(see Stolzenberg, 1979).

Although Figure 2 illustrates the interaction between development and female
labor force participation, this figure does
not illustrate the curvilinear nature of the
relationship between development and
the abortion rate. To illustrate this, Figure
3 shows the relationship between socioeconomic development and abortion for
two values of female labor force participation (when female labor force participation is at its mean and one standard deviation above its mean), holding the
religion variables constant at their
means.” Thus, Figure 3 illustrates the
predicted values of abortion at different
levels of socioeconomic development. At
low levels of development the abortion
rate is low; with increases in development, the abortion rate rises; then with
further increases in development, the
abortion rate begins to fall. This pattern

supports the argument that at very low
levels of development, abortion is low
because of the high demand and greater
social and economic value placed on children. As levels of development increase,
abortion rates rise in concert with social
and economic pressures to limit family
size. At some threshold further increases
in development are associated with a leveling off or decline in abortion rates presumably as efficient contraceptive behavior becomes more universally practiced
in a population.

CONCLUSION

By considering the combined effects
of development, female labor force participation, and religion on abortion, we
have examined the net effects of factors
theoretically associated with abortion, but
not previously demonstrated empirically.
In a sample of 89 more developed and
less developed countries, we have shown
that these social forces exert significant
influence on the legal status of abortion
and its incidence rate, although in different ways. The multi-item development
index bears a significant relationship to
the probability of abortion being legal
and also to the abortion rate. The female
labor force participation rate does not
have a significant effect on the legal status of abortion, but does significantly affect the abortion rate. Both the development index and the female labor force
participation rate exhibit complex relationships to the abortion rate. Increases in
social and economic development appear
to initially increase the rate of abortion,
but ultimately lower the incidence of
abortion. Female labor force participation
has a positive effect on abortion rates, although the effect grows weaker at higher
than average levels of socioeconomic de
Abortion Rate 77

velopment. The percentage Catholic in
national populations significantly affects
both the legal status of abortion and its
rate. Abortion is overwhelmingly less
likely to be legal in Moslem countries
than in other countries.

It is interesting to note that the labor
force activity of women exerts a significant influence on abortion rates, but has
no significant effect on the legal status of
abortion. It appears that the labor force
activity of women influences the more
private fertility behaviors of women, but
does not affect the more public arena of
state policy regarding abortion. The legal
status of abortion appears to be more a
reflection of the level of modernization in
a society rather than any level of structural power held by women.

Future studies might profitably attempt to corroborate the findings of this
analysis by investigating the relationship
between socioeconomic development and
women’s labor force participation on
abortion within particular populations,
for other time periods, and over time.
Since the conclusions of this study are
based on cross-sectional data, investigating the nature of these complex relationships over time would be a particularly
fruitful direction of research. For example, it may be that high levels of abortion
increase women’s labor force activity
(because women’s domestic labor is reduced) rather than the reverse relationship assumed in this study, that high rates
of female labor force participation increase abortion. A longitudinal research
design could better address the causal relationship between women’s labor force
participation and abortion rates.

Future research should also explore
the relationships among socioeconomic
development, women’s labor force participation, contraceptive use, and abortion.

A limitation of this study is our inability
to control for the extent of contraceptive
use in the nations under study. Contraceptive use data are only available for
about half of the countries in our sample.
And, among those few countries with
contraceptive use data, contraceptive use
is very highly correlated with socioeconomic development. Therefore, we cannot determine how much of the effect of
socioeconomic development on the abortion rate is due to the reduced value of
having children or to women’s access and
adoption of contraceptive technology.

Our study also suggests that the nature of
work in different societies has varying implications for women, and in that sense
other indicators of women’s status beyond
their labor force participation may be
needed to understand the effects of women’s
status on national abortion legal codes. For
example, the political power necessary to
make abortion legal may be more associated
with women’s level of education and their
political presence than their labor force activity. Future studies should explore multidimensional factors of women’s status and relate these to abortion law.

Finally, while our findings on the effect of Catholicism on abortion may not
be surprising, future studies should explore in greater detail the relationship between the predominance of Catholicism
and abortion. As mentioned earlier, in
some countries, such as the United
States, there is little difference between
the abortion behavior of Catholics and
non-Catholics. As one reviewer suggested, there may be an interaction effect
between socioeconomic development and
the predominance of Catholicism on the
rate of abortion. For example, countries
relatively high percentages of

Trent and Hoskin

Social Biology

Catholics and lower levels of socioeconomic development may have significantly lower rates of abortion than countries with high percentages of Catholics
and higher levels of development. It may
well be that the level of modernization
tempers the influence of Catholic doctrine on abortion behavior. Indeed, it is
generally thought that religion becomes
more individualistic and less doctrinaire
as societies economically develop and
modemize (e.g., Bellah, 1970).

In sum, this study provides a theoretical
framework for explaining cross-national
abortion patterns developed from descriptive studies of abortion and from more general comparative theories of fertility behavior and closely examines cross-national
variation in abortion using more sophisticated multivariate analytic techniques than
any previous study. The analysis and results presented here suggest that prior research on national level abortion rates has
not clearly established the complexities of
the dual influence of socioeconomic development and women’s labor force participation on abortion and, thus, perhaps oversimplifies the nature of cross-national
variation in abortion. Our results suggest,
at the very least, that the relationships between a society’s level of development, the
labor force activity of women, and abortion
rates are rather complex, and simple linear
associations cannot be presumed.
