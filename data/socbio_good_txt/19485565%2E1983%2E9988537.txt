ABSTRACT: Methods for assessing the gain of life expectancy by reducing the risks of death are
examined. Depending on the method used, overestimation and underestimation of life expectancy may occur. Although the gain in life expectancy is not a linear function of the per cent
reduction in mortality, a linear approximation may be used when the mortality rate is low.
When the mortality rate is high, linear approximations tend to overestimate the years gained. A
method using the parameter H developed by Keyfitz (1977) is adequate for low mortality rates
such as with neoplasms. However, when mortality rates are high, as they are for
cardiovascular-renal diseases (CVD), Keyfitz’s method tends to underestimate the gain in life
expectancy. For CVD, Keyfitz’s estimation is adequate below the 20 per cent reduction range.
The magnitude of overestimation and underestimation are numerically evaluated based on the

1964 United States male mortality statistics.

Methods of projecting the effects of
eradicating a cause of death in a population of a community date back to the
middle 1700’s. At that time consideration was given to the impact the eradication of smallpox would have on the
composition of the population. Early
studies by D. Bernoulli and D’Alembert
led Duvillard to the estimation that, ‘if
smallpox disappeared, a new-born child
would, on an average, gain three and a
half years in expectation of life’ (Westergard, 1932). Consequently, the goal
became the total eradication of particular infectious diseases.

Today, when chronic diseases play a
major role in mortality, the goal has
shifted toward reductions (partial eliminations) rather than eradications (total
eliminations) for causes of death. This
shift from total elimination to partial
elimination for a cause of death may be
of interest not only to demographers
and health planners but also to the general public. Concurrent with the previ
ously mentioned shift is a trend in the
declining mortality among diseases of
the heart, cerebrovascular diseases, and
accidents (Breslow, 1979; Tsai et al.,
1982). For example, the U.S. population between 1968 and 1975 demonstrated that the decline in the ageadjusted death rate was 20 per cent for
diseases of the heart, 25 per cent for
cerebrovascular diseases, and 19 per
cent for accidents (Tsai et al., 1982).

In this paper, methods are presented
for assessing the relative impact on life
expectancy associated with a reduction
in the risk of dying from a particular
cause of death. A stochastic approach to
the problem of competing risks of death
is used. This approach is compared to a
method developed by Keyfitz (1977).
Numerical comparisons are made based
on the 1964 male mortality statistics for
cardiovascular-renal diseases (CVD),
neoplasms, and motor vehicle accidents
(MVA).

REDUCTION IN A COMPETING
RISK OF DEATH

In the subsequent results, we have
adopted the notation used by Chiang
(1968). The mortality intensity associated with cause Rs is (45). We assume
that the total mortality intensity is additive so that

n(t) = 2, (458),

Then the expectation of life at birth is

£5 = [Pon] _ [ (7) ar| dt.

The effect of reducing the risk of
death from cause R, by a proportion 7
of its original value gives an expectation
of life at birth of

e9°(z) = {°{exp| - [he

— TAT; | ar) at.

The corresponding gain in the expectation of life is

This last relationship expresses the gain
in expectation of life as a linear function
of the gain that would be attained if
cause R, were completely eliminated as
a risk of death. Equation (2) will lead to
an overestimation of the years gained as
can be seen in the next section. If
ari(t;8) is small for all values of t, the approximation is quite adequate.

EXAMINATION OF THREE
LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH

In order to compare our results with
those of Keyfitz (1977), the methods in
the previous section have been applied
to the United States male mortality statistics for 1964. Figure 1 gives the added
years of life at birth associated with a 100
a per cent reduction in CVD, neoplasms, and MVA. These calculations
were carried out using Equation (1), the
exact expression for

e9(77) ~ ep.

More detailed results based on the
1969-71 mortality statistics for the U.S.
populations are given elsewhere by Tsai
et al. (1978).

From Figure 1 it can easily be seen
that for both neoplasms and MVA the
linear approximatin in Equation (2)
would be quite adequate. However, for
CVD the linear approximations would
lead to a considerable overestimation
for

e5(77) ~ ey.

Actual numerical comparisons are
shown in Table 1 for the three approaches: the ‘“‘exact method” in Equation (1); the linear approximations in
Equation (2); and the method using the
parameter H®. The linear approxima

tion is grossly inadequate for CVD. For
example, in a 10 per cent reduction of
CVD, the linear approximation overestimates the gain in expectation of life by
approximately 90 per cent. In a 30 per
cent reduction of CVD there is an overestimation of nearly 70 per cent. Conversely, the estimates based on the parameter H are adequate within a 20
per cent reduction range for CVD and
the entire reduction range for neoplasms and MVA.

Figure 2 further compares these three
approaches for CVD. The estimate using the parameter Hl is analogous to
taking a tangent at a very small per cent
reduction of CVD. It can be linearly extrapolated up to about a 20 per cent re
duction level. Beyond this level Keyfitz’s method would lead to an
underestimation.

Calculations according to Equation
(1) are more tedious when compared to
the approximation in Equation (2). The
same is true for calculations of H® values. The linear approximation is more
convenient for computation but gives
appropriate results only if one is accumulating small reductions in each of the
competing causes or only for causes
which make a small contribution to the
total mortality.

life expectancy associated with a partial
reduction of certain causes of death can
be approximated by a convenient linear
function when the mortality rate is as
small as it is for neoplasms, the second
leading cause of death today in the
United States. For CVD, the first leading cause of death, this linear approximation tends to overestimate the added
years of life. Consequently, the linear
approximation should not be used in this
type of calculation for public health policy analysis. While estimates based on a
convenient parameter developed by
Keyfitz are adequate within a 20 per
cent reduction range for CVD, they
tend to overestimate beyond this range.
The “exact method” should especially

be used for CVD, in view of the continuing downward trend in diseases of the
heart, combined with the need to examine the effect of the downward trend for
long periods of time.

A practical method to approximate
the exact line for partial elimination on
the cause of death when the mortality
rate is high is to calculate the gain in life
expectation at a 50 per cent elimination
and a 100 per cent elimination. Connecting these two points, and the 50 per cent
point with the origin, gives a good estimation for the curve. This method gives
a reasonable approximation for CVD.

When the appropriate formula is
used, it should also be noted that the basic assumption of independence among
