CT: The proportion of persons of a given racial/ethnic group in the population seems

ikely to influence the probability that members of that group marry persons of other racial/
thnic groups, while median income does not. However, among individuals who do marry crossthnically, the median income levels of other groups has a substantial association with the probability of occurrence of difference possible combinations of cross-ethnic matings. _

S Marriage generally involves “like
Smarries like”—homogamous assorta“tive mating. Homogamy tends to be
very substantial for age and for race, rel‘satively strong for such attributes as pa-=tental educational and occupational sta.=tus, one’s own educational and occupational status, height, and cognitive abilsity, and weak—though still present—
‘awith regard to personality (see Vandenberg, 1972; Jensen, 1978, for reviews of
Ethe literature on assortative mating. )
‘>, Cross-racial/ethnic matings are of in“terest since they run counter to the very
Speneral tendency toward homogany.
Swhile they are increasing on the U.S.
zmainiand, they still are only about one
Aper cent of all matings of white, black,
and ‘“‘other nonwhite” groups (the thoroughly inadequate system of categorization used in the 1970 U.S. census; see
Reiss, 1980, p. 333). Data from the 1980
census still are unavailable’. In Hawaii,
the proportion of out-marriage has been
very high ever since the discovery of the
islands by non-Polynesians. It has been

suggested (e.g., Lind, 1980) that this
high rate of marriage across races and
ethnic groups in Hawaii results from a
historic tradition of acceptance of such
marriages and from the disproportionate number of male to female tmmigrants to Hawaii among many groups.

Also of obvious importance is the
racial/ethnic mix. During the years
1975-77 the per cent of various ethnic
groups in the population, for the five
larger racial/ethnic groups was: Caucasian, 27.5 per cent, Chinese, 4.8 per
cent, Filipino, 10.7 per cent, Hawaiian/
Part Hawatian, 17.0 per cent, and Japanese, 25.9 per cent (Lind, 1980, p. 30).
Additional smaller groups listed separately in State of Hawaii population data
include Puerto Ricans, Koreans, Samoans, Blacks, and Vietnamese. Given this
diversity, it is far more likely for a Hawaii resident to meet, fall in love with,
and marry someone of another group
than it would be for someone in most
other regions to do so. Further, these
groups vary less in socioeconomic status
or in prestige than probably in the case
elsewhere. Relative similarity in status
might be expected to lead to a higher
rate of cross-group marriages.

The purpose of the present paper is
to further analyze already published
data in order to assess the associations of
ethnic group size and of median ethnic
group income with per cents of crossethnic marriages and, among crossethnic marriages, per cents of the different combinations of marriages of each of
the five major racial/ethnic groups in
Hawaii. The analysis provides information regarding possible bases of differential within/across group mating as well
as the bases of differential cross-group
matings to members of various racial/
ethnic groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Analyses presented herein have to do
with marriages occurring in the years
1975-77, the most recent years (so far as
the writer can ascertain) for which both
marriage and income data are available
in sufficient detail to permit the analyses
to be done. Data are from Lind concerning group size (1980, p. 30), median
group income (1980, p. 106), and marriage (1980, p. 116).

These analyses are limited to the five
largest racial/ethnic groups, persons of
Caucasian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese,
and Hawaiian/Part Hawaiian ancestries.
Lind also included data regarding other,
smaller racial/ethnic groups. ‘These data
are not used in the analyses since the
groups are quite small; the largest, persons of Korean ancestry, formed 1.2 per
cent of the 1975-77 population.

Several problems exist with regard to
these data. Population figures are for all
members of each group, not just those
persons of marriageable age, and this
clearly introduces some error. A more
major problem has to do with the actual
numbers of members of each group reported. These data have to do with resi

dent and also nonresident marriages.
There is a large military presence in Hawaii. There were about fifty thousand
military personnel plus over sixty thousand military dependents in 1970 (see
Lind, p. 9 and p. 30); these numbers almost certainly were as high or higher in
the years 1975~77 that form the basis of
the present analysis. In addition, between two and three million tourists visited Hawaii each year during this time
period. The vast majority of the military, military dependents, and tourists
are of Caucasian ancestry. While tourists (nonresidents) and persons living in
military barracks are not included in the
population figures shown below, military and their dependents living in the
community are included, thus inflating
the proportion of Caucasians in the population. All marriages are included, thus
further inflating the proportions of Caucasians as compared to members of
other groups getting married.

Since persons of Caucasian and of
Japanese ancestry are close to equal in
numbers of residents not living in barracks, but the number of Caucasians
marrying is about three times as large
(see Table 1 below), it seems clear that
short-time residents or visitors of Caucasian ancestry make up the majority of
Caucasian marriages. These would
seem likely to be the persons least likely
to marry across racial/ethnic groups.
The frequency of marriage would be
sharply reduced and the rate of crossgroup marriage of Caucasians increased
if marriage data had only to do with only
relatively permanent residents of Hawaii. Schwertfeger (1982, p. 53), studying marriages of only Hawaii civilian
residents married in 1968, found that
48.3 per cent of Caucasian women and
47.2 per cent of Caucasian men married
persons of other ethnic groups. The

present data are badly flawed with regard to the proportion of cross-ethnic
matings of Caucasian residents; even so,
the relative frequencies of different
kinds of cross-ethnic matings of Caucasians with others is of major interest. In
this respect (as will be seen below) the
Caucasian data are consonant with
those of other groups.

RESULTS

Ingroup vs. outgroup marriage data
are presented in Table 1 separately, by
ethnicity, for males and for females.

Groups are ordered in terms of median
income, from Chinese (highest) to Hawaiian/Part Hawaiian (lowest).

This is a closed system, since it addresses only within-group matings and
matings to members of the four other
groups. The total number of withingroup marriages is 17,388, and the total
number of outmarriages of persons of
those five groups to members of the
Other four groups is 8,286, for both
males and for females. However, the
numbers of males and of females of any
group marrying persons of any other
group vary. Therefore, analyses pre

greatly reduced as a result of the uncertain but probably large number of
within-group marriages of military persons, their dependents, and of visitors to
Hawaii included in the Caucasian marriage group. However, this unavoidable
problem should not greatly influence the
differential outmarriage rates of the
Caucasians to members of the four
other groups. Table 1 indicates that
probability of outmarriage is not consistently related to group income; Chinese (highest median income) and persons of Hawaiian/Part Hawaiian ancestry (lowest median income) show the
highest percentages of outmarriage.
The number of persons making up given
groups does seem to play a role; larger
groups have lower outmarriage rates.
Since 19 of 20 potential marriage partners a person of Chinese ancestry meets
are of another racial/ethnic group, as
compared with about 2 in 3 for persons

of Caucasian or of Japanese ancestry, it
is not surprising that the Chinese outmarry more often. As may be discerned
in Tables 2, 3, and 4, who marries whom
appears to be closely associated with
group income level; outmarriages to
members of groups similar to one’s own
in income are over-represented and to
dissimilar income groups underrepresented, with this tendency somewhat greater for women than men.

An East-West split into intergroup
marriage has been suggested to exist
(Parkman and Sawyer, 1967), with persons of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
ancestries on the one hand, and persons
of Caucasian, Hawaiian/Part Hawaiian,
Filipino, and Puerto Rican ancestries on
the other hand, tending to intermarry.
Data having to do with persons of Korean or of Puerto Rican ancestry are not
included herein because the groups are
so small in numbers (10,136 Koreans

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 31, No. 1-2

and 4,695 Puerto Ricans in 1977; Lind,
1980, p. 30). Data presented herein are
somewhat supportive of an East-West
split, since there is a substantial overrepresentation of Chinese-Japanese intermarriage, and an _ underrepresentation of marriages of Japanese
men and Caucasian women. However,
marriages of Caucasian grooms with
brides of Chinese ancestry also are overrepresented. Ifa true East-West split existed as a result of cultural affinities, one
would expect Filipinos to be more like
persons of Asian as opposed to nonAsian ancestry in terms of marriage patterns, but they are not. In fact, in the
Parkman and Sawyer analysis Filipinos
and Puerto Ricans are more representative of the West than are Caucasians.
Further, one would expect this supposed cultural affinity to be equally
present for both sexes, while the data
show substantial sex differences in marriage patterns. One can wonder, too,
about the actual cultural affinity of persons of Asian ancestry; culturally
defined sex roles probably vary more
between Chinese and Japanese than between either of these groups and Cauca

sians. Finally, it should be noted, that
the rank order correlation between
‘“Eastern-ness” and group income for
the seven groups (with Hawaiians and
Part-Hawaiians combined in this correlation) studied by Parkman and Sawyer
is 0.75.

Obviously, ability to delay gratification, self-discipline, and placing a high
value on education are themselves cultural variables and would be expected to
differ between groups varying in
achievement. On this level, one would
expect cultural differences between
groups to be reflected in income levels
and expect that groups of similar income
levels more often have shared values
than groups dissimilar in income. Differences in income do not exist in a vacuum, and it seems probable that the cultural attributes likely to lead to a given
level of income, rather than income per
se, influences the probability of persons
marrying members of given racial/ethnic
groups other than their own. Group income reflects many other attributes of
groups; however, group income in its
own right is a good predictor of patterns
of inter-racial/ethnic marriage.
