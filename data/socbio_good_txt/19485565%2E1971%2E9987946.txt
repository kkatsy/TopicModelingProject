How to Get Along Without Race

in Demographic Analysis

PART 1: MALADY

It is, no doubt, of immense functional
value to our society to have such a mass
of black-and-white information at our
fingertips as the census provides. Without
the slightest hesitation or thought, governmental agencies know exactly where their
ameliorative programs must go, sociologists
know where to find their laboratories, and
bankers know where to avoid lending
money. We have learned that when we
locate the blacks we locate the centers of
poverty with all of their evils, and therefore charting the distribution of blackness
provides an extremely useful correlate of
many of the things we need to know how
to avoid (Schmid, MacCannell, and Van
Arsdol, 1958; Hoult and Mayer, 1969).
Thus, the collective wisdom of the Department of Commerce, the Bureau of the
Budget, and the Population Association
of America has brought forth stability and
order in an otherwise chaotic world. However, it has required vigilance, and the

1“An additional continuum is suggested for the
Negro population, which has become associated
more closely with the socio-economic cluster of
measures” (Schmid, MacCannell, and Van Arsdol,
Jr., 1958, p. 401).

 

 

PAA has done its part (Population Association of America, 1965).

In 1962-63 COPS considered evidence of
growing advocacy of the removal of race
and color designations from vital records
and census schedules. In view of the importance of statistics on race and color...
COPS drafted resolutions which were passed
by the Association .... Copies were transmitted to responsible officials... .

We cannot doubt, of course, that the
category “race” is extremely important.
Not only have extremists in our midst
pointed for years to the importance of
racial differences (although often they have
been voices crying in the wilderness), but
social scientists also assert such significance.
I, for example, confess that in several
years of teaching elementary population
courses I have been unable to finish one
without at least one lecture on racial
differences (although of course I do insert
the appropriate assertions that the differences are culturally induced). Further, all
of the sociological textbooks I use have
such chapters. One textbook (Nam, 1968)
explains:

... the problem of classifying individuals by

race and color is an exceedingly difficult one.

Racial classifications used in censuses are
designed to distinguish people on a cultural

rather than a biological basis. The United

States census categories, in fact, usually

represent some mixture of skin color (e.g.,

white), biological racial stock (e.g., Negro,

Indian), nationality (e.g., Korean, Chinese),

and religion (e.g. Hindu). However, many

demographic and social phenomena vary by

these “racial” categories and thus these cate
gories are analytically meaningful.
No student is likely to come away from
these courses without the proper appreciation of the significance of racial differences—a significance stressed throughout
our culture by institutions as varied as
the classroom, the census, and the theologies of both the Southern Baptist and the
Black Muslim.

Some misfit academicians have said no,
that this is all a mistake. Many anthropologists, biologists, sociologists, geneticists,
and the like have published assertions that
race makes little difference for social behavior, and some have gone so far as to
suggest that even the very concept of race
is all in our heads (Montagu, 1963,
1965; UNESCO, 1950, 1952; American
Anthropological Association, 1961).

These point out that although many biological characteristics are hereditary, only
a few are actually used for the concept of
race and for status assignment. We do not,
for example, make the redheads slaves
even though they are in the minority, nor
do we even consider them a separate race;
at least, not at this moment. We are told
(Ashmore, 1908) that in ancient Greek
comedy

Each character... was recognized at once
by the audience .... Black hair denoted the
young gentlemen, long and shaggy hair the
soldier, and red hair the slave.

The misfits who offer this point of view,
however, are in no more danger of upsetting the social order than the extremists,
because their voices are seldom heard
either,

Other academicians, including our great
founders, have taught us why the reasoning

Social Biology

of the misfits is fallacious; just because
an idea is not valid does not mean it cannot have consequences (Thomas and
Thomas, 1928; Merton, 1949).? And if
we wish to study the consequences, of
course we must be careful not to forget
the idea. No one in our society is likely to
forget for long, however, whether he is
white or black, because our census, which
is carefully aware of the social definition
of race, periodically reminds us of the
idea by asking each person to redefine for
himself which box he ought to fall into:
The concept of race, as it has been used
by the Bureau of the Census, is derived
from that which is commonly accepted by
the general public. It does not reflect clearcut definitions of biological stock, and several categories obviously refer to national
origin. The use of self-enumeration in the
1960 Census may have affected the data on
race... (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1964).
Few subjects in our society receive so
much scrutiny as race. Although we appear
to have a vast army of investigators studying race, several writers of widely disparate
persuasions have pointed out that we need
still more (Ingle, 1964; Arnold, 1970)?
Their observations attest to the usefulness
of having the data readily at hand in the
census volumes, which in turn recognize
the importance of the race data by giving
them enormous coverage. Race is one of
the five variables of our population measured by complete count, and it is crossclassified with possibly more categories
than any other variable.

2“Tf men define situations as real, they are real
in their consequences .. .” (Thomas and Thomas,
1928, p. 572).

3 “Why, then, examine the question of average
racial differences in genetic endowment? ... If it
is true that there are significant differences between the genetic endowments of the races, this
knowledge could and should affect the handling
of biological and sociological problems.” (Ingle,
1964, p. 376).

“. . social policy research . . . should become
an integral component of demography ... to
ameliorate the social problems of the kind overrepresented in the American black community ....” (Arnold, 1970, p. 311).

Vol. 18, No. 4

To the argument that race really makes
no difference for human behavior save in
the consequence of our conceptions, and
that its definition is so vague that it exists
as a category of status assignment only
because we make it so, there are several
answers. One is often voiced: race is selfevident. Blacks wear their category on
their faces, and it is real because it is
inherited just like red hair is real. And if
it is real it certainly may be used to
maintain status stability in a society, if
only the culture will continue to maintain
the reality of the race concept.

Certainly we are doing our part to keep
it that way. Even if, as critics hint, we
only study race so much because we are as
preoccupied with it as laymen are, our
vigorous pursuit of the subject can help
give it the reality it needs to stay alive.

Standing at the apex of our culture’s
thought, we have the power to expose to
all the world the legitimacy and the usefulness of the race concept. Although few
will listen to our words, more may be
impressed by our example. Students and
laymen can see that if the experts are
spending all this energy on race there
must be something to it,

PART 2: REMEDY

Seriously, the suggestion of this paper
is that we should stop asking the Bureau
of the Census for data classified by race,
and we should stop using the concept as
a variable in our work. Despite the equalitarian values most of us hold, our studies
—guided by a cultural obsession—may be
promoting racism instead of reducing it.

This paper assumes that equalitarian
goal. As Irene Taeuber (1970, p. 37) said:

The tests of future population policies,
planned and unplanned, will lie in the speed
and the completeness of the obliteration of
those demographies that can be categorized

by the colors of the skin or the subcultures
of origin.

Race and Demographie Analysis

 

389

Perhaps we can attain that goal more
speedily by helping to wipe out the concept of race which guides unequal social
policy.

Answering the question, ‘How can we
keep track of the growth and location of
races?” we must look again at the premise,
because the question implies that the category is somehow important. The premise
asks in reply, “Why would we want to?”
Ts it, then, equally important to know
where the whites are, and the blacks, where
the Indians went, and where are the redheads? The Bureau of the Census says it
is the social clustering that is important
for cultural diffusion and social action, and
not the biological inheritance. Yet it is
difficult to find such a concept of communicative grouping actually represented
by such categories as “Japanese-plusNegro-plus-Indian-plus-other-nonwhite,” or
even by such a category as “Negro.” One
sample of blacks, for example, found 82
members willing to identify as members
of an ethnic minority, but 44 members
who would not (Olsen, 1970).4 Other
studies have occasionally found blacks
and whites sharing characteristics with
each other and differing from others of
their own color, when matched by other
variables: (Goering and Coe, 1970; O. L.
Edwards, 1970; Glick 1970).5

4“ |. one means of testing the validity of the
ethnic community explanation of social and political participation among blacks is to separate black
respondents who identify as members of an ethnic
minority (N = 82) from those who do not (N=
44). (Twenty-eight blacks could not or would not
respond to this question . . .)” (Olsen, 1970, p.
692).

5“Negroes and whites in poverty respond to
medical alternatives in decision-making in an essentially similar manner” (Goering and Coe, 1970,
p. 313).
“The residential segregation of families by income and by stage of the family life cycle within
Milwaukee’s black community resembles in both
pattern and degree that in the white community”
(Q. L. Edwards, 1970, p. 185).

“Nonwhite women with graduate school training were exceptional in that they had an even

Other critics may suggest that if we did
not have the race data in the census we
would not be able to trace the progress
of social change or know where to aim
ameliorative programs. This argument
holds merit, as far as it goes, but it is
challenged on balance by other aspects:

First, we are not the sole users of the
data. In fact, there is no assurance that
the Bureau of the Census would stop using
race just because we quit asking, for we
would be quite in the minority if we asserted that it was not important. Newspapers, planners, and educators often use
racial breakdowns of data automatically,
because they assume it is important. Other
users may not have our altruistic intentions. As Thompson (1970, p. 313) put it:

. .. much of our demographic data is used
by policymakers to prevent things from being done by taking the data out “of context.

. Instead of leading to positive social policies, they might result in negative social
policy... . Some powerful people .. . claim

. blacks are incapable of being educated
in the same schools with white children.
They cite negative demographic data to support their contention.

In reference to segregation indices, Liebow
(1970, p. 90) wrote, “But I suspect that
some people, including the policy makers,
are using indices labeled in this way to
make value judgments on different cities,
and perhaps even for the implementation
of policies.”

When insurance companies or banks refuse service to whole areas because they
are “substandard” (meaning black) and
real estate promoters guide prospects away
from “wrong” areas, their “social action”
programs may have more telling effect
than ours. The advantage of the data for
ameliorative programs may not be worth
the harm they can do in a racist society,
either in directly maintaining racial sepa
ration or the importance of the concept.

higher per cent married than similarly educated
white women” (Glick, 1970, p. 101).

Second, the data may not be so valuable
to us as we so often take for granted.
Black, white, or Indian are not categories
of wealth; residential mixture does not
really indicate who is servant or master;
illegitimacy scores linked to race cannot
tell whose children are loved (Hillery,
1957; Gist and Fava, 1964; Teele and
Schmidt, 1970; Thompson, 1970).6 As
Himes (1970, p. 121) said, “the meaning
keeps leaking out.” Despite the comfort
provided by their precision, several indices of segregation that have depended
upon the distributions alone, without an
accompanying study of their meaning, have
been difficult to interpret (Van Arsdol
et al. on Shevky-Bell, 1958; Taeuber,
1965; Hauser, 1970; G. F. Edwards, 1970).
As Hauser (1970, p. 90) said of one index:

If you are discussing segregation in the
sense of human interaction and sharing of

the life space, obviously the index is not a
measure of that.

Taeuber, (1965, p. 4) wrote:

Like any single index used to represent a
complex phenomenon, the segregation index
is a summary device that does not reflect all
the subtleties of the actual situation. It does
not indicate the character of the residential
segregation in a city—that is, the strength
of white feelings. ...

To supply meaning, social scientists have
either had to make do with the short-cut
explanations provided by inference, or
supplement the census by asking questions,
using expensive techniques—membership
lists, canvasses, and the like—to bring
them face-to-face with their respondents
(Brookover and Holland, 1952; Lee, 1954;
Greenwood and Gormely, 1971).

6 “Jt always worries me when we start comparing the black family with the white middleclass family. . . . you almost never get a black
child adopted in the ghetto. They have an informal adoption and the child grows up with
three mothers—his aunt, his grandma and his
natural mother. If any one of them dies or leaves
he is in the same condition he was before; he has
the same security” (Thompson, 1970, p. 123).

Vol. 18, No. 4

Third, there are alternatives. These include the possibility of concentrating our
attention on more relevant variables, of
seeking other ways of finding “races”
when that information is really needed,
and of (and this is not a facetious suggestion) doing without.

Instead of spending all this energy on
race studies, we might be using more fruitful data. For example, we say race is not
a determinant but religion is, because men
follow their commitments to religious prescriptions for action; yet we continue to
gather data on race and not on religion.

Our studies have identified scores of
cultural, and ethnic—where
ethnicity is truly a group process—variables that we sorely need information
about. What are the locations of multigenerational households and family clusters? Where are the kinsmen? To what
groups and organizations do they belong?
Where are the people whose belief in the
afterlife is strong and who will be impelled
to spend their money on missions instead
of on their son’s education? Which people
will send their daughters to college? Many
such questions are linked to membership
in organizations, to physical condition, or
to the histories of individuals—data which
we do not presently gather in quantity.

When we use race distributions as a
model, often what we seek is an index to
the poor, to the lower class, to the repressed, to the isolated. We use blackness
as an index of these things, though we
know they are not caused by the blackness or limited to the blacks. As Donald
Bogue wrote (1959, p. 378-79):

Because parentage is one of the few traits
which a human being cannot change, except
by subterfuge, these cultural definitions tend
to prescribe class (and even caste) lines

which help to determine several other demographic, economic, and social characteristics.

If distributions of those attributes were

Race and Demographic Analysis

391

available directly, efficiency would be
gained and we would not meanwhile risk
misleading others into notions of racial
determinism. Therefore, this alternative
includes increasing the cross-classifications
of such fruitful variables as “income” and
“occupation” in place of the cross-classifications by race.

In those instances in which data on
racial distribution are really needed (I
am hard pressed here to conceive of such,
but must yield to the spirit of academic
inquiry), perhaps for rare-group blood
typing or for tracing migrations, there may
be other ways to get such information
without wholesaling its harmful consequences. If, as we assert, the categories
have no meaning except as the grouping
and counter-grouping of people give them
meaning, and to the extent that we are
referring to communicating groups and
not merely to categories, it should be possible for social scientists to find the members through group processes. Membership
lists, publishing lists, lead-me-to-a-neighbor interviewing techniques, and the like
have sometimes provided ingenious scholars with figures accurate enough for smallscale studies, albeit the process is expensive.

However, if the money now spent chasing “race” variables were diverted by the
census to gathering other information, the
advantages for our studies of having more
valid variables at hand, so that we no
longer had to infer them indirectly or
gather them ourselves, might more than
offset the loss. Thus, we might be ahead
in total research cost. Too often we use
existing census classifications just because
they are there, the nearest approximations
to what we really want, when we would
rather have something closer to our real
variables.

Another alternative is to do without—
not in a spartan sense, but because frequently there is a better way. For examDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:32 08 December 2015

ple, the List of Figures shown in Table 1
was taken from a study of mental health
facilities and population which was prepared for the Arkansas Board of Health
(Bogue and Walker, 1964).

Although black-white differentials are
found in Arkansas in nearly every aspect
of life, this report analyzed thirty tables
of census data for mental-health planning
purposes without putting in a table on
race except as an afterthought at the very
end. (That final tabulation was really unnecessary, but the publishers, guided by
tradition, thought the data incomplete
without it.) The same report could have
been entirely different; it could have had
the traditional racial breakdowns of data
for every table, but such would have been

unwarranted because the mental health
variables under consideration were poverty,
transiency, health, role consistency, status
change, and the like, to which race is
wholly incidental even though its association at every step invites false inference.

The very availability of all our mass
of race-classified data, however, invites a
short-circuiting of our thinking so that
we are likely to ignore the teachings of
our science and work with irrelevant variables.

Therein may lie the greatest danger to
us, aS social scientists, of the census race
data—not that we might be misled into
becoming racists, as laymen might be, but
that we will be misled into unprofitable
research and loss of theoretical perspective.
