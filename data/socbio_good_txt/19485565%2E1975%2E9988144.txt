Effectiveness of Abortion as Birth Control

Throughout the world, legal abortion
services have increasingly been included
as a component of health care. The United
States has now joined the growing number
of nations that have for various reasons
determined that abortion services should
be legally available. In some countries,
the legalization of abortion services has
been a direct response of policymakers to
the need for controlling the rate of growth
of the population, while in other nations
legalization has resulted from a recognition of individual rights.

The legalization of abortion services has
profound social implications, among the
most important of which involve the demographic effects of abortion. Evaluating the
demographic effects of abortion is not a
simple task. Many basic issues, such as the
effects of available abortion services on
contraceptive use, remain unanswered. But
some indication of the demographic consequences of abortion can be studied. One
approach to examining the demographic
effects of abortion has been to analyze fertility data from countries in which legal
abortion services have been made either

California, Davis, California.

 

more or less available in order to evaluate
the demographic effects of these changes.

Frederiksen and Brackett (1968) established four classes of prototype situations
for the provision of legalized abortion services to examine the relative demographic
effects of abortion. Their classification was
as follows: (1) large-scale abortion introduced where there is a widespread use of
contraception; (2) large-scale abortion
introduced where there is a widespread
use of illegal abortion; (3) large-scale
abortion introduced where contraception is
not widely practiced; and (4) large-scale
contraception introduced where both legal
and illegal abortion are widely practiced.

From the worldwide experience with legal abortion services, Frederiksen and
Brackett examined each category in the
classification to evaluate the demographic
effects of abortion under the four possible
situations. From this analysis, they concluded: (1) An increase in the number of
legal abortions was followed by an increase
in illegal abortions. (2) Where contraception is widely practiced, the availability of
legal abortion services may result in a decrease in the effectiveness with which
individuals practice contraception rather
than a reduction in the birth rate below the
level obtained through the use of contra

ception. (3) When contraception is introduced where abortion is widely practiced,
the resulting decline in the abortion rate
may parallel a decline in fertility rates.

In their discussion, Frederiksen and
Brackett (1968) raise many important
issues. They ask whether abortion and
contraception would be more effective and
efficient in combination as a substitute for
the use of contraception without abortion;
and they imply that other situations, such
as the introduction of abortion where contraception is not widely practiced, deserve
further investigation as to their demographic significance.

Attempting to observe fertility rates
that are the result of complex social, economic, and psychological interactions in
such a manner as to differentiate the effects
of abortion is a difficult task. Fortunately,
mathematical demographers have developed models which can be used to study
the effectiveness of abortion in population
limitation where effectiveness is measured
by the number of abortions that are required to substitute for one live birth. At
the same time, it must be recognized that
these models omit important interactions
so that the assumptions required in applying them must be clearly recognized in the
analysis of the results. This article will
examine some of these models, extend one
of them, and discuss the public health implications of the results.

MODELS FOR ABORTION EFFECTIVENESS
MEASUREMENT

Potter (1963) examined the components of the birth interval to evaluate how
abortion would affect this interval, since
the longer the interval, the lower the fertility rates, assuming that all other factors
are constant. By this mechanism, the effect
of abortion on birth intervals could provide a measure of the demographic effects

Social Biology

of abortion on a population’s fertility
rates.

Assuming the absence of contraception
and that most induced abortions are performed in the second or third month of
pregnancy, Potter found that 100 induced
abortions account for 900 months of marriage. Without lactation, approximately 43
live births could have occurred during this
length of time. Stated differently, it would
require 100 abortions to substitute for 43
live births, or over two abortions for each
live birth.

Extending the analysis to the situation
where prolonged lactation is allowed after
a live birth, the effectiveness of abortion is
decreased even further. Since lactation
prolongs the birth interval, only 30 live
births would occur during the same period
of time in which 100 induced abortions
occur. In this instance, more than three
abortions are required to substitute for
one live birth.

When contraception is used and abortion is employed as a backup to contraceptive failure, the result is more favorable.
With 90 per cent effective contraception,
the mean length of time to conception during ovulatory cycles would increase from
five months to fifty months. In this instance, 100 induced abortions would substitute for 82 live births by the same logic
applied in the previous examples. With
prolonged lactation, 100 induced abortions
would substitute for 72 live births. Potter
concluded that induced abortion is much
more effective when accompanied by contraception, a finding that is now generally
accepted.

Models of the effects of contraception,
abortion, and sterilization on birth rates
have been developed by many other investigators. The origins of such investigations
can be traced to Pearl (1939) who began
to think in terms of the number of pregnancies occurring over a specified interval
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

Vol. 22, No. 1

of time during which a woman was exposed to the possibility of pregnancy.
From this basic concept relating exposure
time and outcome, numerous extensions
and refinements were possible, leading to
more sophisticated models in recent years.

Sheps and Perrin (1963) developed a
stochastic model of human reproduction by
applying the theory of Markov renewal
processes which included the three biological phenomena basic to the evaluation of
the effectiveness of abortion for birth control: (1) fecundability, the monthly probability of conception for a woman exposed
to the possibility of pregnancy; (2) the
probability of a conception culminating in
a live birth; and (3) the period of varying
duration after a pregnancy when a woman
is not capable of pregnancy as a result of
postpartum suppression of ovulation. Varying the parameters yielded many different
results, but the overall conclusion of the
authors was that the use of more effective
methods of contraception by smaller fractions of the population would depress birth
rates more than the use of less effective
methods of contraception by a greater
fraction of the population.

Anyone who has developed models is
aware that there are many problems inherent in abstracting from reality to a
form expressable in mathematical terms.
The result of these limitations is frequently
the development of more complex models
in an attempt to capture a greater degree
of realism. Mathematical demography has
been no exception to this quest for greater
sophistication. For example, Perrin and
Sheps (1964) extended their previous
models of human reproduction, and Potter
(1970) has applied renewal theory to determine births averted by contraception.

While models of human reproduction
continue to expand in complexity, many
of the basic relationships remain expressable with relatively simple mathematics.

Abortion as Birth Control

25

Keyfitz (1971) has applied renewal theory
to answer some demographic questions
related to induced abortion. Keyfitz’s
model will be extended here to examine
some public health implications of legal
abortions.

THE KEYFITZ MODEL

The probability that a fertile woman
will conceive in one month is defined as 4,
so that in the first month women will be
expected to conceive. In the second month,
the monthly probability of conception is
again ». At the end of the second month,
P(1—p) of the original group of women
will have become pregnant, and so forth
for succeeding months. Summing the
products of the fraction who become pregnant in each month and the number of
months to conception produces an infinite
series whose sum is 1/p. If the monthly
probability of conception, homogeneous
over all women in the population, is #,
then the mean number of months to pregnancy for all women in the population
is 1/p.

But the mean number of months to
conception must be added onto the period
of time during which a woman is sterile
following conception. If the length of this
sterile period is defined as s,, then the
total time that a woman is pregnant or
sterile is 1/p +- 51, assuming that there is
no pregnancy wastage and that the sterile
period is homogeneous over all women.

An abortion changes the period of sterility after conception, which was defined
as $,; for pregnancies that continued to
term. The mean time to conception will
remain the same, 1/. If the sterile period,
composed of the time the woman is pregnant before the abortion and the time after
the abortion during which she is anovulatory, is defined as Seg, then the mean
Jength of time that a woman who obtains

 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

26 Williams and Pullum

an abortion is pregnant or sterile is 1/p +So.

The relative effectiveness of abortion as
compared to pregnancy carried to term is
determined by dividing the length of the
sterile period from abortion into that from
pregnancy carried to term,

1/p+s1
1/p + Se’

to yield the relative number of abortion
cycles that fit into a single birth cycle.
Using the parameter values given by Keyfitz, p—= 0.20, 55 == 17, sg=3, this expression equals 22/8. In other words,
nearly three abortions are required to substitute for each live birth, in the absence
of contraception and with the assumption
of homogeneity.

The use of contraception will modify
the monthly probability of conception, #.
Contraception increases the length of time
required to conception since a woman will
not become pregnant until the contraception fails and conception occurs, or until
she stops the use of the contraception and
conception occurs.

A new parameter, e, the monthly effciency of contraception can be used to
modify ~. This yields a new monthly probability of conception, p(1—e) as the
result of multiplying the monthly probability of conception in the absence of
contraception by the monthly probability
of a contraceptive failure. Substituting in
equation (1) yields

1/p(i—e) +51
1/p(1 —e) + 52

Using the same values for the parameter
as in the previous example, and assuming
that a contraceptive of 95 per cent efficiency is used by all women, results in a
solution to equation (2) of 1.14, In other
words, 1:14 abortions are required to pre

vent one birth when a 95 per cent effective
contraceptive is used.

A NEW MODEL FOR ABORTION
EFFECTIVENESS MEASUREMENT

A similar model can be developed somewhat differently by first relating the
probability of conception and the sterile
intervals to the number of births and the
number of women in the population.

A measure of the monthly birth rate
can be derived from 1/p by defining NV
as the total number of women in the population, and £, as the annual number of
births that occur in the absence of any
pregnancy wastage. Then, in any month,
if there were no sterile interval associated
with pregnancy, the following would hold:

N 1

Including the period of postconception
sterility yields

N __ 1/p +84
E, — 12 ? (4)
or, with some algebra,
12N
i=————. 5
Tp +s ()

But abortion must be included in the
formulation. If abortions, E2, were the
only possible pregnancy outcome, then
following the above logic,

__ 12N
1/p + 52°

If all conceptions end in either an abortion or a live birth, then the number of
available months of exposure among
women in the population, 12, must equal
the number allocated to the two outcomes:

12N = E,(1/p + 51) + E2(1/p + 52).
(7)

Thus, total months available is equal to

E2 (6)

Vol. 22, No. I

the sum of months attributable to abortions and live births according to equations
(3) and (6).

Equation (7) can now be used to determine the effectiveness of abortion as
birth control. If equation (7) is differentiated,

It is an expression for the effectiveness of
abortion and is equivalent to equation (2).

The use of contraception can be included following logic similar to the derivation of equation (2), so that

dE, 1+ p(1 —e)(s2)

If the efficiency of contraception is 0.95,
the effectiveness of abortion is 1.14. Thus,
following a different formulation, the efficiency of abortion has been derived for
a population of N women on an annual
basis. Since, in this formulation, NV is not
a function of the number of abortions nor
of the number of births, the result is identical to the derivation of Keyfitz. However, this formulation is more appropriate
when discussing a population of women,
rather than a single woman, and equations
(7) and (11) are useful for further applications.

RESULTS

The effectiveness of abortion is a function of the time in gestation when the
abortion is performed. To examine how
the effectiveness of abortion relates to

Abortion as Birth Control

27

gestation and to determine the mediating
effects of contraception, computations were
performed using equation (11) under
various assumptions.

To simplify the analysis, we assumed
that ovulation occurs one month after
induced abortion; there is only limited
data available on the relation between
induced abortion and ovulation (Boyd
and Holmstrom, 1972), but the return of
ovulation appears to be rapid. For this
analysis, it was also assumed that lactation is artificially suspended after delivery
so that the period of postpartum sterility
is two months (Perez et al., 1971). This
is an approximate estimate and many variations in the application of data to these
analyses are possible; some of these will
be discussed below. Finally, » is again
assumed to be 0.2, and pregnancy wastage
except from induced abortion is omitted.

The results of the analysis (Table 1)
indicate that, as demonstrated previously,
the use of efficient contraception has a
significant effect on the effectiveness of
abortion. With abortion performed at
three months gestation, 1.78 abortions are
required to substitute for each live birth,
in the absence of the use of contraception.
But when a contraceptive of 95 per cent
efficiency is used, only 1.07 abortions are
required to substitute for each live birth.

The effectiveness of abortion is much
more sensitive to the gestation of pregnancy when the abortion is performed
when a contraceptive of lower efficiency
is used. Comparing the performance of an
abortion at one month gestation and three

1 This assumption is acceptable in this application since it simplifies the analysis without substantially distorting the results. A considerably
more complex formulation which includes all
pregnancy outcomes largely confirms the findings
reported here (Williams, 1974). Furthermore, as
discussed at the end of this paper, all conceptions
are equally exposed to the risk of spontaneous
pregnancy loss so that it is only a small fraction
of all conceptions that might influence these results.

months gestation, the difference in effectiveness is 2.29 minus 1.78 or 0.51 when
no contraception is used. This is a reduction of over 22 per cent. When a contraceptive of 95 per cent effectiveness is used,
the reduction is 1.09 minus 1.07 or 0.02,
a reduction of only slightly over 1.8 per
cent.

These findings have important policy
implications. From a demographic point
of view, abortion later in pregnancy reaps
considerable benefits over early abortion
when contraception is not used. On the
other hand, with the use of even moderately efficient contraception, this advantage largely disappears. From a practical
perspective, this finding should even fur
ther emphasize the importance of contraception, even if it is only moderately
effective.

Similar calculations were performed to
investigate the effects of modifying the
previous assumptions to allow for prolonged lactation. While the length of lactation would not be homogeneous over all
women, for purposes of simplicity we will
assume that it is. Furthermore, we will
assume the length of lactation to be such
that suppression of ovulation lasts for eight
months (Perez et al., 1971).

The results (Table 2) indicate that the
sensitivity of the effectiveness of abortion
to gestation is approximately the same
when lactation is included as when it is

not, although abortion is more effective
at all gestations and for all contraceptive
efficiency levels in the absence of lactation. However, the importance of lactation
is far less for populations that practice
even moderately effective contraception.
From a policy perspective, encouraging
lactation in a population that is using
moderately or highly effective contraception will not substantially increase the
effectiveness with which abortion is utilized by that population.

The value of ~, the monthly probability
of conception, used in the computations
assumes a healthy population with frequent exposure to intercourse. However,
many women obtaining abortions are not
engaged in frequent coital activity. Similarly, the use of contraception varies considerably.

To examine the effects of changes in
the parameters ~ and e on the effectiveness of abortion, we assumed that abortions are performed, on the average, at
three months gestation (Center for Disease Control, 1972). Without lactation,
the effectiveness of induced abortion (Table 3) is sensitive to p only for substantive
differences in that parameter when e is

Abortion as Birth Control 29

constant. For example, when e is zero, increasing ~ from 0.10 to 0.20 only increases
the effectiveness of abortion by 0.28 or 19
per cent. This increase in p is a large one,
representing a doubling in the time to conception. The sensitivity of the effectiveness
of abortion to decreases as e€ increases.
A similar pattern is apparent when lactation is introduced (Table 4). However,
with the substantially increased postpartum sterile period, the effectiveness of
abortion becomes more sensitive to changes
in p with e constant. For example, with e
equal to zero, the effectiveness of abortion
increases 26 per cent when # is increased
from 0.10 to 0.20 as compared to only
19 per cent without lactation. Further, as
would be expected, the absolute levels for
the effectiveness of abortion are higher
with lactation for all values of p and e.
From a policy perspective, these findings indicate that the effectiveness of abortion at any level of contraceptive efficiency
is more sensitive to the fecundity of the
women in the population when those
women lactate, where fecundity is the
monthly probability of conception. Lactation for a longer time than is represented
in the computations for Table 4 will ac

centuate this effect while lactation for a
shorter period of time will moderate it.
Sheps and Perrin (1963) concluded that
the use of more effective contraception by
smaller fractions of the population would
depress birth rates more than the use of
less effective methods by more women.
Table 3 confirms this conclusion, especially
if the more effective contraception is used
by the more fecund women. The number
of abortions required to avert one birth
are used as an indication of the relative
birth rates. Comparing more _ fecund
women (/ more than 0.20) with less fecund women (? less than 0.20), the percentage reduction in the effectiveness of
abortion is lower for women with lower
fecundity as contraceptive efficiency increases. For example, for # equal to 0.14,
the effectiveness of abortion decreases
from 1.63 to 1.01, or 38 per cent as e
increases from zero to 0.99, For p equal
to 0.24, the reduction is from 1.86 to 1.02,
or 45 per cent over the same range of e.
Since Table 3 presents values for a
wide range in the parameters, it is useful
to limit the ranges for p and e to those of
the United States population at the current time. Unfortunately, the values of

p and e for a large population are not easily determined. However, some ranges can
be estimated. Since the effectiveness of
abortion is not highly sensitive to moderate changes in # and, to a lesser extent,
in é, these estimates may be fairly reliable.

The value of e in the U.S. married population can be estimated from the National
Fertility Study (Westoff, 1972). Using a
weighted average of the use of contraception by method and estimates of the efficiency of each method, we derive a value
of about 84 per cent (Table 5) when
nonusers are also included with an efficiency of ~. This calculation does not
include single women. Since many single
women obtaining abortions used no contraception (Kantner and Zelnik, 1973),
it is unlikely that the overall value for e
for all women in the reproductive ages is
greater than about 90 per cent. Somewhat
arbitrarily, we might estimate a range between 70 and 90 per cent for women ages
15-44.

The value of is even more difficult to
determine. Some highly fecund women
might conceive in less than two months
while many other women may require ten
or twelve months to conceive. Many fac

tors affect this variable in large heterogeneous populations. Jain (1969) found
values of # considerably below 0.2 in Taiwan. For all U.S. females, the value of p
may very likely fall below 0.2 and may
even be below 0.1. For the present calculations, a range of possible values for p
between 0.06 and 0.16 is assumed.

Using these ranges for p and e, the effectiveness of abortion as applied to U.S.
females ages 15-44 is presented in Table
6. The range of values for the effectiveness
of abortion is from slightly more than 1
to about 1.3. These values indicate that,

on the average, abortion is actually a
fairly effective method of fertility limitation in this population.

These computations are based on an
aggregate of all women in the reproductive ages. Table 3 indicates that for more
fecund women and for women using less
efficient contraception, abortion is less effective.

The provision of abortion services is
dependent on the number of women who
will seek such services. The computations
with the model presented here indicate
that expenditures on abortion services are
a reasonable investment when viewed in
terms of the alternative cost, the purchase
of obstetrical services. Clearly, investment
in contraception is also to be recommended,
although for the entire U.S. female population an increase in contraceptive efficiency to 0.90 or higher for e would be
required to produce any sizeable increase
in the effectiveness of abortion.

. For young highly fecund women using
no contraception, abortion is not a very
effective birth control method. The effect
of abortion averaged over the entire population at risk of pregnancy is different from
its effect on certain subgroups within that
population. For example, women of different ages have different levels of fecundity. However, Potter (1972) has conDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

cluded that the number of births averted
is rather insensitive to age. The factors
that are probably more important are the
frequency of coital activity and the use of
contraception.

Further refinements in the model are
possible. Equation (11) could be applied
individually to various segments of the
population at risk, and then the results
could be summed to yield more accurate
population estimates. However, the same
results have essentially been presented by
modifying the values of p and e.

Pregnancy wastage, not included in
equation (11), could be incorporated into
the model. Aside from induced abortion,
pregnancy wastage results from spontaneous abortions and stillborn infants. The
latter occurs in only a small fraction of
deliveries and for purposes of examining
the effectiveness of abortion can be excluded from the model.

The crucial factor in determining how
spontaneous abortion will affect the results
presented thus far is the fraction of spontaneous abortions that occur before the
gestation selected as the average time in
pregnancy when the induced abortion is

performed. Induced abortions in Tables
3, 4, and 6 were assumed to occur at three
months gestation.

Among women studied by Shapiro et al.
(1971), the fetal death rate was 152 per
1,000 pregnancies, excluding deaths reported at less than four weeks gestation.
Including allowance for undetected deaths,
their most likely estimate of the death
rate is 218 per 1,000. However, by twelve
weeks gestation of pregnancy, nearly all
fetal deaths in their study were being reported. For pregnancies of twelve to nineteen weeks gestation, the rate is 54/1,000
and for 20 weeks or more, 22/1,000. Thus,
spontaneous abortion beyond the crucial
threshold of the average time in pregnancy
when induced abortion is performed is less
than 50 per cent. When induced abortions
are performed very early in pregnancy
spontaneous abortion is an especially important factor.
