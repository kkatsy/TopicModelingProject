Preselecting the Sex of Offspring:
Technologies, Attitudes, and Implications

ABSTRACT: Several techniques for preselecting the sex of offspring are available now or will be in the
near future. Although hundreds of studies indicate that sons are desired by the overwhelming proportion of persons asked, few studies ask whether preselecting of sex of offspring ought to be made
available generally, as the technologies become perfected. In northern California, 2,138 respondents indicated widespread acceptance of ongoing biomedical research to perfect preselection
methods and of making these procedures available to potential parents. Almost half agreed that
they might want to use such techniques. Variation in levels of agreement were assessed by sex, race,
marital status, child-parity, religious affiliation and attendance, level of education, class, and
general attitudes toward medical and scientific leaders. The implications of the general acceptability of sex selection go far beyond the freedom of parental choice—to such matters as socialization
patterns of first son, second daughter ordering, sex role inflexibilities, sex ratio imbalances, and also

include possibilities for curtailing rapid population growth.

The ideas people hold about the desirability of sons or daughters and ideas
about the appropriateness of preselecting
the sex of children vary from one culture
to another. While there has been a great
deal of information collected on sex preference, there is little available data on attitudes toward actual sex preselection.
Perhaps the possibility of choosing the
sex of offspring has not been taken seriously, but current biomedical research
procedures are about to supply several
easy, cheap, and relatively accurate techniques.

There is a widespread belief across all
political systems that facilitating human
choice, when it does not interfere with the
rights of the state or other persons, is a
positive goal. Thus, if couples desire a son
as a first child, why not help them achieve

their goal? Or, if parents would be willing
to limit the numbers of children they produce by obtaining sex-parity goals, the
limits to population growth could be of
benefit to entire societies and the biosphere as well. Many parents have been
sadly disappointed in trying again and
again in childbirth to achieve the desired
sex. Now, the implied numerical goals of
the family planning motto “every child a
wanted child’”’ may be expanded to include
the wanted sex of offspring.

In this paper we examine the current
and potential techniques of sex preselection, previous research on sex preferences, attitudes toward choosing the sex
of offspring, including details of our own
survey results, and finally, we examine
some of the implications of the potential
use of the technologies being perfected.

THE TECHNOLOGY OF SEX
PREDETERMINATION

Sex preselection techniques have been

‘ developed over time from research that

originated with other goals: e.g., research
into techniques for helping infertile or
subfertile couples conceive and research
into the prenatal health of the fetus. The
state of the art is so advanced that some of
the more available techniques of sex preselection are already being used by couples in many nations of the world. Other
techniques are still in the experimental
stage, but offer greater promise for successfully determining the progeny’s sex,
most typically before conception. The
newer methods promise to be ‘“‘easy,
cheap, and virtually free from error”’
(Ericsson, 1976).

As far back as the 1920’s in Germany,
Unterberger (1932) reportedly experimented with altering the acid-alkali balance of the vagina in order to influence the
female-male conception ratio. Repeated
tests did not affirm the efficacy of the
method, but years later, used in conjunction with a whole set of procedures during
coitus, high proportions of successful sex
selection were reported. It was in the late
1960’s that Landrum Shettles (Rorvik and
Shettles, 1970) detailed the system that he
claims to be as high as 80 to 90 per cent
effective. The technique is elucidated in
detail in a book that has been translated
into over thirteen languages (Rorvik and
Shettles, 1971) and practiced by unknown
numbers of couples around the world. The
procedures for predeterming the sex of
offspring involve precise timing with reference to ovulation and frequency of sexual
intercourse, douching with a prescribed
acidic or alkaline solution prior to intercourse, and specific positioning during the
act of intercourse. An advantage lies in
the fact that the technique may be utilized
by couples in the privacy of the home, but

it is estimated to have lower actual probabilities of success than are expected with
new methods.’

Roberts of Guy’s Medical School in
London (1972) discovered that the Xbearing sperm was richer in DNA and
therefore fatter than the Y-type sperm.
This caused the X-chromosome-bearing
sperm to swim slower than the Ychromosome-bearing sperm. That knowledge sparked research in sperm separation in test tubes. Ericsson, Langevin, and
Nishino at the Schering Laboratory in
Berlin used a dense fluid that separated
out the less active sperm, which are predominantly the female-producing Xbearing type, allowing the more active Ybearing sperm to swim through and collect
at the bottom of the fluid, increasing the
concentration from about 50 to as much as
85 per cent (Ericsson et al., 1973, p. 424).
The technique is used to select Y-bearing
sperm only. Since some defective sperm
with disordered chromosomes will be concentrated with the X-bearing type, daughter choice by the method is currently inadvisable. Ericsson, continuing his research
in California, is using sperm separation
with artificial insemination on human patients. Dr. W. Paul Dmouski of the Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago uses the
same method. These two researchers report the method has produced eleven
male and three female children.

Meanwhile, at the Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center, Bennett and
Boyse (1973) destroyed a large number of
male sperm in mice with an antiserum
chemical which seeks out and destroys Ybearing sperm. They found that 8 per cent
more female mice were born with treated
than with untreated sperm.

In the time between the 1971 and 1977 editions
of their book, Rorvik and Shettles claim to have received almost three thousand letters from couples
who used their method in which fewer than a dozen
reported failure.

Another research technique involves
subjecting thinned semen to electrophoresis. The hypothesis is that sperm bearing X
chromosomes will be drawn to the positive
electrode, while Y chromosomes will be
drawn to the.negative electrode. Artificial
insemination could then be used with semen of the chosen sex-chromosomal concentration. Experimental work with rabbits and cattle has produced inconsistent
results.

The Chinese have conducted research

on sex preselection with amniocentesis, a

medical procedure widely used to determine the health of, and possible defects in,
the unborn fetus. At the Teitung Hospital
of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company,
amniocentesis is being used to predict the
sex of the fetus as early as the 47th day after conception. Cells of fetal origin are obtained from the reproductive tract of the
mother during the first trimester and analyzed for Barr body (cell structures found
normally only in females). Abortion prior
to the twelfth week is possible. This is the
only technique being studied or utilized
that would allow an early post-conception
decision on aborting a fetus of unwanted
sex. Early research indicated accurate sex
prediction in 93 out of 100 cases. Thirty of
these sets of parents chose abortion, and
in 29 of those cases the predicted sex was
female (Campbell, 1976).

Meanwhile, Shettles has also been experimenting with filters of varying
configurations that will allow the slightly
smaller male-producing sperm to pass
through (Shettles, 1978). This technique is
not as easy as it may sound, since the main
body of the sperm is only 1/8,000 of an
inch across.

Of the many techniques being studied,
selective abortion and sperm separation in
combination with artificial insemination
seem to be the two methods most likely to
be available and utilized in the near future. It is impossible to know at this early

Social Biology

date the probable extent of use of these
techniques as they are perfected. It is possible, however, to tap current attitudes toward the increasing availability of techniques and to determine the importance
given to ongoing biomedical attempts to
perfect the technologies.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH
ATTITUDES TOWARD SEX SELECTION

In spite of the vast literature on the salience of sex of offspring to individuals,
couples, and extended families, and the
hundred of research reports detailing son
preference (see Williamson, 1976), there
has been little attitudinal research on sex
predetermination.

In 1968 Markle and Nam sampled students at three colleges in Florida, asking if
they would like to choose the sex of their
future children. Of the 283 persons or 64
per cent responding, 26 per cent were favorable to the idea, 41 per cent were not
favorable, and the remainder were not
sure or had no preference. While 37 per
cent of blacks were favorable, only 22 per
cent of whites were so disposed. Malefemale differences were slight, with
slightly higher proportions of males favorable. Fewer single (23 per cent) than married respondents (36 per cent) were favorable to sex preselection. Variations in
reported responses were greatest for those
with different religious orientations.
While only 9 per cent of Catholics were favorable, 27 per cent of Protestants and 38
per cent of those with no religious affiliation were favorable to the use of these procedures. As will be evident below, the
1968 Florida results were very different
from those of our respondents in northern
California in 1977.

Data collected in the 1970 National
Fertility Study have been examined by
Westoff and Rindfuss (1974) for indicaDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

tions of sex preference and for feelings
about the ability to choose the sex of
children. 5,805 currently married women
indicated sex preferences that were similar to the actual sex ratios for all births.
Yet, if implemented, their preferences
would imply an increase in first-born
males and second-born females. The
short-term sex ratio differentials could be
great, but implications for socialization
within the family and sex-role stereotyping are far more profound. The NFS questionnaire also asked: “‘Sometime soon,
couples will be able to choose in advance
whether they will have a boy or girl. How
would you feel about being able to choose
the sex of a child?” Overall, 38.8 per cent
were for, 46.7 per cent against, and 14.6
per cent were neutral about being able to
make such achoice. Differences according
to sex composition of past births were relatively small, with only 32.7 per cent of
those with equal number of girls and boys
and 42.7 per cent of those with all girls favoring the possibility.

The unpublished doctoral dissertation
of Gale Largey (1972) adds a great deal to
an understanding of attitudes toward sex
predetermination, but the sample includes only 127 couples. Among these respondents, religion (non-Catholic), age,
innovativeness, and strengh of sex preference were related to acceptance of sex
control.

PREFERENCE FOR SEX OFFSPRING

In contrast to the paucity of research
data reported above, there are countless
studies in the United States and many
other countries of the world asking
whether people prefer sons or daughters,
whether they would have preferred a son
if they already had a daughter and vice
versa, whether if they were to have only
one child, or two, three, etc., what the sex
preference for each one would be. Other
researchers have asked whether respon
Preselecting the Sex of Offspring

235

dents would advise friends to have a boy
or girl, etc. These studies have been
brought together, organized, and summarized by Williamson (1976).

In the United States, studies dating
back more than 40 years include those reported by Winston (1932), Clare and Kiser (1951), Strunk (1947), Dinitz (1954),
Peterson and Peterson (1973), Markle
(1969), and Fawcett (1975). Over time
there has been a consistent preference for
a male child as the only child and/or first
child. Nevertheless, most couples in the
United States prefer a balanced family,
currently one boy and one girl, although
whenever the desire for an uneven number is reported, the desire for males predominates. Although Winston’s study in
the early 1930’s produced an ideal sex ratio of 165, the more recent research reports indicate a range of preferred sex ratios of 106 to 122. Since the natural sex
ratio at birth, defined as the ratio of males
to females (multiplied by 100), js typically
103 to 105, the lower end of the reported
preference ratio is about the same. These
are certainly modest sex ratios when compared with the cross-national reports. Nevertheless, the range reported within
the United States, together with the order
preference (son, then daughter), if implemented, could produce a variety of
significant social-structural and psychological changes in society.

Among those studies within European
nations there is great variety on the issue
of preference for sons or daughters. Research in Sweden by Dahlberg (1949) and
more recently by Uddenberg et al. (1971)
indicates little evidence of son preference.
In other countries of Europe where males
enjoy a higher status in society, e.g., Italy,
Switzerland, and Belgium (Gini, 1966)
and Hungary (Coombs et al., 1975) re-search reports indicate greater son preference.

Within the less developed countries of

236 Hartley and Pietraczyk

the world, holding the largest proportion
of the population of the world, son preference predominates overwhelmingly.
These are societies which are patrilineal,
patriarchal, and patrilocal in nature. The
elderly rely on their sons for support in
their old age. Religious and cultural beliefs also influence the desire for many
sons. Contributing to the number and sex
preference patterns is the fact that families
are not sure of the survival of children.
Son preference is also found to be closely
related to the sex roles prevalent in the society, the level of urbanization, and the
overall and individual level of education.
The higher the level of education and the
more egalitarian sex-role ideology, the
more balanced the expressed sex preference for offspring (Markle, 1974, p. 140).
With the mass of cross-national studies
indicating son preference, it is not too soon
to begin examining the attitudes people hold about the perfection of the techniques of sex selection and the possible
use of these techniques by potential
parents. Although we cannot know to
what extent current attitudes will
influence future behaviors, it is only by ongoing research regarding these issues and
their implications for the future that individual and public decision-making will
achieve “informed consent” and avoid
drifting into unintended consequences.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

As one step in sparking public interest
in and measuring attitudes about reproductive engineering in general and sex
preselection in particular, a 52-item questionnaire was developed and pretested
among students in two sections of ‘‘Social
Research Methods” at California State
University, Hayward, in the spring of
1976. The survey instrument was revised
slightly, and an interview pretest was conducted. The questionnaire with 60 items

 

Social Biology

was then used to tap attitudes of adults of
all ages and work situations. The results of
this third pretest (1976) with 540 respondents were reported at professional meetings the following June.”

In the spring of 1977, research students
were organized to sample, by means of a
table of random numbers, students from
classes scheduled on five different college
campuses in the northern California area.
On each campus, biology classes were
sampled from the physical sciences, sociology classes from the social sciences,
business and accounting classes from the
applied and technical fields, and music
and art classes were sampled from humanities. Both lower and upper division
classes were selected where appropriate.
Cooperation in responding was close to
100 per cent within each class. The campuses included Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley, as Ph.D.
granting institutions; California State
University, Hayward, as a campus
offering bachelor’s and master’s degrees;
and Laney and Chabot as two-year community colleges.

The usable response sets numbered
2,138, comprised of 53.1 per cent males
and 46.9 per cent females. The sex distribution was within 1 per cent of that for
enrollees in higher education in California
in the fall of 1975 (most recent date). Of
the respondents, 11.6 per cent identified
themselves as black; 3.8 per cent, Latino;
10.2 per cent, Oriental; 0.9 per cent,
American Indian (subsequently combined
with the 5.3 per cent ‘“‘Other’’); and 68.3
per cent, white. These figures may be
compared with the San Francisco Oakland

Reports from the pilot survey on attitudes toward five different aspects of reproductive engineering (including embryo transfers, sperm banks,
and cloning) were presented at a session of the
American Association for the Advancement of
Science, Pacific Division, Section K, on June 13,
1977 in San Francisco.

racial distribution from the 1970 census.
While black and white respondents were
equal to proportions, we have twice the
percentage of Orientals and only onethird the percentage of SpanishAmericans as were recorded by the census. In terms of religious background,
Catholics were overrepresented in the
sample (29.4 per cent) as compared to the
larger population. Of the sample, 18.1 per
cent indicated that they were Protestant
Fundamentalists; 20.7 per cent, Protestant non-Fundamentalists; 5.3 per cent,
Jewish; 7 per cent, other; and 19.6 per
cent, no religious background or atheists.

While the sample cannot be considered
representative of even the college population in general, much less all adults in the
United States, it does have the advantage
of being heavily weighted with persons in
the early-to-middle stages of reproductive
decision-making. College students are often thought to be opinion leaders, and
thus even these off-the-top-of-the-head
attitudes should be of interest in them
 

selves, and as bench marks for future
measurement.

Three distinctly different questions
were asked regarding the predetermination of the sex of offspring. The intent was
to get at three different aspects of the issue.

At the very beginning of the questionnaire a series of statements were offered to
tap levels of agreement vs. disagreement.
The introductory statement indicated:
“Genetic counseling is now available in
some communities as a part of birth planning. Please let us know how you feel now
about the following: 1. If it becomes possible to predetermine the sex of offspring,
such a possibility should be available to ail
parents. 2. Would you want to use sucha
procedure?” Six possible responses from
strongly agree to strongly disagree were
provided. A whole series of Likert-type
statements followed, and then a new section was introduced: ‘With regard to ongoing biomedical research, what priority
would you give the following: Sex prede

238 Hartley and Pietraczyk

termination. . . .”” Choices included: (1)
high priority, (2) moderate priority, (3)
low priority, (4) prohibit, and (5) no
opinion.

RESULTS

Initial response patterns to the three
basic questions on sex predetermination
are reported in Table 1. Of our respondents, 65.9 per cent checked some level of
agreement with the idea that if predetermination of the sex of offspring becomes
possible, the procedure should be available to all parents. Yet, when the respondents were asked if they would want to use
such a procedure, only 44.6 per cent
answered affirmatively. In coding the
questionnaires, it was clear that many respondents had different attitudes on the
general as opposed to the personal aspects
of the issue.’

When it came to giving a priority to the
ongoing biomedical research in this area,
less than 10 per cent of these respondents
gave this item a high priority. Moderate to
low priorities were the overwhelming
choice. Indeed, it appears that a different
dimension has been tapped in the importance of ongoing research. Nevertheless,
while this technology does not achieve
highest ranking, neither does it have many
detractors, with only 13.5 per cent wanting to prohibit the research altogether.
(Six of nine biomedical research areas had
higher proportions of respondents willing
to prohibit research.)

Comparing these results with the ear
?Although our respondents were assumed to
have little knowledge about the specific techniques
of sex preselection, when we took a before-after survey of students in a class in genetic engineering, we
found that detailed knowledge of the various techniques did not alter attitudes of respondents. Also,
biology majors were not vastly different from others
in response patterns.

Statistical significance levels, when given here,
are listed for reference only, as the sampling requirements necessary for reliance on these tests of
significance are very rarely met in survey research.

 

Social Biology

lier report of a college-age Florida sample
(Markle and Nam, 1971), and with the National Fertility Survey of married women
(Westoff and Rindfuss, 1974), we find we
have a much higher level of acceptance.
Whether we focus on the proportion who
might want to use techniques of sex predetermination or the nearly 66 per cent who
would be open to the possible use by any
and all parents, the favorable attitudes exceed by far the 38.8 per cent of women in
the 1970 National Fertility Study who said
they were “for” the possible choice of sex
of a child (Westoff and Rindfuss, 1974, p.
635) or the 26 per cent of college students
“favorable” on the Florida survey. It may
be that attitudes toward preselecting the
sex of offspring are becoming more favorable over time, or that our California respondents are more open to the technique, or that we are seeing a combination
of these possibilities.*

HYPOTHESES TESTED

On the basis of reported research, our
three pretests, and a general familiarity
with previous studies of fertility, we had
hypothesized that:

1. Males would be more likely than females to indicate favorable attitudes toward
sex predetermination.

2. Nonwhites would be more likely than
whites to favor sex predetermination.

3. Married respondents would be more
likely than single respondents to favor sex
predetermination.

4. Respondents without children would
be less likely than those with children to indicate favorable attitudes toward sex predetermination.

5. Respondents reporting no religious
preference would be most likely, Protestants next most likely, and Catholics least
likely to favor sex predetermination.

6. Those who report little or no church
attendance would be more likely than those

“We will be attempting a follow-up survey with
some of our 1977 respondents as well as studying a
small new sample, so that we may be able to report
attitude change over time on several of these issues.

7. The higher the educational and class
level of respondent, the less favorable the
attitude would be toward sex selection.

8. The higher the indicated level of
confidence in the people running the medical and scientific communities, the more favorable would be the attitudes toward sex
predetermination.

9. Those giving high priorities to other
research in reproductive engineering would
be most likely also to give a high priority to
ongoing research into sex predetermination
of offspring.

Responses to our three core questions
were cross-tabulated with nominal level
variables such as sex, race, marital status,
religious background, etc. Nonparametric
correlations compared the ordinal level
measures on the core questions with variables such as age, educational level and
goals, church attendance, social class,
level of confidence in the people running
medical and scientific organizations, and

willingness to leave these decisions to
biomedical researchers. Controls were introduced in the final stages of analysis in
both the tabular and correlational formats.

With regard to the first hypothesis,
overall male/female differences were not
in evidence. Unlike the college sample of
Markle and Nam (1971) or our own adult
sample, this larger sampling showed remarkable similarity for the sexes on each
question. Comparing male-female responses within racial groups however,
highlighted some curious results. Both
black and Oriental women were more
likely than their male counterparts to
strongly favor sex predetermination. We
also found statistically significant
differences by parenthood for the first two
relevant questions. Men without children
but women with children were most likely
to strongly agree that sex predetermination should be available to all parents and

that they might want to use such a procedure.

Racial and ethnic differences (Hypothesis 2) were found to be statistically
significant for each question regarding the
predetermination of sex of offspring.
Tables 2, 3, and 4 report the proportional
responses to each question. It should be
noted that although black and Latino respondents were most likely to strongly
agree that sex predetermination should be
available to all parents (Table 2), the
Oriental respondents were most likely
(73.6 per cent) to agree overall and least
likely to strongly disagree. Racial
differences were somewhat greater for females and reduced among males. The
black/white differences were also increased for those at the lowest educational
levels (twelve or fewer years of formal
education) and virtually disappear among
graduate students. Whites who had lived

most of their lives in the southeastern or
southwestern United States reported attitudes like those of black respondents.

When asked if they might want to predetermine the sex of their own offspring
(Table 3), blacks again were most likely to
strongly agree, though this difference was
exaggerated among females and disappears among males. In this case, Latinos
are least likely to strongly agree, but
Orientals are again most likely to agree
overall and least likely to strongly disagree. Educational levels had an unexpected influence in that while blacks with
twelve or fewer years of formal education
were again most likely to strongly agree,
both blacks and whites who were graduate
students were more likely to agree or
strongly agree than was true for those in
the middle years of college.

Racial differences were greatest on the
issue of assigning priorities to ongoing

biomedical research into the predetermination of the sex of children (see Table
4). Blacks were clearly very much more
likely than any other category to grant
high priority to perfecting this technology.
While black women were three times as
likely as white women to grant high priority, black males were twice as likely as
white males to give the research highest
priority. Whites who lived most of their
lives in the south were twice as likely as
whites from the western United States to
highly value this procedure. Respondents
at the lower and higher levels of college
inflated the racial differences reported
overall. The Oriental respondents were
least likely to want to prohibit the research. Surprisingly, blacks were most
willing to prohibit (less likely to take a
moderate position about) ongoing research into methods of sex predetermination of offspring.

Following the research of Markle and
Nam (1971, p. 79), we had hypothesized
that married respondents would be more
likely than unmarried to favor sex predetermination. With about twice as many respondents, and four times as many evermarried respondents as Markle and Nam,
we found statistically significant
differences by marital status on all three of
our questions (see Tables 2, 3, and 4).
However, the most agreeable groups were
those who were cohabiting, widowed, separated or divorced, and then married and
single. The relationship between priority
given to Sex predetermination and marital
status disappeared when we controlled for
presence or absence of children. Those
with some children were more likely (13.5
per cent) than those with no children (8.4
per cent) to give highest priority to perfecting methods of predetermining sex of
offspring. With regard to the number of

children the respondents already had,
there was a Statistically significant negative correlation (r=0.076) between the
number of children and agreement with
the availability of sex predetermination to
potential parents. In examining the data in
detail, however, we found that the relationship was not linear. Those reporting
that they already had one or three children
were most likely to strongly agree to making generally available the techniques of
sex predetermination. Of those with three
children, 30 per cent strongly agreed that
they might want to use the techniques,
while those with only one child were very
much more likely than those at any other
parity to give a high priority to ongoing research into predetermination of the sex of
offspring. These results fit very nicely with

the strong preferences for sex balancing
reported in the National Fertility Study.
Of parents of one child, whether it was a
boy or girl, 80 per cent wanted the next
child to be the opposite sex.

Hypothesis 5 suggests that respondents
reporting no religious preference would
be most likely to favor and consider using
methods of predetermining the sex of
offspring. While the proposition appears
to find some confirmation in the case of
availability of technologies, respondents
of Jewish background were about as likely
as those without affiliation to either
strongly agree or agree on general availability and on their own possible use of sex
predetermination. Catholics were not
significantly different from Protestants in
response patterns. The variation in prioriDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

ties given to ongoing research in this area
by religious categories was also very small.
The insignificant differences according to
Catholic-Protestant religious background
are difficult to reconcile with the responses
of the Florida respondents of Markle and
Nam (1971) or of those of Largey (1972).
The greater racial/ethnic dispersion of our
sample does not help to explain the less
dramatic variation in response pattern by
religious category.

Church attendance (Hypoth-sis 6)
turns out to be far more powerfully related
to the range of attitudes under study than
type of affiliation. The more frequent
church attendance was reported to be, the
less agreeable respondents were to sex
preselection in general, their own potential use of techniques, or to ongoing research in the area. All of these correlations were statistically significant (see
Table 5). The significant negative relationship we found for all three questions
by church attendance was increased when
controls were introduced for education,
socioeconomic status, age, and/or
confidence in scientific leaders. Thus,
church attendance appears to be one of
the most strongly related variables to attitudes toward sex predetermination.

In spite of the fact that Markle and
Nam (1971) reported more favorable attitudes toward use of sex predetermination
for those with more years of college education, we hypothesized that the higher
the class level and education, the lower
the enthusiasm expressed for the ability to
preselect the sex of offspring. Our reasoning was that as years of education increase, people are less concerned with the
sex of offspring (Uddenberg et al., 1971).
Table 5 reports the statistically
insignificant, low, nonparametric correlations. The educational level of both
mother and father was significantly and
universally related (p=0.001) to the respondents’ willingness to consider using

Preselecting the Sex of Offspring 243

methods of sex predetermination. The
subjective class level of respondents was
unrelated to the attitudes at issue.

Our Hypothesis 8 suggests that the
higher the level of confidence expressed in
the leaders of science and medicine, the
greater the acceptance of research into
and procedures of sex predetermination.
Indeed, on all three questions the correlations were statistically significant (see

Table 5).

The highest overall correlations were
expected and found to be those in which
attitudes toward sex preselection were
compared to nine other research priority
items, including ongoing research aimed
at reduction of physical and mental handicaps, development of technologies to aid
subfecundity, such as development of
sperm banks, embryo transfers, etc., and
future technologies such as cloning. While
these numerous correlations are not listed
in detail, al/ were found to be statistically
significant at the 0.001 level.

SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS

We found a majority of respondents
agreeing that the technology of sex predetermination should be available to all
parents, that almost half would consider
using such procedures themselves, but
that priorities given to ongoing biomedical
research for the perfecting of these techniques tends to be low to moderate rather
than high. Contrary to our hypothesis,
males were not more likely than females
to favor sex selection. While blacks were
consistently more likely than whites to respond favorably, Latinos and Orientals
were typically in-between, but less likely
to strongly agree when their own use was
in question.

Although married respondents were
more likely than singles to agree to the
availability and their own possible use of
methods of predetermining sex, those
who were divorced, separated, widowed,

or cohabiting were even more agreeable.
There was some indication of a relationship between the number of children reported by respondents and agreement
with sex selection, although parents of one
or three children were most favorable to
one or more of the questions posed.
Religious identification was unrelated
to opinions reported (contrary to previous
research), but frequency of church attendance was, as hypothesized, significantly
related to attitudes expressed. Educa
tional level and subjective social class

were not significantly related to the questions on sex selection. The proposed relationships with levels of confidence in
scientific and medical leadership were
consistently and significantly manifest, as
were the correlations with priorities given
to other types of reproductive engineering.

Our respondents were overwhelmingly
more favorable to all questions on sex selection than those in the Florida sample of
Markle and Nam (1971) or those of the
Nationa) Fertility Study reported by
Westoff and Rindfuss (1974). Whether
this indicates a change over time, a more
lenient California population, or undetermined factors cannot be determined. We
will need more representative national
surveys to settle that point.

What are the implications of a general
acceptance of the idea of preselecting the
sex of children? As the techniques do become available, and if some are relatively
inexpensive, we would have to anticipate
that some unknown proportion of the
population of each nation would make use
of the new technology. Even a minority of
parents using the procedures could produce significant social changes within the
United States and/or around the world.

We have already seen that of 100
Chinese couples offered amniocentesis for
sex prediction and abortion for sex selection, 29 couples conceiving a female fetus

Hartley and Pietraczyk

Social Biology

and one couple conceiving a male chose to
abort the fetus. The mass of research on
son preference should not be dismissed
lightly. Let us examine some of the possible repercussions if some parents opt to
use sex preselection:

(1) First-child patterns would change,
even if a balanced overall sex ratio continued. In most countries, the male is preferred as a first child. If males predominate as first borns, sex-role stereotyping
could become more firmly entrenched.
Evidence indicates that first borns are
likely to be given more responsibility and
more likely to be leaders, to “succeed,”
than later borns even within the same family. And, since ‘‘bossiness, assertiveness,
hyperactivity, and quarrelsomeness appear to be characteristics more typical of
boys than girls’’ (Elder and Bowerman,
1963, p. 901; see also Koch, 1955), parental control and physical punishment could
change with an increase in first-born
males.

(2) Sex ratios would probably change,
with a slight predominance of males in the
more advanced industrial countries and a
heavy preponderance of males in the lessdeveloped, patriarchal nations. In Euro
‘pean countries there is a trend toward

one-child families, with high son preference for an only child. Thus, even in smallfamily nations, some imbalance is likely to
occur. All-male juvenile gangs, delinquency, and violence could increase. The
average age of marriage for males would
probably increase, and since the shortage
of females might make younger brides attractive, the age difference between husband and wife could increase, possibly
leading to greater male decision-making
and increased dependency of wives. On
the other hand, the relative shortage of females could mean that they would become
more valued. Over time we could anticipate some movement toward daughter
preference, and eventually a new balance

Vol. 26, No. 3

in the sex ratio. A higher proportion of
men who never marry and an increase in
homosexuality are also possibilities.

Within the less developed countries,
the sex ratio could be expected to be more
dramatically altered, depending upon the
proportion of parents actually using techniques of sex preselection. Assuming that
a son-biased technology would be the first
developed and marketed, Mason and
Bennett (1977) used survey data on the
ideal number of children and the ideal
number of sons for four countries in a
computer program which followed a progression of couples through the childbearing experience, assuming optimal
parental choice of sex probabilities at each
Stage in the process. They concluded that
for countries with very strong son preferences, such as India or Korea, the sex ratios could be very high indeed, 1.86 and
1.69, respectively. Any use of a son-biased
technique, moreover, would increase the
sex ratios of even those populations that
are unbiased or actually prefer more
daughters (1.24 ~1.40). Campbell suggests
that even a small rise in one sex over the
other “particularly if cumulative, could
upset society sexually, psychologically,
morally, politically, economically, and
unpredictably’ (Campbell, 1976).

In those countries where the majority
of persons depend upon the land for a living, a preponderance of sons might actually help families better feed themselves. That would assume the land is not
already overworked and is capable of producing more food with more male hands
(not true for much of Asia). At least in
those countries, the girls that were born
(as part of ashort supply) might be wanted
and less likely to be cases of neglect.

At the same time, sex-linked diseases
that dominate in the male of the species
would be propagated, possibly creating a
higher infant mortality rate, and/or a
higher incidence of sex-related disabili

ties. Males are more likely to die at every
age from childhood diseases, accidents,
cancer, heart disease, war, murder, and
suicide than females. Although it is to be
supposed that the shortage of girls would
lead over the long run to an increased demand and eventual near-balance in the sex
ratio, the short-run could be chaotic if the
desire for sons is manifest in choicebehavior of parents.

(3) Another tmportant possible consequence is in changing family size and national and international population
growth rates. In the more developed nations, couples would be helped to achieve
the most popular family structure: one son
and then one daughter. There would
probably be a significant decrease in the
numbers of three- and four-child families
in the United States and Europe and a
small to moderate decline in birth rates
(Dawes, 1970; Keyfitz, 1971).

Among the less developed nations with
very high birth rates, the choice of sex of
offspring could bring parents to lower
their total fertility in a very short period of
time. The technology could facilitate
known parental desires. The production
of sons could be a more expedient route to
population control than the attempt to
lower the total number of children desired. John Postgate, a microbiologist at
the University of Sussex, suggests that sex
control is the only method of depopulation for the Third World that has a “bat’s
chance in hell’ of deflecting Doomsday,
since it would take advantage of the ‘“‘ignorance and short-sightedness of the
world’s poor” (Postgate, 1973). While the
statement may be inelegant, it is also to
the point. Sex selection could rapidly decrease the net fertility of these populations
by reducing the numbers of daughters in
the younger generation and decreasing
the number of potential mothers in the
next generation.

We cannot know the outcome of develDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

oping the techniques of sex selection, but
new research in the whole area of attitudes
and behavior has begun. Data on the sex
preselection counseling clinic in Singapore (using the Shettles technique) should

be available soon, and that may offer information for an urban area that has both
high levels of fertility control and high son
preference. It will be interesting to observe the outcome over time.
