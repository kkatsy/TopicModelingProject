Maternal Age, Gravidity, and Pregnancy Spacing
Effects on Spontaneous Fetal Mortality

ABSTRACT: Differentials in the probability of pregnancy loss are examined using pregnancy
history data from eight WFS surveys in developing countries. Multiple logistic regression
equations are estimated. The probability of loss varies substantially over the reproductive
career. Both higher-order pregnancies and those conceived at older ages are more likely to
terminate in loss. Maternal age differentials are more pronounced for lower-order pregnancies.
First and second pregnancies conceived over age thirty suffer especially high levels of loss.
Pregnancies conceived relatively soon after the termination of the previous pregnancy are more
likely to be lost, as are pregnancies conceived after long intervals. Risk of loss is higher for
women previously experiencing loss, and the effect persists beyond the pregnancy following the

loss.

Fetal loss is a major source of the discrepancy between the amount of unprotected exposure to risk of conception
and levels of human fertility (Henry,
1964). Clinical evidence indicates that
approximately 60 per cent of fertilized
ova in human females do not result in a
live birth. Of fertilized ova that implant
in the uterus, approximately 35 per cent
do not survive long enough to cause a
delayed or missed menstrual period,
and thus are ordinarily never recognized
(Schlesselman, 1979). Of the pregnancies which can be recognized, roughly 20
to 25 per cent result in spontaneous fetal
losses, including stillbirths (Leridon,
1977).

In fertility analysis, spontaneous
pregnancy loss is conventionally regarded as a given, one of a complex of
factors determining the maximum level
of fertility (Bongaarts and Potter, 1983).
The implicit assumption is that rates of
fetal loss are roughly constant across

 

populations. There is, in fact, no firm
evidence verifying this assumption
(Leridon, 1977; WHO, 1970), and thus
the possibility of significant differentials
between populations cannot be rejected
out-of-hand. Known relationships between the prevalence of venereal disease and levels of sterility, for example,
could be in part the consequence of differences in rates of fetal loss, since infections of the reproductive system are
thought to increase the risk of loss
(WHO, 1970; see evidence from central
Africa in Retel-Laurentin, 1973).

More likely than differences between
population groups in levels of fetal loss
are inherent differences between
women (Leridon, 1977; Naylor, 1974)
and differences between pregnancies at
different stages of the reproductive career, as indexed by age or gravidity
(WHO, 1970). The former may account
for some of the unexplained variation
between women in reproductive perfor

mances; but, for the time being, it is difficult to envisage development of practicable means of measuring these
unobserved levels of risk. Variation
over the course of the reproductive career is more readily examined and 1s the
principal focus of this article.

There is a dispute about the relationship between fetal loss and the principal
indices of stage of reproductive career.
Previous empirical analyses have, without important exception, found the risk
of loss to be greater for pregnancies to
older women, and for pregnancies of
higher order (Awan, 1975; Kieley et al.,
1986; Leridon, 1976; Naylor, 1974;
Nortman, 1974; Pebley et al., 1985; Shapiro et al., 1970; Yerushalmy et al.,
1956).! These findings do not necessarily
imply increasing probability of loss as
maternal age and pregnancy order rise.
James (1963, 1968, 1974) has pointed
out that the observed relationships with
maternal age and pregnancy order
would appear if pregnancies at advanced ages and higher orders occurred
disproportionately to women at higher
risk of loss. This finding could occur if
loss itself prompted pregnancies at older
ages (efforts to achieve target family
sizes) and of higher order (shortened
pregnancy intervals, due to losses, resulting in a larger number of pregnancies), or if common sets of factors (e.g.,
socioeconomic status) influenced both
the probability of loss and the probability of becoming pregnant at later ages
and higher orders. James (1968, 1974)
reports analyses which suggest that such
artifactual processes are the primary

1Some of the same studies provide evidence of
higher risk of loss before age twenty and for first
pregnancies, but these results are not universal,
and the estimated effects of young age and first order are typically rather small.

cause of the observed relationships with
age and order, but other empirical research is not consistent with James’ argument (Naylor, 1974; Leridon, 1976).
Moreover, there is clinical evidence that
some of the suspected causes of fetal
deaths are positively associated with age
and possibly order (James, 1974; Naylor, 1974; WHO, 1970).

All of the pertinent sets of factors are
not easily taken into account. Tests for
genuine age and order effects clearly
must examine probabilities of loss over
the reproductive career, i.e., the woman
or pregnancy history must be the unit of
analysis. Ordinarily, however, pregnancy history data for contemporary
populations are collected from crosssections of reproductive-age women,
few of whom have completed their
childbearing at the time of the interview. Analysis can be restricted to
women at the older reproductive ages.
But the data for such women often suffer from omissions of events in the more
distant past, which itself will result in an
impression of positive age and order effects. A further confounding factor in
populations where fertility control is exercised is that pregnancy progression
may be contingent on pregnancy outcome (Billewicz, 1973). As noted
above, this can lead to a selectivity for
high risk of those conceiving at older
ages and higher orders. Estimated order
effects can also be more subtly distorted
if there is a tendency to stop childbearing with a successful outcome. Last
pregnancies will then show lower loss
rates.

Finally, adding to these complexities
is the practical consideration that most
pregnancy loss data either do not distinguish spontaneous and induced losses,
or, where they are recorded separately,
a significant proportion of induced

losses are likely to be misreported as
spontaneous losses. Because induced
abortion is a method of volitional fertility control, often it ts positively associated with maternal age and pregnancy
order (Tietze, 1981).

Pregnancy spacing is a feature of the
reproductive career which has received
relatively less attention than age and order in the analysis of pregnancy loss.
The interval between births is now recognized as an important determinant of
infant and child mortality (see Hobcraft
et al., 1984; Pebley and Millman, 1986).
Previous analyses of pregnancy loss reveal that risk is highest for pregnancies
following relatively short and relatively
long intervals, with the probability of
loss being lowest when the interval
ranges between 12 and 23 months (measured from month of termination of the
previous pregnancy to month of conception) (Swenson and Harper, 1978; Shapiro et al., 1970; Yerushalmy et al.,
1956). The increased rate of loss at
longer intervals could result from reproductive impairments which affect both
the probability of conception and the
probability of loss, the existence of unreported (and perhaps unrecognized)
losses reflective of a greater propensity
to spontaneously abort, or the presence
of induced losses among spontaneous
losses.

Clearly, age, order, and interval
length are associated. Higher-order
pregnancies must occur at relatively
later ages, and almost all first pregnancies occur before age thirty in developing countries. Pregnancy spacing can be
regarded as a form of age-order interaction. A simple interaction of the two
does not entirely determine pregnancy
spacing, however. The onset of childbearing varies over a range of ten years
or more in many societies, so that the co
Social Biology

variation of age and order is far from
perfect. Moreover, although average
prior pregnancy intervals are a simple
function of age at first pregnancy, pregnancy order, and age at the pregnancy in
question, there 1s room for considerable
variation beyond the second pregnancy
in the length of any particular interval.
Nevertheless, the empirical associations
among age, order, and interval length
can be expected to be strong enough so
that observed effects of any one could
represent in part disguised effects of one
or both of the others.

In this article, we examine pregnancy
history data collected in the World Fertility Survey (WES) in eight developing
countries. Our principal objective is to
consider the relative importance of maternal age, pregnancy order, and pregnancy spacing as determinants of spontaneous fetal loss. There are few, if any,
previous studies which have systematically considered effects of all three of
these determinants. We take account of
the associations among the three by
fitting multivariate equations; we also
analyze disaggregated one-way and
two-way tables as a means of monitoring
and pursuing further the outcome of the
multivariate modelling. Effects of maternal education and type of place of residence are also estimated for evidence of
differentials in completeness of reporting of losses and/or in the inclusion of induced losses. The article concludes with
an examination of some of the characteristics of pregnancy loss histories.

neous and induced loss, as the conventional wisdom was that coverage of
these events is inevitably seriously incomplete in retrospective maternity history data. Assessment of the coverage in
WES surveys confirms a significant level
of omission. The highest rates of spontaneous loss obtained from nonclinical
studies range from 20 to 24 per 100 pregnancies after the fourth gestational
week (Erhardt, 1963; French and Bierman, 1962; Shapiro et al., 1970). These
estimates are obtained by life table
methodologies which account for variation in the timing (with respect to gestational duration) of entrance to observation. Crude rates of loss—total losses
divided by total observed pregnancies—
from the same studies range from 10 to
15 per 100 pregnancies, and these are
the proper standard for assessing retrospective pregnancy history estimates.
By this standard, we conclude that 50 to
80 per cent of fetal losses have been detected in WFS surveys (Casterline,
1989).

For this analysis we select eight countries where the coverage appears relatively complete: Ivory Coast, Tunisia,
Syria, Korea, the Philippines, Costa
Rica, Mexico, and Guyana. (For details
about the design of the eight surveys and
the basic findings, see Central Bureau of
Statistics, 1982; Direccion General de
Estadistica, 1979; Direccion General de
Estadistica y Censos, 1978; National
Bureau of Statistics, 1977; National
Census and Statistics Office, 1979;
Office Nacional du Planing Familial et
de la Population, 1982; Statistical Bureau, 1980.) The countries are purposely chosen not only on the basis of
the reported level of loss, but also to
provide a diversity of societal and demographic settings. In terms of the prevalence of volitional fertility control, at

one end of the spectrum are the Ivory
Coast and Syria, which appear to be
largely natural fertility populations; at
the other end fall Korea and Costa Rica,
which show the most controlled fertility
regimes among the 41 developing countries surveyed in the WFS.

In each of the countries, women of
reproductive age were asked to provide
the date of termination of all pregnancies. (In Syria, Korea, and the Philippines, only ever-married women were
interviewed; elsewhere, women of all
marital statuses were interviewed.) The
format of the maternity history varied
among the eight countries (Singh,
1984). Elsewhere we conclude that the
format per se did not substantially affect
the coverage of pregnancy losses (Casterline, 1988). Under every format, respondents were asked for the calendar
month and year of all pregnancy terminations. Failing to obtain the calendar
date, the interviewer was instructed to
ascertain the number of years since the
termination and, as a last resort, the
birth interval for pregnancy losses.”

Early fetal losses (miscarriages, induced abortions) and late fetal losses
(stillbirths) are distinguished in all eight
countries. We treat miscarriages and
stillbirths together as ‘‘spontaneous”’
losses. Stillbirths comprise one-quarter
or less of all losses in each country. In
two of the countries—Syria and
Guyana—miscarriages and induced
losses were not reported separately. The
levels and differentials in these two
countries strongly suggest the presence
of a substantial proportion of induced
losses (Casterline, 1988). We include

random procedure. It is likely that imputation was
required more often for losses than live births
(Casterline, 1988).

the two countries in this analysis as illustration of the impact on the estimates of
an almost certain mixing of spontaneous
and induced losses.

Analysis of pregnancy loss requires
some departures from the conventions
of analysis of fertility survey data. First,
to place pregnancy losses and live births
on an equal footing, we date in terms of
month of conception (assuming a fixed
nine-month gestation period for all live
births) and count multiple births as one
pregnancy. Second, to avoid truncation
bias, pregnancies conceived in the nine
months preceding the survey date are
excluded from consideration. The sample consists of conceptions in the period
10 through 128 months preceding the
survey date. Estimates of rates of loss by
historical period suggest relatively less
omission of losses during this reference
period (Casterline, 1988).

In countries where spontaneous and
induced losses are distinguished (Syria
and Guyana are the exception), pregnancy outcome is a three-category variable: live birth, spontaneous loss, induced loss. Multiple regression analysis
is considerably simplified when the dependent variable is a dichotomy. In the
Ivory Coast, the Philippines, Costa
Rica, and Mexico, reported induced
losses comprise 1 per cent or less of
pregnancies and thus are of little concern. However, in countries where induced losses constitute a higher proportion of all outcomes (Tunisia, 3.5 per
cent of losses; and Korea, 25.4 per cent
of losses) their treatment in the analysis
of spontaneous loss will affect the
results. As there is some evidence that
reported induced losses occur on average at earlier gestational durations than
do spontaneous losses (Casterline,
1988), we exclude induced losses from
the sample. This is far from an optimal

Social Biology

solution to the analytic problems introduced by the multiple loss outcomes.

We fit multiple logistic regression
equations, with pregnancy outcome as
the response. Omitting subscripts, the
statistical model is

LnE(PI(1—P)) = Xb

where Ln denotes the natural logarithm
transformation, E is the mathematical
expectation operator, P is the probability of pregnancy loss, X is a vector of explanatory variables, and b is the vector
of parameters to be estimated. The data
are assumed to be binomially distributed. The statistical significance of particular terms is judged through a chiSquare test on the difference in
goodness-of-fit between equations including and excluding the term in question. All of the explanatory variables are
entered into the equations as categorical
variables. To identity the equations, the
parameter for the first category of each
variable is omitted. The coefficients for
the other categories thus represent differences (in Ln (P/1—P)) (i.e., in the
“logit of fetal death’) between the category in question and the omitted cate
gory.

RESULTS

We first examine unadjusted levels of
spontaneous loss by categories of maternal age, pregnancy order, pregnancy interval, maternal schooling, and type of
place of residence (Table 1). The percentage distributions of all pregnancies
according to these variables are presented in Table 2. The overall level of
loss ranges from 7.1 per cent in Korea to
17.4 per cent in Guyana. The relatively
low level in Korea is probably explained
by the high level of induced abortion

ceived in this period, according to respondents’ reports), as induced abortions are selective of those pregnancies
more likely to be aborted spontaneously
(higher order, older maternal age). The
relatively high level of overall loss in
Guyana is probably the consequence of
the presence of induced losses, which
are not distinguished from spontaneous
losses in the data from this country.

The differentials by demographic
characteristics are in conformity with
previous research. The risk of loss rises
with age and pregnancy order. Pregnancies conceived before age twenty are at
slightly greater risk in the Ivory Coast,
Tunisia, and Korea; first pregnancies
are at slightly greater risk in the Ivory
Coast, Kenya, Tunisia, Korea, the Philippines, and Costa Rica. But the additional rates of loss for these pregnancies
is minimal relative to the increased rates
at older ages and higher orders. The unadjusted percentage by length of interval since the previous pregnancy show a
U-shaped pattern, with pregnancies
conceived 16 to 35 months after termination of the previous pregnancy least
likely to end in a fetal death. In the Philippines and Guyana, the risk of loss for
pregnancies conceived after 35 months
is roughly the same as the risk for those
conceived after an interval of nine
months or less, indicative that the causes
of higher loss following longer intervals
must be rather powerful. In several
countries—Tunisia, Costa Rica, Mexico—long intervals are associated with
little additional risk of loss.

3Note in Table 2 that long intervals are slightly
more common in these three countries. We are reluctant to place much weight on subtle differences
between countries in the patterns by pregnancy interval, since the proportion of termination dates
imputed also varies between countries (Casterline,
1988).

 

Spontaneous Fetal Mortality

The differentials by maternal education are rather small in the Ivory Coast,
Tunisia, the Philippines, and Costa
Rica. In Syria, Korea, and Mexico,
better-educated women report a higher
percentage lost, whereas in Guyana an
inverse pattern emerges. The majority
of the Guyanese sample, however, falls
into the highest educational category.
Excepting Syria, Korea, and Mexico,
then, there is no evidence of markedly
better reporting, or of higher proportions of disguised induced losses, among
the better educated. Differentials by
type of place of residence are somewhat
sharper and more uniform, with rural
women in all eight countries reporting
the lowest rates of loss. As completeness
of reporting would seem more likely to
be associated with maternal education
than place of residence, we interpret the
latter differentials as reflective of a
higher incidence of induced loss (reported as spontaneous) in urban areas,
where abortion services are likely to be
more available.

ADDITIVE MopELs

We combine all five of the explanatory variables in Table 1 in an additive
equation. Statistical tests of the significance of each variable are summarized in
Table 3. Maternal schooling emerges as
the weakest predictor of the five, showing significant effects only in Syria, Korea, the Philippines, and Mexico. All
other variables test as significant, with
the exception of pregnancy order in the
Ivory Coast and residence in Korea.
The results demonstrate that it is reasonable to speak of independent effects
of factors such as maternal age and pregnancy order.

In order to consider the nature of the
net effects of each variable, we turn to

the parameter estimates presented in
Table 4. Recall that each coefficient represents a difference in the logit of the
probability of fetal loss between the category in question and the omitted category. On balance, the age effects seem
somewhat sharper than the order effects; only in Syria might the opposite
apply. Previous studies also suggest that
maternal age is more dominant (see
Yerushalmy et al., 1956; Nortman,
1974; Leridon, 1977.) In all countries,
pregnancies conceived at ages thirty and
over suffer greater loss, especially those
conceived at age forty and over.* Similarly, pregnancies of order ten and
above suffer disproportionate rates of
loss relative to orders three through six,
with the exception of the Ivory Coast
and Mexico. The absence of differentials by pregnancy order in the Ivory
Coast is interesting in view of the low
level of fertility control. In general, the
country differences do not suggest an attenuation of order effects due to selectivity of last pregnancies for successful
outcomes, a danger alluded to earlier.
On the contrary, if anything, order effects are weakest where fertility is less
controlled, as in the Ivory Coast and
Mexico.

An important question not directly
answered by Table 4 concerns the effect
of first pregnancies. First pregnancies
are represented in the equation by two
coefficients, that for pregnancies of order one to two and that for the first pregnancy category of the previous interval
variable. A first pregnancy effect can be
calculated from the two coefficients, but
comparison with higher orders requires
an assumption about the length of the
interval preceding the higher-order

‘These constitute 5 per cent or less of the sample pregnancies in every country, however. See
Table 2.

Social Biology

pregnancies (Table 5). Since the median
typically falls around fifteen months (see
Table 2), previous intervals of length 9
through 23 months are most relevant.
When the interval length is taken as 9
through 15 months, the risk of loss is
roughly the same for first and second
pregnancies in most of the countries. At
intervals between 16 and 23 months,
and 24 through 35 months as well, first
pregnancies are distinctly disadvantaged relative to second pregnancies,
except in the Ivory Coast and Mexico.
The probability of loss relative to pregnancies of order three through six varies. Only in Tunisia do first pregnancies
suffer much higher loss when the interval is set at 16 to 23 months, for example. Thus, conclusions about the relative
risk of first pregnancies depend on assumptions about the length of the interval preceding higher order pregnancies.
First pregnancies are uniformly disadvantaged relative to second pregnancies
only when the previous pregnancy interval falls between 16 and 35 months, and
this circumstance typifies a minority of
pregnancies. Compared to the majority
of pregnancies, which follow the preceding pregnancy by less than 16 months,
first pregnancies show no higher risk of
terminating in a fetal loss. (As we shall
demonstrate below, this conclusion
does not apply to first pregnancies occurring at older maternal ages.) This
finding is consistent with the bulk of previous evidence of weak first pregnancy
effects (Leridon, 1977).°

‘This summary statement applies especially to
evidence from developed countries (Shapiro et al.,
1970; Yerushalmy et al., 1956), including Naylor’s
(1974) study which incorporated an additive control for maternal age. Two studies from South
Asia, on the other hand, show distinctly higher
rates of loss for first pregnancies (Awan, 1975; Potter et al., 1965). Potter et al. suggest that young

The patterns of adjusted effects for
intervals since the previous pregnancy
largely resemble the unadjusted percentages, so we do not discuss these further. The same comment applies to the
differentials by maternal schooling and
place of residence. We note again that
the educational differentials test is statistically significant in four of the eight
countries, whereas place of residence is
significant everywhere except Korea,
further indication of the stronger association of pregnancy loss with residence
than with education of the mother.

We noted earlier that age and order
differentials need not imply increasing
risk of loss as maternal age and pregnancy order increase. The potential
sources of spurious patterns are complex and not easily controlled. However, several types of simpler tables provide a more demanding test of the
existence of the relationships apparent
in Tables 3 and 4. In Table 6, we consider the differentials by maternal age,
restricting attention to specific pregnancy orders. This serves as a control for
the possibility that experience at older
ages is distorted by the continued childbearing of women more likely to experience loss. The maternal age patterns evident here largely resemble those in
Table 4, except where small sample sizes
lead to unstable results. The incidence
of loss of pregnancies conceived over
age 40 is 1.5 to 2 times greater than the
loss at ages 30-34 in Korea, the Philippines, Mexico, and Guyana. In other
countries the positive age effect is less
sharp, but nevertheless distinct, with the

maternal age explains the higher loss of first pregnancies in the Punjab. The first pregnancy effects
considered here are adjusted for maternal effects,
which in any case appear to be minor before age
thirty.

exception of the Ivory Coast. Somewhat
higher rates of loss below age thirty in
most countries are probably the consequence of the short pregnancy spacing
implicit in this age-order interaction.
We pursue both maternal age and, in
particular, pregnancy order effects in
Table 7. A tendency for higher-order
pregnancies and pregnancies at older
maternal ages to be contributed disproportionately by women more likely to
experience loss is a plausible explanation of the estimated order and age effects (James, 1974). A more severe test
is provided by examination of differentials by order within pregnancy histories. This can be approximated by considering probabilities of loss by order for
women whose reproduction is largely
complete, namely women age 40-44 at
the survey, classified according to their
gravidity at the survey. Because age is
not controlled here, age effects will be
expressed in the order effects. Thus, this
analysis examines more generally the
pattern of loss over reproductive careers. It is clear from Table 7 that the
risk of loss rises with pregnancy order
among women of the same (completed)
gravidity (first two panels). Indeed,
comparisons with the overall pattern of
loss (i.e., without stratification by gravidity) shown in the final panel indicate
that the overall pattern is fairly well reproduced in the histories of women of
specific gravidity.° Consistent with the
earlier analysis, first pregnancies tend to
show a higher risk of fetal death. The effect is not uniformly apparent and is
rather small in magnitude in most instances. Note that memory loss effects
operate against reported higher loss of

The flat order-pattern in the Ivory Coast remains an anomaly.

first pregnancies and in favor of a monotonic rise in rates of loss with order.

With respect to the patterns of loss by
length of the preceding pregnancy interval, we asked two further questions.
First, to what extent is the length of
pregnancy interval a feature of women
or of births? If pregnancy intervals vary
little over a woman’s reproductive career, then perhaps pregnancy interval
effects proxy for other characteristics of
women which are the cause of higher incidence of loss. On the other hand, substantial within-woman variability in
pregnancy intervals strengthens the case
for assigning responsibility to effects of
interval length per se. We have again analyzed careers of women advanced in
their reproductive career as of the survey date (women aged 35-39 and 4044). A simple decomposition of variation in pregnancy intervals (defined as
months between termination and conception) reveals that 75 per cent or more
of the total variation occurs among intervals within careers of particular
women. Further multivariate analysis
suggests that the absolute length of the
previous pregnancy interval is a stronger
correlate of the probability of loss than
the mean interval length or the deviation of the previous interval from the
mean. The data strongly suggest that the
crucial variable is the absolute length of
the interval, which itself tends to vary
Over a woman’s career.

A second question is whether the
previous interval effect applies equally
well when the previous pregnancy survives through the gestation of the pregnancy in question and when the previous pregnancy dies before conception.
If the mechanism of the effect is depletion of maternal resources, one might
expect less strain on the mother when
the previous pregnancy does not survive

to conception. But recovery of certain
maternal resources may require fixed
periods of time regardless of fetal and
infant survival. The survival status of the
previous pregnancy is also an element in
an artifactual explanation of the interval
effect, which goes as follows. The probability of loss is greatly elevated following a loss (Leridon, 1976; see also analysis below). Moreover, the interval to the
next conception will on average be
shorter following a loss, due to a briefer
anovulatory period (especially in populations practicing extended breastfeeding). These two factors together contribute to an observed negative association
between interval length and the risk of
loss.

To consider this possibility, we reestimated the equations of Table 4 separately for pregnancies classified by the
survival status of the previous pregnancy (Table 8). Included among pregnancies not surviving to the next conception are fetal losses. Comparison of the
coefficients of Panel A with the corresponding coefficients in Table 4 reveals
no consistent differences. The estimated
interval effect is essentially unaffected
by the elimination of pregnancies preceded by a fetal loss or infant death.
Thus, we reject the artifactual explanation proposed above. Unfortunately,
sample size does not permit sound comparison of Panels A and B, which would
indicate whether survival of a previous
live birth through the pregnancy accentuates the interval effect, as a consequence of the physical strain of breastfeeding, for example (see evidence in
Swenson and Harper, 1978).

fects of the five explanatory variables.
There are reasons to suspect that this
formulation is inappropriate. For example, there is some suggestion in previous
work that maternal age and pregnancy
order interact. First pregnancies at older
ages, and higher order pregnancies at
younger ages, appear especially disadvantaged (Naylor, 1974; Nortman,
1974). Unusually high risks for higher
order pregnancies at younger ages are,
plausibly, the consequence of pregnancy spacing effects, but interactions
between first pregnancy and age might
well be genuine, reflecting physiological
difficulties in commencing reproduction
at advanced ages. Similarly, one might
posit interactions between the demographic variables and the socioeconomic
characteristics of the mother. To the extent that medical care can alleviate the
risks of loss, the demographic differentials might be attenuated for bettereducated and urban women, who are
more likely to make use of modern medical services. On the other hand, induced abortion is probably more common in these strata, and the reporting of
these as spontaneous losses would tend
to accentuate effects of demographic
characteristics.

In order to test for interactions, we
add terms representing two-way interactions to the additive equation estimated
earlier. The ten two-way interactions
are tested singly, i.e., ten estimations
per country. We collapse across categories of each variable, to avoid small cell
sizes in the two-way interactions.”

?The recoded variables are as follows: maternal
age, < 20, 20-29, 30 + ; pregnancy order 1-2, 3-6,
7+; pregnancy interval, <9, 9-23, 24+, first
pregnancy; maternal schooling, low, mid-high (excepting Korea, Philippines, and Guyana: low-mid,
high); residence, rural urban.

Spontaneous Fetal Mortality

 

203

The results of the statistical tests are
summarized in Table 9. Since a certain
fraction of effects will test as significant
due to chance alone, depending on the
significance level used as a criterion, we
consider only those interactions emerging as significant at the 0.10 level in three
or more countries. Thus, we conclude
that maternal schooling and residence
do not interact in affecting the probability of loss, nor does schooling interact
with maternal age or pregnancy order.
An interaction between schooling and
the length of the pregnancy interval is
apparent, however, as is a corresponding interaction between type of place of
residence and the pregnancy interval.
We have examined the parameter estimates for this interaction, in those countries where it is significant. An impressively uniform picture emerges. In all
cases, the interval effects are sharper for
less-educated and rural women. Bettereducated and urban women, in contrast,
show relatively weak associations between pregnancy spacing and the risk of
fetal loss. The mechanism underlying
this interaction is not clear; perhaps the
shorter breastfeeding durations of educated and urban women (Ferry and
Smith, 1983) is a partial explanation.

In contrast to maternal schooling,
residence interacts with maternal age
and pregnancy order. We have also examined these interactions in detail. The
results are not as uniform as those discussed above. In general, in the countries where these interactions are significant, they consist of sharper age and
order effects for urban women. The opposite holds in Guyana, however, where
the age and order effects are more pronounced for rural women. We speculate
that the sharper effects for urban
women in Syria, Korea, the Philippines,
and Mexico reflect the inclusion of in

duced losses among the pregnancies analyzed. Induced abortions are likely to
be more common in urban areas and
among women at older ages and higher
gravidities.

Table 9 indicates that the effects of
pregnancy interval are additive with
those of maternal age and pregnancy order.

Finally, we consider the interaction
between maternal age and pregnancy
order, which is of particular interest because of implications about preferable
timings of childbearing during the reproductive years. The results do indicate that significant interactions exist.
We have pursued this interaction further, exploring a variety of parameterizations in an effort to capture the interaction with the most parsimonious
specification. (Moreover, the rarity of
some combinations, such as higherorder pregnancies conceived before age
20, argues for collapsing the full interaction.) The full interaction may be
sketched as shown in Table 10. Cell 1 is
the omitted category under the parameterization we adopt. When the full interaction is fit, Cells 2 and 3 and Cells 4 and
7 are represented by the additive order
and age terms, respectively, and Cells 5,
6, 8, and 9 are represented by the terms
comprising the interaction. However, a

simpler equation, in which the interaction is represented by two additional parameters, captures the interaction and
yields more sensible patterns of effects.
The equation includes a term representing pregnancies of order three through
six conceived at ages 30+ (Cell8), anda
term representing pregnancies at order
seven and above conceived at ages 30 +
(Cell 9). That is, terms representing
these same two sets of pregnancy orders
at ages 20-29 are superfluous, probably
because of the lack of pregnancies at the
same orders under age 20, which serve
as a reference in the full interaction.

The patterns of effects derived from
estimating this equation are presented
in Table 11. The most salient feature of
the interaction is the elevated risk of loss
for first or second pregnancies conceived above age thirty. This conclusion
is based not on the absolute values
shown in Table 11, but rather on the age
differentials within each order. It is in
this respect that first pregnancies at
older ages are especially disadvantaged.
The difference in the probability of Joss
between pregnancies conceived before
and after age thirty is substantially
greater for first pregnancies than higherorder pregnancies in most of the countries (note the Ivory Coast, Tunisia, the
Philippines, Guyana, Costa Rica, Mexico). This same interaction is observed
by Kiely et al., (1986), Naylor (1974),
and Nortman (1974).

A second feature of the patterns of
effects in Table 11 is a heightened risk
for higher order pregnancies conceived
under age thirty. In contrast, at ages
over thirty, differentials by order are
small or absent. We interpret this result
as reflecting effects of pregnancy spacing beyond the impact of length of the
preceding pregnancy interval, which is
controlled. That is, there appear to be

cumulative spacing effects in addition to
the immediate impact of the time
elapsed between the previous pregnancy termination and the conception of
the pregnancy in question.

PREGNANCY Loss HISTORIES

Pregnancy history data permit analysis of the occurrence of pregnancy losses
in the context of a pregnancy history.
The effects of pregnancy spacing evidentin Tables 1,3, 4, and 8 demonstrate
the insight afforded by treating pregnancies as a Sequence of events over a woman’s reproductive career rather than as
independent occurrences. Whereas the
analysis in previous sections was restricted to pregnancies conceived in the
ten years preceding the survey, here we
examine the entire pregnancy history up
to the survey date.

We first consider the frequency of occurrence of losses over the pregnancy
history, using birth intervals as the unit
of observation. From Panel A of Table
12, it is evident that reported spontaneous pregnancy loss is a rare event. Only
in Guyana (where we suspect appreciable numbers of induced losses) do 10 per
cent or more of intervals contain a reported loss, and in the other countries
the figure is 7 per cent or less. This is a
lower percentage than the overall percentage of pregnancies terminating in
spontaneous loss, because of the higher
probability of a loss following a loss than
a live birth (a fact we consider below).
Indeed, as the figures in Panel B of Table 12 document, more than 10 per cent
of pregnancy losses were not isolated occurrences, but rather occurred in intervals in which one or more other losses
occurred. In some age groups in some
countries, as many as 20 per cent or
more of losses occurred along with one

 

Spontaneous Fetal Mortality 207

or more others. Guyana shows this tendency to the greatest extent.

Implicit in the comparison of Panels
A and B is the fact that the risk of loss is
higher following a loss. We now turn to
this matter, which has received considerable attention in other studies (Leridon, 1976; Naylor, 1974; Pantelakis et
al., 1973; Potter et al., 1975; Shapiro et
al., 1970; Yerushalmy et al., 1956). Our
findings reinforce the previous work. In
Table 13, we show the spontaneous loss
rates for sequences of three pregnancies
(all such sequences among pregnancies
one through fifteen, aggregated together). When the previous pregnancy
terminates in loss, the next pregnancy is
approximately three times as likely to
terminate in spontaneous loss in five
countries, the exceptions being the Philippines, Costa Rica, and Mexico. (The
risk is approximately four times greater
in Tunisia and Korea.) This conclusion
also applies to third pregnancies following a loss as compared to a live birth ina
sequence of which the first is a live birth.
When the first of a sequence of three is
lost, however, the probability of loss is
elevated for third pregnancies, compared to first pregnancies, whether the
second is a live birth or a loss (a finding
in agreement with Leridon, 1976). In
seven of the eight countries (except
Mexico) the relative risk of loss following a loss is reduced in this circumstance.
Finally, considering the two extreme sequences, we note that the probability of
loss following two live births is somewhat lower than the overall probability
of loss (as represented by “first pregnancy”’), but little less generally than the
probability of loss of asecond pregnancy
following a live birth. The probability of
pregnancy loss following two losses, on
the contrary, is substantially greater
than the probability of loss following

only one loss and approaches or exceeds
40 per 100 pregnancies in all countries
except the Philippines.

There are several explanations for
the increased risk of loss following a loss
(Potter et al., 1975). Two spurious relationships are candidates: selection of
women for completeness of reporting of
losses; or inclusion of induced abortions
as spontaneous losses, taking account of
the tendency for induced abortions to
repeat (Tietze and Jain, 1978). A genuine tendency for the risk of loss to be elevated following a loss can be a reflection
of heterogeneity among women in risk,
due to whatever genetic or behavioral
factors. In the data of Pantelakis et al.,
(1973), the incidence of premature
births increases following a spontaneous
or induced loss, which suggests anatomical defects as a contributory factor. Behaviorial factors, such as a tendency towards short pregnancy intervals, could
also easily play some role. The heterogeneity could consist of a subgroup of
women characterized by uniformly
higher risks, but a gradation of risk
seems more likely, perhaps following a
beta or negative binomial distribution
(Leridon 1977; Naylor, 1974).

DISCUSSION

It is clear that the probability of loss
varies over the reproductive career.
Pregnancies conceived at older ages and
higher order pregnancies are more
likely to end in Joss. This analysis provides no consistent evidence of higher
risk for teenage pregnancies, however,
or of higher risk for first pregnancies. A
finding with implications for decisions
about the timing of childbearing is the
more pronounced maternal age differentials for lower-order pregnancies.
First and second pregnancies conceived

Social Biology

at ages thirty and above suffer higher
levels of loss than expected on the basis
of the overall maternal age and pregnancy order effects.

The probability of loss is associated
with two features of the mother’s previous pregnancy history: the interval
elapsed since the termination of the
most recent pregnancy, and the occurrence of previous fetal deaths. Pregnancies conceived relatively soon after the
previous pregnancy are more likely to
be lost, as are pregnancies conceived after long intervals. This U-shaped relationship conforms with previous work
and can be understood as the consequence of several behavioral and biological factors. The relationship is weaker
for better-educated and urban women,
for unknown reasons. The data also suggest that there are effects of a succession
of relatively closely spaced pregnancies
in addition to the effect of the length of
the interval immediately preceding a
pregnancy. The increased risk for
women previously suffering loss is well
recognized. This analysis indicates that
the increased risk applies beyond the
pregnancy following a loss, but the effects are sharpest for this pregnancy.

We noted earlier that pregnancy loss
is commonly neglected in fertility research, in part because most spontaneous loss is assumed to be beyond volitional control, and in part because of the
known deficiencies in the data collected
i conventional fertility surveys. The
first assumption is not entirely correct,
A number of behavioral variables affect
the risk of loss (e.g., maternal smoking
and drinking during pregnancy; see
Cooksey, 1987). But even accepting the
validity of both arguments, the WFS evidence presented in this article suggests
that taking into account reported pregnancy losses measurably improves our
