Socioeconomic Correlates of Fertility

in the Metropolis: Relationship
of Individual and Areal

Unit Characteristics

Lewis Rhodes

Department of Sociology
Florida State University
Tallahassee, Florida

Demographers and sociologists continue
to evidence an interest in relationships between socioeconomic indicators and fertility (Duncan, 1964; Goldstein and Mayer,
1965; Kunz, 1965; Mitra, 1966a, 19665,
and 1966c; Blau and Duncan, 1967; for
earlier review of the literature see United
Nations, 1953). While many of the earlier
studies rely on correlations between fertility rates and the socioeconomic characteristics of areas to infer the relationship
between socioeconomic characteristics and
fertility rates of individual couples, more
recent studies have been concerned
with the interrelationship between status
characteristics of individuals vis-a-vis those
of areal units as they relate to fertility
(Westoff et al., 1961, 1963; Duncan,
1964; Goldstein and Mayer, 1965).

Students of the complex relationships
between fertility, age of wife, status indicators, and residence have called for a more
refined study of these relationships in a
variety of areas (Goldstein and Mayer,
1965, p. 309). This paper represents an
extension of the work reported by Duncan

 

(1964, p. 88) which concludes “analyses
in which areal classification is examined
simultaneously with several individual
classifications of socioeconomic characteristics suggest that areal differentiation in
fertility may not be completely reducible to areal clustered effects of some
conventional individual variables.” Specifically, the paper is directed at the question,
“Do levels of income and education in the
census tracts where couples reside add to
explained variance in fertility of couples
which is explained by individual characteristics like education of wife and/or income
of husband?” An early study of fertility
by type of residence suggests that some
relationship may exist between house type
and fertility (U.S. Bureau of the Census,
1948, Table 13; Westoff et al. 1961,
p. 272-273; Westoff, Potter, and Sagi,
1963, p. 160). The relationships between
fertility and wife’s education or husband’s
income have been reported in various
studies (Freedman, Whelpton, and Campbell, 1959, p. 288-302; Westoff et al.,
1961, p. 323; Westoff et al., 1963, p. 217;

Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson, 1966,
p. 96, 103, 104). Fertility level of tract is
also considered.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The study is concerned with comparing
the relationship between fertility and individual and/or census-tract characteristics.
The dependent variable is measured in two
ways: number of children under age five
per woman (Y;), and number of children
ever born per woman (Ye). The independent variables are: (X1) wife’s education—number of years of school completed;
(X2) husband’s income—annual income in
thousands of dollars; (X3) tract education
—per cent of persons age 25 and over in
tract (where couple resides) who completed
high school; (X4) tract income—median
income of the tract where the couple resides; (Xs) tract fertility—child-woman
ratio in the tract where the couple resides.
Age of wife is a control variable (Westoff
et al., 1961, p. 282-287; Westoff et al.,
1963, p. 199-200).

Data for this study are taken from a
larger study of fertility and occupational
mobility by Otis Dudley Duncan (“Diiferential Fertility and Social Mobility,”
supported by research grant no. GM10386, U.S. Public Health Service, 1962).
These data were collected by the USS.
Bureau of the Census as part of the March,
1962, Current Population Survey (Blau
and Duncan, 1967, p. 10-19) and supplied
in the form of tables because the basic
data source is held confidential by the
Bureau. The analysis is limited to white,
married couples living in the twelve largest
Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas of
the United States.

These couples were coded according to
three characteristics (cited above) of the
census tracts where they reside. Limitations
of time and resources prevented computa
Socioeconomic Fertility Correlates

tion of within-tract variances, gathering
information on additional characteristics
or obtaining similar information for other
categories of couples not included in this
study. Cross-tabulations giving number of
children per wife by individual and tract
characteristics for first-order relationships
were obtained from the Bureau of the
Census. Wives were divided into four age
groups: 22-26; 27-31; 32-36; 37-41.
These unorthodox intervals were not specified according to needs of the limited
analysis presented here; rather they were
intended to permit intracohort comparisons
with data from the 1960 census (which is
beyond the scope of the present study).

Both linear and curvilinear regression
techniques were attempted. However, the
analysis assumes that the relationships are
linear for a number of reasons. One is that
the confidence bands about the regression
lines are wide because the overall sampling
fraction is small, and corrections are added
which increase the width since it is impossible to accurately estimate variances in
subgroups on the basis of information supplied by the Bureau of the Census.

Attempts to fit second degree parabolas
were made, but addition of the squared
term did not make much contribution to
explained variance. Although F tests are
accomplished to evaluate the additional
reduction in total sum of squares due to the
addition of one or more independent variables in the regression problems, the results
of such tests should be interpreted with
great caution since the sample is not a
simple random one but an areal clustered
sample (Blau and Duncan, 1967, p. 18).
Hence, levels of statistical significance reported in the tables only provide crude,
“rule-of-thumb” estimates (the tests were
accomplished by underestimating sample
NV’s and acting as if the sample were a
simple random one). A brief summary of
results follows.

RESULTS

Zero-order relationships. The results from
the simple correlation analysis are consistent with those of previous studies (see
Tables 1 and 2). Looking at relationships
between fertility and individual characteristics, one sees that there is a significant negative relationship between children ever
born/wife and wife’s education. The relationship does not hold for number of children under age five/wife for older age
groups. Women in these age groups are less
likely to have children under age five.
There is little relationship between the
measures of fertility and husband’s (rather
than family’s) income which is consistent
with the findings of previous studies of

Socioeconomic Fertility Correlates

 

299

fertility patterns for whites (Freedman et
al., 1959, p. 293, 296)

It is apparent that characteristics of
tracts show less relation to fertility of individual women as the age of wife advances.
This seems reasonable given the expectation
that births are more likely to occur early
rather than late in the childbearing period
and the likelihood that a family will have

1A check on the reliability of the regression
analyses for children ever born by wife’s education or husband’s income was accomplished by
using the Bureau of the Census 1/1,000 computer
tape to produce tabulations roughly comparable
to those used here: white married couples (spouse
present) living in cities over 1,000,000 in size. The
intercepts, regression, and correlation coefficients
were sufficiently similar that one would not be
badly misled by substituting one set for the other.
Unfortunately the 1/1,000 data tape contained no
information on tracts.

their previous place of residence and their
current place of residence.

Subsequent analysis is restricted to white
married couples with wives in the youngest
age group. Looking at the left half of
Table 1, it is apparent that the fertility of
young wives is more closely correlated with
the fertility level of the tract in which they

 

reside than either wife’s education or husband’s income. This observation probably
reflects residential segregation by fertility
behavior and stage in the life cycle. The
results are somewhat different where number of children ever born is the dependent
variable (right-hand part of Table 1).
Wife’s education and educational level of

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:32 08 December 2015

302

tract are somewhat more closely related to
this measure of fertility than tract fertility.
Tract income is less closely associated with
either measure of fertility.

Multivariate analyses. Beta and multiple
regression coefficients were computed for
all regressions of possible combinations of
independent variables on the two measures
of fertility? (see Table 3). F tests were
accomplished as a crude indication of the
explanation gained by the addition of each
variable to the remaining variables in each
regression equation. In the case of children
under age five per woman, the relationships
with independent variables are not independent of one another, except for tract
fertility which makes a robust contribution
to variance in fertility. Tract income has
little effect on fertility, while tract education has slightly greater effect, particularly
in those equations which exclude one or
more of the other tract characteristics.
Although the contribution of husband’s
income is modest, it is partially independent of the effects of other variables.

The net regression coefficients for children ever born on these same variables
show change in their relative importance
(bottom half of Table 3). Wife’s education is most closely associated with this
fertility measure, with tract fertility and
tract education also making substantial
independent contributions to the explanation. (However, the effect of tract education is greater when wife’s education is not
included in the estimating equation.)

2 Also, cross-tabulations giving number of children per wife by individual and tract characteristics for first-order relationships were obtained
from the Bureau of the Census for women in the
four age groups. These first-order tabulations were
used to see if there might be a possible interaction
between an individual characteristic (e.g., wife’s
education) and a tract characteristic (e.g., level
of education in the tract of residence) beyond
their additive effect on fertility. Tests for interaction support the notion that effects of the independent variables are additive on both measures
of fertility.

Rhodes

Social Biology

Neither husband’s income nor tract income
make much of a contribution.

One must acknowledge that none of the
net coefficients are particularly large; but
one would hardly expect to explain much of
the variance given the variables employed
in the table. Nevertheless, the four variables in combination account for almost a
quarter of the variation in number of
children ever born (see bottom right
corner of Table 3).

Tract versus individual characteristics.
Another way of looking at the data in
Table 3 is to focus on which tract characteristic adds the most to individual characteristics in explaining variation in the
child/woman ratios. It is easily seen that
tract fertility makes the greatest independent contribution to variation in number
of children under age five (Y,) when
added to regressions of wife’s education
and/or husband’s income (compare r?y.; =
—0.0204, fr y.0 = 0.0097, and r-y.19 =
.0439 with appropriate R*’s in top of
Table 3). The results are similar when the
dependent variable is number of children
ever born (Ye) (Compare r?y.. = —0.1457,
rey. — —0.0015, and ry 10 = 0.1635
with appropriate R?’s in bottom half of
Table 3). However, tract education adds
somewhat more than tract fertility in regressions which exclude wife’s education.
Note that the combination of wife’s education with tract education and tract fertility (or just tract fertility) accounts for
nearly all of the explained variation in
number of children ever born.

Those who might wish to substitute
correlations of tract fertility ratios by tract
levels of education and/or income as a
substitute for (individual) correlations of
parity by wife’s education or husband’s
income would take little comfort from results of this study. In the case of fertility
by education the individual correlations are
stronger than the areal unit correlations
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:32 08 December 2015

Vol. 18, No. 3

while the reverse is true in the case of
fertility by income.®

DISCUSSION

These results give a partial answer to
the question of whether or not characteristics of areal units add anything to characteristics of individuals or families in
predicting fertility. The analysis has shown
that the levels of education and fertility in
census tracts in which white married
couples reside make a contribution to explained variation in fertility which is independent of the couples’ socioeconomic
status as indicated by wife’s education or
husband’s income. Both individual and
tract characteristics carry less weight in
the estimating equations for fertility of
wives in the older age groups.

Given the cross-sectional design, the data
are insufficient to support hypotheses concerning causal sequences. Although wife’s
education would usually precede choice of
neighborhood (tract in this case), numerous other factors affect residential choice,
one of which would be the birth of children.
Since various types and prices of housing

3 The necessary data for two-variable relationships can be gleaned from Tables 1 and 2. Tract
education and tract income together account for
more of the variance in tract fertility than couple
education and income account for variance in
parity. The R? for Y,+-X,X»y in the four age
groups youngest to oldest are 0.0439, 0.0094,
0.0000, and 0.0041; for Y, * X,X, they are 0.1635,
0.0476, 0.0214, and 0.0069. These are compared
with R2 for Xs ° X3X, which are 0.2185, 0.2798,
0.3375, and 0.2556.

are segregated, it seems likely that the
correlations and regressions reported in
this study reflect tract selectivity of persons at various levels of education or
couples at various stages of the family life
cycle. Presumably, the dormitory-type
suburb attracts persons with one or more
children while the area of small luxury
apartments attracts singles or couples with
no children. However, one would like to
know whether the relationships noted above
are entirely the product of tract selectivity
(residential segregation by stage of the life
cycle and size of family) or if there is some
milieu effect which cannot be identified in
this limited study. Would living in an area
where all couples have large numbers of
children cause a couple to have more children? The results of this study only hint at
the answer. Tract characteristics give a
more accurate estimate of number of children ever born per wife than of children
under age five per wife. Since the latter
is a better indicator of current fertility,
the segregation hypothesis receives greater
support than the normative (neighborhood
climate) hypothesis. Further study is needed
to test the merits of these alternative explanations.
