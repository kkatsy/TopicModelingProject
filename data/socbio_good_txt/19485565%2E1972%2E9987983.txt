Genetic Contributions to Morphological
and Behavioral Similarities among Sibs

Siblings and dizygotic (DZ) cotwins as
la group share approximately 50% of their
a genes in common, but a single pair may
® theoretically have a common inheritance
Sof zero to forty-six chromosomes (or por5 tions of chromosomes). In the case of sameS sex pairs, the theoretical range is from one
‘sto forty-six, but a more realistic range is
probably from 25% to 75% of the total
< genome, distributed around a mean of 50%.
-- To the extent that phenotypic physical
and behavioral characteristics are geneti>cally determined, the sib pairs who share a
more common inheritance should be more
ssimilar in appearance and behavior than
=those with fewer genes in common. An
oestimate of genetic differences between DZ
cotwins and siblings can be provided by red
blood cell factors that assort independently
between the members of a pair. Independent assortment of blood group factors is
evidence of their location on different chromosomes or of their location at great distances on the same chromosome.

Although the comparison of MZ and DZ
twins has often been reported, there has
been little exploration of the contribution
that a study of variability in common inheritance among sibs or DZ twins could
make to understanding genetic and environmental variances in behavior and
morphology. Two rather different approaches can be made to blood group and
behavioral-morphological data on DZ twins.
One approach looks for possible relationships between the number of blood-group
differences and the degree of cotwin dissimilarity in behavioral-morphological
traits. A second approach seeks genetic
linkages between blood group loci and specific behavioral-morphological differences.
This paper includes both approaches to
data on same-sex DZ twins.

We know of no previous study that has
explored the relationship between quantitative variation across many blood group
loci and variation in the behavior and
morphology of siblings and DZ twins. By
counting all definite allelic variations between cotwins, we sought to measure the
effects of total differences at the marker
loci sampled. By implication, those twins
with more numerous differences at the loci

The twins were tested by the Boston

those systems for which the twins were not

were tested, the following nine polymorphic o| fede iiniss marker systems remained: ABO, Rhesus ee

information to be gained from such blood
factors. Table 2 gives the maximum likelihood estimates of the gene frequencies
obtained from the sample.

MEASURES OF APPEARANCE AND BEHAVIOR

Two experimenters independently made
ratings on the physical similarity of the
twins by guessing their zygocity (in a
larger sample of MZ as well as DZ pairs)
and rating degrees of certainty in their
diagnoses. A scale from positively dizygotic
through questionable to positively monozygotic was constructed from their combined ratings. The mothers were also asked
to rate the zygocity of their own twins on
a simple MZ or DZ basis. Since judgments
were based almost entirely on morpho
logical characteristics, these ratings were
considered to reflect the degree of similarity
in appearance of the twins.

A large number of measures of personality and behavior were used in the study of
the twins. The 49 measures varied from
psychoanalytically-based motives to reaction times. Only the ten measures of reaction time and preferred levels of activity,
which were themselves intercorrelated, were
selected for analysis in this paper because
of their previously shown heritability. This
cluster of activity measures was described
in Scarr, 1966a.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Several different computer programs were
used to analyze the data. These are now

being organized into a single package in
order to facilitate future analyses of this
nature (Namboodiri and Siervogel, in preparation). The maximum likelihood gene frequency estimates given in Table 2 were
obtained, allowing for the sibling relationship between members of each pair, by a
numerical search of the likelihood surface
(Kaplan and Elston, 1972).

Association between the phenotypes of
each polymorphic marker system and each
activity measure was tested by a simple
one-way analysis of variance, the number
of classes being equal to the number of
different phenotypes for the marker system.
Since the sibling relationship was ignored
in this analysis, and since siblings will tend
to be more similar than random members
of the population for all phenotypic traits
(for both genetic and environmental reasons), significant association found by this
test does not necessarily imply pleiotropy.
Lack of significant association on the basis
of such a test, however, does imply that if
the activity measure is partially determined
by a locus linked to the marker locus, then
there is no significant linkage disequilibrium between the two loci.

Using the method given by Haseman
and Elston (1972), linkage was detected
by regressing the squared twin difference,
for a given activity measure, on the estimated proportion of genes identical by
descent that the twin pair shares at a
given locus. A significant negative regression, in the absence of association between
the activity measure and the marker
phenotypes, is indicative of linkage. Since
squared differences cannot possibly be
normally distributed, the usual parametric
t-statistics for testing regression will in
this case approximate Student’s ¢-distribution (under the null hypothesis of no
regression) in very large samples only;
therefore the rank correlation, and the corresponding f-statistic (¢—=r[(n— 2)/

 

Social Biology

(1 — r*)]?/*), has also been calculated.
Furthermore, in an attempt to avoid spuriously significant results due to an inappropriate scale of measurement, the
calculations were performed both on the
raw activities scores and on their logarithms. In order to estimate the proportion
of genes identical by descent shared by
a twin pair, the gene frequencies for the
marker system are needed; the calculations were performed using both the estimated gene frequencies in Table 2 and,
in a separate set of computer runs, the
gene frequencies reported by Race and
Sanger (1968) for Caucasian populations.

RESULTS

BLOOD GROUP AND BEHAVIORALMORPHOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES

As Table 3 indicates, substantial correlations were found between the number of
blood group differences and differences in
the appearance of the cotwins. A correlation
of 0.51 was obtained between the experimenters’ ratings of physical dissimilarity
and the absolute number of definite blood
group allele differences.

Since mothers’ ratings were a binary distribution of MZ and DZ responses, their
guesses were treated in a chi-square distribution, divided between less-than-four
and four-or-more blood group differences.
Of the 14 pairs with fewer than four blood
system differences, five were rated as MZ
and nine as DZ. Of the 12 pairs with four
or more differences, only two were guessed
to be MZ while 10 were judged to be DZ.
This resulted in a chi-square value of
6.31, significant at less than the 0.05 level.

Ratings of behavioral dissimilarity by
both the mother and the combined experimenters were positively but not significantly correlated with blood group differences between the DZ cotwins. The larger
the number of blood group differences, the

more dissimilar their activity levels and
general behavior were judged to be.

Seven of the eight behavioral measures
of differences in reaction times and preferences for activity level correlated positively with blood group differences. Two
of the eight measures of activity were
significant at or beyond the 0.05 level.

Birth weight differences between the
DZ cotwins were included in the correlational analysis to examine intrauterine influences on cotwin differences. Birth weight
differences were found to correlate with
blood group differences in a negative direction (r = —.28), while behavioral and
blood group differences were positively
correlated. Thus, birth weight differences
were not seen as a major contaminant of
the relationship between genetic and behavioral similarity among DZ twins. It is
worthy of note, however, that such a negative relation between birth weight and
blood group differences would seem to find
an interesting parallel in a recent study
(Kaelber and Pugh, 1969) in which it was
found that large birth weight differences
between twin partners are accompanied by

significant IQ differences in monozygotic
pairs, but not in dizygotic pairs.

GENETIC LINKAGE ANALYSES

Of the ninety tests of association performed (10 activity measures times 9
marker systems), nine were significant at
the 5% level, and of these one was significant at the 1% level. These are indicated by daggers in Table 4, but, for
the reasons stated above, no implication
should be drawn from these particular
associations other than that they can be
the cause of significant results in the linkage tests. (The very significant association
between Rh and Toys total time is due
to one observation, the only one in its
particular phenotypic class).

The results of the tests for linkage differed little whether the estimated or the
previously reported gene frequencies were
used. We therefore report here only the
results for the estimated frequencies,
which, in view of the fact that they show
no evidence of deviating greatly from
normal Caucasian populations, are probably more appropriate.

The general effect of taking logarithms
of the raw data was a tendency to decrease the significance of the linkage test
results. This effect, however, was important
only for those activity measures whose
distribution is positively skewed. A choice
was made as follows, for each activity
measure, to determine whether to report
the detailed results from the calculations
on the raw measures or on their logarithms. An empirical cumulative plot of
the 52 data points was compared visually
with the best-fitting cumulative normal
and log normal distributions. In addition,
measures of skewness and kurtosis were
calculated for each distribution. In the
case of four of the measures the log normal
distribution clearly fitted the data much
better, and so for these activity measures

the detailed results after a logarithmic
transformation are reported; in the other
sIX cases a normal distribution fitted better and the detailed results using the raw
data are reported.

The detailed results are given in Table
4 in the form of ¢-statistics. For each of
the 90 possible linkage relationships two
t-statistics, with 24 degrees of freedom,
are given: the usual one for a parametric
test of unweighted linear regression, the
é-statistic derived from the nonparametric
rank correlation, Out of these 180 statistics, 110 (61.1%) are negative; 14
(7.8%) are significantly negative at the
5% level, and 3 (1.7%) are further significantly negative at the 1% level. It
is thus clear there is an overall tendency
for the regressions to be negative, implying

Vol. 19, No. 2

a definite genetic involvement in the variation of the ten activity measures. Since the
percentages of significant tests were only
slightly higher than that expected due to
chance (7.8% vs. 5% and 1.7% vs. 1%),
these results can at best be only weak
indications of particular linkages.

The most significant results in Table 4
indicate that the best evidence is for the
three linkages

Toys activity level ....... MNSs
TAT time range ........ Hp

and that some possibility exists for any
of the linkages

Patience nssecisausasees Se
Frequency of activity .... P, Le, Jk.
Slides time range ........ Rh

The only important differences between
the results in Table 4 and what might be
inferred from all of the calculations performed concern certain significant results
that might be missed. If the raw measures,
and not the logarithms, are analyzed, the
following are further found to be significant at the 5% level:

TAT time range ....... Rh, P
TAT total time ........ Le
Toys time range ....... Se
Toys total time ........ ABO.

However, none of these receive convincing
support from the results in Table 4.
Again, it should be emphasized that the
linkages reported above can only be considered as tentative possibilities to be examined more closely in future investigations. Although one or two of them may
in fact be real, much larger samples are
necessary before any firm statements can
be made as to which of the significant re

sults reflect real phenomena and which
merely reflect “Type 1 error.”

DISCUSSION

The first hypothesis, that blood group
differences can be used as indices of
genetic dissimilarity which would be found
to be related to physical and behavioral
differences, is confirmed for measures of
physical appearance and activity level.
The usefulness of blood groups as markers
of genotypic differences in the quantitative study of sibling variability is supported. The ability to estimate the degree
of genetic similarity between sibs could
have important implications for the study
of genetic and environmental influences
within families,

The second hypothesis, that genetic
linkages can be found between marker
genes and major genes controlling behavioral characteristics also finds support. A
negative regression is to be expected if one
or more genes, determining variability in
the quantitative measure, are genetically linked to the marker. There are also
other ways in which a negative regression
could conceivably occur (involving epistasis, and possibly environmental interactions), but linkage would appear to be
the simplest explanation. In any case, if
the regression in the population (as opposed
to the sample) is truly negative, then the
marker locus, which is known to be genetically determined, is necessarily involved
(see Bock et al., 1970). Had the sample
size been larger, it would have been feasible
to analyze the data further, in the manner
suggested by Haseman and Elston (1972),
in an attempt to pinpoint major genes
affecting the activity measures. There is
also the possibility that a multivariate extension of the methods used in this paper,
somewhat analogous to the approach used
by Bock et al. (1970), would help define
any linkages present.

This study supports the usefulness of
blood groups as markers in the quantitative study of sibling pairs. Furthermore it
shows that the use of same sex dizygotic
twins, in which the effects of developmental
(age) and environmental effects are
minimized, can be extremely useful in
elucidating genetic influences within families. It is often assumed in behavioral
studies that within-family similarities
among children are entirely of postnatal
environmental origin. Social psychological
research has emphasized the importance of
identification with parents, role learning,
and socialization practices on the development of child behavior. Similarities between
sibs are usually ascribed to these processes
regardless of the genetic similarity or dissimilarity of children within the same
family. Only in the case of MZ twins are
most psychologists prepared to consider
the role of genotype in determining similarity of behavior within a sibship.

If blood group factors were used to
investigate genetic linkages in DZ twins
and sibs, including opposite sex pairs, then
the effects of environmental contingencies
on their behavioral similarities and differences could be better understood. This
paper has attempted to demonstrate the
feasibility of such an approach.
