A Conceptual Model for the Identification,
Organization, and Measure of Influence
of Fertility Policies and Programs

ABSTRACT: The conceptual model presented allows for the identification and organization of
different kinds of fertility policies and programs, as they affect fertility, and the relevant elements
of the sociocultural variables, dichotomized into “structural” and “cultural” components, that can
be associated with fertility. Support for the model was obtained by “fitting” Puerto Rican fertility
policies and programs, and structural and cultural components, to the model. Seventeen regression equations using polynomials to the third degree are used for the statistical interpretation of
the Puerto Rican data. The results indicate that the use and interpretation of the model and some
of the polynomial regression analyses are successful.

The important question “What are the
factors affecting fertility?” has been tackled by researchers a number of times. But,
oddly enough, a view of fertility change
from a policy perspective that reflects
sociocultural components of fertility has
rarely been attempted. As a result, and
also because of insufficient sociological research, two problems arise.

One is a lack of knowledge concerning
the effect that different kinds of fertility
policies and programs have on fertility.
The second is that little has been done to
determine the sociocultural factors amenable to government intervention through
which change in fertility can occur. The
importance of identifying such variables
becomes clearer when one considers that
governments have long been enacting fertility programs without adequate benefit
of a sociological perspective.

These two problems have prompted the
author to develop a conceptual model that
can identify different kinds of fertility
policies and programs as they affect fertility and also identifies the relevant ele
ments of the sociocultural variables that
can be associated with fertility. The relationship identified is such that sociocultural variables act as intervening variables
between fertility policies and programs
and a change in fertility.

The model that is briefly presented
seems relatively comprehensive and suited
to empirical analysis. It can be used to
uncover the effect fertility policies and
programs have on fertility.

If the structural and cultural elements of
the model can be identified in a country,
and a change in them can be attributed to
specific fertility policies and programs,
then such a change can be identified and
measured. This is the general proposition
that represents this exploratory study’s
methodological approach.

A test of the model can be accomplished
by “fitting” a country to the model. This
involves three steps. First, the relevant
literature is reviewed and fertility policies
and programs and sociocultural elements
are identified. An interpretation is then
made of the influence of fertility policies

and programs on the sociocultural variables, and the sociocultural variables on
fertility. The mumber and types of
sociocultural variables used may differ,
depending upon the country.

The second step involves the statistical
analysis. Because the interest in these data
lies in their trend over a specified period of
time, a type of trend analysis using
polynomial regression is used to “test” the
trend of birth or fertility rates.

The third step integrates the conclusions
of an extensive literature review and the
Statistical analysis.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE MODEL

FERTILITY POLICIES AND PROGRAMS

Fertility is being increasingly identified
as one of the most important problematic
factors in population growth. Drawing
from discussions on population policy by
Eldridge (1968, p. 381; 1954, p. 5),
Lorimer (1969), Nortman (1964), National
Academy of Sciences (1971), and Taylor
(1968), we may define a fertility policy as
the method or course of action that has
been adopted by a government and is designed to influence and to determine decisions regarding the fertility of a country.
There are two kinds of fertility policies,
explicit and implicit.

An explicit fertility policy is one that is
expressed by the government as a fertility
policy. An explicit fertility policy is either
“restrictive,” i.e., designed to provide
principles for limiting further growth or
change (Spengler and Duncan, 1956, p.
441) or “expansionist,” i.e., advocating an
increase in population or the rate of
growth (Cook, 1951; Glass, 1936; and
Wright, 1939).

The procedural action of the fertility
policy is the fertility program. It is an organized list of procedures—a schedule arranged to produce an intended observable
effect following the principles set forth by

Conceptual Model

327

the fertility policy (Eldridge, 1954; Kirk,
1970, p. 87). Fertility programs are either
“responsive” to population change, i.e.,
“they are enacted to ameliorate or overcome the effects of rapid population
growth” (American Universities Field
Staff, 1972, p. 289) (emphasis mine), or
they are “influencing” population change
(American Universities Field Staff, 1972,
p. 289; National Academy of Sciences,
1971, pp. 70-72, 77-95), i.e., pro-natalist
or anti-natalist (Thomlinson, 1965; Peterson, 1969). While fertility programs are
enacted under guidance of a policy
perspective and are designed with “intended” structural and cultural effects,
they may, in fact, have “unintended” effects.

At the same level as explicit fertility
policies are implicit policies. Implicit fertility policies do not reflect the avowed
purposes of the government and are not
expressed as fertility policies.

The last variable, time, is perhaps the
one important variable which can be used
to measure change in fertility. Time is divided into “short-term” and “long-term”
effects (Spengler, 1955). This distinction is
important because the greater the period
of time, the greater the possibility that
other fertility and nonfertility programs
will intervene and confound the effects of
the fertility programs being studied.

SOCIOCULTURAL VARIABLES:
STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS

Structural components refer to the
characteristics of patterned social order
(Olsen, 1968, pp. 44-50). The first three
structural factors are discussed in depth by
Davis and Blake (1956). They include factors affecting exposure to intercourse, exposure to conception, and gestation and
successful parturition. An up-date and
general expansion to include more fully
the industrialized countries can be found
in Davis (1967), Deyrup (1962), GoldDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

328 Pendleton

scheider (1971), Hartley (1972), Pendleton
(1974a), and Thomlinson (1965).

The fourth variable affecting fertility is
the social organization of the society; the
coordination of social relationships among
individuals and groups. The patterned
regularities of behavior that represent
stable organization promote conformity to
traditional practices which may be supporting a high or low fertility rate. Degrees
of disorganization, usually stimulated by
very rapid social change, may affect fertility by reducing conformity to traditional
fertility behavior or by contributing to the
spread of sterility-inducing diseases, pestilence, famine, and sacrifice (Freedman,
1961, pp. 64, 66; Lorimer, 1969, pp. 248,
251; Peterson, 1969, pp. 391-392).

The fifth variable is education and socialization. Education involves the systematic transfer of skills or specific knowledge (Davis, 1949, pp. 218-220). In reference to fertility, education can be divided
into two types of influence (Nam, 1968, p.
515). The first is education’s influence on
the standard and style of living. Most
prominent here is the inverse relationship
between education (or social class) and
fertility (American Universities Field
Staff, 1972, p. 20; Banks, 1968, p. 515;
Beshers, 1967, pp. 499-500; Bogue, 1969,
pp. 676-677; Liu, 1970, pp. 473-484; National Academy of Sciences, 1971, pp.
53-54; Peterson, 1969, pp. 117, 501-503;
and Thomlinson, 1965, pp. 180-183). The
second influence of education involves the
dissemination of available contraceptive
knowledge. Education provides the individual with knowledge needed to regulate
fertility behavior (Nam, 1968, p. 515; also
see the Commission on Population Growth
and the American Future, 1972, pp. 123124).

The sixth and last variable, health and
welfare, is divided into physical health,
mental health, and welfare. An increase in
physical health for any country can “in
Social Biology

crease fertility rates, partly by permitting
more people to survive to the reproductive
ages and partly by reducing diseases and
physical disabilities that cause sterility”
(Ford and DeJong, 1970, p. 400; also see
Corsa and Oakley, 1971; Hartley, 1972,
pp. 214-215; National Academy of Sciences, 1971, p. 3; and Peterson, 1969, p.
230). The influence of mental health on
fertility deals with a greater sense of group
belongingness, fulfillment of various
psychic rewards, and greater employment
opportunities (for women) resulting in
women wanting smaller families (Population Reference Bureau, 1970, p. 26). The
impact of welfare on fertility is very unclear. Inducements (e.g., monetary rewards) to limit or increase fertility have
been used, but the actual effect seems to
be minimal or linked to other variables in
a complex fashion (Carr-Saunders, 1968,
pp. 143-153; Ford and DeJong, 1970, pp.
400, 402; Pendleton, 19740; Schorr, 1970,
pp. 441-453).

SOCIOCULTURAL VARIABLES:
CULTURAL COMPONENTS

Cultural factors consist of “all shared
beliefs and knowledge, the norms or expectations” of behavior “and the values or
ideas of what is most desirable, as well as
the evaluations of actual behavior in light
of the shared beliefs, expectations and
values” (Hartley, 1972, p. 198). Three
components of culture are distinguished
for the purposes of this paper: knowledge
and beliefs, values, and norms and mores.

The knowledge and beliefs of a society
are similar and tend to be distinguished as
a matter of degree. Beliefs are a matter of
faith and emotion as opposed to the scientific “truth” or “reality” of knowledge, but
both are regarded as real and true. Beliefs
or knowledge about male virility, biblical
requirements for progeny (Davis, 1949,
pp. 561-562), being a “complete” woman
(Thomlinson, 1965, pp. 155-156), con

ception, contraception, or the advantages
of raising small or large families (Bogue,
1969, p. 678; Hartley, 1972, pp. 46-48) all
serve to influence fertility.

Values are often regarded as cherished
ideas or ideals. They carry with them the
emotionally charged feeling of right and
wrong and tend to determine what is considered desirable, worthwhile, and important; they can also explain and justify behavior. Values, as they are related to fertility, can be tangible, i.e., monetary and
nonmonetary (Meadows, 1956, p. 441;
Hartley, 1972, p. 257), or intangible. Intangible values include immaterial assets
(Hartley, 1972, p. 257), spiritual inducements to enter marriage and produce children (Thomlinson, 1965, p. 560), perpetuation of the family lines (Lorimer,
1969, p. 247), sex preference of offspring
(Population Reference Bureau, 1970, p.
25), and the development of attitudes toward pregnancy and parenthood (Davis,
1967, p. 737; Lorimer, 1969, pp. 249-250).

The third cultural component includes
norms and mores. Norms define the
legitimate objectives worth striving for
(Merton, 1949, p. 126), while mores are
obligatory norms supported by core values
of the culture. In a demographic sense,
social norms and mores are those dealing
primarily with reproductive processes, or
those regarded as “normal” in relation to
marriage and reproduction. Examples include the interpersonal communication
involved in family planning decisions
(Freedman, 1961; Stycos, 1968a, p. 438)
and sanctions employed to promote certain kinds of fertility behavior (Davis,
1949, pp. 557-561; 1963, pp. 362-365).

APPLICATION OF THE MODEL: THE
CASE OF PUERTO RICO

The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico was
chosen as an empirical example to fit the
model because of three factors: (a) as a

Conceptual Model

 

329

Commonwealth of the United States since
1952, and before that a Territory, it is
assumed that special attention was given
to the collection and reporting of demographic data; (b) “no soundings of public
or private opinion prior to the 1960’s with
respect to family planning were taken in
Latin America, other than in Puerto Rico”
(Stycos, 1971, p. 76); and (c) a preliminary
review of the literature showed a fairly
large body of social demographic information available for Puerto Rico.

FERTILITY POLICIES AND PROGRAMS

Puerto Rico made what are possibly the
earliest attempts of fertility control among
Latin American nations (Nortman, 1964,
p. 18). Since the early 1930’s, Puerto Rico
has officially had a policy of “restriction”
with respect to population growth. While
this policy has been somewhat overshadowed by religious pressure and World
War II, it has manifested itself with both
fertility programs and a slow but constant
change of attitude toward acceptance of
birth control by the population.

For Puerto Rico, programs reported
most often and in the greatest detail are
the family planning programs. These programs, since 1940, are listed below in
chronological order.

In 1946, a voluntary organization called
the Association of Population Studies was
formed for the purposes of contraceptive
education and dissemination, research,
and financial aid for sterilization and fertility services (Curt, 1966, p. 230). Funding for the Association initially came from
the Planned Parenthood Association of
America. Soon afterwards, other private
sources began granting money to the Association because funds could not be obtained from the Puerto Rican government
(Back et al., 1960, p. 565; United Nations,
1972, pp. 69-70).

In 1959 the name was changed to the
Family Planning Association. This new

330 Pendleton 
Association “started a unique campaign of
utilizing lay voluntary leaders to distribute
a vaginal contraceptive cream on an
island-wide basis” (Curt, 1966, p. 231).
But because of the lack of funding, the
programs supported by the Family Planning Association had all but disappeared
by 1965 (Kelly, 1972, pp. 49-50).

Then, in mid-1964, the University of
Puerto Rico’s Medical School began a program for an area that included San Juan,
Puerto Rico’s largest city. The program
was most active between 1964 and 1968
(Torres, 1969, p. 115).

In 1966, the United States Office of
Economic Opportunity gave a sizable
grant to the almost defunct Family Planning Association of Puerto Rico (Torres,
1969, pp. 121-122; Kelly, 1972, p. 50).

Since 1967, the Puerto Rican government has reportedly taken steps to support
more actively the organizations already in
existence and to support research and educational activities directed toward fertility
control (Torres, 1969, pp. 118-121).

SOCIOCULTURAL VARIABLES

A general survey of the relevant literature on Puerto Rico produced sociocultural information that was classified according to the listing of the sociocultural
variables presented earlier (Pendleton,
1974a). The eight variables discussed
below were determined as influencing fertility.

Age at first marriage is extremely low.
During the early 1950’s, about 50 per cent
of women were married by the time they
were 16 years of age, and by age 21, nearly
90 per cent of women were married. Information from the United Nations (summarized by Pendleton, 1974a) indicates
that there was also a fairly low age of entry
into a consensual union and that this low
age of entry continued into the late 1960's.

Theoretically, a low age of entry into a
sexual union does not necessarily mean a

Social Biology

low age for first birth. However, the
United Nation’s data for Puerto Rico show
that between 1949 and 1966, 70 to 80 per
cent of all first births occurred to women
under 24 years of age (Pendleton, 1974a,
p. 73). Women under the age of 19 alone
accounted for 40 per cent of the total first
births. Thus, there has been a consistently
low age both for entry into a sexual union
and for first birth.

Puerto Rico was small enough for mass
emigration! to act as an effective safety valve in halting what would have
been extremely rapid population growth
(Thomlinson, 1965, p. 342). Occurring between 1946 and 1959, the mass emigration
largely involved the age group 15-44 years
old (Friedlander, 1965). What effect emigration had on lowering fertility is discussed later.

On the surface, figures for sterilization
(voluntary infecundity) are impressive.
Approximately 17 per cent of the female
population was sterilized in the early
1950’s (Back et al., 1960, p. 572), and by
1965 this figure had increased to about 34
per cent (United Nations, 1972, p. 100).
But the majority of the women were
sterilized after their fourth pregnancy, and
because of the popularity of the operation,
many women were motivated to have
their children earlier (Hill et al., 1969, pp.
176-177; Hatt, 1952, p. 447). The latter
influence would tend to support an increase in fertility. .

Before the introduction of the “pill” and
the IUD, birth control use was irregular
and probably had little influence. The
IUD, and the pill as well, seemed to have
the “once and for all” appeal that made
sterilization so popular. The effect of the
contemporary methods is unclear, although by 1965 50 per cent of the females

job and to establish a financial base before sending
for the remaining spouse.

of reproductive age were estimated to be
using birth control, of which 28 per cent
were using the pill or [UD (Vazquez, 1968;
Satterthwaite, 1966).

Overt religious disapproval of birth control did little to halt its use. What effect
the anti-birth-control campaign had was
reflected in the government, which ended
up adopting a fairly neutral public position in the birth control debate (Back et
al., 1969, p. 568). Church denunciation
did have some apparent pro—birth-control
impact. The publicity intended to be
against contraception actually served to
disseminate information about contraceptives all over the island, which actually
may have served to promote their use (See
Stycos, 19685, pp. 98-115).

A lack of communication between
spouses has served to impede the progress
of birth control use (Stycos, 1962, pp.
311-312; Hill et al., 1959, pp. 147-162).
Without communication between partners
in the area of sex and birth control, the
success of a birth control program diminishes (Stycos, 1968), pp. 140-141).

Education has served as a_ building
block for furthering the spread of birth
control knowledge and decreasing the
traditional attitude of viewing children as
economic benefits. The more educated,
especially the rural educated, used birth
control more often and knew where to go
for contraceptive services and information
(Back et al., 1960).

Health conditions have improved correspondingly with a decrease in infant and
maternal mortality rates. The result is not
only longer life expectancy but an increase
in potential reproduction (Curt, 1966, p.
229, Vazquez, 1968, p. 862).

While knowledge of birth control is very
high, many women do not obtain this
knowledge until after their third child.
The remaining women also run into problems with irregular use of birth control
and lack of communication with their

331

spouses (Hill et al., 1959; Back et al.,
1960).

METHODOLOGY

Trend analysis using polynomial regression is used for the data analysis covering several periods of time. The crude
birth rate and fertility rate are used as
dependent variables representing “fertility.” Emigration is included because of its
reported importance in affecting Puerto
Rico’s fertility.

Polynomial regression uses regression
equations of varying degrees to fit the data
(Draper and Smith, 1966; Winer, 1962,
pp. 70-71, 218-220). If the trend of the
data is a straight line, a linear equation is
used to provide the best explanation. A
second degree (quadratic) equation, or
that which determines the data as having
either a change from an upward to downward movement or the reverse, may provide a better explanation than the linear
trend. A third degree equation, using the
cube of the predictor variable found in the
linear and second degree equations, may
provide still another, possibly better, explanation for the trend of the data. The
third degree equation describes two
changes in the direction of the data
(Cooley and Lohnes, 1971, pp. 76-95;
Kelly and Beggs, 1969; Ward and Jennings, 1973; Williams, 1974, pp. 124-143).

The format of the analysis of variance
table which is used for each set of regression equations is presented in Cooley and
Lohnes (1971, p. 80). The sum of squares
is represented as the multiple correlation
squared (R?), indicating the overall effectiveness of the multiple regression.

An initial F value is calculated for all

2 The impact of Puerto Rico’s socioeconomic development is unclear. Socioeconomic development,
as a generic term, may be represented by the empirical indicators of education and health conditions.
However, while other socioeconomic indicators may
be important, we remain with the socially oriented
variables in this study.

332

three equations for the reduction due to
the model. This F value is used as the
decision rule for determining if there is
deviation from the expected linear, second, or third degree trend. If the F value is
significant, the fertility or birth rate does
not deviate from the trend defined by each
equation. Such lack of deviation means
that there is a “curve of smoothness” for
fertility variation, and there are probably
no changes in the fertility or birth rate that
can be associated with fertility policies or
programs. If the F value for the reduction
due to the model is not significant, it indicates that there are sharp variations in the
fertility or birth rate that may be associated with fertility policies or programs.

A second F value is calculated for the
reduction (of the residual) due to the addition of either the quadratic or cubic trend.
This F value indicates if the addition of
the quadratic equation significantly increases the amount of variance explained
beyond that for the linear trend, and if the
addition of the cubic equation significantly
increases the amount of variance explained beyond that for the quadratic
trend.

The first set of regression equations uses
the fertility rate as the criterion variable
and allows emigration to be partialed out.
The greatest length of time for which there
are data available for both variables, 1947
to 1962, is used. The greatest amount of
out-migration occurred between 1951 and
1959, which is effectively covered by this
time span.

A second set of equations uses the crude
birth rate between 1940 and 1962 as the
criterion variable. The need to use the
crude birth rate is dictated by the lack of
data before 1947 to calculate fertility rates.
It is now possible to identify any pattern
taking place in emigration and the crude
birth rate before the greater fluctuations in
emigration.

A third set contains the data that will

Pendleton

Social Biology

cover the entire period from 1947 to 1970,
the time period when most of the more
recent attempts to change fertility were
being made. Knowing the effects of emigration on fertility from the first two sets
of equations, we can then identify the significant variation in fertility from set
three. The fertility rate, and not the crude
birth rate, is used as the criterion variable
because of its greater accuracy in representing fertility.

RESULTS

The first set of regression equations,
covering the years 1947 to 1962, attempts
to identify the influence of Puerto Rico’s
out-migration on fertility. We are now
able to “test” the opinion of some authors
that emigration was a primary reason for
the decline in Puerto Rico’s fertility rate.
Our measure of fertility excludes the very
young and very old, but includes males
ages 15 to 44 who, because of possible sex
selection in emigration, could contribute
to fertility changes.

The important figure is the 1.9 per cent
variance accounted for by emigration after
the linear trend. This interpretation of the
effect of emigration on fertility is in conflict with the explanations given by Friedlander (1965), and Hill et al., (1959, pp.
14-15) and implied by Thomlinson (1965,
p. 494).

emigration in each trend. The variance
accounted for by each trend, after emigration is partialed out, can then be used for
the analysis of variance table for the first
set of equations.

In Table 3, the overall F values for the
trends are found to be significant. But, the

Conceptual Model

333

quadratic equation does not significantly
add to the amount of variance explained
by the linear equation, nor does the cubic
equation significantly add to the quadratic
equation. This finding means that the
linear trend, with an F value of 41.62, is
highly significant. However, the actual
data still deviate somewhat from the expected values as shown by the R? residual
from linear fit (0.238). In other words,
almost 24 per cent of the variance in the
fertility rate is unaccounted for, which
indicates that the variations may be associated with the activities of the family
planning organizations and birth control
clinics. We now examine this possibility
more closely.

The largest emigration from Puerto
Rico occurred between 1950 and 1954, although there were smaller blocks of outmigration between 1945 and 1947, and

people left between 1950 and 1957.

The effect of the 1950 to 1954 movement is reflected in a fertility-rate drop
between 1950 and 1954. But the increase
in emigration between 1954 and 1957 was
not mirrored by a decrease in the fertility

rate between 1954 and 1957. For the most
part, the fertility rate increased during
those years.

On the whole, emigration began to increase sharply after 1949, nearly two years
after the birth rate began to drop sharply.
The fertility rate also seems to have
dropped sharply after 1947. However,
since the trend of the fertility rate before 1947 is unknown, it is difficult to
determine if it had been dropping for a
number of years or if it was indeed a sharp
decrease.

For the years 1943 to 1947, when emigration began building, there is a corresponding increase in the birth rate. Later,
between 1956 and 1962, when emigration
declined sharply, there is not the reverse
effect on either the fertility rate or the
birth rate. On the contrary, they continue
decreasing.

The only time emigration may have affected fertility, at least in the short run,
was between 1950 and 1954. But the effect
is probably minimal, given the already decreasing fertility and birth rates. And, as
indicated statistically for the entire 23-year
period, no more than 1.9 per cent of the
variance in the fertility rate and 3.1 per
cent in the birth rate is accounted for by
emigration when the linear models are
used.

The second set of equations used the
birth rate as the criterion variable and
covers the years 1940 to 1962, taking into
account all of the years in which detailed
emigration data are available. This set is
used specifically to support the interpretations made earlier, especially those dealing
with the contribution of emigration to
changes in fertility. It also takes into account the first years when emigration
began to increase quickly.

Table 4 shows the unique contribution
made by emigration for each trend between 1940 and 1962. Emigration accounts for 3.1 per cent of the total variance

This figure compares to 1.9 per cent accounted for in the fertility rate for the
years 1947 to 1962 (Table 1). After the
quadratic fit, emigration accounts for 1.4
per cent of the total variance compared to
0.5 for the fertility rate. Emigration accounts for none of the variance after the
cubic fit. This finding is the same as that
for the fertility rate.

emigration for each of the three trends.

the R? of 0.920 explains a significantly
greater proportion of the variance than
does the quadratic R? of 0.860 and that the
data have two changes in them between
1940 and 1962. There is little deviation
from the cubic trend as indicated by the
significant F value of 72.8 and the R? for
the residual from the cubic fit (0.08),
which support and clarify the findings of
the first set. So, the effect of emigration on
fertility can be regarded as minimal in in
fluence and dropped from further analySIS.

Without having to consider the influence of emigration, the third set of equations can now be used to determine the
variations in fertility between 1947 and
1970. The analysis of variance table for
this set is presented in Table 7.

equations to the amount of variance explained is not significant. Following the
rule of parsimony, the linear equation is
most important. The significant F of 19.8
indicates that the monotonic equation best
explains the trend of the birth rate. But
notice that only 47.4 per cent of the variance in the birth rate is accounted for.
This figure is the lowest R* encountered
yet. Almost 53 per cent of the variance is
unaccounted for, strongly indicating that
any sharp variations in the fertility rate
may be due to the influence of fertility
programs.

After 1947 both the birth and fertility
rates begin very sharp declines. The fertility rate drops sharply between 1947 and
1954 with the exception of 1949 to 1950.
This sharp decrease begins about a year
after the Association of Population Studies
began its operations. The birth rate increases slightly between 1943 and 1947,
due to the ending of World War II and the
returning servicemen.

There was an extremely low age of entry
into a sexual union and age at first birth.
The reported popularity of sterilization
may have acted as an important variable
with the low age of entry and first birth. If
looking ahead to sterilization did motivate
women to complete their families at an
earlier age, this motivation may be reflected by the early ages at first birth.
Lack of communication between partners
and the increasing health of the population
would serve to promote an increase in fertility rather than the observed decrease. A
knowledge of birth control, and that it
could be used to limit unwanted births in
the future, would also be a slight stimulant
for fertility.

Operating against those factors promoting an increase in fertility were increasing
education, the unwitting advertising of
birth control by the church, and the use of
contraceptives. Many Puerto Ricans had
already heard of contraceptives (since the

Pendleton

Social Biology

late 1930’s), and the illiterate population
had been rapidly decreasing. There was
also an increased availability of contraceptives, presumably encouraging
greater use. Although the Association of
Population Studies may have been the
primary agent for the fantastic decrease in
fertility, there is a great probability that
the fertility rate would have decreased
anyway. The stage was set, or had been in
the making, for a number of years before
1947. The Association simply acted as a
“trigger” for the decrease.

Between 1954 and 1956, the fertility
rate rose sharply. It is possible that the
drastic reduction in emigration between
1953 and 1954 could explain some proportion of the increase. It also may be part of
the “baby boom.” Adding to this increase
would be the decreasing influence of the
Association of Population Studies, which
by the middle 1950’s had begun to stagnate. The fertility rate then decreased between 1956 and 1960 which may have
been a continuation of the decline given
impetus in the late 1940’s and early 1950’s.

The fertility rate declined very quickly
after 1960, from 80 to 59. In 1959, the
Association of Population Studies was
given new life through sizable monetary
grants and new organization. Then called
the Family Planning Association of Puerto
Rico, it started campaigns that apparently
were more effective than those before. The
majority of the fertility rate decline between 1960 and 1963 must be attributed to
the Family Planning Association of Puerto
Rico. After about 1962, the Association
began to become ineffective. A slowing of
the fertility rate decline between 1963 and
1965 reflects this. The age of first entry
into a sexual union and first birth were
still low in the 1960’s, and sterilization had
risen to 34 per cent by 1965. But, the
introduction of the pill, and the dissatisfaction of the church, unintendingly
popularizing birth control, served to pro

Vol. 23, No. 4

vide the influence needed to further lower
the fertility rate. With the increased level
of education, the lack of communication
between spouses and late accumulation of
birth control knowledge may have decreased in importance as stimulants for
fertility. The new program begun by the
University of Puerto Rico’s Medical
School (in 1964) in the Commonwealth’s
most populated area, the northeast region,
seemed to revive a decrease in the fertility
rate after 1965. The Family Planning Association of Puerto Rico was given sizable
amounts of money in 1966. The effect,
along with the university’s program, was
to continue the rate of decrease at a
slightly faster pace than before.

Generally, the Association of Population Studies, the earliest organization, had
the most questionable impact upon fertility. But when included with the other
three programs over the 24 years, the total
effect of all four programs appears to be
quite important in explaining the fertility
rate decreases.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

With the first two sets of regression
equations, we find that the effects of emigration between 1940 and 1962 are minimal. The computed percentages of the
total variance accounted for by emigration
was found to be quite small; and, after the
effect of emigration was partialed out of
both the fertility and birth rate, there were
still significant variations from the expected trends.

There are a number of possible explanations for the lack of influence by emigration. First, a majority of the emigrants
may have been past their reproductive
ages or males aged 15-44. The effect on
Puerto Rican fertility would be minimal if
the males who left did not significantly
reduce the number of males who could be
regarded as eligible mates. This explana
Conceptual Model

337

tion may by supported by Vazquez (1968,
p. 858) who reports that in 1950 the proportion of women 15 to 44 years of age to
the total female population was 43 per
cent. This percentage declined to 40 per
cent in 1960 due to the age selectivity of
emigration. By 1967, this percentage was
up to 43 per cent again. This 3 per cent
variation does not seem to be enough to
affect fertility.

A second explanation is that emigration
did significantly affect fertility, but the effect was not to reduce fertility but rather
to keep it from increasing. If, after 1947,
the Puerto Rican fertility rate was destined
to increase, then emigration may have
played an important role in containing
that increase.

The third explanation for a lack of influence by emigration is given by Stycos
(1968b) when he says that “women migrants have consistently lower fertility
than non-migrants, even when residence,
age, marital status, education and employment status are controlled” (p. 282).

The third set of regression equations
were used for the years 1947 to 1970,
without regard to emigration. This analysis showed that there were very significant variations from both the linear and
quadratic trends. The first program, in
1946, contributed to a sharp decline in
both the fertility rate and the birth rate. It
acted as a “trigger,” but was not the underlying cause of the fertility decrease
after 1947. The other three programs,
begun in 1959, 1964, and 1966, served to
lower the fertility faster than before. Their
effect is not as unclear as that of the 1946
program.

The interpretation of which structural
and cultural components played a more
important role is difficult. The low age at
first entry into a sexual union and first
birth is the one confounding factor. Both
ages have remained extremely low since
1949, definitely providing a stimulus for
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

338

fertility rates. It is possible, however, that
this factor is a prime agent in keeping the
fertility rate as high as it is.

The lack of longitudinal information
about other factors made it difficult to expand their influence beyond an ordinal
“canceling out” procedure. However, the
influence of the 1959, 1964, and 1966 programs seems to be clearly one of promoting decreases in the fertility rate.

LIMITATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Assessing the impact of fertility policies
and programs is not a new endeavor.
Previous attempts, such as that of Spengler (1938) or more recently of the National
Academy of Sciences (1971), have consisted primarily of case studies. While the
more recent works have used sophisticated
statistical techniques, the data used have
remained poor. Detailed data for individual countries over a long period of time
have never been collected. An assessment
of the impact of governmental action related to fertility almost invariably needs
data over an extended period of time.

An area which especially needed extensive work involved the formation of a conceptual model through which the effect of
governmental action on fertility could be
better recognized and understood. Work
by Sauvy (1969), Davis and Blake (1956),
and Spengler (1955) served as the primary
framework from which the present model
was developed.

The selection of a country to “fit” the
model was necessary to show that the conceptual model could be used to identify
relevant factors affecting fertility. Here
again, there was some shortage of data.
Knowledge, attitude, and practice surveys
are numerous in the literature but are
often limited to a single point in time. The
variables for which a longitudinal perspective can be obtained are few, and they
are often questionable.

The statistical procedure used to analyze the Puerto Rican data was con
Pendleton

Social Biology

founded by the lack of some data and the
need to estimate others. A statistical procedure can be highly sophisticated, but
when the data are crude or questionable,
the results and interpretation are bound to
suffer (see Gregory et al., 1972). The same
is true when estimating data. Regression
coefficients were used to estimate fertility
rates for two years. While the very procedure of estimation carries with .it some
degree of error, it is increased when the
data from which the estimates are made
are themselves estimates. With the exception of the census years, the fertility rates
were calculated from age-specific population figures estimated by the United Nations.

The results obtained seem to indicate,
on the whole, that the model is fairly successful in providing a useful series of
typologies that can be used to organize
information about any one country. The
polynomial regression analysis that was
used is also an apparently effective statistical method for supporting what is indicated by the conceptual model.

Governments have tried to alter their
country’s fertility rate by various means.
But, they lacked an understanding of
what the relationship is between governmental action, the population’s reproductive behavior, and fertility change.
Given the importance of population control, a necessary and sufficient condition
for successful control is a better understanding of population dynamics themselves. While intentions may be good,
when fertility programs are enacted within
the framework of a “hit and miss” model,
they may produce results that are entirely
unintended. The impact may even work
against the intended effects, resulting in
unexpected, perhaps even dangerous,
short- and long-term effects.

This study is an attempt to discover the
“how” of governmental action and fertility. The author believes that, with some
modifications, the model can be used ef

fectively to identify, organize, and
perhaps predict fertility policy and program effects on fertility through structural
and cultural components. Such a result
would bring the possibility of rational
population control that much closer.
