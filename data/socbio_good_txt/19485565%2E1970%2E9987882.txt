The Trend of Interfaith Marriage

in the United States

Larry Bumpass

Depariment of Sociology
University of Wisconsin
Madison, Wisconsin

Although there is a substantial literature
on interfaith marriage, there is virtually no
treatment of trends in this phenomenon in
the United States—for the obvious reason
that no official national data exist. Only
Iowa and Indiana record religion on their
marriage certificates, and these states only
since 1953 and 1959 respectively. The most
suggestive data on this subject to date come
from David Heer’s report (1962) of Canadian interfaith-marriage rates from 1927 to
1957, and these data reveal] a virtually uninterrupted trend toward higher rates of interfaith marriage in Canada. As Heer implies,
it is not at all unreasonable to suppose that
the experience of the United States was
similar during this period. This series has
been brought up to date, and the Canadian
trend has continued from 1957 to 1967, apparently accelerating since 1962 (Table 1).
The proportion of Canadian brides and
grooms marrying a spouse of different faith
has increased from 6% in 1927 to 16% in
1967,

Although such a national time series does
not exist for the United States, we can estimate the trend through the comparison of
marriage cohorts in the 1965 National Fertility Study (NFS), a national sample of

 

some 5,600 married women living with their
husbands (see Ryder and Westoff, in press).
However, there are several methodological
problems in this approach which require
careful attention.

The fact that the data were collected at a
single point in time means that there is an
exact relationship between marriage cohort
and duration of marriage. Consequently, the
earlier the cohort, the greater the exposure
to possible causes of underrepresentation of
interfaith marriages. The restriction of the
sample to married women living with their
husbands would be less problematic in this
regard if information had been collected on
previous husbands for women married more
than once. Since such information was not
collected, it is necessary to confine this analysis to women who have been married only
once, and this may be a source of bias. If, as
is generally reported,! interfaith marriages
are less likely to succeed, earlier cohorts
have been exposed longer to this differential
risk of failure. As a consequence of such differential risk, a lower proportion of all interfaith marriages of earlier than that of later
cohorts will be intact at the date of inter

view and thus included in the sample. A resulting “trend” might be observed even if
there were no intercohort change in interfaith marriage.

A similar bias exists if there is a tendency
for those who marry a spouse of a different
faith to eventually adopt the faith of that
spouse. Such a tendency has particularly
been reported for husbands (Warren, 1970).
If homogamy increases over the course of
marriage, then a higher proportion of all
heterogamous marriages occurring to the
cohort will be represented for the more recent than for the earlier cohorts. This factor,
as well as marital instability, could result in
an artifactual trend in cross-sectional data
on interfaith marriage.

The present analysis is restricted to white
women because there are few Negroes of the
Catholic or Jewish religion. Intermarriage is
defined as marriage out of one of the three
major religious groups in the United States.”
More refined analysis would include a consideration of Protestant denominations, but

2Slightly differing definitions are possible, but

bility with the Canadian time series reported by

our sample size will not support that level of
detail here.

With these qualifications in mind, we can
turn to the NFS data in Table 2. When marriage cohorts are compared with respect to
the proportion of individuals in the three
major religious groups whose spouse is of a
different faith, there is virtually a linear increase over time in the proportion in interfaith marriages, from 7% in the 1935-39
marriage cohort to 14% in the marriage cohort 1960-65. In this most recent cohort,
11% of the Protestants and 20% of the
Catholics are in interfaith marriages. The
series for Jews is less regular, although there
is some indication of a trend. (The number
of Jewish sample cases is very small and the
proportions for the total sample result primarily from Protestant-Catholic marriages.)

To what extent is this observed trend
artifactual? Unfortunately, there is no ready

t This is the number relevant to sampling variability since
the sampling unit is married couples. The number of individuals on Which the proportions are based is slightly less than
twice the number of marriages, the difference depending on the
number of outmarriages.

answer to this problem. Some estimate of
the artifactual component may be made by
comparing the same marriage cohorts as
sampled in 1955 and again ten years later.*
It is precarious to test for differences as
small as those observed here between two
samples drawn under slightly different procedures. However, for the marriage cohorts
1940-54, the proportion of married individuals in interfaith marriages is 0.10 as measured in 1955 as compared to 0.08 as measured in 1965, a difference that would be
expected randomly only 3% of the time under the assumption that these are independent random samples of the same population. If we accept 0.02 as an estimate of the
effect of selective attrition in interfaith marriages over a ten-year period, we might conclude that about half of the observed trend
is artifactual, since an increase of 0.04 was
measured between the marriage cohorts of
1950-54 and 1960-65 in the retrospective
data, Even so, there would be some evidence
of an upward trend in interfaith marriage.
However, we noted earlier that in the Canadian vital statistics (where the problems of

attrition are absent) there is a unilinear upward trend in interfaith marriage. Figure 1
plots both the NFS and the Canadian data,
and the similarity between the two is striking. With the exception of the recent acceleration, the Canadian trend is less steep than
the slope based on the NFS data and may
well indicate what would be measured for the
United States in the absence of the biases
discussed earlier, Taking these sample biases
into account, the NFS data lend support to
the thesis that the trend of interfaith marriage in the United States has been similar
to the trend observed in Canada.

For those concerned with the intergenerational transmission of religious identity, parental religion may be a more relevant variable for comparison than current religion.
However, the measurement of trends in interfaith marriage as defined by this variable
is even more problematic than when intermarriage is defined by current religion.
Briefly, for conceptual clarity it is necessary
to exclude individuals whose parents were of
different faiths; but the effect of this procedure may be to exclude those least inclined
to religious endogamy. This would be a cumulative bias if interfaith marriages had
increased over the parental generation as

well. At any rate, when intercohort comparisons are made with respect to the proportion of individuals married to a spouse
whose parents’ religion differs from their
own parents’ religion, there is evidence of an
uneven increase over the time period represented (Table 3). In the most recent cohort,
17% of all married individuals whose parents were of the same faith married spouses
whose parents were of a different faith. The
proportions are 12% among Protestants and
30% among Catholics.

loosening of these norms as part of an overall
secularization of society (Heer, 1962, p.
252). Perhaps so; but there are additional
factors that should be considered. It is frequently noted that the probability of interfaith marriage is limited by the relative sizes
of the religious groups involved (Heer, 1962;
Besanceney, 1965). While the numerical
availability of potential mates of differing
religions is one factor affecting intermarriage
rates, there are a number of other variables
that should be considered as well. Figure 2
presents schematically some of these additional relationships that may be relevant to
changes in interfaith marriage rates.
Although Figure 2 could be elaborated
upon at some length, such is not the purpose
of this paper. The general point to be made
is that endogamous norms are only part of a
complex web of factors affecting intermarriage. It has been frequently demonstrated
that among the more important factors in
assortative mating are propinquity and social and economic similarity (Warren, 1966;
Catton and Smircich, 1964). Historically,
religious groups in the United States have
been quite dissimilar both with respect to
ethnic origin and socioeconomic status, and
such dissimilarity would operate against interfaith marriages through a number of
routes, only one of which would be the effect
on endogamous norms. Spatial segregation
with respect to ethnic and social status is
well documented as is the social segregation
of peer group relations among those living in
the same area (Duncan and Duncan, 1960;
Louman and Guttman, 1966).
Consequently, ethnic and socioeconomic
dissimilarity of religious groups would affect
intermarriage rates indirectly through patterns of spatial and social segregation as well
as directly through endogamous norms with
respect to status and ethnicity. If religious
groups have become more similar over time,

we might expect a consequent increase in
interfaith marriage whether or not there has
been a loosening of endogamous norms.

Indeed, there has been a marked increase
in ethnic and socioeconomic similarity between Protestants and Catholics over the
period under consideration (U.S. Bureau of
the Census, 1965, Table 9). As evidenced in
Table 4, the parents of Catholics married
between 1935 and 1939 were substantially
less educated than those of Protestants who
married during those years; on the other
hand, for the 1960-65 marriage cohort, the
educational backgrounds of Protestants and
Catholics are virtually identical.

Similar convergence has occurred with
respect to ethnic background. Catholics who
are foreign born or whose parents are foreign
born come overwhelmingly from different
ethnic groups than Protestants of foreign
birth or parentage. For the whole United
States, the proportion of individuals in the
prime marriage ages (15-25) of foreign birth

or parentage has declined steadily from 36%
in 1930 to 16% in 1960.

Separate estimates for Protestants and
Catholics indicate parallel declines. Since
the effect of ethnic origin on both place of
residence and style of life decreases markedly with time since immigration, we would
expect that ethnic differences between Protestants and Catholics of marriage age have
declined markedly over this period. Although a higher proportion of the earliest
cohorts are Protestant, changes in the relative sizes of religious groups could not have
accounted for the trend in interfaith marriages after the marriage cohorts of 1945-49,
Numerical dissimilarity has slightly increased since this cohort, since 65% of the
1960-65 cohort is Protestant compared with
63% of the 1945-49 marriage cohort.!

4 The usual statistical procedure for removing the
effects of numerical dissimilarity is inappropriate for
trend analyses. The ratio of observed rates to rates
expected randomly on the basis of the marginals
implies a unique set of marginals. See Blau and
Duncan, 1967, p. 90-97.

SUMMARY ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

In summary, there has been a trend toward interfaith marriage over the last 25
years in the United States. Although the
complexity of the web of factors affecting
interfaith-marriage rates makes causal inference hazardous, it is likely that increasing
religious similarity with respect to ethnic
and socioeconomic background has played a
major role in this trend.
