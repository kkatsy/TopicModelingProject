ABSTRACT: Recent studies have demonstrated an increased occurrence of interracial marriages
in the United States, indicating important shifts in intergroup relations. The effectiveness of
traditional theoretical approaches in explaining who marries whom, however, remains problematic. Recently, exchange explanations (which have typically assumed that the black partner
in the union exchanges educational and economic accomplishments for the higher “status” of
the white spouse) have been replaced by progressive theories emphasizing a trend away from
ascriptive and toward achievement norms. We extend this approach by predicting an economic
and educational gap between spouses in interracial marriages when compared with racially
homogamous marriages. Using the 1980 and 1990 Public Use Microdata Sample, we find
continuing evidence that racial barriers in mate selection are weakening. Further, people who
intermarry, regardless of race or gender, tend to have higher educational and economic status
than those in homogamous marriages. There is still limited support for the kinds of social
exchanges between spouses that were implied in earlier sociological theories. We conclude that
(1) socioeconomic differentials are not always consistent with the exchange perspective and (2)
that recent trends are not systematically eroding these socioeconomic differentials in mate

 

selection.

Over half a century ago, Robert K.
Merton (1941) observed that all societies develop a system of mate selection which serves to regulate who may
marry whom. The incest taboo, which
proscribes marriages between members of the same elementary family
unit, is generally regarded as the definitive example. The practical application of this taboo requires the mate selection process to include only persons
who are dissimilar on a prescribed set
of criteria—in this instance, omitting
those who are blood relatives. Marriage rules also specify that persons
whose backgrounds are foo dissimilar
are less suitable mates, as well (Merton, 1941, p. 361). Generally, such
rules have resulted in a preference for
marriage partners with similar race,
educational, family status, and age

characteristics. In practice, the outcome of these rules defining both who
is and who is not an acceptable mate is
a set of social norms that define some
optimal level of difference. Such norms
vary significantly from one society to
another, depending upon culturallydetermined preferences and expectations.

Social science research on mate selection has often focused on patterns of
interracial marriage within a given society, both because such patterns are
an indicator of the nature of race relations and because they measure important social changes that may be occurring. In fact, patterns of interracial
marriage were often considered a prototype indicator of intergroup relations
earlier in this century and, as such, attracted substantial research attention

(see, for example, Bernard, 1966;
Davis, 1941; Drachsler, 1921; Golden,
1953; Heer, 1966; Merton, 1941; Reuter, 1931; van den Berghe, 1960). For
the last couple of decades, however,
such research has been far less prominent, despite the fact that there has
been increased attention devoted to
the study of interracial comparisons on
such topics as mortality and morbidity,
income, employment, education, residence, and other basic demographic
patterns (Kalmijn, 1993). More recently, several studies have addressed
changing patterns in interracial marriage, treating these changes as an indicator of important shifts in intergroup. relations (Kalmijn, 1993;
Schoen and Wooldredge, 1989; Tucker
and Mitchell-Kernan, 1990).
Theoretical explanations of changing marriage choices point to changes
in the relative importance of achieved,
as opposed to ascriptive, criteria in determining a variety of life choices and
opportunities. This paper will build on
recent work examining trends and
patterns of interracial marriage between 1980 and 1990. First, we address
the question of whether important tendencies observed by the above studies
have continued. Second, we compare
mean levels of education and income
for husbands and wives in mixed and
same-race marriages. Finally, we develop multivariate models predicting
the likelihood of interracial marriage.

BACKGROUND

HISTORICAL PATTERNS
OF INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE

Historically, the occurrence of interracial marriages in the United States

Heaton and Albrecht

 

Social Biology

has been very low. At the turn of the
century, for example, studies conducted in several major cities found
that less than 1 per cent of all black
marriages involved a white spouse
(cited in Kalmijn, 1993, p. 122). These
rates changed very modestly over the
next several decades. Glick (1970)
notes, for example, that in 1960, only
about four marriages out of every one
thousand were interracial. Beginning
in the 1960’s, however, the pattern began to shift. Heer (1974) reports a 26
per cent increase in the number of
black-white marriages during the decade of the 1960’s, and this pattern of
increasing rates has apparently continued to the present. Kalmijn (1993) observes that the percentage of black
men outside the South who married a
white woman was 3.9 per cent in 1968,
but greater than 10 per cent by 1986.
For black women outside the South,
the increase was from 1.2 per cent to
3.7 per cent. Based on his findings, interracial marriages in the South between blacks and whites continue at a
much lower rate, but even here important changes have occurred, especially
in the number of black men who marry
white women.

While increases have occurred for
each combination (white husband/
black wife and black husband/white
wife), current research on interracial
marriages consistently indicates marriages involving a black male and a
white female are more common. At
the other end of the continuum, the
least frequent pattern has been white
men marrying black women. Heer
(1974), in fact, found a modest decrease in the occurrence of this type of
marriage for the decade between 1960
and 1970 and, while that may have now

Vol. 43, No. 3-4

reversed, previous research suggests
that it remains the less acceptable combination. |

A number of factors are probably
important in understanding the increased occurrence of black/white marriages. Bound and Freeman (1989)
note that with the passage of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 and the development of a variety of other affirmative
action programs, there was a substantial movement of young educated
blacks into the mainstream of the
American economy and the relative income of black workers began to rise
sharply. The number of blacks who
sought advanced educational opportunities also increased, thus narrowing,
at least for a time, the racial gap in education. These factors may have created increased opportunities for black/
white contact in more status-equal
situations, increasing, in turn, oppor
tunities for social interaction and mar
riage. It is important to note, however,
that a weaker economy, combined with
a changing political environment during the Reagan-Bush era, caused the
rate of black economic progress to slow
dramatically and seems also to have affected the number of blacks seeking
advanced education (Bound and Freeman, 1989). Nevertheless, available
data indicate that patterns of increased
occurrence of black/white marriages
continue, suggesting the importance of
non-economic factors in the selection
process.

Perhaps of greater importance than
changes in economic circumstances
have been changes in white prejudice
toward blacks (Feagin, 1991; Schuman,
Steeh, and Bobo, 1985). Firebaugh
and Davis (1988), for example, note
significant decreases in the occurrence

Interracial Marriage

 

205

of antiblack prejudice. Three major
findings emerge from their research:
(1) antiblack prejudice as measured by
questions in the General Social Survey
has declined steadily in recent years;
(2) the decline stems in significant part
from cohort replacement (the replacement of older, more prejudiced cohorts with younger, less prejudiced
ones), as well as from attitude change
itself; and (3) though absolute levels of
antiblack prejudice remain significantly higher in the South, prejudice is
declining more rapidly in the South,
resulting in shrinking regional differences. Each of these factors suggest
that socially prescribed norms have
changed quite significantly.

We must also note elimination of the
proscription on certain out-group marriages that was institutionalized into
law in a number of states in this country. While there were some differences
from one state to another, the general
intent of these laws was to bar the marriage of persons of color to whites. In
1967, the United States Supreme
Court, in Loving vs. Virginia, found
such laws unconstitutional. While the
timing of this decision is consistent
with the major upturn in interracial
marriages, there is little evidence suggesting that this formal deinstitutionalization has been a major factor in affecting actual practice. Instead, both
the challenge of state miscegenation
laws and the increase in interracial
marriages probably reflect changes in
attitudes and socially prescribed norms
on mate selection.

THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES
ON MATE SELECTION

Much prior work relies heavily on
an exchange perspective and argues

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

206

that each partner in the union Is trading
something of value to the other in exchange for something they value in
return. In the non-interracial union,
for example, it was often argued that
women sought men who had college
educations or who exhibited good
earning potential, while men were primarily concerned with finding a physically attractive mate or one who could
provide other domestic and social advantages (Bersheid and Walster, 1974;
Buss, 1985). Thus, males “exchanged”’
economic advantage for the desired
value of physical attractiveness or
domestic skill. Applied to black/white
marriages, the theory suggests two
types of socioeconomic differences.
People who marry someone of a different race will have distinctive socioeconomic characteristics both in comparison to their spouse and to persons
of the same race who marry endogamously. For example, black men who
marry white women will have higher
educational and economic positions
relative to other black men, as well as
relative to their white brides. Thus,
white women “exchange” the social
status that comes with their race for the
economic security of successful black
men (Schoen and Wooldredge, 1989).
This model assumes that being black
is a devalued trait that must be compensated for with some other social or
economic advantage.

The notion that spouses exchange
other types of status for racial advantage or disadvantage, initially advanced by Merton (1941) and Davis
(1941), has been highly controversial,
despite its general popularity. Bernard
(1966), for example, found no significant proclivity for wives of black males
to be of relatively lower educational attainment if white than if black. Neither

Heaton and Albrecht

 

Social Biology

did she find any evidence that black females had husbands with relatively
lower educational attainment if white
than if black. It is important to note,
however, that Bernard’s work does not
address the issue of whether or not
black males with relatively high statuses were more likely to have white
wives than black males with relatively
lower statuses.

Monahan (1976) also challenged the
Merton-Davis thesis. His work found
no distinguishable degree of “‘marrying
up” or “marrying down” in black/
white unions. In fact, a case by case
comparison of relative occupational
position of husband and wife indicated
a strong preference for equality. When
there was a difference, more often
both white men and white women married a black of lower occupational
status. Burma, Cretser, and Seacrest
(1970), similarly found no significant
difference in the proportion of intermarrying and intramarrying couples
having approximately the same occupational status levels.

Three recent studies, however, have
provided some empirical support for
the earlier thesis. Tucker and MitchellKernan (1990), using data from marriages in Los Angeles County, found
that black men who married white
women were more likely to be employed, had higher incomes, were
older, and were older at age of first
marriage. Using data from Virginia
and North Carolina, Schoen and Wooldredge (1989) found that in mixed race
marriages, departures from homogamy
were more likely to involve white females marrying better educated black
males. They conclude that “the observed departures from homogamy
could generally be interpreted as reflecting the female’s greater emphasis

 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 43, No. 3-4

on the male’s economic status, the
male’s greater emphasis on the female’s social status, or both”? (Schoen
and Wooldredge 1989, p. 478). That
white women would be more likely to
marry black men of higher status
would clearly fit the long held notion of
women “marrying up.” Finally, Kalmijn (1993, p. 142), in a study of black/
white intermarriage from marriage license data for 33 states between 1968
and 1986, concluded that when black
men marry white women, “these
unions tend to involve high status black
males and lower status white females.
Moreover, the tendency for white
women to be upwardly mobile in
mixed marriages has remained fairly
stable in the last two decades. It seems
that even though the extent of boundary crossing has become more common, the nature of these marriages has
remained traditional in the sense that
racial caste prestige and socioeconomic
prestige still function as substitutes in
the selection process.”

An increasingly important shift in
mate selection patterns may be underway in this country, however, and this
shift may have substantial implications
both for the frequency of black/white
marriages and for efforts to explain
their occurrence. Kalmijn (1991) describes this as a shift from ascription
to achievement in marriage selection
and notes that it is consistent with
other important stratification-related
changes. For example, theorists on
stratification are now arguing that ascriptive criteria such as class background and race are less important in
determining life chances than are
achieved qualities, such as educational
attainment (Featherman and Hauser,
1978). Kalmijn’s analysis of mate selection patterns shows that education (de
Interracial Marriage

207

fined as an achieved status) is now a
more important boundary in marriage
selection than social-class origin (an
ascribed status) and that educational
homogamy in marriage has increased
over time. A recognition of the increased importance of achieved statuses in mate selection also addresses,
at least indirectly, an important weakness of the initial Merton/Davis thesis:
its failure to give adequate attention to
the availability of partners by race and
by educational attainment. As we have
seen from recent empirical findings,
increased opportunities for interracial
contact, particularly in more statusequal settings, increases the probability of interracial marriage, an idea that
was clearly underdeveloped in the initial exchange formulation.

Applied to interracial marriage, this
model suggests an increased importance of similarity in achieved statuses
(such as education and income) and
less importance of similarity in ascribed statuses (such as race). Thus,
the frequency of interracial marriages
would increase while differences in
achieved statuses of partners in interracial marriages would decrease. Furthermore, while social exchange theories may still have some importance,
the nature of the things “‘exchanged”’
will have shifted. For example, rather
than one partner (a black male, in this
instance) exchanging higher educational and income attainment for the
social status associated with marrying a
white female, both will place greater
value on commonly valued goods (such
as educational attainment), resulting in
greater marital homogamy on these
achieved criteria.

In summary, exchange theory models of marriage propose that black race
is viewed as a negative trait and must
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

208

be compensated for by the presence
of other valued characteristics. Thus,
blacks who marry whites are expected
to have above average SES, while the
reverse would be the case for whites
who marry blacks. However, recent
trends in marriage patterns suggest a
decline in the importance of ascriptive
traits (such as social class background
and race) and an increase in the importance of achieved status (education
and income). Evidence that interracial
matriage is increasing and that negative attitudes toward such unions are
decreasing would support this general
contention, as would findings of increased homogamy on major achieved
statuses among partners in interracial
marriages.

To address recent trends in mate
selection, we derive four research hypotheses:

1. Consistent with recent trends reported in the literature, we predict increased rates of interracial marriage
over the decade 1980-90.

2. According to exchange theory, whites
who marry blacks will have lower status than other whites, but blacks in interracial marriages will have higher
status than other blacks.

3. As women are more concerned with
the socioeconomic status of their
spouse than are men, the tendency to
marry up will be particularly evident
for white women who marry black
men.

4. Because of social trends reducing barriers against interracial marriage, the
differences in #2 and #3 will decline
over the decade from 1980 to 1990.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data for this analysis are taken from
the 1980 and 1990 Public Use Micro
Heaton and Albrecht

 

Social Biology

data Sample (PUMS). All married persons with spouse present were selected
from the 1 per cent sample, and husbands and wives were matched. Because the resulting file was large (over
one million married couples) we sampled 10 per cent of the most common
type of marriage—those between white
non-Hispanic husbands and wives.
Analysis will focus on four groups defined by husband’s and wife’s race
(white or black). Hispanics and all other
races are excluded from the analysis.

Most recent studies of interracial
marriage rely on information from
marriage certificates. This source of
data has certain advantages. Information is recorded at the time of the marriage and all legal marriages are included for reporting states, but not all
states report. In the most comprehensive study, only 33 states were included
(Kalmijn, 1993). In comparison, census data does not include information
on marriage date in 1990 or on race of
spouse in marriages that have been terminated. The main advantages of census data are geographic coverage and
breadth of information.

Lack of information on terminated
marriages in census data is not a fatal
problem for two reasons. First, exchange models used to predict marital
choice can also be applied to marital
stability such that complementary hypotheses can be used to explain the
dual processes of choice and permanence that lead to prevalence of given
marriage patterns in cross-sectional
data. Second, the percentage of interracial marriages reported in crosssectional data more accurately reflects
contemporary marriage structures than
does data on rate of occurrence. Census data are also preferable because
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 43, No. 3-4

they allow the distinction between
Hispanic and non-Hispanic groups.
Exclusion of Hispanics eliminates the
potentially confounding influence of
marriages between blacks and Hispanics. Finally, census data include information on income. Although education is certainly an important measure
of socioeconomic status, it is only one
indicator. Income is a better indicator
of standard of living and may be at
least as important as education in mate
selection. Unfortunately, income is reported for the year prior to the census,
and no information is available about
income at the time of marriage. We assume that current income is correlated
with potential income at the time of
marriage and reflects economic characteristics that cannot be measured solely
by education.

We will first analyze marriages including all age groups. Then, to focus
attention on the most recent trends, we
will conduct a comparable analysis for
married couples where each spouse is
age thirty or younger. Sample sizes are
reported in Table 1.

In order to compare the status of
those in homogamous and heterogamous marriages, we compare mean
values of education and earnings for
husbands and wives in each type of
marriage. Then, to examine the probability of an interracial marriage by
levels of these characteristics, we estimate binomial logistic regression models predicting the likelihood of interracial marriage. Although other methods
are better able than logistic regression
to take into account racial and sexual
differences in the distributions of education and income (Kalmijn, 1991,
1993; Schoen and Wooldredge, 1989),
these methods become unwieldy when

Interracial Marriage

209

multiple independent variables are
included. Age is included as a control
variable. Recognizing important regional differences in the pattern of interracial marriage, a dummy variable is
included for residence in the south.
Earnings in 1980 are adjusted for inflation to match 1990 values. Education variables are recoded to adjust for
differences in coding in the two censuses. Exact comparability between
the two decades is impossible, but is
not essential to our analysis. To create
approximate comparability, years of
schooling in 1980 is reduced by 1 if the
grade was not completed and responses in each census are recoded into
similar categories that reflect years of
schooling completed.

RESULTS

Our results demonstrate that the
pattern of increased frequency of interracial marriage reported in the literature continues through the decade of
the 1980’s. Heer (1974) reports that 0.8
per cent of black males were married to
white women in 1960, increasing to 1.2
per cent in 1970. According to our
data, this percentage increased to 2.6
in 1980 and 4.2 in 1990. The trend appears less dramatic if we calculate the
percentage of white women married to
black men. Heer (1974) reports 0.07
per cent in 1960, and 0.1 per cent in
1970, increasing in our data to 0.22 per
cent in 1980 and 0.29 per cent in 1990.
Comparing the same two data sources,
the percentage of black females married to white males decreased from 0.8
per cent in 1960 to 0.7 per cent in 1970,
did not change in 1980, and then increased to 1.5 per cent in 1990. Likewise, the percentage of white males

married to black females dropped from
0.07 in 1960 to 0.06 in 1970, did not
change in 1980, and increased to 0.1 in
1990.

Table 2 shows the odds of an interracial marriage based on matched husbands and wives in the 1980 and 1990
censuses. Two prominent patterns are
evident in these data. First, as would
be expected given relative sizes of the
two groups, each interracial marriage
involves a larger proportion of blacks
than whites. Second, marriages between black men and white women are
more than three times as common as
marriages between black women and
white men.

Clearly, the rise in interracial marriage continues to be reflected in the
most recent data. The least common
marriages—white husband and black
wife—have experienced the greatest
increase, doubling in the ten-year
interval. Marriages between white
women and black men have also increased by about 60 per cent. These
rather dramatic relative increases in
interracial marriages represent only
slight increases in the actual per cent of
interracial marriages, however. For example, if marriages were strictly color
blind, the odds that a white man would

be married to a black woman rather
than a white woman would be 0.079 in
1990. The observed odds in 1980 of
0.0006 would need to increase by about
132 times to reach the odds of 0.079
representing random marriage in 1990,
but it only increases by a factor of
about two. Thus, the change occurring
in the 1980’s narrowed the gap between the 1980 pattern of homogamous marriage among white males
and the hypothetical model of random
marriage by ouly about 1.5 per cent
(2/132 = 0.015). Results for younger
couples show a higher likelihood of
interracial marriage, slightly greater
increases in white-male—black-female
marriages, and slightly smaller increases in white-female—black-male
marriages.

Table 3 compares the mean education and earnings of spouses in each
type of marriage. Long-standing socioeconomic differences by race and gender are evident in these data. Beyond
these inequalities, the most striking
pattern is that spouses in interracial
marriages have higher status than do
spouses of the same race in homogamous marriages. Higher education is
observed in interracial marriages, for
the total and the young cohort, for

men and women, and for both races,
the only exception being white females
married to black males aged 30 or
younger in 1980. Income is higher in
interracial than in same race marriages
in each case except those involving
white women and black men. While
this pattern has been observed previously for the education of black males
marrying white females (Kalmijn,
1993), its tendency across decades,
genders, age groups, races, and measures of status gives it greater importance.

The exchange model implies relatively large status differences between
black husbands and white wives because the men must have high socioeconomic status to be attractive. In
contrast, there should be a smaller difference between white husbands and
black wives because the man’s status
would be relatively low while the reverse would be the case for the wives.
Spouse differences in interracial marriages reported in Table 3 are consistent with this prediction. Both the
education and income gaps between

husband and wife are larger in blackhusband-white-wife marriages than in
white-husband—black-wife marriages.
Income gaps tend to be largest, however, in white-white marriages. Education differences tend to favor the wife,
and income gaps are smallest in blackblack marriages. Because of the relatively high status of partners in interracial marriages in comparison with
same race marriages the exchange
model does not adequately predict
spouses’ socioeconomic differences in
these marriages.

In order to sort out influences of
gender, race, and type of marriage,
means in Table 3 were subjected to further analysis. Regression equations
were estimated predicting income and
education with sex, race, a race-sex
interaction, and a dummy variable for
interracial marriage. Results are presented in Table 4.

the coefficients for interracial marriage

for race and sex. As is clear from Table
4, interracial marriages are marked by

higher status. Furthermore, three of

the four comparisons indicate the status advantage has increased rather
than decreased over the decade.

The remainder of Table 4 reports residuals after removing the average effects of race, gender, and type of marriage. Once these effects are removed,
education differences are generally
consistent with predictions of exchange

theory. Whites who marry blacks tend
to have relatively low educational status while the reverse is true of blacks
who marry whites. As exchange theory
also predicts, status effects are greater
for marriages between black men and
white women than for marriages between white men and black women in
the total sample, but not for those under age 30.

Patterns for income are less consistent than those for education. In the

total sample, white men who marry
black women have relatively low incomes, but younger men in 1990 are an
exception. Black women who marry
white men do have relatively high incomes in three of the four comparisons. No single pattern describes marriages between black men and white
women. In the total sample, black men
married to white women have relatively high earnings, but the same is not
true for the younger cohort. Contrary
to exchange theory predictions, white
women who marry black men tend to
have relatively high incomes, but the
young cohort in 1990 is an exception.
Because of small sample sizes and inconsistent results, income differences
in this case should be treated with caution. It seems clear, however, that income differences do not necessarily
mimic education differences. Thus, it is

not safe to assume that education alone
provides a complete accounting of status differences.

Results show no consistent support
for the hypothesis that status differentials are decreasing over time. Indeed,
several of the values presented in Table
4 are larger in 1990 than in 1980. It
would appear from this that status considerations in mate selection may be as
important in 1990 as they were in 1980.

Table 5 shows results of the logistic
regressions predicting the odds of
interracial marriage. Interracial mar-_
riages are less common in the south
than in the remainder of the country,
with the single exception of the percentage of white women aged thirty’
or less in 1990 married to black men.
While previous research has documented the much lower likelihood of
black/white marriages in the south,

attitudinal studies have shown that
antiblack prejudice has been declining
more rapidly here than in other areas
of the country (Firebaugh and Davis,
1988). Apparently, an important lag
remains between attitudinal change
and changes in practices such as mate
selection. Perhaps there will be a more
rapid rate of change in the south in
the future as behavioral changes catch
up with the liberalization of attitudes.
Overall, the probability of interracial
marriage decreases sharply with age,
and most of the decrease is probably
because of recent increases in interracial marriage.

Consistent with our finding that
spouses in interracial marriages tend
to have higher status, logistic regression results indicate that the likelihood
of interracial marriage tends to increase with education. The only exception to this pattern is among white
women, but three of the four coefficients are not statistically significant.
Comparison of education coefficients
across gender and race does support
the exchange perspective. Higher educational attainment is much more important for black men marrying white
women than for white women who
marry black men. Education coefficients for black women marrying white
men are only slightly higher than for
white men marrying black women in
the total sample, but differences are
greater in the thirty and under sample.
The fact that these differences in education coefficients are greater when
comparing white women and black
men than when comparing white men
and black women also supports the
notion that marrying up is particularly
important for white women who marry
interracially. Comparison of coeffi

cients across decades or by age group
shows no clear pattern of temporal
change. It appears that education is
about as important in 1990 as in 1980,
and for young couples as for all age
groups.

With education controlled, higher
earnings increase the likelihood of interracial marriage for white women.
This result is interesting because higher
education was correlated with interracial marriage for each group except
white women. The implied exchange of
wife’s income for husband’s education
in marriages between white women
and black men raises an interesting
question regarding the importance of
different aspects of social status in different types of marriage.

Income effects for other groups are
less clear. Among black men, higher
income was negatively associated with
interracial marriage in 1980 but not in
1990. Income coefficients are negative
for white men for three of the four
coefficients, as exchange theory would
predict. Coefficients are positive for
black women but none are statistically
significant. Thus, income coefficients
tend to fit the exchange model for marriages between white men and black
women, but not for marriages between
white women and black men.

DISCUSSION AND
CONCLUSIONS

Data from the most recent censuses
support the conclusion that racial barriers in mate selection are weakening.
Interracial marriages are more likely
in 1990 than in 1980, and in younger
cohorts. The least common type of
marriage— between black women and
white men—has increased at a faster

| pace than marriage between white

women and black men. Recent
changes, however, should not be overstated. The change between 1980 and
1990 narrowed the gap between observed 1980 patterns and expected patterns if marriage were random with respect to race by less than 2 per cent.
Early explanations for interracial
marriage assumed that because their
race was viewed as a negative characteristic, blacks who married whites
would need to substitute other advantages such as higher socioeconomic
status to compensate. Although some
early research did not fully support this
model, it has retained some credibility.
Perhaps the prominence of the model’s
proponents has played some role in
its persistence. From this model, we
expected to find lower status among
whites who marry blacks, and higher
status among blacks who marry whites.
Instead, the most prominent pattern in
these data is that people who marry interracially tend to have higher status,
regardless of race, than do those in
homogamous marriages. Interracial
marriage among higher status individuals could result both from structural
and social psychological tendencies.
Homans (1974) argues that higher status gives individuals more freedom to
violate norms. Structural isolation and
segregation, as noted by Wilson (1987)
and Massey and Denton (1993), reduce
the contact between  lower-status
blacks and whites. College attendance,
in particular, may play an important
role in increasing the pool of eligible
partners and in weakening traditional

' norms favoring ascriptive marriage.

Whatever the explanation, the proposition that higher socioeconomic status
facilitates interracial marriage deserves
further attention.

Heaton and Albrecht

 

Social Biology

Patterns of exchanging lower racial
status for higher socioeconomic status
emerge only after we take into account
the more dominant pattern of higher
socioeconomic status in interracial
marriages. The exchange pattern is
more clear for education than for income, however.

We do observe the anticipated
greater gaps between husband’s and
wife’s status in black-husband—whitewife marriages and smaller gaps in
black-wife—white-husband marriages.
This finding is consistent with the claim
that white women are more willing to
marry black men if they have higher socioeconomic status. Only after adjusting for the overall lower status of black
men does it appear that white women
marry up. When we also take into account income, results are even less
clear as higher earnings are predictive
of interracial marriage among white
women.

Clearly something more complex
than exchange of race for status is occurring. At.least four tendencies may
be involved in interracial marriage, including: (1) greater freedom to violate
norms among higher status individuals,
(2) some preference for similarity in
socioeconomic status, (3) exchange of
socioeconomic and racial characteristics, and (4) greater emphasis on socioeconomic roles of men. The combination of the first three tendencies would
increase the likelihood of interracial
marriage among high status individuals
and would result in the educational differences we observe once the larger effect of the first tendency is removed.

Finally, declining racial prejudice
and replacement of ascriptive norms by
achievement norms would imply both a
decline in the socioeconomic gap between spouses in interracial marriages

and a reduction in the ability of socioeconomic Status to predict interracial
marriage. Consistent with our fourth
hypothesis, the influence of socioeconomic status is waning in some cases,
but not uniformly. The decline is more
evident for education than income, but
even the change for education is not
uniform. Sufficient support can be
found that a wholesale rejection of the
exchange model seems premature, but

the model is far from adequate in accounting for recent trends. Clearly,
race remains one of the greatest barriers in marital choice in this country.
Willingness to cross this barrier depends in part on attainment of higher
socioeconomic status, regardless of the
race or gender of the spouses involved.
However, the processes leading to
modest declines in this barrier are not
yet well understood.
