Contraceptive Risk-Taking in a Medically
Underserved, Low-income Population

ABSTRACT: This study examines the phenomenon of contraceptive risk-taking, which is the
nonuse of contraception by women who are sexually active, fertile and not pregnant or trying
to become pregnant. Based on a survey sample of low-income women in their childbearing years
who had not received family planning care or advice from a doctor or clinic for at least three
years, the study analyzed demographic predictors of contraceptive risk-taking and also compared levels of contraceptive knowledge and pregnancy histories of noncontraceptors versus
barrier contraceptors. Contraceptive risk-taking was found to be higher for minority women, for
parous women, for those age 30 and younger, and for those whose knowledge of the fertility cycle
is incorrect, but risk-taking was found to be unrelated to the women’s marital status. Noncontraceptors were less knowledgeable concerning contraceptive methods and substantially more
likely to have had previous unwanted pregnancies due to nonuse of contraception, suggesting
that current contraceptive risk-taking probably represents a relatively enduring feature of

 

Since the advent of the “contraceptive revolution” three decades ago
(Lincoln and Kaeser, 1988), there have
been a plethora of studies seeking to
explain the apparent inconsistency between women’s desire to avoid unwanted pregnancies and their frequent
failure to avail themselves of readily
available means of contraception. This
failure of women to behave in accordance with a stated desire to avoid
pregnancy is defined here as ‘‘contraceptive risk-taking.” Luker (1975;
1977) found through interviews with
women visiting an abortion clinic that
deficits in contraceptive knowledge
historically used to justify the establishment of birth control clinics
(Kennedy, 1971) did not apply to her
study population, 80 per cent of whom
had been successful contraceptors at
some point in their lives (Luker, 1975,

reproductive behavior for a subgroup of the medically undeserved low-income population.

p. 89). She posited that levels of “‘risktaking” with regard to prevention of
unwanted pregnancies conform to risktaking behavior in other areas with relatively high-cost consequences and differ according to social and personal
circumstances that make contraceptive
use more or less costly and pregnancy
more or less beneficial. In this per-.
spective, the decision to contracept or
to risk an unwanted pregnancy is part
of a basically rational process, and
women are seen as moving in and out
of “risky” situations over the course
of their reproductive lives, based on
changes in their social and personal circumstances, rather than as successful
versus unsuccessful contraceptors in an
invariant sense (Luker, 1977, p. 194).

These social and personal circumstances include the woman’s age (especially as it relates to the social

248

 
Vol. 40, No. 3-4

boundaries of motherhood), marital
or cohabitation status, family-building
desires, and a variety of life-transition
circumstances (Luker, 1975, pp. 98105). Tests of this model in other populations, which have supplied evidence
both supporting (Philliber et al., 1986)
and refuting it (Crosbie and Bitte,
1982), have focused on perceived costs
and benefits associated with contracep= — tive risk-taking, without identifying the
a “life circumstances found in conjunction
5 2 with risk- taking behavior.
Other studies investigating the
®phenomenon of contraceptive nonoo use (among married women who did
hot wish to become pregnant), how= ever, have shown that women who are
= younger, poorer, black, nulliparous,
who had lower educational attainment,
sand who desired (additional) children
‘Sin the future were more likely to be
S contraceptive risk-takers (Hammer‘Sslough, 1984; Miller, 1986). Among
Snever-married women, contraceptive
o risk- -taking was higher for those with
-= greater numbers of sexual partners and
~ those with less knowledge concerning
scontraceptive effectiveness (Miller,
"3 1986).
3 Although only about 12 per cent of
"= women at risk of pregnancy do not
& use contraception, this group accounts
© for almost half of all unintended pregnancies (Forrest, 1987). Moreover,
low-income women are disproportionately affected by the consequences of
contraceptive risk-taking, since women
below the poverty level are 50 per
cent more likely than higher-income
women to have an unplanned pregnancy as the result of nonuse of contraception (Grady et al., 1986, p. 204)
and are almost three times as likely
to give birth to an unwanted child

(Williams, 1991). And while trend data
show that unwanted childbearing has
increased for women at all income levels, there has been an almost 75 per
cent increase for poverty-level women
between 1982 and 1988, which has
been attributed primarily to an increase in risk-taking behavior among
women at the lower end of the socioeconomic scale (Williams, 1991).

While the phenomenon of contraceptive risk-taking apparently exerts
a disproportionate impact upon lowincome women, existing studies of
associated life circumstances have not
focused specifically on low-income
populations, instead employing general population samples such as those
from the National Survey of Family
Growth (Pratt et al., 1984). In the
present study, survey data from
poverty-level and near-poverty-level
women residing in medically underserved inner-city areas are used to
identify social and personal circumstances that differentiate those likely to
be contraceptive risk-takers.

Because the survey focused on
women who had not received formal
family planning care in the recent past,
this analysis of contraceptive risk compares nonusers of contraception and
women who, although not utilizing the
most effective methods, are nevertheless utilizing some means to attempt to
prevent unwanted pregnancies. The
study questions are: (1) What are the
social and personal characteristics (including knowledge and attitudes) associated with contraceptive risk-taking
(nonuse of contraception when fertile, sexually active, and not pregnant
or trying to become pregnant; Dryfoos, 1975), by low-income women?
(2) What is the relationship between

contraceptive risk-taking, and both
reproductive knowledge and knowledge concerning specific contraceptive
methods, and history of wanted and
unwanted pregnancies?

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data for this study come from a survey conducted in low-income areas of
Los Angeles County in 1986. The target population for the survey consisted

of nonsterile women in their childbear- _

ing years who had not visited a clinic
or physician for family planning care
or advice within the preceding three
years. The sample was drawn from
census tracts in which at least 60 per
cent of the population was below the
200 per cent of poverty level in the
1980 census. A screening questionnaire was used to draw a Stratified random sample from among potential respondent households, as well as to
determine eligibility for the survey. A
woman was eligible for the study if she
was 18-44 years old (or under 18 if
married or cohabiting), if she and her
husband/partner were not sterile (including contraceptively), and if she had
not had a visit to a clinic or private physician that included family planning
care or advice in the previous three
years.

Using respondents’ self-designated
race/ethnicity and federal povertylevel criteria based on income and
family size (U.S. DHHS, 1985), the
screening questionnaire was used to
stratify the sample by racial/ethnic and
poverty-level groups. The resulting
respondent group has approximately
one-third non-Hispanic whites, onethird blacks, and one-third Hispanics,
and is also approximately equally divided into three poverty level groups:

Radecki and Beckman

Social Biology

below poverty, 100-149 per cent of
poverty, and 150+ per cent of poverty
level. Case-weights from the 1982
National Survey of Family Growth
(NSFG), have been applied to survey
data to reflect the national distributions of low-income women in
the three racial/ethnic groups. (Asian
women, who were excluded from the
sample, were the target population for
a separate family planning survey conducted in the San Francisco area by
Minkler et al., 1988.)

Interviews were conducted by
trained female interviewers; 79 per
cent of them were in English, 21 per
cent in Spanish. The response rate for
the survey was 82.6 per cent; nonresponse is comprised of 6.9 per cent refusals of eligible respondents and 10.5
per cent estimated eligible respondents
who failed for various reasons to complete the screening questionnaire.

SURVEY QUESTIONS

Information used in the analysis includes respondent’s pregnancy history,
sexual activity, fertility intentions, use
or nonuse of contraception, and fertility and contraceptive knowledge.
Other data related to access to family
planning care have been reported previously (Radecki and Bernstein, 1990).
The survey incorporated several questions replicated from Cycle III of the
National Survey of Family Growth to
measure respondent’s fertility intentions, knowledge of the menstrual cycle, frequency of sexual intercourse,
and reaction to a pregnancy. The
fertility-intentions question simply
asks, “looking into the future, do you
(and your husband) intend to have
a(nother) baby at some time?’’. The
menstrual-knowledge question asks,
“during the monthly menstrual cycle,
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

Vol. 40, No. 3-4

that is, from one period to the next,

would you say the average women is
most likely to become pregnant if
She has intercourse . . .”’ (followed by
a set of alternate answers). In this analysis, the most nearly correct answer,
“about two weeks after her period begins,” is contrasted with less correct

answers, including ‘“‘during her period” |

and “don’t know.” The frequency-ofintercourse question asked, “‘in the
last three months, how frequently
did you have intercourse?’’. Responses
to this question have been divided
into “weekly or more” and “‘less than
weekly.” The reaction-to-pregnancy
question is, “if you were to become
pregnant, what would you do?’’. In
the analysis, the answer “‘have the
baby and raise it’ is contrasted with
“would have an abortion” combined
with “don’t know’’; other alternatives
involving adoption were selected by
only a small number of respondents.

Finally, respondents were asked
about their pregnancy histories to determine the number of known pregnancies, whether carried to term or
aborted, and the woman’s circumStances at the time of conception. The
question on the number of pregnancies
is comparable to one used in the
National Survey of Family Growth,
while additional questions adapted
from a survey of adolescent fertility
(Aneshensel et al., 1989; 1990) were
used to determine the respondent’s intentions at the time of the pregnancy
and whether a contraceptive method
was used.

SUBPOPULATION FOR ANALYSIS

By means of questions on use of
contraception, sexual activity, and
pregnancy intentions, the survey determined that 41.5 per cent were currently

Contraceptive Risk-Taking

 

251

using some form of contraception, and
20.5 per cent were at risk of unwanted _
pregnancy but not using any type of
contraception. (An additional 25.0 per
cent of respondents were not sexually
active, and 13.0 per cent were pregnant
or trying to become pregnant.) In this
analysis we compare contracepting
women who reported use of a barrier
method—either a diaphragm or overthe-counter product—to noncontraceptors “at risk” for unwanted pregnancy. Excluded from the analysis are
women who reported use of an IUD,
who used ad-hoc methods of birth
control such as rhythm or withdrawal,
or who indicated to us that they were
somehow still using birth control pills
despite no physician/clinic visit in
more than three years. Thus, the “‘risktaking” group in this study is compared
to other medically underserved women
who utilize coitus-dependent barrier
methods.

As noted above, none of the respondents in either group had had a family
planning visit to a doctor’s office or
clinic within the preceding three years.
A question on family planning visits
found that 80 per cent of the contraceptor group had ever had such a
visit, compared to 70 per cent of the
noncontraceptors (P = 0.04). Among
those with a visit, the mean number of
years Since the family planning visit did
not differ between groups, averaging
approximately 4.5 years for both contraceptors and noncontraceptors. In
addition to the lack of recent family
planning care, these women’s access to
general medical care was limited, as
just 47 per cent reported having a regular physician, another 18 per cent utilized clinics, and 35 per cent indicated
having no source of general medical
care. This latter figure is almost double

252

the nationwide datum showing that
18.4 per cent of low-income individuals
lack a regular source of medical care
(Hayward et al., 1991). Therefore, in
contrast to previous analyses based on
general population samples such as
that included in the National Survey of
Family Growth (e.g., Hammerslough,
1984), the present analysis focuses specifically on a medically underserved,
low-income population. The case base
(N) for the analysis is 211 low-income
respondents. The weighted distribution of contraceptive use in this subgroup, based on the series of questions
noted above, is 56 per cent barriermethod contraceptors and 44 per cent
at risk noncontraceptors.

RESULTS
RISK TAKING

Crude odds ratios for factors associated with increased contraceptive
risk-taking (Table 1) show highest
risk for black or Hispanic women,
those with a high-school education or
less, those whose beliefs concerning
the most fertile period during their
monthly cycle are incorrect, and those
with income below the poverty level.
Using a significance level adjusted to
P< 0.004 by the Bonferroni correction
for multiple comparisons, we find the
other statistically significant factors associated with contraceptive risk-taking
are age 30 or younger, previous births,

and a low level of knowledge concern-.

ing contraceptive efficacy. Notably,
neither a woman’s current marital status nor her fertility intentions, frequency of intercourse or probable reaction to an (unwanted) pregnancy
significantly predict contraceptive risktaking.

Radecki and Beckman

Social Biology

When adjusted for the effects of
all significant factors by means of logistic regression, black and Hispanic
women, those with previous births,
those 30 and younger, and those
with incorrect knowledge of the fertility cycle show a greater tendency toward contraceptive risk-taking, with
adjusted odds ratios ranging from approximately 2.5 to 3.8 in magnitude
(Table 1), while income, educational
attainment and contraceptive knowledge are no longer statistically significant in the logistic model. There was
also a significant interaction (not tabled) between age and contraceptive
knowledge, as correct knowledge of
the reproductive cycle substantially
reduced risk-taking behavior among
women over 30 (P = 0.00001) but had
no significant impact on those age 30 or
younger (P = 0.55).

REPRODUCTIVE AND CONTRACEPTIVE
KNOWLEDGE

The two knowledge variables used
as predictors of contraceptive use in
Table 1 assume particular importance
in the analysis of risk-taking behavior.
While not among the most powerful
predictors of contraceptive use, they
are at least amenable to intervention,
in contrast to demographic characteristics and other exogenous factors
shown in Table 1.

Table 2 shows the complete distribution of answers to the reproductive
knowledge question which asked respondents to indicate when during the
menstrual cycle a woman is most likely
to become pregnant, if she has intercourse. As shown in the table, 72.8 per
cent of contraceptors gave the most
nearly correct answer (two weeks after
menstrual period) compared to 45.7

In Table 3, contraceptors are compared to noncontraceptors on their

rank order of effectiveness—sterilization, the pill, IUD, condom, diaphragm, and rhythm —is based on first

large number of studies of contraceptive failure, (Trussel and Kost, 1987;
Trussel et al., 1990). Using a corrected
significance level of P=0.01, we find
that contraceptive users are substantially more likely to identify correctly
birth-control pills as the second most
effective method. Women in both

Sterilization as the most effective

most common departure from the

(first-year failure rate, 18%) above
the condom (12% first-year failure)
(Trussel and Kost, 1987; Trussel et al.,
1990) and the assignment of a higher
effectiveness ranking to the diaphragm
relative to the condom was more frequent for contraceptors compared to
noncontraceptors. These contraceptive rankings in Table 2 were used to
create a summary score of the number
of correct answers for the two groups
of women. A comparison of these
scores (not tabled) showed an average
of 3.4 correct answers for the contracepting group, compared to 3.8
correct answers for noncontraceptors
(P = 0.001).

PREGNANCY HIsTorY

Data from respondents’ pregnancy
histories were used to categorize each
pregnancy (whether carried to term or
not) into one of three categories based
on original intent and use or nonuse of

contraception (Table 4). Mean numbers of abortions and total pregnancies
were also completed. Comparisons between contraceptors and noncontraceptors are shown in the table unadjusted, and adjusted for two of the
three predictors of contraceptive risktaking identified in the logistic regression (Table 1): race/ethnicity and an
age-derived measure of years of exposure to pregnancy. (The third, parity,
is of course a function of pregnancy history.)

Using a corrected significance level
of P =0.01, we find that the comparisons show that the pregnancy category
that differentiates between the two
groups is ‘‘unwanted pregnancies due
to nonuse of contraception,” which
is highly significant (P <0.001) even
when adjusted and accounts for more
than three times as many pregnancies
among the noncontracepting compared to the contracepting group. The
table reveals that significantly higher
mean numbers of pregnancies (P<
0.001) for the noncontracepting group
are due entirely to a history of nonuse
of contraception. Despite the contraceptive knowledge differences noted

above, method failure (e.g., of barrier
or ad hoc methods) does not contribute
to the difference, and mean numbers
of intended pregnancies are virtually
identical in the two groups.

The mean number of abortions is
approximately 60 per cent higher for
the contraceptor group, perhaps reflecting the impact of this experience
on the degree of conscientiousness regarding contraception. However, this
difference fails to achieve statistical
significance and becomes less significant when adjusted for race/ethnicity
and years of exposure to pregnancy.

Finally, data on respondents’ previous use of specific contraceptive methods (not tabled) show that contracept
ing women are more likely to have
used any of a list of methods on a regular basis (for at least a month) at some
time in their lives, although the difference is significant (P = 0.01) only for
condoms. In addition, there is a significant difference (P < 0.01) in the number of years current barrier contraceptors who ever used oral contraceptives
stayed on this method compared to
current noncontraceptors, who have
used oral contraceptives (4.3 years
compared to 2.4 years, after adjusting
for years of exposure to pregnancy),
suggesting a correspondence between
stability of use of prescription contraceptives and likelihood of current use
of nonprescription methods.

COMMENT

National data from Cycle IV of the
National Survey of Family Growth
(1988) show that among non-sterile
women at all income levels, 52.2 per
cent were using some form of contraception, 26.4 per cent were not sexually active, 12.2 per cent were pregnant
(or postpartum) or were seeking pregnancy, and 9.2 per cent were at risk of
unwanted pregnancy but not using contraception (Mosher and Pratt, 1990).
Comparing the latter figure to the total
“at risk” figure of 44 per cent in the
present study reveals a risk-taking odds
ratio of 4.5 attributable just to being a
member of this low-income population. The analysis of various factors associated with even greater risk in this
population revealed a number of sta
tistically significant predictors (crude
odds ratios of 2.25 or greater) but did
not corroborate previously noted effects of marital status (Bachrach, 1987)
or employment (Rindfuss, et al., 1988)
on use of contraception. Similarly, previous findings relating contraceptive
use to frequency of intercourse (Glor
and Severy, 1990) were not confirmed
in this population. Rather, key predictors of contraceptive risk-taking in this
low income population are: black or
Hispanic race/ethnicity, having one or
more previous births, age under 30,
and incorrect knowledge of the reproductive cycle. These categories, with
multivariate adjusted odds ratios for
risk-taking of 2.5 or greater, each confers a Significant degree of additional
exposure (beyond that applicable to
the study population as a whole) even

when other significant factors are controlled.

Analyses of these differences and of
respondents’ contraceptive knowledge
and pregnancy histories revealed additional differentials between these two
groups that call into question the concept of contraception risk-taking as a
transient situation based on social and
personal circumstances (cf. Luker,
1977). First, several of the significant
predictors of risk-taking constitute relatively enduring demographic characteristics of the individual, whereas the
clearly circumstantial factor of marital
status failed to significantly predict
contraceptive risk-taking.

Secondly, contraceptors and noncontraceptors differ in their knowledge
levels both with regard to reproductive
knowledge of the menstrual cycle, and
(to a certain extent) with regard to the
relative efficacy of contraceptive methods. While both types of knowledge
deficit are potentially remediable, the
finding of somewhat lower levels of
both types of knowledge in the noncontracepting group suggests that failure to practice contraception is a stable, enduring type of behavior that is
relatively immutable, rather than behavior in response to changing social
and personal circumstances. Third, the
pregnancy history data show patterns
of contraceptive nonuse to be of longstanding duration; in fact, contraceptive risk-takers have had an average of
1.3 unwanted pregnancies attributable
to previous nonuse of contraception.

Analyses of national survey data
have revealed that abandonment of
contraception altogether has become
increasingly common among women
who discontinue use of a specific
method (Grady et al., 1989). The im
Contraceptive Risk-Taking

257

plications of contraceptive risk-taking
implied by this trend are revealed by

projections that show that if the num
ber of women not using contraceptives
were reduced by half, it would prevent
one-third of all abortions, thereby
eliminating one-half million induced
abortions annually (Westoff, 1988).
Among this population of low-income
women not receiving any type of formal family planning care, of course,
both the proportion of noncontraceptors and the potential for reducing
unintended pregnancies through increased use of contraception exceed
comparable figures applicable to the
general population of childbearing age
women.

The study’s use of a stratified sample
of low-income women to examine
characteristics associated with contraceptive risk taking has therefore generated findings applicable to a particularly susceptible subpopulation. These
women, all of whom exist at the fringe
of economic viability, represent those
most vulnerable to deleterious effects
of (additional) unwanted childbearing,
and thus constitute an ideal population for examining predictors of variation in contraceptive risk-taking. On
the other hand, even though the sample data have been weighted to reflect
national proportions of women within
study strata, they naturally reflect
truncated distributions of income, education and other sociodemographic
characteristics. It may be, for instance,
that differences based (say) on educational attainment would not be found
among a more general population
with a broader distribution of educational attainment, as opposed to the
substantial proportion of grade-schoolonly women found in this study’s

population. And, of course, use of barrier methods of contraception can (for
some women) be considered a form
of risk-taking relative to the use of
more effective hormonal contraception. Thus one could regard even the
study’s contracepting group as relative
risk-takers vis-a-vis women who are
receiving formal family planning
care from a physician or clinic. Within
this medically underserved low-income
group, however, it is clear that contraceptive risk-taking occurs at significantly higher levels in demographically
defined sub-groups, and that it appears
to reflect a relatively established mode

of reproductive behavior rather than a
transient or occasional lapse in contraceptive utilization.
