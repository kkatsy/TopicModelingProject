to the Frequency of Marital Intercourse

ABSTRACT: Using three recent samples of American married couples of childbearing age, we
examined the relative contribution of male and female age to the decline in the frequency of
marital intercourse with age. Contrary to the widely held belief that only male age contributes to
the decline, we found a substantial contribution of female age. In the 1965 sample, the contribution of each sex was about the same. In the 1974 sample, the contribution of female age was much
more important than the contribution of male age. Two alternative explanations are offered.

This paper examines the relative contributions of male and female age to the
decline in the frequency of marital intercourse associated with age of the partners.
The firstsystematic data on the frequency of
sexual behavior by age were reported for
males by Pearl (1925) more than fifty years
ago. Pearl observed that a decline for males
set in as early as the third decade of life. He
concluded that were social constraints not
operating, the biological propensities of
males would probably create a peak level
before age 20, followed by decline.

Kinsey and his coworkers confirmed the
early onset of decline, proceeding directly
from a high point before 20 years of age.
They attributed the decline primarily to
physiologic capacity, noting that the decline
in frequency of male sexual behavior with
age is accompanied by a decline in sexual
responsiveness aS measured by rating
scales, frequency of morning erection,
speed in reaching full erection, length of
time over which erection can be maintained, angle of the erect penis, amount of
“precoital” mucus secreted, and capacity to
reach repeated climax (Kinsey et al., 1948).
While Kinsey and subsequent writers have

generally associated the gradual sexual decline from an early age in males with declining androgen production, later studies have
found plasma testerone levels and free
plasma testosterone concentration to remain within the same range from adolescence through age 50, only declining thereafter (Vermeulen et al., 1972).

Studies of infrahuman animals show an
age-related decline in the intensity and frequency of mating responses of males of
many species. While declines in androgens
associated with aging are accompanied by
declining sexual responses, the declines in
mating behavior occur long before declines
in androgens. This finding leads to the
conclusion that other aspects of aging cause
declines in male sexual behavior in the
period of life before androgen secretion
declines (Elias and Elias, 1975). Unfortunately, the animal literature is much less
instructive on the relationship between
aging and sexual behaviorin females. What
is certain is that sexual attractiveness as well
as sexual behavior of all infrahuman
females disappears in the absence of female
hormones (Timiras and Meisami, 1972).

published (Kinsey et al., 1953), the data
showed thesame decline in marital coitus by
age that was noted in the male data (see
Figure 1). The writers were careful to point
out that although this could easily be taken
for an indication of declining sexual capacity in females, the true explanation for the
decline in marital coitus with age was the
declining physiological capacity of their
male partners. They pointed out that when
the sexual behavior of single females was
examined, the decline by age did not occur.
Figure 2 gives the median frequency of
orgasm from allsources by age forall males,
all females, and single females, and the
median frequency of orgasm from masturbation by age for single females who masturbated.

While other indexes of single female sexual behavior might have been chosen for
comparison, the two indexes shown on Figure 2 do not offer unequivocal support for
the conclusion that there is no decline in
single female sexual behavior by age.

Nevertheless, it has become the prevailing
view that the declines in the frequency of
marital sex with age are caused by adecline
in male sexual desire and performance attributable to the physiology of aging. Subsequent writers have adopted the Kinsey
view that female sexual desire and performance are unaffected by aging and that
therefore female age does not contribute to
the decline in the frequency of marital intercourse. These conclusions have led to the
acceptance of Kinsey’s sad scenario as the
fate of marital sexuality.

One of the tragedies which appears in a
number of the marriages originates in the fact
that the male may be most desirous of sexual
contact in his early years, while the responses
of the female are still undeveloped and while
she is still struggling to free herself from the
acquired inhibitions which prevent her from
participating freely in the marital activity. But
over the years most females become less inhibited and develop an interest in sexual relations which they may then maintain until they
are in their fifties or even sixties. But by then
the responses of the average male may have

dropped so considerably that his interest in
coitus, and especially in coitus with a wife who
has previously objected to the frequencies of
his requests, may have sharply declined.
Many of the husbands in the sample reported
that early in their marriages they had wanted
coitus more often than their wives had wanted
it. Many of the younger married females reported that they would be satisfied with lower
coital rates than their husbands wanted. On
the other hand, in the later years of marriage,
many of the females had expressed the wish
that they could have coitus more frequently
than their husbands were then desiring it.
Most of the decline in the male’s interest may
have represented physiologic aging; part of it
may have been the product of a failure to work
out effective relations in the earlier years of
marriage; and part of it may have been a
product of the fact that a number of
the males—especially the better-educated
males—were engaging in extra-marital coitus
or other extra-marital sexual activities in their

forties and fifties at the expense of coitus with
their wives (Kinsey et al., 1953, pp. 353-354).

We are able to locate only one published
analysis of the effect of one sex on frequency
of intercourse, controlling for the age of the
other. James (1974) analyzed the 1965 National Fertility Study data for couples in
which both spouses were under 45 years of
age. Using controls for age of the other sex,
parity, and social class, he reported a negligible effect of female age and a substantial
effect for male age.

Studies discussed to this point are based
on behavior reports only. Two recent reports appear in the literature relating sexual
motivation to age. Eachshows more decline

women than on the part of men. The first
study is based on the use of a paper and
pencil personality inventory using a scale to
measure “libido” or sexual desire. In this
study, women showed a marked decline in
measured libido between their 20’s and their
50’s, while men showed no decline in libido
(Eysenck, 1977). The second study was
based on a representative national sample
survey of American males and females.
They were asked to rank a series of daily
activities according to the extent to which
they were asource of pleasure in life. Among
young men, sex was the clear leader, and
among middle-aged men it was first or
second among the twenty-two activities.
Among young women, sex ranked high, but
below music, nature, family, and travel.
Among middle-aged women, it ranked near
the bottom, below snoozing, watching television, and doing housework (Eysenck,
1977). These attitude studies, when combined with the behavioral and hormonal
data reviewed above, suggest that the customary interpretations of the decline in
marital sexual frequency with age must be
taken with caution.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The present study investigates the relative influences of the age of husband and age
of wife on the frequency of marital coitus in
three samples. The first sample is the 1965
National Fertility Study (NFS). Thesecond
sample is the 1970 NFS. The third sample is
the 1974 survey of the Family Planning
Evaluation Project (FPEP). The 1965 and

Age and Marital Intercourse

 

131

1970 NFS samples are area sample surveys
representative of currently married women
in the United States. The 1974 FPEP sample is an areasample survey of ever-married
women living in 16 selected U.S. cities. For
the present analysis, only currently married
white women under 45 years of age at
interview, with husband present, were included.

Data analysis consisted of multiple regressions of male and female age against
frequency ofintercourseas reported in questionnaire responses.

RESULTS

The main findings are displayed in Table
1. Inthe 1965 NFS data, husband’s age and
wife’s age contribute about equally to the
explanation of frequency of intercourse. In
the 1970 NFS data, the wife’s age is clearly a
much greater contributor than husband’s
age to explaining frequency of intercourse.
In the 1974 data, the importance of wife’s
age compared to husband’s age has increased over the 1970 data. Examination of
the unstandardized regression coefficients
reveals that while the coefficient for male
age hasstayed relatively constant, thesizeof
the coefficient for female age has increased
substantially in each later sample. In the
1965 sample, the frequency of intercourse
declines one per month for each ten-year
increase in age of the wife. In the 1974
sample the frequency of intercourse declines one per month for each four-year
increase in the age of wife.

meaning to the findings of Table 1. Table 2
shows that the overall frequency of intercourse increased in later samples. The increase in frequency of intercourse between
the 1965 and 1970 NFS has been previously
reported by Westoff (1974). In the under-25
age group the increase was 2.46. In the
25-34 age group the Increase was 2.06,
while in the over-35 age group the increase
was only 0.43. Intercourse rates therefore
decline with age more sharply in the latest
than in the earliest sample. But this increase
in the decline is reflected in an increase in the
unstandardized regression coefficient for
female age only, not for male age.

The 1974 sample has disproportionately
fewer women in the older age brackets than
did the earlier samples, resulting in a lower
mean age forthesample and aslightly lower
standard deviation of age of woman. But
thedifferences inthe relative powers of male
and female age cannot be explained by
differences in the distributions, because decline in the standard deviation of female age
and increase in the standard deviation of
male age in the latest samples should havea
tendency to produce statistical artifacts in
the direction opposite to that found.

There is a potential problem in the regres
sion of frequency of intercourse against
male and female age in the same model. In
each of these samples, male and female age
are correlated above 0.80, thus raising questions of unstable results through collinearity. The data were therefore examined
through contingency tables, examining the
frequency of intercourse of males of different ages married to females of the same age,
and then reversing the sexes, using five-year
age categories. Categories with fewer than
fifty observations were collapsed where’
possible to create cells with at least fifty
observations. The data are presented in
Table 3.

Table 3 shows the mean decline between
age categories for each sex when the age
category of the other sex is held constant.

The picture revealed is similar to that derived from the multiple regression. In the
1965 NFS, the decline by female age is less
than the decline by male age. In the 1970
NFS, the decline by female age is greater;
and in the 1974 data, the decline by female
age is much greater.!

DISCUSSION

It is important to keep in mind that in
none of these samples are we following the
decline in intercourse over the aging process
of individual couples, nor have any of the
previous studies. Rather, we are observing
differences in intercourse rates of persons of
different ages. Now it is clear from Table 2
that at different time periods persons of the
same age have different intercourserates. In
all but the over-35 category, the age
categories show increases in frequency of
two per month during the interval between
the first and last surveys. The time period of
these studies is clearly a period in which
sexual frequency has increased (Westoff,
1974). We are therefore comparing the coital frequency of groups of different ages
who, at the same ages, were having different experiences. But the entire century has
been experiencing coital rate changes. Kinsey etal. (1953, p. 897) show that the median
frequency of intercourse for women at similar ages declined for the first four decadeof-birth cohorts of the twentieth century.
During any long period when the rate of
intercourse for persons of a given age is
changing, the relationship between age and
frequency of intercourse will be different at
different time cross-sections within that
period. Likewise, the lifetime pattern of
decline with age for any birth cohort will be
different from that of any other birth cohort.
There is no obvious reason why these secu
1 The declines observed by James (1974) in his
analysis of the 1965 NFS data show about the same
figure for males, but a smaller one for females, evidently because he added subcontingency controls for
parity and social class and because he excluded couples

in which either spouse was over 45. In the present
analysis, only the women are cut at age 45.

Age and Marital Intercourse

133

lar trends in the frequency of intercourse
shoulddirectly affect changes in the relative
contribution of male and female age.

It is possible to interpret the data presented in this paper as reflecting primarily
cohort changes in sexual socialization of
women. Each younger cohort may be imagined to be socialized to be more sexually
motivated than the previous cohort. Sexual
motivation would therefore be closely related to cohort. The last study therefore
would contain the most sexually motivated young women, which would produce the biggest gap between the motivation of women of different ages. If there
were at the same time essentially no

‘changes between cohorts of men, then

each later sample would increase the
strength of the effect of women’s age,
without a corresponding change in the effect of aging for men.

However, itis worth noting that increases
in coital frequency occurred at every age
level between 1965 and 1970 (Westoff,
1974). Whatever we mean by “socialization” will therefore have to be assumed to be
going on throughout the reproductive years
rather than limited to childhood and youth;
but it simply has less effect after 35 years of
age.

An alternate possible explanation is that
the progressively greater explanatory
power of female agereflects asecular change
in the nature of the sexual relationship. It
might be hypothesized that the general
equalization of the power balance between
the sexes, or perhaps an increasing sensitivity of males to intrinsic female sexual interest may make the occurrence of intercourse increasingly responsive to variations
in women’s sexual predispositions. This
explanation is consistent with the studies
showing a sharp decline in female sexual
interest with age. However, these studies
are also interpretable as cohort variations in
sexual interest levels among women.

The similarity between human and in

134

frahuman species in the decline in sexual
frequency with age suggests underlying
biological factors. The fact that the decline
begins many years before hormonal changes
suggests that those biological factors are not
hormonal in the age group examined in this
analysis. The cohort changes in sexual frequency at specific ages observed in the
present analysis and the increase in strength
of relationship to female age in later samples
indicate that sociological factors yet unidentified must also play a part in creating the
pattern.

While we think it is clear that there are
biological factors implicated in the declining frequency from an early age, we also
think that the discussion in terms of declining capacity has obscured the issues. Even if
there is a decline in capacity for either or
both sexes, the actual frequency of marital
intercourse has nothing to do with the decline in capacity. The reason is that for the
vast bulk of the population actual frequency
never approaches physical capacity. An
examination of the rates in Figure 1 will
make this clear. In the Kinsey data, half the
couples in which the husbands are age 26 to
30 had intercourse less than twice a week,
and half the couples in which husbands are
age 46 to 5O0had intercourse less than oncea
week. Surely no one believes that this is the
measure of physical capacity for males of
these ages, not to mention females.

sents an accommodation of the inherent
sexual interest levels of amale and female. If
the two studies described by Eysenck are
taken to measure what happens to inherent
sexual interest levels of the two sexes with
age, the accommodation must encompass
two increasingly discrepant inherent interest levels. We leave open the question of
why the female interest level shows such a
dramatic decline. This accommodation no
doubt will eventually be explained in terms
of social processes.

SUMMARY

We have examined the role of male and
female age in determining the frequency of
marital intercourse in three recent samples
of Americans. We find no support for the
widely held view that male but not female
age causes the well-known decline in frequency of marital intercourse. For our samples, examining only couples in which the
woman is under 45, male and female age
contribute independently to the decline. In
the earliest sample, each sex contributes
about equally to the decline. In the latest
sample, female age is far more important
than male age. These declines are probably
underwritten by a biological aging process,
but they are not caused by declines in sex
hormones. Sociological processes interact
with biological processes to produce the
observed patterns.
