Selection Intensities and Inbreeding Among
Some Caste Groups of Andhra Pradesh, India

ABSTRACT: An attempt is made to study the interaction of inbreeding levels with other factors in
influencing the intensity of natural selection. Results suggest that selection intensity values are
high in the inbred and low socioeconomic groups of Madiga and Mala (1.545, 0.687). On the
other hand, the non-inbred and high socioeconomic group of Maheshwari shows low selection
intensity (0.543). Contribution of mortality to total index of selection is greater in the groups of
Madiga and Mala (1.059, 1.062) than in the Maheshwari group (0.204).

Since Crow (1958) introduced the total index of opportunity for natural selection, several populations have been
studied to find the evidence that socioeconomic and cultural levels play an important role in the relative contribution
of the mortality and fertility components to the total index of selection
(Spuhler 1962; Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer 1971). Studies on the Indian rural
and tribal populations (Murty and Ramesh, 1978; Barua, 1976; Talukdar, 1977;
Chengal Reddy and Lakshmanudu,
1979), which are generally characterized
by poor nutrition, higher incidence of
disease, and large family size, have supported this observation. Apart from
these socioeconomic and cultural factors, large scale inbreeding is another
factor characterizing South Indian populations and particularly that of Andhra
Pradesh.

However, it is not known precisely to
what extent this inbreeding interacts
with other factors in influencing the intensity of natural selection.

Inbreeding in general is found to affect mortality to a greater extent and fertility only to a smaller extent (Cavalli
 

Sforza et al., 1971). Recent studies of
Sunder Rao et al. (1977) in Tamil Nadu
have indicated that in highly inbred
groups such as those of South India the
effects of long-standing inbreeding are
negligible both on mortality and fertility
factors.

Since probability of death (P,) increases under inbreeding and probability of survival (P,) decreases, one expects a very significant increase in the
index of selection due to mortality (I,,)
with inbreeding. On the other hand the
effects of inbreeding on mean and variance (X, V,) of the number of live births
were found to vary in different populations (Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1971; Schull,
Komatsu, Nagano, and Yamamoto,
1968) so that the influence of inbreeding
on the index of selection due to fertility
(I;) is likely to vary among different populations.

We have therefore made an attempt
to examine empirically the effects of inbreeding on the intensities of selection,
by comparison of the indices in some select populations chosen for their differences in socioeconomic level, food
habits, and levels of inbreeding.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Reproductive histories and family
pedigrees of the probands consisting of
three to five previous generations were
obtained on families of four Teluguspeaking rural caste groups of Mahabubnagar District—Madiga, Mala, Reddy, Vysya—and of the Hindi-speaking
Maheshwari caste group of the city of
Hyderabad. The family studies were

made through household visits conSducted i in the period from October 1980
‘gto February 1982. Information on the soiocultural characteristics along with
esample sizes studied and inbreeding levGels are summarized in Table 1. The low
&sample size of the Mala group was only
Gdue to their low number in the villages
surveyed.
% The Maheshwari group has been in‘gtluded as it is one of the very few groups
available in Andhra Pradesh without
-Lany inbreeding. Maheshwaris also differ
from the other groups in the following
Crespects: (1) They are immigrants from
‘FRajasthan (North India), whereas all
Othe others are South Indian in origin.
‘—They migrated to Hyderabad approximately 150 years ago and have had no
‘marital contact with the local inhabitgants thus far. (2) They are divided into
280 exclusively exogamous clans. No con

sanguinity is permitted in this group,
and they have specified traditions of
matrimony (Darak, 1967).

RESULTS

From the demographic variables presented in Table 2, one could visualize a
strong influence of economic status on
the mean number of deaths from low
values in the three groups, viz., Reddy,
Vysya, and Maheshwari compared to
higher values in Madiga and Mala (approx. 3.00). Two-way analysis of variance followed by F-test was applied to
see the effect of socioeconomic status
and inbreeding on mean number of
deaths. It is observed that the effect of
socioeconomic status (i.e., caste group
differences) is significant (Fy, =
35.09959), whereas the effect of inbreeding (i.e., consanguineous and nonconsanguineous subgroup differences)
is not significant (F; 4=0.0085). However, there is a marginal increase in the
mean number of deaths in consanguineous groups of Mala, Reddy, and Vysya
as compared to their respective nonconSanguineous groups. The mean number
of deaths among liveborn (2.59) per
woman is somewhat lower in the Mala
group as compared to its socioeconomi

cally equivalent group, the Madiga
(3.27). This is probably a result of the
low sample size (n=20) of Mala. The
same might explain the low mean number of live births in the Mala women. Effects of socioeconomic status and inbreeding are insignificant on the mean
number of live births, (F44= 1.3195 and
F, 4= 0.3972 respectively).

Total index of selection, index of selection due to mortality, and index of selection due to fertility values of these
groups are presented in Table 4. Both
the mortality and fertility components
of selection intensity are the highest in
the Madiga (1.157, 0.505), and they are
the lowest in the Maheshwari (0.204,

differences between consanguineous
and nonconsanguineous subgroups are
not uniform. Broadly, the fertility components of selection intensity are lower
in consanguineous subgroups than in the
nonconsanguineous subgroups of three
castes, viz., Mala, Reddy and Vysya,
but there are no apparent differences in
the mortality component.

In the Madiga caste group, however,
the fertility component is lower in the
nonconsanguineous subgroup whereas
the mortality component ts lower in the
consanguineous subgroup. This exception is difficult to explain.

Probably the sample sizes in the subgroups are not large enough to provide
satisfactory results. In this context, the
large differences in average inbreeding
coefficients of each of the four groups
presented in Table 1 and 2 are noteworthy. These differences can be explained
only from the differences in sample
sizes, Comparisons with the estimates of
intensity of selection from previous
studies (Table 5) also broadly agree in
respect to this positive interaction of inbreeding and socioeconomic levels on

selection intensity (J). The total selection indices are generally high in tribes
and low socioeconomic groups characterized by higher inbreeding levels compared to urban and high socioeconomic
groups with low inbreeding levels. The
large variation in respect to per cent
contribution of J;/P, component to the
total index seen in some studies may be
due to methodological biases in the collection of information on progeny mortality and progeny survival.

Thus, in conclusion, while the intergroup comparisons among the five
groups of the present study indicate
strong positive interaction between socioeconomic levels and inbreeding levels in that the highly inbred low socioeconomic Madiga is at one extreme with
a high intensity of selection characterized by a high mortality component.
The non-inbred high socioeconomic
Maheshwari is at another extreme characterized by the least intensity of selection and high contribution of fertility
component. It appears necessary to find
theoretical justification for the results
observed. More intense and careful field
