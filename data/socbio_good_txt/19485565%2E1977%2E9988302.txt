ABSTRACT, A survey of 1,155 girls aged 10 through 20 was conducted in a rural area of
Bangladesh in March, 1976, to assess the impact of nutritional status on the onset of menarche
and the association between age at menarche and age at marriage. In recent years there has been
an increased age at onset of menarche which appears to have been associated with malnutrition
caused by war, postwar inflation, floods, and famine in the period 1971-76. Body weight was
highly correlated with the age of onset of menarche. A seasonal trend in onset of menarche was
noted with the peak occurring in the winter months corresponding to the largest annual rice
harvest. An increased age of marriage was also noted, which may be correlated with the increased

 

age of menarche.

The age of menarche in developed countries has declined in the last hundred
years. This decline has been attributed to
improved diets, lowered rates of infection,
and improved environmental and sanitary
conditions (Tanner, 1968; Cagas and
Riley, 1970). Numerous studies in both
technologically advanced and developing
countries have focused on the variables
affecting the onset of menarche. None of
these studies, however, has examined
menarche in relation to worsening external
conditions and the effect adverse changes
can have on the onset of menarche.

Bangladesh offers an unique opportunity for the study of such a situation because since independence (1971), the socloeconomic condition of the country has
declined. For the past five years, there has
generally been a decreasing per capita dietary intake. Chen and Chaudhury (1975)
estimated that the per capita intake of
calories declined from 1,715 in 1960-65 to
1,680 in 1965-70 and 1,618 in 1970-74;
and the average per capita protein intake
declined from 43.4 g in 1960-65 to 42.5 g

in 1965-70 and 40.6 g in 1970-74. The
quality of protein consumed has also declined during this period.

Using FAO/WHO standards, adjusting
for body weight, climate, activity, and
making allowances for lactation and pregnancy, Chen (1975) calculated that the
minimal per capita consumption necessary
for health is 1,600 calories and 40 g protein. These calculations illustrate that if
available food were distributed among the
population according to need, each person
would have only the minimum requirement. However, as was shown in the National Nutritional Survey of 1962-64,
more than half of the rural population
consumed less than their calorie and protein requirements (U.S. Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare, 1966,
pp. 232-243). This study was conducted
more than ten years ago when more food
per capita was available. It is probable
that due to the worsening economic conditions, the disparity in distribution is
even greater at present, with an even
larger proportion of the rural poor con

suming levels of food lower than the minimum standards.

Environmental conditions have not improved for the most part since independence. The prevalence of infection and
disease has resulted in mortality rates similar to those observed a decade ago. There
have been fluctuating increases in the mortality rate noted in 1971-72 and 1974-75,
in the first case due to the famine caused
by the war and in the second due to famine
caused by flooding and subsequent crop
failure (Curlin et al., 1976; Chowdhury et
al., 1977). These two severe crises led to
increases in the crude death rate of almost
40 per cent. An especially relevant statistic is that mortality among the female age
group 5-9 years increased by 100 per cent
during both crises. This figure represents
only the easily quantified extent of the
damage caused. The effect on morbidity
and growth of children can only be estimated. Whether the onset of menarche has
also been affected is of interest because of
its correlation to nutritional status.

The relationship of nutritional status
with menarche has been postulated by
many, though its effects are still not
clearly understood. Tanner reviewed the
literature on earlier maturation and noted
the extent of the role nutrition plays. In
countries where the age of onset of
menarche has decreased in the last hundred years by 2.5-3.5 years (Norway,
Germany, Sweden, etc.), there has been
an increasing trend in height and weight,
with children now averaging one year
younger for the same height and weight
than was observed thirty to forty years
ago. (Tanner, 1968). In Britain during the
past century, the age of menarche has fallen nearly four months per decade
(Trowell, 1975).

In Denmark during the middle of the
nineteenth century, the mean age of
menarche was reported as 16.3 and 17.4
years (Ravn, 1850; Hannover, 1865, as

 

 

Menarche in Bangladesh

317

reported by Bojlen and Bentzon, 1968).
Norway, England, and Poland experienced mean ages of menarche during the
early 1900’s of 15-16 years (Bojlen and
Bentzon, 1968; Tanner and O’Keefe,
1962). This decreasing trend in age of
menarche has also been observed in the
U.S. by Engle and Shelesnyak (1934) who
reported a mean age of menarche of 13-14
in 1934-40 and by Reed and Stuart (1950)
who reported an average age of menarche
in 1947 of 12.8. The present age of
menarche in the United States is estimated
at 12 to 13 years (Zacharias et al., 1976).

This trend of declining age of onset of
menarche has not been observed in impoverished nations where nutritional
status has remained inadequate due to unfavorable socioeconomic — conditions.
Madhavan (1965) estimated the mean age
of menarche in urban and rural areas of
India at 12.76 years (urban) and 14.16
years (rural) in Madras; and 13.24 (urban)
and 14.42 (rural) in Kerala. Since socioeconomic conditions are usually better in
urban areas, a discrepancy such as this
one often occurs in developing countries.
In an urban area of Lucknow, India, the
mean age of menarche was reported as
14.1 years (Koshi et al., 1970). Foll studied
girls in Assam, India, and Burma and reported an average age of menarche of
13.21 and 13.25, respectively (Foll, 1961).
Burrell et al. reported an average age of
menarche for South African Bantus of
15.02 for those classified as “not poor” and
15.42 for those classified as “poor” (Burrell
et al., 1961).

The suggestion that differences in nutritional status have been responsible for
the lowering of the age of menarche is
supported by several studies which examined nutritional status in relation to
menarche status. A recent study of Indian
girls in Uttar Pradesh reported that girls of
better nutritional status who received diets
higher in calories and protein showed ear

lier menarche (Bhalla and Srivastava,
1974). Kralji-Cercek (1956) found that
Slovian girls with diets rich in protein
reached menarche 1.55 years earlier than
those with diets composed mostly of carbohydrates (12.65 years compared to 14.1
years). Hillman et al. (1971) obtained data
on 2,992 U.S. women aged 18-25 years
and reported a high correlation between
present nutritional status and age of
menarche. In a ten-year prospective study
of sexual development in American girls
age 8-10, Zacharias et al. (1976) related
onset of menarche to body build. They
reported a significant positive correlation
between the ponderal index, a function of
height and weight, and age of menarche.
It is suggested that a girl’s age of menarche
is more closely associated to her shape
than to her size; late menarche is associated with thinness and early menarche
with heaviness. Dreizen et al. (1967) observed in a U.S. study that well-nourished
girls had an average age of menarche of
12.43, compared to 14.45 among poorly
nourished girls.

Few of the above investigations have
attempted to explain how nutritional
status relates to onset of menarche. Frisch
has developed a method of estimating a
minimal weight for height necessary for
the onset of menarche (Frisch, 1972;
Frisch and McArthur, 1974; Frisch,
1976). She hypothesizes that menarche is
determined by a critical body composition
of fat as a percentage of body weight.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This paper was prepared utilizing the
initial interview data from a prospective
study on onset of menarche conducted by
the Cholera Research Laboratory (CRL) in
Matlab, Bangladesh. Since 1966, the CRL
has been maintaining a registration system
of births, deaths, and migrations among
the 112,000 residents in 132 villages of

Social Biology

Matlab. Apart from these registration activities, censuses were conducted in 1970
and 1974 to update the registration information. An additional 101 villages were
added to the registration system in 1968.
However, in order to provide greater accuracy in determination of the ages of the
study subjects, we confined this study to
the 1966 census population.

The 1974 census data for the 132 villages was used as the sampling frame for
this study. The study was designed to
interview over a thousand girls aged 10 to
20 years, irrespective of their marital
status. A purposeful pick of 13 villages
was chosen to provide a larger proportion
of Hindus than normally found in this
population. A list was prepared of girls
aged 8-18 in the 1974 census residing in 13
villages. The initial survey conducted in
March, 1976, obtained information on
1,155 girls whose ages at the time of the
study were 10-20 years.

At the initial interview, retrospective information on marital and menarcheal
status and age and date of onset of
menarche was obtained by local female
field assistants. Height (cm), weight (kg),
and arm circumference (cm) were measured at the girls’ homes. These interviews
are being repeated at monthly intervals for
girls who have not reached menarche in
order to provide prospective data on the
relationship of nutritional status to the
onset of menarche.

The ages of the girls in this study born
in 1966 were calculated from the dates of
birth given on the birth registration forms.
For all other subjects, ages were determined by adjusting upwards the ages
given in the 1966 census. At the time of the
1966 census, parents were asked the age of
their children. In order to check the accuracy of these reported ages, the parents
were also asked the intervals between successive children. By adding the consecutive intervals to the age of the youngest

infant in the family, ages of older children
could be verified. Girls who were reported
to be 2 years old in 1966 were listed as
being 12 years old in 1976. Reported ages
represent the age at the last birthday and
thus represent total completed years.
The following points reflect the extent of
bias in the study population with respect
to age. Girls who were born in 1966 have
little chance of being misclassified by overreporting of their ages because their dates
of births were registered. The probability
of having subjects younger than ten years
in our study thus is minimal. In the 1966
census, girls who were aged 0-4 (who now
are aged 10-14) may have been underenumerated, an occurrence observed in the
national census and in other surveys of
Bangladesh because of social factors related to the low status of girl children
(Muniruzzaman, 1966). However, there is
little likelihood of excessive under- or
overreporting of their ages. Ages of girls
reported as 5-10 in 1966 (now ages 15-20)
may be biased since unmarried females of
the 10-14 year age group in 1966 might
have underreported their ages because of
the social stigma associated with being
unmarried and thus have been misclassified in the 5~9 age group. Some of the
girls now classified as ages 15-20 may in
fact be older than their estimated ages.
Data on menarcheal status is based on
both cross-sectional reporting of whether
the girl had begun menstruating by the
time of the interview and retrospective information on when menses first began for
those who had reached menarche. In order
to determine the age at onset of menarche,
we asked subjects the length of time prior
to the interview they had begun menstruating. This interval was then subtracted from their present age to calculate
age of menarche. This age is measured in
completed years and represents any age
between two consecutive years. That is, a
girl whose age at menarche is given as 10

Bangladesh 319
could have begun menstruating anytime
between 10 and 11 years of age.

RESULTS

Information on both status-quo and
retrospective data are used in the analysis
of this paper. Table 1 shows the distrnibution of girls by age, religion, and percentage attaining menarche. Few have attained menarche by age 13, and only
one-fifth of girls aged 14 have reached
menarche. When classified by religion,
both Muslims and Hindus show similar
patterns with respect to their menstrual
status by age. The derived median age of
menarche calculated from this table is 15.8
for Muslims and 16.0 for Hindus. Median
age here is expressed as the point at which
SO per cent of the girls have started
menstruating (X:F(x) = 0.5).

In order to obtain an estimated mean of
age of menarche, probit analysis was also
used (Finney, 1964). This analytical technique is appropriate since the data approximate a normal distribution, conforming
to the conditions for use of probit. The
mean age of menarche using this technique is estimated at 15.65 for Muslims

320

and 15.91 for Hindus. The probit regression equations were:

Y,= 5.65 + 0.67 X, (Muslim);
Y, = 5.83 + 0.68 X, (Hindu).

II

These equations illustrate that Muslims
and Hindus have similar coefficients and
near equal ages of menarche.

Table 2 shows the distribution of girls
by age, body weight, and percentage who
have reached menarche. This table clearly
reflects that both age and weight are related to the proportion reaching menarche. When age is controlled for, the prominent effect of weight on menstrual status
is evident. When weight is controlled for,
the relationship of age is less striking,
though still positively correlated to
menstrual status. Overall, 98 per cent of
the girls whose weights were 40 kg (88
lbs.) or greater had reached menarche,
compared to only 1 per cent of those
weighing less than 30 kg (66 lbs.).

Table 3 illustrates the mean weights and
heights for girls by menarche status. At

years. When body weight is controlled for,
height shows little relationship to the proportion reaching menarche. However,
when height is controlled for, weight
shows a significant relationship to the per
cent of girls attaining menarche. Again,
body weight seems to be one of the most
important factors for the determination of
onset of menarche.

A seasonal pattern of onset of menarche
was observed in this study. Of the girls
who attained menarche, 49.4 per cent reported doing so in the months of November through February, whereas only 19.3
per cent attained menarche in the months
May through August. The months of November through February encompass the

Menarche in Bangladesh

321

winter season when food prices are low
and staples such as rice are abundantly
available in Bangladesh (Chen et al.,
1974). It is possible that the nutritional
status of the population improves at
this time, leading to increases in body
weight necessary for the initiation of
menarche.

Table 5 presents the cumulative per
cent distribution of girls who attained
menarche by their year of birth and age of
onset of menarche. This table illustrates
that those who were born in 1960 or earlier
have a different distribution of onset of
menarche than the cohort born after 1960.
Those who were born after 1960 exhibit a
cumulative distribution of onset of menarche parallel to their older cohort, though
shifted later by at least one year. The
average age of menarche for the cohort
born in 1961 or later will be at least one
year older than the previous cohort if this
pattern continues. This younger group
(1961-66 cohort) was 5-10 years old when
they experienced the famine of 1971-72
and 8-13 years old when they were subsequently confronted by another severe
famine in 1974-75. During 1971-75,
Bangladesh faced war, postwar inflation,
floods, and famines which resulted in economic crises for the country. These events

may have helped to produce a deterioration in the nutritional status of these girls
who were just approaching puberty. More
than half of the cohort of girls born before
1960 had already attained menarche by
1971, and thus for them the effect of a
deterioration of nutritional status would
not be evidenced by the later onset of
menarche. Other biological parameters,
such as regularity of cycles, however, may
have been negatively affected.

Earlier studies in Matlab reported the
average age of marriage as 12.9 in 1961
and 15.9 in 1968 (Aziz et al., 1970). Information obtained in this research illustrated a median age of marriage of 17.4
years for Muslims and 18.6 years for Hindus. By age 20, nearly 80 per cent of the
Muslims and over 70 per cent of the Hindus had been married.

These data suggest that there has been
an upward trend in the median age of
marriage in Matlab since 1961. It is also
evident that the median age of marriage
for Muslims is 1.5 years higher and for
Hindus 2.5 years higher than their respective median ages of menarche.

Table 6 illustrates the relationship of
marriage with menarche, controlling for
age. It indicates that the proportion of
ever-married girls is much higher among

Chowdhury et al.

Social Biology

those who have attained menarche than
among those who have not. For menarcheal girls, the proportion ever married
increases as age increases, a phenomenon
true for both Muslims and Hindus. However, for nonmenarcheal girls, the proportion ever married is low for all age groups
and shows only a slight increase as age
increases. None of the premenarcheal
Hindu girls are married, regardless of age.
This fact suggests that onset of menarche
is a determining variable in the custom of
marriage, both for Muslims and Hindus.

DISCUSSION ON BIASES

The age bias has been referred to earlier. The use of the ages given in the 1966
census, adjusted by adding ten years to
determine present ages, has probably prevented a large degree of age bias for girls
presently aged 10-14. However, girls who
were aged 10-14 in 1966 may have been
reported as 5-9 because they were premenarcheal, and thus appeared immature,
or because they were unmarried. Thus,
the present age group 15-19 may contain
some girls of this type who in fact are
older. The single-year age distribution
shown in Table 1 apparently reflects little
of this type of bias.

Another bias that may be affecting the
data is that of outmigration. Girls of earlier menarche are more likely to migrate
out of the villages due to marriage, and
thus our sample may contain a disproportionate number of girls who are premenarcheal. However, during 1974-76,
26 girls moved out of the study villages, to
marry and 30 migrated in because of marriage.

The most significant bias that may be
affecting the data is that of unmarried girls
not admitting to having reached menarche. Viewing such problems before hand,
the researchers developed an interview
technique to check hesitant or negative
responses. In cases where respondents refused to answer or hesitantly answered
“No” or “I don’t know” when questioned
about menstrual status, such responses
were checked by asking mothers, grandmothers, or friends of the respondent. Because of the close contact and lack of privacy experienced by villagers, other family members are likely to know whether a
girl has reached menarche.

In order to estimate the extent to which
this third type of bias is operating, we
assumed that all girls age 18 should have
reached menarche. All 46 married girls
aged 18 had menstruated. Out of 39 unmarried girls aged 18, six reported not
having menstruated. Assuming these six
girls gave incorrect responses, the maximum estimate of incorrect response is 15
per cent (6/39).

Body weights for these six nonmenstruating girls range from 26.9 kg
(59.2 lbs.) to 34.9 kg (76.8 lbs.), while the
mean body weight of menarcheal girls
aged 18 is 42.7 kg (Sp 5.3). Weights and
heights of the six nonmenstruating subjects are: Subject 1, 35.50 kg (78.1 lbs.),
144.8 cm (57.Qinches); Subject 2, 30.75 kg
(67.7 lbs.), 145.7 cm (57.4 inches); Subject
3, 34.87 kg (76.7 lbs.), 143.6 cm (56.5
inches); Subject 4, 28.60 kg (62.9 Ibs.),

140.9 cm (55.5 inches); Subject 5, 27.50 kg
(60.5 lbs.), 136.4 cm (53.7 inches); and
Subject 6, 26.94 kg (59.3 lbs.), 137.0 cm
(53.9 inches). The weights of four of these
nonmenstruating girls were below two
standard deviations of the mean. Thus,
according to their weight classification,
they would not be likely to have reached
menarche.

Frisch and McArthur (1974) have proposed a method of estimating minimal percentage body weight as fat (17 per cent) for
onset of menarche to occur. This standard
is based on studies conducted in Caucasian women, and it is unknown whether it
applies to other populations. It is interesting that our findings are consistent with
the minimal weight for height noted for
the U.S. women in Frisch’s study, since
only one of the six girls qualifies for
menarche according to Frisch’s criterion.

We estimate the extent of bias for unmarried menarcheal females who respond
incorrectly to range from 1/39 (2.6 per
cent) using Frisch’s method, to 2/39 (5.1
per cent) based on the standard deviation,
or to 6/39 (15.4 per cent), the maximum.
The median age of menarche resulting
from the maximum bias would be 15.7,
only slightly less than the median age of
15.9 observed for the total sample.

The use of retrospective data offers another bias that could significantly affect
conclusions made about the increasing age
of menarche. If older girls are consistently
more likely to give a younger age of menarche than they actually experienced, the
difference noted among girls above and
below age 15 would be lessened. We are
unable to estimate the extent of this bias.
However, other researchers have studied
this problem with encouraging results.
Damon et al. (1969) found no significant
difference between recalled age of
menarche (after 19 years) to that observed,
though there was a trend of stating earlier
menarche as later and later menarche as

324

earlier. In a similar study, Damon and
Bajema (1971) reported that the age of
menarche was recalled after 39 years to be
two years earlier than the actual event.
However, they conclude that recalled age
of menarche is accurate enough for epidemiological purposes. It is interesting to
note among South African Bantus, Kark
(1943) observed that older girls reported a
later age of menarche than younger girls.
She suggests this difference was due to
inaccuracy of recall. If this were the case
in our sample, the older girls would have
begun menses even earlier than reported.

CONCLUSIONS

1. In recent years in a rural area of
Bangladesh, the age of onset of menarche
has increased.

2. This increase seems to be associated
with malnutrition caused by the war,
postwar inflation, floods, and famines during the period 1971-75.

3. Body weight 1s one of the most important factors associated with age of
onset of menarche.

4. There exists a seasonality of onset of
menarche with a peak in winter.

Social Biology

5. Age of marriage among this rural
population has increased and may be
associated with the increasing age of
menarche.

6. Since both age of menarche and age
of marriage have increased, it may be expected that fertility among females age
15-19 will decrease in the future if this
pattern continues.
