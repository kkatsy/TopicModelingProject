Age Heaping in Recent National

Censuses

It has been fairly well established that
census age statistics are often characterized
by a number of deficiencies, the most common of which is a pronounced tendency for
persons to “round-off” to certain preferred
digits when reporting numerical data such
as age or year of birth (Turner, 1958;
Stockwell, 1966). This tendency leads to a
marked pattern of “heaping” throughout
an age distribution wherein there is an obvious overrepresentation of persons with
ages or birth years ending in the preferred
digits (0, 5, and to a lesser extent 8), and
an equally obvious underrepresentation of
ages or birth years ending in the remaining
digits (especially 9 and 1). Using data presented in Table 7 of the 1971 Demographic
Yearbook of the United Nations, the present brief note examines the extent and pattern of digit preference/avoidance in some
recent (post-1965) national population censuses.

MEASURING DIGIT PREFERENCE
AND AVOIDANCE

The technique selected to measure the
extent of digit preference/avoidance in age

reporting is the “blending” method described by Robert J. Myers (1940). A
number of alternative measures for evaluating single year of age data were available, but were rejected for various reasons.
Whipple’s Index of Concentration, for example, tends to overstate the preference for
ages ending in “0” because the effect of
mortality in an “unblended” population
would normally result in more people at
ages ending in “0” than in the higher order
digits (Shryock and Siegel, 1971, p. 206).
Other summary indexes of digit preference,
e.g., the Bachi index, the Carrier index, and
the Ramachandran index, may have some
slight theoretical advantages over the Myers
index; but they are more laborious to compute and they differ little from Myers’ in
indicating the general extent of age heaping
(Shryock and Siegel, 1971, p. 208).

Very briefly, the Myers technique derives a “blended” population which is essentially a weighted sum of the number of
persons reporting ages ending in each of the
ten terminal digits. The underlying assumption of this method is that if there are no
systematic irregularities in the reporting

164

of age, the “blended” sum at each terminal
digit should be approximately equal to 10
per cent of the total “blended” population.
If the sum at any given digit exceeds 10
per cent of the total “blended” population,
it indicates overselection of ages ending in
that digit (digit preference). Conversely, a
negative deviation (or a sum that is less
than 10 per cent of the “blended” total)
indicates underselection of ages ending in
that digit (digit avoidance). An overall
measure of the extent to which there is
digit preference and/or avoidance in a census age distribution is the Index of Preference, which is obtained as one-half of
the absolute sum of the deviations for each
of the ten terminal digits.

Using data recently published by the
United Nations (1972), an Index of Preference was computed for each of 64 countries (all those having single-year-of-age
data for the age range 10-79 years). An
examination of the resulting data suggested
that an index value of 3.0 would be a reasonable cut-off point to separate out countries whose statistics may be regarded as
generally accurate and relatively free from
bias (i.e., none of the more highly advanced
nations of Europe, North America, and
Oceania had index values as high as 3.0).
Those countries having Index of Preference
values below 3.0 are as follows:

Index of Preference less than 1.0—Australia, 1970; Denmark, 1969; England and
Wales, 1966; Finland, 1969; Iceland,
1970; Isle of Man, 1971; Luxembourg,
1970; Netherlands, 1970; New Zealand,
1969; Northern Ireland, 1966; Norway,
1970; Poland, 1970; Scotland, 1966;
Sweden, 1970; Switzerland, 1970; United
States, 1970.

The remaining countries and their Index
of Preference values, which ranged from
just under 4 (Brunei and Fiji) to a high of
35.9 for Zanzibar, are presented in Table 1.
If it can be assumed that the extent of age
heaping is an indication of the overall accuracy of official census statistics, it is clear
from these data that serious inadequacies
may be found in many of the recent cen

THE PATTERN OF DIGIT
PREFERENCE

Based on previous research, the expected
pattern of digit preference and avoidance
should reflect the tendency “to overreport
digits which are multiples of the divisors
of the base of the number system and underreport digits which are not multiples of
the base of the number system” (Turner,
1958, p. 248). Since the base-ten system
common to all post-primitive peoples has
10, 5, and 2 as divisors, preference should
attach to ages ending in multiples of these
numbers. Furthermore, it has been suggested more specifically by Turner (1958)
and verified by Stockwell (1966) that
greatest preference should be shown to ages
divisible by the base itself (i.e., ages ending
in zero), whereas ages not divisible by 10
but divisible by 5 should rank second.

Overreporting should also characterize
ages divisible by neither 10 nor 5 but divisible by 2. Ages ending in 2 or 8 should be
selected more than those ending in 4 or 6
because the latter two flank the more preferred digit 5. Major avoidance should
characterize ages ending in 1, 3, 7, or 9
(i.e., those digits that are not multiples of
the divisors of the base of the number system), with avoidance being especially pronounced for ages ending in 1 or 9, those
numbers that flank the most highly preferred zero.

Thus, the following rank order of digit
preference/avoidance would be expected to
occur:

O (most preferred)

5
2,8
4,6
3,7
1,9

?
?
3

(most avoided)

Age Heaping in Censuses

Although there are a few exceptions, discussed below, the general pattern depicted
in Table 2 conforms reasonably well to our
expectations. A casual examination of this
table clearly reveals that ages ending in 0
are selected far more often than ages ending in 5, the second most preferred digit.
Among the remaining digits only 8 exhibits
a majority of positive deviations; and the
general pattern of underselection characterizing the other seven digits is clearly most
pronounced for ages ending in 1.

Exceptions that prove the rule—The
most glaring exceptions to the expected
pattern (e.g., the heaping at ages ending
in 1 in Brunei; at ages ending in 8 in Gilbert and Ellice Islands; at ages ending in 7
and O in French Guiana; at ages ending in
9 in Southern Rhodesia and Zambia; and
the greatest overselection of digit 5 rather
than 0 in Iraq), actually represent additional confirmation of expectations. That
is, they exhibit the expected pattern of
heaping, but in relation to year of birth
rather than attained age.

To illustrate, the marked preference for
ages ending in digit 9 in Southern Rhodesia
reflects heaping at years ending in 0 in response to a question on date of birth. This
particular census was taken in June, 1969,
and census age was determined simply as
the difference between year of birth and
year of the census, irrespective of exact
date of birth. This distortion is most
clearly evident at the youngest ages where
the conversion of infants to one year of
age, even though a particular infant might
not have completed one month of life,
results in a pronounced deficit in the under
one year age group relative to succeeding
categories (United Nations, 1972, p. 8).
Among Southern Rhodesian Africans in
1969, for example, there were only 71,210
reported as under one year of age in contrast to 215,530 reported at age one
(United Nations, 1972, p. 173).

data presented in Table 7 of the 1971 Demographic Yearbook of the United Nations.

CONCLUSIONS

To conclude with a generalization, it is
clear that the phenomenon of heaping at
preferred digits continues to be a major
characteristic of the age statistics of nonWestern countries. It is also apparent that
the pattern of age heaping that emerges
can be explained quite readily in terms of
the base of the existing system of counting.
Finally, to the extent that the magnitude
of digit preference/avoidance may be an
indication of the overall accuracy of official
census statistics, it is clear from the data

To take one other illustration, consider
the case of Iraq where a 1965 census is
characterized by pronounced heaping at
ages ending first in 5 and then 0. Here we
have a situation: (a) where a definite response was given to a question asking for
date of birth, and where overselection of
years ending in 0 resulted in heaping at
digit 5; or (6) where a “Don’t know” response to date of birth was followed up by
a question on attained age, thus leading to
pronounced heaping at ages ending in 0.
Similar explanations would account for the
pronounced heaping at ages ending in 7

and 0 in the 1957 Iraq census (United Nations, 1964, p. 670), and in the 1967 census
of French Guiana and the 1969 census of
Zambia considered here in Table 2.

presented here that serious inadequacies
may be found in many of the recent censuses of the non-Western world, especially
those in Africa and the Middle East.
