IUCD Acceptors in Trivandrum,

Kerala, South India

Trivandrum, South India

The development and acceptance of the
intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD)
as one of the several methods of birth control are important landmarks in the history
of family planning. This device is considered as an effective, safe, and suitable one
both for the spacing of children and for
preventing births. On the basis of studies
for two years on some 3,500 women, the
Indian Council of Medical Research recommended the use of the IUCD as a method
of birth control in India, and the Government of India decided to provide facilities
for IUCD insertion in the hospitals and
primary health centers all over the country
beginning in June, 1965.

In Kerala, the most densely populated
state in India, where the need for population control is all the more great, facilities
for IUCD insertion were provided in the
hospitals and dispensaries beginning in
July, 1965. By the end of July, 1968, 126,905
loop insertions had been made. The women
who accept the loop are given five rupees
each, and the doctor who inserts the loop
receives two rupees. The promoter gets one
rupee per case.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The present study is based on the details
of IUCD acceptors collected from two
hospitals in the city of Trivandrum, Kerala,
South India. The period covered is from
July, 1965, to March, 1967, There were
1,088 insertions in one hospital and 170 in
the other. Some of the demographic particulars of the IUCD acceptors and the

226

dates of last delivery and last menstruation
are recorded in the prescribed registers in
both the hospitals. However, the nature of
complaints and dates of expulsion, removal,
or reinsertion which are expected to be recorded in the follow-up register on the basis
of inquiries conducted by field workers like
Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMS) are
available only for the 170 cases registered
at the second hospital where regular followup visits are reported to be conducted.

In the present paper, the following will
be studied:

1. Demographic characteristics of women
who have adopted IUCD’s, such as age,
religion, and number of living children at
the time of IUCD insertion.

2. Timing of the IUCD insertion with respect to last delivery and Jast menstrual
period.

3. Rates of expulsions, removals and reinsertions for those cases where data are
available.

RESULTS
AGE DISTRIBUTION OF IUCD ACCEPTORS

Since it is a method of spacing rather
than terminating childbearing, women in
the lower age groups are the ones who should
accept the IUCD. However, age alone does
not decide the stage of childbearing and
older women might also have the loop inserted either for the purpose of spacing or
for the purpose of avoiding future pregnancies until the menopause is attained.

Table 1 gives the age distribution of 1,239
cases, excluding 19 cases for which age was
not furnished. To enable easy comparison,

the distribution of currently married women
15-44 years of age in the state ts also given.

As may be seen, the age group 25-29
years contains the maximum percentage
of women among the IUCD acceptors. The
modal age group was also found to be 25-29
years in the study conducted by the Demographic Training and Research Centre in
Bombay (Asha, 1966) and the Central
Family Planning Institute in Delhi (Murty,
1967). In respect to the extremely low and
high age groups, the percentage of acceptors
is much lower than the corresponding population percentages of married women at
these ages, a feature which is strikingly
similar to that in the analysis of data by
Murty (1967). The proportion of IUCD acceptors in the age group 20-24 years is
more or less the same as the proportion of
currently married women in this age group
in Kerala,

If we consider the age group 20-34 years
as a whole, we find that 80% of the acceptors belong to this group, even though the
corresponding percentage of currently married women in the age group is only 64%.
This concentration of women in the age
groups which are crucial from the point of
view of reproductive behavior is a welcome
sign.

The study conducted by the Institute of
Rural Health and Family Planning, Gandhigram (1966), has also shown that 90%
of IUCD acceptors belong to the age group
25-29 years. While the study of acceptors at
the Rural Health Training center in Njafgarh (Bhandari, 1967) has shown that 57.2%
belong to the age group 25-34 years, the
Lucknow study (Seghal and Pandy, 1967)
showed 71-72% as belonging to the 2535 age group. The Delhi study (Baradwaj,
1967) showed 60% belonging to the 15-30
age group and 50% belonging to the 30-39
age group. A comparison of these studies
with the present one has shown broad similarities in age distribution of women accepting IUCD; only the Lucknow sample

Brief Reports

 

227

(Seghal and Pandy, 1967) shows a slight
variation.

The median age of insertion of the acceptors is found to be 27.8 years. This is only
one year Jess than the median age of 28.8
years arrived at by the Central Family Planning Institute in Delhi (Murty, 1967) which
itself is lower than that found in various
studies conducted in other countries.

RELIGIOUS COMPOSITION

Tt should be safe to assume that most
of the women who had come to the two hospitals belong to Trivandrum District. Ac

cording to 1961 census of the population of
Trivandrum District, 71% are Hindus, 18%
Christians, and 11% Muslims. A comparison of these proportions with the proportion
of the women acceptors according to religion
shows that a relatively smaller percentage
of Christians and Muslims have adopted the
IUCD (Table 2). However, the fact that
nearly 10% of IUCD acceptors among the
cases considered are Christians and 4% are
Muslims suggests that even though there are
religious objections in some quarters people
are adopting this method either because of
necessity or due to the financial incentives
provided.

NUMBER OF LIVING CHILDREN

The data in Table 3 indicate that about
24% of the women had exactly 3 living
children; and nearly 58% had 3 or less children living at the time of IUCD insertion.
Another study made in the Demographic
Training and Research Centre (Mohanty
and Rao, 1967) also showed that 60% of

the women had 3 or less children. If 4 or less
children are considered, the figure shoots
up to 74%. The Najafgarh study (Bhandari,
1967) has shown that 27.3% women had
1 to 3 children, while in the Lucknow study
(Seghal and Pandy, 1967) 81.9% had 3 or
more children when the IUCD was inserted.
Tt is thus seen that the Kerala women had

 

Social Biology

fewer children and are therefore accepting
the IUCD at an early stage of their fertility period, presumably for the purpose of
spacing.

The average number of living children
for the women at the time of IUCD insertion is 3.5, which is nearly one child less than
the average number (4.4) obtained in a
study of women enrolled in an urban clinic
in Delhi (Agarwala, 1968).

INTERVAL BETWEEN IUCD INSERTION
AND LAST DELIVERY
The length of the interval between last
delivery and IUCD insertion, in short, may
be taken as an indication of the fact that the
decision to have the IUCD inserted is made

at the proper time, since the period of exposure and the consequent risk of conception will be less. The distribution of females
according to the above-mentioned interval
is given in Table 4.

More than a third (36%) of the insertions
are within six months of last delivery. In
Agarwala’s study (1968), the percentage of
women who had the IUCD fitted before the
period of six months from the date of last
delivery is only 24.2%, The maximum percentage of women in his study comes under
the interval between 12 and 23 months,
while the maximum in the present study is
under the interval below six months. The

Vol. 17, No. 3

average interval in months of fitting the
IUCD after the last delivery is 16 months in
Agarwala’s study, whereas in the present
study it is only 14.2 months. The indications
are that the timing of the [UCD insertion in
relation to last delivery is more appropriate,
among Kerala women. A possible reason
is that the hospital staff motivate the women
who had delivered in these hospitals to accept IUCD and also cause the insertions to
take place without much loss of time.

INTERVAL BETWEEN IUCD INSERTION AND
LAST MENSTRUAL PERIOD

Doctors have recommended the first few
days after a menstrual period as the most
appropriate time for IUCD insertion, as this
will minimize the chances of conception.
How far this objective is achieved can be
broadly determined by an analysis of the
distribution of women according to interval
between last menstrual period (LMP) and
IUCD insertion. This type of analysis has
not been attempted in any of the previous
studies referred to in this paper . The details
are presented in Table 5.

Nearly 12% of the women had accepted
the loop within a week and about 47% within
14 days of the last menstrual period. In motivating women for IUCD insertion, there is
greater need to emphasize the importance
of fitting the [UCD immediately after the
menstrual period so as to avoid the risk of
conception having taken place before IUCD
insertion, which will give room for spurious
propaganda of conception occurring with
the IUCD inserted. However, nearly 44%
had the insertion in the critical period after
the last menses. Presumably the necessary
tests might have been made in these cases
to make sure that fertilization had not taken
place before the insertion. It may also be
noted here that some of the women might
not be having the regular menstrual cycle.
A classification of these cases by age and
parity, not attempted here, might reveal
interesting correlations.

EXPULSIONS, REMOVALS AND REINSERTIONS

Due to paucity of data, the rates of expulsion, removal, and reinsertion are based
on the follow-up data of only 170 cases in
the second hospital. The cut-off date is fixed
as March 31, 1967.

The analysis of clinical data is most conveniently carried out in terms of segments.
A segment is defined as a period of use starting with a first or later insertion and either
terminated by an event such as accidental
pregnancy, expulsion, removal, or continuing
as of the cut-off date. A case with no event
after the first insertion corresponds to a

single segment; each reinsertion contributes
one additional segment. An event not followed by reinsertion constitutes a closed
case. From the above data, the womanmonths of use and rates of each event and
closure are computed. The rates of expulsion, removal and reinsertion per 100 women
during a year are 10.58, 6.81, and 8.44 respectively. The rate of closure, that is removal or expulsion not followed by reinsertion, is 9.14 per 100 women for a year.
Thus, 91.86% of the cases are active after
one year. This may perhaps be due to the extreme interest taken by the staff of the hospital, both in canvassing as well as in the
follow-up and not, therefore, a representative figure,

230 Brief Reports

The Gandhigram study (Institute of Rural Health and Family Planning, 1966) has
yielded higher rates of removals and expulsions after a year, namely 16.8% and 10.0%,
respectively. The expulsion rate in Agarwala’s Delhi study (1968) after 12 months
of use is only 7.6% (as against 10.58% in
the present study), while the removal rate

that in Agarwala’s study. For purposes of

and the previous studies are given in Table 6.

SUMMARY

An analysis of the age composition of the
females revealed that 80% of the females

 

Social Biology

belong to the age group 20-34 years, and
84% are below 35 years.

Fifty-eight per cent of the women have
three or less children at the time of IUCD
insertion. Comparison with other studies
shows that Kerala women adopt IUCD earlier than their counterparts in other areas.

The IUCD has not become as popular
among Christians and Muslims as among
Hindus.

There seems to be a tendency to adopt
the IUCD soon after a delivery. About
one-third of the cases studied are within
six months of the last delivery.

The information on the interval between
the last menstrual period and IUCD insertion is available in 61% of the cases and
shows that only 12% are within 7 days.

Ninety-one per cent of the cases of IUCD
insertions are found active after one year.
This is a very high percentage compared
to results obtained from other studies,
but is probably due to the extreme interest
taken by the staff of the hospital in the
program.
