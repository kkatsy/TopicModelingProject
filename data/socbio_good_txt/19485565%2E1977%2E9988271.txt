ABSTRACT: Reproductive time lost through marital dissolution is a potential factor in decreased
fertility. This study of survey data from six Latin America metropolitan areas shows that, among
variables examined, type of marital union is the primary determinent of reproductive time lost.
The study establishes that appreciably more reproductive time is lost from consensual unions than
from legal ones. It also indicates that this difference cannot be explained by such social
background characteristics as a woman’s place of birth or educational attainment.

There is an apparent causal path leading from marital instability to reduced
fertility: the more unstable the unions, the
more time nonmarried after or between
unions. The more time thus “lost from
(legitimate) reproduction,” the lower the
fertility. Indeed, the time lost after and
between unions was specifically enshrined
two decades ago in the Davis-Blake list of
variables intermediate between cultural
factors and fertility (1956).

The supposed fertility-depressing effect
of reproductive time lost has been of
especial interest in the study of those areas
where marital instability is most prevalent. Thus, in studies of the Caribbean
particularly, the intermediate variable of
time lost through marital dissolution was
used to explain observed relationships between type of marital union (visiting, consensual, or legal) and fertility (Blake,
1955; Blake, 1961; Braithwaite and
Roberts, 1961; Cumper, 1966; Ebanks,
1973; Ibberson, 1956; Nag, 1971; Ram
and Ebanks, 1973; Tekse, 1967; Stycos
and Back, 1964). And indeed, students of
population policy have speculated about
the possibility of maintaining high levels
of instability or even increasing them as a

means “beyond family planning” toward
fertility reduction in societies with low effectiveness in birth control (Davis, 1967;
Yaukey, 1973).

However, evidence has begun to accumulate that the potential negative impact of time lost from marriage on fertility
can be confounded by other factors. There
is a tendency for the losses of time due to
marital dissolution to occur during the
least fecund older female ages (Yaukey,
1973; Onaka and Yaukey, 1973). If
marital dissolution and/or remarriage
probabilities are selective on the basis of
fecundity, then instability can result in attraction of fecund women to the married
state, pushing fertility upward; or, of
course, fecundity selectivity could work in
the reverse direction (Yaukey, 1973). If
there is a combination of effective birth
control and low desired family size, then
the same small desired family size can be
achieved eventually by women, in spite of
some time lost between unions, albeit with
a later average age of childbearing
(Yaukey, 1973). The start of a new union
may even initiate a new round of
childbearing with the new partner that
would not have occurred with the former

one (Chen et al., 1974; Ebanks et al.,
1974). The time “lost” may not all be at the
risk of reproduction, as when women are
pregnant when divorced (Ebanks et al.,
1974). Indeed, under conditions of a
shortage of adult males, it can be argued
that marital instability actually enhances
the aggregate time females spend in
marital unions by facilitating the sharing
of those males by women who would otherwise remain single (Marino, 1970). The
actual balance among all these factors
will, of course, vary widely with cultural
marital norms as well as demographic
situations (Cohen and Sweet, 1974; Goldstein, 1973; Thornton, 1975).

In spite of the fact that it can be confounded, reproductive time lost remains a
potential brake upon fertility, and important for study on that basis. Discussion of
reproductive time lost is necessarily
couched in the language of “all other
things being equal.”

We adhere in the present analysis to the
strategy of treating one link at a time in
the causal chain between cultural factors
and fertility (Yaukey, 1969). Thus,
reproductive time lost is treated as a
dependent variable rather than an intermediate one. The main independent variables are type of marital union (legal or
consensual) and social background characteristics (rural-urban origin, woman’s
education).

This research design was developed in a
pilot study performed on fertility survey
data for San José, Costa Rica (Onaka and
Yaukey, 1973). The central findings of
that study were (1) that although as much
as 10 per cent of women’s overall
reproductive period since first marriage
was lost because of marital] dissolution, the
losses were primarily in the older, less
fecund years of female age; (2) that consensual unions were associated with markedly greater time loss than were legal
unions; and (3) that this difference be
Reproductive Time Lost

101

tween consensual and legal unions could
not be explained on the basis of differences
in women’s education or rural-urban
origin.

The present study reanalyzes the same
survey data for San José, but supplements
it with identical data from five metropolises in different Latin American
countries: Buenos Aires, Argentina; Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil; Bogota, Colombia;
Mexico City, Mexico; and Caracas, Venezuela. Latin America seems a particularly
appropriate place to study the impact of
marital dissolution on time lost since consensual marriage is known to be more
normal there than in any other large world
region. Moreover, the inclusion of nonCaribbean countries allows us to broaden
the narrow perspective that may have
resulted from past intensive study of that
small region.

Besides broadening the pilot study by
comparative analysis, the present study
undertakes to separate the effects of
dissolution through divorce or separation
from those of widowhood. This separation
enables us to deal more specifically with
the supposed causal path leading from
consensual union to marital instability
(through divorce or _ separation) to
reproductive time loss. After a description
of the data, the article will present results
on the prevalence of reproductive time loss
and its age pattern, differences in
reproductive time lost by type of union
and social background, and differences by
type of union in divorce, separation, and
widowhood.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data source for the present study is
a program of comparative fertility surveys
carried out in 1963~64 in Buenos Aires,
Rio de Janeiro, Bogota, San José, Mexico
City, and Caracas, each a capital city.
(The program also included a survey of
Panama City, not included in the present

102

analysis for technical reasons.) The program of surveys was coordinated by the
Centro Latinoamericano de Demografia
(CELADE) which chose the cities to
represent the extreme variety among countries and their capital cities in Latin America (Mir6, 1966).

Although the data were gathered more
than a decade ago, there is little evidence
of rapid changes in Latin American
nuptiality patterns soon thereafter (Arretx,
1971; Yaukey and Thorsen, 1972). Moreover, the present analysis will focus on
interrelationships among variables, which
probably are more stable over time than
distributions on variables taken separately.

In each of the six surveys, the women
interviewed’ were a probability cluster
sample, based on the latest available census figures, of all women aged 20 to 50
years, regardless of marital status. The
number of interviews obtained ranged
from 2,087 to 2,353 for each metropolitan
area (Miré, 1966). For the present analysis, we purged these samples of the few
professed non-Catholic women, of women
born outside the country, and of women
who had never entered either a legal or a
consensual union. The remaining
subsamples ranged in size from 1,176 to
1,781 women.

The surveys provide unusually
complete data for the analysis of marital
dissolution. First, unlike most censuses,
the surveys went beyond asking the
present marital status of the respondents
and inquired about previous marital
unions. Second, unlike many fertility surveys, the surveys included in their populations not only women who were
presently married but also women whose
unions had dissolved.

The data available and specifically relevant to our analysis are (1) partial
marital-union histories, including dates of
initiation and dissolution of both last and

 

 

Onaka et al.

Social Biology

the next-to-last union, as well as the
nature of the last union (legal or consensual) and its method of dissolution (if any),
and (2) information on various social and
demographic background characteristics
of the women.

In spite of their unusual completeness in
marital histories, the data did have some
troublesome omissions of detail. Women
were asked only about most recent or
present union and the one preceding it (if
any), but not about any prior to those two.
Women were asked only about the type of
union (legal or consensual) with regard to
the most recent one, but not any preceding
one. Finally, we have no record of changes
in the definition of particular unions, such
as when couples start a union consensually
but later legitimize it by legally marrying.
Our attempts to circumvent these limitations are described in the appropriate
“Results” sections below.

Because the comparative survey program was a pioneering effort, data have
been subject to evaluation by a variety of
analysts (Mir6 and Rath, 1965; Mird,
1966; Stycos, 1968; Hass, 1971; Duncan,
1972). A review of these assessments gives
us some confidence in the validity of the
responses in almost all cities, including the
validity of responses about present and
past marital statuses. The data employed
are internally consistent (after our
eliminating a small number of inconsistent
cases) and do not deviate alarmingly from
independent relevant census distributions.

We regard the data from Rio de Janeiro
with a relatively high degree of skepticism. The Rio sample had the highest
refusal rate. The Rio sample had the
highest proportion of cases (2.9 per cent)
eliminated from the marital dissolution
analysis subsample on the basis of our
internal-consistency checks. The nonresponse rates appear to be quite high on
some of the questions for the Rio sample
(Hass, 1971, p. 66). Stycos comments that

Vol. 24, No. 2

with respect to the question on use of
specific birth control techniques, there is
an unusually low incidence of use of the
condom and withdrawal in Rio, a fact
which to him suggests faulty interviewing
(Stycos, 1968, p. 66). Although we will
analyze the Rio data along with those from
the other five cities, we counsel the reader
to place more emphasis on the results from
the other cities in drawing conclusions.

PREVALENCE OF REPRODUCTIVE TIME LOSS

The potential negative effect on fertility
of reproductive time lost due to marital
instability is limited by the proportion of
the fecund years since first marriage that
women spent after or between unions. In
this section we measure the time lost in the
six cities to women in all the supposedly
fecund years, 15-49, together. The negative impact of this loss on fertility is further limited by the distribution of the loss
among those female ages 15-49. Therefore, in this section we also show the age
pattern of the time loss within each of the
cities. First an explanation of our measures.

A proportion of reproductive time lost
was calculated for each woman. This
proportion can be denoted algebraically as
(a/b) X 100, where a equals exposure time
lost and 6 equals total potential exposure
time. The denominator is the maximum

Reproductive Time Lost

103

amount of reproductive time a woman
could spend in union, if no union was
dissolved; it was obtained by subtracting
the woman’s age at the date of the beginning of the first recorded union from her
age at the date of the interview. The calculation of the numerator depended on the
history of the woman’s union(s). If the
woman had been in her first union continuously up to the time of the interview,
then the numerator would be zero. If the
woman’s first union had been dissolved
and she had never entered another, then
the total time between the dissolution and
the interview was represented in the
numerator. If the woman’s first union had
been dissolved but she had entered another union, then the time between the
dissolution and the reunion was represented in the numerator. Finally, if the
woman had been in repeated unions, the
numerator would consist of the intervals
between unions and, where applicable,
the period between the end of the last
union and the interview. In the tables
below, summary percentages of time lost
are presented for classes of women by
combining both the numerators and the
denominators for women in the classes.

reproductive time lost in the entire span of
ages 15 through 49. The six cities differ
markedly, the degree of loss ranging from
4,2 per cent to 13.8 per cent. Table 1
orders the six cities from that with the
least time lost (Buenos Aires) to that with
the most (Caracas). Not surprisingly, the
cities follow the same order with respect to
the proportion of women entering more
than one recorded union, which ranges
from 2.3 per cent to 14.1 per cent; the
greater the proportion of multiple unions,
the greater the time lost.

Knowledge of a woman’s age-specific
reproductive time lost is important for two
reasons. First, time lost during the most
fecund part of a woman’s reproductive
period, say ages 20-29, represents a
greater loss of potential fertility than does
time lost during adolescent subfecundity
(ages 15-19) or the longer period of declining fecundity (ages 30-49). Second, the
mean length of generation (i.e., the average age difference between mother and
daughter) would be greater if the greatest
loss of time occurred in the beginning of a
woman’s reproductive period; a greater
proportion of her children would be born
later in her reproductive period (Coale and
Tye, 1961).

Table 1 shows that in all six metropolitan areas, the age-specific percentages of
reproductive time lost increase with each
successive five-year interval within the
total reproductive period, ages 15-49.
Thus, even though sizable proportions of
time were lost during oldest age periods (as
high as 41.8 per cent for Caracas), the
percentage of time lost from the most important age periods for fertility (20-24 and
25-29) exceeds 10 per cent only once.

This age pattern of time loss has been
found to be quite widespread internationally. For instance, Yaukey (1973) has
shown that the same tendency to greater
time loss with increasing female age
applies in three countries chosen to

represent extreme contrasts in divorce,
mortality, and remarriage patterns: India,
Sweden, and the United States (Yaukey,
1973, pp. 66-67). The major reasons
probably are (a) the increasing likelihood
of women being widowed and (0) the decreasing likelihood of being remarried
after divorce or widowhood as women age
(Yaukey, 1973, pp. 53-70).

TYPE OF UNION AS DETERMINANT OF
REPRODUCTIVE TIME LOST

The proportion of reproductive time lost
varies markedly by type of marital union
in all of the cities. Table 2 presents the
percentage of time lost by type of marital
union, both for the total reproductive period (15-49) and for segments of it. Excepting Rio de Janeiro, the percentage of
time lost for ages 15-49 is two or more
times as great for consensual unions as for
legal ones.

In the preceding section we observed
that when both types of unions were considered together there was a consistent increase in percentage of time lost with increasing female age. Table 2 shows that
with few anomalies this same pattern
applies to legal and consensual unions
considered separately. However, the general level of time lost for consensual unions
is so high that even earlier and more
fecund female ages have time losses which
could be significant for fertility. For instance, excluding Rio, the percentage time
losses for the age category 25-29 ranged
from 17.6 per cent to 23.7 per cent.

Given the age differences in reproductive time lost, could much of the large
differences in the percentages of total time
lost (ages 15-49) be attributed to the age
composition of populations in the different
types of marital unions? We attempted to
answer the question by calculating agestandardized percentages of time lost for
women in consensual and in legal unions.
The age composition used as standard was

the women’s total potential amount of
reproductive time spent since first marriage in each five-year age interval in the
total sample for all cities combined. The
differences between age-standardized percentages for consensual vs. legal unions
were almost identical to the differences
between unstandardized ones presented in
Table 2. Moreover, to the degree that
there was any change in the degree of difference, it increased with standardization,
rather than decreased, in five of the six
cities. We feel safe in concluding that differences in age composition did not contribute to the apparent differences between consensual and legal unions.

Not surprisingly, the overall percentage
of reproductive time lost for a city was
largely a function of the prevalence of consensuality among its marital unions. Thus,
Table 2 shows that the percentage of consensual unions in the cities follows almost
exactly the ordering of the cities on total
reproductive time lost, ranging from 2.1
per cent consensual in Buenos Aires to
37.0 per cent consensual in Caracas.

Before proceeding further with the results, we should remind the reader of three
troublesome limitations of the data and
their potential impact upon the results.
Fiyst, the marital-union histories obtained
may have been only partial. They recorded the last union and the next-to-last
(if any), but did not record information on
any preceding union even if there were
one. Table 2 shows that the proportion of
women having more than one union
ranged from 2.3 per cent (in Buenos Aires)
to 14.1 per cent (in Caracas). The proportion having more than two _ probably
would be considerably less than that, but
still might alter the results in some cities.

Second, and perhaps more important,
the survey differentiated between legal
and consensual unions only for the women’s /ast union. If the woman entered more
than one union, the survey failed to record

et al. Social Biology
whether the preceding union was legal or
consensual. Therefore, the women in
Table 2 were placed into the “legal” or
“consensual” category according to the
type of their most recent sexual union. We
would guess that there was very little
changing of kind of union in these populations for the following reason. A number
of studies have indicated that it is more
normal for women to move from early
consensual unions to later legal unions
than the reverse (Rodman, 1971; Yaukey
and Thorsen, 1972, p. 378). Therefore,
one would expect any appreciable change
of type of union to show up as a high
proportion of women currently (or most
recently) in legal unions having had prior
unions as well. But Table 2 shows the
contrary. The percentage of multiple
unions for women most recently in legal
unions ranged only from 1.5 per cent (in
Buenos Aires) to 5.3 per cent (in Caracas).
In order to determine whether these two
limitations of the data might have caused
spuriously large differences in figures of
time lost for consensual unions as
compared with legal ones, we made an
additional tabulation (not shown) confined
to those women for whom we had full
information on the nature of all unions
entered, i.e., those women who reported
entering only one union. The main difference between the results for this
subsample, as compared with the sample
in Table 2, is that the once-married
women had an even greater tendency for
any time loss to be clustered in the later
female ages, especially for consensuallymarried women. But the difference between consensual unions and legal ones
with respect to percentage time lost to
women aged 15-49 remains large in all of
the cities except Rio de Janeiro. Our conclusion is that these two limitations of the
data are not likely to mislead us seriously.
More troublesome are the effects of the
third limitation of the data. The surveys

 

 

 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

Vol. 24, No. 2

did not record changes in the definition of
particular unions. The most prevalent
pattern of change, reportedly, is the
redefinition of existing consensual unions
as legal after some years. Although we
have no direct evidence of the degree to
which this pattern was followed, Table 2
leads us to suspect its presence. The percentage of women most recently in legal
unions who mentioned any prior union is
very low, ranging from 1.5 per cent to 5.3
per cent for the cities. In contrast, the
percentage of women most recently in consensual unions admitting prior unions
ranged from 22.2 per cent to 40.0 per cent.

If such a pattern of relabeling existing
unions did exist, what would be the nature
of its influence on the relationship between
type of union and reproductive time lost?
It probably would increase the difference
between presently consensual and presently legal unions with respect to time lost,
due to the following process. Consensual
unions which seem durable to the partners
are the ones most likely to be legalized;
consensual unions appearing less durable
will not be legalized. That is, apparent
durability will become a determinant of
whether a union will be labeled consensual
or legal. From one point of view, this injects an element of circularity into any
argument about type of union causing
marital instability and in turn influencing
reproductive time lost. From another
point of view, one can argue that such a
supposed pattern would not in any way
contradict the conclusion that legalization
of a union—whether at the outset or later
on—represents a greater degree of
commitment to durability than does entering a consensual union and promises less
reproductive time lost.

SOCIAL BACKGROUND CHARACTERISTICS, TYPE
OF UNION, AND REPRODUCTIVE TIME LOST

We use the general term “socialbackground characteristics” to refer to so
Reproductive Time Lost

107

cial positions occupied relatively early in
women’s lives, such as rural-urban community of childhood residence or socioeconomic status of family of orientation,
which could have influenced women’s
adult life choices. The influence of such
social-background factors could “explain”
the observed relation between type of
reproductive time lost to the degree that
(1) the social-background characteristics
were determinants of the degree of
reproductive time lost, (2) the socialbackground factors were also determinants of the type of union entered, and (3)
after controlling for these associations,
there was less remaining association between type of union and reproductive time
lost. In this section we will address those
three topics in order.

The social-background characteristics
we tested were (a2) the woman’s place of
birth and (6) the woman’s educational
attainment. Place of birth is taken to
represent the distinction between rural
and urban upbringing. (Of course, rural
birth in this sample also identifies a
woman as a rural-to-urban internal migrant during her lifetime.) Educational
attainment is taken to represent the socioeconomic status of the family from which
she comes, as well as her own qualifications. Both rural-urban origin and socioeconomic background have been found
to be related to fertility and marital patterns, both generally and in these cities in
particular (CELADE and CFSC, 1972,
Chap. 3; Yaukey and Thorsen, 1972). It is
to be noted that the time referent for the
distinctions being employed here (birth
and completion of primary education) are
prior to the likely entry into marital unions
and thus could not be influenced by
marital history. Thus, these two variables
should supply good tests of the
relationship between type of union and
reproductive time lost.

percentages of reproductive time lost both
by place of birth and by level of education
attained. Age standardization was by the
same method described in the preceding
section, using the distribution of reproductive time susceptible to loss for the
total population of all cities together as the
standard. Women born in rural areas and
women who had not completed primary
education tended to have slightly greater
percentages of time lost in each of the six
cities. Although the differences between
pairs of classes were consistent, they were
not large, ranging from 1.0 to 5.2 percentage points for place of birth and from 0.2
to 6.0 percentage points for educational
attainment. Not shown in this summary
table is the fact that differences in the
same direction were found separately for
each five-year age interval with very few
reversals.

Table 3 also presents the percentages of
women whose last unions were consensual
both by place of birth and by level of

completed primary school had higher percentages of consensual unions. Differences

Table 4 presents the percentages of

union in terms of the dependent variable,
we would expect to see consensual vs.
legal differences in percentage of reproductive time lost for the “total” row to
shrink when subject to classification and
cross-classification in lower rows. Generally, they do mot shrink. The association
between type of union and degree of
reproductive time lost seems to withstand
this test. (We will formalize the test further, below.)

Incidentally, the cross-classification also
points out that place of birth and
education influence the amount of repro

ductive time lost regardless of type of
marital union. Although the pattern
among the metropolitan areas is not uniform, generally (1) women who do not
complete primary school tend to lose more
reproductive time than women who have
completed primary school, and (2) women
from rural areas lose more time then
women from urban areas, regardless of the
type of marital union they enter. The lack
of uniform pattern of percentages of time
lost by social-background characteristics
indicates that these factors differ in their
effect on the marital patterns in each of the
metropolitan areas.

We have preliminary evidence that the
associations (1) between social background
and time lost and (2) between type of
union and time lost are fairly independent
of each other. This observation is formalized and made more precise in a
component analysis summarized in Table

(second row) 16.2 per cent by place of
birth separately; (third row) 3.7 per cent
by educational attainment separately; and
(fourth row) 5.3 per cent by the interaction
between the two. By subtraction, we find
that (fifth row) 74.8 per cent of the difference in reproductive time lost between
women in consensual and legal unions
remains unexplained by the operation of
place of birth and educational attainment
in Caracas,

It turns out that this residual-effect
figure of 74.8 per cent for Caracas is the
smallest for the six metropolitan areas except for Rio de Janeiro. At the other extreme is a residual of 119.7 per cent for
Buenos Aires, meaning that place of birth
and educational attainment actually had
“masked” the effect of type of union to a
minor degree. The figures for the three
remaining cities all cluster around 95 per
cent.

It seems safe to generalize that the impact of type of union upon reproductive
time lost remains largely unexplained by
these social background differences.
Among the factors we have studied, the
dominant determinant of reproductive
time lost is type of marital union.

However, the degree to which this generalization is true varies with the city, as we
will discuss at the end of the article.

RELATIVE STABILITY OF CONSENSUAL AND
LEGAL UNIONS

Until now we have been elaborating the
general finding that appreciably more
reproductive time is lost from consensual
unions than from legal unions. If that
finding be true, then by implication consensual unions are characterized by
greater risk of dissolution while the
woman lives and/or greater delay in remarriage.

In this section we present evidence directly on the relative risk of dissolution for
consensual and legal first unions. Further,
we isolate divorce and separation from
widowhood as means of dissolution to find
whether the supposed instability of consensual unions is due to higher voluntary
dissolution, higher involuntary dissolution, or both. Finally, we investigate
whether the relative instability of consensual unions is partially a reflection of
the earlier age at marriage of women in
consensual first unions.

In order to arrive at comparable summary figures representing relative risk of
marital dissolution, we adapt the mathematical model of the life table. That model
shows the implications of a series of timespecific risks of attrition from a population

Reproductive Time Lost

111

by showing what would happen to a
hypothetical cohort of people who experienced those risks serially. In the life table
itself, the risks suffered are a series of
age-specific mortality rates and the hypothetical cohort is one which entered the
population at risk simultaneously at birth.
The same basic model has been employed
frequently to express the implications of a
series of age-specific marriage rates on a
hypothetical cohort of single men or
women (Bogue, 1969, pp. 627—629). In the
present case, the generating function is a
series of duration-specific probabilities of
marital dissolution, and the hypothetical
cohort consists of women entering their
first marriages simultaneously at duration
zero.

Table 6 presents a truncated marital
dissolution table for consensual unions
and can be used to illustrate the method.
Standard life-table terminology is used
throughout. In the stub column one sees
the entire marriage duration span (for
which we have sufficient case data)
divided into segments. We truncated at
the twenty-third anniversary because we
were concerned with durability during the
reproductive ages only; we had few cases
of duration of more than twenty-three
years among our samples aged less than
fifty years. Consequently, the “expectation
of years in the union” in the last column
has a complex meaning. The logical max

imum expectation at the beginning of the
marriage would approach twenty-three
completed years because of the truncation
of the table. The figure at the top of the
column at the far right (15.50 in our illustration) tells how many of those years, on
the average, unions in this hypothetical
cohort would last. It is this summary
figure which is the main reason for the
construction of the table. It is comparable
for all marital-dissolution tables we constructed, since the same truncation of
durations was employed in all. We shall
call it the “index of durability” of the
specified class of marital unions.

years in Caracas to 8.4 years in Bogota.
This is, of course, consonant with our earlier finding of less reproductive time
having been lost from legal unions in the
five cities. It shows that the time-lost differential was not based solely on differences in delay of remarriage, but that differential risk of marital dissolution was at
least a major factor.

Where consensual unions are on the
average less durable, is this fact due to
greater risk of widowhood, of divorce or
separation, or both? The upper section of
Table 8 presents indexes of durability by
type of union and by cause of marital
dissolution, voluntary (divorce or separa

ity for legal and for consensual first
marital unions in each of the six metropolitan areas. With the exception of Rio de
Janeiro, all cities show legal unions to
have been more stable during the first
twenty-three years of experience. The

tion) and involuntary (widowhood), for all
cities taken together. It is clear that the
superior durability of legal unions is due to
their resistance to divorce or separation
rather than any greater resistance to
mortality by their husbands. The index of
durability with respect to widowhood is
virtually the same for both types of

unions. But the legal unions have an index
of durability with respect to divorce and
separation six years more than consensual
unions.

Finally, why should consensual unions
be so much more susceptible to divorce
and separation during the first two
decades since marriage? We have data to
apply to only one possibility, the differential ages of women when they entered
these first marriages. The obvious hypothesis is that the tendency for greater divorce
and separation from consensual unions is
explained by a lower average age at first
marriage in consensual unions coupled
with a greater tendency toward divorce
and separation in early marriages.

To the degree that the hypothesis is correct, we should see the following in the
lower section of Table 8. The differences
between the indexes of durability for legal
vs. consensual unions in the total (“all
ages”) population should be larger than
the legal-consensual differences in each of
the separate age-at-marriage classes. But
this is not the case. The difference for the
total, 6.0 years, is only slightly smaller
than the mean of differences for the separate age classes, 6.1 years. Thus, we have
no evidence that differential age at first
marriage explains the lesser resistance to
divorce and separation of consensual
unions in these samples.

We feel compelled to remind the reader
that this apparently greater durability of
legal unions in the face of divorce and
separation may be due partially to a
redefinition of first unions over time. In
the marital dissolution tables which
produced the indexes of durability, first
unions were Classified legal or consensual
on the basis of the respondent’s statement
at the time of the interview. However, it is
possible that unions then called legal could
have been consensual for an earlier part of
their existence. Our data would not have
recorded this fact. If there is a tendency

Reproductive Time Lost

113

for the more stable of the consensual
unions to later be legalized, and the less
stable ones to remain nonlegal, then we
might tend to exclude from our marital
dissolution tables for consensual unions
those unions appearing to the partners to
be durable enough to justify legalization.
Whether this situation would mean that
we were exaggerating the differential
durability of legal and consensual unions
is a matter of interpretation.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

We can summarize briefly our findings
regarding the differential reproductive
time lost from consensual and _ legal
marital unions. (We have to except Rio de
Janeiro from these generalizations; see
below.) (1) Markedly greater percentages
of reproductive time were lost to women
because of dissolution of consensual
unions than dissolution of legal unions. (2)
Although less-educated and rural-born
women tended to have greater percentages
of reproductive time lost, these associations were generally independent of the
one between type of union and percentage
of time lost; that is, the impact of type of

union remained largely unexplained by

differences in the social background of the
women. (3) Although consensual and legal
unions did not differ in durability against
the threat of widowhood, consensual
unions were markedly more likely then
legal ones to dissolve early through
divorce or separation. Moreover, this
greater susceptibility to voluntary marital
dissolution did not seem to be explained by
any tendency to marry at younger ages.
Our guess is that the greater ease of
divorce or separation from consensual
unions compared to legal ones in these
entirely Catholic populations is the major
factor behind the observed differential
durability and reproductive time lost. We
speculate (1) that legally married couples
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

114 Onaka

in these Catholic populations have more
difficulty than do consensually married
couples in arranging either divorce or
separation, (2) that potential partners are
therefore more reluctant to enter legal
unions than consensual ones until they are
ready to make long-term commitments to
them, and (3) that those consensual unions
which do prove to be durable have a tendency to be redefined as legal.

Up to this point, our emphasis has been
on generalizations holding true for all of
the cities (perhaps with the exception of
Rio). But these cities come from widely
spread parts of Latin America, countries
representing vastly different degrees of
technological development and probably
having somewhat different cultural
meanings associated with consensual
marriage. Moreover, the cities have just
been shown to differ widely both on our
dependent variable, reproductive time
lost, and in one of our key independent
variables—prevalence of consensuality in
marriage.

The task of classifying cities will be
made immensely easier if the reader will
permit us to eschew the case of Rio de
Janeiro. In defense of this suggestion, we
remind the reader (1) that in our preliminary evaluation of the data we singled out

et al. Social Biology

Rio’s survey for cautionary comments and
(2) that in the results we have presented
since then, Rio has been a perplexingly
consistent exception to almost every pattern we have found for the other five
cities. The following comments are for
those readers willing to tolerate this exclusion.

The remaining five cities (and probably
the countries they represent) fall nicely
into three classes with respect to degree of
prevalence of consensuality among marital
unions; low consensuality (Buenos Aires),
medium consensuality (Bogota, San José,
and Mexico City), and high consensuality
(Caracas). The cities are thus classified in
Table 9. For these three classes of cities,
the higher the degree of consensuality of
unions, (1) the greater the percentage of
reproductive time lost through marital
dissolution, (2) the less the difference between consensual and legal unions with
respect to percentage of reproductive time
lost through dissolution (that is, the
greater the percentage of time lost from
legal unions and the less the time lost from
consensual ones, even though the direction
of the difference remains), (3) the more
that social-background factors explain the
relationship between type of union and
percentage of reproductive time lost, and

(4) the greater the educational differences
in reproductive time lost. All of these
findings suggest that in high-consensuality
cities, there is a tendency for the distinction between legal and nonlegal unions to
diminish and for the remaining differences
in marital patterns to reflect more simply
location in the social structure. This hypothesis, based on five cases, is offered in
the hope of future testing.

Finally, it seems appropriate to remind
the reader that we have been dealing with
only one segment of an apparently complex set of causal paths leading from marriage to fertility. Suppose it be true that
entering consensual unions leads to greater
risk of divorce or separation which in turn
leads to greater reproductive time lost.
That does not mean that consensual
unions need tend to have lower fertility. It
need not even mean that less durable
unions need be associated with less fertility, for (as elaborated in the introduction)
many factors can confound that tendency.

This point is illustrated by comparable
data on another metropolis in Latin
America—Guayaquil, Ecuador. The
analysis showed that voluntary marital

Reproductive Time Lost

115

dissolution produced two partially counterbalancing influences on fertility: (1)
depression through loss of reproductive
time and (2) inflation through starting of
new childbearing cycles with new partners
(Chen et al., 1974).

It seems in retrospect that we and others
have been burdened with a simplistic view
of the potential causal paths involved in
relationships between marital stability and
fertility. The apparent solution to that
problem is to initiate studies based on
detailed and exhaustive marital and
reproductive histories (including data on
women not currently married) and
exploratory multivariate analysis.
