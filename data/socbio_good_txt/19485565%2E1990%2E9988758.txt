Short-term Fluctuations in Death
by Cause, Temperature, and Income
in the United States, 1930-1985

ABSTRACT: Disclosures that this decade has had the five hottest years ever recorded globally
raise concern that extreme temperatures might be associated with higher mortality. An analysis
of fluctuations in annual cause-specific deaths, seasonal temperatures, and annual income per
capita in Massachusetts, Michigan, Washington, Utah, North Carolina, and Mississippi, 1930
to 1985, suggests that, on the contrary, a temperature increase throughout the year was
associated with fewer deaths from all causes combined, including deaths from infectious
diseases, heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, pneumonia, and influenza. An average
temperature increase of one degree Fahrenheit was associated with a more than 2 per cent
decline in deaths from pneumonia and influenza. The only category of deaths showing no
significant association was death from malignant neoplasms. Compared to spring, summer,
and fall temperature fluctuations, unusually cold winter temperatures had the strongest fatal
effects, but only in North Carolina and Mississippi. The greatest cumulative temperature effects
on mortality were found in the same two states. Controlling for annual fluctuations in income
per capita did not influence the relationship between temperature and mortality. There was
evidence suggesting that the level of wealth ameliorated the fatal effects of extreme temperatures. In conclusion, unusually warm weather was followed by fewer deaths; unusually cold
weather, by more deaths.

There is a rich literature about the
seasonality of temperature and its effect
on mortality. Many studies have focused
on the effects of unusually low temperatures in the winter and higher than usual
temperatures in the summer (Ellis,
1972; Lloyd, 1986) In both the United
States and Europe, an increase in the
number of deaths has been recorded after winter cold spells and summer hot
spells. Since increases in temperature
produce opposite effects on mortality in
the summer and the winter, it is of interest to determine what the effect of a
year-long high or low temperature
would be on mortality. A previous study
(Larsen, 1989) showed that overall mortality (the crude death rate) in the

United States from 1921 to 1985 was
higher in July and August when the
weather was warmer than usual, while
during the rest of the year unusually
warm weather was followed by lower
overall mortality. However, different
causes of death are probably not equally
sensitive to temperature fluctuations.
This study aims to clarify whether
deaths in the United States from some
diseases (cardiovascular) are systematically more greatly affected by extreme
temperatures than are deaths from
other diseases (malignant neoplasms).
The present analysis is confined to examining fluctuations in annual causespecific deaths, because, at the state
level, statistics about cause of death

were recorded only on a yearly basis until 1968 (National Center for Health Statistics). Monthly temperature data are
available. However, we create four seasonal temperature variables, which enables us to obtain a more parsimonious
model and to take into account seasonal
differences in the relationship between
short-term fluctuations in temperature
and mortality.

In general, the number of deaths
from cardiovascular diseases and cerebrovascular accidents are higher subsequent to a summer heat wave and to a
winter cold wave (Lloyd, 1986; Vuori,
1987). Keatinge et al. (1984) suggest one
mechanism by which cold can cause
deaths from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Subjects exposed to
cold have increases tn cell volume, circulating platelets, and viscosity of the
blood, all factors which increase blood
pressure and may contribute to an increased risk of death from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.
Deaths from respiratory diseases are
found to increase significantly after unusually cold fall and winter weather,
probably due to an increased incidence
and transmission of viral infections (Bull
and Morton, 1978; Leppaluoto, 1984;
Lloyd, 1986). There is also evidence that
susceptibility to infectious diseases is increased during warm weather, and that
summer heat waves may be followed by
an unusual number of deaths from infectious diseases (Howe, 1972). The relationship between short-term fluctuations in temperature and cause-specific
mortality has been documented in a
time-series analysis of historical London
(Galloway, 1985). However, findings
from historical populations may not apply to contemporary America under
prevailing conditions of advanced medical technology, good housing facilities,

Death by Cause, Temperature, and Income 173

high hygiene, and sanitary food storage.
Also, the major categories of causespecific deaths (e.g., cardiovascular diseases and diseases of the heart) in
twentieth-century America are different
from those in historical London (e.g.,
typhus and tuberculosis).

Possible significant relationships between short-term fluctuations in temperature and mortality concerns individuals as well as public health policy
makers. For instance, the summer of
1988 was exceptionally hot in many areas of the United States, and the news
media announced repeatedly that many
deaths could be avoided if people prone
to suffering from heat waves (cardiac
patients and elderly people in general)
were provided financial aid to install air
conditioners. A careful analysis of the
relationship between temperature
changes and cause-specific deaths is
needed in order to support arguments
for such aid. .

Whether improvements in factors
such as housing, heating, air conditioning, and clothing can reduce fatal effects
of extreme temperatures concerns both
Americans and Europeans and has been
debated in Lancet. The Editor of Lancet
stated in the November 2, 1985 issue
that “‘it is by no means certain that further improvement in house heating
would have a great impact on mortality,” while Dr. Lloyd responded in the
December 21, 1985 issue that ‘“‘improvement of the thermal environment, not
only in housing but also at work, might
strikingly reduce the winter excess of
deaths in the UK.” The fatal impact of
extreme temperatures may be influenced by the level of wealth (e.g., the
general housing standard), but it may
also be affected by short-term economic
fluctuations, in that many people may
not be able to afford appropriate heatDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

ing during periods of high unemployment.

No previous study has attempted to
determine the association between seasonal temperature fluctuations and annual cause-specific deaths in the United
States, or in representative areas of the
United States, or has examined the
trend over a long-period of time. However, studies of the above design could
be useful in assessing whether public
health policies should be implemented
to ameliorate the effects of unusually
cold winter weather and warmer-thanusual summer weather on mortality.
Furthermore, public health policies
might be more effective if the target
population were better defined. To extend our knowledge about the relationship between short-term temperature
fluctuations and mortality, and to help
formulate policy implementations, this
study is designed to answer the following questions:

1. Is there a significant relationship between short-term temperature fluctuations and mortality by cause of death?

2. Does the relationship between temperature and mortality vary (e.g., the
seasonal pattern and the lag structure)
by cause of death?

3. Did the effects of temperature fluctuations on mortality vary over time from
1930 to 1985, or by state of residence?

4, Does controlling for short-term fluctuations in income per capita and the
level of income per capita influence the
relationship between short-term temperature fluctuations and mortality?

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The analysis includes the years 1930
to 1985. The latter is the most recent
year for which mortality statistics are
available. Data about income per capita
by state of residence are not available
before 1929. Since the temperature dif
Social Biology

fers substantially across the United
States, six states from different climatic
regions are chosen to form a representative sample, thus allowing inferences to
be made for the entire United States.
The states analyzed are Massachusetts,
Michigan, Washington, Utah, North
Carolina, and Mississippi. At the state
level, mortality statistics for causespecific deaths are available only on a
yearly basis. Therefore, the present
study is confined to annual fluctuations
in cause-specific deaths and income per
capita, and monthly temperature. Our
previous study comparing monthly temperature fluctuations and monthly crude
death rates found that the decreased
mortality in a warm winter outweighed
by far the increased mortality seen in a
hot summer (Larsen, 1989). Hence, the
findings from the present study, using
only annual mortality data, can be expected to reflect primarily the more
dominant pattern of higher-than-usual
winter temperatures followed by fewer
deaths.

DEATHS BY CAUSE

Annual data for deaths by cause, by
state of residence, are available for the
United States (Mortality Statistics; Vital
Statistics of United States). The International Classification of Diseases was modified several times during 1930 to 1985,
but the appropriate groups are combined and consistent series of death by
cause are constructed (see Table 1). The
causes of death we consider are: all
deaths, infectious diseases (not including pneumonia and influenza), malignant neoplasms, diseases of the heart,
cerebrovascular diseases, and pneumonia and influenza. The death counts by
cause are not converted into rates, because it is questionable whether the denominator should be the total popula

tion or a subgroup. Furthermore,
changes in the population are slow and
trendlike, and the trends in the series
are explicitly modelled, and then removed by first differencing (as described
below). Finally, most of the variation
from one year to the next takes place in
the numerator (the deaths), while variation in the denominator (the population
size) tends to be relatively small if the
population is relatively large.

"TEMPERATURE

The average monthly temperature in
Fahrenheit for one station in each state
is used (Climatological Data; Report of
the Chief of the Weather Bureau). The
selected stations are located in Boston,
Detroit, Seattle, Salt Lake City, Charlotte, and Vicksburg, respectively, in
Massachusetts, Michigan, Washington,
Utah, North Carolina, and Mississippi.
There might be differences in the level
of the temperature within a state, but
the monthly fluctuations are very similar. For each state from 1930 to 1955, the
temperature read at the selected station
and an average measure based on readings from many stations are highly correlated. The average measure is not
published after 1955.

We create four temperature variables, one for each season. The average
temperature in the winter (average of
January, February, and March) spring
(average of April, May, and June), summer (average of July, August, and September), and fall (average of October,
November, and December). The four
seasonal temperature variables are constructed so that they measure associations between warmer-than-usual winter weather and lower mortality, and
between warmer-than-usual summer
weather and higher mortality (Larsen,
1989), and so that they are comparable

 

 

Social Biology

to the temperature variables used by
other researchers (Eckstein et al., 1985;
Galloway, 1985).

INCOME PER CAPITA

Short-term fluctuations in the economy are measured by fluctuations in income per capita by state of residence
(Bureau of Economic Analysis). Massachusetts has the highest level of wealth
according to income per capita, followed by Michigan, Washington, Utah,
North Carolina, and Mississippi.

METHOD

Yearly fluctuations in mortality may
be caused by many factors. If all other
variables were fixed, and only the temperature varied, one could establish the
relationship of yearly fluctuations in
mortality and temperature. The temperature and mortality relationship is not
affected by other variables, as long as
these other variables are orthogonal to
temperature. In most cases temperature
is an exogenous variable. It might,
therefore, be valid to analyze a model of
only temperature and mortality. Medical technology, housing, diet, etc., mproved during 1930 to 1985, and as a
consequence the fatal effects of temperature fluctuations may have declined
over time. To include this change, the
interaction of temperature and time is
added to the model, and so is the state
and temperature interaction to account
for variation in the relationship between
temperature and mortality by state of
residence.

We cannot discount the possibility
that the effects of yearly temperature
fluctuations on mortality are confounded by extraneous variables. For
example, it may be argued that temperature fluctuations can affect fluctuations
in wealth, e.g., unusually cold winter

Vol. 37, No. 3-4

weather may lead to higher unemployment and lost wages, which may lead to
more deaths. However, it is not feasible
to add too many variables to the model.
We get too few degrees of freedom; the
variables analyzed may be correlated;
and only relatively few reliable and valid
time series are available from 1930 to
1955. To take into account that the link
between temperature fluctuations and
deaths may be affected by variations in
the economy, we suggest controlling for
fluctuations in income per capita and the
interactions between income per capita
and time period and between income
per capita and state of residence.

A general model of the relationship
between deaths, temperature, and income per capita by state of residence
from 1930 to 1985 may be specified as
follows:

DEATHS,

3 4° 1

]= s= =

INC,_;'0+ 8 TME--,) exp( +yTIME + «

where DEATHS = annual number of
deaths; TEMP = temperature in Fahrenheit; TIME = time period; INC =
income per capita by state of residence,
t = 1(1930), 2(1931), ... . 56(1985);
s = 1 (January, February, March),

September), 4(October, November,

The annual number of deaths in year
t(DEATHS,) is modelled as a function
of the temperature (TEMP,,,) in season s at time ¢ to t-k, and income per
capita (INC,.;) at time ¢ to t-j. The exponents (ask + Bs x TIME,.x) and Xj + 5;
TIME,,;) allow the effects of tempera

177

ture and income per capita on deaths to
change over time. The time trend in
DEATHS, is modelled by an exponential curve. Finally, the model specified in
Equation (1) requires annual data, and
one equation can be estimated for each
cause of death considered. In this fashion, each season’s temperature and annual income per capita can exert a different effect on deaths from different
causes.

To take into account the possibility of
delayed temperature effects, we propose to estimate temperature effects at
lag zero and lag one year (Bull and Morton, 1978; Galloway, 1985; Larsen,
1989). Concerning delayed income-percapita effects, we include the lags 0, 1, 2,
and 3 years. The literature is inconclusive with respect to how long extreme
economic conditions continue to affect
mortality. In a study of age-adjusted
mortality in the United States, Brenner
included the unemployment rate at lag 5
years, and in another study of heart disease mortality the unemployment rate
was lagged 3 and 10 years (Brenner,
1983; Brenner, 1987). It may be assumed that economic peaks and troughs
affect people for a long period, but
whether this period spans 3, 5, or 10
years is unknown. We propose to include up to a three-year delayed effect
of fluctuations in income per capita.

The multiplicative model specified in
Equation (1) is transformed into an additive model using a natural-log transformation. Furthermore, we are examining whether unusually cold or hot
weather is associated with higher mortality, so the series analyzed must be stationary, that is, have no trend or drift
and a constant variance. Otherwise, the
estimated relationship between shortterm fluctuations in two or more series
might be disguised by, for instance, a

by taking first differences of the natural

have the same period-specific error, and
serial autocorrelation of the residuals is
corrected for by a second order autoregression.

The interpretation of the coefficients
estimated in Model (4) focuses on proportional changes in mortality due to a
small change in temperature. We are interested in the total effect on
DEATHS ,, if the temperature changed
in each month of the year, e.g., the temperature increased one degree Fahrenheit each month throughout the year,
and how this effect changes over time,

RESULTS

As a first step, parsimonious models
of deaths by cause and temperature are
developed, and the impact of controlling for annual fluctuations in income
per capita is examined. Next, the cumulative temperature effect on mortality,
the seasonal pattern, and the time lags
between temperature and mortality are
analyzed.

PARSIMONIOUS MODEL SELECTION

The statistical measures used to determine whether a variable adds significantly to the model are presented in
Table 2. Here, the discussion centers on
the substantive issues considered in the
model building. We hypothesize that
seasonal temperature fluctuations affect
mortality significantly, that the effects of
temperature On mortality vary over time

from 1930 to 1985, and by state of residence. Furthermore, controlling for annual fluctuations in income per capita
may affect the relationship between
mortality and temperature.

The form of any trend in the relation
of mortality to temperature from 1930 to
1985 is unknown. Hence, we examine
whether there is a linear trend, or
whether there is no trend within the periods 1930-39, 1940-49, . . . ,1970~85.
We examine also whether the effects of
temperature on mortality differed between only the period after 1950, and
the period 1950 and earlier. We find that
there is no linear trend. A fixed trend
1930-39, 1940-49, etc., fits the data
best, although including a trend improves the fit significantly only for
deaths from cerebrovascular diseases,
and from pneumonia and influenza.
Furthermore, only winter temperature

180 Larsen

fluctuations (average of January, February, and March) affect mortality differently across the six states studied; effects
of temperature variations in the other
seasons are the same for all states.

Based on these preliminary findings,
GROSS models of the relationship between temperature and mortality for
each cause of death are estimated (Table 3). A second regression analysis controlling for economic factors produce
the NET models. In the NET models,
the main effects of income per capita,
the interaction between income per capita and time period (1930-39, 1940-49,
. .. , 1970-85), and the interaction between income per capita and state of residence are added to the GROSS
models. More aspects of the model specified in Equation (4) are explored, but
no further interesting results are obtained.

The NET models fit the data significantly better than the GROSS models,
with the exception of the model of
deaths from malignant neoplasms (see
Table 2). Thus, this analysis supports
the notion that recessions and mortality
are associated (excluding deaths from
malignant neoplasms), as suggested by
Brenner (Brenner, 1987; National Center for Health Statistics). The findings
about the direct relationship between
income per capita and mortality will be
analyzed further in a subsequent paper.
Instead, this analysis focuses on whether
the fatal effects of extreme temperatures are influenced by controlling for
annual fluctuations in income per capita, 1.e., whether there are substantial
differences between the GROSS and
NET models. The coefficients that are

EFFECTS, SEASONAL PATTERNS AND TIME
Lacs BETWEEN TEMPERATURE AND
CAUSE OF DEATH

In general, a temperature increase is
followed by lower mortality, and vice
versa (Figure 1). (The following results
are from the NET models.) Fluctuations
in the temperature affect deaths from
pneumonia and influenza, in particular,
and deaths from other infectious diseases. For instance, an increase in the
winter, spring, summer and fall temperature of one degree Fahrenheit is associated with more than a 2 per cent decrease in the number of deaths from
pneumonia and influenza in the period
1970 to 1985 in each state examined. In
contrast, in each state, the number of
deaths from malignant neoplasms responds less than 0.5 per cent to a one degree Fahrenheit temperature change in
the entire period 1930 to 1985. The association between temperature and causespecific death changed from 1930 to
1985 only for deaths from cerebrovascular diseases, pneumonia, and influenza.
Specifically, warmer-than-usual summer weather was followed by more
deaths from cerebrovascular diseases in
the decade 1930 to 1939, while a reverse
and weak association prevailed after
1940; deaths from pneumonia and influenza responded less to unusually cold
winter weather from 1950 to 1959 relative to the years 1930 to 1949 and 1960 to

1985. Deaths are in particular affected
by temperature fluctuations in North
Carolina and Mississippi. These two
states rank lowest with respect to the
level of income per capita. Hence, it
may be that the level of wealth, and not
fluctuations in wealth, ameliorates the
fatal effects of extreme temperatures.

Mortality is most responsive to a one
degree Fahrenheit increase in the winter
temperature in Mississippi (Figure 2). In
Mississippi deaths from all causes, except malignant neoplasms, are associated with more than a 0.5 per cent decline following a one degree Fahrenheit
increase in the winter temperature in the
same year. For cerebrovascular deaths
the one-year delayed winter temperature effects cancel the immediate effects, while the one-year delayed effects
are negligible for the other causes of
death considered. It should be noted
that fluctuations in the winter temperature have a minor effect on mortality in
the states of Massachusetts, Michigan,
Washington, and Utah. To explain the
differentials in the associations between
temperature and cause-specific death by
state of residence, more research 1s required.

The fatal effects of temperature fluctuations in the spring, summer, and fall
do not vary significantly by state of residence for any of the categories of causespecific death examined (Figure 3). Furthermore, the changes in cause-specific
deaths following fluctuations in spring,
summer, and fall temperatures are negligible compared to the winter patterns
found in North Carolina and Mississippi. Similar seasonal patterns were obtained in the analysis of monthly crude
death rates, with the exception that
higher-than-usual temperatures were associated with more deaths in the months

this study we do not replicate this reverse pattern for any of the categories of

CONCLUSION

The main finding of this study is that a
year-long temperature increase is followed by lower mortality, and correspondingly a decrease in temperature is
followed by higher mortality. This is the
case for all cause-of-death categories examined, with the exception of deaths
from malignant neoplasms which do not
respond to temperature fluctuations.
The association between mortality and
temperature did not generally change
from 1930 to 1985. Unusually warm
summer weather is found not to be followed by more deaths, as suggested in
our previous study (Larsen, 1989),
probably because annual mortality data

are used herein, which can obscure seasonal effects. For example, years with
unusually warm summer weather have
often warmer-than-usual weather
throughout the year, and the excess of
deaths following the summer heat may
be cancelled by the lower mortality associated with warmer-than-usual weather
during the rest of the year. To better disentangle the seasonal patterns between
fluctuations in cause-specific deaths and
temperature, we need daily, weekly, or
monthly data by state of residence or by
county. The Mortality Detail Files (National Center for Health Statistics) provide such data from 1968 and forward,
and several cross-section analyses could
be conducted.

Winter temperature fluctuations in
North Carolina and Mississippi have the
strongest effect on all the categories of
cause-specific deaths examined. This
pattern holds also in the analysis of
monthly crude death rates (Larsen,
1989). The finding that in the two Southern states of North Carolina and Mississippi people suffer more from extremely
low winter temperatures than people in
Massachusetts, Michigan, Washington,
and Utah suggests that higher levels of
general wealth ameliorate the fatal effects of unusually cold weather in the
winter. However, controlling for annual
fluctuations in income per capita does
not affect the mortality responses to
temperature fluctuations. Hence, this
analysis draws added policy relevance
from the fact that substantial funds have
been set aside in the federal budget by
the Low Income Energy Assistance Act
for expenditure to offset the effects on
mortality of weather variation.

Based on our results we suggest further research be carried out to assess the
need for economic assistance in coping
with weather variation. First, it is not
clear that economic assistance lowers
the number of deaths following a cold or
hot spell. Second, the link between economic factors and reduced mortality is
uncertain; e.g., does air conditioning
limit the fatal effects of summer heat,
and can better house insulation prevent
deaths during cold spells in the winter?
Third, the relationship between annual
mortality and winter temperature fluctuations can be considered rather weak,
although it is generally statistically significant. Finally, the stronger association
between temperature and mortality
found in North Carolina and Mississippi
compared to Massachusetts, Michigan,
Washington, and Utah may be caused

Social Biology

by factors that do not originate in economic need. One avenue to enhance our
understanding of the relationship between temperature and mortality, and
the possible intervention of economic as
well as cultural factors, may be to extend
the analysis to more states. Another
possibility is to analyze a number of
counties within the same state.

The finding that year-long unusually
warm weather is associated with fewer
deaths, and vice versa, does not clarify
whether mortality will fall or rise subsequent to a global warming trend, such as
predicted by the greenhouse theory. Inferences from annual fluctuations to
changes lasting many decades can be
hazardous. The mortality responses to
seasonal temperature fluctuations are
probably greater than to long-term
weather changes, because cultural and
economic adjustments (improvements
in housing, air conditioning, clothing,
etc.) can be made to accommodate people’s living conditions to a long-term
weather change. Furthermore, if a permanent weather change were to result in
an average temperature rise, then we
may find that extreme temperatures had
a different effect on mortality. For example, excess heat in the summer exerted a greater hazard, while colderthan-usual winter weather was less fatal
than shown from the data analyzed in
this study. Therefore, from this study no
inferences can be made to changes in
mortality, if a general warming of the
earth were on the way, as the greenhouse theory predicts. To determine the
effects of long-term changes in temperature on mortality, a cross-sectional
study examining the association of geographic variation in mean temperature
with variation in death rates is needed.
