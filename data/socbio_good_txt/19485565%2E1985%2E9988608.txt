Ethnic Differences in Alcohol Use,
Abuse, and Sensitivity: A Review
with Genetic Interpretation

ABSTRACT: The biomedical literature for the period 1978-84 was surveyed for nine categories of
alcohol response (consumption rate, absorption rate from the digestive tract, metabolism rate,
alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) variants, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) variants, “alcohol sensitivity,” cardiovascular changes, psychological changes, alcohol abuse), looking for
data on possible ethnic differences. These data were supplemented by selected earlier studies.
Excepting psychological changes (on which there were very few studies), evidence for ethnic (or
racial) differences was found in each category of response. The most striking differences were
between Orientals and non-Orientals; about half of all Orientals lack a high-activity form of
ALDH which all non-Orientals have. As a direct consequence, these ‘‘deficient” Orientals have
markedly increased alcohol sensitivity (flushing, dysphoria, cardiovascular response). These
enzyme differences are very probably due to a single gene, as are ethnic differences in ADH
variants. For rates of absorption and metabolism, the ethnic differences probably have a poly

genic basis.

The problems of alcohol use and
abuse (e.g., Moser, 1980) continue to
generate much interest and research.
Although it has long been known that
there are marked differences among individual Caucasians in alcohol use, responses, and abuse, mean differences
between ethnic groups (races) were not
objectively studied until about the middle of this century (see Jellinek, 1960).
The first clear demonstration of racial
differences in alcohol sensitivity, documenting the much greater average sensitivity of Orientals, was given by Wolff in
1972. A review of racial differences in
alcohol metabolism (Reed, 1978) also
suggested differences. A brief general

review by Reed (1981) confirmed the
greater sensitivity of Orientals.

Study of ethnic differences in alcohol
“‘responses”’ (use, physiological and
psychological responses, abuse) is
worthwhile in itself for increasing our
general understanding. It is also worthwhile for furthering our genetic understanding of alcohol responses (AR).
Differences in AR may be due to environmental differences (E) between ethnic groups, to genetic differences (G),
or, most likely, to a combination of environmental and genetic differences
(E + G). Formally, ethnic group differences are between-group differences
and are the logical complement of the

196

within-group (e.g., within Caucasians)
differences among individuals which
have been more extensively studied. E
and G may contribute to both types of
differences in AR.

Recent large-scale surveys of genetic
diversity within and between races (Nei
and Roychoudhury, 1982) have demonstrated that (1) there is great genetic variability (e.g., about half of structural loci
are polymorphic, i.e., a locus has two or
more common alleles) in all races and
that (2) most of this genetic variability is
within races, not between races. The implications for AR of this genetic diversity are important: Many AR directly or
indirectly depend on specific enzymes or
proteins—direct gene products—which
should reflect this diversity. We therefore have strong a priori reasons for expecting some genetic contribution to
many within-race differences in AR and
also to a number of between-race differences. It is worth noting here that genetic differences between human groups
within major races, measured as “genetic distance,” are small for Caucasian
groups, considerably larger for Oriental
groups, and very large for North and
South American Indian groups. Among
the three major races, the genetic dis
-tance between African Blacks and Cau
casians or Orientals is larger than between Caucasians and Orientals (Nei
and Roychoudhury, 1982).

This review of ethnic differences in
AR is based primarily on a literature review of papers published in the interval
1978-84, supplemented by some earlier
works. It includes the following nine
areas of AR: consumption rate, absorption rate (from the digestive system),
metabolism rate, alcohol dehydrogenase variants (isozymes), acetaldehyde dehydrogenase variants, alcohol

sensitivity (facial flushing and dysphoria), cardiovascular changes, psychological changes, and alcohol abuse. For
each area an interpretation of the ethnic
differences in terms of E and G will be
attempted. In general, when E is absent,
as in isozyme differences, or is small, G
must necessarily explain most or all of
the ethnic differences in AR. In the light
of the preceding discussion, it 1s not surprising that the ethnic differences in
physiological AR are concluded to be
due mainly to G. On the other hand,
some AR, such as consumption rate (as
liters of 100 per cent ethanol per capita
per year), seem to be largely due to E.
For some AR there are few data on ethnic differences and no firm conclusions
are warranted.

REVIEW OF NINE ALCOHOL
RESPONSES

1. ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION RATE
(ACR)

There is considerable difficulty in
making comparisons of the alcohol consumption rate (ACR) values of different
groups, beginning with the fact that, at
least in the United States, self-reported
ACR seriously underreports the true
ACR (Munch et al., 1981). Further, the
reported values have meaning only in
regions where alcohol is freely available, without widespread religious,
moral, or economic restrictions. International comparisons are further restricted to those countries with welldeveloped national _ statistics.
Consequently, the only international
ethnic comparison available appears to
be among developed countries of the
Western World and Japan; the latest
year for comparison was 1978 (Table 1).

“Liters of 100 per cent ethanol per capita, all ages.

In liters of 100 per cent ethanol per capita, including all ages, the Western consumption ranged from 16.0 (France) to
7.1 (United Kingdom). The U.S. consumption was 8.5, whereas that for Japan was 5.2.

There are many more data from special surveys within the U.S.A. and Canada. In the U.S.A., male Caucasians
drink somewhat more (0.49 oz. ethanol/
day) than male non-Caucasians (0.36,
mainly black), while male and female
Caucasians are less often abstainers
(36.8 per cent) than are male and female
blacks (44.2 per cent) (Munch et al.,
1981). North American Indians vary
greatly in their alcohol use, with some,
such as Utes and Ojibwa, considerably
exceeding the total U.S. percentages for
the respective proportions of current
drinkers and “heavy drinkers” (80 per
cent, 26 per cent for Utes; 84 per cent,
42 per cent for Ojibwa; 67 per cent, 9
per cent for all U.S.A.), while the percentages for other tribes are similar to
(Standing Rock Sioux) or lower than
(Navajo) the total U.S. percentages
(May, 1982).

Hawaii (island of Oahu) is by far the
most intensively surveyed region of the

U.S.A. with respect to alcohol consumption. Two large-scale surveys (Kolonel, 1979; Schwitters et al., 1982) and
one small-scale survey (N = 103; Reed
and Hanna, submitted for publication)
all agree in finding that, among Oahu
residents, Americans of Caucasian ancestry drink more than Americans of
Japanese ancestry, who, in turn, drink
more than Americans of Chinese ancestry. Reed and Hanna found that the respective mean grams of ethanol consumed per week were 136, 73, and 41 in
their sample of healthy young adult
males (mean ages 26-28 years).

Interpretation.—The limited, sometimes unreliable data do show ethnic differences in consumption rates. Without
additional information, however, it
seems impossible to ascribe any of these
differences (outside Hawaii) to genetic
differences. The data given below onenzyme differences, however, do allow
some genetic interpretation of the data
from Hawaii.

2. ABSORPTION RATE

Three studies have compared North
American Caucasians with nonCaucasians for the mean time to reach
peak blood alcohol concentration
(BAC) or time to peak ear lobe flushing
following a test drink; one study compared members of three racial groups in
Hawaii (Table 2). All subjects in all
studies were fasting. The Hawaiian
study used a dose of 0.79 g ethanol/kg
body weight; the North American studies used doses of 0.52 or 0.53 g/kg. In the
North American studies, the nonCaucasians reached peak values significantly sooner, indicating faster absorption. Two of these studies involved
North American Indians; one involved
Chinese residents in the U.S.A. In conDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

198 Reed

trast, no significant differences in mean
time to peak were found among the
three racial groups in the Hawaiian
study.

Interpretation.—There appear to be
clear racial differences in the North
American studies. This conclusion
seems reasonable since a study of young
adult German males found a marked genetic effect on absorption rate (Kopun
and Propping, 1977). Because the Hawaiian study does not show racial differences in absorption time, possibly due to
small sample sizes, a final conclusion
must await further data. Fast absorption
may have “practical”? consequences because, for a given test drink, it will usually produce a higher peak BAC than
does slow absorption (e.g., see Table 2).

3. METABOLISM RATE

The rate of metabolism of ethanol (to
acetaldehyde) of different groups is best

Social Biology

measured as the rate, 8, of disappearance of alcohol from the blood following
a test dose (Reed and Kalant, 1977;
Wilson and Erwin, 1983). Be is commonly used, i.e., mg ethanol/d1 x hr.
There are many studies reporting Bg estimates in Caucasians, and a number in
non-Caucasian ethnic groups. Table 3
gives Bg values from a variety of studies
on Caucasian males, both selected and
unselected for usual alcohol consumption. There is a definite trend for Bg to
increase from a mean of about 13 in nondrinkers to a mean of about 17 or 18 in
heavy drinkers. There is a notable variation in Bg among individuals (within
studies). Table 4 gives the available Be
estimates for racially defined nonCaucasians. (The estimate obtained by
Fenna et al., 1971, in Western Canada is
omitted here because that study differs
from all others in techniques—use of intravenous infusion, for example—and

dians (Amerinds), however, are all relatively high. Weighted means for these
Indians are presented in Table 5 and
compared with the range of Caucasian
means. Both the mean based on the
three U.S. Indian studies (19.2) and the
mean based on these three plus the one
Canadian Indian study (19.3) exceed the
range of Caucasian means (12.5-18).
The group of three and the group of four
Amerind studies both differ significantly
among themselves in means.

Interpretation.—There appears to be
asmall but real difference between Caucasians and North American Indians in
mean Bg values, with the Indians having
higher alcohol metabolism rates. No
other clear racial differences are apparent. In the absence of obvious environmental differences which could explain
this difference in Bgo (differences in alcohol consumption have already been
shown to be insufficient), genetic differences seem implied. This seems reasonable since appreciable genetic determination of Beg, within Caucasians, has
already been demonstrated (Kopun and
Propping, 1977).

of the metabolism of ethanol, producing
acetaldehyde. ADH 1s a dimer selected
from polypeptide chains produced by
five different structural loci: ADA;,
ADA), .. . ADHs. Only the first three
loci are physiologically important in
normal humans. They produce polypeptide chains that unite to form homodimers (identical chains) or heterodimers
(different chains) (Smith et al., 1973).
Of these three loci, only ADH, and
ADH; show polymorphisms; that is, at
these two gene loci there are at least two
common alleles (genes) (Ricciardi et al.,
1983). The variation at the ADH; locus
is between the “usual” (in Europeans)
and “atypical” isozymes. At the ADH;
locus, the genotypes for the ADH} and
ADH; alleles (producing phenotypes
ADH;, ADH3-} and ADH2) are all
common. Table 6 presents frequency
data on these ADH variants (isozymes)
in various populations. There is a
marked difference among populations
in frequency of the “atypical”? ADH),
from only 2.5—11.1 per cent in Western
Europeans to 84-91 per cent in Orientals. The ADH; phenotypes differ between English and Chinese, ADH} being significantly (two-tail probability)
higher in the Chinese group. The phenotype frequencies for ADH, and
ADH; do not differ between normal and
alcoholic English.

there are no known physiological consequences in vivo of having different
ADH phenotypes (Ricciardi et al.,
1983).

5. ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE
VARIANTS (ISOZYMES)

Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)
catalyzes the second step in alcohol metabolism, from acetaldehyde to acetate.
ALDH exists in at least five different
isozymes whose structural bases are now
being investigated (Ricciardi et al.,
1983). One of these, ALDH-I (Goedde
et al., 1983), has the highest activity
(lowest K,,) and also shows a marked
polymorphism (present or absent) in
Orientals and related ethnic groups.
Other groups all seem to have ALDH-I.
Table 7 presents the available data on
ALDH-I deficiency. No persons lacking
ALDH-I were found among Europeans

 

or Africans, but the eastern Asiatic
groups have deficiency rates of 8-57 per
cent. A South American Indian group
seems to have a high frequency of deficiency, whereas a North American Indian group (Oklahoma) has a low deficiency rate. It is noteworthy that of the
two groups of alcoholics studied, the
data on English alcoholics agree with
those on the normal English population
in showing no deficiency, but the frequency in Japanese alcoholics (2.3 per
cent) differs markedly from that in the
normal Japanese population (44 per
cent).

Interpretation.—The _ contrasts
among no ALDH-I deficiency in Europeans or Africans, up to 54 per cent deficiency rates in Oriental populations,
and as much as 69 per cent deficiency in
South American Indians are the greatest
racial differences in alcohol response or
metabolism so far reported. ALDH-I
deficiency is almost certainly due to a
mutant variant in the structural gene for
the enzyme. Unlike the ADH polymorphisms, this ALDH polymorphism has
major consequences for alcohol use and
abuse, which will be discussed below.

6. FACIAL FLUSHING AND SYMPTOMS OF
DYSPHORIA

The first clearly established racial difference in alcohol response was demonstrated by Wolff in 1972. He showed
that Orientals often, but Caucasians
rarely, showed marked facial flushing
and various symptoms of discomfort
(dysphoria) after one or two drinks of alcohol. Several studies have confirmed
and extended this finding; these are
shown in Table 8. The flushing rate in
Caucasians, as observed by an investigator (not self-reported), is 3~12 per cent,
whereas in Orientals it is 57-85 per cent.
Rates for dysphoria in the two groups
are also quite different: 0-9 per cent in
Caucasians and 26-53 per cent in Orientals. There also appears to be appreciable flushing in some American Indians.

Interpretation.—Goedde et al. (1979)
proposed that persons deficient in
ALDH-I would have elevated levels of

blood acetaldehyde (AcH) after drinking which would produce flushing and
dysphoria. The known pharmacological
properties of ACH made this hypothesis
seem plausible, and it was confirmed by
a study in Japan (Mizoi et al., 1983).
This study of 29 men with ALDH-I and
39 without ALDH-I showed that, aftera
dose of 0.4 g ethanol/kg (about two
drinks), the blood AcH was much
higher (mean 33 2M) in deficient men
than in normal men (mean 2 4M). The
deficient men also showed large mean
changes in heart rate (increase), in diastolic blood pressure (decrease), and in
plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine
(increases), whereas the normal men
showed little or no mean changes in
these responses. All deficient men
showed facial flushing; no normal men
did.

These results also seem to explain the
very low rate of ALDH-I deficiency in
Japanese alcoholics. Most deficient JapDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

*Observation by investigator

’One or more of “hot stomach,” palpitations, tachycardia, muscle weakness, dizziness, sleepiness

anese would become sick before drinking enough alcohol to become dependent on alcohol. The normal Japanese,
however, like most Europeans, can
drink enough to become dependent if
their social and/or psychological and/or
physiological situation encourages such
drinking. ALDH-I deficiency in Orientals also seems to explain the relatively
low consumption rates in Orientals:
Those lacking ALDH-I often find the
consequences of drinking unpleasant
and so tend to drink little, or not at all.

Together, these observations on the
variation in AcH metabolism due to
ALDH-I being present or absent, and
the consequences for the individuals,
constitute the clearest racial variation in
alcohol response.

7. CARDIOVASCULAR RESPONSES

Changes in cardiovascular (CV) parameters, such as heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic
blood pressure (DBP), after consuming

alcohol have long been recognized. Beginning ten years ago, several studies
have shown consistent differences between Caucasians and Orientals (usually Chinese and Japanese) in their CV
responses, the latter showing greater increases in HR and greater decreases in
SBP and DBP (review in Reed and
Hanna, submitted for publication). As
noted in the section above, most, if not
all, of these racial differences can now
be ascribed to the ALDH-I deficiency
present in about half of all Orientals.
There appear to be no published data on
CV responses of other racial groups.
The published data on CV responses
give group means of changes in CV parameters; individual changes are not reported. Because this almost universal
reliance on group means (of changes)
has generated the false impression (e.g.,
Naitoh, 1972; DeLuca, 1981) that there
is little within-group variation in such
CV responses, it may be useful to report
here the responses to alcohol of individ

uals within three racial groups. These
are data on normal young adult male
Americans residing on Oahu, Hawaii
(Reed and Hanna, submitted for publication). There were 46 of European ancestry, 30 of Japanese ancestry, and 27
of Chinese ancestry, ranging in age from
20 and 38 years (means: 25.6 to 27.7
years). After fasting, they received 0.59
g ethanol/kg (about three drinks) and
were tested for HR, SBP, and DBP before and 1, 2, and 3 hours after drinking.
Figure 1 gives the individual changes
(from baseline) in these three CV responses, at 1 hour post-alcohol, for each
of the three groups. Japanese and Chinese do not differ in mean responses;
when pooled as ‘“‘Orientals,”’ they show
the previously reported differences
from Caucasians, and the HR and DBP
differ significantly. The new result here
is the great within-group variability in
each response in each race and the fact
that this variability in Europeans is
about as large as in Orientals. Repeated
measures analysis of variance (Reed and
Hanna, submitted for publication)
shows that this variability among individuals (within-races— is very significant. Another important result is that
there is no clear division of the Japanese
or Chinese distributions into two subpopulations.

Interpretation.—The greater mean
CV responses of Orientals to alcohol appear to be largely, if not entirely, due to
the lack of the ALDH-I isozyme in
about half of the population, as discussed in the preceding section. This
polymorphism for ALDH-I predicts
that there would have been two populations of Orientals in the Hawaiian study,
those with and those without this isozyme, and that this might be seen in the
distributions of CV changes. Figure 1
does not show this, however. Within

Social Biology

each ALDH-I class there apparently is
still considerable variability in CV response (also shown in the Japanese data
of Mizoi et al., 1983) so that there is an
appreciable overlap between the two
subpopulations. The marked variability
in CV responses of Europeans, all of
whom (almost certainly: see above)
have ALDH-I, makes this interpretation plausible. The interesting question
of whether Orientals with ALDH-I differ from Europeans in their CV alcohol
responses has yet to be tested.

8. PSYCHOLOGICAL RESPONSES

There has been very little work done
in this area; a search of the literature revealed only two relevant studies. Farris
and Jones (19785) studied 15 Caucasian
women and 15 Indian women in Oklahoma for alcohol’s effects on memory.
Both groups were equally affected.
Sanders et al. (1980), in Hawaii, studied
40 males of Japanese ancestry and 20
males of European ancestry for psychological effects of alcohol. The only difference (P<0.05) was that Japanese
felt less fatigued after drinking. There
was no attempt to relate this finding to
the ALDH-I or facial flushing status of
the Japanese.

There are too few studies in this area
to draw any conclusions.

9, ALCOHOL ABUSE (INCLUDING
‘* ALCOHOLISM ’’)

This is another very difficult area for
making comparisons between ethnic
groups. The main problems are regional
differences in definitions of ‘“‘alcohol
abuse” and lack of data, “reliable” or
not, from the “less developed” countries. Only two types of comparisons
could be made; these are shown in Tables 9 and 10. Table 9 presents data from
representative “developed” countries

the percentage of admissions to psychiatric units (hospital, clinic, etc.) among
males who have a diagnosis of ‘‘alcoholism.’’ The percentages for Western
countries range from 37 in France to 9.0
in the U.S.A.; for Japan and Thailand,
they are 6.6 and 4.5 respectively. Table

alcohol-related problems in U.S. Indicans with those of the U.S. general popuJation. In each of four categories, the Ingins have a much higher relative rate of
such problems. A similar disparity also

Even so, it may be meaningful to note
here that the cirrhosis rates for Japan,
Singapore, and Thailand were 19.7, 9.3,
and 7.7, respectively, per hundred thousand (Moser, 1980).

that rates of alcohol abuse are higher in
the Western developed countries than in
Japan and Thailand. This agrees with
the lower consumption in Japan (see Table 1) and also with the existence of a
high frequency of “alcohol sensitive”
ALDH-I deficient persons. In fact,
ALDHE-I deficiency in Japan raises the
problem of why the alcohol consumption and the rate of cirrhosis there are as
high as they are.

Vol. 32, No. 3-4

Undoubtedly there are other national differences, but we lack the necessary data to show them.

The comparison between American
Indians and the general population of
the U.S.A. in rates of alcohol-related
problems is considerably more convincing. The alcohol problems of U.S. Indians, as a whole, have long been recognized (May, 1982), and the data in Table
10 illustrate this. At the same time, the
great variation among Amerinds in alcohol use and abuse must be noted. Some
groups, such as Navajos, are relatively
abstemious (May, 1982). Nevertheless,
there is no doubt of an overall, relatively
high level of alcohol problems among
American (and Canadian) Indians.

There may be other ethnic differences in rates of alcohol abuse, e.g., involving U.S. Blacks and Hispanics, but
there appear to be no recent data on
other ethnic comparisons.

DISCUSSION

The overall finding of this review of
the nine areas of alcohol response is
that, whenever there are enough data
(all areas except psychological responses), there is evidence for differences among ethnic groups. Among
these racial differences, all show some
evidence that genetic differences are a
factor in producing the response difference. The degree of genetic involvement, however, varies widely, from 100
per cent in the case of the enzymes
ADH and ALDH, to a much lower proportion (in non-Orientals) in the case of
alcohol consumption rates, for example,
where the environmental factors of religion, moral views, and economics are
obviously of great importance. In the
very important area of alcohol abuse,

the only direct evidence for genetic involvement is in the European-Oriental
difference. Here the lower ‘‘alcoholism” rate in the latter, in Japanese at
least, can be understood as a simple consequence of the alcohol sensitivity of individuals who lack the ALDH-I isozyme. No such clear conclusion can be
drawn in the case of U.S. Indiangeneral population differences, especially since the Indians vary greatly
among themselves and their frequently
unfavorable social environment may often encourage alcohol abuse. It should
not be surprising that clear-cut evidence
of a role for heredity in alcohol abuse
was not found in this survey of the literature. Such evidence, within Caucasians,
has only recently been available from
large-scale adoption studies (e.g.,
Cloninger et al., 1981) that control for
the important environmental effects of
the childhood home.

Except for the enzyme differences
(and their direct consequences, such as
flushing) which are almost certainly due
to allelic variation at an autosomal locus, the modes of inheritance of the various alcohol responses considered above
are unknown. These responses are continuously distributed, quantitative traits
and, by analogy with better-known
quantitative genetic traits, we may reasonably expect them to be determined
by a number of genetic loci, each with a
relatively small effect (1.e., polygenic inheritance). Such a conclusion seems especially sure when considering physiological responses such as blood pressure
or heart rate change. Blood pressure in
humans is known to be under strong polygenic control (Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971), and alcohol may modulate
this genetic effect. A study in mice directly showed quantitative genetic deDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

termination of alcohol-induced change
in heart rate (Reed, 1977).

In conclusion, it seems appropriate to
note that in focusing on ethnic
differences—group differences—we
have (intentionally) ignored the much
greater genetic variation within (ethnic)
groups. About 90 per cent of the genetic
variability of our species is within racial
groups (Nei and Roychoudhury, 1982).
All of the between-group differences in
this review can also be found within ethnic groups. It is useful to study and un

derstand between-group differences, in
alcohol responses and other traits. It is
essential, however, to place such differences, when they exist, in the wider context of the total variation in genetic and
environmental factors that affect the
traits under consideration.
