Brief Reports

Reliability Versus Validity

of Tests Used in Genetic Identification

An ever-increasing use of genetic
traits for the identification of suspects
and evidence in criminal cases has
brought a corresponding increase in
challenges to the use of the test results.
The ensuing arguments have, unfortunately, produced a blurring of two essential aspects of any test, namely, its
reliability versus its validity.

Reliability of a test refers to the
consistency or reproducibility of the
test results under a set of prescribed
conditions. Validity refers to whether
the test actually measures or specifies
the trait in question. Experts in a field
may generally agree that a test has a
very high reliability but may seriously
disagree as to its validity. IO tests are
the prime examples of this disagreement among experts. Whereas there is
little debate that the tests give consistent and reproducible results, there is a
serious question raised as to whether
such tests actually measure the intelligence of individuals.

In forensic analysis, where testing is
performed to identify the source of
biological evidence, problems of test
reliability versus validity also exist.
One example, taken from serology, involves the blood types A, B, AB, and
O. By the use of a standardized procedure, the designation of a person as

blood type A by one laboratory can
and will be confirmed by all other laboratories properly performing the test.
Hence there is no challenge to the reliability of the test. However, it has
been known for some time that there
are at least two different A alleles.
These alleles are A, and A,, both of
which react positively with anti-A serum. A blood type A individual can
be either a homozygote or a heterozygote and could have any one of the
following five genotypes: A,A,, A A>,
A,A>, A,O, A,O. It is also clear that a
similar uncertainty of genotype occurs
in a test result of blood type AB. If a
standardized procedure is used which
is capable of identifying the A antigen
but not the A, or A, subtype, the test
is not valid for genetically identifying
those who are blood type A or AB.
Another example of this problem
involves the use of the HLA DQAI1
(alpha) gene. In many forensic situations where only very small amounts of
the perpetrator’s blood or semen are
available, a portion of the HLA DQA1
gene is amplified using the Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR). The amplified
DNA section is then exposed to a total
of 7 probes which identify specific sections of the PCR product. These sections are then usually considered as

“alleles” of the HLA DQALI locus.
However, as stated in a recent report
of the World Health Organization
Nomenclature Committee for Factors
of the HLA System (Bodmer, et al.,
1995), there are 16 identifiable alleles
at the HLA DOA! gene.

Table 1 lists the 16 alleles and indicates which ones react positively to
each of the probes. There are only two
probes that actually identify individual
alleles. The other probes are not valid
indicators of a person’s genotype.

The unintended potential serious
consequences of using “probe identification” as “genetic identification” has
recently been documented (Salazar et
al., 1994). It involved a rape case in
which the sperm cells obtained from a
vaginal swab of the victim and blood
samples taken from two suspects were
all typed by the probes as 3,4 (4 was a
designation that resulted from using an
earlier version of the test kit in which
the #4 probe had a binding specificity
that is common to both the present 4.1
and 4.2/4.3 probes). However, additional testing procedures of the PCR
product showed that in the case of the
#4 probe designation, the sperm cells
were 0401 whereas both suspects were
0501. Clearly neither suspect could
have been the source of the sperm
cells.

From the foregoing discussion and
examples, it is apparent that where individual identification is critical (discovery of a child who may have been
kidnapped when a baby many years
earlier; burial of body parts of victims
of a massive explosion; establishing
family relationships in claims on an estate; linking a suspect to evidence in a
violent crime), both the reliability and
the validity of the genetic tests used
must be carefully evaluated.
