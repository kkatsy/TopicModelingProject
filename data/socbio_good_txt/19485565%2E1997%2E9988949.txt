ABSTRACT: In the United States, national health status data pertaining to Asian and Pacific Islander (API) Americans are rarely disaggregated. By aggregating API data, however, the poor
health status of some API groups is often masked by the favorable health status of others. The
purpose of this paper is two-fold: (1) to compare mortality rates of the five major ethnic groups
in Hawaii (Caucasians, Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, and Hawaiians) and (2) to explore methodological issues related to comparative studies of API health indicators. Standardized and agespecific mortality rates and 95 per cent confidence intervals for major causes of death were estimated for 1990 based on Hawaii vital records and population data. In general, death rates were
highest for Hawaiians and lowest for Japanese and Chinese, illustrating the importance of API
data disaggregation and suggesting that special attention be paid to improving the health of
Hawaiians. Methodologically, the study demonstrated that, while some compromises in analysis
are required, legitimate comparisons across API groups can be made if data sets are available.

Investigators of Asian and Pacific Islander (API) Americans have been calling
for the disaggregation of API-associated
data for almost two decades, yet, due to
relatively small numbers of API Americans, aggregation remains a common
practice in demography and _ health.
Hawaii, with its large number and proportion of API groups, allows disaggregation
of at least four major API groups—Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, and Hawaiians—although methodological issues are
still of concern. The purpose of this paper
is two-fold: (1) to compare 1990 mortality
rates of four major API groups in Hawai
with Caucasians and (2) to explore
methodological issues related to comparative studies of health indicators across
small ethnic groups.

Taken as a whole, the Asian and Pacific Islander (API) American population
is the most rapidly growing ethnic category in the United States. While API

Americans are often discussed en masse,
the API label, in fact, encompasses over
30 distinct cultural groups. For example,
Asian Americans include third- and
fourth-generation Japanese Americans,
well-educated and English-speaking Chinese immigrants from Hong Kong, their
less Westernized cousins from mainland
China, and non-English speaking refugees
from the countries that comprised Indochina. The Pacific Islander group includes Hawaiians, who are indigenous to
the Hawaiian islands, as well as recent
immigrants from Samoa, Tonga, and Micronesia (Takeuchi and Young, 1994).
Although rapidly growing, API Americans still account for a small percentage
of the total U.S. population (about 3 per
cent), numbering about. 7.3 million in
1990 (Takeuchi and Young, 1994). Many
state and national surveys tend to combine data from these disparate API
groups. When combined, the data suggest

213

214

that API Americans are healthier than the
general population in the United States,
and API Americans have thus been referred to as the “model minority” (Tanjasiri et al., 1995). There is evidence,
however, that this “lumping” of different
ethnic groups into an API category results
in the masking of the poorer health status
of some groups by the better health status
of others. For example, previous studies
have suggested that age-standardized
mortality rates for Chinese, Japanese, and
Filipinos are below those of Caucasians,
while cancer mortality rates for Hawailans are substantially higher than those
for Caucasians, Chinese, Japanese, and
Filipinos (Gardner, 1994; Lin-Fu, 1988;
Yu and Liu, 1992).

In addition, API American mortality estimates for the United States have been
questioned due to problems with the data.
First, API Americans may be_ undercounted. While the U.S. Bureau of the
Census estimated a 2.7 undercount of API
in the 1990 census, a study in New York’s
Chinatown estimated an 18 per cent undercount by the census (Sung, 1991). Second,
API respondents are usually undersampled in national studies, which may require that data be aggregated across years
to build numbers. For example, Liu and Yu
(1985) pooled 3 years of National Health
Interview Survey data (1976-78) to yield
stable estimates; still, they noted serious
problems with this method. Undersampling is also an issue for longitudinal
public health studies on Asian Pacific populations, where small absolute numbers in
some categories reduce statistical power
to detect significant over-time changes
(Takeuchi and Young, 1994; Yu and Liu,
1994). Third is the issue of differential
classification of ethnicity over time and
across studies and states. To illustrate, an

Braun et al.

Social Biology

examination of linked birth and infantdeath files from 1983 through 1985 revealed inconsistencies between birth and
death data, with error rates as high as 33
per cent for Chinese, 49 per cent for Japanese, and 78 per cent for Filipinos (Hahn et
al., 1992). Another study, which tested
agreement of demographic data items collected by the census with death certificates,
found that only 224 of the individuals in
the sample were classified as API on both
documents; 33 who were classified as API
in the census were Caucasian on the death
record and another 12 who were Caucasian
in the census were API at death (Sorlie et
al., 1992). In addition, the National Center
for Health Statistics (NCHS) has changed
the way race is classified and statistics are
reported. For example, the race classification procedure changed in 1969 to assign a
respondent of mixed race to the first race
listed; prior to this change, respondents
with a mix that included black were always
coded black. In addition, mortality data for
Filipinos and Other Asians or Pacific Islanders were shown for the first time in
1979, and for Hispanics in 1984 (NCHS,
1994). Taken together, these constraints
can lead to inaccurate estimates of rates
and faulty comparisons (Hahn, 1992; Hahn
and Stroup, 1994; Osborne and Feit, 1992).

In response to these problems, researchers who are concerned with improving our knowledge of the health status of
API groups have recommended that federal agencies (1) expand and standardize
API race/ethnic classification, (2) oversample API populations in national surveys, (3) develop more culturally appropriate survey measures, and (4) provide funds
to the five states in which 68 per cent of all
API live (California, Hawaii, New York,
Illinois, and Texas) to support a thorough
collection and analyses of data on their

API populations (Tanjasiri et al., 1995; Yu
and Liu, 1992).

Looking at state-based estimates, the
Asian American Health Forum’s (1990)
estimate of crude mortality rates for API
groups in California represents one of the
few available. While they found large mortality differences among API groups, the
rates were not age-standardized and differences may be due partially to differences
in age structures among the API groups.
For example, the high death rates found
for Japanese Americans in California may
be an artifact of an older age structure for
the Japanese group, most of whom are descendants of immigrants from the last century. Similarly, the relative low death rate
for the Vietnamese group may be due to
the fact that this group just started immigrating in 1975 and boasts few elders
(Min, 1995).

The State of Hawaii has collected and
analyzed vital statistics by ethnicity for
almost a century and has found differences in mortality and life expectancy
among the state’s major ethnic groups.
Although methodological issues are also
of concern in Hawaii, the state has instituted a number of controls to assure the
integrity of its vital records and the construction of mortality rates (see Methods). The state also boasts relatively large
numbers of residents of API descent.
Analyses of 1970 and 1980 surveillance
data suggested that leading causes of
death were similar across groups (heart
disease, cancer, and stroke), but that mortality rates were highest for Hawaiians,
intermediate for Caucasians and Filipinos, and lowest for Chinese and Japanese (Gardner, 1984; Johnson, 1989). In
this study, 1990 mortality rates for these
five groups were compared to see if ethnic differences persisted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Even with relatively desirable data for
API health research in Hawati, we still
encountered data problems, including
small numbers for certain ethnic groups
by cause of death and by age, fluctuations
in data across years, inconsistency in ethnicity coding in various data sources, and
changes in ethnicity definitions and disease classifications over time. Methodological steps taken to overcome these
problems are summarized here.

The death data were derived from
Hawaii computer files of death records in
the vital statistics system. Data were requested by gender, ethnicity, age, and
cause of death by International Classification of Disease (ICD) code. The five
major ethnic groups included in our
analysis were Caucasian, Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian, and Japanese. Of the
state’s population of 1,108,229 in 1990,
about 26 per cent were Caucasian, 23 per
cent were Japanese, 19 per cent were
Hawaiian, 15 per cent were Filipino, and
6 per cent were Chinese (Hawaii Department of Health, 1991). Smaller groups
were omitted from the analysis, including
African-Americans (2 per cent), Koreans
(1 per cent), and several other groups
which each account for less than 1 per
cent of the population, e.g., Vietnamese,
Laotian, Thai, Samoan, Micronesian, and
Tongan. For analysis, death data were
grouped in 10-year age intervals with an
exception of the first two age groups (<1,
1-4, 5-14, 15-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54,
55-64, 65-74, 75-84, and 85+). Grouping data into 10-year, rather than 5-year,
intervals was necessary due to small
numbers in some age groups for some
ethnicities. However, we required at least
this many age categories to compensate

216

for the vastly different age structures
among ethnic groups. For example, while
Japanese comprise 23 per cent of the total
population, they account for 40 per cent
of the population age 60 and over. On the
other hand, Hawaiians, which comprise
19 per cent of the total population, account for only 7 per cent of individuals
60 and over (Hawaii Executive Office on
Aging, 1995). We also combined several
ICD categories to achieve reasonable
numbers for each cell, thus providing
rates for death from all causes, from all
heart diseases, and all malignant neoplasms. To deal with death data fluctuations year to year we used 5 years of data
around the decade to calculate the average number of deaths for the decade. For
example, for 1990, we obtained death
data from 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, and
1992 and took the mean. As in other
states, cause of death is certified by the
attending physician; the remainder of the
death certificate, including ethnicity, is
completed by the funeral director (Hahn
and Stroup, 1994; Rosenberg, 1989).
Number of deaths by gender and major
cause for 1990 are shown in Table 1.
Population data were based on the U.S.
census but adjusted according to the ethnic
distribution obtained through the state’s
own surveillance system (which collects
more detailed data on ethnicity than does
the U.S. census) and smoothed for seasonal
fluctuations by a procedure developed by
the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii
(Wilken, 1994). Hawaii’s Health Survey,
established in 1969, is modeled after the
U.S. National Health Survey and, in 1990,
obtained data from a 2 per cent sample of
households. In it, a respondent’s ethnicity
is determined through an algorithm based
on the ethnicity of one’s parents (up to two
ethnicities per parent). If all four parental

Braun et al.

Social Biology

codes are the same, that ethnicity is assigned. If a person is of mixed ethnicity
and Hawaiian is mentioned, the person is
classified as Hawaiian. If a person is of
mixed ethnicity and Hawaiian is not mentioned, then the person is assigned the
first ethnicity mentioned, which is considered the ethnicity that predominates.
This method differs from that used by the
U.S. census and results in a significantly
different count for some ethnicities. For example, 30 per cent fewer Hawaiians are
counted by the census compared to the
state’s surveillance method (U.S. Bureau of
the Census, 1992). Because the Hawaii
Health Survey method better matches the
classification practice for the death certificate, it was chosen as the denominator over
the U.S. census data (Yang et al., 1996).
Population data for the five ethnic groups
by gender and age strata for 1990 are displayed in Table 2.

We calculated both the standardized
(to the 1940 population) and age-specific
mortality rates, which were expressed per
100,000. The 95 per cent confidence intervals were estimated using a method
developed by Mantel that is appropriate
for poisson-type distributions such as
death (Haenszel et al., 1962).

We originally intended to present mortality data for the major ethnic groups
back to the turn of the century. However,
our plan was hindered by three methodological concerns. First, classification of
disease, through the ICD system, has
changed over the century. Second, classification of ethnicity changed over time.
Prior to statehood, territorial census takers assessed ethnicity through discussion
with the respondent, recording the predominant ethnicity. When the federal census procedure was adopted, individuals
were forced to choose a single ethnic catDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

egory. A history of discriminatory practices against Hawaiians led many who had
been classified as Hawaiian in earlier
counts to classify themselves as another
ethnicity. This resulted in dramatically and
unrealistically low numbers of Hawaiians
in the 1970 census count, and was eventually termed the “paper genocide” of the
Hawaiian people (Burch, 1975). The
method of classifying ethnicity used by
the Hawaii Health Survey is similar to the
pre-statehood method in that a respondent
is encouraged to identify all blood lines.
Meanwhile, incentives for declaring one’s
ethnicity began changing again in the
1970’s, with anti-discrimination policies
and a growing tolerance of diversity.
Specifically for Hawaiians, local sovereignty movements and programs that gave

Hawaiians increased access to education
and land have resulted in a growing respect and declaration of Hawaiian heritage
(Blaisdell and Mokuau, 1991). Although
these issues precluded a century-long
look, we did extend our analysis by applying our methodology to the 1980 data, as
there were no major changes between
these two decades. Because the ethnicage-gender-specific mortality rates were
similar in 1980 and 1990, both in magnitude and ranking, the 1980 data are not
presented here.

malignant neoplasms are shown in Table
3. For all causes of death and heart disease, death rates for males were significantly higher than those for females in all
five ethnic groups; however, for malignant neoplasms, death rates for males
were significantly higher than for females
only among Japanese. Comparing ethnic
groups, standardized mortality rates were
highest for Hawaiians, lowest for the
three Asian groups and intermediate for
Caucasians.

Age-specific mortality rates are displayed graphically in Figure 1 while their
actual values and the associated confidence intervals are shown in Tables 4
through 6. The equations in the last column of each table illustrate the significant
differences in mortality for various ethnic

“groups. For example, “H>CA>CH,FJ”

denotes that the mortality rates for the
Chinese (CH), Filipino (F), and Japanese
(J) did not differ significantly from each
other, but were significantly lower than
rates for Caucasians (CA) and Hawaiians
(H) and, additionally, that the death rate
for Hawaiians was significantly higher
than the rate for Caucasians. A look at
Figure 1 suggests that, in general, ethnic
variations in mortality rates were small
and insignificant in the early age strata
but were significantly, and some cases
dramatically, different in adulthood.

All Cause Mortality Rates.——In general, for both males and females, Hawaiians had significantly higher all-cause
mortality rates than at least one other ethnic group in all age strata from 14-24 to
65-74. Caucasians had the second highest death rates among the five ethnic
groups; in some age strata Caucasian
rates were Statistically similar to those of
Hawaiians while, in others, they were significantly lower than those for Hawaiians

but significantly higher than those for the
three Asian groups. The Chinese and
Japanese groups usually had the lowest
death rates in each age strata. Table 4
provides the actual rates and the intergroup comparative equations for 1990.

Heart Disease Mortality Rates.—In
general, the same pattern is seen for heart
disease mortality rates, with rates highest
for Hawaiians, intermediate for Caucasians, and lowest for the three Asian
groups. Death rates for Hawaiians were
significantly higher than all others only in
the 45-65 age strata. For the 65-84 age
strata, Caucasian and Hawatian death
rates are statistically similar, but both are
significantly higher than rates for one or
more of the three Asian groups. Table 5
provides actual rates and inter-group
comparative equations.

Malignant Neoplasm Mortality Rates.—
For malignant neoplasms, the Native
Hawaiian mortality rates are again highest of the five groups. Caucasian rates are
second highest and the death rates for the
three Asian groups are significantly lower
than the other two groups at several age
strata. Detail 1s provided in Table 6.

DISCUSSION

The findings concur with those reported nationally that Chinese, Japanese,
and Filipino Americans have substantially
lower mortality rates than do Caucasian
Americans and that Hawaiians have high
cancer death rates (Gardner, 1994; LinFu, 1988; Yu and Liu, 1992). Additionally, this study found that Native Hawaiian mortality rates were generally higher
than other groups for heart disease and all
causes of death. These patterns were also
evident in the 1980 death rate comparisons (not shown in tables). Taken toDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

gether, these findings validate the variance in health status among these API
groups and underscore the importance of
looking to states with high proportions of
API to provide estimates of mortality for
specific API subgroups. Implications of
these findings are discussed on several
levels.

First, this study calls attention to
methodological issues confronted in longitudinal and comparative health research
of small ethnic groups, including small
numbers in some categories for certain
ethnic groups; differences in age structures of various populations; inconsistency in definitions of ethnicity and coding in numerators and denominators; and
over-time changes in coding and classification of ethnicity and disease. To com
pensate for known differences in age
structure among major ethnic groups, we
estimated age-standardized rates as well
as age-specific rates for 11 age categories. The latter procedure exacerbated
the problem of small numbers per cell,
requiring us to present only mortality
rates for all causes and two major disease
categories, total heart diseases and all
cancers. (We did not have the statistical
power to demonstrate significance in ethnic differences in rates for other causes of
death.) Because inconsistent definitions
of ethnicity between numerators and denominators can lead to erroneous estimation in mortality levels, our choice of denominator (U.S. census vs. the Hawaii
Health Survey) was crucial. The implications of our choice were consequential,

to use the latter because its ethnicity classification scheme better matched that of

of programs that have provided special
opportunities for education and land
ownership for Hawaiians (Blaisdell and
Mokuau, 1991). Over-time changes in the
classification of disease were also a concer. Thus, this study compromised by
focusing on 1980 and 1990 death rates,
instead of examining the mortality trend
over the century.

Second, this study demonstrates the
usefulness of increased detail when discussing health status of API Americans.
Aggregation of API American statistics
masks the successes of some groups and
problems of others. Upon closer inspection of these groups, investigators are
finding that health status of Chinese,
Japanese, and Filipino Americans may be
better than that of Caucasians (Yu and
Liu, 1994). Although this study showed
few significant differences among these
three Asian groups, and large differences
between these Asian groups and the Native Hawaiian group, this is not to say
that just analyzing Asian Americans separately from Pacific Islanders will suffice.
There is growing evidence that the health
status of other Asian American groups,
like Koreans and South-East Asians, may
be worse than that of Caucasians (Gold,
1992; Min, 1995; Ying and Hu, 1994).
Unfortunately, the absolute numbers of
South-East Asian and Korean residents in
Hawaii were too small for our analysis.

Other studies have also found significant within-group differences when examining ethnicity. In the case of Hawailans, an earlier study by the authors
found significant death rate differences in
mortality rates among full, part, and nonHawaiians, with full Hawaiians exhibiting significantly higher rates than part
Hawaiians (and both full and part Hawaiians exhibiting significantly higher rates

Braun et al.

 

Social Biology

than non-Hawatians) for all causes of
death, heart disease, and malignant neoplasms (Braun, Look et al., 1996; Braun,
Yang et al., 1996). Ethnicity is also confounded by birthplace and current residency. For example, Liu and Yu (1985)
found that among API dwelling in the
United States mortality rates for foreignborn API are significantly higher than
mortality rates for U.S.-born API. Kieffer
and colleagues (1995) found that Hawaiians living in Hawaii had better birth
outcomes (e.g., lower neonatal morbidity and infant mortality) than Hawaiians
living on the U.S. mainland even after
controlling for prenatal care and sociodemographic differences. Ethnicity is often confounded by socioeconomic status
(SES) as well. While the link between low
SES and poor health has been well established (Navarro, 1990; Pappas, 1994), efforts to develop standard definitions and
collection mechanisms for research focused on relationships between health status and socioeconomic status is still in its
infancy (Moss and Krieger, 1995). Taken
together, these considerations suggest that
ethnicity alone is not an ideal independent
variable for health analysis. Future studies
of health status are needed to test the relative impact of SES and other variables
that confound ethnicity (Link and Phelan,
1996).

On the level of health care policy in
Hawaii, the findings indicate that special
attention be given to improving the health
status of Hawaiians, whether the root
cause of their poor health status is ethnicity, SES, or something else. This special
attention would require working with Native Hawatian organizations and leaders
to identify successful intervention strategies and concentrating services in communities where Hawaiians reside. In fact,

Hawaiian-specific programs have been
expanded recently through the enactment
of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act which (1) supports Native Hawaiian Health Systems (providing
health promotion, disease prevention, and
some traditional healing services) on the
major islands (Oahu, Hawaii, Kauai,
Maui, and Molokai) and (2) provides
scholarships to Hawaiians pursuing health
careers (U.S. Congress, 1992). These programs are beginning to address some of
the factors affecting the health status
of Hawaiians, including lack of access
to health services in general, especially
to health promotion services, and lack
of culturally-appropriate health services
delivered by Native Hawaiian providers
who appreciate Native Hawaiian values
and traditions and have also been
trained in Western medicine (Braun,
Yang et al., 1996).

It is uncertain to what extent API mortality rates estimated in Hawaii can be
generalized to API in the general U.S.
population. Still, the present study illustrates the advantages of turning to indi

vidual states with large numbers of API
residents for an analysis of API data. This
study also showed that, although compromises are necessary, mortality rates by
API subgroups can be estimated and interAPI-group differences do exist. As medicine and public health are concerned with
assessing true baselines and reducing discrepancies among groups (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
1991), disaggregation of data by ethnicity
(and factors that confound it) becomes
imperative.
