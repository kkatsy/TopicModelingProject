Abortion is rapidly becoming an imc) portant public issue in Canada. Its legal,
— moral, and political implications are widely
% debated, and many organizations are pressing for liberalization of old abortion laws.
‘In June, 1969, the Canadian Parliament
S passed a controversial series of amendments
‘3 to the Criminal Code of Canada which ap>proved abortions where the mother’s health
Z was seriously endangered by the continuation of a pregnancy. Since then, some increase in therapeutic abortions has been
‘observed in certain communities (Boyce and
3 Osborn, 1970). However the impact of the
‘SS amendments themselves on the incidence
< has been questioned (Veevers, 1971). Ree cently, the Royal Commission on the Status
of Women recommended strongly that
abortions be permitted by a qualified medical practitioner solely on the request of any
women who has been pregnant for 12 weeks
or less or at the request of a woman pregnant for more than 12 weeks if the doctor
is convinced that the continuation of the
pregnancy would endanger the physical or
mental health of the woman, or if there is
a substantial risk that if the child were
born, it would be greatly handicapped
either mentally or physically (Dominion of

35

Canada, 1970). In the light of the above
recommendations and the general change
in social attitudes, further legislation can
be expected in the near future.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

It will be especially appropriate to ascertain at this stage the attitudes of women
directly affected by these laws. While there
have been a limited number of studies in
the United States (Rossi, 1967; Kantner
and Armstrong, 1968; Westoff, Moore, and
Ryder, 1969), they have been practically
nonexistent in Canada. In this paper we
hope to analyze the responses of a sample
of 1,632 married women in metropolitan
Toronto to a series of questions on abortion.
These women were drawn randomly and
were interviewed in early 1968. The questions on abortion were only a few of the
many questions asked as part of a broader
Canadian Family Growth Study covering
many factors associated with fertility and
contraception.

Our interest in abortion also arises from
its possible demographic impact in the next
few years. Countries which have liberalized
abortion have all experienced a sudden
rapid decline in birth rates. Will the decline

36 Balakrishnan et al.

in birth rates in the United States and
Canada be accelerated by liberalization of
abortion laws? Will abortion be used as a
means of birth control, or will it primarily
be used as a means of removing accidental
pregnancy where a birth control method
has failed? In the latter case, what proportion of accidentally pregnant women are
likely to seek abortion? These are some of
the issues of concern for demographers.

A number of questions were asked about
the respondent’s approval of abortion under different situations. The distribution of
responses to these questions are presented
in Table 1.

The responses reveal three patterns. The
women overwhelmingly approved abortion
if mother’s health is endangered, if she is
mentally ill or raped, and if there is a question of deformity of the newborn. They
were somewhat undecided on situations of
severe emotional or economic problems and
were generally opposed if the grounds were
that serious marriage difficulties might ensue, that the woman was not married, or
that a couple simply did not want any
more children.

The cumulative distribution of responses

by number of positive responses is given
below:

Number of positive responses ............
3 45 67 8 9

Cumulative per cent distribution ........
100 92 87 80 72 61 48 36 26 15

The above figures indicate that 92% approved abortion at least for any one reason,
87% at least for any two reasons, and so
on, with 15% approving abortion for all
reasons.

Since an abortion is now legally permitted in Canada only when the mother’s
health is in danger, the above distribution
indicates that 87% are probably for liberalizing the present law.1 The general level
of attitudes of the sample women can be
said to lie somewhere between those of
the Roman-Catholic—affiliated organizations opposed to reform of present laws
and those of Unitarian and Jewish orga
1No question was asked about changing the
present Canadian law. The figure of 87% was derived from the respondents supporting more than
one indication for abortion not permitted by law
at the time. Because of the lack of acceptable
scaleability of the attitude index, the response
patterns do not provide a precise indication of
which items have been accepted or rejected.

toward abortion.

A reminder that attitudes are only a
guide to behavior came in the results of
responses to the following question:

If you should accidentally become pregnant

and already had all the children you want,

do you think you might consider having
an abortion to terminate the pregnancy if
abortion for this reason were legal in

Canada?

Only 18% responded in the affirmative;
yet 28% had approved abortion in this instance in principle as evident in Table 1.

certain action in contrast to expressed
Q readiness to participate in that action was

% tion and action suggests the presence of

.2 attitudes and loyalty to one’s own church
teachings or a fear of the operation itself.

An index measuring the attitude toward
7% liberalizing abortion was developed using
the responses to the nine questions in Table

1. This index is the sum of the positive
‘>,responses and thus can vary from 0 to 9
— for any respondent. The mean of this index
3 for all women was 5.19 with a standard de< viation of 2.78. Construction of the index
2 by simple addition implies equal weight for
A all the questions. The larger the index for

a respondent, the more liberal is her atti
tude toward abortion.

RESULTS

FERTILITY BEHAVIOR, FAMILY PLANNING
PRACTICES AND ATTITUDES
TOWARDS ABORTION

The few studies on attitudes towards
abortion conducted in North America all
show that attitudes toward abortion are
closely related to a person’s religious beliefs and levels of education, income, etc.

Abortion Attitudes in Toronto 37

(see, for example, Westoff et al., 1969, p.
14-16). But how far they are a function of
a woman’s situational factors—such as the
number of children desired or expected, accidental pregnancy history, and contraceptive practice—are less often explored.
However, Westoff et al. (1969, p. 25) did
find in their 1965 national sample of
United States women an inverse relation
between number of children expected and
liberal attitudes toward abortion.

We shall first examine the influence of
situational fertility factors on the attitudes
toward abortion. The mean abortion index
by religion and family-size variables are
presented in Table 2. The general pattern
is toward a less liberal attitude towards
abortion as family size increases. Both for
Catholics and non-Catholics there is an inverse relation between number of children
and liberal attitudes toward abortion after
two children. However, women with no
children or one child are less liberal. It is
possible that these women are mostly either
young women just starting their families or
have problems of sterility or subfecundity,
and in either case are not immediately
concerned with controlling their family size.

It was hypothesized that women who
had failures in planning their families might
well be influenced in their attitudes toward
abortion by this fact. Thus, those women
who had accidental pregnancies resulting in
either unwanted children or children at an
unwanted time might be more likely to
show their frustration by a more liberal
attitude toward abortion. To test this hypothesis, all the women in the sample were
classified according to whether their last
pregnancy was unwanted in terms of number and spacing. The results are presented
in Table 3. Both among Catholics and nonCatholics, those women whose last pregnancy was unwanted were more liberal
toward abortion. Spacing failure does not
seem to affect responses as much as number

failure. Thirty-three per cent of the women
whose last pregnancy was unwanted said
that they would obtain an abortion next
time they become pregnant, if it were legally available, as against 14% of women
who had not had an accidental pregnancy.
Thus, past success or failure in family
planning seems to influence attitudes toward abortion.

A related question of import is the relationship between contraceptive practice and

attitudes toward abortion. Westoff et al.
(1969) found that women who were in
favor of family limitation were more liberal
toward abortion. In our data an analysis
was made to investigate the relation between current contraceptive practice and
attitudes toward abortion. The results are
shown in Table 4. The most liberal women
were those whose fertility was controlled
by mechanical methods of condom and
diaphragm. The mean abortion index for

attitudes toward abortion is not surprising.
Women who are on more effective methods
are evidently more concerned about control
of family size; they are also less religious,
are more likely to have higher education
and income, and are generally more liberal
in their outlook, as shown in Table 5.
SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND
ATTITUDES TOWARDS ABORTION

The above-considered variables of family
size and family planning are at best intervening variables which are a result of a
woman’s socioeconomic background, religious beliefs, and values and norms developed in her particular social milieu. The
relationship between many of these variables to her attitudes toward abortion are
investigated here. Our data show the most
important factor is religious affiliation
(Table 5). The mean abortion index for
Catholics was 3.36 compared to 5.97 for
Protestants and 6.89 for Jews. The next
most important factor was religiosity as
measured by church attendance. Women
who never attended church had a mean
abortion index of 6.02 compared to 3.57
for those who attended church five or more
times a month. Education and income were
both directly related to liberal attitudes
toward abortion. Since education and income are highly correlated, this consistency
is to be expected. Wife’s rural-urban background as measured by the size of her
birthplace was also directly related to attitudes toward abortion. The larger the
population of the birthplace, the more liberal were the attitudes.

MULTIPLE CLASSIFICATION ANALYSIS OF

ATTITUDES TOWARDS ABORTION

As many fertility and socioeconomic
variables are interrelated, it is difficult to
assess their relative importance without
appropriate multivariate analysis. Two statistical measures for each category of each
independent variable are shown in Table 6.
“Unadjusted” deviations are the deviations

Social Biology

of category “Mean Abortion Index” from
“Mean Abortion Index for All Women.”
“Adjusted” deviations are these categoryspecific deviations after the effects of other
independent variables are taken into account.

Religion seems to be the most powerful
indicator. Adjusting for religiosity and adjusting for all the other eight predictors does
not alter the pattern. Religiosity as measured by church attendance Is also found
to be equally important after controlling
for the other independent variables. The
greater the religiosity, the less liberal the
attitudes toward abortion. The direct relation between education and attitudes toward abortion persists even after controlling
for other predictors, but the strength of the
relation is much weaker. There is very little
difference between the educational categories, especially after 9 years of schooling.
The same is true for the rural-urban background of the wife. However, the relationship of husband’s income to attitudes
toward abortion still remains strong after
control for the other predictors.

For age and desired family size, the adjusted deviations are lower in magnitude
than unadjusted deviations, but the patterns are essentially the same. Why younger
women are less liberal than older women
is a somewhat perplexing question and requires further investigation.

When controlled for other predictors, the
relationship of current contraceptive use to
attitudes toward abortion loses much of its
significance. Only women using mechanical
methods of condom and diaphragm or
rhythm vary significantly from the overall
norm. Women who had an unwanted pregnancy in terms of number still seem to be
slightly more liberal than other women.

more important in shaping a woman’s attitudes toward abortion than situational
variables such as accidental pregnancy history, contraceptive practice, or desired or
expected number of children. Among the
socioeconomic variables, religion and religiosity are predominant. Our study seems
to indicate that more than any other factor
a decline in religious values and beliefs
would contribute to liberalized attitudes toward abortion.

The combined effects of the predictors on
the attitudes toward abortion are presented
in Table 7. The three situational variables
of desired family size, current contraceptive
practice, and last pregnancy status explain
only 10% of the variance in the abortion
index. When only the two predictors of
religion and religiosity are used, the vari
ance explained was 23%. When as many as
nine predictors are used, 31% of the variation is explained.2 The beta coefficients
indicate the relative importance of the different predictors. The fact that in spite of
using as many as nine independent variables, we are able to explain only about
one-third of the variance in the abortion
index suggests the complex nature of attitude formation on such a sensitive issue as
abortion.
