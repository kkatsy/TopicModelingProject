Sdo Paulo, S.P., Brazil

The present paper is part of a wider sample survey on human fertility in the District of Sado Paulo, Brazil (see Berqué et al.,
1968). For this research, the target population was defined as all nonsingle women who
in 1965 were between 15 and 49 years old
and living in the District of Sao Paulo. A
two-stage, stratified cluster sampling of
3,009 women (0.3% of the estimated target
population) was selected and interviewed.
All the tables presented concern the 2,857
women who had only one conjugal union.

The data presented are relevant to the
marriage patterns of the couples based on
two criteria: (1) educational attainment and
(2) place of birth and socialization. We will
also proceed to analyze the relations between these marriage patterns and the fertility of the couples.

The District of Sido Paulo has an area of
325.06 square miles. In 1965 its population
was estimated at 4,545,862 inhabitants, its
crude birth rate was 29.2 per thousand, and
its crude death rate, 8.3 per thousand (Berqué et al. 1968, p. 185). Greater SAo Paulo
is a highly industrialized region (responsible

260

 

for about 50% of the Brazilian industrial
production) and, naturally, a very important center of attraction for internal immigration both from rural areas and other
urban centers in Brazil.

MARRIAGE PATTERNS BY PLACE OF BIRTH
AND SOCIALIZATION OF THE COUPLES

Both wives and husbands have been classified in three identifying categories according to their origin: Rural, Rural-urban, and
Urban. These categories have been established through a criterion based on the site
of residence of the partners until about 14
years old. The category Rural-urban refers
to persons who have lived some length of
time (until about 14 years old) in both urban
and rural areas,

The similar distribution of men and
women appearing in Table 1 indicates that
migration to Sao Paulo has been only moderately selective in relation to the sex differential.

It should be mentioned that the gradient
Rural, Rural-urban, and Urban considered

in the sample has in most cases been significantly and consistently related to indicators of social and economic status. In this
gradient, the more privileged group is the
Urban one, and the less privileged, the Rural
one. For this reason we refer to it as “‘socialization,” rather than “residence.”

Considering the place of birth and socialization of the partners, we can distinguish
between homogamous and heterogamous
couples. Of the couples, 74.3% are homogamous, with the following distribution: both
partners Rural, 14.5%; both Rural-urban,
4.8%; both Urban, 55.0%. The heterogamous couples are represented by 25.7% of
the sample.

From the perspective of the place of birth
and socialization of the woman, we find the
following distribution.

1. Wives from Rural birth and socialization:

66.1% married to Rural husbands,
26.0% married to Urban husbands,
7.8% married to Rural-urban husbands.
2. Wives from Rural-urban birth and socialization:
46.6% married to Urban husbands,
38.5% married to Rural-urban husbands,
14.5% married to Rural husbands.

3. Wives of Urban birth and socialization:

83.6% married to Urban husbands,
9.7% married to Rural husbands,

6.6% married to Rural-urban husbands.

Sao Paulo Marriage Patterns

261

Observing the couples from the perspec
tives of the husbands, we have:

1. Husbands from Rural birth and socialization:
63.6% married to Rural wives,
28.3% married to Urban wives,
8.8% married to Rural-urban wives.
2. Husbands from Rural-urban birth and socialization:
43.8% married to Rural-urban wives,
40.4% married to Urban wives,
15.7% married to Rural wives.
3. Husbands from Urban birth and socialization:
82.7% married to Urban wives,
8.5% married to Rural wives,
8.6% married to Rural-urban wives.

These patterns of marriage are quite similar for the wives in comparison with their
husbands. They do not show any special opportunity or capacity of either men or women to establish a preferential pattern of
assortative marriage based on place of birth
and socialization. Comparing the random
combination of the partners with the observed pattern of marriage, as in Table 2,
we can perceive a very clear tendency for
assortative marriage.

The frequency relationship shown in
Table 2 indicates that for the homogamous

Urban, Rural, and Rural-urban marriages
there is an increasing tendency for more intense homogamy. However, it should be considered that some of the women were married before they arrived in Sao Paulo.

In order to perceive any possible change
in time of this assortative marriage pattern,
we divide our sample into two extreme cohorts. The first includes women between 15
and 25 years of age, and the second includes
women between 40 and 50 years of age.
These two cohorts have a mean different
time of marriage of about 20 years (see Tables 3 and 4).

The analysis of these tables and the dissimilarity index applied to the cohorts (Ta~
ble 5) showed that the assortative pattern
of marriage by place of birth and socialization has been continually maintained. The
tendency apparent in time has been rather
contradictory according to the different
places of birth and socialization of the women.

An increase of the selective character of
marriages is clear for the women of Rural
origin, less evident for the women of Urban
origin. For the women of Urban-rural origin

there is apparently a tendency to decrease
the selective character of marriage.

Table 6 expresses a consistent trend of
the fertility behavior of the couples in connection with the origin of the partners.
There is a clear positive relationship between the gradient Rural, Rural-urban, and
Urban and fertility, although the mean age
of marriage is not conspicuously different.

It should be observed that the place of
birth and socialization of the husbands apparently has some influence on the age of
marriage of the wives, Urban men marrying
older women in comparison with men born
and raised in Rural-urban and Rural areas.

The differential fertility verified in the
sample indicates a tendency for a demographic transition in the population. The
greater part of the sample actually adopts a
rather modern model of family (the mean
number of children per woman in the total
sample is 2.7) and a smaller part follows a
traditional and more fertile pattern of family.

The place of birth and socialization of the
partners are variables that differentiated
fertility in the sample in the most radical

way. We can assume that the set cf norms
and values predominant in rural areas of
Brazil is quite different from those of the
urban regions like Sao Paulo. This divergent
set of norms and values influences the ideal
size of the family and the reproductive behavior of the population. It is evident that
the place of birth and socialization of the
women have a correlation with their fertility, but it is interesting to consider that the
place of rearing of the husbands is also relevant in the transformation of the patterns
of family size.

EDUCATIONAL LEVEL OF THE COUPLES

The educational levels considered in this
work correspond to the formal system of
education in Brazil. They can be compared
approximately to the North American system as is indicated in the stub of Tables 7
through 14.

Tables 7 and 8 show the educational! level
of the partners. The men’s educational level
is slightly superior to that of the women. Of
the men, 62.6% do not continue their education further than the elementary level; for
the women, this percentage is 72.8%. For
the medium educational level, these percentages are 27.2% for the men and 25.1% for
the women; for superior education, they
are 10.2% for the men and 2.1% for the
women,

Table 9 indicates that the women tend to

marry men with a superior or at least a similar level of education.

Table 10 indicates the frequency relationship between observed and expected
patterns of marriage, showing an assortative
pattern of marriage based on the educational achievement of the partners. It indicates a selective pattern of marriage in
which certain educational levels of the partners tended to increase the probability of
marriage and, conversely, certain educational levels of the partners tended to decrease, to an ever greater extent, the probability of marriage.

Tables 11 and 12 present two cohorts of
women, the first including women between
15 and 25 years of age and the second including the women between 40 and 50 years
of age. The comparison between these tables
shows a general tendency for the younger
generation to increase the selective character of the marriage pattern based on educational achievement.

The dissimilarity index applied in Table
13 shows that the younger cohort tends to
exclude in a more selective way than the
older one, certain patterns of marriage based
on educational achievement.

Fertility rates are clearly influenced by
the educational levels of the partners, as
presented in Table 14.
