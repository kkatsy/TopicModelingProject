ABSTRACT: This paper tests, within the framework of LISREL, the causal structures of fertility
using data from the 1973-74 Growth of Alberta Family Study (GAFS) of women aged 18-44
who are currently married or living common-law. Differential fertility among two groups of
women classified by nativity also are examined. The women’s background characteristics (e.g.,
age, religiosity, and education) are viewed as exogenous variables. The endogenous variables
are familism and expected family size; familism is designated as an intermediate variable in the
model, linking demographic and socioeconomic (including cultural) factors to fertility. The
results indicate that familism acts as an important variable explaining fertility, particularly,
among foreign-born women. The study confirms and extends earlier research findings that
religiosity and education influence couples’ fertility, the former positively and the latter

negatively.

In the past three decades an extensive
body of literature has developed from
attempts to develop theoretical models
for the analysis of fertility (Becker,
1960, 1981; Hill, 1966; Blake, 1968;
Heer, 1968; Easterlin, 1969; Namboodiri, 1972a, 6; Freedman, 1975; Bongaarts, 1978). It has been argued that
married couples, as participants in sociocultural systems, incorporate values
of childbearing into their family orientations and that these orientations play a
strong role in determining their family
size. Based on this thesis, fertility has
been studied as being dependent on
such structural variables as social class
(Kunz, 1965), religious affiliation
(Freedman et al., 1961), and race and
residential background (Westoff et al.,
1961). Although these traditional variables predicted fertility reasonably well
at one time, some researchers argue that
the variables have lost most of their explanatory power (Westoff and Westoff,
1971; Turchi, 1975).

Recognizing a blurring of fertility differentials across broad social categories,
several researchers have directed their
attention instead to other factors that
might explain variations within social
categories. This group of social scientists view fertility as primarily dependent on such factors as attitudes and
husband-wife communication (e.g.,
Hill, 1966). Accordingly, parental perception of having children has been
viewed as a motivational factor influencing family-size goals and actual fertility
performance.

Several researchers have argued that
while the structural approach is insufficient to understand the wide variations
that exist between attitude and action
within broad social categories, the micro
approach also is inadequate because it
does not take into account the role of
structural factors in the formation of attitude and action. An alternative approach to the study of fertility therefore
has emerged, one which attempts to in

corporate structural variables into the
micro approach (see Mitchell and
Pratto, 1977).

The purpose of this paper is to explain fertility from this perspective. The
study tests a causal model which describes the influence of structural factors
(e.g., religiosity and education) on such
micro variables as familism, and the relative total effects of all those factors on
rertility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Scanzoni (1975) argued that women
who define themselves through traditional female roles marry earlier, are
less likely to be employed full-time or to
use effective contraception, and are expected to bear more children than
women with less familial orientation.
He claimed that “the greater the individualism, the less the familism” (p.
187). Bell’s (1968) argument is that parents who hold high pro-family values expend material and emotional resources
on their children, while those holding
anti-family values expend such resources to support their life-styles. This
suggests that familistic couples are more
likely to avoid life-styles predominated
by careerism and consumerism and are
more likely to have large families. _

The research reported here looked at
whether familism has an impact on expected family size, using a model of fertility and familism developed and estimated using maximum likelihood
(LISREL) techniques. Specifically, it
tested the hypothesis that fertility expectations may be interpreted in terms
of the inter-related operation of demographic and socioeconomic factors (including cultural), and familistic orientation.

In examining familism’s effects on

Social Biology

fertility!, the possibility of interactions
by nativity was also considered. Familyrelated norms differ by nativity. Because nativity is not a unidimensional
concept, but multidimensional, including values, norms, attitudes, and practices, the causal linkages between familism and fertility will be different for
Canadian-born and foreign-born
women.

HYPOTHESES

In this study, control variables are:
age of wife (AGE), education of wife
(EDU), religiosity of wife (REL), and
house space (HSE). These are designated as exogenous variables in the
model. These variables (with the exception of house space) constitute the key
elements for the socioeconomic analysis
for fertility. The economic framework
for fertility analysis, for example, assumes that couples’ background characteristics influence the demand for children (Becker, 1960; Namboodiri,
1972a, b). Namboodiri (1972a, b) noted
that factors such as socioeconomic status and residential background are the
important sociosituational factors relevant to fertility behavior of couples.

Wife’s age (AGE) has been one of
the most frequently used variables in
studying the determinants of fertility
(Namboodiri, 1974; Grindstaff, 1975).
Namboodiri (1974) noted that wife’s age
(and her age at marriage) affects familysize intentions at all parities. Wife’s age
also appears to be related to familism.

1Some caution regarding a familism-fertility relationship is needed. Familism is influenced to
some degree by the number of children a couple
already has. This is especially the case when expected family size is equal to current family size.
We cannot be sure of the direction of the potential
bias whether we over- or underestimate familism
- fertility effects by the exclusion of the path from

fertility to familism. Thus, readers should be aware
of this limitation.

Waite et al. (1986) observed that more
and more young adults are developing
tastes and skills that adversely affect
their orientation to family roles. Thus,
one could expect wife’s age to be positively affecting familism and fertility.

There is a good deal of empirical evidence that education predicts fertility of
couples negatively (Nam, 1968; Rich,
1973; Cochrane, 1983). According to
Nam (1968), higher education leads to a
delay in marriage and provides knowledge about alternatives to childbearing.
Rich (1973) argued that an increase in
the level of education means a change in
family-related values and norms and
thus a reduction in fertility. Those who
are educated are more likely to adopt innovations quickly and are more exposed
to birth control techniques. These orientations suggest that: education of wife
negatively affects familism and fertility.

Previous studies are inconclusive in
suggesting that religious affiliation is an
important determinant of couples’ fertility (Burch, 1966; Westoff and Ryder,
1977). Burch (1966) stated that there is a
convergence in Catholic—non-Catholic
fertility differentials in Canada, while in
the United States there is a widening.
Jones and Westoff’s study (1979) in the
United States, however, indicated that
Catholic—-non-Catholic differentials in
fertility were small and narrowing. They
concluded that the traditional ‘Catholic
fertility” is ending. Against this background, the present study used religiosity (measured as attendance at religious
services) rather than religious affiliation. It can be argued that frequent attenders of church services are more
likely to be intrinsically religious and
hold pro-family values. Thus, religiosity
ts expected to be positively affecting familism and fertility.

The effects of housing conditions on

Fertility and Familism

61

human behavior and attitudes have
been investigated by several researchers, although relatively little research is
concerned with the effects of house
space on fertility. It has been generally
observed that families raising children
prefer to avoid small apartment living.
There are indications too that some parents would have more children if they
had more space in which to raise them
(see Felson and Solaun, 1975). Some researchers argue that a large house with
separate bedrooms could facilitate privacy and thereby enhance fertility (e.g.,
Morris, 1977). Also, housing would
probably permit greater socialization
between parents (Merton, 1948; Morris,
1977). Those arguments suggest that:
house space (measured as number of
rooms in a house) positively affects fertility?

The preceding discussion has, because of the limited scope of this paper,
omitted some important variables.
These include wife’s wage, employment
status, and income. Although these varlables are available in the GAFS, they
are not included in the present analysis
in the interest of simplifying the model.
A brief description of the variables,
their means and standard deviations are
presented in Table 1.

2One could argue that fertility and house space
act in opposite directions. For example, it has long
been suspected that families, particularly those
with children, purchase homes to assure financial
security, social status, and above all, desirable living conditions (Merton, 1948). While the direction
of causation needs further study, house space
should be considered as positively related to family
size. Admittedly, the reciprocal relationship
would have been desirable. However, it was not
possible to consider the reciprocal relationship because this would cause the model to be “unidentified.” In other words, to avoid a statistical probIem, the path from fertility to house space was
dropped.

3An effort to use wife’s wage as a control variable was discarded because it showed high zeroorder correlation with wife’s education.

MEASURES OF THE DEPENDENT VARIABLES

In this study, familism was measured
attitudinally. An index was constructed
based on responses to questions asking
respondents about their attitudes toward working mothers, happiness associated with children, women who stay at
home as full-time mothers, and guilt associated with separation of mother and
children. The index included the items
listed below:

a. A pre-school child is likely to suffer if
the mother works;

b. It is much better for everyone involved if the man is the achiever outside the home and the women takes
care of their children;

c. Women are much happier if they stay
at home and take care of their children; and

d. If anything serious happened to one of
the children while the mother was
working, she could never forgive herself,

The items were coded from one to
five with one indicating strong disagree
ment and five indicating strong agreement. As a first step in the computation
of the index, a factor analysis of the
items was performed. The second step
was to compute the index by summing
the items which loaded highly on a factor.*

A major problem associated with the
measurement of fertility preferences or
current fertility is that they do not necessarily measure the future childbearing
ability of couples. Of course, there exists no way of knowing what completed
family size ultimately will be since most
of the women are still in their childbearing ages. Number of children ever-born
and current family size, however, are
strongly affected by age and marriage
duration or by a woman’s stage in the
life-cycle (Smith, 1981). In contrast, expected family size is a measure which ad
‘The factor loadings associated with the items
are 0.721, 0.797, 0.719, and 0.639. For a discussion
of the computation of scales using factor loadings
of Likert-type attitude items, see Smith-Lovin and
Tickamyer (1978).

justs for life-cycle differences. The measure of expected family size is the sum of
the number of children ever born to the
mother (and still living at the time of the
survey, regardless of whether or not
they reside with their mother), plus expected future births. When there is indication that the respondent or her husband cannot have more children,
expected family size is current family
size.
DATA

The data used in this study are obtained from a fertility survey of 1,045
women between the ages of 18 to 54, regardless of marital status, in Edmonton,
Alberta during the winter of 1973-74.
The survey, called the Growth of Alberta Families Study (GAFS), was the
third major fertility survey to be conducted in Canada, and the first in Western Canada. The questionnaire used
was a detailed base-line fertility schedule derived from the standard internationally used instrument (The Population Council, 1970) in order to ensure
comparability with previous surveys
conducted in the population field (see
Krishnan and Krotki, 1976, for a comprehensive report of the GAFS).

The sample drawn for the present
study was limited to women in the age
group 18-44 who at the time were married or living common-law. A total of
614 women met these criteria. Of these,
473 women were Canadian-born, and
141 women were foreign-born.

Models of familism and fertility
which integrate the four variables described earlier were analyzed by means
of the LISREL VI computer program
(Joreskog and Sorbom, 1986). The use
of structural equation models in demographic research is now commonplace
and requires no elaboration here.

Fertility and Familism

 

63

The model estimated in the present
study does not include multiple indicators for its factors. When one indicator
variable is used for a given factor, it is almost impossible to estimate meaningful
error variances (Ladewig and McGee,
1986). Therefore, error variance estimates were constrained to specific values (1-aSD*) as recommended by
Joreskog and Sorbom (1982), to provide
an approximation of the amount of error in that measure.

RESULTS

As shown in Table 1, Canadian-born
women clearly differ from foreign-born
women in the following respects:

(1) Canadian-born in this sample are,
on the average, younger than the
foreign-born by almost three years;
Canadian-born, on the average,
have lower levels of religious participation than foreign-bom, although
the differentials are not substantial;
and

the two groups have, on average, the
same expected family size (2.68 and
2.67 respectively for Canadian-born
and foreign-born).

(2)

(3)

The variance of age for foreign-born
is nearly two-thirds the variance of the
native-born comparison group (not
shown in the table). The variance in education for foreign-born is about double
that for Canadian-born. These findings
justify the need to consider different
causal structures for the two groups.

presentation of the model results.°

The model in Figure 1 (Canadianborn model) provides a statistically perfect fit to the data: y* = 0.01; d.f. = 1;
P = 0.998; AFGI = 0.998 (A small
value of chi-square corresponding to a p
value close to 1.0 indicates that the
model fits the data well). Another way
of describing the fit is to note that the exogenous variables explain 21.4 per cent
of the variation in FAM and 9.7 per cent
of the variation in EFS. This means that
the model, although capturing some important aspects of the process of fertility
behavior, still overlooks numerous factors which may explain the process.

The Lambdas associated with the endogenous
variables for the Canadian-born Model are 2.535
and 1.358 and for the Foreign-born Model are
2.617 and 1.451 respectively for FAM and EFS.
The Lambdas associated with the exogenous variables for the Canadian-born Model are 8.358,
2.057, 0.703, and 1.620 and for the Foreign-bom
Model are 7.906, 2.965, 0.800, and 1.557 respectively for AGE, EDU, REL, and HSE. The Theta
Epsilons associated with the endogenous variables
for the Canadian-born Model are 1.606 and 0.205
respectively for FAM and EFS. The corresponding figures for the Foreign-born Model are 1.712
and 0.234. The Theta Delta associated with the exogenous variables for the Canadian-born Model
are 12.328, 0.747, 0.087, and 0.291 respectively for
AGE, EDU, REL, and HSE. The corresponding

figures for the Foreign-born Model are 11.031,
1.551, 0.113, and 0.269.

Fertility and Familism 65

The findings indicate that the two
most important predictors of familism in
Canadian-born women are education
and religiosity (coefficients are —0.428
and 0.149, respectively). These findings
suggest a tendency among highly educated women to be less familistic and
highly religious women to be more familistic. With respect to the relationship
between the endogenous variables of
familism and expected family size, familism has a positive effect on expected
family size (0.085). As Table 2 indicates,
education is the most significant predictor of expected family size (—0.217); the
higher the education, the fewer the
number of children expected. House
space has a positive effect on expected
family size. The omission of nonrecursive relationships between house space
and expected family size may have overor under-estimated the coefficient for
the variable; however, the finding supports earlier findings by Krishnan (1988)
in Canada.

The model in Figure 2 (foreign-born
model) also provides a statistically perfect fit to the data: x? = 0.05; d.f. = 1;
P = 0.831; AGFI = 0.998. The exogenous variables explain 21.6 per cent of
the variation in familism and 22.9 per
cent of the variation in expected family
size. The findings presented in Figure 2
and Table 2 (the lower portion) indicate
that education is the only significant predictor of familism (—0.362). On the
other hand, all the variables with the exception of wife’s age have significant effects on expected family size, with education being the strongest (—0.289).
The hypothesis that familism affects expected family size is well supported
(0.144).

for both the Canadian-born and foreignborn groups. The total effect of religiosity on expected family size is significantly greater than the direct effect,
indicating a strong indirect effect of the
variable on expected family size, via
familism. In general, the results suggests
that highly traditional and religious
women are more likely to have large
families.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

This paper has focused on two distinct but related issues: (1) the extent to
which demographic-background variables, including religiosity, independently affect fertility and (2) the extent
to which these variables influence fertility through the intervening variable of
familism. In general, the results indicate
that regardless of the nativity of women,
women who define themselves through
traditional female roles are likely to
bear more children than women who do
not. The effect of familism on fertility is
relatively stronger among immigrant
women. Among structural factors, reli

giosity is the most important and education is the second most important factor
directly influencing expected family
size, regardless of nativity. Further, religiosity is the most powerful variable affecting familism in the case of Canadianborn women, whereas education is the
most powerful variable influencing familism in the case of foreign-born women.

The model of fertility analyzed in this
paper is a potentially useful framework
for understanding the fertility behavior
of couples in modern societies. The
model is particularly useful for describing specific indirect paths through which
social structural factors (e.g., religiosity
and education) affect fertility of immigrant women. Contrary to expectations
grounded in the theoretical literature,
the results indicate that the traditional
indicators of structural (sociocultural)
factors tend to be directly related to
couples’ fertility. The evidence strongly
suggests that sociocultural variables
have large influence on family-related
values.

The results appear to have some relevance for policy makers as well. ImpleDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

mentation of certain social and cultural
changes may have important effects on
reproductive motivation, and hence on
fertility. For example, the findings indicate that house space, an indicator of the
living conditions, may have a strong effect on fertility. If this is true, constraints
in the housing market constitute a serious impediment to poorer people wanting large families. Although the finding
that house space affects fertility positively is of importance, the results are
clearly preliminary because of the omission of nonrecursive relationship between house space and fertility.

The conclusions of this study are to
some extent tentative, as further research is necessary. It would be desirable to extend this research to include

 

Fertility and Familism 67

other structural factors (e.g., place of
residence) and multiple indicators for
familism by using a more recent data set.
Nevertheless, the present research establishes the fact that a woman’s relative
preference for the familial role may be
reflected in her actual fertility behavior
(particularly, in the case of foreignborns) and that further research along
these lines would be fruitful. In general,
the present analysis can be considered a
first step in investigating the effects of
familism on fertility patterns of Canadian couples within a causal framework.
