ABSTRACT: Data collected in contraceptive prevalence surveys for Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand,
Barbados, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Peru on how soon following childbirth menstruation returned provide the basis for national-level estimates of the duration of postpartum amenorrhea.
Two somewhat different techniques are used for estimating median and mean durations of postpartum amenorrhea. The results are compared with information indicating patterns of breastfeeding. The analysis indicates considerable cross-national variation in the mean and median
duration of postpartum amenorrhea and suggests that estimating postpartum amenorrhea

from information on breastfeeding alone could be misleading.

One of the most significant advances
in fertility analysis during the last several
decades has been the identification of intermediate (or proximate) fertility determinants and the development of
techniques to assess quantitatively their
contribution to fertility levels, differentials, and changes. In their pioneering
article on the topic, Davis and Blake
(1956) specified eleven variables
through which, and only through which,
all other fertility determinants must operate, be they socioeconomic, cultural,
physiological, or environmental. More
recently, Bongaarts (1978) revised the
original classification and provided a
simple analytical accounting framework
which permits a quantitative assessment
of the contribution of different proximate determinants to given fertility levels or changes.!

‘Several other frameworks for relating the
proximate determinants to fertility have also been
developed. See Gaslonde and Bocaz, 1970; Mosley et al. 1982; and Hobcraft and Little, 1984. To
date, however, the Bongaarts framework has received the most attention and application.

308

Empirically, Bongaarts (1980) found
that four proximate determinants—
marriage pattern, contraceptive use and
effectiveness, prevalence of induced
abortion, and the duration of the postpartum nonsusceptible period (the perlod prior to the resumption of ovulation
following a birth)—account for most
variation in fertility levels among populations. The postpartum nonsusceptible
period varies considerably, not only
among individuals, but between different populations or population subgroups. It is more or less coincident with
the period of postpartum amenorrhea
and is believed to be primarily determined by the duration and intensity of
breastfeeding (Tyson and Perez, 1978).

One hindrance to the application of
Bongaarts’ accounting scheme has been
the lack of information based on representative samples of the duration of the
nonsusceptible period for many populations. As a result, applications of the
Bongaarts scheme have generally relied
on estimating the duration of the nonsusceptible period from information on
Vol. 31, No. 3-4

the duration of breastfeeding. Given the
variability in the relationship between
these two, information specifically on
the duration of the postpartum nonsusceptible period would be extremely useful and would improve the accuracy with
which the contribution of proximate determinants can be assessed. Moreover,
the length of the postpartum nonsusceptible period determines how soon after a
birth a woman is at risk of conception,
cand hence in need of contraception if
‘she wishes to delay or prevent the next
"epregnancy (McCann et al., 1981). Consequently, reliable information on the
duration of the postpartum nonsusceptiple period is of considerable importance
Sto family planning programs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In a number of Contraceptive Prevaence Surveys administered by WesStinghouse Health Systems during the
ast few years in developing countries,
nformation was collected which makes
Si possible to indirectly estimate the duEration of postpartum amenorrhea and
“shence the period of postpartum nonsusceptibility. While the periods of post-Cpartum amenorrhea and nonsusceptibilcity are not strictly identical, they tend to
Sbe quite similar. Since ovulation generGally precedes menstruation by two

weeks, the period of nonsusceptibility

would end two weeks prior to the resumption of menstruation or to when
menstruation would have resumed (in
cases where the woman conceives prior
to first menstruation for those women
whose first menstrual cycle following
childbirth is ovulatory). For some
women, however, the first one or two
menstrual cycles are anovulatory and
the period of nonsusceptibility exceeds
the period of amenorrhea (McCann et

rsity_of Michigan] at 13:

Postpartum Amenorrhea

309

al., 1981). To some extent, these two
groups of women balance each other
out, and thus the average durations of
postpartum amenorrhea and nonsusceptibility would be quite similar to the
aggregate level.

In the present study, we utilized two
related techniques to estimate the duration of postpartum amenorrhea. One,
referred to as the “monthly current status technique,” is used to approximate
the cumulative probabilities of postpartum amenorrhea terminating at successive monthly intervals following a birth,
as well as to estimate the median duration of postpartum amenorrhea. The
other, referred to as the “prevalence
technique,” is used only to estimate the
mean duration of postpartum amenorrhea.

Each of the two techniques requires
us to determine, for each woman who
has had at least one live birth, whether
or not, at the time of interview, she had
experienced a termination of postpartum amenorrhea as indicated by either a
return of menstruation or a new pregnancy since her last live birth. In the case
of the monthly current status approach,
a cross-tabulation of a woman’s current
status with respect to termination of
amenorrhea and the number of months
since her last live birth are treated as if
they represent the experience of a cohort of women over time during successive months following a birth. The median duration of postpartum amenorrhea is estimated as the point at which
the experience of this synthetic cohort
indicates 50 per cent of the women had
terminated postpartum amenorrhea.

The prevalence technique provides
an even simpler way for estimating the
mean duration of postpartum amenorthea. The mean is computed simply by
dividing the number of women currently

amenorrheic (in the present case, limited to those who had their last live birth
within three years of the interview) by
the average number of births per month
(estimated in the present study by the
average number of monthly births in the
12 months prior to interview). Implicit
in this technique is the assumption of
stability in postpartum amenorrhea duration and the annual flow of births over
the recent past.

Both methods have been described
elsewhere, although usually in connection with the estimation of the duration
of breastfeeding for which the logic is
quite similar (Page, 1982; Ferry and
Smith, 1983). World Fertility Survey
data show the prevalence technique to
be surprisingly robust, given its simplicity, through comparisons made between
different techniques (Ferry and Smith,
1983). An example of its use for estimating both breastfeeding and postpartum
amenorrhea durations is available in a
regional study of Brazil (Anderson et
al., 1983).

Information from Contraceptive
Prevalence Surveys on the number of
months since last live birth is available
either from a direct question or by comparing the reported month and year of
the birth with the date of the interview.
The woman’s current status in terms of
postpartum amenorrhea is determined
in one of two ways. In one survey, responses to a question on current pregnancy status are combined with responses as to how long after the last live
birth menstruation resumed. In other
surveys, responses to a question on current pregnancy status are combined with
responses as to how long ago the last
menstrual period was experienced. It
should be noted that some women who
reported themselves as currently pregnant may have conceived prior to a re

turn of menstruation. For convenience,
however, we will refer to this combined
proportion of women who either menstruated or became pregnant as the proportion who experienced termination of
postpartum amenorrhea. This is done
since, for pregnant women, ovulation
must have resumed and the nonsusceptible period must have terminated.

Monthly current status data typically
display irregularities due to the limited
number of respondents who had a birth
each particular number of months prior
to interview. For application of the
monthly current status approach, these
irregularities were smoothed by calculating three-month weighted moving averages of the proportions of women classified as having experienced the
termination of postpartum amenorrhea.
No smoothing was necessary for applications of the prevalence approach.

In practice, determination of
whether or not a woman experienced
termination of postpartum amenorrhea
(in the sense used here) is complicated
somewhat by the choice of coded response categories for the question on
when menstruation was last experienced
and, in some cases, by ambiguities in the
response pattern. For all surveys, data
on how long ago the respondent had her
last menstrual period were recorded in
pre-coded categories. These categories,
however, were not uniform across surveys. Only in the two Colombian surveys was a category specifically designated for “not since pregnancy.” In
each of the surveys, the coded categories distinguished between women
whose last menstruation occurred
within one month, between one and two
months, and more than two months
prior to interview. In several, a separate
category was also included for women
whose most recent menstrual period ocVol. 31, No. 3-4

curred more than nine months prior to
interview. Data from the one survey in
which women were asked how long it
took for menstruation to return after the
most recent birth were also pre-coded,
including an explicit category for
women who had not yet experienced a
return of menstruation. Since, in all surveys, pregnancy status at the time of interview was asked, currently pregnant

4 the nine months of pregnancy in the reported months since last menstruation,
they probably reported the number of
months without menstruation since giving birth. This interpretation is supported by the finding that the number of
women who reported their last menstruation as three to nine months ago drops
off sharply for those whose last birth was
more than nine months ago. In addition,
some women in this category have mistakenly interpreted nonmenstrual
bleeding shortly after giving birth as a

menstrual period even though no menstruation was subsequently experienced. Thus, for the initial year after
giving birth, women who reported their
fast menstrual period within 60 days of
interview or reported themselves as
pregnant are considered to have experienced termination of postpartum amenorrhea. The exceptions are two Colombian surveys in which a special category
of “not since pregnancy” was included
and the 1981 Costa Rican survey in
which a question was asked on how long
after the last live birth menstruation resumed. Women in all other categories,
unless pregnant, were considered to still
be in the postpartum amenorrheic stage
with a few exceptions due to unusual
features of the codes chosen in particular countries.

RESULTS

Results based on the monthly current
status technique for ali countries to date
for which the requisite data were collected are presented in Table 1 for
monthly intervals through the first year
following the most recent birth.> Al
?Additional details of the rules followed in the
determination of a woman’s current status with respect to termination of postpartum amenorrhea
specific to the particular surveys are provided in an
earlier version of this study issued as Research Report No. 83-42, Population Studies Center, University of Michigan, November, 1983.

3In all but the 1981 Thailand survey, the number of months since last birth was either asked directly or was calculated by subtracting the reported
month and year of last birth from the month and
year of interview. In the former case, respondents
are assumed to have given responses to the nearest
completed number of months rather than strictly
the fast completed month and thus to be centered
on the first day rather than the middle of each
month. Similarly, subtraction of the month and
year of last birth from the month and year of interview yields single month categories centered on
the first day of the month corresponding to the difference between the two dates (Page et al., 1982).

though the technique does not ensure
that the proportions terminating postpartum amenorrhea will decline at each
successive month since the most recent
birth (as would be the case if a true cohort were being followed, or if standard
life table methodology were applied),
this turns out to be the case, with only
occasional exceptions. Moreover, for all
surveys, a median duration of postpartum amenorrhea (defined as the point at
which 50 percent indicated either a return of menses or a pregnancy) can be
unambiguously identified.

The total number of women included
in the calculations are also presented.
Since the results represent three-month
moving averages, the number of women
serving as the basis of of the proportion
terminating at any specific monthly interval is, of course, substantially less
than the total number of women (averaging 3/13 of the total).4 The number of
women serving as the basis of the calculation of the median is also given.
For all but the 1978 survey in Costa
Rica, interpolation between the threemonth moving averages for two successive monthly intervals was necessary;
thus, the number of women involved in
the calculation of the median came from
those who reported their most recent

Results from the 1981 Thailand survey, where
months since last birth had to be calculated by
subtracting the month and year of last birth from
the date of the midpoint of the survey fieldwork,
have been adjusted for presentation in the present
study so that they are directly comparable to
results from the other surveys. For this reason, the
results presented in Table 1 for the 1981 Thailand
survey differ from those published previously (see
Knodel et al., 1982).

‘Since three-month weighted moving averages
are used as the basis for each monthly figure, to obtain figures through the twelfth month, data for the
first thirteen months must be used. The total number of women thus cover a thirteen-month period,
and the average number used for any single-month
calculation is 3/13ths of the total.

birth as occurring during some specific
four-month period prior to the survey.
For 1978 in Costa Rica, the median fell
exactly on the midpoint of a monthly interval and thus involves women whose
last birth occurred over a three-month
period. It is evident that the medians are
not based on large numbers of women.
The fact that the overall results for each
country closely approximate a monotonic increase in the proportions estimated as terminating postpartum amenorrhea, and that a unique median is
evident in all cases, provides grounds for
some confidence in the results. However, the median for Barbados and for
the 1978 Costa Rican survey, both of
which are based on substantially fewer
women than is the case for the other surveys, should be treated with particular
caution.

What is most striking about the
results is how quickly postpartum amenorrhea appears to terminate in most of
the countries. Only for Korean women
is the median duration substantially
above half a year. The estimated median durations of only one month for
Costa Rica in 1978 and 1.6 months for
Barbados both seem extraordinarily low
and may well be less reliable due to the
small number of cases on which they are
based. It is noteworthy that the 1981 survey in Costa Rica, which is based on a
much larger number of cases as well as a
somewhat different question for determining the woman’s current status,
yields a longer and more plausible estimate of postpartum amenorrhea. While
the estimate of 1.6 months in Barbados
seems quite low, it is somewhat reassuring that results for subsequent month intervals also are consistent with a low duration of postpartum amenorrhea. In
brief, the results suggest that at least for
most of the limited number of develop

ing countries for which Westinghouse
Contraceptive Prevalence Survey data
are available, postpartum nonsusceptibility is providing protection against a
new pregnancy for only a relatively brief
period following a birth for the majority
of women.

Although the median is calculated as
the duration at which 50 per cent of the
synthetic cohort of women who recently
gave birth either experience a return of
menstruation or a pregnancy, it should
be recognized that, for a small proportion of any real cohort of women giving
birth at any particular time, postpartum
amenorrhea will merge into menopause; for these women, there will be
neither a return of menstruation nor a
subsequent pregnancy. The proportion
will depend on the duration of proportions amenorrheic, and the average age
at birth is positively related to each. Under virtually any realistic circumstances,
however, the proportion should be
small since the average age at menopause is typically far higher than average
age at last birth, even in natural fertility
populations (Gray, 1979). The fact that
postpartum amenorrhea rarely merges
into menopause is confirmed in Table 2
which shows the proportion of women
who reported neither a pregnancy nor a
return of menstruation among those
whose most recent birth occurred 19-24
months and 32-36 months prior to interview. As the results indicate (with the
exception only of Honduras), this involved less than 10 percent of women in
the latter category. Some of these
women will probably still experience a
return of menstruation and thus the percentage shown is an estimate of the maximum extent to which this complication
occurs.

Estimates of the mean duration of
postpartum amenorrhea obtained by

the prevalence technique are presented
in Table 3 at the national level as well as
separately for the urban and rural segments of the population. Given that medians derived from the monthly current
Status techniques are based on a far
smaller number of cases than are means
from the prevalence technique, only the
latter are employed for obtaining separate urban and rural estimates. As with
the calculation of the median, the means
based on the prevalence technique also
ignore the problem created by the fact
that, in reality, the period of postpartum
amenorrhea for some women would
merge into menopause. This should not
seriously distort our estimates, however, given the small proportion of
women involved. Moreover, the fact
that the prevalence technique is applied
only to women who had a birth in the
last three years further minimizes any
problem created by menopausal women
reporting themselves as still amenortheic. Indeed, since a small number of
women also might experience postpartum amenorrhea for more than three
years, the exclusion of women whose
birth occurred more than three years
ago will act to cancel out the effect of
amenorrhea merging into menopause
for other women.

The rank ordering of the mean duration of postpartum amenorrhea (from
the prevalence technique) on the national level is almost identical to that
based on the median calculated from the
monthly current status technique. For
both the mean and the median, Korea is
characterized by the longest average duration, and Costa Rica, in 1978, by the
shortest. In every case except for Korea,
the estimated mean is longer than the estimated median. A longer mean than
median is generally to be expected for
populations in which the median dura

Lesthaeghe, 1982; Figure 2). While
there is undoubtedly a margin of error

rural differences in postpartum amenorrhea to be evident. It is thus encouraging
that the results indicate shorter average
periods of postpartum amenorrhea
among urban women in comparison to
their rural counterparts for all of the surveys. The differences range from as
much as five months or more in Honduras and Peru to under two months for
Colombia and Costa Rica. Thus, there
is some variation in the differences between rural and urban populations with
respect to the amount of protection provided against pregnancy through postpartum amenorrhea.

It is of considerable interest to compare our estimates of the duration of

 

Social Biology

postpartum amenorrhea with information on breastfeeding patterns. Of the
surveys which serve as the basis for our
estimates of postpartum amenorrhea,
most did not include questions on infant
feeding practices; of those that did, only
results from the 1981 Thailand survey
have been analyzed in detail. Fortunately, however, for countries covered
in the present study (except for Barbados and Honduras), data on breastfeeding patterns are available from the
World Fertility Survey for years not far
removed from the time of the Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys. In addition,
unpublished tabulations on current status data regarding breastfeeding are
available for Barbados from the Contraceptive Prevalence Survey, and they can
be used to provide at least some relevant
information. Thus, only for Honduras is
no information available.

Analysis of breastfeeding patterns
from survey data is a complex matter involving a number of methodological
problems (Page et al., 1982). There is no
single measure that most accurately indicates the extent of breastfeeding in a
population; thus, whenever possible,
several indices based on different approaches are presented in Table 4. In all
the countries with available data except
Costa Rica, breastfeeding is close to universal, involving at least 90 per cent of
all children; in Costa Rica, only about
three-quarters of children are ever
breastfed. The average duration of
breastfeeding is noticeably longer in the
three Asian countries than in the Latin
American ones. This is evident from the
two alternative measures of the median
duration, as well as from the estimated
proportions of children still breastfeeding at six and twelve months of age. Particularly striking is the very low median
duration of breastfeeding in Costa Rica

(less than two months according to one
estimate). Less than one in three children in Costa Rica is breastfed for at
least six months, and less than one in ten
for at least a year. In contrast, over 90
per cent of Korean children are reported
as breastfed for at least six months.

The extremely short duration of
breastfeeding in Costa Rica, as well as
the relatively high proportion of mothers who never initiate breastfeeding, is
consistent with the short durations of
postpartum amenorrhea indicated in the
Costa Rican Contraceptive Prevalence
Surveys (although not necessarily as low
as the one-month estimate of the median for 1978). Likewise, the short duration of breastfeeding indicated in Barbados is more or less consistent with the
short duration of postpartum amenorrhea indicated there. At the other end of

the scale, Korea, Sri Lanka, and Thailand are all characterized by durations
of breastfeeding of close to a year anda
half or more. Despite these apparently
similar breastfeeding patterns, the Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys have indicated considerably longer postpartum
amenorrhea in Korea than in either Sri
Lanka or Thailand. In the middle of the
scale, Colombia is characterized both by
a shorter median duration of postpartum amenorrhea and shorter breastfeeding than is Peru.

The lack of close correspondence between the estimates of postpartum
amenorrhea and breastfeeding patterns
evident in the comparison of Korea with
Sri Lanka and Thailand may, of course,
be due to errors in measurement of e1ther or both phenomena. On the other
hand, it may also reflect a lack of com

plete information on breastfeeding as
well as the influence of other relevant
but unmeasured variables. While precise knowledge of the determinants of
the relationship between breastfeeding
and postpartum amenorrhea is still lacking, there is considerable evidence that
one important influence is the type of
feeding regime followed. In particular,
the impact of breastfeeding on prolonging postpartum amenorrhea js greater
for mothers who exclusively breastfeed
than for those who follow a mixed feeding pattern (Van Ginneken, 1974). Unfortunately, data permitting the distinction between full and_ partial
breastfeeding were collected in only a
small number of the countries participating in the World Fertility Survey, not
including any of those under consideration. It seems likely that responses to a
general question not specifically distinguishing partial from full breastfeeding
refer to any form of breastfeeding
(Page, et al., 1982).

In the 1981 Thailand Contraceptive
Prevalence Survey, however, information was collected on the age at which
nonmilk food was introduced into the
child’s diet and thus permits the calculation of the duration of “‘full” breastfeeding.> Analysis of these data indicated
that supplemental food was commonly
introduced at a very early age and thus
the median duration of full breastfeeding was only 2.1 months, in sharp contrast to the much longer duration of
breastfeeding. This could account for
the relatively short period of postpar

foods and not to milk products other than breast
milk, responses exaggerate somewhat the extent
of full breastfeeding since mothers may have supplemented breastfeeding with formula or nonformula milk products before introducing other
foods.

tum amenorrhea indicated for Thailand,
despite the short duration of any breastfeeding. Moreover, in comparison with
those few countries for which the World
Fertility Survey did collect information
specifically on partial and full breastfeeding, Thai women appear to introduce supplemental food unusually early
(see Santow and Singh, 1984, and Singh
and Ferry, 1984). Whether similar differences between the extent of full and
partial breastfeeding are behind the lack
of a closer correspondence between the
two estimates for the other countries is
impossible to determine without more
complete information on infant feeding
practices than was collected in the
World Fertility Survey for these countries. This must remain an unanswered
question for the time being.

To some extent, the urban-rural differences in postpartum amenorrhea as
estimated from the Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys conform with differences
in the duration of breastfeeding indicated by the World Fertility Survey.
World Fertility Survey results are available for all the same countries for which
we provide urban-rural estimates of
postpartum amenorrhea except Honduras. These results indicate longer breastfeeding on the average in rural than in
urban areas in all such countries (Ferry
and Smith, 1983). Based on mean current status estimates for all births, the
rural-urban difference in breastfeeding
duration was only two months for Costa
Rica and only three months for Colombia, while in both Peru and Korea, a difference of six months is indicated.
World Fertility Survey estimates of
rural-urban difference in breastfeeding
duration are also available for Sn Lanka
and Thailand where the indicated differences are five and eleven months, respectively. The fact that a much larger
 

Vol. 31, No. 3-4

rural-urban difference in breastfeeding
than in postpartum amenorrhea is indicated for Thailand can probably be attributed, at least in part, to the early introduction of supplementary foods by
both rural and urban women, and thus
to the lack of any significant rural-urban
difference in “full” breastfeeding (Knodel et al., 1982).

CONCLUSIONS

2015

Data collected in Contraceptive
Prevalence Surveys for a number of deEveloping countries on how long a
owoman experienced her last menstruastion, or on how soon following birth
menstruation returned, appear to yield
~reasonable national level estimates of
“the duration of postpartum amenor“thea. They provide important informasion on the nonsusceptible period fol‘lowing birth, an important proximate
‘Sdeterminant of fertility for which few
‘sprevious data have been available. The
monthly current status technique clearly
is improved by the availability of sub2stantial numbers of cases so that reliable
estimates can be obtained; it thus bezeomes less appropriate for estimating
differentials among subgroups in the
‘typical fertility survey sample, or even
national-level values for small-scale surZveys. The prevalence technique, which
yields less information, suffers from this

problem since it utilizes a larger propor
tion of the sample for the calculation of

the mean duration. The present results

suggest that there is considerable crossnational variation in the median and
mean duration of postpartum amenorrhea, and that estimating it from information on breastfeeding alone might be
misleading, especially if information on
the pattern of breastfeeding (full versus
partial) is not known. More direct estimates, such as those which can be made
based on the types of data analyzed in
the present study, add important information to our understanding of the proximate determinants of fertility as they
operate in specific developing countries.
