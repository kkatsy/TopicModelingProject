ABSTRACT: Genetic counseling, second trimester amniocentesis, reliable techniques for analyzing
fetal amniotic fluid and selective abortion together have the potential to prevent a variety of
serious birth defects. Advances in technique and/or changing patterns of childbearing may place a
large number of women in age groups where genetic counseling programs are recommended.
However, attitudes toward abortion may be a critical variable in ascertaining the potential of
genetic counseling programs to reduce birth defects. If opposition to abortion is based on a moral
commitment, greater awareness of genetic counseling programs will lead to opposition to these
programs. If attitudes toward abortion are based upon an evaluative process, such opposition is
less likely to occur. Using a sample of women from the Rochester, New York, area (V = 1,616)
whose attitudes toward abortion match U.S. estimates, we find that the greater the knowledge
about prenatal screening, the less prevalent are attitudes opposed to abortion in circumstances
necessary for birth defect reduction. This relationship holds when controlled for religion and
family size. We conclude that educational and counseling programs concerning the potential
benefits of prenatal screening are unlikely to arouse opposition to these programs.

In this paper we report findings concerning how attitudes toward abortion,

Genetic counseling, coupled with second trimester amniocentesis and _ reli
 

 

able techniques for analyzing fetal amniotic fluid, have resulted in unprecedented
possibilities for prenatal detection and
prevention of a variety of serious birth
defects. Studies have been published
documenting safety and reliability, defining specific indications (NICHD, 1976;
Simpson et al., 1976), and detailing technical results of chromosomal and biochemical analyses of cultured fetal cells and
amniotic fluid (Milunsky, 19755, 1976;
Nadler, 1976) as well as cost-benefit analyses (Hagard and Carter, 1976; Conley
and Milunsky, 1975). However, there is a
lack of information concerning factors
which influence acceptability of these procedures by expectant couples.

knowledge of possibilities for prenatal
screening, and certain other factors influence acceptance of prenatal diagnostic
procedures. Our analysis supports the
conclusion that educational and counseling approaches concerning the benefits,
availability, and applicability of prenatal
diagnosis may facilitate wider use of
prenatal screening as a means of reducing
the prevalence of some types of serious
birth defects.

culturing of fetal cells from amnietic fluid
soon followed (Steele and Breg, 1966;
Thiede et al., 1966). Second trimester amniocentesis was soon used to detect fetal
chromosomal abnormalities (Jacobson and
Barter, 1967; Valenti et al., 1968) as well
as heritable fetal inborn errors of metabolism (Nadler, 1968; Fujimoto, 1968). Additional techniques have been developed
so that prenatal diagnosis is now possible
for all observable chromosomal abnormalities, especially trisomy 21 (“mongolism”), and for an increasing number of
developmental and heritable biochemical
disorders such as spina bifida or anencephaly, and Tay-Sachs disease (Milunsky,
1975b; Nadler, 1976).

Although these fundamental procedures
for culture of amniotic fluid cells during
the second trimester and for cytogenetic
and biochemical analyses of fetal abnormality have been available for nearly a
decade, only a small fraction of pregnant
women at risk are currently provided
prenatal diagnostic services. For example,
in Massachusetts where prenatal diagnosis
has been pioneered on a statewide basis,
only 4.1 per cent of women 35 years of age
and over had prenatal chromosomal studies during 1974 (Milunsky, 1976). Nadler
has estimated that amniocentesis is available to less than 1 per cent of the relevant
national population (Nadler, 1976).

Important reasons for delay .in widespread use of these techniques included
lack of awareness by both physicians and
patients, and perhaps more importantly,
lack of information concerning potential
fetal and maternal] risks of the diagnostic
procedures (Milunsky, 1975b). Risk associated with the amniocentesis procedure is
an important consideration in the decision
to recommend amniocentesis since the
frequencies of many detectable abnormalities associated with advancing maternal age are generally low.

The results of two recent national stud

289

ies (U.S. and Canada), comparing approximately two thousand pregnant women
who had second trimester amniocentesis
for prenatal diagnosis with two thousand
“control” pregnant women who did not,
have documented the safety of second
trimester transabdominal amniocentesis,
finding that there is a less than 1 per cent
chance of serious fetal or maternal complications (NICHD, 1976; Simpson et al.,
1976). No significant differences were observed in frequencies of maternal infections, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths,
congenital malformations, or development
of offspring examined at one year of age.
Comparative evaluation of frequencies
of detectable fetal abnormalities and of the
risks associated with second trimester abdominal amniocentesis has led to the recommendation that women who are 35
years of age and older or who have had a
previous offspring with detectable birth
defects could benefit from prenatal screening (NICHD, 1976; Simpson et al., 1976;
Cooper, 1976). Over 140,000 children
were born to women aged 35 and older in
1975, comprising about 5 per cent of all
childbearing in the United States (calculation by authors from U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1978, p. 11, and Taffel, 1977, p.
27). Thus, recommended utilization of
prenatal screening services is substantially
greater than past usage would indicate.
Two separate considerations suggest
that the numbers of women who could
benefit from prenatal screening will increase, perhaps substantially, in future
years. First, safety of the diagnostic procedures may improve significantly. For
example, one line of current research is
exploiting the knowledge that smal] numbers of fetal blood cells cross the placenta
during early pregnancy and enter the
mother’s circulatory system (Shroder and
Herzenberg, 1977; Doherty and Horan,
1978). If procedures can be developed to
isolate and analyze these fetal cells from a

290 Sell et al.

sample of the pregnant woman’s blood,
the safety of the diagnostic procedure will
become comparable to that of a simple
blood test. A negligible risk associated
with the prenatal screening procedure itself would promote the possibility that the
majority of pregnant women in the future
might choose to have prenatal screening.

Demographic factors suggest a second
manner in which the numbers of women
who could benefit from prenatal screening
may increase. Although period fertility
rates in the United States are currently
extremely low among all age groups of
women (Nationa! Center for Health Statistics, 1977, pp. 1-9), two factors suggest
that future births to women over 30 years
of age may become more numerous. First,
the number of women in the age group
30—40 years will increase during the next
decade, representing the delayed impact of
the “baby boom” of the 1940’s and 1950's.
Second, the figure for average lifetime
births expected for all women, both married and nonmarried, is still more than
two children per woman (U.S. Bureau of
the Census, 1977, p. 9). Thus, although
period married fertility is below the level
of population replacement, if substantial
numbers of women in the age group 20-30
years fulfill their stated birth expectations,
childbearing among women over 30 is
likely to be greater in the near future than
it has been during the preceding decade.
Therefore, potential increases in demand
for prenatal screening are likely to occur,
both due to a probable increase in the
safety of the technique and due to a likely
increase in childbearing among older
women with a higher risk for certain
detectable fetal birth defects.

However, the effects of increased diffusion of knowledge about the circumstances
in which prenatal diagnosis is medically
acceptable, coupled with an increase in
the number of pregnant women in these
categories, might not increase the frequen
Social Biology

cles of detected birth defects. Although a
major benefit of prenatal diagnosis is parental reassurance concerning the absence
of serious fetal abnormality, counseling
concerning the potential uses of prenatal
diagnosis is often coupled with the realization that prenatal screening can prevent
birth defects only if used in conjunction
with elective abortion. Since potential
public health benefits of prenatal screening as a preventive health approach derive
from decreased expenditures for support
of severely incapacitated individuals, the
proportion of women at risk who decide
not to abort abnormal fetuses is an important parameter for estimating the overall
impact of prenatal screening on reduction
of certain types of detectable birth defects
in the population at large. Acceptance of
prenatal screening is therefore intertwined
with attitudes toward elective abortion
and the circumstances under which
couples are willing to abort a fetus diagnosed as abnormal. In particular, new low
risk procedures may not substantially increase the number of prenatal screenings if
substantial numbers of women are opposed to any procedures where benefits are
in part derived through the abortion of the
abnormal fetuses.

ATTITUDES TOWARD ABORTION

As stated by Tietze and Lewit (1977, p.
21), “Over the past 10 years in many countries abortion has changed from a largely
disreputable practice into an accepted
medical one, from a subject of gossip into
an openly debated public issue.” Responses to attitudinal surveys conducted
during this period suggest that attitudes
toward abortion have changed toward approval of legal abortion for a greater number of reasons. Of direct concern to
prenatal screening programs is the percentage of persons believing legal abortions should be available to women with a

Vol. 25, No. 4

strong probability of giving birth to a
deformed or defective child. Although
question wording and coding’ vary
somewhat, making the results not strictly
comparable, in the early 1960’s about 70
per cent of American adults approved of
legal abortions for this reason (Blake,
1971, p. 541), while in 1975 80 per cent
approved (Arney and Trescher, 1976).

Not surprisingly, attitudes toward abortion differ when characteristics such as
education and religion are considered.
Catholics, persons with relatively less
education, nonwhites, and persons from
rural areas tend to approve of abortion less
often than do Protestants, the more educated, whites, and persons from urban/
suburban areas (Arney and Trescher,
1976). Attitudes toward abortion by age
have changed since the early 1960's. Initially, surveys found that older persons
were less likely to disapprove of abortion
than were younger persons. Arney and
Trescher (1976, p. 121) report that after
1972 younger age groups are more favorable toward abortion than older groups,
reflecting a change toward the more
widespread approval of abortion in a
greater number of circumstances among
younger groups.

In summary, in 1975 about 80 per cent
of American adults approved of legal
abortion if a fetus had been diagnosed as
defective. Less certain, however, is how
these attitudes would relate to behavior in
a prenatal screening program.' On one
hand, opposition to abortion may decrease
significantly when a woman is presented
with the likely consequences of having to
care for a seriously defective baby. This

! The relationship between attitudes toward abortion and incidence of elective abortion is little studied. Swigar et al. (1977) report on a group of women
who had applied for an induced hospital abortion.
Women from this group who later gave birth were
compared with those aborting. The major significant
differences indicated that dropouts and their partners
were somewhat less educated than were women who
eventually had an abortion.

Attitudes Toward Abortion

reasoning suggests that attitudes toward
abortions would underestimate the number of women for whom prenatal screening would be utilized. On the other hand,
survey questions on attitudes toward abortion have concentrated on attitudes toward availability of legal abortions. It is
possible that attitudinal opposition to legal
abortion may overestimate the number of
women who would consider an abortion
for themselves. Approval of the legal
availability of abortion may not mean that
a particular woman or couple would consider an abortion appropriate in the specified circumstances.

To orient subsequent discussion and
analysis, we will hypothesize that individual opposition to abortion may be the result of two somewhat different modes of
orientation to the issues involved. Opposition may be the result of a direct ideological and/or religious commitment to oppose
abortion on the grounds that it is an inherently immoral act. Opposition to abortion
for this reason would also suggest opposition to prenatal screening. However, opposition may also result from more or less
reasoned judgment concerning perceived
costs, benefits, responsibilities, and alternatives in a given situation.2 This latter
interpretation of the origins of opposition
to abortion is suggested by the several surveys which indicate that less than 10 per
cent of adults are opposed to abortion
under all circumstances presented to respondents (Arney and Trescher, 1976, p.
118).3

It is desirable to know how considerations of the existence and uses of

2 For an excellent in-depth study of how abortion
is placed within the context of a woman’s overall
reproductive behavior, see Luker (1975).

3 Our categorization of opposition to abortion in
terms of a consideration of absolute values or in
terms of a more situationally determined decision
process is essentially the same as Max Weber’s wellknown distinction between Wertrationalitat and
Zweckrationalitat (Weber, 1947, p. 115; Parsons,
1937, pp. 640ff).

prenatal screening for fetal abnormalities
relate to attitudes toward abortion and
furthermore whether those relationships
appear to be based on a moral commitment or a judgmental evaluative process.

_ Attitudes concerning the availability of

legal abortions have been shown to vary
according to the circumstances surrounding conception and/or the contemplated
abortion, but widespread awareness of the
potentialities of prenatal screening has not
been one of the circumstances evaluated in
previous research. Information concerning
the relationship between knowledge of
prenatal screening possibilities and attitudes toward abortion under circumstances of probable fetal abnormality is
required as part of the overall estimation
of the potential benefits of prenatal screening in more widespread programs aimed at
the reduction of birth defects.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

THE DATA SAMPLE

The data used to investigate the relationships discussed above are based on
responses to questionnaires completed
during the spring of 1977 by 1,616 women
aged 30 to 45 residing in Monroe County
(Rochester, New York) and five nearby
counties. The sample is not random.
However, it was drawn in a systematic
fashion and departures from randomness
are known. Most importantly, crucial
tabulations are comparable to tabulations
using samples representative of the United
States adult population, leading us to
believe that, in spite of deviations from
randomness, our data are representative.

In the Rochester area, Blue Cross conducts a periodic sample survey of its
subscribers in order to estimate coverage
and other pertinent data. Blue Cross estimates that coverage is 80 per cent of the
population under 65 years old. A 3 per
cent sample of family contract subscribers

Sell et al.

Social Biology

was surveyed in 1976. If women aged 30
to 45 were reported as covered, a questionnaire was mailed to them to obtain
information concerning their knowledge of
prenatal screening and attitudes toward
abortion. After two mailings and a
telephone contact, questionnaires were obtained from 73.5 per cent (V = 1,616) of
these women. The original Blue Cross
survey had a response rate of 90 per cent,
resulting in an overall response rate of 66
per cent (0.900 X 0.735).

Obvious concern about the impact of a
sample which represents only about twothirds of the target population has led to
detailed evaluation of probable biases
(Roghmann, 1978). Response rates were
higher (1) among the youngest and oldest
age groups of women (i.e., women aged 30
or 31 and 44 or 45), (2) among residents of
the higher socioeconomic status neighborhoods, and (3) if women were spouses
of subscribers rather than the subscribers
themselves. No bias was found in response
rates by family size or the number of
previous hospitalizations.

However, our main justification for
believing the sample is nonetheless representative results from the level of
agreement between certain tabulations
made with these data and published
results from representative samples of the
U.S. adult population. This information is
presented in the Results section of this
paper (Table 1).

ATTITUDE MEASUREMENT

Attitudes toward abortion were obtained by “yes” or “no” responses to a
question asking: “Do you think a pregnant
woman should be able to obtain a legal
abortion under any of the following circumstances?” The circumstances listed are
those used in previous research measuring
attitudes toward abortion (e.g., “If there is
a strong chance of serious defect in the
baby”) (see Arney and Trescher, 1976, p.

 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 25, No. 4

118) plus two additional circumstances.
These were: “If a couple does not want to
have a child at this time,” and “If a couple
does not want a child of the sex (boy or
girl) that was diagnosed before birth.”
These items form an 8-item Guttman scale
(Nie et al., 1975, p. 528) with a coefficient
of reproducibility equal to 0.96. The resultant scale is a summation of the number of
“yes” responses. For analysis, the scale has
been collapsed into three categories, with
women giving 0 to 2 approvals classed as
“opposed” to abortion, 3 or 4 approvals
classes as “moderate,” and 5 to 8 approvals classed as “favorable” to abortion.

The attitude “opposed” essentially represents respondents who state that they do
not think a legal abortion should be available under the circumstances of a diagnosed fetal abnormality. Factors associated with this “opposed group” are of
particular importance to prenatal screening programs and will be the focus of subsequent analysis.

Two different scales were constructed to
measure knowledge of prenatal screening
for fetal abnormalities. The first scale
measures the level of knowledge about the
categories of people who should consider
prenatal screening in the sense that the
physical risks of amniocentesis are less
than potential benefits. The second measures knowledge about which abnormalities are generally recognized by medical professionals as detectable by these
screening procedures.

The initial question on the questionnaire asked: “Most babies are born
healthy, but a few may have birth defects
(congenital malformations or abnormalities
seen soon after birth). Do you know
whether there is now a medical test available to tell before a baby is born (prenatal
diagnosis) if it will have a birth defecte”
Responses of “yes,” “no,” and “don’t
know” were allowed. The next question
asked “In your view, who should have

Attitudes Toward Abortion

293

prenatal diagnosis?” and was followed by
six choices ranging from “all women” to
“women with a history of birth defects in
husband’s family” (see Table 3). Guttman
analysis of these seven items resulted in a
coefficient of reproducibility of 0.88 and
the sum of the medically appropriate answers (see note to Table 3) was used to
form a scale. A set of categories was
formed to represent level of knowledge of
who should have prenatal screening by
grouping women with 0 to 4 correct responses as “low,” 5 correct as “moderate,”
and 6 or 7 correct as a “high” level of
knowledge.

The second group of items used to measure knowledge of prenatal screening were
the responses to the question “Can each of
the following be detected in the baby (fetus) before birth? A list of items (see
Table 3) followed with response choices of
“yes,” “no” and “don’t know” provided.
“Don’t know” and missing responses have
been categorized as incorrect for scale
construction purposes, and the sum of correct responses to these items plus the question concerning the availability of the
diagnostic procedure itself were used to
form a scale of the knowledge of abnormalities detectable by the screening procedures. Again, a set of categories was
formed by grouping women with 0 to 2
correct as “low” knowledge, 3 to 5 as
“moderate” knowledge, and 6 through 12 as
“high” level of knowledge about detectable fetal abnormalities.

presented circumstances in all but one case
deviate from each other by only a few
points. In the deviant case, it turns out
that the question was asked differently in
the two surveys. In the NORC survey the
situation was listed as “If the family has a
very low income and cannot afford any
more children.” Fifty per cent of U.S.
adults in 1975 thought legal abortion
should be available under that situation.
In the Rochester survey we asked “if the
family cannot afford another child,” and
41 per cent approve of legal abortion
under those circumstances. Apparently
more approval is elicited if the situation
indicates the family cannot afford another
child and is also poor. This differential

degree of approval for this item appears
reasonable, and we therefore conclude
that the data in Table 1 from the sample of
Rochester area women is likely to be representative of the U.S. adult population as
well. Additional tabulations reported
below also support this conclusion.
Table 2 presents the findings regarding
differences in attitudes toward abortion by
religion of respondent. In agreement with
previous studies, Catholic women are
most likely and Protestant women least
likely to be opposed to abortion. About
one-third of Catholic women are opposed
to abortion in circumstances including the
reasonable probability of a child with a
birth defect. Although this represents the

greatest degree of opposition, it should be
noted that this is still a minority, with fully
two-thirds of Catholic women not opposed
to abortion for reasons relevant to prenatal
screening in spite of Catholic institutional
support for this position. This is highly
suggestive that other and perhaps stronger
factors have an important influence upon
attitudes toward abortion among Catholic
individuals.*

Previous research has demonstrated
that family size is related to attitudes toward abortion and in particular that family size is an intervening variable in the
relationship between religion and attitudes
toward abortion (Hedderson et al., 1974;
Renzi, 1975). Using a 1972 sample of
Americans Renzi’s _ cross-tabulations
showed that Protestant and Catholic attitudes toward abortion are more similar
within homogeneous ideal family size
groups. Hedderson et al. (1974, p. 272),
using the same data and path analysis
techniques, found that family size is a
more important intervening variable
among Catholic women than among
non-Catholic women.

The findings of Renzi (1975) and Hedderson et al. (1974) were confirmed in
tabulations with the present sample. For
women of all religions with zero or one
child, 21 per cent are opposed to abortion
whereas among women with three or more
children the level of opposition increases
to 29 per cent. For Catholic women, the
relationship between family size and attitudes toward abortion is also observed.
For example, 31 per cent of Catholic
women with small families are opposed to
abortion and 37 per cent of those with
large families are opposed. Among Protestant women there was no substantial rela
‘ The secularization of Catholic reproductive decisions has been noted in other contexts. Level of use of
the birth control pill among Catholic women, a clear
violation of the 1968 papal encyclical, is almost indistinguishable from level of use among non-Catholic
women (Westoff, 1973, p. 19).

tionship between family size and attitudes
toward abortion.

The data discussed above serve two
purposes. First, these data substantiate
previous findings relating attitudes toward
abortion with characteristics such as religion and family size (Arney and Trescher,
1976; Renzi, 1975; Hedderson et al.,
1974). Second, and more important for
this paper, these findings demonstrate that
relationships among crucial variables are
the same as those existing among the general adult population. Although our sample technically represents women aged 30
to 45 in one geographic area, our findings
to this point show that this sample accurately reproduces relationships based upon
representative samples of American
adults.

KNOWLEDGE OF PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS

The first question in the survey concerning knowledge of prenatal diagnosis
asked: “Do you know whether there is
now a medical test available to tell before a
baby is born (prenatal diagnosis) if it will
have a birth defect?” Eighty-five per cent
(1381/1616) responded that they knew
such tests existed, a relatively high proportion. However, as subsequent results will
show, the level of specific knowledge
about prenatal diagnosis is generally low.

Table 3 lists the per cent correct responses of women to questions concerning
who should have prenatal diagnosis and
which birth defects are detectable. A majority of the respondents answered that all
women should have prenatal diagnosis.
Although medically not recommended at
the present time, this view would not hinder prenatal screening programs nor endanger potential mothers in any way since
professional contact would correct this belief at the appropriate time.

Greater concern can be directed to the
results which show that only 57 per cent
responded that women over 35 should

t Responses of “No Answer,” or “Don’t Know” were considered as incorrect “Don’t Know” was the modal response on some items The
primary purpose of this hstis to indicate coding procedures We are aware that on certain items there 1s an element of uncertainty as to whether or
not the abnormality 1s detectable with sufficient rehabilty to justify the statement that the answers are medically correct under all circumstances
For example, sickle cell anemia is detectable, but current procedures are considered expernmental

have prenatal diagnosis; similarly only 71
per cent responded that women over 40
should have such diagnosis. It should be
remembered that the sample consists of
women between the ages of 30 and
45—the age group of women for whom
prenatal diagnosis is most relevant.
Clearly, substantial numbers of women in
the relevant age group are not aware or do
not think that pregnant women in this age
group could benefit from prenatal screening.>

Table 3 also shows the level of know!ledge concerning which fetal characteristics are generally detectable through
prenatal diagnosis. Only for Down’s syndrome and fetal sex were the majority of
women in the sample aware of the correct
response. Our data show that few women
are aware of the specific abnormalities
detectable before birth.

5 An objection could be raised that these women
are unaware of the appropriateness of prenatal diagnosis because they plan no more pregnancies and
hence this knowledge is not salient to them Not
surprising for women between 30 and 45, 88 per cent
planned no more pregnancies. However, the relationship between future pregnancy plans, categorized as “do not plan more or don’t know” and
“plan more children,” and the knowledge scale was
not statistically significant.

KNOWLEDGE OF PRENATAL SCREENING
AND ATTITUDES TOWARD ABORTION

Table 4 presents a cross-tabulation of
attitudes toward abortion and degree of
knowledge about who should have
prenatal diagnosis. The two items are
clearly related. Among those women with
a high degree of knowledge about who
should have prenatal diagnosis, 17 per
cent are opposed to abortion. Among those
with a low degree of knowledge, the opposition to abortion doubles, increasing to
34 per cent. If opposition to abortion were
the direct result of an ideological position,
there would be no reason to expect the
relationship found in Table 4. However, if
attitudes toward abortion are substantially
the result of an evaluative process which
takes into account actualities of the
childbearing, then knowledge of prenatal
diagnosis would be likely to affect this
decision process in ways to increase the
acceptance of abortion.

In Table 5 attitudes toward abortion
have been cross-tabulated with knowledge
of detectable characteristics. The relationship is the same as that noted in Table 4,
although not nearly as strong. It should be
remembered that most women could not
correctly identify detectable fetal abnor

We have previously suggested that on a
general level, opposition to abortion may
be characterized as the result of either a
moral commitment or the result of reasoned judgment. Among our sample as
with previous sample surveys, Catholic
women have been shown to be more opposed to abortion than were Protestant
women. Given the position of Catholic
doctrine, the relationship would appear as
a prima facie indication of an ideological
relationship between religion and opposition to abortion.

However, data presented in Table 6
documents that this is not completely the
case. In Table 6, the relationship between
attitudes toward abortion and knowledge
concerning who should have prenatal diagnosis has been controlled for religion. If
religion were the sole determinant of attitudes toward abortion, the relationship
between attitudes toward abortion and
knowledge would have _ disappeared
(Davis, 1971, p. 82). However, based upon
both inspection of the tables and the summary statistics, the relationship is the
same among all women and among both
Catholics and Protestants. That is, both
among Protestants and Catholics increasing knowledge of prenatal diagnosis is related to decreasing opposition to abortion.
To be sure, Catholics are still more likely
to be opposed to abortion, but these data
indicate that differences in knowledge
have similar impact upon attitudes toward
abortion regardless of religion.

 

Social Biology

Further analyses were performed to
substantiate the findings in Table 6. First
the relationship between attitudes toward
abortion and knowledge was controlled
for family size (data not shown).’ The relationship was maintained in all three family
size categories with contingency coefficients of 0.23, 0.17, and 0.17 for small,
moderate, and large families, respectively.
Again, knowledge influences attitudes
independent of family size.

Second, the relationship between attitudes toward abortion and knowledge of
who should have prenatal diagnosis was
simultaneously controlled for both religion
and family size. A summary of these
results is presented in Table 7. The rows
in Table 7 represent the “opposed” row of
the 6 cross-tabulations between attitudes
toward abortion and knowledge of who

7 Family-size categories were small (O~1 child),

medium (2 or 3 children), and large (4 or more children).

* This table summarizes six cross-tabulations of attitudes toward abortion by knowledge of women who should have prenatal screening within
religions and family-size groups Contingency coefficients (C) and x? significance refer to the complete 3 x 3 tables Marginal opposition refers to
the overall per cent opposing abortion within the specified religion/family size category (e g , 18 1 per cent of Protestants with small families oppose

abortion)

should have prenatal screening. The relationship between level of knowledge and
attitude identified earlier is substantially
confirmed when both religion and family
size are held constant. Some of the relationships are no longer statistically significant, but even in these cases the previous relationship holds. All but one contingency coefficient are approximately
equal to the coefficient in the first order
relationship (Table 4, C = 0.18) with one
exception; the relationship between abortion attitudes and knowledge among small
family Protestant women shows a stronger
relationship (C = 0.38). These findings
suggest that ideological commitment represents at most only a portion of the opposition to abortion and that a low level of
knowledge about prenatal screening is
consistently associated with a greater
likelihood of opposition to abortion.

CONCLUSIONS

We initially suggested that attitudes toward abortion may result from moral

commitments or from a more situationally
circumscribed decision process. The distinction is crucial in the consideration of
the potential acceptance of prenatal
screening on a widespread basis. If attitudes toward abortion were grounded in
some form of moral commitment, then
educational and/or counseling campaigns
to provide awareness of the potential
benefits of prenatal screening might have
the opposite effect. Increased awareness of
the complete prenatal screening program,
including the possible decision for elective
abortion to prevent serious birth defects,
might precipitate opposition to prenatal
screening on the basis of the abortion issue. However, if attitudes toward abortion are the result of a decision process
encompassing a variety of factors, including the potential reduction in the likelihood of giving birth to a seriously defective child, then educational and prenatal
counseling programs would be likely to
increase the demand for prenatal screening.

Throughout the preceding analysis,
abortion attitudes were categorized such

that “opposed” to abortion essentially represented stated disapproval under situations where either the woman’s health is
endangered or there is a strong possibility
of an abnormal fetus. Given this categorization, our data show that increased
knowledge of prenatal screening is associated with a decrease in opposition to
abortion under circumstances relevant to
the utilization of prenatal screening to reduce the incidence of birth defects.

However, a word of caution is indicated. The survey methodology used in
this research only allows statements about
associations between the attitudes toward
abortion and the level of knowledge about
prenatal screening. For predictive purposes it would be desirable to know how a
change in level of knowledge about the
risks and benefits of prenatal screening
influences the acceptability of these procedures. Furthermore, specific questions
should be answered about the interaction
between obstetric and genetic counseling
concerning potential benefits of prenatal
screening and attitudes toward a prenatal
screening program aimed at reducing the
incidence of birth defects. Issues such as
these can only be answered within a
longitudinal analysis framework which
includes the clinical setting.

Sell et al.

Social Biology

However, given that the relationship identified in this research remained
relatively stable when controlled for important characteristics, the data analyzed
indicate that any action which increases
the awareness of benefits of prenatal
screening would be likely to lead to a
greater demand for such services. Thus,
provision of information concerning possible uses of prenatal screening as a part of
routine prenatal care should lead to
increased demand for these services. This
indicates an urgent need for reliable data
to accurately estimate future utilization of
prenatal diagnostic services so that appropriate planning for provision of personnel
and facilities can be provided. Increased
public and professional awareness of
prenatal screening possibilities combined
with the necessary facilities could lead to a
substantial reduction in birth defects in
areas where such programs are successfully implemented.
