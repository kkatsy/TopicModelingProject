ABSTRACT: Distributions of the incidence of anencephaly in Japan were obtained using nationwide data on fetal and postnatal deaths of individuals with anencephaly during 1969-71. Higher
incidences of anencephaly occurred in the urbanized and industrialized areas and lower values
in the comparatively sparsely populated highlands. Population size and variance of incidence
show a negative association. The distribution of the incidence seems to be binomial, and expected incidences based on binomial distribution indicated good agreement with weighted mean
incidences in populations with different sizes. The rate of first cousin marriages among the
parents of anencephalic patients is 1.86 per cent, a value not significantly different from the
value of general population, 2.13 per cent. It seems that the inheritance of anencephaly is not

related to a specific number of recessive genes.

Penrose (1957) noted wide geographical
variation in the frequencies of malformations of the central nervous system among
different countries and regions. Imaizumi
(1974) has reported that the incidence of
anencephaly is higher in northeast than in
southwest rural Japan, but the mean anencephalic incidences in urban and rural areas
are very similar.

According to Carter (1969), the etialogy
of anencephaly is a multifactorial inheritance involving both genetic and environmental factors. Only 7.5 per cent of the
anencephalic fetuses were liveborn, and all
of them died within the first month after
birth (Imaizumi, 1974). Therefore, this
malformation is a lethal disease. The parents of offspring with anencephaly seem to
be normal individuals in appearance. Almost all studies on the sex ratio in anencephaly report more females to be affected
than males (Timson, 1970). In Japan, the
per cent of anencephalic infants who are

66

males varies from 47 to 55, and the chisquare value between anencephalic fetal
deaths and fetal deaths in the general population (57 per cent) is statistically significant at the 0.1 per cent level (Imaizumi,
1974),

When the size of a population is small,
the incidence of a rare disease will tend to
take on a value either too low (say, 0) or
too high because of the sample size. Therefore, it is important to know the size of
population in order to estimate the incidence. The present study deals with the
distribution of the incidence of anencephaly
for different population sizes and the etiology of this disorder.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

There are two sources of data available
for the present analysis. First, data consisting of 2,489 fetal deaths with anencephaly reported during the period 1969
to 1971, inclusive have been obtained from
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

Vol. 23, No. 1

the fetal death certificate records kept at
the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Second, the data consisting of 172 postnatal
deaths with anencephaly reported during
1969 to 1971 and taken from the death certificate records kept at the Ministry of
Health and Welfare were utilized in this
study. Data on the general population were
taken from the annual volumes of Vital
Statistics of Japan for the years 1969-71
(Japan, Ministry of Health and Welfare,
1971, 1972, 1973).

The total number of cases of anencephaly
was divided into 1,211 wards, cities, or gun,
according to the place of residence. A gun
consists of approximately six towns and/or
villages. In computing the incidence of anencephaly, the reported number of deaths
ascribed to this malformation was divided
by the total number of fetal deaths plus
live births corresponding to the same period in the general population.

RESULTS
GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF BIRTHS

Figure 1 shows the total number of anencephalic births in each ward, city, town,
and village according to the place of residence. It is obvious that anencephaly is
comparatively rare in the sparsely populated highlands. The incidence of anencephaly was computed for each ward, city,
or gun, The total number of administrative
units was arbitrarily divided into four different population sizes according to the
number of feta] deaths plus live births:
over 10,000, 5,000-10,000, 2,000—5,000,
and less than 2,000. As shown in Table 1,
the total numbers of administrative units
in these groups are 160, 165, 506, and 380,
respectively. The mean population sizes are
19,129, 6,739, 3,081, and 1,310, respectively.

Table 1 shows that the largest simple
mean incidence of anencephaly (0.00045)
is obtained in the group of the largest pop

of the other three groups take on a similar
value (0.00040). The chi-square value between the largest population size and the
others is statistically significant at the 1
per cent level.

It is also interesting to look at where
there is a higher risk of anencephaly in the
largest size population group. The 160 administrative units in the largest population
groups were subdivided into groups according to which one of the eight districts of
Japan they belonged to, and the anencephalic incidence and population density
were computed for these eight districts
(Table 2). The lowest population density

DISTRIBUTION OF THE INCIDENCE OF
ANENCEPHALY

Thirty-four per cent of 1,211 administrative units show zero incidence for
anencephaly. Weighted mean incidences
are 0.000451, 0.000408, 0.000405, and
0.000394 in order of large population size,
respectively. These values are similar for
weighted and simple mean values. On the
other hand, the variances of anencephalic
incidence are 3 & 10~8, 7 x 1078, 16x
10-8, and 42 X 10-8, according to the
above order. The mean population size and
variance of anencephalic incidence show a
negative association. Figure 2 shows the
distributions of the incidence of anencephaly

and anencephalic incidence is found in the
Hokkaido District. The highest population
densities are found in the Kanto and Kinki
districts where the incidences also show
higher values, 0.000461 and 0.000464, respectively. These two districts are the most
urbanized and industrialized areas in Japan.

for four different population sizes. From
Figure 2, the distribution of incidence
seems to be the binomial distribution. The
variance (V) of this distribution is (1 —
p)/N, where p and WN are the mean incidence of anencephaly and the population
size, respectively. The value of p is very
small, so that the value of V is approximately p/N. Therefore, the value of # is
equal to NV. Table 3 shows the relationship between the incidence of anencephaly
and NY (say, expected incidence), where

DISCUSSION

Consanguineous marriages are still common in Japan. According to Imaizumi
(1974), the incidence of anencephaly in
rural areas in Japan showed a gradient
from northeast to southwest. The inbreeding level is lower in the former area than
in the latter area (Imaizumi et al., 1975).
Therefore, the relationship between the
anencephalic and inbreeding levels shows
a negative association. On the other hand,
there was no excess in the incidence of anencephalic patients born to consanguineous
marriages (the present paper, and Schull,

Downloaded by [U

1958). On the basis of the above statements, it seems that the inheritance of
anencephaly is not related to a specific
number of recessive genes, a hypothesis
proposed by Timson (1972). Penrose
(1957) was against any single major-gene
hypothesis and has favored the polygenic
hypothesis.

Pleydell (1960) showed that there was
a higher incidence of anencephaly in urban
than in rural areas of Northamptonshire,
England. In the present paper, we have
shown that the incidence is higher in urbanized and industrialized areas than in
nonurbanized and nonindustrialized areas.
Again, looking at this problem from the
viewpoint of population density, the Chugoku District is not an overcrowded area.
However, there is located in that district
an industrial belt associated with the chemical industry.

SUMMARY

Distributions of the incidence of anencephaly were obtained using nationwide
data in Japan on fetal and postnatal deaths
of individuals with anencephaly during
1969-71. The largest incidence (0.00045)
was obtained in the largest population size
(larger than 10,000), and the chi-square
value between the largest population size
and the others is statistically significant
at the 1 per cent level. Higher incidences
of anencephaly occurred in the urbanized
and industrialized areas and lower values

The distribution of the incidence seems
to be the binomial, and expected incidences
based on binomial distribution indicated
good agreement with weighted mean incidences in populations with different sizes.

per cent. It seems that the inheritance of
anencephaly is not related to a specific
number of recessive genes.
