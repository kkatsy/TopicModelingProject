Breast-feeding, Social Variables,

ABSTRACT: This study is an attempt to use a hazards model to estimate the relative risks of
mortality experienced at different periods during the first year of life among Malaysian infants
breast-fed for various durations. Data on mortality, breast-feeding, and social variables were
obtained from the retrospective Malaysian Family Life Survey and were used after checking for
quality and consistency. Using LOGLIN to calculate hazards models, essentially multidimensional life-tables, we found that breast-feeding had an effect on mortality independent of socioeconomic variables and birth cohort. There was a monotonic relationship between breastfeeding duration and lower infant mortality during each of four subdivisions of the first year of
life. Breast-feeding was a statistically significant predictor of mortality in the first six months.
The results are compared with those from the Rand study, which employed regression rather
than hazards models.

extent to which breast-feeding in infancy actually confers a survival advantage 1n specific environments cannot be
deduced a priori. Analysis of the empirical effects of breast-feeding on infant
mortality must be carried out in diverse
settings and must take into account the
effects of other variables likely to have
an effect on feeding practices, infant
mortality, or both.

In European nations during the closing decades of the nineteenth century,
there apparently were large mortality
differentials between infants exclusively
bottle-fed and those exclusively breastfed. For example, in Berlin in 1895-96
the death rate in the former group was
376 per thousand, while in the latter it
was 57 (Knodel, 1977). The early studies
reviewed by Knodel ignore the possibility of confounding socioeconomic variables, but the consistent finding of the
protective effects of mother’s milk is of
interest. Recent research on breastfeeding in Western nations provides
equivocal evidence of breast-feeding’s
protective effects. Some studies have
found morbidity differentials (Douglas,
1950; Cunningham, 1977), while others
have not (Stevenson, 1947; RCGP,
1972; Adebonojo, 1972). Diet-related
mortality differentials have decreased
substantially since the late nineteenth
century, probably due to general improvements in the sanitary condition of
food and water supplies (McKeown,
1979).

Given the presumed importance of
sanitary improvements, and the association of such improvements with economic development, the impact of feeding practices on infant death rates
should be most important today in the
least developed nations. In fact, relatively few thorough studies of the relation of diet to infant mortality have been

Breast Feeding

79

carried out in such nations, and even
good morbidity studies are surprisingly
uncommon. Plank and Milanesi (1973)
found that in fifteen communities in
Chile the relative risk of post-neonatal
death among those solely bottle-fed was
three times that among babies who were
solely breast-fed. In one study of three
Arab villages, infants who had been
solely bottle-fed were hospitalized with
diarrhea almost fifty times as frequently
as those who were solely breast-fed (Kanaaneh, 1972). Much other work has
been flawed by small, biased, or unrepresentative samples. For example,
Dugdale (1971) found that breast-feeding had no relationship to morbidity in a
sample of 250 Malaysian infants, while
Manderson (1981, p. 175), on the contrary, ‘““. . . established a significant relationship between artificial feeding and
the incidence of gastroenteritis” in infancy and childhood among 244 patients
in a Malaysian hospital. However,
Dugdale used a sample from a clinic
population, perhaps consisting of mothers unusually knowledgeable and concerned about infant care, while Manderson based her conclusions upon proportions breast-fed among those hospitalized, without examining the corresponding proportion in any control
group.

An understanding of the health impact of breast-feeding in different social
and environmental circumstances is of
enormous value for policy-making, particularly in developing nations. The
present work is an attempt to estimate
diet-related mortality differentials from
multidimensional life tables, for a large
and representative sample of a welldefined population, while taking into account the effects of socioeconomic variables. A hazards models analysis is
particularly appropriate for the study of

breast-feeding and infant mortality.
Over the course of the first year of life,
the risk of dying usually exhibits a striking monotonic decline and endogenous
causes of mortality are supplanted by
exogenous ones. Therefore, the effects
of breast-feeding duration on infant
mortality should be modelled in a way
which permits the risks and causes of
dying to vary with time. Hazards model
analysis can be used to assess the significance of influences on the risks of dying
in various time intervals, taking into account the effects of a number of covariates (Trussell and Hammerslough,
1983). Many such studies, carried out in
varied settings, will be needed if policy
decisions concerning infant feeding
practice are to be established upon a
broad base of empirical evidence.

HAZARDS MODEL
METHODOLOGY

Following theoretical work by Laird
and Olivier (1981), Trussell and Hammerslough (1983) have illustrated how
life tables with covariates can be estimated and tested by fitting log-linear
multidimensional contingency table
models with LOGLIN, a computer program developed at the Harvard School
of Public Health. For the purposes of
mortality analysis, covariates are variables which are expected to be predictors
of death rates. LOGLIN calculates expected numbers of deaths for the cells of
a table of discrete categories, based
upon hierarchically specified models of
main effects and their interactions (Olivier and Neff, 1978). Maximum likelihood estimates of elementary cells are
computed by iterative proportional
fitting. Log-likelihood statistics show
the goodness-of-fit when comparing expected tables of deaths with the ob
Social Biology

served figures. This permits the identification of preferred models and
consequently of significant independent
variables and interactions. The dependent variable is the log of the death rate,
given as the sum of additive effects estimates. The ratio of exponentiated effects estimates provides a measure of
relative risk when comparing the different categories of a given variable, while
simultaneously controlling the effects of
the other variables.

Differences in log-likelihood statistics between two nested models, a pair
in which variables included in one model
are a Subset of those in the other, are distributed asymptotically as a chi-square
distribution and are tested with degrees
of freedom equal to the difference between the numbers of parameters in the
two models. The associated p-values
show how likely it is that the simpler
model is just as good at explaining the
observed distribution of deaths as the
more complex model, so when the pvalue is large we accept the model with
fewer variables or interactions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The Malaysian Family Life Survey
was carried out in 1976 among 1,262
households representative of the regions of Peninsular Malaysia (Butz and
DaVanzo, 1978). The Rand Corporation, Survey Research Malaysia, and the
Malaysian Government Department of
Statistics all participated. The part of
the survey used for this work was a retrospective questionnaire concerning
pregnancy histories, feeding practice,
and socioeconomic variables, answered
by ever-married women under 50 years
of age. In all, information on 5,593
births was available. Births were used as

the unit of analysis. A group of possible
mortality determinants was selected for
study on the basis of frequent mention
in the literature.

Table 1 displays the categories of
each of the hypothesized predictors of
infant mortality. In some cases variable
codes were collapsed due to small numbers. The variables used in the analysis
were breast-feeding history, use of other
food, birthweight, time period of birth,
sex, availability of piped water, and
birth order together with the length of
the prior closed birth interval. The age
of the mother at the time of the birth,
and her ethnic group and formal schooling, were included also.

Whenever possible, the representativeness of the sample was tested by
comparing the reported patterns of the
selected variables to national figures or
plausible limits. Survey distributions of
maternal age, ethnic group, piped water
availability, birth cohort, and schooling
were comparable to national distribu
tions (Chander et al., 1977; Fernandez
et al., 1975; Malaysia Dept. of Statistics,
1970; Ooi, 1976). The sex ratio at birth
was not significantly different from 105.
Reported parities by age and by ethnic
group were similar to WES figures
(Chander et al., 1977). Birthweights
were statistically shown to be normally
distributed in every cohort and ethnicity
subgroup, as is expected. Within each
subgroup, distributions of durations
breast-fed were heaped on multiples of
six months, but nonetheless did not differ significantly from the model breastfeeding distribution developed by Lesthaeghe and Page (1980). The infant
mortality rates showed some sampling
fluctuations when examined by birth cohort and ethnic group, but overall rates
by cohort were comparable to those in
Malaysian vital statistics reports (Sidhu
and Jones, 1981), and Haaga (1986) has
shown that the trends in time by ethnic
group in the Rand study are not generally different from national figures if

three-year moving averages are used to
smooth the curves.

The income variable seemed not to
be a good measure of socioeconomic
status. Fully half the women reported an
income of zero. While some of these
may be engaged exclusively in child care
in the home, others may be doing labor
on family-owned farms, while still others
may be employed on plantations or elsewhere outside the home for payment in
goods. Reported income was not correlated with the other measures known to
be good indicators of social standing in
Malaysia, such as ethnic group and
mother’s education. In view of the uncertainty of what the income variable
was measuring, it was not used.

Another variable also proved to be of
only limited use: the age at which “‘baby
first received food or drink regularly
other than breast milk’? (Fain and
Kheong, 1978). For 54 per cent of babies born in the sample, that age was reported as two months or Jess. No deaths
were reported after the start of the third
month among those receiving ‘“‘no other
foods,’”’ because of low rates and small
numbers. In the public use data tape, dietary alternatives to breast-feeding are
not specified, further limiting the utility
of the variable for this analysis.

STATISTICAL MODELLING

In fitting the hazards models to these
data, we made two critical decisions
about modelling. First, to provide adequate samples in subperiods of the first
year of life, analysis intervals were constructed starting at ages 0, 2, 4, and 7
months, and including up to 13 months
of exposure. All models are estimated
separately for each of the four intervals,
so that the changing importance of the
factors contributing to infant mortality
can be seen. Second, a breast-feeding

Social Biology

variable had to be created for each interval which would reflect each baby’s
feeding history as of the start of that
time period. The breast-feeding status
in the current interval, the interval for
which effects estimates were being calculated, was not included, because if a
child stopped breast-feeding in the interval in which it died, it would not be
clear whether cessation of nursing
caused the death or vice versa. An inherently biased variable could result.
For the first interval, the variable was dichotomous: the ever/never breast-fed
question was used.

For each interval, a main effects
model was fitted first. In each case a
highly significant fit compared to a fully
saturated model was obtained using the
chosen predictors, as shown in Table 2.
In order to fit a more parsimonious
model, and to test the relative importance of variables during different intervals, each variable was to be dropped
one at a time, and the loss of goodnessof-fit measured. However, it was important to test first for interactions in the
main effects model, lest variables be
dropped which have important effects
only in combination with others.

Several such interactions were subjected to testing, because of prior hypotheses. Ethnic group and cohort
might show a significant interaction if
the health conditions of the different
ethnic groups in Malaysia were improving at different rates. Ethnic differences
in mean birthweight were observed in
the data set and led to the testing of a
model with an ethnic group/birthweight
interaction term. It seemed reasonable
to expect an interaction between birthweight and breast-feeding because of
the presumed susceptibility of lowbirthweight infants to infection. If alternative foods were prepared with con

taminated water, we might expect an interaction between piped water and
breast-feeding. Finally, the interaction
between education and breast-feeding
was also tested. Table 3 compares the
model with all main effects with models
obtained when adding interactions to
them. Chi-square values and the applicable degrees of freedom are shown, together with the associated probability
levels. Remember that a small p-value
indicates a gain in fit with a more complex model. The only clearly significant
interaction occurs in the first interval,
where the joint effect of ethnic group
and birthweight is significant.

The set of runs in which variables
were dropped from the main effects
model one at a time is summarized in
Table 4. The numbers of persons and of
person-months of exposure in each interval, together with the number of
deaths, are also displayed.

To obtain parsimonious main effects
models, deaths in each analysis interval
were fitted using only the variables
which had caused a significant loss of fit
at the 10 per cent level when dropped individually from the complete main effects model for that interval. If the resulting model showed a significant loss
of fit at the 10 per cent level compared to
the complete main effects model, the
omitted variables were added back, in
decreasing order of significance, until a
model was obtained which did not provide a significantly poorer fit than the
model with ali main effects. The variables which are omitted from the parsimonious main effects model obtained
by this procedure are marked in Table 4.

The addition of selected interaction
terms to main effects models with nine
or ten variables had already been tested
for statistical significance. Could these
interactions significantly improve the fit

tality. The standard errors of the estimates are presented in Table 7. For the
first interval the preferred model is the
parsimonious main effects model with
the addition of the ethnic group/birthweight intersection term; for later intervals it is simply the parsimonious main
effects model. These models are preferred to those with more variables and to
fully saturated models on the grounds
that they explain observed distributions
of hazard rates quite well with relatively
few variables. At the same time, relatively liberal procedures have been used
to determine which variables should be
included. Tipping the balance in favor of
inclusion of variables seems justified in
view of the difficulty of detecting determinants of infant mortality differentials.

THE PRESENT WORK AND THE RAND
STUDY

The directions and general patterns
of effects estimates from the preferred
models provide useful information
about mortality determinants, even
though the inclusion of variables is
sometimes not statistically significant in
accordance with the strictest criteria. In
that sense this paper is an exploratory
analysis rather than a formal test of hypotheses. The results of this analysis will
be compared with the work of Butz,
DaVanzo, and Habicht of the Rand
Corporation (1982), who studied mortality determinants with the MFLS data
using linear probability regression equations. The findings of the two studies are
largely consistent. However, the Rand
study became available after the completion of this analysis, and a number of
differences make comparison difficult.

The dependent variable used in the
Rand study is a dichotomous dummy:
An individual either dies (coded as 1) or

Social Biology

does not (coded as 0). A linear relationship is assumed to exist between infant
mortality and its determinants. Problems of heteroscedasticity render estimation of a dummy-dependent variable
inefficient, and predicted values are not
necessarily between zero and one in linear probability regression. In the hazards model the dependent variable is the
logarithm of the death rate, related linearly to the covariates. Such models are
not direct transforms of one another.
Furthermore, in the Rand study, four
age intervals were used to subdivide the
first year of life, beginning at exact ages
0, 8 days, 1 month, and 6 months. As
discussed earlier, hazard models were
fitted for intervals beginning at 0, 2, 4,
and 7 months.

The Rand study also differs from the
present work in that stepwise procedures were not used to decide on the inclusion or exclusion of variables. Instead, Butz et al. (1982) calculated
regression equations separately for
three groups of variables and then for all
variables together. The three groups
were called biological attributes at birth,
postnatal biological influences, and indirect family influences. A set of variables
specified a priori was entered into each
linear regression equation for each interval. The findings from hazards
models are compared here only with
that regression equation which includes
all three classes of factors, except when
otherwise specified, because the variables in the hazards models fall into all
three categories.!

The coding schemes used for crucial
variables differ in the two studies. For

‘Butz et al. also calculated logit regression
equations including all three classes of factors, but
for that analysis all their intervals were combined.
We do not have a similar analysis for comparison.

dietary variables in particular the situation is confusing, owing to the possibility
of feeding both mother’s milk and other
food to an infant in a given period. In the
hazards models, a single variable represented the duration of breast-feeding
prior to the interval under study,
whether such breast-feeding was supplemented or not. As explained earlier,
only breast-feeding prior to the analysis
interval was considered, because if a
child died and stopped breast-feeding in
the same interval the direction of causality would be uncertain. A separate variable, “other food,” was a dummy variable indicating whether or not any solid
or liquid other than mother’s milk was
consumed by the infant.” This variable
was included in the first interval to allow
for the effects of early supplementation
or the complete failure to breast-feed.
Consumption of “other food” could not
be included in subsequent intervals, because after the first two months of life no
deaths occurred among those few babies
who had never received “other food.”
In the Rand study, durations of unsupplemented and supplemented
breast-feeding prior to the start of the
interval in question were entered as two
separate variables in each analysis, except that no variable reflecting feeding
practice was used in the first interval
(i.e., the first week of hfe). Breast
*Unlike the breast-feeding variable, ‘‘other
food” was dichatomous and referred to whether or
not other food than mother’s milk had been consumed by the end of the interval under study. Inclusion of experience in the analysis interval does
not introduce a truncation bias with this variable,
because the beginning rather than the end of a
feeding practice is in question. Since the sudden
exposure of the infant to new sources of infection
might be expected to have a large and immediate
impact, it was decided to forego the comparability
of the reference periods of the breast-feeding and
“other food” variables in favor of measuring the
mortality effect of ‘other food” in the interval of
maximum impact.

Social Biology

feeding durations were divided into onemonth categories for the last two intervals; for the second interval, information on days of breast-feeding in the first
week of life was apparently employed
(Butz et al., 1982, p. 12). The Rand coding scheme implicitly allows for three
possible dietary combinations in a given
interval: solely breast-fed, breast-fed
with supplementation, and never
breast-fed (those with a value of zero for
both variables). These regimens cannot
be fully differentiated in the hazards
analysis. However, the distribution of
Rand’s unsupplemented breast-feeding
variable is necessarily affected by the
same problem of sample size which
caused us to drop the “other food” variable, that is, only 16 per cent of babies
still recerved unsupplemented breastfeeding after the first two months of life,
and no deaths occurred among them.

In summary, there may be several
reasons for the differences observed between the findings of Butz et al. (1982)
and the hazards model analysis. First,
the statistical assumptions underlying
the models are different. Second, the
procedures used to determine which
variables to include in a model were different. Third, the narrow age intervals
used in analysis are different in the two
studies, exacerbating problems of sampling variability. Finally, the coding of
the variables in the two models may
have a most important effect on the findings. Nonetheless, the two studies show
results which are similar in substantively
important ways.

RESULTS

The preferred models for the first
three analysis intervals include breastfeeding as a predictor of infant mortality. It is a particularly significant deter

minant in the first and third intervals.
Consumption of mother’s milk is an especially great advantage in the first two
months of life, while consumption of
“other food” adds appreciably to risk,
according to the ratio of exponentiated
effects estimates. The relative risk of
dying among those who received food
other than mother’s milk is 6.26 compared to those who do not, and the in,, fant who was never breast-fed is twelve
= = Himes as likely to die as the infant who
‘‘ was breast-fed at some time. Several
3 factors probably account for these high
® relative risks. Early in life, the protectA ive effects of colostrum are at the maxico mum. Some babies might have special
cq problems leading to early cessation of
co breast-feeding, for example. Some in= fants may receive supplementary food in
"= an attempt to compensate for low birthE,weisht. The high risks of death among
S these classes of infants may be responsi= ble for the heavy mortality among those
i © who subsist in whole or in part on “other
2 = food. ”
For the next two intervals, in which
‘= breast-feeding adds significantly to the
= ~ fit of the model, the estimates of the rels ative risks of mortality among those who
2 had been breast-fed longest compared
& to the never breast-fed were 2.46 and
€ 7.28. These figures are less reliable than
A that for the first interval; the standard
O errors are much larger because later intervals have fewer deaths.

When breast-feeding is dropped
from the main effects model for the
fourth interval, the loss of fit is not statistically significant according to the preset criterion, so the factor is not included
in the preferred model for that interval.
However, Table 8 shows estimates for
the model with all main effects for that
interval, together with the corresponding standard errors. Note that even here

the effects estimates imply lower mortality risks when breast-feeding has been
longer. This pattern of effects estimates
is additional evidence in support of the
hypothesis that the relation between
breast-feeding duration and infant survival is positive and monotonic. The

present study does not find statistical
support for the hypothesis in this interval, but it does provide evidence that the
chances of surviving the first half year of
life are probably better for infants receiving some mother’s milk than for
those who receive none.

Note that in the models for the last
three analysis intervals, it is possible to
distinguish between various breastfeeding duration criteria. In each of
these analyses, mortality is far higher
among infants never breast-fed than
among those breast-fed for the longest
duration. It is of great interest that those
breast-fed for intermediate durations
have intermediate effects estimates.
This implies that the effect of breastfeeding persists after breast-feeding has
stopped. For example, in Table 8 we see
that at ages 7-12 months those weaned
at 4 to 6 months enjoy lower mortality
than those weaned at 1 to 3 months.

In the Rand study, the regression
coefficients for unsupplemented breastfeeding indicate a statistically significant
negative effect on death rates in the second through fourth intervals (i.e., after
the first week of life), while duration of
supplemented breast-feeding was significantly associated with lower mortality in
the third and fourth intervals (i.e., after
the first month of life).

In each analysis interval, the regression coefficient for unsupplemented
breast-feeding was of larger magnitude
than that for supplemented breastfeeding, implying that supplementation
was always relatively harmful. Since
both coefficients were negative in each
interval, individuals never breast-fed at
all implicitly always had higher mortality than those receiving any combination
of mother’s milk and supplementary
foods. Interestingly, although the
breast-feeding variables were statisti
Social Biology

cally significant in the fourth interval,
the effects were quite small in the second six months of life. Mortality rates
diminished by just two per thousand and
three per thousand for each month of
supplemented and unsupplemented
breast-feeding respectively. This is generally consistent with the finding from
hazards models that diet had a relatively
weak effect on mortality in a roughly
similar age category. In short, both studies provide valuable evidence for an important positive relationship between
infant survival and duration of breastfeeding, particularly in the first half-year
of life. The consistency of the two studies is especially noteworthy in view of
the many differences between the investigations.

The availability of piped water to
each infant was coded as a dummy variable in both studies. Piped water did not
significantly determine infant mortality
in any of the four intervals used in the
hazards model. Butz et. al. found that
the linear regression coefficient of piped
water was significant and positive in the
last three weeks of the first month of life
(t = 2.46), but far from significant at any
other time in the first year. The very narrow interval in which water supply was
significant may provide especially unstable estimates of the regression coefficients.

In Malaysia, ethnic group is intimately connected with nearly every socioeconomic variable, especially including typical occupation, financial
wellbeing, and type of housing (Ooi,
1976). Thus, it is not surprising that the
data show that the ethnic group of an infant has a consistently powerful effect
on its survival chances in every interval.
In each interval, the Chinese, a high status group in Malaysia, have the lowest
mortality. The highest mortality is expe
 
 

 

Vol. 34, No. 1-2

rienced in some intervals by the Indians,
who work mostly on rubber plantations,
and in other intervals by the predominantly rural, agrarian Malays. The Rand
study, too, found Chinese ethnicity to
be associated with lower risk of mortality, throughout most of the year.
Mother’s education is, like ethnic
group, a variable which is to some degree a measure of social status. We exi, pected maternal education to affect inofant survival indirectly through
‘child-rearing skills. Indeed, mothers
2 with some formal schooling seem to be
2 able to reduce the effects of some of the
A exogenous causes of mortality. The vari& able can be dropped from the first three
Glintervals, but is highly significant after
co the first six months. In the Rand study,
3 the number of years of maternal educa"e tion has no statistically significant effect
on infant mortality at any subperiod of
‘Othe first year of life. The difference in
2 the results is probably due to the differ° ence in coding.

While maternal education is expected to reduce exogenous causes of
mortality, sex differentials in death rates
are usually attributed to endogenous
causes, except where treatment of in8 fants differs markedly by sex. Such dif& ferentials should be most readily observF able early in life. In this analysis, sex was
& a highly significant predictor of mortal
ity during the first three intervals and

was omitted from the model from 7-12

months of age. Butz et al. found in their
analysis that the sex of the child was a
significant determinant of mortality at
every age, except during the second
through fourth weeks of life. In both
studies, femaie infants of every age had
higher survival rates, even at ages where
the effect was not statistically significant.

Some variables do not exhibit a con

sistent pattern of significance levels over
the age intervals in question. It would be
unwise in view of the small numbers of
deaths to judge the importance of variables solely on the basis of formal tests of
significance.

CONCLUSIONS

This study shows that breast-feeding
is an important determinant of infant
mortality in Malaysia. The protective effect of breast-feeding is statistically significant up to six months, although it
may well continue to be clinically significant at higher ages. The relationship between longer breast-feeding duration
and lower relative risk of mortality persists at every period in the first year of
life. The consumption of any food or
drink other than mother’s milk portends
a substantially increased risk of dying in
at least the first two months of life. The
protective effect of breast-feeding
seems to persist even after breastfeeding has stopped. Diet is an important predictor of mortality even though
other variables closely related both to
feeding practice and to mortality conditions are included and implicitly controlled in our models.

This is clearly a preliminary study and
a great deal of further research will be
necessary for a fuller understanding of
the effects of diet on infant mortality.
The precision of parameter estimates
for short analysis intervals could be substantially increased by studies with
Jarger samples, and it might then be possible to confirm our hypothesis of a
monotonic relationship between breastfeeding duration and lower infant mortality risk.

Butz et al. (1982) found that infant
feeding was an important determinant

of infant mortality in the MFLS sample.
The variables,, mathematical assumptions, and findings of that study and the
present work differ substantially, but an
argument can be made for the importance of breast-feeding in Malaysia on
the grounds that two quite different approaches to the same survey provide evidence for its effects. Much research on
mortality has been flawed by the use of
inherently biased breast-feeding variables which to not allow for the possibility
that infant death may sometimes precede and cause the cessation of nursing.
Both the Rand study and this one are
free from such a defect.

Further research on the effects of
breast-feeding should include a wider
array of variables, particularly dietary
variables, in the analysis of the effects of
breast-feeding. The harmful effect of receiving foods other than mother’s milk
may vary according to the types of food
received, when they are received, and
their relative proportions in the diet.
Proxy variables, such as those which
represent the quality of water supply,

Social Biology

should be carefully tested to ensure that
they accurately reflect the mortality determinants they are intended to measure. Finally, research on breast-feeding
and infant mortality should be carried
out in diverse settings to see how the effects of diet and other mortality determinants vary under differing socioeconomic and environmental conditions. In
the meantime, hazards model analysis of
the MFLS data suggests that breastfeeding for longer rather shorter durations has important health benefits in
less-developed countries, particularly
where environmental conditions are
poor. In addition, the analysis demonstrates the utility of hazards model
methodology asa powerful tool for calculating plausible relative risk estimates
when samples are relatively small and
covariates are numerous.
