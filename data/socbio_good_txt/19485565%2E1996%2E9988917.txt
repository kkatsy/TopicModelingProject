Coital Rates, Sex-selective Infanticide, and
Sex Ratios at Birth: A Reply to James

We are most grateful to Dr. James
for bringing to our attention the recent
paper by Kumm et al. (1994) relating
to the possible long-term effects of systematic sex-specific infanticide on secondary sex ratios. However, there is
no evidence that systematic infanticide
was practiced by the native populations
of either Butaritari or Guam. There
are, rather, ample historical and ethnographic materials to conclude that
infanticide was neither common nor
were sons favored over daughters in either the Mariana Islands or Butaritari.

For example, Spanish observers,
beginning at least with Fray Juan Pobre de Zamora in 1602, commented at
length on the exceptional affection and
love which Chamorros (native Mariana
Islanders) showed to their children
(Driver, 1983, p. 210). Indeed, armed
resistance to missionization in the latter part of the same century was attributed by the Spanish themselves in large
part to native anger over infant deaths,
ascribed by the Chamorros to the consequences of baptism by priests who
hastened to administer to sick babies
(Barrett, 1975, pp. 35-36).

Early historical materials from the
Gilbert Islands (Kiribati) attest explicitly to the absence of infanticide.
Based largely on interviews with longresident Europeans John Kirby and
Robert Wood, the Wilkes expedition
reported (Wilkes, 1845, V, p. 103) that

ee
e

. . children are never destroyed after birth.”” Although a detailed recitation beyond these earliest reports is not
appropriate here, examination of a sizable body of historical materials reveals that subsequent observers failed
to find evidence that systematic infanticide was or had been practiced on either Butaritari or Guam. Further, the
nature of ambilineal descent with female inheritance and land holding
being common in Butaritari and the
influential role of women which so
amazed early Spanish visitors to the
(matrilineal) Mariana Islands indicate
that sex-selective infanticide would
have been highly inconsistent with prevailing native ideologies.

We can only conclude that any examination of the possible skewing effects of systematic sex-selective infanticide on sex ratios must be undertaken
in other human populations than these.

Finally, it appears necessary to emphasize our earlier statement (Brewis
and Underwood, 1994, p. 280) disavowing the use of secondary sex ratio
(SSR) as a priori evidence of high coital rates with age or marital duration.
We have not and do not claim that
SSR variation across societies is wholly
explained by coital rates; rather we describe SSR’s as a demographic corollary of characteristically high population rates of coitus in two Micronesian
Island populations.
