Sex Differences in Human Spatial Ability: Not
an X-linked Recessive Gene Effect

ABSTRACT: Spatial visualization scores were obtained on the members of two hundred families.
Large sex differences favoring males were found in both parents and offspring. Familial correlations, however, did not order themselves as predicted from the theory that human spatial
visualization is under the control of an X-linked recessive gene. The results are compatible with a
sex limitation and/or socialization theory of ability acquisition.

Human spatial ability has long been of
interest to psychologists. Male superiority
on tasks requiring spatial ability is among
the most persistent of individual differences in all of the abilities literature (Maccoby and Jacklin, 1974). Spatial ability is
known to be influenced almost as much by
genetic factors as is verbal ability in all
populations studied (Bock and Vandenberg, 1968; Vandenberg, 1967; DeFries et
jal., 1976; Park et al., in press) and is much
less correlated with traditional measures
of environmental quality such as social
status and level of education than is verbal
ability (Marjoribanks, 1972). Spatial ability is also more highly correlated with success in a number of technical, vocational,
and occupational domains than is verbal
ability or intelligence (Bennett, et al.,
1974; Ghiselli, 1973; Smith, 1964), making
it an important variable in applied psychology. Recent work in hemispheric
specialization suggests: (a) that the right
hemisphere is specialized for spatial processing and (b) that boys have greater
hemisphere specialization than girls
(Nebes, 1974).

A small body of studies has suggested
that spatial ability may be enhanced by an

X-linked recessive gene, and this hypothesis has served as a tentative explanation
of some of the above effects. Stafford
(1961), Hartlage (1970) and Bock and
Kolakowski (1973) have reported patterns
of parent-offspring correlations suggestive
of such an effect. Under random mating
and a recessive gene frequency of g = 0.5
(the frequency that best explains the mean
sex difference and the shape of the male
and female distributions), the expected
order of familial correlations is as follows:

Y sis-Sis - *Mo-Son = 1Fa-Dau > 1 Bro-Bro
> T Mo-Dau > Y Bro-Sis > Y Fa-Son
Yen (1975) has reported sibling correlations that also support the X-linkage recessive gene hypothesis. Recently DeFries
et al. (1976) and Park et al. (in press) have
reported parent offspring correlations on
three large samples that do not support the
X-linkage hypothesis. Williams (1975) has
reported father-son and mother-son correlations of 0.28 and 0.05 in a block-designs
test, findings which are also incompatible
with the theory. No study until now has
reported al) familial correlations gathered
with a single test on a single sample. We
report such a study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Our sample consisted of 200 families
with 801 individuals nearly evenly distributed between males (V = 396) and
females (N = 405). Subjects were University of Minnesota undergraduate students and their family members. Incentive
for student participation included experience in test administration and four experimental points which were added to
their final course grade. This is the typical
recruitment procedure at Minnesota. The
students were administered the Mental
Rotation Test (Vandenberg, 1975) and the
Hidden Patterns Test. Only data on the
Mental Rotation Test are reported in this
paper. Each student was then trained to
administer the two tests, given a set of
written instructions, a demographic questionnaire, and asked to administer both
tests and the questionnaire to all members
of his or her family between the ages of 11
and 69. Only data on full sibs and biologically related parents and offspring, as determined from parental reports, are reported in this paper. One week was allowed for the return of the data. Ninetysix per cent of the students returned usable
data.

are given in Table 1. On the Mental Rotation Test there was a significant sex difference (p < 0.001) within each generation.
Generational differences were also significant (p < 0.001) for each sex. There
were no significant differences among the
four groups in mean number of Mental
Rotation Test items completed. Examination of male and female score distributions
showed that only 20 per cent of all females
scored above the male median. Our data
therefore demonstrate the typical sex difference that the X-linked recessive gene
theory purports to explain. Spatial ability
shows a marked age and/or cohort effect
as indicated in Table 1. Following DeFries
et al. (1976) and Park et al. (in press) we
used a Z-score banding technique to remove the effects of age. Raw test scores
were grouped into five-year intervals by
sex and expressed as Z-scores. Our correlations are intraclass correlations based on
these Z-scores.

The age-corrected intrafamilial correlations of spatial test scores from six previous studies and the current study are
shown in Table 2. The weighted average
of the first three studies of parent-offspring
and Yen’s sib study support the X-linked
theory as previously indicated. The results
of the three new parent-offspring studies
all fail to conform to the expected pattern.
None of our parent-offspring correlations
differ significantly from each other, and

therefore do not conform to the expected
pattern. The difference between the
brother-brother correlation and_ the
sister-sister correlation is highly significant
(¢ < 0.005) in the direction opposite that
predicted by the theory.

Our results taken in conjunction with
those of DeFries et al. (1976) and Park et
al. (in press) refute the X-linkage recessive
gene hypothesis and suggest that the
search for the cause of mean differences in
spatial ability for the two sexes be directed
elsewhere. An alternative to the X-linked
hypothesis is that—analogous to height—
sex limitation occurs. Sex limitation will
produce sexual dimorphism in the quantitative distribution of a polygenically controlled trait. Petersen (1976) has demonstrated that androgenicity is related to
spatial ability, and Waber (1976) found

spatial ability related to maturation rate.
On the environmental side, our sib correlations are compatible with a theory which
argues that boys in a family tend to be
pushed into activities that foster spatial
ability (sports and mechanical activities)
while girls are not as consistently channeled into such activities (Sherman, 1967).
