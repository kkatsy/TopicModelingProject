Comment on “Sudden Infant Death Syndrome
as a Socially Determined Cause of Death’’

Catherine V. Fleshman

Health Programs Management
Green Valley, Arizona

For the past fifteen years, analyses of
infant mortality in the United States
have shown that poor Blacks and poor
Native Americans experience a rate of
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome two to
three times that of whites (Centers for
Disease Control, 1986; National SIDS
Foundation, 1985; Shannon and Kelly,
1982; Vanlandingham et al., 1988). In
an effort to understand more of the risk
factors associated with SIDS, a number
of investigative studies are ongoing
around the country in which rigorous review of social, behavioral, and medical
history is carried out. For the past two
years I have been working on one of
these, and it focuses on American Indians and Alaska Natives in ten states,
over a three-year period.

I am responding to Nam, Eberstein,
and Deeb’s article, ‘‘Sudden Infant
Death Syndrome as a Socially Determined Cause of Death,” in Social Biology 36:1—8, 1989. The authors present
the use of the term ‘‘STDS” (which is established by history and autopsy after
excluding all other potential causes) as a
causal dichotomy “of two alternative
models”’ (p. 1), that of medical/
biological versus that of social/cultural.
I feel that it is more enlightening to view
risk factors in terms of the interaction
between biological and societal factors.

I have compiled a short bibliography at
the end of this comment in which the researchers have done this, that is, they
have discussed maternal economics,
education, health behavior, tobacco and
chemical use, and social milieu in addition to those variables found on birth
and death certificates and medical re
‘cords.

Investigations into the medical determinants of SIDS have yielded many bits
of information but no unifying hypotheses or effective interventions. The advent of electromechanical monitoring
for “near-miss” cases has not reduced
the SIDS rate (National SIDS Foundation, 1985). The authors attempt to pursue the possibility of socially determined
contributions to this cause of infant mortality. They have added to the quantification of the association of SIDS with
certain social and behavioral factors,
but do not have the evidence to sustain
their assertion of causality.

The instruments used to provide information for their analysis were the
birth and death certificates. These are
legal instruments of the state and to date
do not provide for the entry of the social
and environmental circumstances of the
death. Furthermore, these circumstances are not necessarily known or investigated by coroner or medical exam

iner personnel. In addition, it could be
that Nam et al. are not thoroughly familiar with the protocols established for filling out the death certificate queries.
SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and
therefore one would not expect to find
additional biological problems listed.
The ‘“‘absence of other conditions” (p. 3)
is in fact expected.

The authors have clearly shown the
association of SIDS with certain social
and demographic indicators. However,
their conclusion of social deprivation
and relative neglect can not be drawn
from their data, nor can the conclusion
that the infants with prior intensive hospital care did not receive appropriate infant care after discharge. While these assertions may be true, “‘the picture. . . of
mildly sick infants who do not receive
sufficient attention at times when such
attention is most needed” (p. 7) should
be presented as an hypothesis to be
properly investigated, not as a conclusion.

Until such time as a complete review
of all infant deaths occurs with regularity, we will have to be content with the

information on the death certificate.
This is not as bleak, in the case of SIDS,
as the authors might lead us to believe.
If the conditions set down by Beckwith
are met (i.e., the history and autopsy
criteria), then SIDS can not be used
‘“‘when diagnosis is uncertain or in order
to mercifully conclude a medical investigation.” If neglect of an illness leads to
death, this would not be SIDS and
would be revealed by history or autopsy.
If neglect of food or abuse were present,
these too would be found at autopsy.

The important points of this paper
are that social and demographic factors
are powertully associated with this significant remaining cause of excess infant
mortality in the United States. Showing
causality and establishing the mechanism by which these factors work can
not be done through the currently existing vital record instruments. A comprehensive community-oriented team review and investigation of each infant
death (or at least of suspected SIDS)
should be performed in order to get beyond only biological factors.
