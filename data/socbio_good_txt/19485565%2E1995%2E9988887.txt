ABSTRACT: Using data from the 1988 Two-Per-Thousand Survey of Fertility and Birth Control,
this paper examines the effects of gender, birth order, and other correlates of childhood mortality
in China. Controlling for family-level factors, childhood mortality is found to be associated with
the child’s gender and birth order. Among firstborn children the difference between male and
female childhood mortality is not statistically significant, but among others, female children
between ages 1 and 5 experience higher mortality than male children. Childhood mortality is
slightly higher for children who have older brothers only than for those who have older sisters
only, and it is highest for those who have both older brothers and sisters. Other factors affecting
childhood mortality in China include mortality of older siblings, birth interval, urban/rural
residence, mother’s level of education, and mother’s occupation. All interactive effects between
gender and family-level characteristics are found to be statistically insignificant.

China has experienced rapid mortality decline during the past four decades. Official statistics show that measures of mortality, such as crude death
rate, infant mortality rate, and life expectancy, have all changed by more
than 50 per cent in the 35 years from
1950-54 to 1985-89. Life expectancy
gained by 70 per cent, reflecting an exceptionally rapid mortality decline by
international standards. In comparison, Latin America experienced a 29
per cent increase in life expectancy,
and Asia as a whole experienced a 49
per cent increase during the same period. Demographers identify the main
causes of the rapid mortality decline
in China as improved nutrition resulting from a more egalitarian distribution of wealth and the government’s
ambitious rural health care programs
emphasizing preventive care (Banister, 1987; Banister and Preston, 1981;
Coale, 1984; Hao, 1994).

While there has been an impressive
reduction in mortality, not everyone
seems to have enjoyed the benefits
equally. Certain segments of the population have been, and still are, subject
to higher risks of mortality than others.
Estimates of female life expectancy in
1981 varied by local area, from 73.6
years in Beijing Municipality to 61.9
years in Xinjiang Province. Substantial
differences were also observed among
types of location: from a female life expectancy of 72.7 years in cities and 73.4
years in towns, to 68.6 years in rural
counties. These differentials are found
to be associated with differences in
medical facilities, availability of professionally trained health workers, and
levels of development (Hao, 1994; Poston, 1989). Besides the regional differences, one of the most noteworthy
characteristics of differential mortality
in China is its unusual age-sex pattern,
characterized by higher female than

® male mortality during early childhood
oo (Hao and Wang, 1992).

© In most populations with moderate
= to low mortality, male mortality is
‘~ higher than female mortality at all
— ages. According to the Coale and De=,meny model life tables, which repre= sent actual experiences of mortality in
S a variety of populations, the male-to‘S female ratio of age-specific conditional
probabilities of dying between ages 1
= and 5 (4q; values in life tables) ranges
‘= from 1.1 to 1.4. The ratio is higher in
~ populations with lower levels of mortality. A similar pattern has been observed in Japan. During the period
"3 1950-69, when the level of female
‘ childhood mortality (conditional prob2 ability of dying between exact ages 1
9 and 5) declined from 35.46 to 3.79 per
1,000 infants, the average male-tofemale ratio of childhood mortality was
1.15 (Nanjo and Kobayashi, 1985).
This ratio gradually increased with
time.

Excess female mortality during
childhood has been found elsewhere,
especially in populations characterized
by strong son preference such as those
in South Asia (Chen et al., 1981; Das
Gupta, 1987; Koenig and D’Souza,

Schultz, 1982) and East Asia (Choe,
1987; Hao and Wang, 1992; Park,
1955; Ware, 1981). In this paper, we
examine the patterns and covariates of
childhood mortality in China in order
to identify the extent of gender differentials and related factors. By doing
so, we seek to achieve a better understanding of the links between son preference, family building, and childhood
mortality.

Excess female mortality, when it is
observed, is most evident between ages
1 and 5 when a child’s health and mortality are most strongly linked to parental care (Hobcraft et al., 1985;
Muhuri and Preston, 1991; Waldron,
1987). This is not surprising when we
examine the leading causes of death at
different ages in childhood. During infancy, most causes of deaths are related to genetic and prenatal conditions, but the leading causes of death
between ages 1 and 5 are known to
be respiratory infections, other infectious and parasitic diseases, diarrheal
diseases, and accidents (Table 2).
Whether young children die from these
causes depends, to a large extent, on

52 Choe et al.

the quality of care provided to them by
adults. Higher female childhood mortality, which represents a departure
from the usual pattern, suggests the
unequal treatment of male and female
children within a family in such areas as
immunizations, quality of care during
illness, exposure to risks, and allocation of resources including food. Studies on childhood mortality in India
and Bangladesh have identified some
gender-biased parental behaviors that
may lead to excess female childhood
mortality. Among these are feeding
practices (Amin and Pebley, 1991;
Caldwell, Reddy, and Caldwell, 1983;
Chen, Huq, and D’Souza, 1981) and
the use of health care facilities (Amin
and Pebley, 1991; Basu, 1989; Das
Gupta, 1987).

The traditional family system in
China is based on patrilineal and patriarchal principle, which has developed a culture favoring sons over
daughters. In modern China, the Communist revolution and industrialization have brought changes in the
government-protected rights of individuals and in social and economic conditions. Nevertheless, evidence of son
preference has frequently been documented in behavior related to family
formation. Analyses of large-scale survey data have shown that behaviors of
married couples—such as contraceptive use, fertility, and use of induced
abortions—vary according to whether
or not they already have sons (Arnold
and Liu, 1986; Choe et al., 1992) and
whether a fetus is male or female
(Zeng et al., 1993; Coale and Banister,
1994). It is conceivable that son preference, which results in differential fertility behavior, may also affect parental
behavior in caring for young children,

 

 

Social Biology

which in turn results in differential
mortality.

While we hypothesize that female
children experience more exposure to
mortality risks than male children as a
result of parent’s discriminatory behavior, we also hypothesize that the
discrimination against female children
is not uniform across socioeconomic
groups within the population. At the
family level, those who are more educated or are engaged in daily activities
in more modernized sectors of society
may have more egalitarian attitudes toward gender roles and may be less
likely to discriminate against female
children.

At the intrafamily level, discrimination against female children may depend on birth order and the gender

composition of other children. A cross
national study on the value of children
and son preference documents that
parents in societies where sons are
strongly preferred wish to have daughters as well, but fewer in number than
sons (Arnold and Kuo, 1984). Parents
are also found to have preferences related to order of sons and daughters.
Older daughters are preferred because
they often perform housework and
provide care for younger siblings. In
many East Asian countries, older female children are also found to contribute to family finances, especially by
working to help pay for the education
of younger male siblings (Greenhalgh,
1985; Mintz, 1977; Lebra, 1984).
Thus, excess female mortality, originating from parents’ discrimination
against less desirable children, would
depend on birth order and the gender
of siblings. Recent studies document
that this is often the case. Gender effects on childhood mortality are found

Sto be more pronounced among highorder births in India (Das Gupta,

1987). Our analysis examines the gen« der effects on childhood mortality and

MATERIALS AND METHODS

We use the data from China’s 1988
© Two-Per-Thousand Survey of Fertility
and Birth Control. The survey, carried
out by China’s State Family Planning
Commission, collected birth histories
from nearly half a million ever-married
women aged 15-57, constituting a nationally representative sample excluding Taiwan and Hong Kong (Lavely,
1991). Information is provided on the
date of birth and survival status of each
child these women have borne, as well
as on the date of death of any child who

ownloaded

died before the survey. The survey also
collected information on the socioeconomic characteristics of the women
and their husbands such as ethnicity,
residence type, education, and occupation as well as some characteristics of
the family.

From a 10 per cent sample of the
survey data available to us, we analyze
records of 89,086 children born during
1965-87 who survived the first year of
life. We limit the analysis to births during 1965-87 for two reasons. First, because the survey collected birth histories of women aged 15-57 in 1988, the
births available for analysis as we go
back in time are limited to women of
progressively younger ages. For example, the births in 1978 are limited to
women aged 47 and younger, and
births in 1965 are limited to women
aged 34 and younger. Second, the Chinese population experienced a series of
unusually severe famines and political
upheavals during the 1958-60 period,

which caused a short-term but drastic
increase in mortality. By limiting our
analysis to births after 1965, we avoid
most of the effects of this unusual mortality change, focusing rather on the
usual pattern of differential mortality.

We also limit our examination to
childhood mortality occurring between
ages 1 and 5 because our study focuses
on the gender differentials of childhood mortality associated with parental discrimination. As discussed earlier, before age one, the most frequent
causes of deaths are associated with genetic conditions: the quality of parental
care does not have a large impact. Further, Chinese data based on retrospective reports of births and deaths, which
are otherwise of exceptionally high
quality, are known to suffer from a
substantial degree of underreporting of
very early infant deaths, especially for
females (Coale and Banister, 1994;
Smith, 1994; Zeng et al., 1993). The

reporting of deaths after infancy is
found to be relatively complete.

We first compute levels of childhood
mortality for four groups, based on
gender and birth order. This is done by
the life-table method using monthly
probabilities of dying. We then examine the effects of gender and other
covariates on childhood mortality by
fitting proportional hazard models separately for firstborn and later-born
children. We fit the hazard models to
mortality between ages 1 and 5, estimating the average effects of the covariates.

Table 3 shows the list of variables we
examine as covariates of childhood
mortality together with simple descriptive statistics. Some variables are computed from pregnancy histories: birth
interval, maternal age, number and
gender composition of surviving siblings at the time of each birth, and
childhood deaths of older siblings.

RESULTS

Figures la through 1d show the
monthly probability of dying at ages
6-59 months for the four groups of
children classified by gender and birth
order (firstborn and others). They reveal a small amount of heaping in the
reported ages at death, at 12, 24, 36,
and 48 months. The heaping at age 12
months results in a slight underestimate of infant mortality and a slight
overestimate of childhood mortality,
because infant deaths at just under age
one would be reported as deaths at age
one. The age heaping, however, is not
likely to affect the estimates of gender
differentials because there is no evidence that the misreporting of age at
death is related to a child’s gender.

months: China, births in 1965-1988.

Table 4 shows the results of the lifetable analysis. For children classified
by gender and birth order, the conditional probabilities of dying before age
1 (infant mortality) and between ages 1
and 5 (childhood mortality) were computed based on monthly probabilities
of dying. The table also shows corresponding figures for Japan for the period 1953-60 and model life tables by
Coale and Demeny (1983) for comparison. Both infant and childhood mortality are lower among firstborn children than among other children. Part
of this difference is attributable to spurious associations. Women’s characteristics associated with higher fertility are
also associated with higher mortality of
their children. For example, women
with no formal education are more

likely to have children of high birth orders than women with some formal education, and at the same time, children
from mothers with no education are
likely to experience higher mortality
than children from mothers with some
formal education. In addition, because
the level of fertility has been falling
rapidly in recent years, children of
higher birth orders are more likely to
have been born at an earlier time,
when the general level of mortality was
much higher (Hao and Wang, 1992).
The sex ratio of mortality varies by
birth order and age of children. Infant
mortality is 23 per cent higher for
males than for females among firstborn
children, but the difference is very
small for higher-order births. However, the possibility of underreporting

differentia] childhood mortality. These
findings are consistent with results
from other studies on childhood mortality in China (Tu, 1989) and elsewhere (e.g., Hobcraft et al., 1984).
Also consistent with findings elsewhere, children born to families that
have already experienced childhood
mortality are much more likely to die
during childhood than are children
born to other families. Children born
after a short birth interval also experience much higher mortality (e.g., Hobcraft et al., 1985) than other children.

The child’s gender is not a statistically significant covariate of childhood
mortality among firstborn children. It
is statistically significant at the 10 per
cent level, however, among higherorder births. A more meaningful test

of significance, however, would be
whether the observed gender difference in childhood mortality departs
from the usual male-to-female ratio,
which ranges between 1.1 and 1.4. The
estimated relative risk of childhood
mortality in China differs significantly
at the 5 per cent level from the lower
limit of commonly observed values
for later-born children, but not for
firstborn children. In other words, the
excess female childhood mortality observed in China is statistically significant at the 5 per cent level for children
of birth order two or higher but not
for firstborn children. Table 5 also
shows that none of the interaction
terms between gender of the child and
socioeconomic covariates is statistically significant, implying that parental

DISCUSSION

Although the survival probabilities
of young children in China have improved greatly in recent years, differential mortality continues to exist
among various socioeconomic groups.
As in other populations, children born
to families that have already experienced childhood mortality and children born after a short birth interval
are more likely than other children to
die in early childhood. Children born
to mothers who are urban residents,
have some formal education, or are engaged in nonfarm activities experience
lower levels of mortality.

In addition, in some cases childhood
mortality depends on the child’s gender. The effect of gender depends on
birth order and the gender composition
of older siblings. Among firstborn children, gender differences in childhood
mortality are not significant. Among

later-born children, females experience higher levels of mortality than
males. On the assumption that differential childhood mortality is largely
due to differential parental care, our
findings suggest that female children
with older siblings receive less favorable care than their male counterparts.
Chinese parents seem to value a firstborn female child nearly as much as a
male. This finding is consistent with results from other studies on the status of
female children in East Asia. Such
studies have found that firstborn female children are likely to contribute

to family welfare, not only by performing household duties and child care,
but also by contributing to household income by employment. Parents
are thus willing to invest in the eldest female child (see, for example,
Greenhalgh, 1985). Another possible
explanation for the lack of gender differential in childhood mortality among
firstborn children is the simultaneous
effect of parent’s attitudes on both fertility and childhood mortality. Parents
with egalitarian attitudes toward sons
and daughters are more likely than
others to have only one child.

= Among children who have older sib- crimination against female children

yg lings, the level of childhood mortality
'g also depends on whether they have sis= ters or brothers. In general, childhood
= mortality is highest in families with
A both older brothers and sisters and
lowest in families with older sisters
only. Among families with older sisters
only, female children are at a much
higher risk of childhood mortality than
are male children. This gender differential is smallest for children who are
born to families with male children
only. In other words, among female
children in families with more than one
child, girls who have only brothers experience the least discrimination: dis
seems to start with second daughters.

What makes female children in
China experience higher levels of
mortality than male children? As we
have seen earlier, the leading causes of
death between ages 1 and 5 are preventable to a certain extent and depend on the quality of parental care.
Although we do not have direct information on the quality of child care,
there are some indirect indicators.
One documented indicator is mothers’
breastfeeding behavior. In China the
length of exclusive breastfeeding does
not differ much between male and female children, but the median length

62 . Choe et al.

of breastfeeding with supplemental
food is about two months longer for
males (Tu, 1990; Wang, 1991). Although the direct effect of breastfeeding on child survival is not strong after
the first year of life (Tu, 1989), we consider breastfeeding to be an indicator
of parents’ affection and care, especially after the introduction of supplemental food.

Another measurable behavior is the
probability of having additional births.
The probability of having another
birth, and of having one after a short
interval, is much higher in China after
the birth of a female (see Choe et al.,
1992, for example). A short subsequent birth interval is known to be
strongly associated with high childhood mortality in China and elsewhere
(Retherford et al., 1989; Tu, 1989). Female children may receive less parental
care and allocation of resources than
male children because they are more
likely to have a younger sibling at a
very early age. We do not have information on other possible behaviors
such as feeding, immunization, and
child care arrangements.

Our analysis shows that discrimination against females is not evident for
firstborn children. This finding may
partly be because parents who do not
discriminate against children according
to their gender may also be more likely
to have just one child.

Parental behavior in China seems to
be influenced strongly by a desire to
have at least one son combined with a
preference for a small family. In this

2The desire for a small family size, however, results from a strong government program as much as
from personal preference.

sense, excess female childhood mortality can be viewed as a part of a strategy
to build ideal families that are small in
size but include sons. Other behaviors
related to this strategy include sexselective induced abortions, resulting
in high sex ratios at birth, and female
infanticides (Coale and Banister, 1994;
Zeng et al., 1993).

Our analysis also found that among
those parents who have more than one
child the discrimination against female
children is more or less uniform across
families with different socioeconomic
characteristics. This finding suggests
that developmental changes that improve the socioeconomic status of families in China will not necessarily improve the status of female children.
Eliminating gender-based discriminatory attitudes among parents will depend on fundamental changes in the
norms that prevail throughout Chinese
society.
