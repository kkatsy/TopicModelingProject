Voluntary and Involuntary Childlessness
Among Catholic and Non-Catholic Women:

Are the Patterns Converging?

ABSTRACT: Data from 1976 and 1982 show Catholics less likely than non-Catholics to be voluntarily childless and more likely to be involuntarily childless. Declining differences in fertility

and contraception are discussed.

There is an abundant literature on
the effects of Catholic religious affiliation on fertility behavior. However,
with the exception of Poston and Kramer’s (1986) analysis of data from the
mid-1970’s, there has been little attention directed specifically to the effects of
religious affiliation on the incidence and
type of childlessness.

Given the long-standing emphasis of
the Roman Catholic Church on the importance of children in marriage and on
the family, Catholics, on average,
should be less inclined than nonCatholics to decide voluntarily to have
no children. Further, for reasons discussed below, Catholics should be more
likely than non-Catholics to be involuntarily childless.

Most research on the fertility and
contraception behavior of Catholics and
non-Catholics conducted prior to the
late 1970’s reported that Catholics and
non-Catholics had decidedly different
patterns (Stouffer, 1935; Robinson,
1936; Freedman et al. 1959; Zimmer
and Goldscheider, 1966; Westoff and
Ryder, 1977; among others). However,
recent studies have shown that overall
Catholic fertility now tends to converge
with non-Catholic fertility (Jones and

Westoff, 1979), or, at least, that the differences between the two groups have
declined (Mosher and Hendershot,
1984a,b). The question we raise in this
paper is whether the results of these
more current fertility and contraception
studies extend to voluntary and involuntary childlessness.

In some ways, the voluntary decision
to have no children is not the same as the
decision to have few children. Indeed,
some have noted that while it may be acceptable in the United States to have
only two children (or even one child),
there still are some pressures against
having no children (Griffith, 1973;
Veevers, 1973a,b, 1980; Burgwyn,
1981; Poston and Kramer, 1981; Faux,
1984). These normative constraints notwithstanding, census data indicate that
childlessness among ever-married white
women 25 to 29 years old in the United
States has increased from about 12 per
cent in 1965 to more than 28 per cent in
1986 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1977
and 1987). And Bloom and Pebley
(1982) have projected that for younger
cohorts of American women, namely
those born in the mid-1950’s and later,
as many as 30 per cent will never have a
child.

Recent social science research findings do report that the emphasis on procreation is still strong among Catholics
(Fee et al., 1981) And, as we show below, this emphasis continues to be very
much a part of Catholic doctrine. Therefore, it would not surprise us to find that
even though in recent years, Catholic—
non-Catholic differences in fertility and
contraception have tended to converge,
Catholic-non-Catholic differences in
voluntary and involuntary childlessness
have not. We examine these expectations about the relationship between
Catholic affiliation and the incidence
and type of childlessness with data from
the 1976 and 1982 National Surveys of
Family Growth.

PRIOR STUDIES AND
RATIONALE

Religious affiliation 1s one of the most
frequently investigated variables in
studies of fertility differentials. The theoretical and empirical importance of religious preference has been discussed repeatedly (c.f., Westoff et al., 1963,
1964; Andorka, 1978; Coward. 1980;
Chamie, 1981; Williams and Zimmer,
1990), and there is a vast literature on
the topic. In this section we mention
some of the recent studies dealing with
Catholic—non-Catholic fertility and contraception differentials. We also discuss
the few studies that have examined religion and childlessness.

In many studies of fertility in Western
industrialized nations, religious differences have often been synonymous with
Catholic-Protestant differences (Day,
1964, 1968; Higgins, 1964; Burch, 1966;
Whelpton et al., 1966; Glass, 1968; Ryder and Westoff, 1971; Coward, 1980;
Compton et al., 1985; among others).
And this theme is especially prevalent in

Social Biology

studies of U.S. fertility since the 1950's
(Westoff et al., 1963; Whelpton et al.,
1966; Ryder and Westoff, 1971).

However, the 1970 National Fertility
Survey showed a decline in CatholicProtestant differences in fertility (Westoff and Ryder, 1977), along with a convergence in Catholic and non-Catholic
contraceptive practices (Westoff and
Bumpass, 1973; Westoff and Jones,
1977). Indeed, by the late 1970’s some
demographers reported that Catholic—
non-Catholic fertility differentials had
disappeared for all practical purposes
(Jones and Westoff, 1979). Others,
however, noted that while it is true that
the differences between Catholic and
non-Catholic patterns of fertility and
contraception have narrowed over the
years, significant differences still exist
(Mosher and Hendershot, 1984a,b;
Mosher and Goldscheider, 1984; Goldscheider and Mosher, 1988; Williams and
Zimmer, 1990).

Only a few studies have documented
differences in the religious preferences
of the voluntarily childless. Gustavus
and Henley (1971) investigated the
characteristics of childless couples who
were voluntarily sterilized and found
that Catholics were relatively underrepresented. Poston (1976) examined the
religious preferences of voluntarily and
involuntarily childless wives in a study of
the characteristics of women in the 1965
National Fertility Survey. Although
Catholic women were represented
among the voluntarily childless in about
the same proportion as Baptists and
Methodists, he found greater proportions of both involuntarily and temporarily childless women among Catholics
than among women with other religious
preferences. Poston and Kramer (1986)
studied childlessness patterns of white
Catholic and non-Catholic women with

data from the 1976 National Survey of
Family Growth. They found that Catholic women between the ages of 34 and 45
were much less likely than non-Catholic
women to be voluntarily childless, but
much more likely to be involuntarily
childless.

Why we ask, have scholars found differences in levels of voluntary and involuntary childlessness between Catholic
and non-Catholic women? There are
theological and normative reasons with
regard to voluntary childlessness, and
structural reasons with respect to involuntary childlessness.

In the first half of this century, and for
previous centuries, Catholic teaching
discouraged voluntary childlessness.
Catholics raised in the United States before the Second Vatican Council, say,
before 1962, were taught their religion
by reading, reciting, and memorizing
The Baltimore Catechism. The Catechism proclaimed that the primary purpose of marriage was the procreation
and rearing of children; the secondary
purpose was the mutual satisfaction and
support of the husband and wife, along
with the satisfaction of their sexual desires. Voluntary childlessness was, at
best, frowned upon by the Catholic
Church, if not discouraged.

The Second Vatican Council, in its
Pastoral Constitution on The Church in
the Modern World (Abbott, 1966), recast the purpose of marriage away from
one involving primary and secondary
aims. The Council Fathers noted that
marriage is intended for the procreation
and education of children, who are the
“supreme gift of marriage’ (Abbott,
1966, p. 254). But they also observed
that some “other purposes of matrimony are not of less account. . . . [Indeed marriage is a] communion of life,
and maintains value and indissolubility,

Catholic and Non-Catholic Childlessness 253

even when offspring are lacking” (Ab- _
bott, 1966, p. 255). Keefe (1980) has
written that this Vatican II pastoral returned to a more biblically based theme
of marriage, one in which marriage 1s
seen aS a covenant, I.e., a commitment
between husband and wife based on
trust and love. The Council Fathers reiterated the fact that marriage is intended
to serve God’s command to increase and
multiply, but this should not be seen as
exhausting all of marriage’s essential
qualities.

Since the end of Vatican II, marriage
has thus been defined by the Church as
having two goals, each of them coequal: begetting and raising children;
and mutual satisfaction and support between spouses. However, this dramatic
shift in the definition of marriage has not
placed the objective of begetting and
rearing children into a less prominent
position. This purpose is still a major objective of marriage.

For instance, in all of the Catholic dioceses of Texas, Catholics wishing to be
married in the Church are required to
meet with a priest or deacon in a premarriage conference, usually involving
at least three separate sessions. During
or prior to the first meeting, the groom
and bride are both required to answer
six questions under oath, separately,
and not in each other’s presence. The
fourth question is: “God willing, do
both of you intend to have children in
this marriage?” If both parties respond
that they do not plan to have children, it
is not likely that they would be permitted to be married in the Church. And
most other dioceses in the United States
are characterized by similar practices
and strictures.

It thus appears that the Catholic
Church to this day does not maintain a
neutral position on voluntary childlessDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

254 Poston

ness. Although it does not excommunicate acouple who decides after marriage
to refrain from having children, its
stance on a couple’s pre-marriage decision to be voluntarily childless is very restrictive. Accordingly, we expect Catholic women to be much less inclined than
non-Catholic women to be voluntarily
childless. And we do not expect to find
much convergence in these Catholic—
non-Catholic patterns of voluntary
childlessness during 1976 to 1982.

Turning next to involuntary childlessness, we find that there are a number of
reasons why Catholic women should be
more disposed than non-Catholic
women to be involuntarily childless. Although on the surface, these reasons are
mainly structural and behavioral, there
is also some basis for them in Catholic
theology, regulations, and normative
expectations.

In the first place, Catholic women
typically marry later than Protestant
women because, among other reasons,
the Church requires a series of visits between the couple and a priest or deacon
for a period of from three to six months
before the marriage. Wilson and Myers
(1984) have shown that Catholic women
with first marriages in 1960 and earlier
were more than one year older at marriage than their Protestant counterparts;
and these differences were maintained
even after controlling for variables such
as educational attainment, church attendance, and religious commitment.
Since Catholic women, on average, are
older at first marriage than Protestants,
they have fewer years available to attempt to fulfill their desired fertility.
Moreover, the fewer the number of
years that women spend “at risk” of
having children, the less their chances of
having them. Accordingly, since Catholic women on the average have fewer

Social Biology

years ‘‘at risk’’ than non-Catholic
women, their levels of involuntary childlessness should be higher.

The second reason is that Catholic
women tend to be older at the birth of
their first child compared to nonCatholic women. This differential persists even after controlling for educational attainment and the timing of the
birth and the first marriage (Wilson and
Myers, 1984). This differential should
result in more involuntary childlessness
for Catholic women for the same reason
as that just discussed for the later marriage patterns of Catholics. The longer
the delay between marriage and first
birth, the greater the likelihood of being
involuntarily childless.

A third reason is that Catholic
women have a lower divorce rate than
non-Catholic women. Among women
with first marriages in 1960 or earlier, 18
per cent of the Protestants had a divorce
versus 10 per cent of the Catholics
(Wilson and Myers, 1984). Data from
the 1983 General Social Survey permit a
different kind of comparison, with the
same conclusion: Among ever-married
women aged 20~—29, 34 per cent of the
non-Catholic women had a divorce,
compared to 23 per cent of the Catholic
women (Davis, 1983). For some women
(and men), divorce may be visualized as
a “way out” of involuntary childlessness. It is possible that women who were
involuntarily childless in one marriage
(the childlessness due to either the husband or the wife) may be able to bear
children in the next marriage. Because
Catholics do not divorce as frequently as
non-Catholics, Catholic women should
have higher levels of involuntary childlessness.

Finally, there is also the possibility
that some of the Catholic women who —
report themselves as involuntarily childDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

Vol. 37, No. 3-4

less may actually be voluntarily childless. But owing to the pronatalist norms
of the Catholic Church, among other
things, these women may have rationalized their voluntary childlessness as involuntary. We believe, however, that
their defining themselves as involuntarily childless warrants our classifying
them as involuntary childless. For as
W. I. Thomas observed many years ago
(quoted in Merton, 1957, p. 421), if persons “define situations as real, they are
real in their consequences.”

For the above reasons, we expect
that levels of involuntary childlessness
for Catholic women should be higher
than those for non-Catholic women.
Moreover, since there have been few if
any changes in the above behaviors over
the past decade, we do not expect to see
a Significant amount of convergence in
these patterns of involuntary childlessness for the period covered by our study.
We turn now to the data and methods of
our investigation, and then to the
results.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In order to assess the degree to which
Catholic and non-Catholic women differ
in the incidence and type of childlessness, and the extent to which these differences have changed, we will analyze
data from the 1976 and 1982 National
Surveys of Family Growth. These nationally representative surveys consisted in 1976 of 8,611 interviews, and in
1982 of 7,962 interviews, administered
to samples of ever-married women and
single women (with own children at
home) between the ages of 15 and 44
(see Hendershot and Pratt, 1979, and
Bachrach et al., 1985, for descriptions
and technical documentation).

Catholic and Non-Catholic Childlessness

255

In our study we confine the sample to
ever-married, non-pregnant white
women between the ages of 35 and 44,
The analysis is restricted to evermarried women because, typically,
women who are not married do not have
to decide whether or not to have children because of societal norms proscribing having children outside marriage. In
developed societies such as the United
States, married women are those who
usually are the ones who decide whether
or not to have children. Were we not to
confine our analysis to ever-married
women, we would be mixing two very
different populations of women with regard to the incidence and determinants
of childlessness. We should add, however, that Catholics and non-Catholics
are different with respect to marital status. Catholics are less likely than nonCatholics to be currently married
(Mosher et al., 1986, p. 371), suggesting
that by restricting our study to evermarried women, we may well be introducing a kind of selectivity bias. However, since the 1976 data-set was
confined to ever-married women, and
since we wish here to compare and contrast patterns of childlessness in 1976
and in 1982, we have no choice but to
confine the study to ever-married
women.

Also, we restrict the analysis to
women between the ages of 35 and 44
because we want women in the sample
whose decision not to have children is
relatively permanent. Earlier analysis
(Poston and Kramer, 1981) has shown,
for instance, that childlessness among
younger women—say, those under the
age of 30—tends more frequently to be
defined by them as temporary. That is,
although they currently have no children, they more often than not state that
they plan to have a child or children in

the future. Also, as will be shown below,
we chose to study women in this older
age group because we wanted to have
women in the analysis who were in their
later years of childbearing at about the
time of 1976 when, according to Hout
and Greeley (1987), the behavior of
American Catholics began to undergo
dramatic change.

Finally, because of the markedly different patterns of childlessness by race
and ethnicity (Grindstaff, 1976; Poston
and Gotard, 1977; Davis, 1982), we
have restricted our samples to whites.

Later in the analysis, we divide the
women in our samples into voluntary,
involuntary, and temporary childless
categories and into a childed category.
This separation procedure is based on
the women’s responses to questions
dealing with expected family size, fecundity status, contraceptive use, and so
forth, and has been discussed in detail
elsewhere (Poston, 1976; Poston and
Kramer, 1983; Poston et al., 1983).

We determine the degree to which
differences in childlessness exist between Catholics and non-Catholics in
each of the two time periods of 1976 and
1982 with log-linear analyses. This is a
particularly appropriate methodology
for investigating a relatively rare phenomenon such as childlessness. Among
white women between the ages of 35
and 44 in 1976, only 7 per cent were
childless; in 1982, only 9 per cent were
childless. For a study of the degree to
which variables such as religious affiliation, and others such as religious activity
and educational attainment, along with
their interactions, are related to a phenomenon such as childlessness, loglinear analysis is preferred over an alternative approach such as multiple
regression (see Knoke, 1975, for discussion}.

Social Biology

Prior research dealing with the relationships between religious affiliation
and fertility and childlessness (see much
of the previously cited literature) indicates the importance of other independent variables, namely, religious activity and educational attainment.
Accordingly, our log-linear analyses
take childlessness as the dependent variable, along with three independent variables of religious affiliation (Catholic or
non-Catholic), religious activity and educational attainment.

We dichotomize religious activity
into categories of high and low. Catholics with high religious activity are those
who reported that they receive communion at least once a month; Catholics
with low activity, less than once a
month. Non-Catholics with high religious activity are persons who reported
that they attend church services at least
once a month; non-Catholics with low
activity, less than once a month. Educational attainment is trichotomized into
the categories of less than high school
completed, high schoo! completed, and
one or more years of college completed.
We turn now to the results of our study.

RESULTS

We are principally interested in ascertaining for 1976 and for 1982 the degree to which patterns of childlessness
differ between Catholic and nonCatholic women. For the two time penods, we examine a polychotomous dependent variable with the following four
categories: voluntarily childless, involuntarily childless, temporarily childless,
and childed.

Table 1 illustrates the general format
we used with the 1982 data-set in generating and examining log-linear models
of childlessness. For each model we folDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

scheme to identify the interaction effects. Table 1 includes for each model its
maximum likelihood ratio chi-square
value (G7), along with the number of degrees of freedom remaining, and the pvalue for the chi-square statistic. We
have also calculated the per cent change
in G? (i.e., the likelihood-ratio chiSquare statistic) from the baseline
model.

We determine which of the fourteen
models in Table 1 (Models 2-15)
presents the most parsimonious description of childlessness by examining the
magnitude of their chi-square statistics.
With the 1982 data-set, Model 12 accounts for almost 92 per cent of the baseline G’, and thus represents a better fit
than any of the other models (see Table
1). With the 1976 data-set, Model 12 accounts for more than 90 per cent of the
baseline model and is a better fit than
any of the other models (table not

shown). Therefore, for both data-sets,
the most parsimonious model appears
to be Model 12. This model examines
the main effects on childlessness of religious affiliation, religious activity, and
educational attainment; it also examines
the interaction effects on childlessness
of religious affiliation with religious activity, and of religious affiliation with
educational attainment.

Using the multiplicative tau parameters from Model 12 for 1976 and for 1982
(the actual tau parameters are not
shown), we have calculated expected
odds-ratios, shown in Table 2. For a
polychotomous dependent variable
such as the childlessness variable examined here, an expected odds-ratio indicates the chances of a particular group,
say the Catholics, versus the other
group, the non-Catholics, of being in
one category of the dependent variable,
rather than being in any of the other
three outcome categories.

We have calculated odds-ratios in Table 2 following the procedures set forth
by Daymont and Kaufman (1979). Observe the top line of Table 2. In 1976,
Catholics were only 0.07 times as likely
as non-Catholics to be voluntarily childless as against being in any of the other
three outcome categories. In 1982, their
odds had fallen to 0.00. All of the oddsratios for 1976 and for 1982 for Catholics
versus non-Catholics of being voluntarily childless instead of being in any of the
other outcome categories are substantially less than 1.00, indicating that in all
comparisons Catholics are less likely
than non-Catholics to be voluntarily
childless. And in all comparisons of the
1976 odds-ratios with those for 1982, the
odds-ratios have moved closer to zero.
Indeed, in two of the 1976-1982 comparisons, the odds-ratios have moved to
zero. These data do not provide any indication of a convergence between 1976
and 1982 in the propensity of Catholic
women, versus non-Catholic women, to
be voluntarily chiidless. In fact, the
odds-ratios shown in Table 2 indicate
that Catholic and non-Catholic women
have become more, rather than less dissimilar, with regard to voluntary childlessness.

We turn now to the odds-ratios pertaining to involuntary childlessness. In
1976, Catholic women had more than 10
times the chances of non-Catholics of
being involuntarily childless, than of being in any of the other outcome categories. By 1982, their odds had increased
to more than 17. All of the odds-ratios
for 1976 ana for 1982 for Catholics versus non-Catholics of being involuntarily
childless instead of being in any of the
other outcome categories, except one,
are greater than 1.0. In 1976, Catholics
with high religious activity, versus nonCatholics with high activity, were more

 

Catholic and Non-Catholic Childlessness 259

than 20 times as likely to be involuntarily childless than to be in any of the other
outcome categories; by 1982, Catholics
were more than 24 times as likely to be
involuntarily childless. Only among
women in 1976 with one or more years
of college were Catholics compared to
non-Catholics less likely to be involuntarily childless and more likely to be in
one of the other outcome categories.

With respect to changes in the oddsratios between 1976 and 1982, in most of
the cases, Catholic women, compared
to non-Catholic women, increased,
rather than decreased, their chances of
being involuntarily childless. As was the
case with voluntary childlessness, the
odds-ratios pertaining to involuntary
childlessness do not indicate a convergence between Catholics and nonCatholics during the period.

Before ending this discussion, we
need to make one additional observation. The odds-ratios for the childed
show that there have been reductions
between 1976 and 1982 in the propensities of Catholic women versus nonCatholic women to have children. In
1976, Catholics compared to nonCatholics were almost 4 times more
likely to have children than to be childless. By 1982, this odds-ratio had declined to less than 1.0. And in most of
the other comparisons, there have been
similar kinds of reductions between
1976 and 1982 in the propensity of Catholic women, versus non-Catholic
women, to have children. In other
words, with regard to actual fertility behavior, our data show the type of convergence between Catholics and nonCatholics found by many other
demographers (e.g., Westoff and Jones,
1977) But with regard to voluntary and
involuntary childlessness, our data do
not show such a convergence. We ad

dress this intriguing finding in the next

DISCUSSION

The major objective of this paper has
been to ascertain the degree to which
Catholics and non-Catholics differ in
their patterns of childlessness. We examined this question by focusing on
women in 1976 and in 1982 who were
voluntarily, involuntarily, and temporarily childless, as well as those with
children.

Given the long-standing emphasis by
the Roman Catholic Church regarding
the importance of children in marriage
and the family, an emphasis that was not
significantly altered during the Second
Vatican Council, we reasoned that
Catholic women should be less disposed
than non-Catholic women to be voluntarily childless. Regarding involuntary
childlessness, we identified a number of
structural and behavioral patterns,
some of them based in Catholic theology and regulations, leading us to expect Catholic women to be more likely
than non-Catholic women to be involuntarily childless.

Our analyses indicated that in both
1976 and in 1982 the chances were quite
a bit less for Catholics compared to nonCatholics to be voluntarily childless as
against being in one of the other three
categories, even after controlling for the
effects of religious activity and educational attainment. We also found that
the odds were very high for Catholics
versus non-Catholics to be involuntarily
childless.

Our analyses also indicated that the
odds for Catholics versus non-Catholics
of being voluntarily childless grew
smaller between 1976 and 1982, but that
the odds of being involuntarily childless

increased. But with respect to actual fertility behavior, we found that the odds of
Catholic women, versus non-Catholic
women, having children actually decreased between 1976 and 1982, a finding consistent with those of other demographers (e.g., Westoff and Jones,
1977) regarding a convergence in the
fertility patterns of Catholics and nonCatholics.

The question we need to address now
is the following: Given the reported convergence in fertility behavior of Catholics and non-Catholics, why then do our
findings also show over the 1976-1982
period that Catholics have become less
likely than non-Catholics to be voluntarily childless, but more likely to be involuntarily childless?

In an attempt to answer this question,
we will review for a moment a major
event in the Catholic Church that occurred in the late 1960’s, and its impacts
on the life and behavior of American
Catholics. Perhaps the most significant
development in the past two decades,
insofar as having an impact on the behavior of American Catholics is concerned, was the publication in 1968 of
Humanae Vitae, the encyclical of Pope
Paul VI proscribing the use of artificial
birth control. The issuance of this directive was very much unexpected; indeed,
Hout and Greeley (1987) have written
that American Catholics expected “‘in
the climate of change surrounding the
Second Vatican Council (1962-65) . . .
that a change in Church teaching on
contraception was also in the offing”
(1987, p. 332). They further note that
when “Pope Paul reiterated the traditional ban on birth control methods
other than rhythm, even within marriage, the response from American
Catholics ... was threefold. Some
Catholics discredited the Pope’s authorDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

ity to teach on matters of sexuality.
Some stopped listening to Church teaching on a wide range of sexual issues,
becoming even more liberal on matters
of sexual conduct than they were before
the encyclical. Some quit going to
Church, except, in most cases, on major
holidays” (Hout and Greeley, 1987,
p. 332).

Hout and Greeley show that during
the late 1960's and early 1970's, there
was a downward trend in church attendance among Catholics in the United
States that bottomed out in about 1975.
The authors indicate that during this period “American Catholics reduced their
participation in religious services by
one-third” (1987, p. 341). And they find
strong empirical support for the position
that ‘disagreement with the Pope’s sexual teaching . . . sparked the disaffection that reduced attendance” (1987,
p. 341), although they note as well that
the three behavioral responses of American Catholics to Humanae Vitae were
correlated.

What was responsible for the halt in
the slide in Catholic attendance at
church? Hout and Greeley write that it
was certainly not due “to a resolution to
the crisis of papal authority to teach
about sexuality; willingness to accept
Catholic ecclesiastical authority on sexual matters has continued to erode since
1975” (1987, p. 341). They note that it is
“loyalty (to Catholicism, their ‘birthright’) that separates those who stay and
fight within the organization from those
who get disgusted and leave.” The loyalty thesis assesses the decline and subsequent leveling of Catholic church attendance as the consequence of a
one-time shock. Humanae Vitae discouraged some American Catholics
who expected a revision of Church
teaching on marital sexuality. Over the

Catholic and Non-Catholic Childlessness 261

course of six to seven years, this discouragement motivated some Catholics to
curtail their participation at church services. Hout and Greeley (1987) believe
that church attendance stopped declining around 1975 because “the decline
was rooted in a single event that had dramatic consequences for church attendance but which ceased to matter once all
of those people who were likely to respond had reduced their participation to
its lowest limit’? (Hout and Greeley,
1987, p. 341; for more discussion of the
loyalty thesis, see Greeley, 1990, Chapter 2).

These findings of Hout and Greeley
give a basis for developing an interpretation of our findings that between 1976
and 1982 Catholics compared to nonCatholics became more likely to be involuntarily childless and less likely to be
voluntarily childless. We first note that
1976, the year the fertility survey was
conducted, was but a year following the
year that the decline in Catholic church
attendance had bottomed out. Hout and
Greeley suggest that this was just about
the time that the detachment of many
Catholics from their church also reached
its lowest levels. It is important to recognize, however, that although this detachment was most strikingly represented by declining church attendance,
it was not restricted to those who
stopped going to church. Indeed a feeling of alienation and dissatisfaction with
the Catholic Church in general characterized church attenders and nonattenders alike. But in about 1975 the “negative impact of unpopular teachings
about human sexuality ... probably
spent itself’ (Hout and Greeley, 1987,
p. 340), and the loyalty of American
Catholics to their Church and ‘“‘birthright” was then tending to “counteract
the disorganizing pressure of dissension

within the American Catholic Church”
(Hout and Greeley, 1987, p. 340).

The patterns of childlessness reported by American Catholics in the
year of 1976, we suggest, are the patterns of a population of American Catholics, many of whom for the preceding
five or more years had been significantly
alienated from the Church. However,
the patterns of voluntary and involuntary childlessness of American Catholics
in the year 1982 are the patterns of Catholics at a point in time some eight years
after many of them had returned to a
more regular schedule of church attendance, and after an even larger proportion had become less detached and
alienated from the Church.

Weare suggesting that the tendencies
of American Catholics, compared to
non-Catholics, during the period of
1976-82, to decrease their odds of being
voluntarily childless, and to increase
their chances of being involuntarily
childless, is due in large part to the reductions during this period of a general
feeling of detachment and alienation of
American Catholics from their church.
Many returned to their church at the beginning of this period and began to participate more fully and to play a more active role. Those who had not stopped
attending after Humanae Vitae was issued, but felt during the late 1960’s and
early 1970's varying degrees of dissatisfaction and alienation, perhaps began to
experience in the mid-1970s and early
1980’s a reduction in these feelings. In
the period from 1976 to 1982, both
groups, we suggest, became more inclined to follow the various normative
expectations and proscriptions of the
Church.

We hold that in the process of returning and/or becoming more attached to
their church, American Catholics be
Social Biology

came increasingly inclined to accept
more readily than they had in the 1970's
the long-standing norms about the importance of children in marriage. This
does not mean that Catholics are now
inclined to subscribe to the Church’s position against artificial contraception; indeed current data indicate that they do
not do so (Goldscheider and Mosher,
1988, Table 3). This acceptance merely
suggests that although Catholics have
reduced their fertility to levels approximating those of non-Catholics, this has
not involved their becoming as voluntarily childless as non-Catholics. Indeed,
our data show that they have become
less inclined to be voluntarily childless.
During this period characterized by reductions in the degrees of detachment
and alienation of American Catholics
from their church, Catholics became
better Catholics, at least with respect to
the long-standing expectations of the
importance of one or more (although
not too many more) children in marrage.

With regard to the increasing likelihood of American Catholics, compared
to non-Catholics, during this 1976-82
period to be involuntarily childless, the
same kind of interpretation may be invoked. In the process of becoming less
detached and alienated from the norms
and expectations of their church, American Catholics became more disposed
than they had been a few years previously to subscribe to one or more of the
normative expectations of the Catholic
Church that are associated with involuntary childlessness. Perhaps there was an
increase in the participation of single
Catholics in the three-to-six month consultations with clergy prior to marriage,
hence resulting in an increase in their
age at first marriage; and/or an increase
in the acceptance among childless CathDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

Vol. 37, No. 3-4

olics of the proscriptions of the Church
with regard to divorce. An increased
tendency to subscribe to any of these or
other expectations would Jead to an increase in those behaviors likely to result
in an increase between 1976 and 1982 in
the odds of Catholics, compared to nonCatholics, being involuntarily childless.

Although obviously after the fact, the
above interpretation does provide at
least some basis for our findings that
whereas during the period of 1976 to
1982 the fertility behavior of Catholics
tended to converge with that of nonCatholics, their patterns of voluntary
and involuntary childlessness patterns
tended not to converge. Even after controlling for educational attainment and
religious activity, Catholics compared to
non-Catholics have decreased their
odds of being voluntarily childless,
while increasing their odds of being involuntarily childless. The main reason
behind these changes in childlessness

Catholic and Non-Catholic Childlessness 263

between 1976 and 1982, we believe, was
the tendency of American Catholics to
become less detached and alienated
from the norms and expectations of
their church, and more disposed, than
they had been a few years previously, to
subscribe to one or more of the normative expectations of the Catholic Church
that are associated with voluntary and
involuntary childlessness.
