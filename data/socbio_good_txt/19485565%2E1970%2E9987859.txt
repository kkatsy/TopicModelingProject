Lactase Deficiency and Yogurt

The findings of hereditary lactase deficiency and lactose intolerance in a high
proportion of Asian and African adults
(Keusch et al., 1969; Huang and Bayless,
1968) suggests that they might consume
milk products in a more digestible form than
afforded by fresh milk. Indeed it is clear
that in many Asian and African countries
yogurt and similar milk products are the
predominant milk-like food for adults and
post-weaning children. This raises the question of whether yogurt, for example, Js a
traditional means of exploiting an environmental resource which is otherwise of low
nutritive value—that is, whether yogurt is
an “unintentional” dietary compensation
for a hereditary, metabolic defect just as a
diet low in phenylalanine is an intentional
compensation for the hereditary, metabolic
defect involved in phenylketonuria.

If this argument is valid, one would expect yogurt to have a lower content of

 

lactose than fresh milk, and so it does
(Jacobs, 1958, p. 340-342). This lower
lactose content evidently reflects a conversion of Jactose to readily digestible products,
such as glucose and galactose; that is, the
bacteria used to produce yogurt produce the
enzyme lactase (Thimann, 1963, p. 580).
By all indications, then, the metabolic defect of lactase deficiency in man can be
circumvented by proper treatment of milk.
A recent report mentions the use of yogurt
and other fermented milk products by
Asians and Africans intolerant of lactose
(Bayless and Huang, 1969).

On the basis of these considerations, the
concerns raised (“Can Asians Digest Lactose?”’ 1969) about the usefulness of providing Asian and African countries with
powdered milk seem unwarranted. The milk
need not be consumed as “fresh” milk; it
can be used for making yogurt.
