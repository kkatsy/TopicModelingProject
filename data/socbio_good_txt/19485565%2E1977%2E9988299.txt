ABSTRACT: The Lipoprotein Family Study of Japanese-Americans in Hawaii is described. Measured effects of the behavioral, social, and physiological milieu (apart from age and sex) account
for little of the variance. Subsequent papers will consider the genetic and cultural causes of family

resemblance in this material.

Lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in
plasma are subject to behavioral, social,
and physiological sources of variation
which must be allowed for in any study
designed to resolve the contributions of
environment, polygenes, and major loci to
family resemblance (Rao et al., in press).
Here we consider a large sample from
which blood was taken after a twelve-hour
fast.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In 1970-72 a probability sample was
drawn from the Honolulu Heart Study
cohort of Japanese males born during the
twenty years before 1920 and living on the
island of Oahu. From the remainder of the
cohort, a selected sample was chosen on
the basis of the upper 10 per cent of casual
cholesterol, the upper 10 per cent of casual
triglyceride, definite coronary heart disease, and/or definite cerebrovascular disease. Individuals were excluded who refused participation, who were nonfasting
at the time of examination, or whose
lipoprotein typing was incomplete. Data
on the 2,780 participants (from 3,407 men
contacted) have been previously reported
(Rhoads et al., 1976).

To investigate family resemblance for

lipoproteins, a control was drawn from the
above probability sample on the third digit
of the ID number. From the remainder of
the subjects (those not in the probability
sample) a selected sample was defined on
elevated fasting beta cholesterol or triglyceride or myocardial infarction confirmed by ECG. Individuals without living wife and children were excluded from
both samples. The 1,850 wives and children of these men constitute the Lipoprotein Family Study carried out in 1972-73
(Figure 1 and Table 1).

We have considered 8 lipoprotein traits
(Table 2). Two of these are electrophoretic
attributes which were transformed to
probits (Tables 3 and 4). Lipemia (L) was
defined by a principal component analysis
of total cholesterol and In triglyceride.

RESULTS

For this analysis we defined four personal attributes besides age and sex which
might be related to the lipoprotein
traits—smoking, alcohol, obesity, and
hematocrit (Table 5). The floating beta
trait was not significantly influenced by
any measured factor. With that exception,
all factors have significant effects on some
lipoprotein traits. Age and sex have rela

0.05oa and decreases HDL cholesterol by
0.110 even when other factors are held
constant (Table 6).

Factors like acculturation, social class,
exercise, and diet were assessed by questionnaire for the paternal sample only
(Belsky et al., 1971). These factors were
combined with age, sex, and other factors
noted above into indices which estimate
their effects on the various lipoprotein
traits in the fathers (Morton et al., 1977).

For children and spouses, these unobserved factors were substituted for paternal values.

For each lipoprotein trait, multiple regression gave an index Y based on all
covariates and an index Z when only age
and sex variables were used. Then Y — Z
is an index adjusted for age and sex. Table
6 shows that the adjusted index accounts
for little more variation than the individual factors (smoking, alcohol, obesity, and
hematocrit). Orr et al. (1975) reported that
socioeconomic status accounts for only 1.8
and 0.6 per cent of the age-adjusted variance of Jn cholesterol in Caucasian males
and females, respectively. In substantial
agreement, we find that the adjusted index, which includes behavioral and physiological as well as social factors, accounts
for only 2.3 per cent of the variance of
cholesterol.

American Caucasians (Rhoads et al.,

increase in coronary heart disease (Kagan
et al., 1975).

Although behavioral, social, and physiological determinants as measured account for little of the variance of lipoprotein concentrations, this finding does not
prove that environment makes a small
contribution to family resemblance. Path
analysis gives an estimate of the unmeasured proportion of family environment.
Providing this proportion is not too large,

cultural and biological inheritance can be
resolved. The relative variance due to
family environment is small in nuclear
families (Rao et al., 1977), but is greater
for twins (Iselius, ms.). Assessment of
measurable determinants is a first step toward conclusions of this nature, providing
indices which permit resolution of cultural
and biological inheritance in nuclear families without requiring twins or adopted
children (Rao et al., 1976).
