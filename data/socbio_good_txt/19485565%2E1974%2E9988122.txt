Male-Female Differences in Family Size
Preferences Among College Students

Fertility studies done in North America
since World War IT have generally ignored
the gender of respondents as a potentially
important factor in accounting for variations in either achieved or preferred family size. Although a number of investigators
(see, especially, Blake, 1966, 1967, 1968,
1974) have reported research findings
showing clear patterns of differences in fertility values and attitudes between males
and females, this fact has so far failed to
attract attention as a major focus of
analysis and discussion.

The purpose of this paper is to explore
this topic and its implications using data
on fertility preferences of unmarried male
and female students attending selected
North American colleges and universities
between 1967 and 1973. Documentation of
sex differences in family size desires is presented, and social science researches offering possible explanations for the sex
differences are reviewed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Since 1963, the authors, independent
of each other, have undertaken college
and university surveys at eight campuses
located in the Northwestern United States
and in the Atlantic provinces of Canada.
Among our mutual interests was the in
vestigation of fertility preferences reported
by male and female subjects.

A summary of our findings is reported
in Table 1 along with those of Westoff and
Potvin (1967) and of Buckhout (1972).
Our principal interest lies in documenting
substantive patterns. Generalizations with
respect to the population universe of North
American male and female students enrolled at institutions of higher learning is,
of course, not possible due to the diverse
nature of our samples from the standpoint
of design, size, geographical location, and
date of execution. With this limitation in
mind, the figures at the extreme right of
Table 1 indicate clearly that sex differences
do exist. On the average, women want
more children than do men, and the differences vary from two- to seven-tenths
of a child depending on the religious faith
of the respondent.

The figures shown in Tables 2 and 3
permit a more detailed analysis of the sex
differentials with a variety of relevant
demographic-sociological factors controlled.
In Table 2, mean desired family sizes are
compared between sexes for the combined
samples of Catholic students attending
Seattle University and the University of
Washington in 1967. The following simultaneous controls were introduced: race (all

* The question asked was: “To what extent was religion included in the home activities of your paternal family? For
example, family prayers, bible reading, discussion, saying grace at meals?’ Responses: 1, seldom if at all; 2, less than

average; 3, average; 4, more than average; 5, 4 great deal.

Caucasian), age (21-23), marital status
(all single), religious affiliation (all Catholic), amount of schooling (all seniors),
amount of Catholic schooling (all, some, or
none), and five separate measures of
parental religiosity (high-low). Both the
GAF and Princeton studies had shown
these variables to be correlated with desired and actual family size.

Again, with due respect for the small
sample sizes, a pattern of larger female
family size desires is clearly discernible.
The differences between men and women
amount to an average of approximately
seven-tenths of a child which is of the
same order of magnitude as that shown
for the separate samples in the second row
of Table 1. Furthermore, no substantial

changes are evident when number of respondent’s siblings is substituted for the
index of parental religiosity.

In Table 3, the five academic institutions
surveyed in Atlantic Canada in 1969 are
combined to make the data more manageable as well as comparable with those
shown in the previous table. The controls
employed include those cited above with
the exception of amount of schooling
(freshmen and seniors are combined).
Here again, we find substantial differences
between males and females, irrespective of
respondents’ religious affiliation.

point? Some might argue affirmatively,
in that it is an unreasonable expectation
to believe that young unmarried students
of either sex are ready to seriously choose
a specific family size value and defend it
with any cogency. Some empirical support
for this contention was provided by subjects in our 1973 sample, 20 per cent of
whom were unable to give a single reason
in support of the specific family value
preference they had indicated. Remarks
such as “How ¢an you realistically expect
us to answer questions like this?” were

not uncommon and provide some indication
of the difficulty the respondents had in
determining a preferred family size.

An alternative approach would be to ask
respondents to indicate a size range for
their future family, on the assumption
that they can feel more certain about their
desired low and high values. Our 1973
sample was asked to choose from three
size ranges; the results are shown in Table 4. Here, sex differences are compared
with and without control for religious affiliation.

The modal family size range category
frequently cited in the fertility literature
as descriptive of the “moderately sized
North American family” is two to four
children. Figures from different publications show that a high proportion (over
80 per cent) of the attitudes sampled fall
within this range. Most of these preferences are indicated by married respondents
and derived from the summation of responses to particular family size choices;
that is, by adding the proportions of respondents who prefer two, three, and four
children. Our approach provides a more
conservative test of the degree of preference for the 2-4 child range among college
students by seeking to document the range
itself. The remaining two family size
range categories in Table 4 provide some
indication of the proportion of respondents
who expand the 2-4 range to below replacement level (i.e., 0-4, 1-4, 0-3, and
1-3) and to above four (i.e., 2~5 plus).

The data show that despite the conservative nature of the test most of our
respondents (40-50 per cent) still endorse
the 2-4 family size range. Sex differences
within this range are minimal. However,
on the lower and upper sides of the twoto-four range, differences between the
sexes obtain. More men than women signify
commitment to the lower (A) range; conversely, more women than men prefer the
higher (C) range. Even more interesting
are the differences between Protestant men
and women in the A and C ranges. In the
A range, the difference favors the males
(38 per cent) over the females (27 per
cent). In the C range the difference favors
the women (26 per cent) over the males
{12 per cent). In sum, the data in Table
4 provide further indication that substantial differences in family-size preferences
exist between males and females.

To gain more insight into these differences we examined the frequency distribu

tions of the family-size preferences in four
separate sample surveys—Westoff and Potvin, 1963; Nobbe, 1967; Okraku, 1969;
Nobbe and Okraku, 1973. The results of
the analysis (Table 5), done separately for
Catholics and Protestants in each sample,
corroborate the differences noted earlier.
The data also suggest that important
changes in the proportions of men and
women indicating preference for various
family-size values may have been occurring since 1963. We have summarized
these changes separately for Catholics and
Protestants in light of the apparent influence of religious affiliation in the dependent variable. However, we are aware
that there is an obvious methodological
limitation in interpreting the data in Table 5 in terms of changes over time. Because of the diverse nature of the samples
involved, it is quite conceivable that the
differences evident in Table 5 reflect not
so much changes in family size preference
patterns as differences in the types of institutional and geographical environments
sampled.

It appears that increasingly smaller percentages of Catholic men and women endorse preferences for five or more children,
the rapidity of this decline being especially
prominent among women (53 per cent in
1963 down to 14 per cent in 1973). In
fact, in the 1969 and 1973 samples, the sex
differentials at this value level are virtually
nonexistent.

Approximately one-third of our male
and female subjects at three time periods
(1967, 1969, and 1973) are partial to a
four-child family. Again, slightly greater
percentages of women than men favor this
fertility value.

Most dramatic perhaps are the apparent
increases in the preferences for two or fewer
children, and also for three children. For
Catholic women, the attractiveness of a
three-child family seems to have increased

steadily over the decade. The percentage Unfortunately, the sex comparisons

of women of all religions who desire two
or fewer children has also increased markedly. At the same time, it appears that
Catholic male students have been increasingly interested in a two-child family.
Thirty-two per cent of our 1973 male
respondents chose that value compared
with 15 per cent in the 1967 sample.

In sum, the impression created by these
data is that of an optimal range between
three and four children preferred by Catholic students, with women favoring the
higher of the two values at the present
time.

 

among Protestants are available only for
1969 and 1973. Even with that limitation,
changes are evident. There are substantial
declines in the number of men and women
desiring five or more children. Proportionately, however, twice as many women as
men at both time periods fall in this category.

The proportionate declines over time are
also evident for males and females in the
four-child family category, although the declines here have been more pronounced
among males. Three times as many women
as men preferred this particular fertility

value in the 1973 sample, whereas there
was virtually no difference between the
sexes in the 1969 sample.

While there is considerable agreement
among the sexes concerning the desirability
of three children in both the 1969 and
1973 samples, the comparison of greatest
surprise occurs in the two-children-orfewer category. Though the sex differentials remain in the expected direction (i.e.,
more men than women desiring two children or fewer), there is a substantial inCrease in the magnitudes of the percentages
of both sexes choosing this category during
the four-year interval.

Our data suggest that the optimal range
of children wanted by Protestants lies between two and three, with males preferring the former value and women the
latter figure.

DISCUSSION

The data we have presented above demonstrate clearly that substantial differences in family size preferences exist
between college men and women, with the
latter preferring higher values than the
former; and that these differences remain
after the effects of a variety of demographic and social factors have been taken
into account. The socialization process by
which humans acquire their sex roles from
family, school, and significant reference
groups such as peers is usually invoked
as a possible explanation of these sex differentials. Of direct relevance here, of
course, is the acquisition of roles that
eventually translate into marriage, motherhood, and housewife for women and marriage, fatherhood, and work for men
(Parsons and Bales, 1955). In the words
of Judith Blake (1972, p. 5):

Role differentiation by sex in American

society makes actual or anticipated parent
heod a pre-condition for all other aspects

of men’s and women’s roles. The content of
sex roles—men’s and women’s “spheres”—

Male-Female Family Size Preferences

285

uses as a bench mark the sexually differentiated relation to child-bearing and rearing. The feminine role is normatively
maternal and, hence, intra-familial, “integrative,” emotionally supportive, and “expressive.” The masculine role is normatively
paternal and, as a result, primarily the
complement of the maternal role—extrafamilial, protective, economically supportive,
and “instrumental” (or “task-oriented”) ....

Her summary aptly characterizes the
responses given by our student subjects in
the 1973 sample to a question concerning
their most important reason for indicating
a specific family value preference. Fortyeight per cent of the females, as compared
to 27 per cent of the males, answered in
terms of content that centered around
such themes as family cohesion, interpersonal relations between the children themselves and/or mother-child, and biological
fulfillment, and size of family of orientation.

By contrast, the modal category of response to this question by males was in
terms of content that related to work and
income. The importance of breadwinning,
developing a career, and meeting financial
ends was stressed by 25 per cent of the
men and 15 per cent of the women.

Recent empirical studies (Rosenkrantz
et al., 1968; Broverman et al., 1972) of
college students dealing with self-concepts
and sex role stereotypes lend further
credence to this view at the psychological
level. Broverman et al. (1972, p. 75), for
example, summarize their findings as
follows:

Women are perceived as relatively less
competent, less independent, less objective,
and less logical than men; men are perceived as lacking interpersonal sensitivity,
warmth, and expressiveness in comparison
to women. Moreover, stereotypically masculine traits are more often perceived to be
desirable than are stereotypically feminine
characteristics. Most importantly, both men
and women incorporate both the positive
and negative traits of the appropriate stereotype into their self-concepts. Since more
feminine traits are negatively valued than
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

286

are masculine traits, women tend to have
more negative self-concepts than do men.
The tendency for women to denigrate themselves in this manner can be seen as evidence of the powerful social pressures to
conform to the sex role standards of the
society ....

The pronatalistic implications of such
findings are evident. Women want children
and within a range determined by the extent of their endorsement of prescribed as
well as proscribed role expectations. Several
studies (e.g., Clarkson et al., 1970; Hoffman and Wyatt, 1960), as well as reviews
of studies (e.g., Blake, 1965) provide indirect evidence in support of this view.
Unfortunately, none of these studies was
able to establish a direct causal link between sex role attitudes and actual fertility. A closer approximation is achieved
in a recent investigation of single Catholic
college females (Broverman et al., 1972)
in which the authors observed that ideal
family size desires and maternal employment aspirations varied as a function of
the women’s perceived self-concept measured in terms of a cluster of male-valued
competency traits. High competency scores
were associated with low family-size preferences and strong propensities for work
outside the family as a married mother.
Most regrettably, there seems to be no
similar research in which young males are
also the object of study.

In recent years, demographers have also
become more aware of the importance of
early socialization in the shaping of fertility norms of young adolescents and teen
_ agers (e.g., Westoff and Potvin, 1967;

Gustavus and Nam, 1970). Westoff and
Potvin (1967) have argued that number
of siblings may be an important determinant in shaping family size norms during
the period of late childhood to early
adolescence. Their research established
modest but positive correlations between
size of family of orientation and size of

family desired among Protestant and Catholic females. If it could be shown that the
relationship between these two variables
was substantially higher among women
relative to men, then this factor could be
investigated as a possible explanation for
sex differences in family size preferences.
However, our analyses do not support this
view. Our correlation coefficients for number of siblings and preferred family size
were positive in sign and of almost exactly
the same order of magnitude for Protestants and Catholics as those shown in the
Westoff-Potvin research; but there were
no differences by sex worthy of mention.
Another possible source of explanation
for the family size differences established
in this study is the socialization experiences of adults. Smuts (1959) in a thorough
demographic review argued that changes
in the feminine role, such as increased employment, should not be taken to mean
that women were forsaking their traditional family obligations of childbearing
and childraising. In fact, he points out that
married women are particularly likely to
work before the birth of the first child
and after the Jast child has been enrolled
in school. The latter trend in particular
accounted for the major increase in the
female labor force participation in the
United States between 1940 and 1960
(Oppenheimer, 1957). Hartley (1960, p.
156) subsequently undertook extensive indepth interviews with a small sample of
working mothers and arrived at a similar
conclusion. She writes:
Most of the working mothers we interviewed consider their work as an aspect of
the nurturant function. It is another way in
which they can serve their families—they
add to it the traditional roster of womanly
duties and see it as another way of helping

their husbands and providing for the needs
of their children....

side the home. Research on changes in the
role structure of the family, for example,
has shown that the wife’s power in rolebargaining is related to her employment
(Heer, 1958). However, the evidence in
support of this finding is not conclusive
(Hoffman, 1960). Furthermore, the connection between an increase in a woman’s
effective social power and the change in
her family size preference has never been
examined to our knowledge.

SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

Sex differentials in desired family size
may be profitably studied in the years
ahead by more sustained and intensive research on male and female subjects (both
unmarried and married) using family size
preference as the dependent variable. However, what is problematic with such survey work is the penchant for adhering to
“slobal” variables (e.g., social class, religion, race, ethnicity, place of residence,
size of family of orientation) and establishing the existence of relationships between these variables and some measure of
fertility. Occasionally, the demographer is
content to terminate the analysis at this
point. More frequently, however, some
effort is made to interpret the relationships, often in terms of social psychological factors which are usually not amenable
to further empirical scrutiny and analysis
because the appropriate data were never
collected. We suggest more longitudinal
studies (e.g., Gustavus and Nam, 1970)
conducted on smaller samples of men and
women starting with the period of early
adolescence (say, age 8 to 13) and continuing through later years. The interviews
should be in-depth and of an unstructured
nature, designed to get at the qualitative
content of family life that is routinely
passed,

As for the sex variable in this type of
research, we would suggest work along

two possible lines of inquiry. First, a more
thorough investigation is needed to assess
the impact of working and nonworking
mothers on their children’s (especially
daughters’) attitudes about what family
and work roles they will choose as adults.
Research findings show, for example, that
significantly more daughters of working
mothers indicate interest in selecting nontraditional vocations than do daughters of
nonworking mothers (Hartley, 1960). This
finding is consistent with research conducted on career saliency as perceived by
college women (Almquist and Angrist,
1971). Here, it was found that careerdirected women students had been significantly more strongly influenced by college
professors and occupational role models
than were noncareer-directed students. By
logical extension, it may be found that
prospective wives influenced by such
“models” will prefer fewer children relative to young women not exposed to such
models,

A second line of research inquiry centers around studies of family social structure and value consensus. Writers such as
Winch (1963) have noted the increase of
the isolated nuclear family in the United
States as the ideal type of family form
espoused by the urban middle class.
Characteristic of this family type among
middle-class populations is the stress on
egalitarianism between spouses, involving
decreasing differentiation of stereotyped
parental sex roles and a greater emphasis
on compromise, cooperation, and joint decision-making concerning all vital aspects
of family life. The implications for fertility
would seem to be an increased sensitivity
on the part of marriage partners towards
differences in their attitudes about number
of children wanted. How these differences
are resolved requires that we view the
prospective couples’ family-formation behavior as an outcome of a decision-making

process. An intensive longitudinal study
along these lines (Kammeyer, 1972) is
currently in progress.

Thus far we have treated family size
desires as a dependent variable and suggested various lines of research that might
be related to it. Let us conclude by suggesting that there is also merit in treating
personal family size preferences as an independent variable for purposes of predicting actual family size.

Some will object on the grounds that
what single men and women want in the
way of children is too far removed from
the realities of life—marriage, work experience, contraceptive practice, along
with a host of other factors—to be of
much predictive utility; that a more accurate predictor of actual family size is
determined by asking the subject to indicate what he or she can realistically expect. There is empirical support for this
view from the GAF and Princeton studies
which have focused on married women
and/or couples.

Social Biology.

We remain somewhat skeptical, however,
that this trend will persist in the future.
In the first place, it seems reasonable to
suppose that the proportionate distribution
of children wanted in that two-to-four
range will become increasingly skewed
toward the lower end. In fact, it appears
that the prospect of a two- or three-child
family is already being contemplated by
an increasing segment of the North American population. Secondly, the medical
technology for translating such desires into
actuality is either now at hand or soon
will be in the form of more efficient and
safe contraceptive techniques (male and
female), recourse to abortion, vasectomy,
and even perhaps biological regulation of
the sex of offspring.
