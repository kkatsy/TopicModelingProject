ABSTRACT: Utilizing a subsample of the 1970 National Fertility Survey and discriminant analysis, the choice of contraceptive method was examined. First, choice from among rhythm,
chemicals, condoms, oral pill, and [UD was examined. Two significant characteristic dimensions
were isolated. The first dimension was interpreted as a distinction among methods from moreeffective to less-effective. The second dimension was concluded to represent an aesthetics-health
dimension, dividing methods between coitus-related versus not-coitus-related. Second, the choice
between these methods and sterilization was examined. The results indicated that income and
the number of births to be averted play an important role in the choice of sterilization.

Most research on family planning has
concentrated on either the nature of adopters or factors affecting continuation. One
aspect of family planning that has received
little attention is the factors affecting
choice of method. Some studies employing
univariate techniques to examine the relation between socioeconomic variables and
method choice have been conducted
(Ryder and Westoff, 1972; Whelpton et
al., 1966). More recently, multivariate
analyses have been conducted examining
choice of method (Cochrane, 1975; Kahley
and Gillaspy, 1977). However, these studies have tended to concentrate on the
choice between two methods. The choice
of method from among a number of possibilities is an aspect of family planning
which has generally been ignored. This
paper reports on a multivariate analysis of
method choice from among a variety of
methods of family planning.

Methods of contraception widely used
not only in the United States but also in

much of the rest of the world include
rhythm, foams and other chemicals, condoms, oral pill, IUD, and sterilization.
Each of these methods has associated with
it a number of characteristics, including
cost, whether or not use is related to
coitus, aesthetic aspects, health side effects, religious and social implications of
use, use-effectiveness, reversibility, etc.
Furthermore, the potential adopter of a
family planning method has various
characteristics which determine needs and
preferences for one or more of the characteristics available in the different contraceptive methods. An individual will select that method which has associated
with it the characteristics that best satisfy
those needs and preferences.

The purpose of this research is to isolate, for the sample employed, those adopter characteristics which best differentiate
among adopters of the various methods.
In addition, it attempts to isolate those
contraceptive method characteristics

which are most important to the potential
adopter in determining choice of method.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The source of the data for the analysis
was the 1970 National Fertility Survey
(Ryder and Westoff, 1972). A subsample
was pulled with the following characteristics: (1) ages 35-44; (2) white; (3) do not
want any more children; (4) currently
fecund or sterilized for contraceptive purposes; (5) currently contracepting.

After some respondents were dropped
because of nonresponses, a sample of 241
respondents remained. Of these, 80
adopted sterilization; 34, rhythm; 15,
foams; 39, condoms; 15, diaphragm; 47,
oral pill; and 11 IUD.

In all, nine explanatory variables were
used in the analysis. These are defined as
follows:

RC = 1, if Catholic; otherwise, 0.

CI = 1, if church is an important factor in
the respondent’s life; otherwise, 0.

ER = education of the wife.

EH = education of the husband.

HY = income of the husband in thousands
of dollars.

RY = income of the wife in thousands of
dollars. _

CF = coital frequency in the last four weeks
prior to the interview.

CH = total number of children at the time
of the interview.

A = the number of births to be averted.

The last variable, A, requires explanation. The objective was to construct a
variable which would serve as an approximation of the number of births that could
be expected by a fecund woman from the
date of her last desired child (as defined by
the respondent) to age 50 if she were to use
no method of contraception. Thus, if she
wants no more children, this variable represents an attempt to measure the number
of births she must prevent. The variable
was calculated as follows:

A = (50-ALB) * PB ac)

Contraceptive Choice

43

where ALB = wife’s age at the birth of her
last child, and P(B,,) = probability per
year, given age, of a birth if xo contraception was employed (Henry, 1961). Certainly, .
such factors as the variability of fecundity
among women, recovery period after birth,
lactation period, and age at menopause, as
well as other factors, are not constants, but
rather are variable within the population
and may be employed in a more precise
measure of the number of births to be
averted through contraception. Though we
recognize the limitations of this method of
calculating the variable, the use of a more
sophisticated approach would have required
more information than was available.

DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS

For problems in which the objective is
to explain group membership, an appropriate multivariate technique is discriminant analysis. The objective of discriminant
analysis is to derive functions of explanatory variables which will maximize the
difference among groups of interest. These
functions may then be employed to predict
group membership. In essence, discriminant analysis is primarily concerned with
prediction of group membership. While it
is an interesting and useful technique, it is
not without drawbacks. The main problem is the difficulty of interpreting the results, and this difficulty increases markedly as the number of groups under examination increases. Still, for this research
problem, discriminant analysis appears to
be the most promising technique. The
program used for estimation is found in
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(Nie et al., 1975).

RESULTS

The analysis of contraceptive choice initially included seven choices—rhythm,
foam, condom, diaphragm, oral pill, IUD,

74 Gillaspy

and sterilization. Though the results were
encouraging, it was difficult to interpret
them since the sterilization group was
weighted so heavily in the sample. Furthermore, when examining group configurations among the alternative methods, sterilization appeared to represent
a significant departure from the other
techniques. This difference between sterilization and the other contraceptive
techniques may be at least partially explained by the more radical implications of
sterilization, so that potential adopters
may. perceive sterilization as a method
apart from and beyond more conventional
contraceptive methods.

Thus, a second analysis was performed
which included the six remaining choices.
These choices are more representative of
the range of methods one usually thinks of
as being contraceptives. After some initial
trial runs, five variables and two interactions were found to discriminate best
among the six groups. In all, five functions
were derived, but only the first two were
significant. Thus, this discussion will be
based upon these two functions. As may
be seen in Table 1, the education interaction term clearly is the best discriminator

Social Biology

in the first function, followed by the two
religion variables and their interaction
term. In the second function, the religion
interaction term was the best discriminator with the education interaction
term and education of the husband next.

In Table 2, the predictions of group
membership resulting from the estimations are presented, though it should be
noted that a prediction bias results from
such an exercise. A better measure of
overall explanatory power of the functions
is Wout? (Tatsuoka, 1970). This statistic
is an approximation of the proportion of
variability in group membership explained
by the two significant functions (similar to
the R2 in multiple regression analysis). In
this model, the two functions explain approximately 37 per cent of the variability
in group membership.

The group centroids are the mean discriminant scores for each group in each
function and may be employed to summarize the location of the groups in the
space defined by the functions (Nie et al.,
1975, p. 440). Examining the centroids of
the groups (Table 3), we find that a picture
of the effects of the discriminating variables on choice of method begins to de

velop. When the centroids of the first function are ranked according to magnitude,
two groups of method are evident. On the
one hand, IUD, diaphragm, and the pill
form one cluster, while foams, condoms,
and rhythm form the second cluster.

In Function 1, the religion variables are
important as discriminators. As there is an
interaction present, it is necessary to examine the effect of the two religion variables simultaneously. Holding the other
variables constant at their means, the effects of these two variables in reduced
space are as shown in Table 4. The biggest
effect occurs between Catholic and nonCatholic among those who do not feel
church is an important part of their lives.

The smallest effect occurs among Catholics who feel church is important versus
those who do not. In all, the non-Catholics
who feel church is not important are more
likely to select a contraceptive from among
the IUD-diaphragm-pill group while
Catholics who feel church is important are
more likely to choose from among the
foams-condoms-rhythm group.

Though the discriminating powers of
the religion variables seem to be most important for this function, the education
variables are also important. The total effect of these variables, holding the other
variables constant at their means, is
shown in Table 5 and is much as expected.
In general, education is positively associated with choice of a method from
among the IUD-diaphragm-pill group.

Therefore, with respect to the first function, the methods appear to be divided
along relatively straightforward socioreligious lines into a traditional versus nontraditional dimension. Thus, lower
status (as measured by education) religious
individuals are more likely to opt for the

foam-condom-rhythm group and vice
versa.

Examining the centroids of the second
function, a different picture emerges.
Again, the methods are divided into two
groups. This time, however, the first
group is composed of foam, condom, and
diaphragm while the second group is composed of pill, IUD, and rhythm. In the
second function, while the religion variables are still important, the education
variables seem to be taking on more importance. Furthermore, coital frequency is
more important than it was in the first
function.

Again, two interactions were present.
The effects of the religion interaction,
holding all other variables constant at
their means, are shown in Table 6. Interestingly enough, Non-Catholic/ChurchImportant and Catholic/Church-Not-Important are very similar, while Catholic/
Church-Important and non-Catholic/
Church-Not-Important are similar. Thus,
those with mixed religious convictions
on contraception find the foam-condomdiaphragm group of methods preferable, while those with strongest conviction
and those with the weakest find the

pill-IUD-rhythm group preferable. Quite
apart from the prohibition on such methods as the IUD and the pill, this
interaction may be indicating an
aesthetic-in-use-of-contraceptives dimension. Thus, those methods which are the
neatest and least coitus-related will be preferred by these two types of individuals.
Similarly, for Catholics with deep convictions, it has been reported that there are
strong prohibitions against handling
genitalia, which is required by foam, condom, and diaphragm. Thus, this interaction may be indicating an aesthetics dimension for preference.

At low and medium levels of wife’s education, the preference for the pill-TUDrhythm group increases as husband’s education increases (Table 7). This finding
probably reflects a preference for or
knowledge of the more effective methods
(pill and IUD). However, the opposite is
true for higher levels of wife’s education.
Indeed, the preference for the foamcondom-diaphragm group is greatest
when both the husband and the wife are
well educated. This interaction may be
indicating two characteristic dimensions
of contraceptives. First is the effectiveness
dimension for lower and medium levels of
wife’s education, similar to the effect
found in the first function. The second
characteristic dimension indicated may be
a health/safety dimension. If better educated women are more sensitive to and
knowledgeable about possible side effects
of contraceptives, then we might expect
them to shift back to methods which have

of characteristics, IUD-pill-diaphragm

health dimension. In this second dimension of characteristics, pill-[UD-rhythm
would be considered aesthetically superior
while foam-condom-diaphragm would be
perceived as having fewer serious side effects. These two dimensions, therefore,

criminating power between these two
groups. Further, the religion variables
were found to be Jess important and no
interaction was discovered. Instead, four
new variables and their interactions were
found to be of primary importance—
number of children, number of births the
couple desires to avert, income of the hus-.
band, and income of the wife. In Table 8
the two religion variables are both shown
to have a negative impact on the preference for sterilization. Thus, Catholics and
those who feel church is important were
more likely to select one of the six conventional methods. The predictions of group
membership from the estimations are presented in Table 9.

The remaining variables are involved in

various interactions with each other. Examining the income interaction, we find
that the largest proportional and absolute
effects occur at low levels of husband’s
income as wife’s income increases (Table
10). Indeed, the highest probability of
sterilization occurs when wife’s income is
approximately equal to husband’s income.
Thus, it appears that as wife’s income increases in proportion to total family income there is a strong incentive to opt for
sterilization, since a pregnancy in these
families would have a strong negative effect on family income should the wife not
continue to work outside the home.

The second interaction discovered occurs between wife’s income and the number of births to avert (Table 11). The greatest effect in this case occurs along the
diagonal from low income and few births
to avert to high income and a large number of births to avert. If births to avert is
an indicator of the benefits from an effective contraception scheme and wife’s income is at least partially an indicator of
the costs of an additional child, then the

to be the situation in which sterilization is
most likely to be chosen.

The remaining interaction occurs between the number of births to avert and
the number of children in the family (Table 12). In this case, a positive interaction
was found. Thus, the greatest effect occurs along the diagonal from lowest values
for both variables to highest values for
both variables. Consequently, those families with a large number of children as well
as a large number of births to avert are
most likely to opt for sterilization. Therefore, this interaction may be indicating an
intensity of need-for-family-limitation effect, a result similar to that found by
Kahley and Gillaspy (1977).

SUMMARY

A number of methods of contraception
are utilized in the United States by those
wishing to limit family size. This paper
focuses on the characteristics which differ

entiate among adopters of the various
methods available.

Employing a subsample from the 1970
National Fertility Survey, discriminant
analysis is used in an attempt to identify
the important characteristics of adopters
of methods, including sterilization, rhythm, foams, condoms, diaphragm, oral
pill, and IUD. The analysis was divided
into two parts: (1) the choice from among
the six methods usually thought of as contraceptives; and (2) the choice between
sterilization and the six methods.

With respect to the choice from among
six methods, a model including five average effects and two interaction effects
was tested. Two significant functions
were derived, indicating the presence of
two important characteristic dimensions.
The first dimension was concluded to
represent a traditional-methods versus
nontraditional-methods dimension, approximately along the lines of moreeffective versus less-effective strategies of
family limitation. The second characteristic dimension was concluded to represent
an aesthetics-health dimension, dividing
the methods primarily between coitusrelated versus not-coitus-related methods.

Contraceptive Choice

79

With respect to the choice between
sterilization and the other six methods, a
model including six average effects and
three interaction effects was tested. In the
previous analysis, the most important discriminating variables were the education
and religion variables. In this case, however, the income variables assume primacy. For example, the likelihood of
selecting sterilization increases markedly
as wife’s income increases proportionately
to husband’s income.

While the results reported are limited in
scope, they are encouraging. Additional
research, including a broader cross-section
of respondents and, if possible, an examination of the effects of the introduction of
a new method, would be of interest. With
such additional research, it would be possible to gain important knowledge about
the nature of the choice of family-planning
strategies.
