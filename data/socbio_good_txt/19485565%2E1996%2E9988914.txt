ABSTRACT: From information on mortality of Jews obtained from individual death certificates
and population data from surveys of the Jewish population undertaken in 1963 and 1987,
age-specific death rates and life expectancy of the Jewish population of Rhode Island are
compared with those of the total white population for 1963 and 1987 to assess changing
differentials. The Jewish mortality experience continues to differ from that of the larger population even while both groups have experienced noticeable improvements. For males, the age
standardized rates have widened in favor of Jews as have the life expectancies at birth and the
percentage surviving to old age. By contrast, for females, the standardized death rate has
widened considerably in favor of whites, while life expectancy has improved almost identically
for both groups and therefore remained about equal, as it was in 1963. Reasons for these patterns
are explored through attention to differences between Jews and the general white population in
death rates at particular stages of the life cycle. Jews tend to be more advantaged at all but the
most advanced ages, age groups in which proportionally more of the Jewish population and
Jewish deaths are concentrated.

with higher or lower survival rates,
religious differentials in mortality become an important perspective for
understanding changes in mortality
levels and life expectancy in the larger
society. This report, based on data for
a single state, Rhode Island, explores
the patterns of Jewish mortality and
survival during 1985-89, the ways
these differ from those of the general
white population, and the ways these
differences have changed in the quarter century since 1962-64 when a similar assessment (Goldstein, 1966) was
undertaken for approximately the
same area, using the same types of
data.

The observances of health measures
and cleanliness prescribed by traditional Judaism (Fishberg, 1911), coupled with the higher-than-average
socioeconomic status of the Jewish
population (Goldstein, 1992) would
lead one to expect the Jewish group to
have lower mortality rates and longer
survival than the general population.
However, such an hypothesized differential may be mitigated, if not totally
eliminated, as a result of both the general improvement in health standards
and a rise in the socioeconomic status
of the population at large. By comparing the mortality experience of the
Jewish and the total white populations
and assessing change in this relation
over approximately 25 years, this analysis is designed to gain insights into the
extent to which the religious dimension
constitutes an important variable in
mortality differentials in America as
we approach the end of the twentieth
century.

For reasons cited above, any comprehensive analysis of mortality must
begin with records that provide the

Jewish Mortality 73

maximum opportunity for identifying
all deceased regardless of their household or family status at the time of
death. Official death certificates provide the best means for doing so. However, because vital statistics records do
not contain information on religion, indirect information that provides clues
to the religious identification of the
deceased must be used before death
certificate information can be used for
the analysis of religious differentials
in mortality. And even if such indirect
data prove useful in identifying the
religion of the deceased, the need for
calculating death rates and survival
functions raises the challenges of identifying the appropriate population at
risk.

Among the clues that have been
used to identify the religion of the deceased are the place of burial of the deceased and the particular funeral establishment that handled the funeral. The
value of these particular sources of information probably varies by religious
identity, largely reflecting the different
practices with respect to burial in cemeteries identified as Jewish, Catholic,
Protestant, or nonsectarian. A similar
concern extends to whether funerals
are largely handled by funeral directors
of the same religious denomination as
the deceased. For Jews, the evidence
seems strong that this is the case.

PAST STUDIES OF JEWISH
MORTALITY

Studies undertaken of Jewish deaths
in New York City during 1949-51 (Seidman et al., 1962) and in St. Louis during 1955-57 (Gorwitz, 1962) indicated,
for example, that a very large proportion of Jewish funerals were handled

74 Goldstein

by a restricted number of funeral directors and that most Jewish burials
took place in a Jewish cemetery. Nonetheless, problems in using burial site as
the basis for identifying religion of deceased exist. In New York, 20 per cent
of the total New York deaths had to be
regarded as of unspecified religion because the bodies were either cremated,
interred out of town, or buried in the
city cemetery. Random assignment of
religion in the same proportion as deceased with known religion weakens
the value of the data for purposes of a
study of religious differentials in mortality. The use by the St. Louis study of
information on both the funeral director and the place of burial enhanced
the likelihood that the resulting statistics correctly reflected total Jewish
deaths.

Nonetheless, in both New York and
St. Louis, the absence of information
on the Jewish population among whom
the deaths occurred and especially on
its age/sex composition seriously limited the usefulness of the data on
deaths for calculating death and survival rates. Since age composition in
particular is a major variable in accounting for differentials in overall levels of mortality, information on agespecific death rates is essential if the
mortality experience of the Jewish and
non-Jewish populations are to be compared.

Within these data limitations, the
St. Louis study (Gorwitz, 1962), relying on estimates of the size of the total
Jewish population, found that the Jewish mortality rate was approximately 14
per cent lower than that of the resident
white population of the area. A much
higher percentage of Jewish deaths
than of white deaths were concentrated

 

Social Biology

between ages 45 and 85, but this finding may have reflected nothing more
than differences in age composition of
the two populations. In the absence of
proper data on the base population, no
definitive conclusions about differentials in risk of mortality were feasible.

The New York study (Seidman et
al., 1962) tried to overcome some of
the limitations of the St. Louis study by
using least squares method to estimate
the Jewish and non-Jewish white populations and death rates by age, sex,
and socioeconomic class. It found that
the male Jewish death rate was 14 per
cent below that of non-Jewish white
males whereas the Jewish female rate
was 4 per cent greater than that of nonJewish white females. It also found
that the Jewish death rates were much
lower for Jewish than for non-Jewish
persons in the same age, sex, and socioeconomic class in the younger age
groups, but that this advantage diminished and was even reversed in certain
of the older groups. Within the Jewish
group itself, the death rates of those in
the upper and middle socioeconomic
groups were lower than those in the
low socioeconomic class. Although direct comparison of the St. Louis and
New York findings is not possible, in
general, the conclusions pointed in
the same direction, that is, an overall
lower mortality for Jews.

Such a conclusion supports an earlier finding of Mortimer Spiegelman
(1948), based on Canadian data which,
unlike the United States, provided information on religion from both the
census and vital statistics. For 1940-42,
Spiegelman found that the life expectancy of Jews exceeded that of the general population by 4.6 years for males
and 3.6 years for females. Like the

Vol. 43, No. 1-2

later New York study, the Canadian investigation also found that the differentials favoring the Jews decreased
with advancing age; life expectancy of
Jewish males and of the total Canadian
population became equal at about age
25 and that of females at about age 35.
Beyond age 50, Jews began to be characterized by higher mortality rates.
Without further controls for differences in place of residence, socioeconomic status, nativity, and marital status, as well as cause of death, the exact
reason for the observed differences between Jews and non-Jews cannot be
definitively explained.

The limitations inherent in the small
number of studies conducted in the
1940’s and 1950’s stimulated the author
to take advantage of a unique combination of data for Providence, Rhode
Island, to undertake an assessment of
Jewish mortality and survival patterns
in the period 1962-64 (Goldstein,
1966). A population survey, completed
for the Jewish population of Greater
Providence in 1963, encompassed the
cities of Providence and Pawtucket and
nearby suburban areas (for details, see
Goldstein, 1964). Based on an updated
master list of Jewish residents of the
area, evaluated to be about 97 per cent
complete, a 25 per cent sample of the
all Jewish households in the community was surveyed, yielding 1,420 completed interviews, representing a response rate of 91.3 per cent. The
completed sample was weighted to represent the full universe of Jews residing
in the Greater Providence area. Since
the survey collected information on
age and sex of all household members,
it yielded for 1963 information on the
base population, categorized by age
and sex, at risk of dying in and around

1963. The challenge was to identify the
deaths occurring to this population.

The Jewish community of Greater
Providence was so structured that almost all deaths occurring to Jews were
handled by a single funeral director.
Moreover, practically all Jewish deceased were buried in the two cemeteries serving the area encompassed by
the study. Finally, even the very small
number of Jewish deceased who were
cremated or buried in other cemeteries
were generally serviced through the
one Jewish funeral home that existed at
the time. All of the available evidence
indicated that reliance on the records of
the Jewish funeral establishment provided virtually 100 per cent coverage
for all deaths occurring among Jews residing in Greater Providence, even if
their deaths occurred elsewhere.

For purposes of the mortality study,
the list of names of all deceased for the
period August 1, 1962 through July 31,
1964, a period centered on the months
during which the population survey
was completed, was obtained from the
funeral establishment. Each name on
this list was, in turn, checked in the
files of the Rhode Island Division of
Vital Statistics. After matching with
the original death certificate, information on age, sex, and cause of death
was abstracted. In conjunction with the
age/sex data from the sample survey,
this information from the vital records
provided the basis for calculating age/
sex specific death rates, for constructing life tables, and for assessing cause
of death. Comparable statistics and life
tables available for the mortality experience during 1959-61 of the general
population allowed comparative assessment of the mortality patterns of
Jews and the total white population of

Rhode Island. Integrated use of the
population survey statistics and the
data on Jewish mortality in Greater
Providence thus overcame the major
limitations inherent in earlier efforts to
assess Jewish mortality. Since the data
of the 1962-64 Providence study will
be used in conjunction with later evaluation of Jewish mortality patterns in
Rhode Island in 1985~—89 to assess
changes over the intervening quarter
century, the findings of the 1962-64
study will not be reviewed at this point.

Between the 1962-64 analysis and
this analysis of the 1985-89 mortality
patterns of Rhode Island Jewry, Alice
Goldstein (1986) analyzed the causes
of death among Rhode Island Jews
in 1979-81. Deaths were identified
through a combination of obituary listings in the local Jewish press and listings provided by local institutions, such
as funeral homes and synagogues. The
735 deaths occurring in the three-year
period were matched with death certificates to obtain information on the
characteristics of the deceased and
their cause of death. The absence of information on the population at risk
precluded calculation of either age/sex
specific death rates or life tables. The
findings indicated that relatively fewer
Jewish males died at ages below 65
and more at ages 85 and over than was
true of total white males. On the other
hand, Jewish females exhibited an ageat-death pattern more similar to white
females. The absence of information
on the age structure of the Jewish population precluded determination of
whether these patterns reflected actual
differences in mortality experience or
differences attributable to variations in
the age composition of the respective
populations.

Social Biology

Several studies of Jewish mortality
undertaken in other settings and using
other types of data warrant brief
attention. Again taking advantage of
questions on religion in the Canadian
census and vital statistics, Lionel
Needleman (1988) calculated a series
of life tables for the Jewish population
of the city of Montreal centered on the
census years of 1921, 1931, 1941, 1951,
1961, and 1971. These successive life
tables allowed evaluation of both
trends in Jewish mortality experience
over fifty years and changes in patterns
of differentials between Jews and
the Canadian population as a whole.
Needleman’s analysis showed that for
the first thirty years of the period, very
low mortality characterized the Jewish
population up to early middle age and
relatively high mortality thereafter. By
the end of the 1960’s, however, the
“Jewish” pattern of mortality had disappeared. The expectation of life of
female Jews was similar to that of all
Canadian women, but that of males
was higher than that of Canadian men.

Unfortunately, the continuing unavailability of comparable official data
sources for the United States means
that one has to rely on alternative data
sets to identify Jewish deaths and the
population at risk. Rosenwaike and
Hempstead (1989; 1990) evaluated differential mortality among foreign-born
Irish, Italians, and Jews in New York
City during 1979-81, focusing largely
on mortality by cause among deaths to
persons age 45-84. For the Irish and
Italians, age specific rates could be calculated using ethnicity data on the
death certificate and census data on the
foreign-born. In the absence of information on religion in both data sets, for
Jews the investigators had to rely on

Vol. 43, No. 1~2

religious denomination of cemetery of
burial to identify the religion of the deceased and on proportional mortality
analysis in lieu of information on the
base Jewish population. The latter involved comparisons of deaths among
the Jewish population with that of a
standard population to ascertain excesses and deficits of death by cause.
The results suggest that the Jewish and
Italian groups have cause-of-death distributions relatively similar to each
other but dissimilar from the Irish, reflecting the impact of alcoho] relateddeaths among the Irish.

Rosenwaike’s interest in the mortality of Jews led to a very innovative
analysis, also for 1979-81, but focusing
exclusively on elderly Jews. Intrigued
by the evidence from earlier studies of
lower than average Jewish mortality
levels at younger ages and higher averages at older ages, and challenged by
the absence of direct data on Jewish
deaths and on the population at risk,
Rosenwaike (1990) used 22 distinctive
Jewish names to identify 117,163 Medicare enrollees on April 1, 1980 as likely
to be Jewish. These names constituted
the base population. He then used
these same surnames to identify 17,819
Jewish deaths during 1979-81. The resulting age-specific rates among the 65year-and-over enrollees in Medicare
showed that Jewish men had substantially lower death rates than those for
all whites at ages 65-69, but the differential diminished with each advance in
age until by age 85 and over the mortality of the Jewish males exceeded
that of the whites. For women, he
found that the advantage of Jews over
whites was substantial among the
younger elderly and disappeared after
age-group 75-79. Although limited to

 

Jewish Mortality 77

mortality among the aged, these findings are important since a vast majority
of all deaths occurs among those 65
years and over (for example, in Rhode
Island about 80 per cent for males and
85 per cent for females). Nonetheless,
one would prefer to have data that encompass the entire age range.
Rosenwaike (1994) also used the national rates calculated for American
Jews on the basis of the Medicare
records to evaluate causes of death
among New York City’s Jewish elderly
in 1979-81. In the absence of access to
base population data for New York
City’s Jews, he applied the age/sexspecific death rates calculated for all
American Jews to data on cause of
death obtained from 36,303 certificates
of deceased buried in Jewish cemeteries in the three years centered on 1980.
The rate for each cause was ascertained by the percentage of deaths due
to the cause in each age/sex category.
The resulting estimates of causespecific rates were found to be consistent with data from previous studies.
The need to improvise in obtaining
cause-specific rates and age/sex specific
rates in this and other studies of Jewish
mortality in the United States highlights the desirability of utilizing a firm
population base for measuring the risk
of dying and for being able to do so for
the full population rather than just the
elderly. Such an opportunity to do so,
paralleling the use of the 1963 population survey of the Jewish population
of Greater Providence, emerged with
the completion of a second survey of
Rhode Island Jewry in 1987. The data
from that survey, used in conjunction
with information on Jewish deaths,
forms the basis for this research. In using these data, comparisons with the

patterns observed for 1962-64 allow
assessment of both changes in the Jewish mortality experience over a quarter
century and how similar these changes
were to those in the white population
of the state.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
DaTA SOURCES

The Jewish Federation of Rhode
Island undertook a second survey of
the Jewish population in 1987 (Goldscheider and Goldstein, 1988). While
the 1963 survey was restricted to
Greater Providence, the 1987 survey
encompassed the entire state of Rhode
Island, reflecting the residential dispersion of Rhode Island Jewry into
the outer suburbs and southern parts
of the state. In 1987, approximately
three-quarters of the sample households were selected through a random
sample chosen from the lists of the
Jewish Federation of Rhode Island,
which after updating, contained approximately 6,600 households. The remaining one-quarter came from a sample generated by random digit dialing
(RDD) of all households with telephones in Rhode Island. In total,
18,000 households in the state were
contacted and screened to identify
those households containing Jewish
members which would serve to supplement the sample from the Federation
list. About 91 per cent of the RDD
sample was on the Federation list, attesting to its higher level of completeness. For the 9 per cent who were not
on the list, the RDD sample served to
ensure coverage of Jewish households
more marginal to the organized community.

 

Social Biology

In each household in both the list
and the RDD samples, one person who
was aged 21 and over (or aged 18 to 20
if no member of the household was 21
or older) was randomly selected to be
the respondent, providing information
about himself/herself and about all
members of the household. A total of
1,455 households were contacted for
interviews and 1,129 completed interviews were obtained, a response rate of
78 per cent. These data were weighted
to approximate the total Jewish population of Rhode Island. The weighted
data, representing 15,520 persons
identified as Jewish at the time of the
survey, are used in this analysis to provide statistics on the base Jewish population subject to the risk of dying
around 1987. The availability from the
survey of information on the age and
sex of each household member allows
subdivision of the total population into
appropriate age/sex categories for purposes of calculating age/sex specific
death rates and life table survival functions.

The 1963 and 1987 surveys covered
different areas, the latter encompassing the entire state and the former only
Greater Providence. This difference
introduces some noncomparability between the two data sets, but not any
that seriously interferes with their joint
use to assess changes over the intervening quarter century. First, there is considerable overlap in coverage; 89 per
cent of the 1987 population lived in the
area covered by the 1963 survey. Second, there is no reason to believe that
the socioeconomic characteristics of
the 11 per cent residing in the outer areas in 1987 are substantially different
from the population covered in 1963
since the earlier sample did encompass

Vol. 43, No. 1-2

suburban areas also. Third, since virtually all of the analyses control for age
and sex, comparisons between the two
data sets are not seriously affected by
differences in age/sex composition of
the broader areal coverage in 1987.

As in 1962-64, the information on
deaths was obtained from the funeral
homes that service the vast majority of
the state’s Jewish community; by 1987
two such establishments existed. As
part of a larger project focussing on an
assessment of where deaths occurred
(home, hospital, Jewish Home for the
Aged, or nursing home), a complete
list of deaths of Jewish residents of
Rhode Island, covering the period
1953-89, was obtained from the two
Jewish funeral homes. A very small
number of deaths occurring to residents in the southern part of the state,
probably no more than 10 per year,
were not covered, but their omission is
not considered serious. All of the available evidence suggests that reliance
upon the records of the two funeral
homes provides close to 100 per cent
coverage for all Jewish deaths which
occurred in the state.

For each deceased, information was
abstracted from the death certificates
on name, year of birth (age), sex, marital status, occupation, place of birth,
residence at time of death, and place of
death. This analysis uses the information on the age and sex characteristics
of those who died during 1985-89,
which is centered on the 1987 survey,
to obtain age/sex specific death rates
and to use these to construct life tables
of the Rhode Island Jewish population.
The five-year interval is used to increase the number of cases and thereby
insure greater stability of the rates, especially because in younger years the

 

Jewish Mortality 719

number of Jewish deaths is very small.
A total of 1,170 deaths were enumerated for the five-year period, 556 males
and 614 females. In calculating rates, a
five-year average was employed.

To permit comparison with the mortality experience of the general population, the age and sex specific death
rates and life tables for the white population of the state in 1989-91 are
used. The absence of census data on
the state’s population by age, sex, and
race for 1987 precluded calculation of
rates for the same year as the survey
was taken. The age specific death rates
and life tables for 1989-91 were constructed using data on age/sex/race
specific deaths from state vital statistics
tabulations for 1989, 1990, and 1991
and the 1990 white population by age
and sex enumerated by the 1990 federal census. Use of the 1989-91 data
for whites means that their death rates
may be somewhat lower and their life
expectancy somewhat higher than if
the 1987 rates had been available because of improvements in mortality
that occurred during 1988-91. The difference between 1987 and 1989-91
rates are not, however, likely to be
large; between 1980 and 1990 the life
expectancy at birth of white Rhode Island males increased by only 0.6 years
and that of females by only 1.3 years,
or an annual average of only 0.06 and
0.13 years respectively. This finding
suggests that in 1987, compared to the
1989-91 life tables being used for comparative purposes, the life expectancy
of white females was at most half a year
lower and even less so for males. This
small differential minimizes the need
for concern about the use of the later
life table values for whites in the comparative evaluation with Jews in 1987.

RESULTS

Between 1963 and 1987 the Rhode
Island Jewish population had aged
considerably as a result of age-selective
out-migration and low fertility. In
1963, the median age of Jewish males
was 34.4 years and that of females 37.4
years; by 1987, the median ages of
males and females were 44.5 and 47.8
years respectively, an increase of about
10 years over the 25-year period (Table
1). During approximately this same interval, the state’s white population had
also aged, but not as sharply as did the
Jews; the male median rose from 29.2
to 33.4 years and the female median
from 34.7 to 36.7 years. Higher outmigration of younger Jews, associated
with the very high proportion who
leave the state to obtain a college/
university education and then remain
outside the state to pursue a career,
coupled with lower Jewish than white
fertility accounts for the differences.
These factors are evidenced in the age
distribution data which show fewer
Jews in ages 0-14 and especially in ages
15-34, which encompass the college/
university years and periods associated
with beginning a career. By contrast, in
1987, 23 per cent of Jewish males and
26 per cent of all Jewish females were
age 65 and over, compared to only 13
per cent of white males and 19 per
cent of white females in 1990. The differences in age composition argue
strongly for control for age in any comparisons, both over time and between
the Jewish and the white populations.

In 1963, the crude death rate among
Jewish males was 10.6 per 1,000 population, slightly below the white male
rate of 11.3 (Table 2). Once age was
controlled, however, through age stan
 

Social Biology

dardization,! the Jewish rate rose to
11.0, still below but closer to that of
whites, suggesting that about half the
0.7 difference in crude rates was attributable to age composition and that
overall Jewish and white male mortality experience varied minimally. For
females, the pattern was quite different. The 9.7 per 1,000 crude death rate
of Jewish females was slightly higher
than the 9.4 rate for white females, but
standardization raised the Jewish rate
to 11.2, accentuating the Jewish-white
difference.

For 1987, quite a different set of
relations emerges. The crude Jewish
male rate of 15.0 is almost 50 per cent
greater than that of the white males at
10.2. However, this differential is attributable to the much older age composition of Jewish males (an average of
11 years). With age controlled, the low
Jewish death rate of 8.6 per 1,000 is
only 82 per cent as high as the white
male rate, suggesting that over the
quarter century Jewish mortality improved to a much greater extent than
did white mortality generally. The Jewish female crude rate was quite similar
to that of the Jewish males, while that
of white females was slightly lower
than the rate for white males. Control
for age reduces the Jewish female rate,
bringing it down to 12.2 per 1,000,
compared to the 9.8 rate for white
females, but this is still a 25 per cent
excess for the Jewish families.

Compared to 1963, when Jewish female mortality exceeded that of white

source of variation among groups due to differences
in age composition. It indicates what the Jewish

and 179~180).

females by 19 per cent with age controlled, the 1987 rate points, unlike the
changes for males, to lesser improvement in Jewish female mortality than
in that of white females. Clearly, in
1987, as in 1963, Jewish-white differentials adhere to a different pattern
for males and females. Whereas Jewish
men, with age controlled, had much
lower mortality than white men
generally, the disadvantage of Jewish
women continued, and even increased.

Whether this deterioration for females
characterized all ages or only selected
ones must be examined.

In 1963, for both sexes the age specific rates at early ages were lower
for Jews than for the total population.
For males this differential continued
through ages 55-64 and for females,
with one minor exception, through
ages 45-54. Thereafter, the Jewish
rates were higher and the difference
tended to become greater with rising

may explain the lower rates at earlier
ages. As a result, more Jews survived
to old age, as later attention to life
expectancy will show, but in the older
ages chronic conditions assumed
greater importance and accounted for
the higher rates among Jews. As
Spiegelman (1948) long ago suggested,
the higher death rates of Jews in older
ages, also noted in many of the studies
cited earlier, too, may arise from their
lower mortality in early life. Propor

tionally more physically impaired Jews
may live until the upper older ages
when the chronic conditions take a
heavier toll (Spiegelman, 1948, p. 300301).

By 1987, the pattern of differentials
seems to have changed. Except for infants for whom the Jewish rate was
slightly above that of white babies,
Jewish male mortality levels were below those of white males at all ages
through 75-84 years; the rate for this
group was 35 per cent greater among
whites than among Jewish males. Except for infants, only among those age
85 and over did the rate of Jewish male
deaths exceed that of all whites in the
same age group, and for this group it
did so by a wide margin, 57 per cent.
The much wider age range over which
lower Jewish male mortality extended
in 1987 helps explain the substantially
lower standardized rate for total Jewish males, 8.6 per 1,000 compared to
10.2 for white males.

Clearly, between 1963 and 1987, a
much greater improvement in survival
characterized the Jewish than the white
male segment of the population. For
example, for those age 65-74 and 7584, the 1987 Jewish death rate was less
than half that of Jewish males in these
age groups in 1963, whereas for white
males the decline was only 36 per cent
for those age 65~74 and 26 per cent for
the 75-84 year group. These differential rates of change in mortality may reflect variations in the socioeconomic
composition of the Jewish and the
white populations, leading to whites
having poorer access to health care and
survival experience, even though conditions for both have improved over
the several] decades covered by the
comparisons.

 

 

Jewish Mortality 83

Only in the very oldest group, those
age 85 and over, among whom Jewish
mortality far exceeded that of white
males, did the age-specific rates of the
Jews and the whites decline at approximately the same rate, 27 per cent for
the Jews and 24 per cent for the whites.
As recent research (Kannisto et al.,
1994) documenting substantial reductions in mortality at advanced ages in
developed countries suggests, since
half of female deaths and a third of
male deaths in such countries now occur at age 80 and above, mortality reductions in these older ages can signiftcantly affect life expectancy and the
proportion of aged in the population.
For Rhode Island Jews, the percentages were even higher, about 60 per
cent of all deaths of females and 45 per
cent of all male deaths occurred to persons age 80 and over, helping to explain the impact of deaths in old age on
the overall mortality levels of Jews.

For females, too, the age-specific
rates of Jews showed more dramatic
improvement than for whites and resulted in the Jewish rates being lower
than those of white females to older
ages than was true tn 1963. If one overlooks some inconsistencies within ages
1-34 where the death rates of both
Jewish and white females are very low
(under 1.0 per 1,000), the age-specific
rates of Jewish females in 1987 are below those of white females generally in
every age group through 65-74, 10
years earlier than for males but 20
years later than the point at which the
cross-over occurred in 1963 for females. Between ages 65 and 74, the difference is not great, though favoring
Jewish women. For those age 75-84,
Jewish mortality exceeds that of white
females by only 19 per cent, but for the

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

84 Goldstein

85 and over group the disadvantage
characterizing Jewish women increases
to 68 per cent.

For both Jewish and white females
above age 55, as for comparable age
groups of males, the improvements in
mortality were substantial. However,
the degree of change in relation to age
followed a different pattern for men
and women. The relative difference
between the 1963 and the 1987 rates
decreased with rising age for Jewish
women from a 64 per cent decline for
those age 55-64 to only a 28 per cent
decline for the oldest. For whites, the
decrease between 1960 and 1990 in the
death rates of those age 55-64 was only
26 per cent, but with successive age
groups this percentage rose, reaching a
45 per cent decline in the rate for those
age 75-84. For the oldest group, however, the rate of change was lower,
only 31 per cent. Reflecting these
different patterns of change, Jewish
women between ages 55-74 were characterized by greater improvement than
white women in these ages. By contrast, those age 75 and over experienced lower reductions than whites in
general. It is the more moderate decreases at ages 75 and over, where
most of the deaths occur, that accounts
for the higher age standardized rate of
Jewish mortality (12.2) compared to
white mortality (9.8) in 1987 and the
increase in the differential between the
two groups from 1.8 per 1,000 in 1963
to 2.4 per 1,000 in 1987.

What might explain the changing relation between Jewish and white agespecific rates and the greater improvement overall in male Jewish mortality
compared to that of white males, and
the different pattern for females?
Without fuller attention to the impact
on mortality of a host of other socio
 

Social Biology

economic characteristics, such as education, income, marital status, and use
of health facilities, one can only speculate. Part of the explanation may lie in
the change over the quarter century in
the nativity status of the Jewish and the
total white population. In 1963, 17 per
cent of all Jews in Greater Providence
were foreign-born. Associated with
this were higher proportions with
lower educational achievement and
lower occupational status, characteristics often associated with more limited
access to health facilities and poorer
overall health. The Jews in the early
1960’s were living under more favorable conditions than the general population, even though the latter had
fewer immigrants (10 per cent). In
ensuing decades, the reduction in
foreign-born was greater for the Jews,
about half, from 17 per cent in 1963 to
9 per cent in 1987, compared to a decline of only about one-third for
whites, from 10 per cent in 1960 to 7
per cent in 1990, reflecting the higher
rate of recent immigration for the
larger white community. The reductions in the proportion of immigrants
among the elderly was even greater,
from 73 per cent to 17 per cent for Jews
and from 41 to 11 per cent for whites,
but for both the total and the elderly
population, Jews continued to have
more immigrants.

Moreover, the rise of Jews in the educational and occupational hierarchy
was more substantial. In 1963, 41 per
cent of adult Jews had at least a college
education (48 per cent of men and 35
per cent of women); by 1987 this was
true of three-fourths of the adult Jewish population (79 per cent of men and
68 per cent of women). By contrast,
the proportion of adult whites with
some college education increased from
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 43, No. 1~2

only 13 per cent (15 per cent of men
and 11 per cent of women) to 40 per
cent (45 per cent of men and 37 per
cent of women). Although the improvement for both white men and
women by 1990 was relatively greater
than for Jews, the absolute changes
were less and brought each white gender group only slightly above the educational levels that had characterized
Jews in 1963.

As Rogot et al. (1988, Table 6) have
shown, higher education is a key variable associated with Jower mortality.
Using standard mortality ratios as a
measure of comparative mortality,
they found, for example, that in 197981 the expected mortality level of white
males age 55-64 with a 0-4 level of education was 31 per cent greater than
would be expected on the basis of all
white males in this age group; by contrast that of college educated males
ranged between 15 and 42 per cent
lower than expected, being greatest for
those with the most years of college
completed. The same pattern generally
held for women and for younger and
older groups of both sexes. As Kunst
and Mackenbach (1994) suggest,
higher death rates of lower educated
groups are explained at least in part by
a higher prevalence of risk factors for
disease, such as those related to lifestyles, material well-being, working
conditions, and ways of coping with
stress. They found that the effect of education on mortality is approximately
equally large in all nine industrialized
countries they compared.

Whatever factors underlay these educational differentials in the general
population may also help to explain the
differences between the mortality levels of Jewish males and the larger white
population and changes in these rela
Jewish Mortality 85

tions between 1963 and 1987 in Rhode
Island. They do not, however, offer a
full answer, as evidenced by the differential rates of improvement characterizing men and women.

Age could certainly be a factor. The
very oldest age groups contain the majority of immigrants, who generally
have less education. Moreover this age
group was not as affected by the sharp
increases in education between the
1960’s and late 1980’s as the younger
groups. It is among the groups under
age 75 that the female Jewish death
rates in 1985-89 are somewhat lower
than the white female rates in 1990. In
1963 they were lower only through
ages 45-54. The much higher average
educational levels of the Jewish women
by 1987, especially in younger age
groups (among those age 25-44, 84 per
cent had some college education and
for those age 45-64 about 72 per cent
did, compared to only 44 per cent
among those age 65 and over), may be
indicative of the changes in basic life
styles that led to the improvements
noted earlier.

That the high levels of educational
achievement among Jewish women are
not associated with substantially lower
mortality and better survival rates may
be because women do not benefit as
much from having a college and university education. Pappas et al. (1993),
for example, found in their assessment
of data from the 1986 National Mortality Followback Survey that the ageadjusted mortality ratio for white men
with less than a high-school education
was 2.5 times as great as for men with
four or more years of college. By contrast, the ratio for the less educated
women was 86 per cent. For men,
higher education evidently yields a
greater return, not only in earnings,

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

86 Goldstein

but also in style of life conducive to
greater longevity. If so, this may help
explain the wider differentials characterizing Jewish and white men compared to Jewish and white women.

In speculating about reasons for
these patterns, we must also consider
the possible role of selective out- and
in-migration, especially of older persons. It is quite possible, for example,
that Jewish retirees who move to the
Sunbelt are more robust than those
who stay behind to be cared for by relatives or friends or in nursing homes.
Compounding such health-related outmigration of the elderly may be selective return and in-migration. Once
confronted with health problems, especially after one spouse has died,
older out-migrants may return to origin
to be nearer relatives and friends who
can care for them as their health deteriorates. Aged parents of Rhode Island
residents may also move to the state,
even though they did not live in it previously, to spend their remaining years
close to their children. Together, these
selective movements—in, out, and
return—may inflate the death rates of
aged Jews and help explain the differentials between them and the white
elderly.

LiFE EXPECTANCY DIFFERENTIALS

Based on the age-specific death
rates calculated for the Jewish population for 1963 and 1987, life tables were
constructed to allow (1) evaluation of
changes in Jewish life expectancy at
different ages and (2) comparison of
the Jewish patterns of change with
those of the white population, using
1959-61 and 1989-91 life tables for the
latter (Table 3).

 

Social Biology

In 1963, the life expectancy at birth
of Jewish males, assuming continuation of the age-specific mortality characterizing the 1962-64 period, was 70.8
years. Reflecting their generally lower
death rates, females could expect to
live longer on average, to 73.4 years.
Compared to the life expectancies of
the white population, based on the
mortality experience during the
census-centered years 1959-61, Jewish
males on the average could expect to
live 3.3 years longer than males in the
white population. By contrast, the differential for females was minimal and
favored the white population; Jewish
female life expectancy was 0.2 years
lower than that of white females.
These differentials parallel the pattern
of differentials in age-specific death
rates by age noted earlier.

Jewish females, like white females
generally, enjoyed a longer life expectancy than did their male counterparts.
However, the differential between
men and women was greater for whites
than for the Jewish segment of the population, 6.1 years compared to only 2.6
years, largely reflecting the much
greater advantage in life expectancy
that Jewish males had over white
males.

By 1987, the life expectancy of Jews
had risen considerably over its level a
quarter century earlier. At birth, Jewish males could expect to live on average to 76.3 years and Jewish females to
79.3 years, gains of 5.5 and 5.9 years
respectively, or about 8 per cent. Between 1959-61 and 1989-91, the 30year period over which changes in
white life expectancy can be measured,
life expectancy also rose, to 73.0 years
for males and 79.8 years for females,
representing gains of 5.5 years and 6.2

males was equal to that for Jewish
males, but white females gained
slightly more than Jewish females. The
gains for whites would be somewhat
less if also measured over 24 years, as
is done for the Jews, instead of the 30
years for which life tables were available. Most noteworthy, however, is
that the lesser gain for Jewish females
than for white females generally resulted in a continuation in the comparative disadvantage of Jewish females.

0.2 years, increased slightly by 1987
to 0.5 years. By contrast, for Jewish
males, the 3.3 year advantage over
white males in the 1960s did not change
by the late 1980's.

In 1963, the more favorable life expectancy characterizing the Jewish
male population at birth persisted up
to age 65, although the balance in favor
of the Jews diminished with rising age.
For example, at age 25, Jewish males
could expect to live another 46.9 years,
1.8 years more than white males generally; by age 55 the 19.0 years remaining on average exceeded the expectancy of whites by only 0.6 years.
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

88 Goldstein

Beginning at age 65, white male expectancy was greater than that of Jewish males, and this advantage persisted
into the very aged years. In fact, by age
85, white males could expect to live 2.0
years beyond the 2.6 years expected by
Jewish males. The higher life expectancy of Jewish males at birth stems
from the more favorable age-specific
mortality patterns characterizing the
younger age groups of the Jewish population. The advantage was lost at
older ages due to their higher agespecific death rates at the later stages of
the life cycle.

For females the pattern for 1963 was
quite different. The slightly lower life
expectancy characterizing Jewish females at birth was paralleled by lower
life expectancy at all subsequent ages,
and the disadvantage increased. Until
age 35, the differential never exceeded
one year, but at age 35 it was 1.1 years
and with one exception it was greater
at older ages, peaking at a difference of
two years at age 85. Evidently the small
advantages Jewish females enjoyed in
age-specific mortality rates in most
young and middle age groups were not
great enough to offset the substantially
higher death rates, compared to
whites, that they experienced at 75 and
over. As a result, Jewish females had
lower life expectancy than white females at birth and throughout the life
cycle. The factors accounting for this
difference between Jewish males and
females can not be determined from
the data available for the 1962-64
deaths.

By 1987, the favorable life expectancy of Jewish males, in comparison
to white males, extended 20 years further into the life cycle than was true in
1963 up to age 85. At age 55, for ex
 

Social Biology

ample, the 24.1 years that Jewish males
could still expect to live exceeded the
expectancy of white males by 1.6 years
and at age 75 the differential still favored Jews, although down to only 0.2
years. Only at age 85 did the Jewish
male expectancy (3.6 years) go below
that of white males (5.7 years), about
equal in absolute terms to the 2.0 year
difference of 1963. Overall, however,
the data on life expectancy differentials
for the males support the earlier finding that by 1987, compared to 1963,
Jewish male survival had generally improved more than that of white males.

The lower 1963 life expectancy at
birth of Jewish females compared to
whites continued to 1987. Moreover,
as in 1963, this disadvantage continued
to hold for all ages. The comparative
differences for Jewish and white females in 1987 changed minimally for
younger groups. As in 1963, however,
the relative difference between Jews
and whites rose with increasing age
from age 15 on. Yet, in the 1980’s the
differences were less sharp for age
groups 5-74 than in the 1960’s, especially for those age 35-64. For those
age 75-84, however, the difference
was considerably greater, while minimum change characterized the difference for the oldest group. For example, at age 45, in the 1980’s life expectancies were 36.0 years for Jews
and 36.6 years for whites, more similar
than the 30.3 years and 31.7 years in
the 1960’s. Thereafter, the differential
between white and Jewish women increased with rising age; at age 75, Jewish women in 1987 could expect to live
10.2 more years, whereas white women
had an average expectancy of 12.5
years; this compared to expectancies of
8.0 and 9.0 respectively in the 1960's, a

difference considerably below that of
the 1980’s. At the oldest age, the comparative differences between 1963 and
1987 remained virtually unchanged, reflecting similar improvements for both
Jewish and white females.

Compared to the 1960’s, by the
1980’s the percentage difference between Jewish and white male life expectancies, in contrast to those of females, had changed far more at all ages
but the two oldest. The changes in life
expectancy at all ages from 1 through
55 years widened the favorable Jewish
male differential. For those age 75-84,
the change resulted in a switch from a
more favorable white life expectancy
to a more favorable Jewish one. At 85,
the change narrowed the continuing
advantage whites had. By contrast, the
changes for Jewish females compared
to white females narrowed their unfavorable differentials for ages 5 through
65, but widened the differences at
age 75 and resulted in little change at
age 85. Evidently, whatever socioeconomic, behavioral, and/or biological
factors were operating to improve the
survival potential of Jewish males over
this quarter century did not apply
equally to the female segment of the
Jewish population, especially not to
those age 75 and over.

SURVIVAL EXPERIENCE

Average life expectancy at birth or
at other specific ages reflects the mortality experience of the population
throughout all later stages of the life
cycle. A different perspective for evaluating the survival experience of the
populations under study, also based on
the life table, is to compare what proportion of the original birth cohort in

 

Jewish Mortality 89

the varied groups will still be alive by
any subsequent year of age.

The life tables constructed for the
Jewish population of Greater Providence, based on age-specific death
rates operating during 1962-64 showed
that, if those mortality rates persisted,
95.5 per cent of all Jewish males would
still be alive at age 45 compared to 92.4
per cent of all white males (Table 4).
Reflecting the lower death rates at
younger ages, by age 65, 76.8 per cent
of the Jewish males but only 66.4 per
cent of all white males in the original
cohorts would still be living. Thereafter, the differential first narrows and
then reverses itself; by age 85, only
10.1 per cent of the Jewish males but
18.2 per cent of all white males would
still be living.

Reflecting the reductions in agespecific mortality that characterized
the interval between the 1960’s and the
1980’s, the chances of surviving generally improved for both Jewish and
white males. Based on the survival values for the 1985-89 period, 96.1 per
cent of Jewish babies could expect to
live until age 45, and this was true of
93.7 per cent of all white births. The
comparatively small differential characterizing the two groups in the 1960’s
narrowed slightly, reflecting the small
changes in the already low death rates
characterizing most age groups under
age 45.

By age 65, however, the improvements in survival chances were
sharper, reflecting the much more substantial improvements in death rates
between ages 45 and 65 among both
Jews and whites generally. The survival rates of the 1980’s show that out
of the original cohorts, 84.1 per cent of
Jewish males and 76.7 per cent of all

white males would still be alive by age
65, well above the 76.8 per cent and
66.4 per cent characterizing these respective populations in the 1960’s. The
Jewish advantage persisted but narrowed.

The sharpest changes occurred
above age 65. For Jews the percentage
who could be expected to survive to
age 75 increased from 43.3 per cent to
64.8 per cent, and the improvement
was even sharper by age 85, at which
point just over one-third of the original
cohort could still be expected to be
alive. By contrast, the proportion of
whites surviving to age 75 would be

only 54.7, well above the 38.8 level
of the 1960’s but substantially below
the Jewish proportion. The differential
was even more striking at age 85 when
the proportion of whites still alive was
only 23.3, somewhat above what it was
in the 1960’s but far below the 35.1 per
cent of Jews surviving to this age.
Clearly then, compared to white males
generally, the chances of male Jews
surviving to older ages, improved more
impressively in the quarter century
between 1962-63 and 1985-89.

Based on the 1962-64 age-specific
mortality rates, more Jewish females
(96.9 per cent) than white females

Vol. 43, No. 1-2

(94.8 per cent) were expected to survive to age 45. This differential was
even smaller than for males. By age 65,
again more Jewish than white females
were expected to be still alive, but for
females the differential, 1.8 percentage
points, was minimal compared to the
10.4 percentage points favoring Jewish
males at this age. Beyond age 65,
higher proportions of white women
than of Jewish women expected to survive; 23.7 per cent of all whites were
expected to be still alive at age 85 compared to 19.7 per cent of the Jewish
women.

How do the 1985-89 patterns of survival for females compare with those of
1962-64? As for men, there was improvement in survival chances, but
most of the increase occurred in older
ages. By age 45, 97.2 per cent of the
Jewish female babies in the original
cohort would still be alive if 1985-89
age-specific mortality levels continued
throughout their lifetime, a survival
rate only slightly higher than the 96.9
per cent characterizing white females
as a whole. For Jews, the 1985~89 proportion surviving to age 45 represented
a very small increase over the 96.9 per
cent surviving to this age according to
the 1962—64 rates; for whites, the improvement was slightly greater, from
94.8 per cent to 96.6 per cent. By age
65, however, the survival chances of
both groups had improved substantially; 90.6 per cent of the Jewish females would still be alive compared to
82.2 per cent in the 1960’s, and 86.2 per
cent of the white females would survive
to this age, compared to 80.4 per cent
some twenty years earlier. By this

older age the differential between the

Jewish and white survival rates had
widened over what it was in the 1960’s

 

 

Jewish Mortality 91

and also over what it was at age 45 in
both the 1960’s and the 1980's.

Above age 65, the relation between
female Jewish and white survival
chances changed substantially over the
period being compared, coming to
more closely resemble the differential
patterns characterizing males. Based
on the 1962-64 rates, Jewish females
had less chance of surviving to ages 75
and 85 than did white females. By the
1980’s, however, the Jewish female
survival rate to age 75, like that of the
Jewish males exceeded that of the
white females, although the difference
was not as sharp as for males. Just over
three-fourths of all Jewish females
would still be alive at age 75 compared
to 72.0 per cent of white females. By
age 85, however, the percentages were
down to 42.9 per cent and 44.7 per cent
respectively, very close but favoring
whites. This finding compares to a differential favoring Jewish men over
white men in the magnitude of 50 per
cent.

Noteworthy, too, is the very substantial improvements for both Jewish
and white females in chances of survival to the very oldest groups. Jewish
female survival chances to age 85 more
than doubled from 19.7 per cent to 42.9
per cent, whereas that of the whites,
while also rising substantially, increased less, from 23.7 per cent to 43.9
per cent. As a result of the sharper improvements in Jewish survival rates, in
the 1980’s a higher proportion of Jewish female babies than of whites could
expect to still be alive at all ages, except age 85, in contrast to the 1960’s
when the Jewish females lost their advantage by age 75.

As interesting as the differentials
between Jewish and white females are,
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

92 Goldstein

especially striking about these data is
the high proportion in both groups expected to survive late into the life cycle, if the age-specific death rates of the
early years of the 1980 decade persisted throughout the lifetime of babies
born in the 1960’s. That about 94 per
cent of the Jewish males and 95 per
cent of the Jewish females would still
be alive at age 55, and 65 per cent of
the men and 76 per cent of the women
at age 75 illustrates this point. While
differing some, the survival rates of
the total white group were equally impressive.

Moreover, as a result of their lower
age-specific death rates at all but a few
of the very youngest ages, a considerably higher proportion of females survive into old age than do males. By age
75, only 65 per cent of the Jewish males
were likely to still be living compared
to 76 per cent of the females, and by
age 85, some 43 per cent of the women
compared to 35 per cent of the men
would be alive. The sex selective mortality suggested by these hypothetical
statistics, based on mortality rates current in the late 1980's, correspond with
reality as reflected in the low sex ratios
among the aged population actually
enumerated in surveys and censuses.
Rhode Island in 1987, for example,
had only 75 Jewish men aged 75 and
over for every 100 Jewish women. The
sex ratio was even more unbalanced
for the aged white population; the 1990
census enumerated only 47 men for every 100 women among those age 75 and
over. The sharper difference for whites
than for Jews probably stems in large
measure from the lower survival rates
that white males, beginning at age 25,
have in comparison to white females;
those of Jewish men and women are

 

Social Biology

much closer to each other. This difference is already reflected in the fairly
substantial difference in sex ratio characterizing those age 65-74; there were
88 Jewish men for every 100 Jewish
women, but only 76 men for every 100
women among the larger white population.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

This research has asked whether religious identity and, in particular, being Jewish is associated with different
patterns of mortality as indexed by
age-specific death rates and life expectancy. Without adequate information
to measure the direct impact of particular religious practices and customs on
health status and survival levels, any
attempt to assess the effect of religious
identity on mortality level must be indirect. The results can therefore be little more than suggestive, especially if
the available data do not allow full control for such key variables affecting life
chances as education, occupation, and
income. Yet, documentation of differences in mortality experience between
religious groups can suggest whether
differential life styles or possibly even
genetic factors (when the group has
been characterized by high degrees of
homogamous marriage) associated
with particular religious groups may
help to account for their life chances.

To explore this question, mortality
data available for the Jewish population of Rhode Island in the period centering on 1987 have been compared
with those of the state’s total white
population. The assessment has been
enriched by comparisons with the early
1960’s, allowing attention to the extent
to which the patterns of differentials

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

Vol. 43, No. 1-2

changed during the quarter century.
For both periods, the absence of a
question on religious identity on the official death certificates and in the federal census required use of alternate
sources to obtain data on both Jewish
deaths and the Jewish base population
exposed to the risk of dying. Information from records maintained by funeral homes serving the Jewish community and from population surveys of
the Jewish community in 1963 and 1987
were used to fill the vacuum in official
data sources.

As a religion, Judaism stresses the
sanctity of the body and the need to
care for it. This view, as well as religious practices that required cleanliness, restricted the kinds of food eaten,
emphasized restraint in consumption
of alcoholic beverages, and prescribed
circumcision for males, could be hypothesized to lead to better health and
lower mortality among Jews. Concurrently, the high levels of education
characterizing the Jewish-American
population in recent decades, their
heavy concentration in upper whitecollar occupations and the resulting
higher-than-average income levels,
their spatial concentration in metropolitan areas with relatively easy access
to health facilities, and their clustering
in better residential areas might all
be expected to reenforce the religious
values that favored good health and
long life.

Yet, differentials in diet, in stress
conditions associated with educational
and occupational competition, and
with minority status may counteract
some of the benefits emanating from
the positive factors. Moreover, none of
these factors, positive or negative, are
constant. Weakening of traditional re
Jewish Mortality 93

ligious values and practices, greater acculturation into the larger society, and
high rates of intermarriage could all result in a narrowing of attitudinal and
behavioral differentials between Jewish Americans and other Americans.
Concurrently, higher educational and
occupational achievement by non-Jews
as well as social reforms that provided
wider access to health facilities may result in less distinctive patterns of Jewish mortality. Together, these considerations have led to the hypothesis that
over time the pattern of differentials
observed in the early 1960’s will have
become less marked by the end of the
1980’s. |
The analysis for 1963 showed that,
with differences in age composition
controlled, the mortality of Jewish
males differed minimally from that of
white males while that of Jewish females was higher than that of white
females generally. Based on this comparison, therefore, the findings did not
support the original hypothesis. However, attention to the age-specific data
showed that for both males and females Jewish mortality was below that
of the white population at younger
ages and only surpassed it in older
groups. The explanations offered for
the survival advantage characterizing
younger Jews lay in the socioeconomic
and religious factors favoring good
health mentioned earlier. The reversal
at older ages was speculated to be due
to the greater susceptibility of older
Jews, who having benefited from the
conditions favoring good health in
younger ages and survived to old age,
to be exposed to chronic conditions
which then took a higher toll among
them. That chronic diseases accounted
for comparatively more deaths among
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

94 Goldstein

older Jews than whites generally supported such a thesis.

Comparison of life expectancy at
various stages of the life cycle showed
average life expectancy at birth to favor Jewish males, but to vary minimally for females. The advantage in
life expectancy of Jewish males declined, however, with advancing age
and was actually lost beginning at age
65. Among females, Jewish life expectancy remained below that of whites
at all ages, and the differential became
increasingly higher from middle age
onward.

The Rhode Island analysis, like several earlier studies of other communities showed that Jewish mortality and
survival patterns differed from those of
the general white population. Continuing assessment was clearly necessary of
the relation between religious identity
and mortality. The analysis using the
1987 survey of the Rhode Island Jewish
population in conjunction with death
records for 1985-89 allows such a
follow-up evaluation.

In the interval between 1963 and
1987, the Jewish population of Rhode
Island had aged markedly, more so
than the general population. The sharp
rise in the proportion of Jewish aged
resulted from a combination of selective out-migration of younger persons,
low Jewish fertility, and more persons
living to older ages. One consequence
was that in the 1980’s, far more of the
Jewish deaths occurred among the
aged, 88 per cent among those age 65
and over and 68 per cent among those
age 75 and over, than was true in the
early 1960’s when only 71 per cent of
all deaths involved persons age 65 and
over and 36 per cent those age 75 and
over. This finding means that whatever

 

 

Social Biology

overall differentials characterized the
Jewish and the larger white population
in the late 1980’s very largely reflected
differentials in the aged population. It
explains why the Jewish crude death
rates for both males and females in
1987 were far above those of the comparable white groups, and why the differential narrowed considerably once
compositional differences in age were
controlled.

With age controlled, Jewish male
mortality was, in fact, 16 per cent lower
than that of whites compared to near
equality in 1963. Jewish female mortality, by contrast, remained much
greater than that of white females,
more so even than in 1963. As in the
1960’s, the factors affecting Jewish
male and female mortality in comparison to white mortality continued to
vary.

Consistent also with the 1960’s patterns, age-specific death rates for Jews,
both male and female, were with a
few small exceptions for females, lower
than those of whites at young and middie ages. Contrary to expectation, the
advantage in the 1980’s extended
higher into the age hierarchy, and for
men includes all but those age 85 and
over. This finding suggests that factors
accounting for more favorable life
chances among the younger segments
of the Jewish population compared to
whites 25 years earlier may now be affecting the older groups as well, even
while improvements also occurred
among whites.

Jews and whites also experienced
quite similar improvements in their
average life expectancies at birth,
about 8 per cent. The magnitude of
gains made by Jewish males, however,
were greater at older ages, and as a re
 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

Vol. 43, No. 1-2

sult extended the Jewish advantage in
life expectancy further into the life cycle; only at age 85 and over could white
males expect to live more years than
Jewish males of comparable age. By
contrast, in the late 1980’s, as in the
early 1960’s, white women had an advantage over Jewish females in life expectancy at all ages. Males and females
thus continued to vary considerably in
extent of differences between Jews and
whites generally as well as in the patterns of change since 1963.

This is reflected, too, in the proportions surviving to given ages under the
mortality schedules operating in each
period. Proportionally more Jews and
whites could expect to live to older
ages under the more recent regimen of
death rates. However, the improvements were greater for Jewish men and
women. Only at age 85, did Jewish
women have a lower number surviving
than did whites, and the differential
was both minimal and below that of
1963 when Jewish women as well as
Jewish men had considerably fewer
survivors out of the original birth cohort than did whites.

Overall, therefore, the Jewish mortality experience continues to differ
from that of the larger population’s
even while both groups have experienced noticeable improvements in
the quarter century under observation.
Whether the earlier differentials have
narrowed or widened depends on the
index used. For males, the age
standardized rates have widened in favor of Jews as have the percentage surviving to old age. By contrast, for
females, the standardized death rate
has widened considerably in favor of
whites, while life expectancy at birth
has improved quite similarly for both

Jewish Mortality 95

groups and therefore remained about
equal, as it was in 1963. On the other
hand, from being disadvantaged in the
proportion surviving to age 75 in 1963,
more Jewish women than white women
in 1987 could expect to survive to age
75. By age 85, however, the proportions were virtually identical at 43-45
per cent, but this represented a considerable improvement for Jewish women
over the situation in 1963.

The mixed signals given by the different indicators reflect, in part, their
varying sensitivity to the death rates
operating at different stages of the life
cycle and the fact that, judged by agespecific rates, Jews are favored at all
but the most aged groups. In these age
groups proportionally more of the Jewish population and of Jewish deaths are
concentrated. In 1987, the fact that the
male Jewish death rate exceeds that of
whites only in the 85-and-over age
group, whereas it did so in the three
oldest groups in 1963, contributes to
widening the standardized rates for
males in favor of Jews. For the females, the higher age-specific mortality
of Jews than of whites in the two oldest
groups, more so for those age 75-84,
than in 1963, helps to explain the widening of the rates for women which favored whites.

Life expectancy at birth reflects
mortality experience at all later ages
and therefore incorporates the effects
both of the lower age-specific Jewish
rates at earlier ages and of higher rates
at the oldest ages. In contrast, the proportion surviving to a particular age
reflects the effects of mortality only up
to that age; until old age the survival
rate is not affected by the poorer mortality experience of the Jewish aged.
The lower mortality for Jews up to the

 
 

 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

oldest ages is reflected in the better
survival chances of Jews at older ages
in 1987.

Again, we must stress that the factors underlying these patterns, including those responsible for the malefemale contrasts between Jews and
whites cannot be determined from
these data. Whether they stem from
being Jewish per se, from selective inand out-migration of persons with different health status, or from other
factors associated with Jewish identification, such as higher socioeconomic
status and susceptibility to various
kinds of disease, remains to be determined with sets of data not yet available that allow multivariate analysis.

the differences observed in 1963 and

as well as the attenuation of some and
exacerbation of other differences observed in 1963 all argue for continued
attention to the relation between religious identification and mortality patterns. Doing so may help provide
better understanding of the dynamics
underlying changes in mortality in the
population as a whole.
