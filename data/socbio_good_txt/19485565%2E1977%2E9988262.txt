Areal Structure and Rates of Childlessness

Among American Wives in 1970

ABSTRACT: After merging data on counties from the 1970 census and data from 1969 family
planning programs, we aggregated smaller counties as necessary into statistical areal units
(SAU’s) of at least 20,000 white or 10,000 Black women aged 15-44. We used multiple regression
analysis of 12 white and 12 Black subgroups of wives (divided by age and 1969 family income) to
test an explanatory model, based on cost-reward theory, of areal variation in rates of childlessness. Our prediction that childlessness is related to areal differences in alternative roles and other
factors that delay childbearing was strongly supported for white wives and generally confirmed for

Black wives.

Both vital statistics (Heuser, 1976,
Table 6A) and census data (U.S. Bureau
of the Census, 1976, Tables 71 and 74)
report steady increases in childlessness
among younger women over the past decade. For example, census reports show
that among ever-married women aged
20-24, the percentage childless increased
from 24 to 41 per cent between 1960 and
1974. Among ever-married women 25-29,
the increase was from 13 to 20 per cent.
Most of the increase is due to postponing
childbearing and does not accurately measure intentions to remain childless. In 1974
only 5 per cent of white wives aged 18-24
and 4 per cent of comparable Blacks said
they intended to remain childless. However, these figures are much larger than
the comparable 1 per cent of white and
Black wives in 1967. Later age at marriage and improvements in the effectiveness of contraceptive methods (Ryder,
1973; Westoff, 1976) explain some portion
of the changes, but these explanations
have relatively little theoretical interest.

Most previous research has linked either

demographic and socioeconomic factors to
rates of childlessness at one point in time,
or trends in the rates to changes in marital
status, health, and birth control over time.
We discuss some of this work and then
estimate a cost-reward model of childlessness that is a microeconomic theory of
sequential decision making,

PREVIOUS RESEARCH

Most demographic analysts of childlessness have studied older wives known to
have been at risk of pregnancy and who
were childless at the end of their reproductive years. Grabill and Glick (1959)
analyzed published data from the
1910, 1940, and 1950 censuses and the
Current Population Surveys of the 1950’s.
They found, for example, that rates of
childlessness are largest for married
women with college education, full-time
employment, later age at marriage,
white-collar husbands, and urban (versus
rural) residence. Subsequent researchers
have also found that childlessness is
greater in urban areas (Veevers, 1971a)

and is positively related to age at marriage
(Mitra, 1966; Veevers, 19716).

Most recent studies using 1960 and 1970
U.S. census data have focused on either
racial or income differentials. However, the
relationship between income and rates of
childlessness is not particularly clear. For
example, Kunz et al. (1973), examining
1960 census data for married women aged
35-54, found that the percentage of
childlessness usually decreased as husband’s income increased. However, Simon (1974), using 1960 census data for
white wives in two older cohorts, found
that increasing husband’s income decreased childlessness only for wives married at age 22 or later; for wives married
by age 22, no pattern emerged. In 1970
census data on white wives aged 35~—44,
married at age 22 or later, in the labor
force, and with husbands employed in
nonfarm occupations, Poston (1974) found
weak support for a positive relationship
between rates of childlessness and family
income.

For older cohorts, more nonwhites than
whites are childless; for younger cohorts,
the reverse is true. Attempts to explain the
former have focused on whether nonwhites in the older cohorts experienced
more involuntary controls on childbearing
(Grabill and Glick, 1959; Kunz and Brinkerhoff, 1969; Farley, 1970; Veevers,
1971c; McFalls, 1973).

Three recent exploratory studies of voluntarily childless white couples (Gustavus
and Henley, 1971; Veevers, 1973; Nason
and Paloma, 1974), all of whom volunteered for the study, showed that most
couples had above-average SES, urban
residence, low religious affiliation, later
age at marriage, and “very egalitarian sex
roles with an orientation in which the husband and wife are considered to be of
equal value in their relationship with
equal levels of authority and equal levels
of competence” (Veevers, unpublished).

Areal Structure and Childlessness

53

Also, the decision to remain childless usually followed several decisions to postpone
childbearing.

Veevers (1971a, p. 547) suggested that
“variations in the incidence of childlessness will occur concomitantly, and in the
expected direction, with variations in determinants known to affect fertility.”
Thus, factors that explain differential fertility should be very close to those that
explain variation in rates of childlessness.

In sum, data from the U.S. and Canadian censuses and from exploratory studies
fit the cost-reward fertility model used by
Scanzoni (1975, Chap. 1) to explain why
some couples have fewer and others have
more children. The cost-reward model resembles microeconomic models of differential fertility among couples as amended
by theorists who believe that couples are
under rather stable normative pressure to
have at least two children (Blake, 1968;
Namboodiri, 1972; 1974; Turchi, 1975;
Hout, 1976). However, Scanzoni’s emphasis on alternative and changing sex
roles suggests that a reduction in fertility
norms coupled with increasing opportunities for women may now be allowing
previously suppressed variables to affect
rates of childlessness. Scanzoni and
Polonko (unpublished) have argued that
intentional childlessness extends a process
that begins when a couple postpones
childbearing to pursue rewarding alternatives. Eventually, rewards from the alternatives define childbearing as too costly to
experience.

In the cost-reward framework, analysis
of areal variation in childlessness among
younger and older women becomes theoretically reasonable, because factors that
promote postponement of a first birth
should also affect the ultimate rate of
childlessness. If the theory is useful, comparative studies of younger and older
wives should provide parallel and mutually supportive results. )

We examine rates of childlessness for
whites and Blacks separately but do not
try to explain racial differences. Instead,
we argue that if variation in rates of
childlessness across geographic areas is
systematically related to factors of theoretical interest, then variation across areas
probably is due largely to voluntary controls.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

UNITS OF ANALYSIS

Because no theoretical or methodological argument gives clear advantage
to one or the other type of data (Jaffe,
1960; Heer and Boynton, 1970; Cain and
Weininger, 1973), we use both areal and
aggregated individual-level data applied
to geographic areas. Beginning with 1970
U.S. census counts of women aged 15—44,
we used counties to create statistical areal
units (SAU’s). In each SAU we computed
fertility and other characteristics specific
to subgroups (described below). For
whites, one county became one SAU if it
had at least 20,000 white women aged
1$S—44; counties with smaller white populations were aggregated with contiguous
areas. The 3,067 counties with usable data
became 778 SAU’s.

Because many counties have few or no
Black women aged 15-44, we created
SAU’s for Blacks on the basis of at least
10,000 Black women of childbearing age.
Single counties with at least 10,000
became separate SAU’s, while counties
with smaller populations were aggregated.
Overall, we had data on Black women in
only 1,497 counties, which reduced to 237
SAU’s.

CLASSIFICATION OF SUBGROUPS

We divided the two populations by age,
family income, and presence of a husband.
Within each SAU, we divided wives into
age groups 15-19, 20-29, and 30-44 and

 

Social Biology

income groups into above 1969 median
family income ($9,433), between 50 and 99
per cent of the median, and below half the
median (under $4,717). To maintain
reliability, we omitted SAU’s with fewer
than 300 wives in a given subgroup.
Therefore, some subgroups have fewer
than 778 (white) and 237 (Black) SAU’s.

Because of racial differences in the timing and efficacy of contraception (Ryder
and Westoff,:1971; Ryder, 1973; Westoff,
1976), and more illegitimate births for
Black than for white wives before marriage (Cutright and Galle, 1973; Moore,
1976), chance should have a much larger
effect on childlessness for Black wives
than for whites. Thus, the level of explained variance in rates of childlessness
should be lower for Blacks than for
whites.

DEPENDENT VARIABLE

The dependent variable is the rate of
childlessness per thousand wives within
subgroups classified by race, age and family income.

INDEPENDENT VARIABLES

Log density is the natural logarithm of
1970 total population in the counties making up the SAU, divided by square miles.
Increases in density should increase rates
of childlessness because density is positively related to the cost of bearing and
raising children and the roles for women
that encourage childlessness. Across both
white and Black SAU’s, log density is
positively related (r = 0.64) to the percentage of women in urban areas and fits rates
of childlessness slightly better than does
the percentage in urban sreas.

Age at marriage is measured by the
number of never-married women per
thousand women in each SAU, within age
and family income subgroups. For example, wives aged 20-29 in areas with high
proportions of never-married women aged
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

Vol. 24, No. 1

20-29 should be older at marriage than
wives of comparable age in areas with few
never-married women. Also, older age at
marriage is related to higher participation
by women in alternative roles before marriage (for example, as students or members
of the labor force). In areas with later
marriage, women should _ experience
higher costs of having children and less
disapproval of childlessness. Among
whites in particular, older age at marriage
should also reduce the period at risk of
premarital pregnancy at an early age and
thus postpone the date of a first birth.
Therefore, the never-married rate as a
proxy for age at marriage should be positively related to rates of childlessness.

Labor-force participation rates per
thousand wives in a subgroup is a proxy
for working outside the home and should
be positively related to the rate of
childlessness. This variable is not endogenous because the childless status of
older wives results from many years of
sequential decision making and is not an
important cause of labor-force participation in 1970. Because the dependent variable is cumulative in nature, we do not
estimate reciprocal effects between laborforce activity and fertility. Rather, we expect women in areas with more opportunities for work to have higher rates of
childlessness, with the direction of causal
effects being almost entirely from the opportunities to childlessness. Waite and
Stolzenberg (1976, Table 3) provide empirical support for this view. For wives aged
19-29, they found a large negative effect
of greater labor-force plans on expected
fertility, but no significant effect of expected fertility on labor-force plans.

Low education in a subgroup is measured by the number of wives per
thousand with less than eight completed
years of school. We expect low education
to be negatively related to childlessness,
because wives with little education have

Areal Structure and Childlessness

35

fewer alternative role opportunities to
substitute for childbearing than do wives
with more education.

School enrollment for each subgroup,
measured by the number of wives per
thousand enrolled in school, indicates the
effective demand for advanced schooling
by wives in a geographic area. Because
few wives aged 30 and older had enrolled
in school, we omitted the variable for that
age group. Among wives 20-29, coefficients for school enrollment may be
biased because childlessness may have a
small effect on enrollment.

Migration is measured by the number of
wives per thousand in a subgroup who, in
1965, resided outside the county of
residence in 1970. High rates of migration
may be related to economic opportunity
for women and their husbands. Also,
childless couples and those with small
families may be more likely to migrate
than those with larger families. Thus, high
rates of inmigration should be positively
related to rates of childlessness. This
measure is primarily a statistical control
for selection factors to improve specification of the model.

Enrollment in family planning programs
in 1969 was measured (Office of Economic
Opportunity, 1972) by the number of
patients in organized family planning programs per thousand women whose family
incomes were below 200 per cent of the
1969 federal poverty line and who were at
risk of unwanted pregnancy. Women at
risk need birth contro] because at a given
point in time, they are not sterile, not
pregnant, and do not want a pregnancy.
Differences among SAU’s in 1969 reflect
both recent and historical differences in
the delivery of family-planning services to
both upper- and lower-income wives
(Cutright and Jaffe, 19772). Communities
with positive attitudes and _ practices
toward birth control were the first to claim
federal funds for program development in
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

36 Cutright and Polonko

the mid-1960’s and therefore had more
patients in 1969 than communities with
negative attitudes and practices. This
variable does not measure the actual effect
of enrollment on childlessness in 1970. Instead, it is a proxy for the likely cumulative effects on childlessness differences in
communities’ attitudes toward and practices of birth control (Cutright and Jaffe,
1977b). Wives living in communities
favorable to birth control should be more
likely to remain childless than comparable
wives in other communities.

Southern whites have low fertility
(Grove and Hetzel, 1968, Table 22), in
part because they are more likely than
whites outside the South to postpone first
births, whether before or after marriage.
This regional difference may affect rates of
childlessness for older married women.
We included region in analyses of Blacks
to maintain comparable equations for both
racial groups and to test whether the traditionally low childlessness of Southern
Blacks (Farley, 1970, Chapter 4) persisted
in 1970. We also used this variable (coded
1 for SAU’s in the South and 0 for all
others) to assess hypothetical explanations
of racial differences in childlessness based
on unmeasured effects of involuntary controls that might otherwise be assumed to
explain regional differences.

We used wives aged 20-29 per thousand
aged 15-44, by race and family income in
analysis of wives aged 15-44 to control
variation in childless rates due to areal
differences in age structure.

STATISTICS AND THE OLS MODEL

We assume that when applied to rates of
childlessness within subgroups, these independent variables specify a model of
childlessness and minimize aggregation error. Thus, after checks for nonlinear
relationships and heteroscedasticity have
been made, a recursive ordinary least
squares (OLS) regression analysis should

Social Biology

be adequate. The checks showed that to fit
the linear estimation model, only population density had to be transformed.

R* measures the proportion of variation
around the mean of the dependent variable related to variation in the independent variables. The higher the explained variance, the better the model
explains differences among SAU’s in rates
of childlessness. We report the metric
(unstandardized) regression coefficient of
each variable in the OLS-simultaneous solution; the metric coefficient measures the
effect of a change of one unit on independent variables, net of all other
variables in the equation. The variables
used in each equation are listed in Tables 1
and 2. Although we had virtually complete coverage of the population of areal
units, to assess probable stability we
measured the significance level of the regression coefficient for each independent
variable. Significant variables are more
likely than are insignificant ones to repeat
as important predictors.

While the ecological fallacy (Robinson,
1950) is latent in any analysis of areal
data, the important question is whether
aggregation produces a bias. If adequate
statistical controls are in the equation,
then causal factors affecting a dependent
variable in areal analysis should be the
same as causal factors from analysis of
data based on individuals (Hannan and
Burstein, 1974).

RESULTS
CHILDLESSNESS OF WHITES

In 1970, the mean rate of childlessness
per thousand white wives aged 15-44 was
149; for wives 20—29, it was 233; for those
30-44, it was 64. The close dependence of
the rate on age suggests that age-specific
analysis may be superior to analysis of all
wives aged 15~44. Thus, we show results
for ages 15—44 but discuss only age-specific

findings. We did not analyze teenage subgroups because only about 10 per cent of
women 15-19 were living with a husband;
also, in many SAU’s, the number of such
wives was less than the 300 minimum
limit. Within the 30-44 age group, the rate
of childlessness is 81 in the low-income
group, and 61 and 65 respectively in middle- and upper-income groups. Among
wives aged 20-29, mean rates are 261,
194, and 268 for the low-, middle- and
upper-income groups, respectively.

Program enrollment, population density, and Southern residence do not differ
by age or income group. Mean migration
rates are higher in the younger (ages
20-29, 41 per cent) than in the older group
(ages 30-44, 21 per cent), but do not vary
systematically by income. Labor-force
rates are similar in both age groups and
increase from about 25 to 50 per cent between the lowest and the highest familyincome categories. The mean _ loweducation rate is 27 per thousand for
younger and 54 for older wives; in the two
groups respectively, it declines sharply
from 68 to 12 and 161 to 26 as family
income increases.

Although most childless wives 20-29
will eventually have one or more children,
variables in the cost-reward model should
be related to early rates of postponement
as well as to rates of childiessness at the
end of childbearing years. The middle
panel of Table 1 shows explained variance
(R*) and metric regression coefficients. For
wives aged 20-29 in all family-income categories, 83 per cent of the variance across
SAU’s is related to the set of independent
variables, a level that is nearly matched
within two of the three income subgroups.
Also, 30 of the 32 coefficients are statistically significant, and all take the sign expected from the cost-reward theory. Thus,
the net effect of low education is to reduce
rates of childlessness, while school enrollment, labor-force participation, and

Areal Structure and Childlessness

a7

higher population density increase rates.
Areas with more never-married women
also have higher rates, in part because the
wives have married at older ages. Also,
program enrollment, Southern location,
and migration are each positively related
to rates of childlessness.

Among white wives aged 30-44, we find
22 of 28 coefficients are significant. Of the
other six, three are related to low education
and three to Southern residence. Because
the latter had no significant impact on
income-specific rates, we reject the view
that poor health accounts for higher rates
of childlessness among white Southern
wives aged 20-29. Explained variance is
lower for wives aged 30~44 than for
younger women, but it is very low only for
the relatively few wives whose family incomes are less than 50 per cent of the
median income. Maybe the more effective
birth control methods available to the
younger cohort and differences in the effectiveness of use partly account for differences in the fit of the model by age and
income.

The results in Table 1 provide strong
systematic support for the cost-reward
theory of childlessness in the married
white population.

CHILDLESSNESS OF BLACKS

Among Black wives 20-29, the overall
rate of childlessness was 157, with steady
increases from 139 to 145 and then 211 as
family income rises. The overall rate for
the older group was 96, with declines from
107 to 92 and 97 with rising income. Program enrollment levels, log density, and
Southern residence differ little between
age and income groups.

Migration rates are lower for older
wives but similar across income groups.
Labor-force participation and low education fluctuate across income groups in both
age cohorts. In both age groups, laborforce participation moves from about 39 to

56 and then to 78 per cent as family income changes from low to middle and
high. The percentage of wives with low
education is 16 and 7 per cent in the older
and younger groups, respectively. The
percentage with low education drops from
29 to 8 and from 13 to 3 per cent in older
and younger cohorts, respectively, as
family income moves from low to high.
Within the two cohorts, school enrollment
and age at marriage differ little across income categories.

Table 2 shows that for Black wives
20-29 in all income groups, R? is 0.55,

 

indicating good fit to the model. This
equation may provide the best test for this
age group because factors related to
childlessness (low education and laborforce participation) vary greatly by income
level. For both age groups, controlling income places severe controls on these independent variables as well as on sample size
within SAU’s and may therefore reduce
the level of explained variance for income
groups. Loss of SAU’s in income and agespecific subgroups would further bias the
results.

variance for Blacks than for whites, the
model’s impact on childlessness of Blacks
is in the expected direction. In 11 of 12
equations, low education is related to
lower rates of childlessness School enrollment, log density, enrollment in family
planning programs, and age structure are
positive, as expected, in all equations;
migration is positive in 11 of 12.
Labor-force participation has significant
net effects in only three of the eight agespecific equations, but is positive in all
eight. Southern residence has no significant impact, and later age at marriage

does not have the positive effect that it
exerted on white rates.

As Black women improve control of
fertility early in the childbearing years, we
expect the cost-reward model to explain
increasing amounts of variation in their
rates of childlessness. The empirical basis
for this argument is that the same model
used here yields substantially higher explained variance when Black children
ever born (CEB), rather than rates of
childlessness, is used as the dependent
variable Also, using CEB substantially
reduces the difference 1n explained variDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

ance between whites’ and Blacks’ rates of
childlessness. Thus, racial differences in
ability to postpone the first birth may explain racial differences in the impact of the
model on childlessness.

CONCLUSION

We used a cost-reward theory to operationalize and test a model of 1970 rates of
childlessness. The model yields high explained variance for both younger and
older white wives. In general, for younger
and older Black wives, the variables in the
model operate in the predicted direction.
This research suggests that given opportunities to engage in alternative roles,

more rewarding than childbearing, and
successive postponements will eventually
result in voluntary childlessness.

Additional study of variables in the
cost-reward model of childlessness may
help explain the fertility of mothers at
early and late stages of the childbearing
years. Researchers should also use the
cost-reward approach to evaluate the effects of various social policies designed to
postpone early childbearing.
