ABSTRACT: This analysis examines the relationship between maternal determinants and birth
weight in a population-based birth cohort of 5,284 mothers with singleton births of 28 completed
gestational weeks in Qingdao, China, in 1992. Multiple linear regression models suggest that the
length of the menstrual cycle, age at menarche, maternal weight, maternal height, parity, and
number of antenatal visits had independent effects on birth weight after controlling for gestational age and sex of infant. The estimated difference in mean birth weight for each year after
menarche was 11.7 g (95 per cent CI 4.6—18.8), and for each day of the menstrual cycle was
4.0 g (95 per cent CI, 2.1-6.0), after controlling for gestational age, sex of infant, maternal
height, maternal weight, parity and the number of antenatal visits. No substantial differences
in determinants of birth weight were found between the sexes. Maternal age, education, and
occupation failed to reveal any significant association with birth weight. In sum, those women
who reached menarche younger and had a relatively short menstrual cycle had a heavier baby

 

on average, and the determinants of birth weight did not differ between male and female in the

cohort.

Birth weight of an infant is the
single most important determinant of
survival, growth, and development
(WHO, 1984). Various anthropometric, demographic, socioeconomic, and
perinatal correlates of birth weight in
populations have been described in
the developed countries (Rantakallio,
1969; Winikoff and Debrovner, 1981;
Ventura, 1982; Forbes and Small,
1983; Klebanoff et al., 1984), but much
less work has been done in the developing countries. China, one of the largest developing countries of the world,
possesses its own special socioeconomic environment and cultural traditions which make Chinese women at
childbearing age a highly homogeneous population in terms of age at first

birth, marital status, schooling, socioeconomic status, and so on (People’s
Republic of China, 1991). This study
was conducted on a population-based
one-year birth cohort from Qingdao,
China in 1992 to describe the distribution of the cohort by birth weight and
to explore the relationship between
maternal factors and birth weight, with
special reference to menstrual history.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Qingdao is one of the largest cities
on the east coast of China, with a population of more than one million distributed among the five administrative
districts in its urban area. The basic
data on birth cohort were obtained in

175

176

1992 from birth records kept by the
Qingdao Health Center for Women
and Children with respect to all 18 hospitals distributed over these administrative districts. The information available from the birth records included
maternal name and age, date of delivery, birth weight and length, gestational age, outcome of birth, mode of
delivery and cause of death for stillbirths and neonatal deaths.

More detailed information on maternity was collected from the Perinatal
Health Care Records kept by the maternity and children’s health care doctors for all pregnant women from
their first antenatal visit onward. The
women had to bring the records with
them each time they attended an antenatal clinic, and the records were retained by the hospitals where the
women gave birth.

The maternity and children’s health
centers at the level of the administrative district were routinely responsible
for collecting the records from all
the hospitals located in their area.
The health centers also regularly exchanged records in order to retrieve
those records belonging to women who
were inhabitants of their districts but
who had given birth at a hospital located elsewhere. The information provided by the records covered maternal
demographics, pregnancy-related factors, antenatal care, constitutional factors, and menstrual history. The data
from the birth records were linked to
the antenatal records by means of
the maternal name, age, and date of
delivery.

For this study, the data from only
three of the five administrative districts, Cangkou, Cifang, and Taidong,
were analyzed because a part of the

records was missing in the other two
districts, Shinan and Shibei. There
were a total of 5,634 eligible births in
these three districts in 1992, of which
5,505 (98.0 per cent) were entered into
our data set. Since the present analysis
was restricted to singletons with 28
completed gestational weeks and at
least 1,000 g in birth weight, 81 multiple births (1.5 per cent) and one premature birth less than 28 gestational
weeks were excluded. In addition, 139
other cases (2.5 per cent) were excluded, including 72 in which the number of offspring was unknown, 21 in
which the birth weight was unknown,
and 46 extreme outliers regarding birth
weight, gestational age, or the menstrual cycle. This selection procedure
resulted in a cohort of 5,284 singleton
births for the present study.

Age at menarche, the length of
menstrual cycle, and other maternal information were recorded, along with
measurements performed by doctors at
the mothers’ first antenatal visits. The
length of menstrual cycle was recorded
as an average length, which was obtained by asking the question “How
many days was your menstrual cycle on
average before the pregnancy? (The
length of menstrual cycle is defined as
the first day of the period until the last
day of the whole cycle).”” Outcomes of
pregnancy and information on the neonates were recorded by midwives or
obstetricians during labor in the hospitals. Birth weights were recorded to
the nearest 50 g, and gestational age
was calculated as the interval between.
the first day of the mother’s last menstrual period and the date of delivery.

The mothers’ education was originally recorded as college (including
postgraduate), secondary school, ele

mentary school, and illiterate, which in
terms of the current Chinese educational system, indicates a duration of
schooling of >=13, 7-12, <=6
years, respectively. The mothers’ occupations, according to the Chinese classification, were recorded in terms of
cadre strata—including various grades
of managers in government organizations and state-owned businesses, doctors, lawyers, teachers, and most other
occupations requiring a higher level of
education and special professionals,
and non-cadre strata—including servants, workers, the self-employed, a
few farmers, the unemployed, and all
others without cadre status.

The effect of marital status could
not be estimated because almost all the
mothers in the cohort were married at
delivery. According to Chinese marriage law, divorce is not allowed during
a woman’s pregnancy or before the
baby is one year old. Based on the data
of the China National Survey 1990
(People’s Republic of China, 1991),
the rate of divorce was less than 0.8 per
cent among women of child-bearing
age in urban areas of China).

Description of the variables included in the study are presented in
Table 1. One-way analysis of variance
was used to test the null hypothesis that
the mean birth weights among the different categories for each explanatory
variable are equal. Those variables
with p values less than 0.05 in one-way
analysis of variance were included in
multiple regression analysis in the form
of continuous variables. To determine
whether a factor contributed to the
variation in birth weight independent
of both gestational age and sex of the
infant, we performed a multiple linear
regression analysis in which the factor

Birth Weight in China

 

177

was entered after both gestational age
and infant sex. Polynomial models
were applied if a function of over firstorder regression was found between
birth weight and the independent variables. Interactions were considered if
the product terms among independent
variables were Statistically significant
in their prediction of birth weight. To
control for the impact of variation with
timing of maternal weight measurement, the first antenatal visit was kept
in the multiple models. The same analysis procedures mentioned above were
taken for males and females separately
to find out if there was any difference
in maternal determinants of birth
weight between the sexes. Those with
p values less or equal to 0.05 were entered into the model. SPSS for Windows 6.1 was used to analyze the data.

RESULTS

The distributions of maternal factors in the birth cohort are given in
Table 1. The structure in terms of maternal age was highly concentrated in
the twenties, and there was only one
mother less than 20 years. About 83
per cent had 12 years of schooling or
less, over three-quarters were classified as non-cadres, and 93 per cent
of the parturient was primiparae. Concerning antenatal care, most of the
pregnant women began to visit the
mother and child health care centers
during the second trimester. The numbers of antenatal visits ranged from 0 to
18, with a mean of 7.5.

The results of the one-way analyses
of variance are shown in Table 1 as
well. The mean birth weights of the

were greater than for those whose
mothers had not, the trend being
clearly a linear one (p<0.001).
Similarly, the mean birth weight was
greater among multiparous than
among primiparous mothers, with a
difference of 129 g (p<0.001). The
number of antenatal visits before delivery was positively associated to the
mean birth weight, but no linear relation was observed with the time of the
first antenatal visit, even though the
differences in means among the groups
were statistically significant. Both age
at menarche and the length of menstrual cycle were significantly correlated with birth weight. Mean birth
weights were greater if the mother
had reached menarche before 14 years
of age and were progressively greater
the shorter the menstrual cycle was,
the latter trend giving a significant result in a test of linearity. In addition,
both the mother’s height and weight
during pregnancy were positively related to mean birth weights, whereas
education and occupation were not statistically significant at the level of 0.05.

All the variables that were statistically significant (p <0.05) in relation
to birth weight in one-way analysis of
variance were included in a multiple
regression analysis after controlling for
gestational age, with both linear and
quadratic terms, and the sex of the infant. Variables which were significant
in partial F tests were maternal height,
maternal weight, menstrual cycle, parity, age at menarche, and the number
of antenatal visits, indicating that these
variables had made significant contributions to birth weight independent of
the gestational age and the sex of the
infant (see Table 2). When analyses
were made for males and females sep

arately, all the variables still made significant contributions to the linear regression models, and no substantial
differences in estimated effects were
found between the two models. No
product terms among independent
variables made significant contributions to prediction of birth weight.

The results of the effects of age at
menarche and length of menstrual cycle on birth weight after adjusting for
gestational age, sex of infant, maternal
height, maternal weight, parity, and
the number of antenatal visits are
shown in Table 3. The estimated effects were about 12.0 g (95 per cent Cl
4.6-18.8) per year for age at menarche
and about 4.0 g (95 per cent CI 2.06.0) per day for menstrual cycle. The
results had changed somewhat compared with the corresponding results
shown in Table 2, but they still made
independent contributions to prediction of birth weights.

DISCUSSION

China, being a large developing
country which possesses a special socioeconomic and cultural environment
of its own, has specific characteristics
that differentiate it from other countries. These characteristics include less
smoking among women of. childbearing age (Fung et al., 1989; Yip Li,
1991), a low rate of divorce, a low incidence of teenage mothers, a high
proportion of families with one child,
and a concentration of child-bearing to
mothers in their twenties (People’s Republic of China, 1991). All these characteristics have undoubtedly exerted a
substantial impact on pregnancy outcomes in the population. The present

target population may not be representative of the whole country, but it
should be a good example of the urban
population of China, possessing all the
characteristics mentioned above.
Almost all pregnant women have
the right to free or very cheap perinatal
health care in urban areas of China.
Pregnant women and their families
normally pay great attention to the
pregnancy and place much hope in the
fetus, who will be probably the only
child in the family in the future because
of the current family planning policy in
China. We have reason to believe that
pregnant women cooperate fully with

 

the doctors at their antenatal visits and
take the questions asked of them seriously. This situation suggests that collected data should be reliable.

One of the specific characteristics of
this population was that the maternal
age structure showed a high concentration of mothers in their twenties. According to current marital law in
China, the legal age for marriage is 20
years for women and 22 years for men,
and urban residents who marry just after reaching the legal age are not allowed to have babies until they have
obtained permission from the family
planning organizations. This process

will probably take them one or two
years, or even more, depending on the
area. This situation may explain the
finding that maternal age was not statistically correlated with birth weight.
According to Kramer (1987), young
teenagers or women over 35 years of
age may exhibit impaired intrauterine
growth or gestational duration, but the
present population included only one
mother aged less than 20 years and 138
mothers (2.6 per cent) over 35 years.
Thus, no further interpretation could
be provided on the effects of extremes
in the maternal age spectrum on birth
weight.

Neither maternal education nor occupation were related to birth weight
in this analysis, although different results have been reported by others concerning the relationship between maternal education, occupation, and birth
weight (Lechtig et al., 1975; Scott et
al., 1981; Linn et al., 1982; DaVanzo et
al., 1984). Kramer (1987) inferred in
his review that socioeconomic status
has no independent effect on intrauterine growth, and low socioeconomic
status may be a social “cause” of other
nutritional, toxic, anthropometric, or
infection factors that may themselves
be determinants of birth weight. However, education and occupation may
not be good indicators of economic
background and living standards
among urban residents in China because of the small differences in incomes between cadres and non-cadres.
Thus, in this population, those workers
who would normally be ranked in the
lower social classes by the standards of
other countries, e.g., workers in the
non-cadre strata, may well earn more
money than those with higher education levels and good jobs. In addition,

Birth Weight in China

181

there is universal access to health care
and education for women in the urban
areas of China, and women can receive
all the basic health care and nutrition
during pregnancy that is necessary for
adequate fetal growth (Yan, 1989; Yip
et al., 1991).

Good antenatal care is suggested to
have a beneficial impact on intrauterine growth and gestational duration,
either through the diagnosis and timely
treatment of pregnancy complications
or by eliminating or reducing modifiable risk factors. Concerning the number of antenatal visits, the greater the
number of contacts with health professionals who attempt to reduce or eliminate risk factors and treat pregnancy
complications, the better the outcome
should theoretically be. Some surveys
in developed countries have reported
positive results in this respect (Lechtig
et al., 1975; Showstack et al., 1984).
In our analysis, the number of antenatal visits had independent effects on
birth weight after adjusting for gestational age and sex. Thus, the mean
birth weight would have been about
7.1 g (95 per cent CI 2.7-11.5) greater
if each mother had made one more
antenatal visit. The timing of the first
antenatal visit was not Statistically
significant in multiple analysis as it was
in the one-way analysis of variance.
This result may be due to the possibility of negative confounding effects
when describing the relationship between antenatal care and the outcome
of pregnancy, i.e., the women who
seek antenatal care at an early stage
may be those who have experienced
problems. We could not avoid such
“confounding by indication” (Kramer,
1987) in this analysis, which may explain the fact that emerged in the
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

182

one-way analysis of variance, (Table 1)
that those women who made their first
antenatal visit during the first trimester
of pregnancy had babies with lower
mean birth weights than those who did
so later in the pregnancy.

Age at menarche was found to have
an independent effect on birth weight,
that is, those women who reached menarche younger had a heavier baby on
average than those who were older, after controlling for the other variables
mentioned above. A similar result was
reported by DaVanzo from Malaysia
(DaVanzo et al., 1984). Age at menarche is thought to reflect the nutrition
of pubescent girls (Tanner, 1962), in
that nutrition affects their size (Tanner, 1962) and a small size tends to
delay the onset of menarche (Frisch
and McArthur, 1974). Menarche is
also associated with socioeconomic status (Rantakallio, 1969; Simell, 1952).
Thus, the relationship between birth
weight and age at menarche may be understood at least partly in terms of a
mechanism in which nutrition, height,
and socioeconomic status influence
birth weight in addition to the independent impact of the factor as such.

One interesting finding in this analysis concerns the relationship between
the length of menstrual cycle and birth
weight. As shown in Tables 1-3, those
mothers with a shorter menstrual cycle
on average had heavier babies than
those with a longer cycle. The estimated effect for each day of the menstrual cycle was 5.5 g, after adjustment
for gestational age and sex of infant.
Furthermore, when maternal height,
maternal weight, parity, and the number of antenatal visits were included in
the model as well, the effect remained

Xu et al.

 

Social Biology

significant (4.0 g, 95 per cent CI 2.16.0).

Thus far we know of no other published report dealing with the relationship of the menstrual cycle to birth
weight. No statistically significant interactions with respect to birth weight
were found here between the menstrual cycle and other independent
variables. We can hardly say that any
substantial bias would arise in rounding newborns’ birth weights. Chance
and method of rounding was equal for
every newborn, and any bias because
of rounding, should be a nondifferential misclassification, which tends toward the null value and probably
would have weakened the existing association of interest (Rothman, 1986).

The length of the menstrual cycle
could perhaps be an indicator of the
development and of the functioning of
the female’s hormone endocrinological
environment and mechanism. Those
women who experience a short menstrual cycle may be reflecting better
development of their sex organs and
hormonal activity, which would benefit
fetal development during pregnancy.
Even though the estimated effect revealed by our analyses is small, the results could hardly be explained by
chance, as the partial F tests had provided P values of less than 0.001. The
results encourage further evaluation of
an association between the length of
mothers’ menstrual cycles and the birth
weight of newborns among different
populations and an exploration of possible biological mechanisms.

Variables which are commonly recognized as being important for the prediction of birth weight but which could
not be assessed in this analysis are nuDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

tritional factors during pregnancy, an
adverse reproductive history, and
smoking. Smoking is less important as
a variable not included in this analysis
because smoking is extremely rare
among women childbearing age in
China. Based on the data of a recent
report (Wen et al., 1995), no smoking
mothers were found among 1,862 Chinese women who delivered at a central
maternity hospital in Hefei, Anhui
province from 1990 to 1991. Adverse
reproductive history could not account
for much of the variation in birth
weight either, considering that 93 per
cent of the mothers were primiparae.
Most of the references in the literature
dealing with nutritional factors regard
the mother’s nutritional status during
pregnancy as an independent determinant of birth weight (Rush, 1980; Papoz, 1982). Had nutritional status during pregnancy been adjusted for along
with the other factors controlled in

this analysis, it would have helped us to
interpret the results better.

In conclusion, after controlling for
gestational age, sex, maternal weight,
maternal height, parity, and number
of antenatal care visits, we found that
those women who reached menarche
younger and who had a relatively short
menstrual cycle had a heavier baby on
average. We found no difference in influencing factors on birth weight between males and females. In addition,
maternal socioeconomic indicators had
no substantial impact on the weight of
infants in the urban area of Qingdao,
China.
