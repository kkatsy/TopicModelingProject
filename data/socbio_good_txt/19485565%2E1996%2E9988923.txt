ABSTRACT: It is widely assumed that employment and breastfeeding are relatively incompatible
behaviors in the United States; yet recently both the incidence of breastfeeding and the incidence
of postpartum employment increased. This paper examines the relationship between these trends
from 1968-86 using data from the National Surveys of Family Growth. I find that these trends
result from increases in the likelihood that a woman engages in both breastfeeding and postpartum employment. There has been an increase over time in the incidence and duration of
women concurrently breastfeeding and working. However, the majority of employed women did
not concurrently breastfeed, suggesting that conflicts between these behaviors still exist.

One of the major social changes in
the United States during the last three
decades has been the growing number
of mothers with children participating
in the labor market. This changing pattern of labor force participation has included mothers of even the youngest
children; currently more than half of
women with children under one year
of age are in the labor market (O’Connell, 1990). During much of this same
period, American women also increased their rates of breastfeeding.
While less than 30 per cent of women
breastfed their infants during the
1960’s, by the period 1983-86, 56 per
cent of women initiated breastfeeding
(Duberstein, 1993).

These concurrent increases in the
incidence of breastfeeding and the incidence of postpartum employment are
puzzling in light of the belief that these
are relatively incompatible behaviors.
Studies have observed a negative relationship between the duration of
breastfeeding and maternal employ
ment, with long durations of breastfeeding associated with a later entry to
postpartum employment and fewer
hours of employment (Kurinji et al.,
1989; Lindberg, 1996; Ryan and Martinez, 1989). Proponents of breastfeeding have expressed concern that the
increases in postpartum employment
might have negative health consequences through decreased breastfeeding (Barber-Madden, 1990; DHHS,
1984; La Leche League, 1981), and
there has been a growth of programs
aimed at promoting breastfeeding
among employed women (see Spisak
and Gross, 1991, for examples).

The analysis of population trends
risks falling prey to ecological fallacies
in which incorrect conclusions are
drawn about individuals based solely
on the observation of population data
(Babbie, 1989). It is dangerous to assume that the independent trends in
breastfeeding and postpartum employment derive from increases in the likelihood that an individual woman both

breastfeeds and works during the postpartum period. For example, during
the 1980’s about 50 per cent of all
mothers breastfed and about 50 per
cent worked during the postpartum
period. It is possible, for example, that
not a single woman could engage in
both of these behaviors, yet the two
observed rates could coexist. While
this is an extreme example, it makes
evident that the trends in breastfeeding
and postpartum employment could result from women engaging in one of the
behaviors exclusive of engagement in
the other.

I use data from the National Surveys
of Family Growth to explore the association between these two trends during the period 1968-86. Using data
from the four waves of the National
Surveys of Family Growth, I first calculate trends in these behaviors from
1968-86. Second, I determine to what
extent the trends represent changes
in the likelihood that an individual
woman engages in both breastfeeding
and postpartum employment. Finally,
J examine the relative timing of the behaviors to consider ways that women
may choose to balance the demands of
each. Together these analyses all try to
reconcile the trends in each behavior in
light of their potential incompatibility.

By focusing on the relationship between the aggregate trends, this work
provides needed information not otherwise available for designing public
policy. With a paucity of empirical
evidence concerning the relationship
between women’s employment and
breastfeeding behaviors in the United
States, former Surgeon General Koop
noted that the “‘data necessary to direct
effective promotional efforts to working women and to those whose influ

ence them are not available (DHHS,
1989).” This project will provide data
relevant to national health goals to increase the incidence and duration of
breastfeeding in the U.S.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

These analyses use data from the
National Surveys of Family Growth
(NSFG) Waves I-IV. Conducted by
the National Center for Health Statistics in 1973, 1976, 1982, and 1988,
these cross-sectional surveys interviewed a nationally representative random stratified sample of women ages
15 to 44.! Details of the sampling and
data collection procedures for the four
waves can be found elsewhere (NCHS,
1978, 1981, 1985a, 19855). The analyses reported here use post-stratified
sampling weights that also correct for
non-response. Each NSFG wave collected comparable information on both
women’s infant feeding and postpartum employment behaviors, making
them well-suited to these analyses.

1While Waves III and IV included all women regardless of marital history, Waves I and II of the
NSFG were limited to ever-married women or those
with their own child living in the household. Not
collecting information from never-married women
without their own child in the household at the time
of the survey may produce biases by excluding a
highly selective population of women who may have
given up their children to adoption or fosterage (see
Geronimus and Korenman, 1993; Burton, 1990).
Exploratory analyses suggest that the magnitude of
this bias is extremely small. In Wave III and Wave
IV, approximately 2 per cent of never-married
women with their most recent birth occurring in the
last five years did not reside with their child at the
time of the survey. If the magnitude of this pattern
was similar in the periods covered in Wave I and II,
then few potentially eligible women would be excluded from Waves I and II because of nonresidential children.

SAMPLE AND VARIABLES

The NSFG collected information on
breastfeeding incidence and duration
for each birth. Women were asked
“When (child) was an infant, did you
breastfeed (her/him) at all?” If they
answered affirmatively, they were also
asked ‘How many weeks old was
(s/he) when you stopped breastfeeding
(her/him) altogether?” In these analyses, breastfeeding duration is measured in months to permit comparisons
5 to the timing of employment; any
® woman reporting that she initiated
oo breastfeeding, but breastfed less than
— one month is coded as breastfeeding
= for one month. Women whose youngest child was not living with them at the
age of two months were also excluded,
reducing any confounding effects of infant mortality and adoption.

A woman at work within one year of
the delivery is coded as participating
in postpartum employment. The usual
definition of labor force participation
includes individuals at work, those who
~, have a job but are not currently at
work (e.g., vacation), and those looking for a job. The NSFG collects information only about this first aspect—
when the woman was at work following
a birth. This distinction is important
since a significant proportion of the
women employed postpartum are not
actually at work (Klerman and Leibowitz, 1993).

Data constraints required focusing
on experiences surrounding each woman’s most recent birth, since information on the timing of employment after
childbirth was collected only in reference to this birth. I also restrict the
sample to women who had their most
recent birth at least one and no more

than five years prior to the survey. This
removes the problem of right censoring
in the measurement of postpartum
employment, since at least 12 months
have elapsed since birth for each
woman, as well as reducing the risk of
reporting errors associated with retrospective information (Groves, 1989;
Haaga, 1988).2 To examine trends, I
define samples from each NSFG wave
that do not include overlapping years.
Each waves thus serves as a distinct period, spanning from 1968-86. Table 1
summarizes the data used from each
NSFG wave.

ANALYTICAL MEASURES

I define four aggregate measures of
breastfeeding and postpartum employment behaviors. First, a woman engages in exclusive behaviors if she engages in one but not the other during
the postpartum period. In contrast, a
woman engages in dual behaviors if she
engages in both behaviors during the
first year following a birth, without any
necessary overlap in the timing of the
behaviors. The dual behaviors can be
further divided to describe the relative
timing of a woman’s breastfeeding
and postpartum employment. Sequential behaviors indicate that a woman
both breastfeeds and works postpartum, but sequences these behaviors by
stopping breastfeeding before making

2An alternate approach is to use current-status
data, which creates synthetic cohorts of women
based upon behaviors at the time of the survey (see
John et al., 1988). While this method is common in
research in LDC settings, it is not often used for
U.S. data. With low fertility and short breastfeeding
durations, the number of women observed breastfeeding at the time of the survey likely is too small
for robust estimates.

the transition into employment.? Concurrent behaviors refer to a woman
breastfeeding and working simultaneously during at least some of the
postpartum period.*

The incidence of sequential and
concurrent behaviors are measured
with some error depending upon when
in the month the behaviors occurred.
Although the relative timing of the behaviors is measured in months, a single
month can indicate an interval from
one day to eight weeks.> To incorporate this variability, an alternate and
broader liberal definition of concurrent
behaviors is created which includes
women who enter employment within

3Incidence of Sequential Behaviors =
[# women (breastfeeding duration < I) and (enter
employment > = I)/# women giving birth] * 100,
where I < = 12 months postpartum.

*Incidence of Concurrent Behaviors =
[# women (breastfeeding duration = I) and (enter
employment <I) / # women giving birth] * 100,
where I < = 12 months postpartum.
This definition of concurrent behaviors may exclude
a small number of women who breastfeed and work
concurrently, but do not initiate this pattern until
after 12 months postpartum (for example if a
woman breastfed for 18 months and entered employment in month 14).

5A woman starting employment on June 30 and
stopping breastfeeding on July 1 and is coded as having one month of concurrent behavior, although the
actual time elapsed is only one day. Yet a woman
starting employment on June 1 and stopping breastfeeding on July 31 is also coded as having a one
month interval between behaviors, while the actual
time elapsed is eight weeks.

one month before or after they stop
breastfeeding. In the following sections, I use these analytical measures
to examine the relationship between
the trends in breastfeeding and postpartum employment from 1968-86.

RESULTS

INDEPENDENT TRENDS

To my knowledge, no study has examined trends in breastfeeding and
trends in postpartum employment with
the same data set and methods. I use
the four waves of the NSFG to consider
whether some trends reported elsewhere may be measurement artifacts.
The NSFG corroborates other reports
of increases during the last two decades
in both the incidence of breastfeeding
(Ryan et al., 1991a) and the incidence
of postpartum employment (O’Connell, 1990), as shown in Figure 1. The
incidence of postpartum employment
rose from about 30 per cent of women
in 1968-72, to slightly more than half
of eligible women by 1983-86. The
trend in the incidence of breastfeeding
followed a similar pattern. Figures 2
and 3 show that the timing of the two
behaviors also changed, as generally
women stopped breastfeeding later
in the postpartum period, while they
entered work earlier from 1968 to
1986.

conservative and a liberal definition of

breastfed and worked concurrently in
either of the first two time periods. By
the 1983-86 period, the incidence of
concurrent behaviors (by the conservative definition) had increased sharply
to 11.9 per cent of all women. Sequential behaviors also became consistently
more common, and from 1968-86 their
incidence increased significantly from
5.1 per cent to 17.5 per cent of women.

behaviors includes 22.6 per cent of
women, twice the per cent of women
engaging in concurrent behaviors under the conservative definition. Since
the per cent of women engaging in both
breastfeeding and postpartum employment stays constant between these two
definitions, the more liberal measure
only shifts women from a pattern of
sequential to concurrent behaviors.
Specifically, it includes in concurrent
behaviors women stopping breastfeeding within one month before entering
employment. Comparing the two sets
of definitions I can conclude that more
than 10 per cent of women overall stop

tering employment.

RELATIVE INCIDENCE OF DUAL
BEHAVIORS

I next measure the relative incidence of exclusive, dual, concurrent,
and sequential behaviors among those
women engaging in either breastfeeding (Figure 4) or postpartum employment (Figure 5). In these measures,
the numerator is the same as in the
measures for all women; only the denominator changes to reflect the new
population at risk. In Figure 4, the
height of each bar indicates the total
per cent of women engaging in breastfeeding in the period. Each column is
divided into exclusive, sequential, and
concurrent, using the conservative defVol. 43, No. 3-4

behaviors total the incidence of dual

For example, in 1968-71, 6.3 per
cent of women who breastfed also
worked concurrently, while 22.7 per
cent breastfed and worked sequentially. When summed, this indicates
that the relative incidence of dual behaviors among breastfeeding women

of dual behaviors was 6.5 per cent (as
measured against the y-axis). In contrast, by 1983-86 the relative and absolute incidence of dual behaviors rose
to about 53 and 29 per cent respectively. Over time, the relative incidence of exclusive behaviors declined
sharply, from about 71 to 47 per cent
of all breastfeeding women, while the
absolute incidence increased. Thus, by
1983-86, more than half of women
initiating breastfeeding also worked
sometime during the postpartum period and more than one in five did so
concurrently.

spent in concurrent behaviors, among
all women engaging in these behaviors.
These measures are based on the conservative definition of concurrent behaviors. In 1977-80, half of those
women engaging in concurrent behaviors did so for only 1-3 months. By
1983-86, this figure had fallen to only
40 per cent, while more women engaged in concurrent behaviors for 4-6
months than during the previous period. A chi-square test indicates that
overall the periods are significantly different at the 0.05 level. Not only did
more women engage in concurrent behaviors over time, but they seem to
have done so for longer durations.

Additional analyses (not shown)
calculated the distribution for months
spent in concurrent behaviors based on
the more liberal definition of this behavior. Including women who stopped
breastfeeding within one month of entering employment sharply increases
the per cent of women engaging in concurrent behaviors for very short durations.

DISCUSSION

In this paper, I have examined the
relationship between breastfeeding
and postpartum employment, as well
as changes in this relationship over
time. By systematically relating these
two behaviors through comparable
measures, I find that the increases in
the overall rate of breastfeeding and
the overall rate of postpartum employment represent, in part, increases in
the likelihood that a woman engages in
both behaviors during the postpartum
period. From 1968-86 there is an increase in the percentage of women who
engaged in both of these behaviors

during the first twelve months postpartum, rising from 6 per cent to 25 per
cent of all women.

While many women are both breastfeeding and working, the majority of
these are choosing to do so at different
times during the postpartum period.
However, from 1968-86 there is a
growing population of women concurrently engaging in breastfeeding and
employment. Many of these women
appear to have overlap in the timing of
these behaviors only in the months surrounding their transition to postpartum employment. Previous research
shows that women are most likely to
stop breastfeeding in the month that
they enter employment (Lindberg,
1996). Thus most women engage in
concurrent behaviors for a short period
of time, although there is evidence of
increasing durations.

The increases in the proportion of
women engaging in both behaviors
concurrently and the increases in the
duration of concurrent behaviors suggests that women were better able to
combine work and breastfeeding over
the 1968-86 period. However, the majority of employed women did not concurrently breastfeed, suggesting that
conflicts between breastfeeding and
employment likely still exist. Surveys
of employers during this period found
little evidence of accommodation to
breastfeeding women; there was limited provision of space for breast
pumping for refrigeration of mothers’

_milk, and limited access to breastfeed
ing breaks that would make concurrent
breastfeeding and employment more
convenient (MacLaughlin and Strelnick, 1984; Moore and Jansa, 1987).
Given the apparent lack of supportive
work environments, the increases in

Vol. 43, No. 3-4

concurrent behaviors are all the more
dramatic.

Health professionals responsible for
influencing and supporting women’s
breastfeeding must be aware that the
majority of women who choose to
breastfeed will also be employed sometime during the postpartum period. Information about how and when to
add supplemental feeding, the need for
maintaining milk supply, and greater
information about expressing breastmilk are all needed. Information is not
systematically collected from any other
source about milk expression or number and timing of feedings. High rates
of milk expression in a non-random
sample of employed women suggest
that expression is a common means of
maintaining the n milk supply, and physical comfort, during the_ workday
(Auerbach and Guss, 1984). ~

Workplace policies which provide
greater accommodation to breastfeeding are also relevant. I found that
about one-quarter of the women who
are at work postpartum will also be
concurrently breastfeeding for at least
one month. Such measures offer employees a basis for making projections
for the demand for breastfeeding ac

commodations. If the trend toward
earlier postpartum employment continues, the pool of women potentially
desiring to breastfeed at work may also
increase.

Further study is needed of women
who do manage to breastfeed and work
during the same time period. Greater
understanding of the factors, whether
structural, social, or psychological,
which facilitate their combining these
behaviors, and the factors which act as
barriers, would assist in helping other
women to do so. Mothers with infants
have become a permanent part of the
labor force, and achieving our public
health goals for increasing breastfeeding will require assisting working mothers in combining these behaviors.
