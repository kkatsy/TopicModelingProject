ABSTRACT: Data from this study and five earlier studies are analyzed to determine the magnitude
and significance of the influence of sex combinations of prior children upon the ultimate (or
completed) number of children in the family. In addition to confirming the observation of earlier
investigators that the influence of combinations of sexes in the first two children differs by
geographic area, it is shown that a difference has occurred in a single region over time, and the
data for the most recent cohort suggest an effect of social class as well. Three measures of
association (the corrected odds ratio, the natural logarithm of this ratio, and the fourfold point
correlation) point to a small magnitude of the influence studied even when it is present at a
statistically significant level. Notes on sample size relative to levels of a and £ errors are included,
as is discussion of a valid method of combining contingency tables.

Among the factors determining the
number of persons to be supported by a
finite earth are birth rate, age at reproduction, and mortality. Ultimate (or
“complete”) family size reflects the interaction of these three variables and can
serve as an indicator of the rate at which a
population is expanding or contracting in
size. Several recent studies have indicated
that the combination of sexes among the
offspring already present may influence
ultimate family size by affecting the decision of parents to limit their reproduction
(Loyd and Gray, 1969; Ayala and Falk,
1971; Gray, 1972; Gray and Morrison,
1974).

Empirical evidence on this point has
been found to differ by geographic location and by (inferred) social class of the
parents. An investigation of this question
some twenty-five years ago (Thomas,
1951), using 470 families related to medical students at the University of Glasgow,
found that the frequency of families having more than two children was sig
nificantly higher when the first two children were of the same sex than when they
were of opposite sex. Loyd and Gray
(1969) reported similar results when they
studied 690 families of college students
from central Kentucky.

On the other hand, Ayala and Falk
(1971) examined data for 425 immediate
families of college students resident in
New England and found no significant
difference in these frequencies. In addition, they reanalyzed the data presented
by Gray and pointed out that owing to the
lack of independence between those
families having only two children and
those having more than two, Gray’s statistical test was of “doubtful validity”. Ayala
and Falk then concluded that the sex
of the first two children had indeed
influenced family size in the Glasgow
sample, but not in the two American
studies.

Three years after his first study with R.
C. Loyd (Loyd and Gray, 1969), Gray
(1972) collected data for 415 additional

210

families of students with the express purpose of increasing the total sample size.
Given the same marginal distributions in
the two tables, it is possible to force significance in a chi-square test of independence in a 2 X 2 table solely from the increase in total number. When the data in
Gray’s 1969 and 1972 samples are compared, a more serious difficulty comes to
light. The total proportion of parents having more than two children is 59 per cent
in the 1969 data and 75 per cent in the
1972 data. Hence the significant chisquare for the combined data (vy? = 4.28,
d.f. = 1, p = 0.039) could be an artifact of
the increased number and of the improper
combination of two tables (for discussion
of this point, see Li, 1961, pp. 84—86, and
Fleiss, 1973, pp. 123-124). Thus we are
left with no significant effect of the combination of sexes in the first two children
upon increase in family size from either set
of the Kentucky data taken individually.

Gray and Morrison (1974) have reported
the same comparison for three additional
groups. A fourth group was ascertained
only through males in a Job Corps training
program and did not include any families
with two girls as first two children. The
three sets of data that are comparable to
previous studies were obtained from
families of (1) 784 black college students at
Kentucky State University and at Tennessee State University (Population 1); (2) 802
Appalachian college students at Morehead
State University (Population 2); and (3)
420 college students at Vanderbilt University (Population 3). The chi-square values
for these data (from 2 X 2 tables, using
Yates’ correction for continuity) are as follows: for Population 1, xy? = 0.13 (@ =
0.71); for Population 2, vy? = 0.01 (p =
0.91); and for Population 3, x? = 14.84 (p
< 0.001).

These same authors examined decision
points other than that after two children,
extending their analysis in each population

 

Sex of Children and Ultimate Family Size

to the effect of the sex of the first three and
first four children upon ultimate family
size. In each of Populations 1, 2, and 3, a
higher percentage of parents increased
their number of offspring when only one
sex was represented in three prior offspring. This difference was not statistically significant in Population 3, but was
significant for both Populations 1 and 2.
The authors suggested that the lack of
statistical significance in Population 3
might be attributed to the smaller sample
size (283 vs. 666 and 542) in Populations 1
and 2 for this comparison). In the case of
the first four children being of the same
sex, in each of the populations a higher
percentage of parents augmented their
family than did those parents who had
children of both sexes among the first four.
In none of the three populations did this
difference attain the 0.05 level of statistical significance; and again the authors attributed this lack of significance to small
sample sizes (498, 360, and 142 in Populations 1, 2, and 3 respectively).

The general conclusion reached by Gray
and Morrison (1974) was that in some
populations “the desire that parents have
for children of both sexes influences the
decision to have additional children.”
They add that “this desire becomes a
measurable force after two children in
some populations and after three children
in other populations” (Gray and Morrison,
1974, p. 173).

Since the samples studied to date have
been ascertained through students in college or medical school, their results can
only be generalized to populations of that
sort and not to the general population of
the region. Whether the families represented form a cross-section of any general population is unknown from the published data. One would suspect that each
is biased to a different degree by this ascertainment method and might include more
persons of middle- and _ upper-class

212

backgrounds. In this connection, Rainwater (1965, p. 131) found that “concern
about the sex of children seemed to be at
its low point in the upper-middle class and
at its high point in the upper-lower class.”
If this was so in the general population of
each of the American studies, the findings
of no significant difference between the
reproductive behavior of parents having
children of the same sex and those having
prior children of both sexes would be expected a priori. The one anomalous case
from this point of view would be the sample from Vanderbilt University (Gray and
Morrison, 1974), and that anomaly might
vanish if it were shown that the sample
had included relatively more students
from lower-class families due to recently
broadened admission policies.

With these studies in mind, the primary
objective of the present investigation was
to examine the reproductive history of a
sample of persons representing a general
regional population (the Upper Midwest of
the United States or more particularly the
state of Minnesota and its neighboring
states) for an influence of combinations of
sexes of the first two to four offspring upon
ultimate (or completed) family size. A secondary objective was to investigate the
effect of social status upon concern about
the sex of the offspring, insofar as this
could be inferred from the sex composition
of completed families.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Two earlier publications (Rao et al.,
1973, and Waller et al. 1973) have discussed other aspects of a sample of 2,393
unions drawn from those in the pedigrees
published by Elizabeth W. and Sheldon
C. Reed (1965). Of this total number,
2,247 unions constituted the starting point
of the present investigation. The difference (146 couples) is due to incomplete
information for one or both spouses or for
at least one of their offspring.

Table 1 delineates the number of
couples excluded from the present study
and presents the reasons for their exclusion. The exclusions were done in the
order stated and are nonoverlapping. The
interval 1843 to 1927 for year of birth of
the adult women resulted from two considerations. At first, the upper limit was
conservatively established as the year
1917, taking into account that maternal
age of 40 years signifies the completion of
fertility for 98 per cent of the women in
this population (see Waller, 1971) and that
the bulk of the field work was completed
by the Reed group around 1957. An additional 272 families were available from
follow-up work done by the present author, completed in 1967 (see Table 2), and
which consisted of the ten-year cohort by
birth of mother between 1918 and 1927.
Examination of the published data for 73
women from the larger sample born in this
latter interval showed that the outcome of
those unions did not differ significantly
from the cohort more recently reexamined in either sex composition of the
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

offspring or in mean number of offspring.
Hence the upper limit for year of birth of
the women was raised to 1927. Since the
generation length in human populations is
approximately 25 years, it was possible to
work backward from the ten-year cohort
dates and include women born as early as
1843. The end result was three 25-year
cohorts containing 99, 319, and 400
women respectively, and one ten-year
cohort containing 375 women.

Limitation of the present study to persons having two or more children further
restricted the sample sizes to 75, 221, 258,
and 336 (see Table 3). These data were
then analyzed to shed light on the primary
question: whether the combination of
sexes in the first two to four children
influences the decision to enlarge the family. Values of the occupational and educational status of the male parent were
available for only 272 of the 336 couples in
the 1918-27 cohort. These data were examined in an attempt to meet the second
objective of the study, namely, whether
concern about the combination of sexes
among the children shows any association
with socioeconomic status.

Several nonparametric techniques were
employed in addition to the straightforward contingency table analysis of earlier
workers. Comparisons were made among
the four possible combinations of sex of
the first two children, in addition to grouping them as “same” vs. “different.” This
amounts to partitioning a 4 X 2 contingency table into three orthogonal components, each with a single degree of freedom. This partitioning ultilized adjustment for the variance of the column
sums, as described by Li (1961, pp. 9597). Analysis for differences among
cohorts, combinations in the first two children, and outcomes (Table 7) employed a
three-way multiple chi-square technique.
The Fortran program MCHISQ developed by the Learning Research and

Sex of Children and Ultimate Family Size

213

Development Center of the University of
Pittsburgh was used in this comparison.
For certain 2 X 2 tables Fisher’s Exact
Test was used, owing its use to small
numbers in one or more cells. For this test,
the Fortran program FEXACT (Sokal
and Rohlf, 1969) was modified by the
present author for use in time-sharing
mode on the PDP-10 computer of the University of Pittsburgh.

Probabilities of the values of chi-square
were calculated using Jaspen’s approximation (Jaspen, 1965) where noted; otherwise, they were obtained by use of the
Monroe 1770 desk calculator. This last
method was possible only where the degrees of freedom equaled one and took
advantage of the fact that y,? d.f. = 27.
Hence one can take the square root of the
chi-square value and use the Monroe
1770’s_ preprogrammed calculation of
areas under the unit normal curve to find
the probability of the given chi-square
value.

RESULTS

Taken together, the data of Tables 2
and 3 serve to characterize this sample
more specifically. In Table 3, the data
show a sharp decline in mean number of
offspring for “all families” between the
first and second cohort, no significant difference between the second and third, and
a rise between the third and fourth. This
last cohort includes women whose fertility
was completed in the years after World
War IT. While the number in that cohort
of this study is very small, the data at
hand are at least consistent with national
trends (Campbell, 1973). The distributions
of numbers of offspring (Table 2) show
that the observed changes in means (Table
3) were produced by a combination of decreasing proportions of childless women
and decreasing proportions of families
having six or more children. All of these
means are higher than would be the naDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

* The first four cohorts, from 1843 through 1927, are members of the sample described in Table 1, the fifth cohort, 1918-1927, represents
families in which the father’s occupation and education were known (from sample of Waller, 1971)

tional norm for these cohorts, due to the
region and time period from which they
were sampled (see Reed and Reed, 1965,
pp. 50 and 51).

The sex ratio data presented in Table 4
describe the experience of the parents in
these four cohorts. Again, due to small
sample sizes, the standard errors of the
proportions are large and thus any inference about the effects of birth order upon
sex is precluded. Even for the category

“All Births,” none of the observed proportions deviates significantly from a population expectation of 106/100 for the secondary sex ratio.

The data presented in Table 5 are consistent with the hypothesis that there is no
significant effect of sex composition upon
increase in size of family across all four
cohorts and considering the first two,
three, or four children. Proceeding from
the two-child cases to the four-child case

in each cohort, the total number of
families increasing should equal the total
number of families in the next comparison. That they do not is due to the deliberate omission of cases in which the third
or subsequent birth was either a multiple
birth, a retarded person, or an infant
death. One example may suffice to illustrate this point. Examination of the data
for the cohort 1918-27 shows that 247
families had more than two children; yet
only 244 were included in the next comparison. Of the 157 having more than
three children, only 152 qualified for inclusion in the third comparison. Hence in
the first case three were omitted, and in
the next case five were omitted.

By partitioning the total chi-square
value for the dichotomy “Stop vs. Increase” by four combinations of sexes
among the first two offspring, it is possible
to examine three orthogonal comparisons.
In addition to testing the “Same vs. Different” dichotomy among combinations,
one may test two further hypotheses: (1)
that there is no difference in proportion
increasing when the first two were both
male (BB) as compared with both females
(GG); and (2) that in families having both
sexes represented in the first two, the

proportion increasing was no different
whether the male was the first-born (BG)
or the female was the first (GB). The data
in Table 6 show a difference under Hypothesis 1 for the second and fourth
cohorts, reaching a low level of probability
(o = 0.034) only for the most recent
(fourth) cohort. In this latter case, the difference could be interpreted as “desire for
a girl.” We fail to reject Hypothesis 2 for
any of the cohorts studied; the inference is
that there is no influence of order of the
first two upon increasing the number of
offspring.

Omitting the first cohort (C1) solely because of its small sample size (V = 75)
leads to comparisons among the remaining
three, which may be thought of as three
generations of families. These three are
designated C2, C3, and C4 in Table 7, a
multiple chi-square analysis. The hypothesis of independence of cohort and outcome is rejected (» = 0.0080). This low
probability value for the overall comparison is attributable to the fact that the most
recent cohort (C4) is different in the portion increasing across all combinations of
the sex of the first two (6 = 0.0031). This
difference is also reflected in the comparison of mean family size alluded to above

one even approaches the 0.10 probability

Complete information for calculating
the Hollingshead Two-Factor Index of Social Position was available for 272 families
(see Table 2); however, five of these

families were omitted from Table 8 because there were twins as first or second
births. In the comparison of proportion of
families increasing for “Same vs. Different,” examination of the data for the middle and lower classes shows a suggestive
reversal of preference. Insofar as these
proportions indicate a “concern” about the
sex composition of the family, it appears
that whereas there is no significant effect

in the data for the middle class, there is a
marked tendency for lower-class couples
to have additional children beyond two
after having two of the same sex. Subdivision of the lower class into SES IV (ISP
scores of 48 to 63) and SES V (ISP scores
of 64 to 77) leaves only 15 families in the
lowest group. In SES IV, the 22 table of
“Same vs. Different” by “Stop vs. Increase” for 71 families yields a probability
of 0.055 for Fisher’s Exact Test (twotailed). This result is consonant with
Rainwater’s (1965) suggestion cited above.

Table 9 contains the results of a multiple chi-square test of independence among
social class, sex of first two children, and
outcome (decision to increase family size
or stop). From this table it can be seen that
the lack of independence between social
class and outcome (f = 0.027) is accounted
for by the single degree of freedom contrast between the middle and lower
classes. The interaction term has a low
probability of occurring by chance alone (p
= 0.071), and the overall hypothesis of
independence of social class, outcome, and
combination of sexes in the first two can be
rejected at the 0.05 level.

Beyond the question of statistical significance of the association between sex of
the first two offspring and the observed
dichotomy “Stopped vs. Increase,” is the

3. The familiar phi coefficient which
takes on values from zero when no association exists to +1.0 when there is perfect
association, and which is one means of
adjusting for the sensitivity of chi-square
values to inflated sample sizes. The values
of chi-square in Table 10 upon which the
calculations of @ are based are not corrected for continuity, so that

b= y,7/N.

The standard error of @ for large N is
approximately 1//N.

In addition, Table 10 presents the uncorrected chi-square values and their associated probabilities.

From these summary statistics, it is apparent that only three samples have shown
a statistically significant association between the sex of the first two offspring and
the procreation of additional children.
These samples are the data of Thomas
(1951), Population 3 of Gray and Morrison
(1974), and the lower-class sample of the
1918-27 cohort of the present investigation.

DISCUSSION

There are at least three aspects of the
question of the influence of the sex of prior
offspring upon the parental decision to
augment the number of children that are
raised by all these investigations (the
present study included):

1. Was the sample representative of any
specific population?

2. What was the result of combining contingency tables whose marginal frequencies were unequal?

Sex of Children and Ultimate Family Size

221

3. What sample size would be required to be
relatively certain of recognizing a statistically significant difference, say, of 12 per
cent as found by Thomas (1951) ata =
0.05?

With regard to the first question, the
families ascertained were related to students in all the studies except the present
one. This relationship may have biased
the results toward a lack of association, so
that a conservative evaluation of the results of previous investigations might be
phrased thus: “There appear to be geographic differences in the observed
influence of the sex combinations in the
first two offspring upon the ultimate number of children produced by families who
had at least one child whose educational
level was at the first year of college or
beyond. Even where a statistically significant association was found, the degree
of association was not great, as indicated
by calculated values of the odds ratio, the
log of the odds, or the fourfold point correlation (@ coefficient).” The present investigation is in agreement with all the American studies except Population 3 of Gray
and Morrison (1974) in finding no association, but does suggest that the classification of families by the occupation and education of the male parent may reveal a
difference associated with class membership.

Secondly, the inflation of chi-square by
increasing the sample size through combining two contingency tables (Gray,
1972) merely forces significance and is not
valid unless the marginals have nearly
equal mean and variance. In the two
samples under discussion, the means (Vp)
were different (286 vs. 105) and so were
the variances Npg (167.5 vs. 78.4). One
valid method for combining the evidence
from these two tables is to use the appropriate L, and w, from Table 10 to evaluate
the homogeneity of the two data sets
(x7homog) and if they are not significantly
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

222

heterogeneous, to evaluate the association
present in the two data sets (x7 assoc). Following the procedure outlined in Fleiss
(1973, pp. 115-117), we find that y*nomog
= 0.125 (d.f. = 1, = 0.72) and since the
data sets are thus not significantly heterogeneous, we calculate x7assoe = 4.503
(d.f. = 1, p = 0.03). The mean log of the
odds for these data (L ‘Yis 0.271, or in more
familiar terms the mean odds ratio (0’) is
1.31, with an associated standard error of
0.167. Thus, for the combined sample,
there is significant association between sex
combination in prior children and the observed increase of number of offspring to
more than two, and it appears that parents
having two children of the same sex are
(approximately) 1.3 times as likely to increase their number of offspring, when
compared to parents having one boy and
one girl.

The third general question also relates
to statistical considerations. Suppose that
an investigator wants to detect a difference in the proportion increasing that is
equal to 0.12 (approximately that found by
Thomas). Further, suppose that he will be
satisfied with a Type I error of 0.05, and
wants to be 80 per cent certain of detecting
a difference at that level if one exists.
What sample size is necessary, given Ap =
0.12, a = 0.05, and B = 0.20? If he specifies the two proportions that result in this
difference, he can calculate the number
needed from published tables or from
mathematical formulas. One small table in
Sokal and Rohlf’s text Biometry (1969) enables us to specify the requisite sample size
using the proportion of families increasing
and having two different-sex prior offspring from Thomas (1951), a value of
0.72. The appropriate sample size is 193
per group.

Interestingly enough, Thomas observed
259 families whose first two children were
of the same sex, and 211 families whose
first two were of different sex. Hence our

Waller

 

Social Biology

hypothetical investigator would accept the
difference observed as a “real” one, given
the above stipulations.

Given the observed values for Population 3 of Gray and Morrison, and stipulating that a = 0.05 and 8 = 0.20, the required sample size for the stated difference
of 0.172 is 178 per group. Their numbers
of cases are 213 for families with same sex
first two and 207 with different sex first
two. This difference then satisfies all our
criteria, and we can reject the hypothesis
of no difference in proportion increasing (p
< 0.001, see Table 10).

The remaining group showing a statistically significant association is the lower
class of the 1918-27 cohort of the present
study, in which 0.9070 (90.7 per cent) of
families with same-sex first two increased,
as opposed to 0.7442 (74.4 per cent) of
families with different-sex first two. Although the chi-square value is significant
(vy? = 3.957, d.f. = 1, p = 0.046), the
sample size is small. This result gives rise
to the question of what risk there is of
accepting the false null hypothesis of no
difference. The value of 8 for these data
hes between 0.50 and 0.55, and if we were
to hold to our requirement that B = 0.20,
the required sample size for this magnitude of difference in proportion is 81
families per group. On this basis, the observation is merely suggestive and by no
means definitive, even though it is consistent with the observation of Rainwater
(1965) that “concern about the sex of children seemed to be... at its high point in
the upper-lower class.”

Examination of the data of the present
study presented in Tables 3 and 6 suggests
a relationship between ultimate family size
(in families having two or more children)
and the influence of sex of the first two
offspring upon the augmentation of the
number of children. The association in the
fourfold tables (Same vs. Different by Stop
vs. Increase) for the four cohorts, as indi
 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

Vol. 23, No. 3

cated by the p levels for these tables, appears to be stronger when mean family
size is smaller. In this respect, the samples
of the present study resemble those of
Gray and Morrison (1974).

The speculation that parents who intend to limit their family size are more
concerned about the sex composition of
their offspring is invited by this kind of
data, but the evidence of studies done to
date is contradictory. Ayala and Falk
(1971), for example, failed to find any
influence of the sex of the two prior children upon increase of family size in a
group of families having a mean family
size of 3.09 children. In all the above
cases, the families studied had two or
more children, but as the data of Tables 2
and 3 show, the decline in mean family
size for those with two or more children
parallels that for the total adult sample in
each case. This decline is accompanied by
an increase in the proportion of nonreproducing adults from 0.10 (1843-67)
through 0.15 (1869-92) to 0.19 (1893-~
1917). These factors parallel the general
experience of U.S. women for this time
period (Campbell, 1973). The fourth
cohort shows arise in mean family size for
the 73 families ascertained in the present
investigation (Table 3), and this too is
similar to the reproductive behavior of the
general population. These are the parents
who contributed to the “baby boom” after
World War II.

Gray and Morrison (1974) examined
their data for an effect of sex composition
of the first three and first four children
upon the increase in family size and found
that in Populations 1 and 2 the largest
difference in proportion increasing occurred after the third child, whereas in
Population 3 a large difference was apparent after the second child. Hence they concluded that the desire that parents have
for children of both sexes “becomes a
measurable force after two children in

Sex of Children and Ultimate Family Size

223

some populations and after three children
in other populations” (p. 173). Table 5
presents similar data from the families of
this study. The earliest cohort (1843-67)
shows a marked difference in proportion
increasing after four children of the same
sex, even though the sample size is too
small for the comparison to reach statistical significance. In contrast, the next
cohort (1868-92) shows the effect after two
children, but not after three or four. The
1893—1917 cohort shows a difference in
proportion increasing after three children,
but in the opposite direction and only at p
= 0.09; this same direction of difference is
also seen at this point in the two earlier
cohorts. The most recent group, which is
probably comparable in span of reproduction to the other American studies, shows
a consistent and increasing difference in
proportion after the second, third, and
fourth. The probabilities stated in this
table are all from Fisher’s Exact Test and
are appropriate for one-tailed tests of hypotheses; their values are consistent with
but are not expected to be identical to the
chi-square values of Table 6, since chisquare is two-tailed.

Returning to the consideration of the sex
of the first two children, the partition of
the total chi-square values into single
degree-of-freedom contrasts is shown in
Table 6. While generalization of these results is limited due to the smal! number of
families observed, these data show some
interesting differences that may reflect
changes in preference over time. The contrasts with the lowest probabilities of occurring by chance alone are: (1) in the
1843-67 cohort, the contrast between
families with two boys vs. two girls; (2) in
the 1868-92 cohort, the contrast between
families with the first two of the same sex
(whether male or female) vs. those with
children of different sex; (3) in the 1893—
1917 cohort, the same as in Cohort 2
(1868-92), but with much smaller differDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

224.

ences in each subdivision; (4) in the total
1918~27 cohort, the same as in Cohort 1
(1843-67), and with the lowest probability
of any of the tabulated contrasts.

Were these differences to be true in
larger samples from the same time periods, one might make the inference that the
strength of preference for a combination of
boys and girls among the offspring has
varied over time, reaching a high point
among those families in the 1868-92
cohort. Considering those families who
have two children of the same sex as the
first two, there appears to have been a
switch in preference from the second
through fourth cohorts, from “desire for a
boy” through no difference to “desire for a
girl.” In those families who already had a
child of each sex, one might infer a similar
change in the same time period, from “desire for another boy” to “desire for another
girl.”

Analysis of the above data (Table 6) can
be summarized by the statistical technique
of a multiple chi-square analysis of the
categories. In Table 7 are presented the
tests for independence of Cohort and Outcome, with the first cohort excluded because its small numbers (and one cell with
a value of zero) would lead to inflated
values for the chi-square statistic. Here it
can be seen that the difference in “preference” evident from Table 6 leads to rejection of the hypothesis of independence of
Cohort and Outcome at a statistically
highly significant level. Within this comparison are two orthogonal contrasts, from
which it is evident that data for the most
recent cohort give rise to this rejection.
Another look at Table 6 shows that this in
turn results from the small difference in
percentage of families increasing in the
“same vs. different” contrast, as compared
with that contrast in the two earlier
cohorts. None of the other components of
the multiple chi-square analysis are statistically significant.

Waller

Social Biology

In much the same way that Table 7
summarizes Table 6, Table 9 summarizes
Table 8. The statistically significant lack
of independence between social class
(SES) and outcome seen in Table 9 arises
mainly from the difference in direction
and magnitude of the last contrast in
Table 8 across these three broad social
classes. It is this contrast in reproductive
behavior that has been described above as
“suggestive” due to the relatively small
number of families in each group. This
difference, and in fact the analysis by social class of the effect of the combinations
of sexes among offspring upon ultimate
family size, merits replication in other
places.

Finally, Table 10 is designed to present
a summary of the data from five earlier
studies and from the present study in
terms of three indices of association and
shows that on the whole there is little
influence of the combinations of sexes in
the first two children. Although three
groups give evidence of some influence,
that influence appears from the association
statistics to be relatively small even when
present. For example, the phi coefficient
() for the study of Thomas (1951) is only
0.142; for Population 3 of Gray and Morrison (1974), it is 0.183; and for the lower
social class in the present study, it is
higher, but still only 0.214. The weights
(w) given in Table 10 may be used in
combining the natural logarithm of the
odds ratio (where this is deemed appropriate) to obtain both an average value for L’
and a test of significance of the degree of
association. This particular weight, the
reciprocal of the squared standard error,
equals S(1/o?) and thus utilizes the fact
that there is more information in a larger
sample. This technique was used above to
demonstrate the proper method of combining the sample of Loyd and Gray (1969)
with the additional data collected by Gray
(1972).

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The observed data from five earlier
studies and the present investigation of the
influence of the sex combinations of prior
children upon the ultimate (or completed)
number of children in the family are presented. Data from all sources are discussed
in terms of three measures of association:
the corrected odds ratio (0’), the natural
logarithm of this ratio (L'), and the phi
coefficient @) or fourfold point correla~
tion,

The present study draws upon data
from the pedigrees of Reed and Reed
(1965), deleting families with multiparous
births and families with retarded children
or parents. The exclusions are outlined in
detail] and result in a sample of persons
claimed to be representative of a general
Upper Midwest population, broken down
by three twenty-five year cohorts and one
ten-year cohort by year of birth of the
female (1843-67, 1868-92, 1893-1917,
1918-27).

In addition to the observation of earlier
investigators that the influence of combinations of sexes in the first two children

Sex of Children and Ultimate Family Size

225

differs by geographic area, it is shown that
a difference has occurred in a single region
over time; and the data for the most recent
cohort suggest an effect of social class as
well. Taken together, all the statistical
techniques used point to a small magnitude of the influence studied even when
present at a statistically significant level.

Notes on sample size relative to levels of
qa and # are included, as is a discussion of
a valid method of combining contingency
tables.

An earlier verion of this paper was presented
at the Behavior Genetics Association Meeting
in Minneapolis (1974). The present extensive
revision was made possible through the work
of Drs. Sheldon and Elizabeth Reed and their
daughter Catherine, who worked together verifying the birth order information and recording the year of birth of each adult. The author
wishes to thank them very much for that vital
contribution.

This investigation was supported in part by
NIEHS grant No. 5T01ES00117-07, and by
the General Research Support Grant to the
University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of
Public Health.
