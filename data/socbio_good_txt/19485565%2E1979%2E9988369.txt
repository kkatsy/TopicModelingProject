ABSTRACT: A main purpose of monitoring human germinal mutations is to detect environmental
predisposing factors of public health concern. At least in principle, three general types may be investigated: specific locus mutations, structural chromosome rearrangements, and numerical
chromosome abnormalities. Two different methodological approaches may be distinguished: (1)
systematic and ad hoc studies of reproductive outcomes in a defined population of women; (2) opportunistic use of data already collected for other purposes. An unresolved ambiguity in the
definition of specific locus and chromosomal germinal mutation rates in human populations is that
such are defined as being rates of events “per gamete”’ but at present are only studied in the resulting

organism which has survived to the time of recognition of the mutation.

The goal of monitoring human mutations is to detect the introduction or unsuspected rise in mutagens in the human environment. A main concern is whether the
recent apparent increase in some environmental pollutants is associated with an increase in human mutation rates, a question very difficult to answer because of
lack of good historical base-line data for
many consequences of mutational events.
In fact, with the exception of Down’s syndrome and perhaps a few other outcomes
associated with mutation, it may not be
feasible to determine if current rates are
higher than those in the past. It may only
be feasible to address the question “‘prospectively,” i.e., to investigate whether
future increases in unsuspected environmental hazards will be associated with increases in human mutation rates.

This general goal is much easier to
specify than to achieve. In general, human
mutations are rare and often involve cryptic outcomes that make ascertainment

difficult and of uncertain completeness.
This often results in imprecision in
measures of mutation rates and makes it
difficult to investigate either short- or
long-term suspected temporal changes in
most mutagenic outcomes. Moreover,
even if an apparent rise in any type of mutation rate is identified, the search for extrinsic explanation may well be unproductive, leaving only the vague and
unsatisfactory explanation of ‘‘unexplained artifacts” or chance occurrence of
events of putative low probability as alternative explanations to an environmental etiology. These problems will be illustrated below.

Of the two main categories of mutational events, germinal cell and somatic
cell, this discussion will be restricted to the
former. At the present time, investigation
of somatic cell mutagenesis in humans in
numbers adequate for purposes of population surveillance is feasible only for study
of chromosome damage, although in the

near future advances in investigation of
hemoglobin variants (e.g., Stammatoyannopoulos, in press) and possibly of unscheduled DNA synthesis (Painter, 1970)
or other systems for determination of
direct damage to DNA may make these
latter methods also useful. (A review of
somatic mutation monitoring will appear
elsewhere [Hook, in press)]).

At least three types of germinal mutations may be distinguished: (1) specific locus mutations involving structural or regulatory genes which may associate with
disorders segregating as Mendelian traits;
(2) chromosomal mutations, which may
involve gain or loss of chromosomes (numerical aneuploidy), or structural chromosome rearrangements such as translocations; and (3) mutations in nonchromosomal genetic structures such
as mitochondria and other extranuclear
particles.

Knowledge of the effects of nonchromosomal variants is based on work in
lower organisms (e.g., Preer, 1971). Although cytoplasmic inheritance has been
Suggested as being of significance in humans with regard to symmelia (Nance et
al., 1969) and other conditions (Nance,
1969, 1971), there is at present no practical method for monitoring for effects of
mutations in these or other extranuclear
structures in human populations, and this
category will not be considered further
here.

MUTATION RATES AND
PROBLEMS IN THEIR DEFINITION

Specific locus mutations rates for a variety of human diseases have been investigated. Order of magnitude estimates for
eight disorders ranging from the most frequent to relatively infrequent are as follows: neurofibromatosis, 0.5-1 x 10°;
Apert’s syndrome (acrocephalosyndactyly) 3.5 x 10°; polycystic kidney disease,

Human Germinal Mutations 105

1x 10°; tuberous sclerosis, 1 x 10°;-achondroplastic dwarfism, 1 x 10°; Hemophilia
A, 3—6 x 10°; aniridia, 3 x 10°; and VonHippel Lindau disease, 2 x 107. (Rates are
summarized from review by Vogel and
Rathenberg, 1975.) These rates are ‘“‘per
gamete.” Thus, for autosomal dominant
conditions, the rate of affected individuals
as a result of a new mutation (or more accurately, of live births who carry a new
mutant gene) is twice the rate of mutation.
(For hemophilia and other X-linked [recessive] traits, the rate of de novo cases in
males equals the mutation rate in females,
and the rate of de novo carriers in females
is equal to the sum of the mutation rates in
males and females.)

There is uncertainty as to the average
or median specific locus mutation rate in
conditions investigated directly (Vogel
and Rathenberg, 1975), but it would appear to be somewhere between 10° and 10°
per locus per gamete. Certainly, as noted
above, there appears to be considerable
variation in rates {over at least three orders of magnitude). Moreover, there is a
plausible suspicion that the specific locus
mutations associated with diseases whose
rates have been investigated are not representative. An ascertainment bias appears
likely because geneticists would tend to
study the more frequent disorders. For
this reason, the ‘“‘true’’? median and/or
average mutation rate may be closer to 10°
to 107 per locus. But there may also be
reasons for underestimates at the loci already examined. It is possible that mutations to alleles with very severe phenotypic expression result in fetal death and will
be overlooked; and, of course, mutations
to alleles which involve only minor
changes in nucleotide sequence will not be
evident.

Indirect estimates of average mutation
rates have been made in several studies. In
isolated South American Indian tribes,
Neel (1973) suggested a rate of 6-8 x 10°
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

106 Hook

per locus. Later, with somewhat different
methods and estimates limited to electrophoretically detectable and presumably neutral variants, an estimate of 7 x 10°
per locus was reached (Neel and
Thompson, 1977) and subsequently, with
a different approach, 1.6 x 10° per locus
(Neel and Rothman, 1978). The latter two
estimates are of course only for the limited
class of allelic variants detectable at the
loci investigated. Both of these estimates,
and those of others using somewhat similar methods (Nei, 1977; Chakraborty and
Roychoudbury, 1978), depend critically
on the authors’ assumptions concerning
phenotypic “‘neutrality” of the variants,
their equilibrium in the population, and
the present and historical structure of the
populations involved. How plausible the
assumptions are and how robust the estimates are to deviations in these assumptions remain uncertain.

It appears likely that there is at least a
sex difference in mutation rates for some
conditions (Vogel, 1977) with a higher
mutation rate in male germ cells for Hemophilia A and, it appears likely, also for
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (Francke et al.,
1976, Francke et al., 1977; see also Morton and Lalouel, 1977).

With the exception of sex and of paternal age (Jones et al., 1975; Vogel and
Rathenberg, 1975), there is no evidence
documenting association of human
specific locus mutations with any biologic
or environmental factors. However, the
initial trends in the Hiroshima-Nagasaki
observations and observations on experimental animals (Green, 1968; Russell,
1972) make it very likely that ionizing irradiation and chemicals with radiomimetic
phenotypic effects are mutagenic in humans.

The mutation rate for numerical chromosomal abnormalities varies considerably with the chromosome involved and

Social Biology

also, at least as far as it can be measured,
the stage of life in which the mutation is
detected. In live births, the most frequent
chromosome abnormalities and their approximate rates are 47,+21 (1 x 10°), extra X (1 x 10%), extra Y in males (1 x 10°),
47, + 18(1x 10%), 47, + 13(1x0.5x 10%),
and XO (about 1 x 10°). The others are extremely rare, probably somewhere between 10° and 10°. The total frequency of
numerical chromosome abnormalities 1s
about three to four per thousand live
births (Hook and Hamerton, 1976). On
the other hand, in studies of spontaneous
abortuses in early gestation, the frequency
is higher, about 40 to 50 per cent (Carr and
Gedeon, 1977), about half of which are
trisomies.

The rates of structural chromosome
rearrangements in live births may be calculated as about 5-6 x 10“ for unbalanced
rearrangements and 20 x 10% for balanced
rearrangements (Hook and Hamerton,
1977), but many of these are inherited
from a carrier patient. Jacobs (1977) has
estimated the mutation rate for all structural chromosomal rearrangements that
are unbalanced as 1.1 x 10% and for those
in the balanced category as 1.78 x 10%.

Maternal age has a strong association
with 47, +21 Down’s syndrome, 47,+ 18,
and 47,+13, as has been documented by
many Observers. Weaker associations
with maternal age are observed for the occurrence of extra X chromosomes
(Carothers et al., 1978). There may be a
paternal age effect for an absent sex chromosome in humans, though there is no
consistent evidence for a parental age
effect of significant magnitude for XYY
genotype for structural rearrangements.
These inferences are based on reports on
live births, but available data on still births
and earlier fetal deaths suggest the same
inferences hold here for the genotypes
mentioned. Of interest, however, is the

Vol. 26, No. 2

fact that 47,+16, an embryonic lethal,
shows no maternal age effect (Hassold et
al., 1978).

Numerous associations of other biological, social, and environmental factors
with chromosome abnormalities, in particular with Down’s syndrome, have been
proposed (see Cohen et al. 1977). Perhaps
the most suggestive are those for radiation
(Uchida, 1977), although it must be emphasized, particularly in view of the work
of Cohen et al. (1977), that the evidence
is still not conclusive.

As the discussion of chromosome trisomies implies, there is an unresolved ambiguity in definition of mutation rates in human populations. These are defined as
being a rate of events per gamete per
generation. The difficulty is that a mutational event in the gamete is not ascertained directly but indirectly through
study of the organism that results, and
moreover, almost always of an organism
that survives to live birth. Mutational outcomes associated with fetal death are
difficult to investigate. This provokes
problems in interpreting changes in
measured mutation rates. Consider, for
example, a hypothetical agent, perhaps a
hormone or drug, that enables survival to
live birth of mutant fetuses that otherwise
would have died in utero. This agent will
increase the mutation rate as usually
measured, i.e., in live births, but may
have no effect upon cellular genetic material. Such an agent is a mutagen in an
operational sense, in terms of measured
outcomes in live births, but not in a functional sense. One may attempt to avoid
this difficulty by systematically collecting
information on mutation in fetal deaths as
well as in live births; but unless all products of conception are examined—an almost impossible task because many spontaneous fetal deaths occur before
pregnancy is recognized—the possibility

 

Human Germinal Mutations 107

remains that changes in rates in events
monitored in any surveillance scheme may
reflect only changes in differential survival
to a particular gestational stage of those
affected.

Perhaps recent discoveries concerning
the sperm, for example, that the HLA
phenotype of a single sperm may reflect its
(haploid) genotype (Arnaiz-Villena and
Festenstein, 1976; see also Boettcher,
1977) or that the sperm chromosomal
complement may be directly assayed (Rudak et al., 1978), will allow direct investigation of mutation rates in at least male
gametes without the possibility of this type
of confounding.

This problem with the definition of rates of mutagenic outcomes may not be a
major practical impediment to actual surveillance and monitoring of rates, but it
may render difficult the interpretation of
changes.

MONITORING MUTATIONS:
APPROACHES

With regard to logistics of surveillance
of the population for changes in mutation
rates, there are two different general approaches. One might be termed the direct
or “brute force” approach: to identify a
defined population of live births in some
particular jurisdiction and search for as
many possible mutagenic outcomes as
possible in these offspring, examining the
parents if necessary to exclude the heritable origin of the detected variants. Neel
has been the main proponent of this approach, at least with regard to specific locus mutations, and is now conducting a pilot project in Ann Arbor (Neel et al., in
press). Since the estimate of the average
detectable mutation rate at loci studied
may be, as already discussed, somewhere
between 10° to 10” per gamete, that is,
somewhere between one mutation in

108 Hook

50,000 and one in 5,000,000 live births, we
need a very large number of genetic systems in order to expect to detect any
significant change in base-line mutation
rates by this method. It is hoped, however, that automated methods that allow
simultaneous determination of biochemical variants at many different loci will
make this a practical method (Neel et al.,
in press).

Other possible approaches of this type
involve direct cytogenetic examination of
live births and/or of spontaneously lost
embryos and fetuses. At least for outcomes associated with numerical aneuploidy, a mutation rather than an inherited anomaly can almost always be
presumed, making parental chromosome
examination usually unnecessary. (The
exception concerns the possibility of
parental mosaicism, but even if the
parents’ bloods are studied, gonadal mosaicism cannot be excluded.) Investigation of spontaneously aborted embryos is
particularly likely to be productive compared to the study of live births, because
the proportion of cytogenetic abnormalities is so high (Stein and Susser, 1978; Jacobs, 1978). But, as already discussed,
there 1s a methodological problem in the
study of abortuses because of the possibility of the ‘“‘shifting denominator’’ in
definition of rates. For example, very
early abortuses may be acquired for examination differentially over the course of
study or agents may affect fetal survival
and not the mutation rate.

The main difficulty with these direct
methods, both for specific locus mutations
and for chromosomal abnormalities, is
likely to be their cost. Perhaps other
methods that involve already existing data
resources or cheaper alternative approaches to data collection may be utilized
for population mutation monitoring. Such
approaches, which may be termed “opportunistic,’”’ may perhaps achieve the

Social Biology

same public health goals but with less cost
and effort. Such an opportunistic approach to surveillance of increased mutation rates may involve outcomes discussed
above that are known to be consequences
of a mutagenic process, and thus “‘direct”’
markers of a germinal mutation, or they
may involve outcomes which are less
directly related to mutational events, i.e.,
“indirect” markers.

Indirect markers include sex ratio, asymmetry (Schnull and Smith, 1974), total
fetal wastage, what some have regarded as
the analogue of ‘dominant lethals” in experimental animals, and some malignancies. Indirect markers are less ‘‘specific”’
as indicators of mutational events than
direct markers (see Hook, 1978a, for
further discussion of specific direct and indirect markers).

All of the considerations I have enumerated apply implicitly to human populations, but it should be noted that another
type of indirect surveillance is possible using lower organisms who share our environment. Examination of these organisms may reveal the effect of a putative
increase in mutagens as well. For example, of the mammals, urban rodents and
feral cats live in close proximity to human
populations and thus are likely to share
exposure to some pollutants. Most communities have programs for controlling
these species so that large scale sampling
should not prove a problem. Sampling
wild bird and fish populations also should
not prove logistically difficult, although
the applicability of inferences from observations in these submammalian organisms
to humans will always remain moot. But
with any wild species of lower organisms
there are two main problems over and
above the question of adequate numbers.
The first relates to the obvious difficulties
in studying parents of animals with observed variants. This is necessary, of
course, because any observed variant may

autosomal aneuploidy. An autosomal trisomy, for example, is presumptive evidence for a new mutation. But even if animal population cytogenetic studies are
feasible, the mortality and morbidity associated with autosomal chromosomal aberrations may make it very difficult to ascertain the affected animal before it dies.

Perhaps use of “domestic” animals,
e.g., caged mouse populations, may avoid
some of these problems, although the
scale and cost of study required would be
considerable.

EVALUATION OF MARKERS
FOR MUTATION

For the many markers that have been
mentioned, there are three general criteria that may be used in their evaluation:
their sensitivity to mutagenic agents, their
specificity of response to mutagens, and
most significantly, their cost-effectiveness
ratios.

It may be helpful if the framework that
epidemiologists have developed for evalu
ating diagnostic tests is modified and applied to qualitative evaluation of the utility of markers. In one sense, of course, the
study markers are a type of “diagnostic
test” that may be applied to a human population (or for the ‘‘body politic’’) to determine if there is an increase in mutations, and thus presumably in mutagens in
the environment. Thus, false positives are
false alerts, and false negatives represent
missed episodes. Specificity is a function
of the true negatives; sensitivity, of the
true positives (see Table 1).

Direct markers are of course sensitive
in a “‘narrow’’ sense to agents that induce
them. But one may inquire if they are also
sensitive in a “wide” sense to agents that
induce other types of mutations as well.
For putative indirect markers, sensitivity
is a major question that must be addressed
before it can be concluded that the marker
will be useful for monitoring. With regard
to specificity, for direct markers, artifact
aside, any increase in rate can only be due
to an increase in some mutagenic process.
But as will be noted subsequently, excluding an artifactual explanation for a putaDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

110 Hook

tive increase in a marker may be a major
difficulty. For indirect markers, the
greater the contribution of nonmutagenic
factors in any interval, the lower the
specificity of the marker.

The application of these criteria may be
illustrated by considering three different
markers.

Sex RATIO

Sex ratio in live births is an indirect
marker, but one that may be easily monitored in any population at low cost using
vital records. Evidence for its sensitivity to
mutagenic processes is provided indirectly
by observations in experimental animals
going as far back as the work of Muller in
the 1920’s, by observations in humans involving therapeutic irradiation (e.g.,
Scholte and Sobels, 1964) and at least by
the early observations in the HiroshimaNagasaki studies (Schull and Neel, 1959).

It should also be pointed out, however,
that sex ratio has not been sensitive to naturally occurring low-level increases of irradiation in humans (Freire-Maia and
Krieger, 1978) nor was evidence for an
effect reported in the later analysis of the
Hiroshima-Nagasaki data (Schull et al.,
1966). And in experimental work in mice
it has been surprisingly hard to detect the
effect of irradiation upon sex ratio that
was observed in drosophila and is predicted theoretically (Green, 1968). There
are observations, at least in female mice,
consistent with sex ratio changes in
offspring immediately after irradiation
which subsequently drop off sharply (Russell, 1965); the change is in the direction
opposite to that expected.

The main question with the utility of
sex ratio, however, is ‘‘specificity.”” There
are a great number of nonmutagenic factors that may affect sex ratio. Some factors
reported as associated positively with a
change in sex ratio at birth are primaparity, higher socioeconomic status, social

 

Social Biology

disruption associated with war, and (inconsistently) paternal age. Rural residence and legitimacy were found to exhibit such an association in early studies,
but not in more recent studies (Stern,
1973). In addition, the sex ratio is higher
in whites than in blacks.

Some rather unexpected associations
of sex ratio with gestation length and birth
weight have been reported. Sex ratio
showed a consistent diminishing trend
with increasing gestation length, from
1.29 at 29 weeks to 0.93 at 46 weeks in
white singleton live births in one study,
but a “U-shaped” association with birth
weight, from 1.21 at about 1,500 grams
down to 0.73 at 2,700 grams and then up to
1.99 at 4,300 grams in the same group
(Hoff, 1976). This paradoxical effect may
be explained in part by an interaction in
the “effects” of these two variables. Such
reported factors may of course be adjusted for in analyses in monitoring, assuming background data are available;
but the possibility of as yet undiscovered
nonmutagenic factors—for example, a
virus with differential sex effect upon fetal
survival—would confound any attempt to
interpret changes in the live birth sex ratio
as evidence for changes in mutations. And
indeed, it has recently been suggested on
the basis of Australia antigen studies that
Hepatitis B is just such an agent, and that
it has some male-specific tissue antigen
which results in a parental host immunologic reaction that affects sex ratio (Anonymous, 1978; Drew et al., 1978). Thus,
while changes in sex ratio may be inexpensive to monitor and may indicate trends of
public health significance, the utility of the
sex ratio as a marker of changes in environmental mutagens is questionable.

HEMOGLOBIN VARIANTS

An opportunistic method for monitoring for specific locus mutations at the
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

Vol. 26, No. 2

Hemoglobin «@ and 8 loci in live births
arises in states such as New York which
are currently analyzing samples of peripheral blood from all live births to detect
sickle cell disease.

Not only are affected individuals detected in such surveys, but also, incidentally, individuals with rare o and 8 variants, some of which may be the result of
fresh mutations. (Fetal hemoglobin variants involving alleles at the y locus will
also be detected in such a program, but establishing that these are mutations will be
difficult because of problems in determining parental phenotype.) Unfortunately,
there are only about 250,000 live births in
New York State and not all variants are
detected. Moreover, in the Albany region, two sets of bands on each membrane
are run in the initial screening which restricts the class of electrophoretically detectable variants. In addition, the followup necessary to confirm any variant and
determine ifit is inherited or the result ofa
fresh mutation is frequently difficult. The
mutation rates at the a and 6 loci are unknown at the present, so it is not clear
what population size is necessary to detect
a doubling of rate at any specified level of
Type 1 and Type 2 error. But certainly the
potential for an opportunistic approach to
monitoring exists in such a program, if not
in the experience in a single state, then at
least in the combined experience of
several states in the nation.

Such monitoring is very likely to be
“specific” in the sense that any increase in
de novo variants, artifacts aside, will be
due to increased mutations. But if there is
a putative increase in hemoglobin variants
in a population, excluding artifacts or
chance may in fact not be trivial. As already discussed, the method is sensitive in
the “narrow sense” to mutagens and probably also in the “wide sense,” at least for
agents inducing other specific locus mutations.

Human Germinal Mutations 111

INTERCHANGE TRISOMIES:
THE Ratio METHOD

The third system, of many that might
be discussed, I will treat in some detail because this illustrates some issues concerned with the follow-up of monitoring.

This approach involves indirect analysis of the rates of mutation resulting in de
novo translocation-21 cases of Down’s
syndrome, a genotype associated with 46
chromosomes. The actual variable
screened is the ratio of such de novo cases
to the number of cases with the 47,+21
genotype. These two genotypes have
identical phenotypes. The experience of
laboratories, clinics, and registries may be
analyzed without the need to define the
‘“‘completeness”’ of these sources. The value of the ratio is about 0.03 to 0.05 in most
series, but is higher (about 0.06 to 0.10) if
attention ts restricted to younger mothers,
since 47,+21 but not translocation
Down’s syndrome increases dramatically
with parental age. Because of its low value, the ratio is more sensitive to absolute
numerical changes in the numerator than
in the denominator. A change in the ratio
may of course be the result of changes in
the events scored in either the numerator
or denominator; but since the denominator includes about 95 per cent of all cases,
a change in the ratio attributable exclusively to changes in the 47,+21 group
could be detected by data from ad hoc reporting sources on the total frequency of
the Down’s syndrome phenotype, e.g., vital records or birth defect monitoring programs.

Artifacts aside, this marker for monitoring is “‘specific’’ for mutational events
in the trivial sense already discussed. It is
also “‘sensitive” in a “narrow” sense by
definition. In the “‘wide”’ sense, translocation Down’s syndrome is likely to have the
same responsivity to environmental mutagens as at least one other cytogenetic outcome—translocation Patau’s syndrome.
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

112 Hook

This condition is associated with 46 chromosomes but has a phenotype identical to
that produced by 47,+ 13. Possibly these
outcomes also share responsiveness to
mutagens with other types of chromosome
translocations and rearrangements (e.g.,
reciprocal exchanges, deletions, etc.) as
well as perhaps with some specific locus
mutations.

The cost-effectiveness ratio of this
method is relatively low if it is superimposed upon existing methods of data collection from cytogenetic laboratories such
as chromosome registries.

This method was recently applied to
data on the New York State chromosome
registry (Hook, 1978a, 1978b) (see Table
2). An increase for interchange Down’s
syndrome is apparent in 1973. Clearly this
could be attributable to a number of distorting factors—for example, greater activities of the participating laboratories in
1973 and subsequent years, more referrals
of Down’s syndrome cases for study, and
case reports from recently affiliated laboratories. The ratio method adjusts for this
possibility by dividing by the number of 47
trisomy Down’s syndrome cases reported.
As may be noted, the change in 1973 is still
evident. It is of interest that translocation
13 trisomy also shows a suggestive change
around the same time (but not exactly, see
footnote to Table 2), although the very
small numbers preclude definitive inferences here. The increase for de novo
translocation Down’s syndrome cases in
1973, however, is ‘‘statistically
significant”” (P<0.001) when the ratio of
cases born in each year starting in 1969 is
compared with the total number of cases
born in all preceding years, an inference
that remains when the level is adjusted for
the number of tests performed (Hook,
1978b.)

Previous estimates of mutation rates
for events resulting in translocation trisomic Down’s syndrome cases have been

 

Social Biology

made by Polani et al. (1965) based on a
world review of the literature and Kikuchi
et al. (1969) for the Japanese experience.
Both results are about 2.0 x 10° per gamete. A preliminary estimate of mutation
rates using methods similar to theirs for
the New York State data gave the results
shown in Table 2 (Hook and Albright,
1978, and in preparation).

The ratio method was first applied to
these data in 1976; and after the change
was noted for the year 1973, evidence for
an increase was sought in other jurisdictions. In Memphis and Portland, preliminary analyses, based on a small
amount of data, suggest there may have
been an increase in 1973. In laboratories
in Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Indianapolis, however, the available data indicate
no such trend (Hook, 1978b). Thus, if the
observed change is the result of an environmental factor, this factor was not
ubiquitous in the United States.

Considerable attention has also been
given to five possible artifacts that might
have increased the ratio: (1) changes in
frequency of affected cases in live births
because of the introduction of amniocentesis which started in the early 1970's; (2)
changes in diagnoses resulting from chromosome “banding” which also started
around this time; (3) a diminished tendency to study or report 47, +21 cases; (4)
an increased tendency to study and/or report translocation cases; and (5) a
significant unappreciated phenotypic
difference between cases with 47, +21 trisomy and de novo interchanges, and consequent changes in ascertainment in 1973
and thereafter. There are no grounds for
believing either of the first two factors cited should have had any effect on the relative number of types of Down’s syndrome
detected or reported or, for that matter,
any reason why such a hypothesized
change should have occurred abruptly in
1973. With regard to the third factor, a

$The ratio 1s lower here than 1n Jater years because in the earlier years many cases ascertained did not have family studies and thus
could not be classified as known mutants See footnote above for analyses which include such cases 1n examining trends in all cases not
known to be familial

§These caiculations take into account vartations in estimated completeness of reporting and total live births in the jurisdiction
among other variables Therefore, trends in estimated mutation rates will not parallel exactly the trends in ratios, although as may be
noted they are highly correlated

ese results are similar to observations in other studies that indicate ratios much higher for Robertsonian translocation Patau’s

syndrome than for Down’s syndrome, but this finding 1s not pertinent to the question of temporal trends in the ratios With regard to
this, the change in 1972 for Patau’s syndrome ts not as abrupt as it was for Down's syndrome Moreover, if all cases not known to be
familiar are included, then 1n 1973 the value was 2/4 not 1/4 (the only year that changes) But even including such cases, the ratio for all
cases born before 1973 1s 3/25 = 0 120 compared with a ratio of 0 400 in 1973, and of 10/49 = 0 204 for all years 1973-1977 These
trends, while not significant at the 0 05 level because of the small numbers involved, are at least consistent in a general way with those
observed for Down’s syndrome for 1973-1977 compared to 1968-1972

ute to the observed trend. This does not of
course exclude an artifactual explanation

on birth certificates reveals no evidence
for such an effect. Moreover, while this
hypothesized factor could result in a rise in
the ratio, it could not explain the absolute
rise in the numerator observed. This hypothesized artifact and the next two are in
a sense interrelated in that they depend on
the assumption of (1) some significant—
and as yet undetected—phenotypic
difference between the two genotypes and
(2) some consequent abrupt change in ascertainment for cases born in 1973. A
search has been made without result for
such a possible effect that might contrib
of the trend; but until plausible evidence
for such an artifact can be found, the data
must be regarded as prima facie evidence
for a change in mutation rate in one jurisdiction.

A search has also been made for putative associated environmental factors. Interviews of mothers of 25 cases and 25 agematched 47,+21 controls have been
carried out, but no obvious associated environmental factor has been detected. It is
hoped, however, that it will be possible to
continue this investigation with more detailed and extensive studies.

This episode illustrates some of the
practical problems that emerge in surveillance for increased mutation rates or for
that matter in monitoring for most types of
chronic disease. While some methods of
monitoring may be initiated with
difficulty, the follow-up and investigation
of the cause of a putative increase may be
even more difficult.

SUMMARY

A main purpose of monitoring human
mutations is to detect environmental predisposing factors that are of public health
concern. At least in principle, three
general types of germinal mutations may
be investigated: specific locus mutations,
structural chromosome rearrangements,
and numerical chromosome abnormalities.

Two different methodological approaches to monitoring may be distinguished. The first involves systematic and
ad hoc studies of reproductive outcomes
in a defined population of women. This
has the primary disadvantage of cost because of the low background rate of events
that are indicators of mutation. Evaluation of umbilical cord blood or material
from spontaneous or induced embryonic
and fetal deaths for biochemical and cytogenetic mutations are in this category. The
second approach involves opportunistic
use of data already collected for other purposes, or slight modifications of existing
procedures in collection of such data. Examples are (1) alteration of current mandated screening of newborns for sickle cell
anemia and other hemoglobinopathies to
investigate mutations at the a and B loci,

Social Biology

(2) evaluation of the proportion of
Down’s syndrome and Patau’s syndrome
attributable to structural chromosome
rearrangements in the experience of cytogenetic laboratories, and (3) review of the
(age-adjusted) data derived from prenatal
cytogenetic studies.

The “specificity” and “sensitivity” of
monitoring systems may be defined as if
these are “‘screening”’ tests for environmental hazards in the population at large,
and it is suggested that these variables, in
addition to cost, be the key variables in
evaluation of proposed methods. A theoretical difficulty in drawing inferences concerning the significance of any putative increase in mutation rate is that it is possible
that environmental factors may not be
mutagenic per se but rather may enhance
recognition of a mutation by postponing
the time of embryonic or fetal death of the
affected conceptus or by enabling an
affected fetus to survive to live birth. This
difficulty is related to an unresolved ambiguity in the definition of specific locus and
chromosomal germinal mutation rates in
human populations, because such are
defined as being the rate of events “‘per gamete” but are only studied at present in
the resulting organism which has survived
to the time of recognition of the mutation.
