ABSTRACT: We studied the phosphoglucomutase phenotype in relation to fertility parameters in
a consecutive series of 204 women who had delivered a normal live-born child in Rome. A highly
significant association was found between age of the women and phosphoglucomutase phenotype, suggesting a reduced rate of reproduction among women of phosphoglucomutase Type 1.
Previous spontaneous abortion appears related to both age and phosphoglucomutase enzymatic
type. An increased incidence of abortion in women of older ages was observed only in phosphoglucomutase Type 1. Gestational duration and fetal intrauterine growth rate are also significantly associated with maternal phosphoglucomutase phenotype. The pattern is complex, but
also in this instance the influence of maternal age was evident. Considered altogether, the data
suggest that phosphoglucomutase may have an important role in zygote development and

survival through the whole span of intrauterine life.

One of the most challenging problems in human reproductive biology is
to explain the very high mortality rate
at the early stages of zygote development. A mortality rate of 80 per cent
has been recently demonstrated (Diamond, 1987), and it raises many important questions. Is the loss of zygotes
due to mechanisms similar to those operating later during intrauterine and
extrauterine life, or is it due to unique
events? What is the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic
phenomena? It is possible that genomic instability (Hicks, 1987; Vogel
and Motulsky, 1986) prevails during
the early stages of development producing a great number of lethal aberrations. Recent observations point also
to genetic polymorphisms which may
be involved through a balance between
prenatal advantage and postnatal disadvantage (Dronamraiu et al., 1984;
Wadheim et al., 1986).

The understanding of such a high
embryo mortality rate may be relevant
to important clinical problems such as
infertility, habitual abortion, and in
vitro fertilization.

PHOSPHOGLUCOMUTASE GENETIC
POLYMORPHISM: PossIBLE ROLE IN
INTRAUTERINE DEVELOPMENT

Phosphoglucomutase (PGM) is an
enzyme widely distributed in nature
which catalyzes the reaction glucose-1phosphate = glucose-6-phosphate, an
essential step in carbohydrate metabolism. Four separate loci determine distinct sets of PGM isozymes: PGM,,
PGM,, PGM;, and PGM, (Spencer et
al., 1964; Hopkinson and Harris, 1968;
McAlpine et al., 1970; Cantu and
Ibarra, 1982). Placental extracts are
very rich in PGM, isozymes (Hopkinson and Harris, 1968). The PGM, locus seems to be active only during lac

tation and controls a set of isozymes

present in milk.

PGM, and PGM,; are usually polymorphic. PGM, is polymorphic only in
some populations. PGM, has been
found to be polymorphic in the population in which it was discovered
(Cantu and Ibarra, 1982).

Starch gel electrophoresis reveals

3 PGM} and PGM? at an autosomal
® (chromosome n. 1) locus (Spencer et
A al., 1964). By isoelectric focusing, the
cc existence of four alleles of PGM, and
w ten common PGM, phenotypes has
cs been demonstrated (Sutton and Bur= gess, 1978).

Studies on enzyme activity of differnent red cell PGM, phenotypes have
5 shown that the activity associated with
S the PGMj allele is about 10 per cent
© c higher than that associated with the
£ = PGM} allele (Scacchi et al., 1983).

© deviation of PGM, phenotype distribu
tion from the Hardy-Weinberg equili
brium with a decreased proportion of

heterozygotes among newborn infants.

Such deviation was not present among

adults.

In more recent studies we have
shown associations of PGM, genetic
polymorphism with spontaneous abortion and intrauterine development
both in normal and diabetic pregnancies (Nicotra et al., 1982; Bottini et al.,
1983; Bottini et al., 1985; Gloria

Bottini et al., 1986). In the present paper we have extended the sample study
of normal pregnant women and have
directed our analysis to possible relations between PGM, and fertility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLES

A consecutive sample of 204 Caucasian women, each delivering a single
live-born infant, was studied from the
population of Rome. All women had
normal pregnancies. An independent
series of 366 consecutive singleton
newborn infants from the same population was also considered.

METHODS

PGM,, was determined by starch gel
electrophoresis on red blood cell hemolysates according to Harris and
Hopkinson (1976). Cord blood was obtained at birth for newborn infants,
and venous blood in the first few days
after delivery was obtained for women.

Statistical analyses were performed
according to SPSS programs using a
UNIVAC 1100/80 computer (Nie et
al., 1975).

FERTILITY PARAMETERS

We have considered the history of
previous spontaneous abortions, gestational duration, intrauterine growth,
and age of women in relation to PGM,
phenotypes.

The value of the first three variables
as fertility parameters is well established in the literature (MacCluer,
1978). The fourth parameter needs
some elucidation.

fertile woman is much below her natural reproduction rate, it is impossible
to measure directly her reproductive
potential by means of parameters traditionally used in population genetic
studies such as total live births or offspring surviving to maturity (MacCluer, 1978). However, assuming that
the number of children is planned by
the couple, it should take a shorter
time to produce this number by women
whose reproduction rate is higher.
Moreover, it can be reasonably assumed that socioeconomic status and
the family-planning strategy chosen by
the couple do not depend on the PGM,
genotype of the woman. Therefore, in
a random sample of pregnant women
from an ethnically homogeneous population, genotypes with a higher rate of
reproduction should be over-represented among women of younger ages
and under-represented among women
of older ages, whereas the reverse
should be true for genotypes with a
lower rate of reproduction. Based on
this conceptual framework, a mathematical model of age-related differences in the distribution of types
among pregnant women has been recently proposed (Gimelfarb and Bottini, 1989).

RESULTS

Table 1 shows the mean age of fertile women according to PGM, pheno
Social Biology

type: PGM, 1 women have an average
of 29.2 years, and PGM, 2, an average
of 24.7 years. PGM, 2—1 women show
an intermediate value. The differences
are highly significant.

Table 2 shows the PGM, phenotypic
and allelic distributions among four
age groups of pregnant women delivering a live-born infant. The differences in the phenotypic distributions
between the age groups of pregnant
women are attributable to the differences in the phenotypic proportions of
PGM, 1 and PGM, 2. The proportion
of PGM, 1 phenotypes is higher and
that of PGM, 2 phenotypes is lower
among pregnant women of older ages
than among pregnant women of
younger ages. The relation between
age and phenotypic proportion is linear, 1.e., the proportion of PGM, 1
progressively increases and that of
PGM, 2 progressively decreases with
age of women. The increase of the
PGM} factor (and the decrease of
PGM}3) with age of women is clearly
evident also from the analysis of allelic
distribution. For comparison, PGM,
phenotype and allele frequencies in
newborn female babies from the same
population are also shown in Table 1.
Fertile women aged 24-28 years show
PGM, phenotype and allele frequencies superimposable upon those observed in female newborn babies. In
younger women there is an increase of

women there is an increase of the
PGM, 1 phenotype as compared to female newborns.

Table 3 shows the incidence of spontaneous abortion in relation to PGM,

incidence of abortion. The relation depends on the PGM, phenotype, as
shown by the statistically significant

dence of abortion among women of
older ages as compared to those of
younger ages is observed in women of
PGM,-1 phenotype. No significant relation with age is observed among
women carrying the PGM7? allele
(PGM,-2 and PGM, 2~1 phenotypes).
An apparent protective effect of the
PGM,-1 phenotype toward spontaneous abortion in women of younger ages
is also suggested by our data (see discussion).

Table 4 reports the effects of maternal age and PGM, phenotype on gestational duration. PGM, 2-1 phenotype shows the longest gestational
duration and PGM, 2 phenotype shows
the shortest gestational duration. A
highly significant association between
PGM, phenotype and gestational duration is present only among women
of younger ages. No significant interaction is observed between PGM, and
maternal age. This finding indicates
that the pattern of association between
gestational duration and PGM, phenotype is the same in both age groups, but
it is much stronger among younger
women than among older ones.

Table 5 shows the effects of maternal age and PGM, phenotype on birth
weight. A highly significant association
is observed between maternal PGM,
and intrauterine growth. The proportion of infants between the 10th and
90th percentiles decreases with the
dose of maternal PGM? allele (i.e.,
PGM, 1 < PGM, 2-1 < PGM;, 2), and
correspondingly there is an increase of
both small-for-dates and macrosomic
infants. The association is highly significant among women of younger ages,

Gloria-Bottini et al.

Social Biology

and it is much less strong among
women of older ages. No significant
three-way interaction is observed, thus
indicating that the pattern of relations
between intrauterine growth and
PGM, is the same in both age groups
and that there is only a difference in
the strength of association.

No significant association of fetal
PGM, phenotype with gestational duration and intrauterine growth was observed in the sample of newborn infants (data not shown).

DISCUSSION

The present study shows significant
differences in the proportion of phenotypes PGM, 1 and PGM, 2 among
pregnant women of younger and older
ages. The proportion of PGM, 2 is
higher, whereas the proportion of
PGM, 1 is lower, among younger than
among older women. A comparison
with a samole of female children shows
the absence of any age trend in the distribution of PGM, 1 and PGM, 2 phenotypes as well as in the proportions
of PGM, alleles. The frequencies of

PGM, phenotypes in the sample of
children fall in-between the corresponding parameters in the groups of
younger and older women. Thus, this
phenomenon cannot be explained by
differential mortality rates of the two
PGM, phenotypes. On the other hand,
the mortality of at least some of the
genotypes should be unrealistically
high in order to account for the differences between their proportion in the
age groups of pregnant women.

The differences in the proportions
of PGM, 1 and PGM, 2 phenotypes
among younger and older pregnant
women may be explained by different
rates of reproduction by women of
those phenotypes. Assuming that
PGM, 2 women have a higher, whereas PGM, 1 women have a lower rate
of reproduction and assuming that
women were producing as many children as they are capable of, the number of children produced by PGM, 2
women would be higher than the number produced by PGM, 1 women. In
reality, however, in our population,
the number of children produced by a
woman is much below her natural reproductive capacity, and offspring size
variance is much lower than that observed in the last generations. Given

Phosphoglucomutase and Fertility

 

251

that presently there is a tendency for
all women to produce approximately
the same number of children, it should
take a shorter time to produce this
number by a woman with a higher
reproduction rate than by a woman
whose reproduction rate is lower.
Hence, women with a higher rate of reproduction will be over-represented
among pregnant women of older ages,
whereas the reverse will be true for
women with a lower rate of reproduction.

Since all women were children originally, the population of children of female sex should be a mixture of the two
populations: women becoming pregnant at an earlier age and women becoming pregnant at an older age.
Therefore, parameters of the PGM,
distribution in children of female sex
should fall between the corresponding
parameters in the two extreme age
groups of pregnant women. This is exactly what happens in our data.

The increased proportion of PGM,
1 phenotype among older pregnant
women might also suggest that these
subjects retain a relatively high reproductive performance in the stage of
declining fertility. However, the PGM,
distribution observed in the youngest

class of women (i.e., low proportion of
PGM, 1 and very high proportion of
PGM, 2) argues against this hypothesis.

Table 3 shows that there is a signif
-icant effect of PGM, also on the rela
tion between age of women and probability of having a positive history of
spontaneous abortion. In the interpretation of these observations, however,
it should be considered that spontaneous abortion represents a small fraction of the total spontaneous loss of
zygotes. The data suggest that in older
ages PGM, 1 women share an increased incidence of spontaneous
abortion as compared to other PGM,
types. The data also show that in
younger ages the incidence of clinically
recognizable spontaneous abortion is
lower in PGM, 1 women than among
other PGM, types. It is possible that
PGM, 1 women have an increased
probability of early spontaneous loss as
compared to other women, and this
may cause a lower incidence of abortion in later stages of pregnancy.

In PGM, 2 mothers the distribution
of gestational duration is shifted toward the lowest values, whereas in
PGM, 2-1 mothers it appears shifted
toward the highest values. Considering
also the association with intrauterine
growth rate, the data suggest that both
fetal growth and timing of fetalmaternal relationship are anticipated
in PGM, 2 mothers as compared to
other mothers. PGM, 2-1 mothers
show the longest duration of gestation
with an intermediate value of fetal
growth variability. This may give a reproductive advantage to the heterozygote genotype, thus contributing to the
maintenance of PGM, polymorphism.

Gloria-Bottini et al.

Social Biology

The fact that the association between maternal PGM, and developmental parameters tends to disappear
in women of older ages may be explained considering that the subtle effects of normal genetic variability are
gradually obscured by stronger factors
emerging with reproductive senescence.

Chakraborty et al. (1986) have examined possible relations between a
series of fertility parameters (number
of pregnancies, number of live births,
number of children alive at the time of
survey) and heterozygosity for a number of polymorphic loci. No association
was found with PGM, heterozygosity.
It would have been interesting to consider also possible differences between
the two homozygotes PGM, 1 and
PGM, 2. Our data clearly show that
differences in fertility parameters between homozygotes are much greater
than those observed between homozygotes and heterozygotes. We do not
think that the fertility parameters considered by Chakraborty et al. (1986)
are the most suitable to detect possible
effects of maternal common genetic
polymorphism on survival at early
stages of implantation and on development during intrauterine life. It is very
unlikely, in fact, that the action of such
maternal genes have measurable effects on survival during the first years
of extrauterine life.

The very high mortality rate of zygotes at the early stages of life suggests
that factors intrinsic to developmental
processes are much more important
than environmental factors. It is likely
that stochastic and genetic factors are
the most important determinants of
such high mortality rates. Their effects

Vol. 39, No. 3-4

are probably amplified by the instability of cellular systems during the early
stages of life. On the contrary, it is well
known that the most important determinants of child survival after birth are
nutritional and infectious factors.

PGM, is a key enzyme in glucose
metabolism and its activity may have
an important role in survival during development. Although the placenta is
very rich in PGM,, the enzyme is controlled by fetal genotype in this tissue.
It 1s, therefore, unlikely that the relation between maternal PGM, and fertility is due to a mechanism operating
primarily at the placental level. PGM,
may contribute to the maternal glycemic control and, on the other hand, the
stability of nutritional support may be
of critical importance during the early
stages of zygote implantation, Furthermore, in the very early stages of development the contribution of the maternal genotype to the enzymatic and
metabolic makeup of the zygote may
overshadow that of the paternal genotype, and the slightly lower activity of
the PGM{ product compared to that of
the PGM{? allele may influence zygote
survival negatively.

Confirmation of possible effects of
the maternal PGM, genotype at implantation and/or in subsequent stages
of intrauterine development may be
gathered through the analysis of success rate in the practice of “in vitro”
fertilization. On the other hand, determination of the PGM, phenotype may
reveal a useful predictor of risk of
failure.

Considering the whole pattern of associations between PGM, and the set
of fertility parameters (age of women,
gestational duration, birth weight, and

Phosphoglucomutase and Fertility

253

history of spontaneous abortion), it appears very unlikely that it represents a
mere sampling chance phenomenon.

An association between two variables does not prove, however, a direct
cause-effect relationship. In general,
various other possibilities should be excluded. Some of these are depicted in
Figure 1 in which possible effects of
family-planning strategy and socioeconomic status (variable z) have been
considered. Path (A) shows a statistical
association between x and y without
causal relation. In fact, x and y represent independent effects of a third variable (z). Since PGM, is a primary genetic factor which is determined at
zygote formation, its genotype cannot
be caused by other variables. Therefore, Path (A) can be excluded.

It can also be reasonably assumed
that socioeconomic status and familyplanning strategy are independent of
the PGM, genotype of the women.
This consideration allows the exclusion
of Path (B).

In the remaining path (C), the variable z does not appear to be responsible for the association between PGM,
and age of women. It is possible, however, that if one controls for familyplanning strategy, the association may
be stronger in some categories than in
others. Therefore, it is conceivable
that the length of planned period to
complete family size may influence the
strength of association between PGM,
and age.

A spurious association between x
and y may result from the sampling of
two different populations. Suppose
that the sample is composed of individuals from a population showing a high
frequency of PGM, 2 and a tendency to

have children at early ages and by individuals from another population
showing a high frequency of PGM, 1
and a tendency to have children at late
ages. Such stratification may produce
the type of association shown in Table
2. The population of Rome ts a mixture
of people from various parts of Italy.
However, this fact should not play an
important role in the association shown
in Table 1 for the following reasons: (1)
In the present generation the population of Rome is practically panmictic;
(2) Only slight differences in PGM,
gene frequencies have been observed
among the various Italian regions.
On the whole, our observations
seem to indicate the existence of a true
association between PGM, and fertility. Although we favor a direct involvement of the PGM, locus (i.e., a causal
relationship), the possibility that the
observed pattern of associations may
be due to genes linked to PGM, and in
linkage disequilibrium with it cannot
be excluded. In fact, besides PGM,,
several other genes important in carbohydrate metabolism, such as AMY
1, AMY 2, GDH, 6-PGD, ENO 1 and

Phosphoglucomutase and Fertility

255

UDP-Gal-4-epim are located on the
short arm of chromosome number 1
(McKusick, 1983). Moreover, recent
investigations of our group have shown
that clinical manifestations of diabetic
pregnancy (such as macrosomia and
neonatal hypoglycemia) are associated
with haplotypic combinations of genes
in this area (Bottini et al., 1988;
Gloria-Bottini et al., 1989).

In the last decades, clinical and experimental investigations have mainly
focused on the immunological aspects
of fertility and the maternal-fetal relationship. Recent evidence points also
to nutritional and metabolic determinants of fertility (Schneider and Wade,
1989). Our observations suggest that
genetic polymorphism of enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism
may influence ‘normal’ variability of
fertility parameters. In special situations such genes may have clinical relevance.
