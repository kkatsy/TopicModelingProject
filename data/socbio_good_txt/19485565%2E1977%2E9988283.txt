ABSTRACT: The interactive behavior of two-year-old male twins (17 MZ, 29 DZ pairs) with their
parents was observed in the home and laboratory. Behavior counts, ratings, and experimental
measures were subjected to a biometrical genetic analysis. A model which included only withinand between-families environmental effects fitted most variables best, except for Instrumental
Independence (a rating) and Speech Rate (a count variable) which showed a significant genetic
component. Low reliability may explain the small proportion of genetic variation in count
variables, but the greater reliability of ratings and experimental measures (the latter, however, of
doubtful construct validity) did not produce greater genetic determination. The largest part of the
variance was explained by between-families environmental differences, only a minor part of
which was due to interobserver differences. The probability of detecting genetic determination

with this sample size, although it was large for an ethological study, is rather low.

Ethological methods and outlook have
recently attracted behavioral scientists
and have led them to look at human behavioral characteristics from an evolutionary perspective. Thus, attachment behavior has been viewed from the point of
view of its evolutionary significance (e.g.,
Bowlby, 1971) and so has compliance with
the norms of the social group (e.g., Stayton
et al., 1971). An evolutionary perspective,
however, inevitably implies partial genetical control of behavior, as evidenced by
the question: “Why does this kind of animal solve those problems of survival in
this way? (What is the evolutionary history of the behavior?)” (Blurton-Jones,
1974, p. 266). In the typical ethological
study it is assumed, from a knowledge of
the animal’s ontogeny combined with observation, that learning plays little part in
the development of certain kinds of behavior, which are then classified as innate.
Both animal ethologists and those applying the ethological approach to human be
havior have generally fought strangely shy
of genetical studies proper (cf. Gould,
1974), although some exceptions exist,
(e.g., Freedman, 1974).

Historically, ethological investigations
have concentrated on describing “typical”
patterns of behavior and have tended to
ignore individual differences. Although
this procedure may have been justified in
the descriptive natural-history phase of
the subject, an investigation of the causes
of individual differences could lead to a
more profound understanding of the biological importance and evolutionary history of the traits in question.

While it is possible to investigate human
behavior and characteristics by means of
questionnaires and tests, it is difficult to
know how to approach the problem of
social interactive behavior in the family or
other group. It is in this area that the
ethological approach has been increasingly
used in recent years. When done with
twins, such investigations provide a wel

come opportunity to investigate the differences between individuals in observed interactive behavior from a genetical point
of view.

This paper reports the biometrical genetical analysis of interactive behavior
and other measures for two-year-old male
sets of twins. The investigation was undertaken in order to assess the relative
importance of genetical and environmental contributions to variation in certain
social characteristics of young children, as
well as to examine the development of
these characteristics in the context of
parent-child interaction. The characteristics focused on were compliance, attachment, independence, speech, and activity
level. Child-parent interactive behavior
was studied by means of naturalistic observation in the home, i.e., by an essentially ethological method, but was supplemented by interviews and ratings as
well as by experimental procedures.

One assumption underlying the twin
method, that parents make no greater distinctions between DZ twins than they do
between MZ twins, is discussed (and essentially shown to be correct) in a separate
paper (Lytton, 1977).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

SAMPLE

The sample consisted of 46 sets of male
twins (17 MZ and 29 DZ), as well as 44
male singletons. Mean ages of the three
groups were (in months): MZ, 32.0; DZ,
32.4; and singletons, 33.4. The age range
was 25 to 35 months.

Twins were located through the birth
registers of the local hospitals. The expectation is that after the first year of life
surviving same-sex twin pairs represent
0.64 per cent of the population, and therefore 0.32 per cent will be same-sex pairs
(Allen, 1955). This statistic provides an
expectation of 25.6 same-sex male pairs

per year, given approximately 8,000 births
per year in Calgary. We ascertained 25
born in 1969 and 26 born in 1970; therefore our ascertainment approximates the
theoretical expectation very closely. Of
these pairs, 14 were not included in the
investigation: in three pairs, one partner
had died, six families had left the city, two
families did not speak English in the
home, one could not be traced, and two
refused to participate. While no data are
available to compare those not included
with those participating, the sample represents a very large proportion of the total
male twin population born during those
years, and there is no reason to suspect
that the sample differs from the total
population to any significant extent. Nine
of the twin sets came from nearby towns.
All available twins were seen, even if the
mother was the only parent in the home
(four families). The twin sample consisted
of approximately one-third middle-class
and two-thirds working-class families,
based on father’s occupation (Blishen,
1967), and singletons were chosen so that
their social class distribution would be the
same. The subjects were all white.

Zygosity of the twins was ascertained
after the psychological investigation by
blood typing of between 16 and 22 blood
group systems. In five cases, when blood
typing was impossible, zygosity was ascertained by finger ridge counts and physical
similarity profile. By ascertaining zygosity
after the testing, the chance was lessened
of an observer having preconceived notions of how similar or different twins
should be.

While many of the variables regressed
on age, analysis of covariance showed that
none of the differences in means of MZ
and DZ groups and only three of the mean
differences between twin and singleton
groups (Variables 15, 16, and 23) could be
accounted for by different age compositions of the groups.

Although every effort was made to obtain twin and singleton groups matched by
father’s occupation, when the sample had
been ascertained it was found that groups
differed slightly in the distribution of
mother’s education (see Table 1.) While
the chi-squares for differences between
twins and singletons and between MZ and
DZ groups are not significant, it is evident
that mothers’ education is somewhat
higher among singleton compared with
twin families and among DZ compared
with MZ families. (The latter could, of
course, not be matched before the experiment.)

included in the observation whenever
possible, but in some cases they were unavoidably absent. Therefore, we have records for fathers of only 38 sets of twins.
The behavior of the target twins, as well
as any behavior of others that impinged on
them, was recorded continuously by dictating coded statements into a microphone
held close to the mouth. The observation
records were transferred to punched cards
and analyzed by computer. A second observer was present for the second session
in each home for the purpose of interviewing and rating the mother.

Mothers were interviewed regarding

Differences between twins and singletons and between twin and singleton parents are discussed in a separate report
(Lytton et al., 1977). In fact, only a few of
these differences could be accounted for by
disparities between the groups in mother’s
education.

PROCEDURE

Since the method employed in-the-home
observations, and its attendant problems
are discussed in detail in Lytton (1973),
only a brief outline will be given here.
Data on parent-child interaction were obtained from two three-hour observation
sessions, during which unstructured family interaction was noted in predetermined
code by trained observers. Fathers were

their perceptions of the children’s characteristics as well as their own childrearing
practices and attitudes, and some fathers
were given a questionnaire containing
parallel questions. Mothers were also
asked to write an hour-by-hour account
over a 24-hour period of all the incidents
concerning the children and their own
reactions to them (“diary”).

MEASURES

Behavior Counts.—Specified types of
behavior were categorized from the observation record, and summed frequency
counts were computed for child, mother,
and father. The measure of compliance
(called “comply ratio”) was the ratio of all
instances of compliance to the total com

pliant plus noncompliant behavior. Instances of certain kinds of behavior, e.g.,
attachment behavior, were converted to a
“rate per minute.” Frequencies of other
types of behavior were expressed as a percentage of the total actions of the given
agent (see Table 2.)

in Table 2. Some of the variables are
superordinate categories, representing the
sum of several frequency counts, e.g., “attachment rate” sums instances of seeking
mother’s or father’s proximity, attention,
and help, “positive action” includes expressing affection, helping, showing pleasure, etc., “negative action” subsumes ignoring, yelling, refusing, hitting, etc.

INTERSITUATIONAL STABILITY AND
INTEROBSERVER AGREEMENT

The stability of behavior over two observation sessions was assessed by calculating Spearman’s rho coefficients for
the relative frequencies of some important
behavior categories over all children. The
coefficients for child behavior range from
0.67 for the rate of shift in activity to 0.21
for per cent of time spent in toy play, with
a median of 0.49. The stability of behavior
over two sessions is therefore only moderate, most of the coefficients being in the
0.40 to 0.50 range. It is, of course, not to
be expected that children and parents engage in the same behavior to exactly the
same extent on two occasions, since different situations will call forth different frequencies of given types of behavior. The
data from two observation sessions were
pooled in order to average out some of
these fluctuations and to provide a more
stable estimate of child or parent behavior.

Interobserver agreement was estimated
by having two observers present in the
home, each dictating a record (in a
whisper) into a separate microphone. An
agreement was counted when the same
subject and predicate occurred for both
observers within a thirty-second interval,
and these agreements were summed over
one-hour segments, taken from actual
home observations. When actions recorded by one observer, but not by the
other, were counted in with the disagreements, agreement reached 69.3 per cent,

 

et al. Social Biology
and the median of four reliability checks
was 63.9 per cent. When these actions
were omitted from the calculations, maximum agreement was 85.6 per cent and
the median 76.9 per cent, these figures
being a measure of the extent to which two
observers agree on the coding of behavior
they both recorded (cf. Lytton, 1973, and
Lytton and Zwirner, 1975, for further details).

The agreement between observers on
the relative frequency overall of some important behavioral variables was also investigated. It was found that the two main
observers agreed very closely on seven important variables (p = 0.996 for the null
hypothesis of no difference by simultaneous confidence test, cf. Bock and Haggard, 1968). However, since four different
observers were employed in the data collection, a certain amount of betweenfamilies variance could be contributed by
differences between observers. This possibility will be examined below.

It is clear that the count variables of
behavior in the home are rather unstable
over time and subject to observer variation in recording. The likelihood of being
able to detect reliable genetical or environmental variance against this background of behavioral lability within families and observer variation between families is correspondingly reduced. However,
this argument is not applicable to the ratings and the experimental playroom measures.

In the case of five children, lack of
cooperation during the Peabody Picture
Vocabulary Test in the experimental
playroom suggested that the results would
be misleading, and the test was therefore
repeated in the home a week or two later.
We therefore have some information,
though based on a very small sample and
one of atypical cases, on the reliability of
the PPVT. There were both upward and
downward changes in IQ score, when the

test was given at home; they ranged from
zero to 13 points, with an average of 5.6
points. The nonsignificance of Kendall’s
tau between the two occasions suggests
some instability of the PPVT score at this
age (judging by the present limited evidence) which might explain the peculiarities of this test’s performance in the
analysis (see below).

BIOMETRICAL-GENETICAL ANALYSIS
OF THE DATA

FITTING GENOTYPE-ENVIRONMENT MODELS
TO THE DATA

The assumptions and method required
for the biometrical genetical analysis of
twin data have been discussed in detail by
Eaves and Eysenck (1975) and Jinks and
Fulker (1970); only an outline will be given
here.

The starting point for an analysis of the
causes of variation is the between- and
within-pairs mean squares obtained from
an analysis of variance on pairs of twin
scores:

Expected
df mean squares
Between pairs n—1 oy* + 20,7
Within pairs 2x Cry?

The opportunity for partitioning genetical
and environmental contributions to the
total variance arises from the fact that the
genetical expectations for o,,? and o;? are
different for MZ and DZ twins. We define E, to be a variance component due
to individual environmental experiences
within a twin pair (this will include chance
environmental experiences and errors of
measurement); EF. is variance due to environmental differences between pairs and
will include cultural and class differences;
D, represents additive genetical variance
and is defined in detail in Mather and
Jinks (1971), as are the other terms.

From the following equations,

Opuz’ = E, + “Dp,
Owmz” = E;,

Oppz” = E, + VaDp,
Ownz” = E, + YDp,

we can write our model for MZ and DZ
mean squares in terms of the parameters
and Dr in the following matrix form:

Mean square E, Ez, Dr
MZ, 1 2 1
MZ,, 1 0 0
DZ, 1 2 %
Dl w 1 0 %

We have four observed statistics (mean
squares) and three unknown parameters
for which we obtain estimates by the
method of weighted least squares (see
Eaves and Eysenck, 1975).

If we haves observed mean squares and
estimate p parameters, then we are left
With a residual sum of squares which, for
large numbers, is distributed approximately as chi-square on s-p degrees of
freedom with which to test the fit of the
model. We may fit other models which are
subsets of the three parameter model given
above, and below we fit models including
the Z, parameter alone, and two twoparameter models, £,#, and £,Dpz.

If numbers are sufficiently large, the
method of weighted least squares provides
maximum likelihood estimates of genetical
and environmental parameters and subsumes less efficient ratios such as those of
Falconer (1960), Holzinger, and others
which attempt to provide “heritability”
estimates with no test of the implied model
(Jinks and Fulker, 1970).

If either of the two parameter models
fails, then there is justification for fitting a
third parameter. What the third parameter might be, however, is largely a matter
of choice in the absence of a further group
of relatives, e.g., parents and offspring,
adopted subjects, and so on. Any threeDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

parameter model which constrains the
total variances to be equal will give identical residuals. Thus, although estimates are
given for Dr, E,, and Ez, we must recognize that the model may be reparameterized in a number of other more or less
plausible ways. In this particular study,
the problems are heightened by the small
samples available, and in many variables
it is impossible to discriminate between
alternative models.

The general criteria to be satisfied, before fitting models in which no covariance
between genotype and environment is assumed, have been stated by Jinks and
Fulker (1970). Basically, one should see
whether the MZ and DZ groups have been
sampled from the same population by testing whether the total means and variances
are equal, and one should do what one can
to test for genotype times environment interaction. With a classic twin study such
as this one, we are only able to test for
interaction between within-pairs environmental effects (E,, measured by MZ
absolute pair differences) and genotype (G)
and/or between-families environmental effects (E,, measured by MZ pair sums).

Significant differences in means between the MZ and DZ groups were in fact
found, as is shown in Table 2. However,
these differences might possibly be explained by differences between the groups
in mother’s education, nonsignificant
though the latter were. Multiple regression
analyses were therefore performed, with
the child variables as the dependent variables and mother’s education and twin
type (MZ vs. DZ) as the independent variables, entered in this order. The results
showed that mother’s education did indeed predict these variables. Once this
fact had been allowed for, no significant
difference between MZ and DZ groups
remained in any variable, save Variable
23, and one such difference could be expected to occur by chance. In other words,

et al. Social Biology
the original differences in these variables
between the twin groups could be accounted for by differing distributions of
mother’s education (for further details, see
Lytton et al., 1977). Table 2 also indicates
where significant differences exist between
the total variances of the MZ and DZ
groups.

The variable showing one of the largest
differences between groups is the Peabody
Picture Vocabulary Test. The differences
probably reflect inequalities of sampling
and possible dependence of means and
variances. The large day-to-day fluctuations in attention and motivation usually
encountered in children of this age (note
the seeming unreliability of the test reported above) would also have led to
difficulties in standardization for this age
range (cf. Lyman in Buros, 1965, p. 820).
All this suggests that in this study the
PPVT is a highly unsatisfactory measure
and that little credence should be placed
on the findings for this variable.

A test for G X E interaction in twin
pairs (Jinks and Fulker, 1970), regression
of absolute MZ pair differences on their
pair sums, was also carried out for each
variable. Genotype-environment interactions detected in this way produce distortions in the distribution of the variable
which are a reflection of particular patterns of individual differences. Factors
which produce linear regressions also tend
to yield skewed distributions while kurtosis may reflect factors producing quadratic regression terms.

The worst distortions in scale are found
in the count variables where the preponderance of very low scores, either rates per
minute or percentages, produces strong
positive skewness and often positive kurtosis as well. Consequently it is not surprising to find most of the sum-difference
regressions among these variables. Significant (5 per cent or less) linear regression was found for Variables 6, 8, and 13;
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

Vol. 24, No. 3

significant quadratic regression for Variables 9, 10, and 18; both linear and quadratic regression for Variable 92.

It is well known that nonadditivity,
which produces, for example, sumdifference regressions for twin pairs, can
often be removed by transformation of
scale (see Mather and Jinks, 1971). However, it was found in a previous analysis of
twin-singleton differences (Lytton et al.,
1977) and in a genetic analysis of questionnaire personality data (Martin and
Eysenck, 1976) that transformation of
scale often made very little difference to
the results of the analysis of second-degree
statistics insmall samples. It was therefore
decided to carry out the initial genetic
analyses on untransformed data in the belief that the extra refinement would not
substantially affect the conclusions. Inspection of the distributions of variables
displaying sum-difference regressions (6,
8, 9, 10, 13, 18) suggested that a squareroot transformation might remove the
nonnormality of the distributions and the
regressions. The transformation was successful for Variables 6, 9, and 18, but
made little difference to the results of the
genetical analysis of these variables.

RESULTS

No simple model will fit data that do not
satisfy the criterion of equality of total
variances for MZ and DZ groups. For this
reason, variables in which the total MZ
and DZ variables are different are omitted
from the present genetical analysis. However, Eaves (1976) provides the foundation for an analysis of such differences.
Individual variables that make up the

data as when it is expressed as a rate per
minute and has also been deleted.

The results of fitting the £1, E,Ez,
E,Dp, and E,E2,Dr models mentioned
above to the remaining 18 variables are
shown in Table 3. The table gives the
residual chi-squares after fitting these four
models by the method of weighted least
squares. A model fits when the associated
chi-square is not significant. The significance of the parameters E, and Dp
from the fit of the E,E.Dr model is also
given.

The £, model tests the hypothesis that
all the mean squares are the same, i.e.,
that all the variance is due to error or
individual environmental experiences and
none is caused by systematic cultural or
genetical effects. We can see that this
model fits the data for four of the five
playroom experimental variables, and the
data for PPVT IQ, a test that was administered to nearly all subjects in the playroom. This finding confirms our suspicions
aroused by the poor construct validity of
the experimental variables (discussed in
Lytton, 1974) and problematic standardization of the PPVT. It suggests that much
of the behavior elicited in the playroom
was as arbitrary and artificial as the
playroom situation itself. This finding
should perhaps make us more wary of accepting results found in such experimental
situations.

In the remainder of the variables, the EZ,
model fails, implying that there are
sources of variance over and above error
and individual experience. The two-parameter models test respectively whether
this extra variance can be adequately explained by between-families environmental effects (E,) or additive genetical effects
(Dz).

The £,E. model fits every one of the
variables and in only one case, Instrumental Independence Rating, does the E,Dp
model give a better fit. In many cases, the

latter model actually fails. The E,E£.Dp
model also fits every variable, but only in
the case of two variables—Instrumental
Independence rating and Rate of Speech
—does the E,E.D,z model fit considerably
better than the E,E, model, and in these
variables the genetic contribution plays a
significant role. In all other cases it is nonsignificant, and in many instances even
slightly negative. Where the Dr estimate is
positive, a heritability estimate, 22 =
YDrel%Dr + E, + E2) is given in the
table and its significance level accords
with that of Dp.

Thus, from our analysis of the twin data
it appears that there is little genetical variance expressed in these measures of child
behavior. All of the variance can be accounted for by error and individual experiences and by environmental differences between families, except for Instrumental Independence and Rate of Speech.

VARIANCE BETWEEN OBSERVERS

We have found that the £,Z, model
seems the most appropriate for nearly all
the measures of child behavior. Because of
the low interobserver reliabilities, we have
speculated that some of the variance between twin pairs (E,) in the count variables can be traced to variation in the
coding behavior of observers. Inter-rater
agreement, however, was higher, and
therefore this argument will not apply to
ratings to the same extent and not at all to
the experimental measures, which were all
scored by the same experimenter.

To see how much of the environmental
variance between families was due to observers, a hierarchical analysis of variance
was carried out for all twin pairs, with
observers (N = 4) as the first factor and
twin pairs as the second factor, nested
within observers. Since inspection of the
distribution of mother’s education between observers suggested differences between them as regards this measure,

Behavior in Two-year-old Boys

 

 

209

mother’s education was used as a covariate to correct for these differences.

The results are shown in Table 4 for
those variables for which (a) Dp was not
significant and (b) the observer mean
square was significantly larger (10 per cent
level) than the pairs within observers’
mean square. The table permits a comparison of the proportion of total variance
due to observers (SSog/SS,r), after covarying mother’s education, and that due to
between-families differences, E.(E, +
E.).

It will be noted that all the variables
where a significant between-observers
component is found are count variables.
Child ratings, as expected, were less affected. Some of the differences originally
noted between observers in the activity
variables (Variables 24, 25 and 26) were
evidently due to differences in mother’s
education, since taking out the effect of
mother’s education reduced the proportions of observer variance from their original higher levels. However, other variables were not affected by this.

In most of these variables, observer
variance accounts for 10 to 20 per cent of
the total, but it goes as high as 39 per cent
for activity shift (Variable 24). A figure of
10 to 20 per cent of the total due to variance between observers seems reasonable
for count variables. This finding suggests

CONCLUSIONS

The only variables in this study for
which the genetic contribution was significant were instrumental independence
(a rating) and speech rate (a count variable). The latter variable which represents
speech facility in a natural situation is
probably a more reliable predictor of later
intelligence than the PPVT score, a vocabulary score obtained in a test situation
which depends on motivational and attentional factors that are very variable in
two-year-old children.

The difficulty of measuring interactive
behavior reliably by means of behavior
counts has been noted. The low reliability
over occasions and between observers and
other anomalies were, no doubt, part of
the reason why very little genetic determination of variation could be found in the
count variables. But, although ratings and
experimental scores showed greater reliability, the genetic contribution to these
measures was no higher. (As discussed
above, however, the construct validity of
the experimental scores was doubtful.)

Furthermore, recent power calculations
(Martin, in preparation) have shown that
the probability of detecting even large
amounts of genetic variation with samples
of this size is rather low. Yet the authors
know of no study involving detailed direct
observation of behavior that has a larger
sample, particularly since 44 singletons
were also included in this investigation.
This fact is not surprising in view of the
expenditure of time involved. It took
about 27 hours’ work to gather and process all the data for one twin pair up to the
time they were punched on cards. If such
an ethological approach is thought useful
because it increases ecological validity,
one will have to be satished with what, for
a genetical analysis, is a small sample.

Lytton et al.

Social Biology

The present results contrast with the
findings of some earlier work, employing
ratings (e.g., Scarr, 1969) and with those
of some recent large twin studies (Eaves
and Eysenck, 1974, 1975, 1976) which
found intermediate heritabilities for a variety of adult personality dimensions assessed by self-report questionnaires. Furthermore, these studies suggested that
environmental differences between families (E,) did not contribute significantly to
variation in these personality dimensions.
On the other hand, the low degree of genetic determination detected in our investigation is consistent with some earlier research in personality (e.g., Gottesman,
1966, compared with Nichols, 1969).
However, since environmental influences
and gene expression may well change with
age (e.g., Eaves and Eysenck, in press),
comparisons between our study and those
of adult subjects could well be misleading.

For most of the present personality
characteristics, the largest part of the
variance was explained by differences between families. These differences were
partly due to interobserver differences,
but they also reflected varying childrearing situations and differences in cultural
milieu. The systematic differences between twins and singletons, for instance
(see Lytton et al., 1977) seem to be an
expression of such environmental variations. An interesting question is whether
an investigation at a later age could detect
greater genetic determination in variables
collected in an ethological study such as
this one.
