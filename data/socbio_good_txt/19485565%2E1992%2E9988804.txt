Is Lactation Nature’s Contraceptive?

Data from Samoa

ABSTRACT: Data from a Samoan menstruation study suggest that lactation, even intensive
on-demand lactation, does not inhibit menstruation or conception. This paper explores the
applied and theoretical implications of continuing to accept lactation as a universally effective
fertility control mechanism. Such thinking can have disastrous implications for family planning
programs, and it keeps us from challenging long-held assumptions about lactation’s role in

population growth in early populations.

While most professionals realize
lactation is only one of several mechanisms involved in population regulation (e.g., contraception, abortion, infanticide, postpartum sex taboos),
many continue to assume that lactation
plays a primary role, especially in
Third World populations (e.g., Short,
1976, 1984; Anderson, 1983; Huffman,
1984; Biddulph, 1985; Laukaran and
vee 1985; Smith, 1985; Knodel et

, 1985). They, like Short (1976, p.
mt believe that: “Throughout the
world as a whole, more births are prevented by lactation than all other forms
of contraception put together.”’ Many,
again like Short (1976, 1984) and Jelliffe and Jelliffe (1982), go on to suggest that this has always been the case

in hominid populations. The idea that.

intensive on-demand lactation effectively suppresses ovulation and menstruation in all populations is so widely
held that it has been incorporated in
and is encouraged for incorporation
into family planning and infant feeding
policy throughout the world (e.g., Population Council, 1981; Huffman, 1984;

 

on

Laukaran and Winikoff, 1985; International Planned Parenthood Federation, 1987; Kennedy et al., 1989).

There is, however, a debate being
waged over whether or not lactation is
an effective contraceptive; and, if it is,
or was, then what is the primary mechanism involved (see for example:
Hodgson, 1985; Dobbing, 1982; Nardi,
1981). In terms of mechanism, there
are two principal schools of thought.
The first, most generally associated
with Rose Frisch, proposes that lactation’s contraceptive effect is associated
with undernutrition and low body fat
levels or ratios. The second suggests
that the production of prolactin, which
is stimulated by suckling, suppresses
the production of the hormones
needed for ovulation and normal
menses, but only if there is high frequency and duration of suckling. Occasionally, advocates suggest suppression is the result of a combination of
nutrition, body composition, and prolactin effect.

With a few notable exceptions, such
as work among the Hutterites (Eaton

and Mayer, 1953) and European and

American Caucasian populations
(e.g., Liestol, 1988;- Smith, 1985;
Howie and McNeilly in Short, 1984;
Salber et al., 1966), this debate is based
on data from populations with marginal or fluctuating levels of nutrition
(e.g., Howell, 1976, 1979; Hodgson,
1985; Ford and Huffman, 1988), small
stature (e.g., Chowdhury, 1978, and
Huffman et al., 1978a, b) or ones which
routinely utilize other fertility regulating methods. The debate incorporates
little information for non-Western,
healthy, robust populations, and little
from the South Pacific (Lucas and
Ware, 1981).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This paper does not consider in detail again the debate that has been explored at length elsewhere (for extensive reviews of this literature, see, for
example, Harrell, 1981; Hodgson,
1985; Short, 1976, 1984; Frisch, 1983,
1985, 1987; Anderson, 1983; Nardi,
1982; Huffman, 1984), but it does contribute to the debate by offering information on one robust, healthy, nonWestern population. It is based on
information collected in rural Western
Samoa, the more modernistic American Samoa, and urban Honolulu, Hawail, during 1986-87 as part of a Samoan menstrual experience study
conducted in conjunction with a University of Hawaii Samoan Health
Project. As lactation and its contraceptive effect were not the primary subject
of my research (see Fitzgerald, 1989,
1990), this material must be considered
preliminary and only suggestive. Nevertheless, I feel it forces us to reassess
our assumptions about lactation and its

 

 

Social Biology

role in the suppression of menses and
ovulation and thus its importance as a
primary factor in population regulation
amongst all populations, both in the
present and the past.

I began to question my assumption
about the role of lactation in the suppression of menses shortly after I arrived in American Samoa, our first
fieldwork site. Following an in-service
presentation on menstruation at the
LBJ Tropical Medical Center, a
woman came up to me and asked if it
was possible to get pregnant or menstruate while a woman was breastfeeding. As we talked I learned that, much
to her surprise, in spite of the fact she
was breastfeeding on-demand, she had
gotten pregnant when her baby was
only a couple of months old. She also
knew of others who had a similar experience. Soon thereafter I learned
that some of the Health Project subjects had resumed menses a month after childbirth.

When we went to rural Western Samoa, the district doctor told me that
rural Samoan women rarely come to
the clinic about menses-related issues.
One of the few times they come is if
they have not begun to menstruate
within a few months after giving birth,
a condition they think is unusual. He
also told me he has difficulty getting
many Public Health nurses to institute
family planning, with the women who
want it, before their first menses postpartum. As a result, because ovulation
can occur before the resumption of
menses, many of these women get
pregnant.

Other data offer further evidence
that intensive on-demand lactation, at
least among Samoans, does not always
suppress ovulation or menses. Because
Vol. 39, No. 1-2

bottle feeding is, and has been, a rare
event in the rural village on Savai’i in
Western Samoa where we did our
work, I have chosen to concentrate this
discussion on data from that site.! I will
supplement this data, when appropriate, with data from American Samoa
and Hawaii.

& BREASTFEEDING AND INFANT FEEDING
5 PRACTICES

=

® According to Bindon (1985), about

A40 per cent of the children in American
scSamoa are solely breastfed, while 89
Sper cent of the infants under five
comonths in Western Samoa are breastfed. In the rural Western Samoan vil"slage where we worked, it is extremely
-ztare for an infant to be bottlefed. In‘Ofants are fed on demand until they are
satisfied, and they are offered the
°breast whenever they cry (see also Kinloch, 1985; Nardi, 1984). Infant feedSing data collected by Daniggelis (1987)
‘Sin this village corroborate my impressions. Children may nurse until they

are two or three years old with the average being about 13 months. They
Susually sleep with their mother at least
Funtil they are weaned, and supplemenStal feedings are introduced when the
child is 5-6 months old. According to
Daniggelis, the average age for the introduction of other foods is 6.4
months.

I had only one encounter with bottle feeding
during the time I was in the village. As I was walking
across the village one day, a family called me over
to ask how to prepare formula. They had just come
from the clinic where they were told they needed to
give formula to a baby staying in their home. They
had no idea what to do. They had never prepared
formula, were unable to read the English directions,
and had nothing with which to measure the formula.

Lactation in Samoa 57

This age of weaning is consistent
with what Nardi (1984) suggests was
common for nineteenth-century Samoa. For the twentieth century, Mead
(1930) reports children were weaned
when they were 15-20 months old;
Schoeffel (1979) reports 14-15
months; and Nardi (1984) suggests
10-14 months, with one child in her
sample still being nursed at 21 months.
Nardi (1984) believes the age of weaning has declined in the last century because of a change in the pattern of women’s work (for other areas, see, for
example, Harrell, 1981; Huffman,
1984; Kurinu et al., 1989). This factor
is perhaps less important in our study
village because people are not as involved in the cash economy as in the
village where Nardi worked, and
women with very small children are
even less involved.

According to the women in my
study, breastfeeding begins within the
first twenty-four hours, usually within a
couple of hours, unless the mother,
midwife, or family feels there is a problem with the milk. For example, if the
mother’s milk is deemed insufficient,
the infant may receive supplements in
the form of coconut milk or supo
(soup) for a few days until the mother
can produce sufficient milk. During
this period the infant may also be
nursed periodically by another lactating woman. This situation is reported
to be the unusual case. Nardi (1984, p.
179) reports that some mothers in
Western Samoa nurse within an hour
of birth, and others give herbs in water
for the first day.

When asked if they offer supplements at all before the introduction of
solid food, women in my study reported that they felt there was no need.

Breastfeeding was viewed as sufficient
for most infants. Again, they reported
that supplements were only given if the
mother did not seem to have sufficient
milk or could not breastfeed for some
reason. Unlike other areas of Samoa
(Nardi, 1984), bottle feedings are not
used as supplemental feedings.

Based on information from my informants, my observations of Samoan
infant feeding practices, and material
available in the literature (e.g., Nardi,
1984; Daniggelis, 1987), I feel confident in stating that, at least in this village, Samoan women practice intensive on-demand breastfeeding twentyfour hours a day. As Nardi (1984, p.
279) observed, mothers are seldom far

- from their infants during the first few

months. They may occasionally leave
the baby in another’s care but rarely
for more than an hour or two before
the age of four or five months.

SEXUAL BEHAVIOR DURING LACTATION

According to historical documents,
Samoans practiced abstinence during
lactation (Schoeffel, 1979; Mageo, personal communication). Two of my respondents in Hawaii (one male and
one female) also report this abstinence. According to their explanation,
if the woman engages in regular intercourse, her milk will spoil. However,
in Western Samoa I was told that people do not always abstain, and, in some
cases, coitus may occur shortly after
childbirth. One woman claims she has
heard that some couples go to a stream
after childbirth to bathe and have sex.
This practice has been recorded for the
Marquesas (Suggs, 1966, and personal
communication, 1990). This same
woman suggests that some husbands
want, and may even demand, sex

Social Biology

within the first few days after childbirth.

According to Nardi (1985, p. 280),
people in the village where she worked
believe sex can affect breastmilk by the
introduction of germs, an explanation
obviously influenced by exposure to
Western medicine. Using this explanation, women claim they can use breastfeeding as a form of birth control, in
that husbands can be coaxed into abstaining from sex because of their concern for their babies health.

POSTPARTUM AMENORRHEA

One doctor in rural Western Samoa
estimates that 75-80 per cent of all
women in the area begin menstruating
within three months of delivery. This
estimate includes, however, women
who also bottlefeed as there are some
women in the larger villages along the
highway who do bottlefeed. A maternity nurse in American Samoa reports
that most women she knows in American Samoa, both those who breastfeed
and those who bottlefeed, resume
menses after one month, and it is not
uncommon for women to have two
births within a single year.

Formal and informal interview data
suggest that resumption of regular
menses within three months is very
common and within one month is not
unusual.? This finding is consistent
with the clinical experience with Sa
*Kennedy et al. (1989) state in their consensus
statement that all bleeds before 56 days (eight
weeks) can be ignored as a “normal postpartum
bleed.” Since I had never heard of such bleeds being
considered as a normal postpartum event, I spoke to
Dr. Ralph Hale, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the John A. Burns School of Medicine.
According to Dr. Hale, any postpartum bleed up to
eight weeks would, in his opinion, be a matter of
concern, and it would be very difficult to distinguish
such bleeding from the onset of menses.

and data from the United States

on the shortest period of amenorrhea

in my Western Samoan sample, 38.5
per cent had started menstruating
when the baby was roughly a month
old; 53.7 per cent were menstruating
by the time the baby was three months
old; and 76.8 per cent were menstruating by the time the baby was six
months old. Only one woman reports
ever having had postpartum amenorrhea that extended over a year. This
woman has three children. For the
first, her amenorrhea lasted one year;
for the second, one year and two
months; and for the third, ten months.

3Knodel et al. (1985, p. 308) have suggested that
the use of injectables, what Samoan women call “in
jections,” may lead some women to report they are
still in a state of postpartum amenorrhea when it is
actually the by-product of the medication. While injectables are used in Western Samoa, I do not think
their use is an issue for any of the women considered
here because my information indicates that those using “injections” started them after resumption of
menses.

were given supplemental feedings or
sucklings in the form of water, KoolAid, or a pacifier, as these are commonly seen in American Samoa, this is
highly unlikely in at least one case.
One of the women was frequently observed by Project staff, and we have lit-tle doubt that she was intensively lactating and was not offering anything
other than the breast. She frequently
talked with another staff member
about how much she loved breastfeeding her children. The day we did the
menstruation interview, she reported
that her period started a few hours before I arrived. She thought it was quite
an amusing coincidence; I thought it
was interesting because on that day her
baby was a month and a day old. She
reports that her first child was also just
a month old at first postpartum
menses.

I must suggest caution with this
data, even though Holland (1987) reports there is probably little distortion
in retrospective data on such related issues as duration of breastfeeding. All
estimates on resumption of menses are
based on the age of the child at that
time. While many children were less
than two years old at the time of the
interview, and several were less than
one year old, in other cases the children were several years old. Furthermore, the answers may indicate some
Samoan cultural belief about the ideal
time for menses to resume, and this
must be considered in future research.
Nevertheless, even if we assume the information is not completely accurate
and may be off by a month or more, we
still find that most women in Western
Samoa resume menses before six
months, and many even earlier, even
when they intensively lactate.

COMPLETED FAMILY SIZE AND BIRTH
INTERVALS

Completed family size and birth intervals can offer some idea about fertility potential in a population even
though they include only live births,
and often only those who survived the
first couple of months of infancy.
Based on data from the genealogies for
Western Samoa, completed mean average family size in our subjects’ generation is 7.8 (s.d., 3.08) with a range
of 1 to 14.4 As most of this data comes
from the subjects, and not their mothers, it may be incomplete and the actual number of live births may be
slightly higher, but the number is consistent with the 7.6 reported by Shankman (1976). The data on birth dates is
not as specific as we might like, but
does indicate that birth intervals were
usually between one and three years

‘This number includes only consanguineal sibs
from the same mother, and each mother is counted
only once. Data for ego’s generation were not used
because most have not completed their families
(some have not even begun), and the use of artificial
birth control is common in this generation (Fitzgerald, 1989).

 

8 months x 3, current baby is 4 months old no menses

Harbison and Weishaar (1981) report the total fertility rate for American Samoa as 5.9 and for Hawaii 4.9.
They also suggest that women who migrate to the more traditionally oriented
communities on the island of Oahu in
Hawaii have a higher total fertility rate
(TFR =5.3) than those who migrate to
Honolulu (TFR =4.3). They attribute
at least some of the variation to differences in contraceptive use.

Bopy COMPOSITION

Samoa offers a very lush and, usually, a secure nutritional environment.
While Samoans today may complain of
the lack of variety in their diet, their
diet generally meets their basic nutritional needs (Hanna et al., 1986), and
they only rarely experience depriva
*Comparing the dates offered within sib sets for
ego’s generation suggests there is reasonable consistency as to birth year, but data on month and day
are frequently missing. Where there are discrepancies in terms of birth year, it is almost always by a
single year. For example one sib might report a birth
year as 1963 and another might repost 1964; on the
other hand, one sib may have reported years of age
and another birth year and, thus, the discrepancy
may be an artifact of my calculations.

tion. The Samoan social system (including alofa [love or caring] and fa’alavelave [a social institution which
draws on community resources]) helps
insure that all Samoans’ basic nutritional needs are met. The traditional
Samoan diet is high in fat, most of
which comes from the ubiquitous use
of coconut cream. Samoans are well
recognized as being very robust. They
have been identified as one of the
heaviest groups of people in the world
(Pawson and Janes, 1981; Bindon,
1984; Crews, 1989). The average
weight for all females in our Western
Samoa sample (including those who
have never been pregnant, n=25) is 65
kg (143 pounds) (s.d., 2.76), average
height of 161.3 cm (s.d., 0.96), and average BMI (body mass index) is 24.95
(s.d., 0.93). Weight and BMI, but not
height, are significantly higher in
American Samoa and Hawaii. These
measurements are consistent with
other studies of Samoans (Baker et al.,
1986).

Frisch (1980, p. 26) states, “The
well-nourished human female, particularly on a diet with a high percentage
of calories from fat, may have higher
estrogen levels, which result in a higher
reproductive efficiency than is found in
females with less adiposity.” According to the nutrition/body composition
theory, lactation imposes a very high
energy demand. Thus, a poorly nourished woman or one with a minimal
store of body fat should be expected to
have a longer period of amenorrhea
and anovulation than a well-nourished
or robust woman (Frisch, 1975, 1985,
1987; Hodgson, 1985).

The second school of thought claims
that in order to suppress ovulation and
menses, breastfeeding must be inten

sive, namely there must be frequent,
regular stimulation through breastfeeding (see, for example, Jelliffe and
Jelliffe, 1982; Anderson, 1983; Huffman, 1984). This means that the infant
must have free access to the mother’s
breast both during the day and at night.
The early introduction of food supplements would decrease the need to
suckle and therefore the level of prolactin would be decreased—below the
level needed for suppression. Bongaarts (1985) suggests that the duration
of lactation (number of months involved) is more important than caloric
intake.

CONCLUSION

Like Hodgson (1985, p. 36), I would
argue that assumptions about the contraceptive function of lactation “could
have wide-ranging and perhaps disas- _
trous effects on family planning programs around the world.’ As Dobbing
(1982, p. 1725) suggests, lactation
seems to be an inefficient contraceptive
at the individual level (see also Smith,
1985) and ‘‘manifestly inadequate”’ at
the population level.

Too many places, including rural
areas of underdeveloped countries,
maintain high rates of growth in spite
of prolonged and intensive breastfeeding. Sometimes the rate of growth is
even higher than in neighboring urban
areas where breastfeeding is declining
(Nardi, 1981, p. 36; Dobbing, 1982).
Lactation is probably only effective as
a contraceptive if the woman is malnourished or has minimal fat stores
(Hodgson, 1985; see also Frisch, 1975),
and in populations only when this is the
common case. Thus, the same policy
about when to introduce birth control

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:44 08 December 2015

62 Fitzgerald

can not be used for all nations. I would
also argue that these assumptions have
important ramifications for conjectures
about fertility and population growth
over hominid history (see also Frisch,
1988).

Although my data are preliminary
and need to be expanded and refined in
future research, they suggest that
women in rural Samoa breastfeed intensively enough to produce levels of
prolactin to suppress menses if prolactin level 1s the necessary and sufficient
condition for postpartum amenorrhea.
However, breastfeeding does not appear to suppress their menses nor ovulation. On the other hand, they have
sufficient and, in many cases, more
than sufficient levels of fat, and, although anemia is not uncommon
(Wood and Gans, 1981), they are generally healthy and well-nourished.

Many studies (e.g., Harrell, 1981;
Nardi, 1984) suggest that lactating
women in urban and modernized societies begin to menstruate and ovulate
earlier than their urban or preindustrialized counterparts because of
changes in infant feeding practices
(i.e., scheduled breastfeeding, early
addition of supplements). While this
may be true in some cases, we must
also consider other changes, including
changes in body composition from either improved health and nutrition
(Lunnet al., 1981; Frisch, 1987) or sedentary lifestyle and changes in sexual
practices, namely a decrease in adherence to postpartum sex taboos.

If, however, most pre-industrial or
pre-historic populations lived in adequate, or even lush environments,
rather than the marginal environments
of so many contemporary hunters and
gatherers (Lee and DeVore, 1979,

Social Biology

p. 5), we can suggest that lactation may
have played a minor contraceptive or
population regulation role in these
populations. As Lee and DeVore
(1979, p. 5) have pointed out: ‘Taking
hunters as they are found, anthropologists have naturally been led to the
conclusion that their life (and by implication the life of our ancestors) was
a constant struggle for survival.’’ If,
rather, our ancestors generally had adequate fat stores and lactated on demand, like contemporary robust Samoans, then lactation’s potential
contraceptive feature may have only
been of value in periods of crisis.

Thus, lactation or female biology
would only come into play as a contraceptive when the mother’s very survival would be seriously threatened by
pregnancy. This suggests a more reasonable and adaptive relationship between the physical environment and biology (see also Frisch, 1987, p. 529)
and suggests that social behavior, such
as the use of “unnatural” contraceptives, infanticide, sex taboos, etc., is
more critical for controlling population
size than female biology.

To continue to believe that lactation
is Nature’s contraceptive can have disastrous effects, especially for populations like Samoans and those where
modernization is having a positive impact on health and nutrition. It is clear
that we need to reeducate family planning personnel that lactation, particularly in these populations, is not
sufficient to suppress ovulation. To
continue to believe and to continue to
promote the belief that lactation is an
effective natural contraceptive is simply too risky for the women involved.
It is also unfair to these women for it
