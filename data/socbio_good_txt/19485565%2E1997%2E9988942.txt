S ABSTRACT: The mortality patterns of men and women of working age, in terms of the major
causes of death, have changed over the past three decades. This study assesses the extent to

which mortality among persons of working age represents an economic loss to society. This eco- §nomic loss is measured by the per capita loss of productive working life, defined as the number
© of years, on the average, a person can expect to be an active member of the labor force. Causes of
A death affecting primarily older Americans (heart disease, cancer, stroke) had a relatively small
Sand declining impact on the working lives of men and women. Major causes of death affecting
& the young (motor vehicle accidents, homicide, AIDS), although accounting for fewer deaths,
co were responsible for many more years of lost productivity. Gender and socioeconomic differen“otials in mortality suggest that different strategies are necessary for future reductions in lost

—work-years.

& An individual’s tenure as a productive

=the result of an untimely death. Labor

Sextent to which mortality among persons
‘3 of working age represents an economic
S loss to society. This economic Joss can be
'E measured by the per capita loss of produc8 tive working life, defined as the number of
years, on the average, a person can expect
to be an active member of the labor force
(McKain and Stockwell, 1964).

For example, although motor vehicle
accidents account for a very small proportion of all deaths in the United States
(2 per cent in 1990), they result in a per
capita loss of productive working life that
is several times greater than the number
of work-years lost to the three leading
chronic causes of death. This study as
153

 

sesses the impact of specific causes of
death on the length of working-life for
men and women for 1970, 1980, and
1990. Comparisons are made between
men and women and across decades regarding the number of person-years of Iabor force participation lost due to each
cause. Changes reflect shifting mortality
patterns across the decades, partially the
result of the aging of the U.S. population.
The three leading causes of death in
the United States are heart disease, malignant neoplasms (cancer), and cerebrovascular diseases (stroke). In 1990 the death
rates for these causes (the number of
deaths from each cause per 100,000 popuJation) were 290 for heart disease, 203 for
cancer and 58 for stroke (National Center
for Health Statistics, 1994). In contrast,
the rate of mortality due to motor vehicle
accidents in 1990 was only 19 per
100,000 population. The death rate for the
tenth leading cause of death in 1990,
AIDS, was 10 per 100,000 (increasing to

16 per 100,000 in 1994) and the eleventh
leading cause, homicide, also had a rate
of 10 per 100,000 in 1990.

However, as noted above, the number
of years of worklife lost owing to a particular cause is in part a function of age at
death, with those causes disproportionally affecting younger persons having a
greater impact on years of productive
worklife than those causes primarily affecting older persons. This study compares the loss of person-years of labor
force participation from these leading
causes of death for American men and
women, differentiating between chronic
diseases (heart disease, cancer, stroke)
which generally affect older people and
causes primarily affecting younger people (motor vehicle accidents, homicide,
AIDS). Of particular interest are differences between men and women with respect to chronic diseases, and the extent
to which the latter three causes contribute
to a loss of working life for men and
women over the three periods.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

“An individual’s capacity to perform
work and earn money over a lifetime is in
part a function of the individual’s worklife expectancy” (Gamboa, 1995, p. 8).
The Bureau of Labor Statistics has been
producing worklife estimates for the U.S.
population since 1950 (Smith, 1986). Tables of working life are constructed to
summarize the behavior of all age groups
in the population in a given year, rather
than trace the “work history” of any one
group through its lifetime (Smith, 1982).
The tables estimate how frequently members of a population enter and leave the
labor force, and how long the average
person remains economically active, if

Social Biology

rates of behavior remained as they were
in the reference year (Smith, 1982). However, changing patterns of labor force
participation, namely the increased labor force participation of women since
1970, have greatly influenced worklife
expectancies over the decades. This trend,
combined with a slight waning in men’s
labor force attachment, has resulted in the
convergence of worklife expectancies for
American men and women since World
War II (Smith, 1982; Murdock, 1995).

However, changes in worklife expectancy across decades confound the analysis of changing mortality patterns, as the
number of years of worklife remaining
for women has been steadily increasing
while the number of years remaining for
men has declined slightly. By holding
worklife expectancies constant, changes
in the number of working years lost due
to the leading causes of death will reflect
changing patterns of mortality across the
decades instead of changes in labor force
participation. Thus, although worklife
models are available for U.S. men and
women from the U.S. Department of Labor for the years 1970, 1979-80, and 1995
(see The New Worklife Expectancy Tables,
revised in 1995 by Gamboa), the 1979-80
worklife expectancy values were used for
all three time periods.

To measure the extent to which a particular cause of death leads to a loss of active working life, it is necessary to weight
the number of deaths due to that cause at
each age by the corresponding number of
years of labor force participation remaining, on the average, to persons alive at this
age (McKain and Stockwell, 1964). This
was done in the present study as follows: _

(a) Separately for each of the causes
being considered (heart disease, cancer,
stroke, motor vehicle accidents, homicide

and AIDS), the number of male and female deaths at each age (in 5-year age
groups) in the United States during the periods 1970, 1980, and 1990 (National
Center for Health Statistics, 1974, 1985,
1994) were multiplied by the average
worklife expectancy values at corresponding ages (the value corresponding to the
mean age of the cohort) taken from tables
_,, Of working life of the U.S. male and fe= = male population for the years 1979-80
“US. Department of Labor, 1982). For
2 persons who died at ages under 15 years,
® it was assumed that worklife expectancy
A was the same as at age 16. For deaths to
2 persons 75 to 79 years, it was assumed
& that worklife expectancy was the same as
co at age 75 (the highest age for which work3 life expectancy values were calculated).
(b) For males and females for each
time period, the resulting products were
ummed to yield an estimate of the total
umber of work-years lost from each
ause.
(c) Finally, a measure of the relative
2 impact of each cause on loss of working
2 life was obtained by dividing the total
number of work-years lost from each
© cause by the total number of deaths from
-¥ that cause.

RESULTS

Downloa

Among U.S. males in 1970, roughly
two-thirds (66 per cent) of all deaths due
to heart disease, cancer, and stroke occurred in persons 65 years of age or older.
Conversely, 88 per cent of the men dying
in motor vehicle accidents and 95 per
cent of men dying as a result of homicide
were under the age of 65, and 42 per cent
and 28 per cent were under age 25, respectively. The leading chronic causes of
death are largely characteristic of the later

adult ages, and it is very likely that persons succumbing to these diseases were
either retired or near retirement. Therefore, the per capita number of personyears of worklife lost due to these causes
is relatively small, declining slightly over
the decades (Table 1).

On the other hand, because deaths resulting from motor vehicle accidents and
homicide are much more common at the
younger ages, deaths from these causes
have a much greater impact on the number of active working years lost. Each
motor vehicle fatality in 1970 represented
an average loss of 24.5 years of working
life, while each homicide represented an
average loss of 24.0 years. Losses resulting from either of these two causes were
substantially larger than the average loss
from any of the three leading causes of
death.

Between 1970 and 1980, a reduction
in the average number of years of worklife lost from the three chronic diseases
occurred because of a decline in the proportion of deaths attributed to these diseases in the prime working years (age
16-64). By 1980, over two-thirds (69 per
cent) of deaths due to these chronic diseases occurred in persons age 65 and
older, with this proportion increasing to
approximately three-fourths (73 per cent)
by 1990. These changes have resulted in
a declining number of work-years lost per
death for each of the chronic diseases examined, especially between 1970 and
1980.

For male deaths attributed to motor vehicle accidents, an interesting pattern
emerged. Between 1970 and 1980, there
was an increase in the number of workyears lost per death, reflecting the increasing proportion of deaths attributed to
motor vehicle accidents occurring to those

in younger ages. For example, in 1970
men under 30 accounted for 52 per cent of
all male motor vehicle deaths. In 1980,
men under 30 accounted for 57 per cent of
these deaths. By 1990, however, the opposite was true. The proportion of deaths
from motor vehicle accidents attributed to
men under 30 declined to 48 per cent, resulting in a decline in the number of
work-years lost per death. These changes
likely reflect the changing age composition of the population, specifically, the
aging of baby-boom men out of their
“risk-taking” years (i.e., car accident-prone
years) over the two decades.

The average number of work-years
lost due to homicide increased slightly
between 1970 and 1980, and more significantly between 1980 to 1990. Again,
these changes reflect not an increasing
average age at death, as in the case of the
chronic diseases, but a declining average
age of death. For example, young men
aged 15-24 accounted for one-quarter of
male homicides in 1970. In 1990, they
accounted for nearly one-third (32 per
cent) of those killed (with 60 per cent of
that one-third comprised of black males).
In 1990, homicide overtook motor vehicle accidents as the cause of death which
had the greatest negative impact on pro
ductive work-years, followed by motor
vehicle accidents, then AIDS.

Deaths attributed to AIDS have a substantial impact on the number of workyears lost, as AIDS also greatly affects
men in their prime working ages. AIDS is
currently a leading cause of death of men
aged 25-44, who account for 75 per cent
of all male AIDS deaths. The average
number of work-years lost to each AIDS
death (21.4 in 1990) was nearly the same
as that of motor vehicle accidents (24.3).
It is apparent that deaths attributed to
AIDS should be included among the major causes of death affecting productive
working life along with motor vehicle
accidents and homicide, all of which
represent an important economic loss to
society.

When the causes of death were examined for women (Table 2), it was found
that the per capita number of personyears of worklife lost due to each of the
three leading chronic causes was relatively slight and was in fact generally less
than half that of men. Similar to the male
pattern, the proportion of female deaths
attributed to these causes occurring to
women age 65 and older increased over
the three periods, from 77 per cent in
1970 to 79 per cent in 1980, to 82 per

cent in 1990. Holding female worklife
expectancy values constant for each age
over the period, the number of workyears lost per death declined for each
cause. Women show greater reductions
than men in the average number of workyears lost due to the three chronic causes,
indicating greater improvements in their
health (refer to Table 1).

For deaths attributed to motor vehicle
accidents, the trend for females is again
similar to that of males. The number of
work-years lost per death owing to motor
vehicle accidents increased somewhat for
women between 1970 and 1980, a function of the declining age of the victims of
these accidents during this period. Between 1980 and 1990, however, the proportion of female fatalities due to motor
vehicle accidents under the age of 30 declined significantly, from 51 per cent in
1980 to 41 per cent in 1990. The average
number of work-years lost per death declined in response,

With respect to female homicide victims, the average number of work-years
lost per death increased between 1970 and
1990, especially between 1970 and 1980.
As was the case for males, the proportion
of female deaths due to homicide under
the age of 30 increased from 1970 to 1980
(45 per cent to 50 per cent, respectively).

However, unlike male homicide victims
who continued to get younger, the proportion of female victims under 30 declined
from 1980 to 1990, to 46 per cent. The
number of average work-years lost per female homicide death increased only
slightly from 1980 to 1990.

The number of productive work-years
lost per AIDS death was also examined
for women, and each death was shown to
represent more work-years lost than those
lost due to each motor vehicle fatality
(16.9 work-years compared to 15.4, respectively). Again, it is apparent the
deaths resulting from HIV infection need
to be included among the major causes of
death negatively affecting years of worklife for U.S. women. Of the major causes
of death examined, homicide had the
greatest negative impact on years of productive worklife for women in 1990, followed by AIDS, and finally, motor vehicle accidents. Interestingly, for all three
periods, homicide represented the greatest threat to the economic productivity of
women in terms of work-years lost than
any of the other causes.

CONCLUSIONS

Although accounting for fewer deaths
than the three major chronic causes, deaths

due to motor vehicle accidents, homicide,
and AIDS represent a much greater loss
of productive worklife than mortality statistics often suggest. In addition to disproportionally affecting young people,
motor vehicle accidents, AIDS, and most
importantly homicide disproportionally
affect disadvantaged populations in terms
of their socioeconomic status. As with all
social problems, these results illustrate
how our current mortality patterns have
the greatest negative impact on the most
deprived segments of the population.

It has been demonstrated that the effects of the various leading causes of
death on worklife should be examined for

Social Biology

both men and women, as women today
account for nearly one-half of the labor
force. Despite a slightly greater improvement in the average number of work-years
lost for women, the average number of female work-years lost to these causes are
approaching the levels of men, primarily
reflecting the increasing labor force participation of women since the 1970’s.
However, the impact of motor vehicle accidents, homicides, and AIDS deaths on
the number of work-years lost vary by
gender, suggesting that different strategies
are necessary for reductions in the number
of work-years lost in the future.
