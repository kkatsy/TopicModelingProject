Incidence of Congenital Malformations among

Live Births in Salt Lake City, Utah, 1951-1961

 

Charles M. Woolf and Judith A. Turner

Department of Zoology
Arizona State University
Tempe, Arizona

In 1960, studies were initiated to determine the etiological importance of genetic
and certain nongenetic factors for various
congenital malformations in the state of
Utah. The results of several of these studies
have been published (Woolf, Woolf, and
Broadbent, 19632, 19638, 1964, 1965; Woolf,
1963; Woolf, Koehn, and Coleman, 1968).
Other studies are in progress. These investigations have been carried out in Utah, taking advantage of a population that is relatively close-knit because of religious (Mormon) background. Another advantage is the
availability of genealogical records for
families affiliated with the Mormon church
(Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints). These records facilitate genetic
studies.

It was evident from the outset of these
studies that incidence values for various
congenital malformations were needed for
the determination of control values. Since
these values were not available for any segment of the Utah population, an effort was
made to obtain them by using nursery
records in the Latter-day Saints Hospital in
Salt Lake City, Utah. When a newly born
infant is admitted to the nursery of this
hospital, specific information is logged in a

record book: surname, date of birth, and sex.
Any malformation or disorder noted by the
attending physicians at the time of birth,
or during the sojourn of the infant in the
nursery, is made part of the record. These
records were surveyed for the years 19511961. During these years, 59,561 live births
occurred in this hospital, representing about
23% of the total live births in the state for
this period. The great majority of patients
who enter this hospital are Caucasian.
Hence, the nursery records reflect incidence
values among live births for Caucasians living in or near Salt Lake City, Utah. The
nursery records contain reliable information
for obvious congenital malformations; however, by their nature, they are not as complete as medical records. Nonetheless, nursery records are more complete than birth
certificates, a source frequently used to obtain incidence data.

Neel (1958) has emphasized the importance of obtaining reliable incidence data
for congenital malformations in various
populations. He has proposed that a variation in incidence values for specific malformations among populations (racial group)
may reflect differences in the frequencies of
polygenes. This proposal is based on a con
270

Vol. 16, No. 4

cept proposed by Lerner (1954) that Mendelian populations carry polygenic reserves
that increase the probability of normal development through a buffering action. These
polygenes are maintained in a population
by selection for the heterozygote. “Phenodeviants” occur when the number of heterozygous loci falls below a threshold value.
Certain types of congenital malformations
may qualify as Lerner’s phenodeviants, and
through the action of natural selection,
populations may have evolved different
polygenic systems; hence, a specific phenodeviant may occur at a higher frequency in
one racial group than another.

Since little has been published on the
incidence of congenital malformations in the
various populations in the United States,
the incidence values based on the nursery
records are presented here. These incidence
values have merit because of the welldefined structure of the population and the
relatively large size of the sample.

STRUCTURE OF THE POPULATION

The population of Utah is predominantly
Caucasian. Mormon pioneers arrived in the
Salt Lake Valley in 1847. Salt Lake Valley
and the surrounding area soon became a
“genetic melting pot” of individuals of different nationalities. Between 1847 and the
coming of the railroad in 1869, 80,000 members of the church from the United States
and Europe crossed the plains and mountains from the Midwest to the Salt Lake
Valley with ox- or mule-driven wagons or by
walking and pushing handcarts. From 1850
to 1900, over 30,000 converts emigrated to
Utah from the Scandinavian countries
(Mulder, 1955), and from 1850 to 1929, over
52,000 emigrated from Great Britain (Evans,
1937). Converts arrived in smaller numbers
from Germany, Holland, Austria, France,
Switzerland, and elsewhere. In 1880, twentyfive different nationalities were represented
(Mulder, 1956).

Birth Malformations in Utah

 

271

Although Mormon communities were
established in many locations in the intermountain West, and many of these relatively isolated communities were colonized by
groups of families, the rate of inbreeding in
the state never went as high as might have
been expected. A study of the frequency of
consanguineous marriages among the Mormon people and their relatives living in
Utah and in ten geographic regions in the
United States revealed that inbreeding has
been minimal when compared with populations in other parts of the world (Woolf
et al., 1956). The Mormon people in Utah,
especially those residing in cities, are highly
outbred, a situation resulting from the continual flow of emigrants to Utah and the
social pressure, especially in recent years,
against the marriage of closely related individuals. The composite and outbred nature
of the population dictates that traits resulting from rare autosomal recessive genes and
polygenes (quasi-continuous variation)
should be relatively infrequent.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A summary of the congenital malformations listed in the nursery records is presented in Table 1. The malformations are
grouped into systems, following the procedure of Neel (1958), Morton, Chung, and
Mi (1967), and Adams and Niswander
(1968). At least one malformation was listed
for 1,227 (654 males, 573 females) of the
59,561 infants (30,674 males, 28,887 females). The frequency of males with a malformation (2.13%) is not significantly different (0.20 > P > 0,10) from the frequency
of affected females (1.98%).

The total frequency (2.06%) ranks
among the top of those values reported for
other populations with or without stillbirths
included. Neel (1958) observed a total malformation frequency of 1.02% for the
Japanese population (live births and stillbirths). Frequency values of 1.58% and

TOTAL MALFORMATIONS

2.44% among Caucasian and Negro births,
respectively, including live births and fetal
deaths, were observed by Chung and Myrianthopolous (1968). Adams and Niswander
(1968) found a malformation frequency of
1.86% among North American Indian infants (live births and stillbirths). Using
birth and death certificates, Morton et al.
(1967) found a total frequency of 0.93%
among the various racial groups in Hawai.

The relatively high incidence (2.01%) obtained in this study is explicable by certain
idiosyncrasies of the nursery records. As a
part of a resident training and research program, the majority of the infants in the
nursery were given an extensive orthopedic
examination during the years 1951, 1954,
and 1955 (Coleman, 1956). An emphasis
was placed on the detection of hip dysplasia
and club foot. Anomalies of the muscularskeletal system are described in detail and
occur at a high frequency in the records during these years. The incidence of hip disease

and club foot, based solely on the data in the
nursery records, is extraordinary. The problem of obtaining a valid incidence value for
hip disease from the nursery data has been
discussed elsewhere (Woolf et al., 1968).
The removal of only club foot (484 cases)
from the calculations reduced the total malformation incidence value for the period
1951-1961 from 2.06% to 1.24%, a rate
which might be anticipated for live births.

Minor cases of club foot and hip dysplasia can be detected by a rigorous examination. Questions also obviously exist concerning the definition of these disorders. For
club foot, the data in the nursery records
indicate that variation in diagnosis was
most apparent for talipes calcaneovalgus.
The incidence values (frequency per 1,000)
for the years 1951, 1952, 1953, 1954, and
1955, were 21.61, 2.48, 3.66, 19.02, and
10.79, respectively, with an overall value of
11.38, The incidence values for metatarsus

0.00, 6.48, and 3.91, with an overall value of
4,23, Incidence values for the most severe
type of club foot, talipes equineovarus,
showed relatively minimal yearly variation
during this period: 2.87, 1.66, 1.63, 3.24,
1.68. The overall incidence (2.20) is similar
to that (2.32) reported by Chung and
Myrianthopolous (1968) for the incidence
of talipes equineovarus in Caucasians and

may reflect the true incidence of this disorder in the Utah population.

A comparison of incidence values obtained for different populations is quite
meaningless when there is variation in the
criteria of diagnosis and reporting procedures. The completeness of the nursery
records for club foot during 1951-55 is contrasted with their incompleteness during
1956-61. During the latter period this
anomaly is usually listed merely as club foot
and is not categorized as to type. Such
brevity was rare during 1951-55. Yearly
incidence values for club foot (all types) are
shown in Table 2. For comparative reasons,

Social Biology

the incidence is also given for cleft lip with
or without cleft palate.

The absence of the orthopedic examinations during 1956-61 apparently resulted in
the under-reporting of minor malformations.
For this reason, the incidence values reported here are more valid for those malformations that are obvious at birth, not
only to the attending physicians but also to
the nurses who care for the infants in the
nursery. Incidence values for these malformations are summarized in Table 3,

The use of the nursery records obviously
leads to a biased estimate of the incidence
of any malformation increasing the probability of fetal death. An example is
anencephaly. An anencephalic fetus is rarely
carried to term. It is born dead or dies
shortly after birth; hence, it would tend not
to be registered in the nursery with the live
births. Only 6 cases were reported in the
nursery records (3 males and 3 females)
giving an incidence of 0.10 per 1,000. The
incidence of anencephaly will be higher if
records of fetal deaths are included. For example, using live births and stillbirths, Neel
(1958) found an incidence of 0.63 per 1,000
for the Japanese; Chung and Myrianthopoulos (1968) observed an incidence of 1.40
per 1,000 for Caucasians in the United
States; and Adams and Niswander (1968)
noted 0.32 per 1,000 for the American
Indians.

The incidence of multiple malformations
involving more than one system (71 cases)
was 1.19 per 1,000, with a sex ratio favoring
males (42 males, 29 females). The frequency
among total malformed infants was 5.8%.
If club foot is removed from the calculations, the frequency among the total malformed infants is increased to 9.6%. Even
though major multiple malformations may
increase the probability of fetal death, the
observed incidence value and frequency
among total malformed infants are relatively similar to those observed in other studies

based on live and stillbirths. Multiple malformations were reported in 8.3% of the
malformed Japanese (Neel, 1958), 4.3% and
12.8% of the malformed American Negroes
and whites, respectively (Chung and Myrianthopoulos, 1968), and 6.8% of the malformed American Indians (Adams and
Niswander, 1968).

The data of Table 1 lend themselves to TABLE 4

the calculations of incidence values for various malformations, A comparison can also
be made for males and females. Because of
the close knit nature of the population in
Utah, it is usually possible to do follow-up
studies of the infants. This was demonstrated by a genetic study of malformations
involving the radial component of the arm.
Genetic syndromes have been well defined
where congenital absence of the radius may
be one of the anomalies (McKusick, 1968).
In order to estimate how frequently an infant is born with a missing radius, the

missing radius, giving an incidence of 2 in
59,651, or about 1 in 30,000. Birch-Jensen
(1948) found that the prevalence of congenital absence of the radius in the adult
population of Denmark is about 1 in 55,000.
Because of the high mortality in these cases
during the first two decades of life, he estimated that the incidence at birth is near 1 in
30,000. It is of interest that his postulated
value agrees so well with the one obtained
in this study.

Of importance are incidence values that
characterize racial groups. The Japanese
show a high incidence of cleft lip with or
without cleft palate (Neel, 1958). The
American Negro is noted for a very high incidence of polydactyly. Using birth certificates in Baltimore, Maryland, as the
source material, Frazier (1960) showed that
nonwhites have a higher total malformation
rate than whites; however, if polydactyly
cases are removed from both samples, the
total rate is higher among whites. This trend
was also noted by Chung and Myrianthopoulos (1968). The data of Adams and
Niswander (1968) suggest that the American Indian also has a relatively high incidence of polydactyly (2.45 per 1,000). The
population in Utah attending the Latter-day
Saints Hospital shows incidence values expected of a Caucasian population. Incidence rates for cleft lip and polydactyly, and
other major malformations apparent at
birth, are of the same magnitude reported
for other Caucasian populations, when reporting differences are considered (Neel, 1958;

Chung and Myrianthopoulos, 1968). This
fact enhances the nursery records as a source
for obtaining control values for genetic
studies. These control values may also be
useful in the long range study of any possible induced mutation in the Utah population because of its proximity to the Nevada
site for the testing of atomic devices.

SUMMARY

Nursery records on file in the Latter-day
Saints Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah,
were used to obtain incidence values for
various congenital malformations for the
years 1951-61. The population of Utah is
largely Caucasian, with a well-defined structure because of the impact of the Mormon
church.

The nursery records yield valid incidence
rates for major malformations readily
diagnosed in live births. These incidence
values are of the same magnitude as those
obtained for other Caucasian populations.
These values are useful for obtaining control
values in genetic studies.

Evidence for subjectivity in the diagnosis
of club foot and hip dysplasia is well documented in the nursery records. This points
out the need of similar methods of diagnosis
and reporting in any comparative studies of
the incidence of certain types of anomalies.
