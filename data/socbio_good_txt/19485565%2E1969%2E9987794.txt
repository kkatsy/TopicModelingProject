Oral Contraception, Coital Frequency,
and the Time Required to Conceive

Two presumed effects of the oral contraceptive are its potentiality for enhancing the
marital sexual relationship and, paradoxically, its potentiality for increasing fertility.
Women frequently attribute improved or
increased marital relations to the reduction
of anxiety about undesired pregnancy.
Many also believe that the pill makes them
physiologically more capable of conceiving
after they discontinue it; indeed, the treatment of sterility with the use of progesterones was an important impetus to the development of the contraceptive. The scientific evidence! is very mixed and inconclusive both because of the methodological
problems in measuring these effects and the
inadequacies of research designs and types
of samples that have been used.

Two recent sample survey studies of fertility in the United States have collected
data relevant to these questions. These
studies, although not focused primarily on
these questions, represent a distinct improvement over most of the small clinical
studies providing the bulk of current evidence. We will discuss first the relation of
the pill to the frequency of marital relations,

these effects, see Wallach and Garcia, 1967, 1968.

 

THE PILL AND COITAL FREQUENCY

Although it is possible that the various
side effects of the pill are common enough
to decrease sexual activity, the opposite
point of view is usually suggested in the
literature on this subject.” There are several
reasons why the adoption of this modern
method might result in a significant increase
in marital sexual activity: (1) The reduction
of anxiety about pregnancy removes a
potentially serious impairment of coital
activity. (2) The physical separation of
contraception from the sexual act may increase spontaneity and enjoyment. (3) The
biochemical action of the progesterone
component of the pill may increase female
libido.

The evidence thus far assembled on this
question has been inconclusive, either
because of small or unrepresentative samples or because of various methodological
limitations complicating the analysis, such
as the absence of “before” and “after”
measurement or the lack of an adequate
control group.

The evidence that we can contribute to

speculation about the implication of advances in

this subject comes as a by-product of two
large-scale sample survey studies of human
fertility, the main objectives of which are to
understand the social factors affecting
reproduction. Most of the information
(collected through interviews) in these studies concerns fertility, fecundity, and contraceptive and fertility-planning histories.
Our data concerning sexual behavior are
derived from single questions addressed to
the wife on the frequency of coitus with her
husband during a recent period of time.
From the demographic perspective, the
chief interest in such matters has been the
relationship between coital frequency and
the chance of conception and, to a lesser
extent, the study of the acceptability of
different contraceptive methods, one component of which is the frequency of coitus
and other aspects of sexual behavior.

Although the research objectives of the
two studies are essentially similar, they differ in research design in ways important for
our present interest. The principal difference
is that one, the so-called Princeton Fertility
Study (PFS), is based on a longitudinal design in which women were interviewed first
in 1957, six months after the birth of their
second child, reinterviewed in 1960, and reinterviewed again toward the end of their
reproductive period (between 1963 and
1967). The other study, known as the 1965
National Fertility Study (NFS), was a
cross-sectional one-time survey of a sample
of married women at all stages of childbearing. Both studies were based on probability
samples of married women living with their
husbands although the PFS was confined to
an initial sample of 1,165 couples living in
seven of the largest metropolitan areas of
the United States, whereas the NFS was
designed as a national sample of some
5,600 women.?

behavior, our report is confined to married couples
exclusively since our data were collected as a byproduct of studies of marital fertility.

RELIABILITY OF MEASUREMENT

Our analysis begins with some findings
based on the larger national sample of the
NFS and concludes with data from the
PFS, exploiting that study’s advantage of
permitting “before” and “after”? measurements of coital frequency. But first a comment is appropriate on the reliability of
measurement of coital frequency. The
question asked in NFS was: “In the past
four weeks, how many times have you had
intercourse?’ How much confidence should
be placed in the reliability of such information? In order to answer such questions
about many variables of interest in fertility
surveys, we drew a simple random subsample of 408 women from the 5,617 initially
interviewed and reinterviewed them approximately four months later with the
same set of questions. (Only the responses
of the 354 women under 45 are represented
here.) It is clear, of course, that the time
referent is different and that there could be
genuine change, for instance, because of
childbirth or the husband’s absence, as well
as general temporal variability. For this
reason, our estimates of reliability are
minimal, and perhaps the more appropriate
view is to regard the reported measure as a
reflection of stability of behavior (or the
perception of behavior) as well as reliability
of measurement.‘ In any event, our main

3The Princeton Fertility Study has been supported chiefly by the Carnegie Corporation, and the
1965 National Fertility Study has been supported by
the National Institutes of Child Health and Human
Development. Both studies received supplementary
grants from the Population Council. Both studies
have been part of the research program of the Office
of Population Research of Princeton University.
For further details on the sample and other findings
of the Princeton Fertility Study, see Westoff et al.,
1961, 1963. Information about the NFS sample and
estimates of various characteristics of women using

oral contraceptives are reported in Ryder and Westoff, 1965.

‘Another factor reducing these measures of
consistency is the report of frequency as a range at
either one or both interviews. The way range responses were coded could result in situations in which
two responses would be considered “‘inconsistent”’ by
our measures even though one was completely included within the other.

concern here is whether there is any important difference in the consistency of reporting coital frequency for women using the pill
compared with women using other methods
of contraception which could affect the comparability of changes over time in the coital
frequency of the two groups. Perhaps pill
users, being generally better educated,
might report more reliably.

higher mean (and variance) of coital fre

ency of reporting by women using the pill
could be due to the higher frequency of a
younger group; it is easier to be consistent
when the behavior reported is less frequent.

RESULTS

We note in Table 2 that the mean coital
frequency of 9.2 reported by women taking
the pill exceeds the average for women using
all other methods of contraception (6.6) by
39%. The average for women currently
using no method of contraception is 6.1.
This is a heterogeneous category, included
mainly for completeness, which includes

Contrary to our expectation, the measures
of individual consistency give higher values
for women reporting other methods than for
women using the pill. Perhaps sexual relations are remembered more accurately when
connected with coitus-related methods rather than with the pill or with no method, or
perhaps pill users are more likely to be in a
phase of the family life cycle where there is
more variability in coital frequency.
Although the association between the
two reports over the four-month interval
seems quite low, there is not enough of a
difference between the consistency of women using the pill and those using other methods to warrant concern over the aggregate
comparisons, The somewhat lower consist
such diverse groups as women who were
pregnant, trying to become pregnant or
risking pregnancy, and those who had no
need for contraception because of subfecundity.

The 39% difference among all women
under 45 is inflated by the fact that younger
women are both more likely to use the pill
and to have a higher coital frequency than
older women. However, when age is controlled, there is still a considerable (though
smaller) difference between women who use
the pill and those who use other methods.
This difference is highest among women
under 25 (a 29% difference), but there is
still a 20% difference among the older
women,

seems to vary both in the educational and
in the religious dimension. The higher the
education, the more difference the pill seems
to make, but an age control would be necessary to interpret this finding. For white
Catholic women the rate is 45% higher for
those using the pill; for white non-Catholic
women it is 34% higher. This difference is
due at least in part to the effect of religious
beliefs on the more extensive Catholic reliance on the rhythm method, which is in
turn associated with lower coital frequency.

What interpretation of the difference
between the coital frequency of women
using the pill and women using other methods should be offered? Can the difference be
attributed directly to the properties of the
pill, both psychological and physiological?
This conclusion does not necessarily follow,
since we have no basis for precluding the
possibility that couples with higher rates of
coital frequency may be more likely to select
the pill because of its unobtrusiveness than
those with lower rates. Since we cannot assign women randomly to experimental and
control groups, we will never really be
able to satisfy the objection that selection
may operate, because, even if the two groups
reported the same frequency prior to the use
of the pill by one of them, the argument
could still be advanced that the women who
adopted the pill had a higher desired frequency than the other women, but repressed it until their adoption of the pill
removed the obstacles to its attainment.
Nevertheless, even though it would not
provide a final solution to the problem of
selection on “‘desired frequency,” the plausibility of our inference about the effect of the
pill would be greatly improved if we had a
“before” and “after” report of women who
did and who did not adopt the pill. This
opportunity is afforded by data from the
Princeton Fertility Study (PFS).

In 1957, a probability sample of 1,165
married white women who six months earlier had given birth to their second child

were Interviewed. The initial sample was
confined to seven of the largest metropolitan
areas of the United States, but these women
were reinterviewed regardless of subsequent
change of residence. In 1960, 905 of the
original sample were successfully reinterviewed; from 1963-67, six to ten years after
the first contact, a total of 814 women were
reinterviewed for the third and last time as
they approached the end of their reproductive life. The completion rates were higher
than these numbers imply (81% and 93%
for the two interviews, respectively) because women whose marriages were dissolved were classified as ineligible for reinterview. The third and final interview was
spread over five years because the oldest
women were interviewed first and the
youngest women last.

The data relevant to this analysis are
derived from a question on coital frequency
asked in the second interview and repeated
in the third interview: ‘In recent months,
about how frequently have you and your
husband had intercourse? I mean on the
average, of course.”’ Although the wording
of the question is different from that used in
the NFS, the averages are strikingly similar. The mean coital frequency reported by
women in the PFS in the third interview is
7.5 for women using the pill and 6.5 for
women using other methods. The corresponding averages from the NFS for similar
women (white, aged 30-39, who had at least
two births) are 7.6 and 6.4, for users of the
pill and other methods respectively.

The comparisons of interest are those
between the coltal frequency rates of 69
women before and after they began using
the pill (1960 and 1963-67 respectively)
and between the rates at comparable times
for the 354 women who used other methods.
Since the pill is used more by younger
women who normally have a higher average
coital frequency even within this relatively
homogeneous group aged 30-39, we calculated a rate standardized on the age

distribution of women using the pill in order
to control any effect of age on the comparison of the two categories of women.

The main observations from Table 3
are: (1) a 5% increase in mean coital frequency over the five to six years for women
who used the pill; (2) a 10% decrease over
the same time period for women who used
other methods of contraception; (3) no evidence that women with an initially high
frequency were attracted to the pill. Given
the small number of cases, the change in
frequency among women using the pill is
not large enough to be statistically significant using the ¢ test for the significance of

to the pill} It is quite impossible from these
data and this type of study to determine
the relative importance of social, psychological, or biochemical factors in causing this
difference.

TIME REQUIRED FOR CONCEPTION

There has been a good deal of speculation
and some fragmentary evidence suggesting
that the use of oral progesterones facilitates
conception after discontinuation; indeed,
one of the earliest uses of these drugs was
for the promotion of fertility among women
of low fecundity, because these compounds
regularize the ovulatory cycle and thus

differences between means; but the decrease
among women using other methods is significant at the 0.001 level. Prior to the use of
the pill, the difference between the mean
frequencies for the two categories of women
is 0.1 in the opposite direction and not
statistically significant, but at reinterview
the difference is 1.0 in the predicted direction and significant at the 0.02 level.

In summary, it seems clear from the
analysis that the pill does make a difference
in coital frequency and that the 18-20%
difference for women aged 25-44 observed
in the 1965 National Fertility Study (Table
2) is quite consistent with the difference
between the rate for women of comparable
age in the Princeton Fertility Study using
the pill (7.5) and the rate they theoretically
might have had (6.3) if they had not shifted

The data available from the 1965 National Fertility Study provide an opportunity to test the hypothesis that women
who have used the pill conceive faster after
discontinuing use than women who discontinue other methods in order to conceive.

SOME PROBLEMS OF SELECTIVITY

To compare the conception waiting
times in the two types of experience requires
imposing several statistical controls to
minimize various possibilities that women
who had adopted the pill differ from women

women using other methods to the mean of 7.1 for
women who subsequently adopted the pill.

Vol. 16, No. I

using more traditional methods in ways that
could distort the comparison.

There is the possibility that women using
the pill might be more fecund since they are
younger than women using other methods.
The best protection against this bias would
be to confine the comparisons to women
who were of similar age at the time they
discontinued contraception in order to
conceive. This control can be reasonably
approximated by restricting the analysis to
comparisons specific for pregnancy order.
At the time of the interruption of contraception for a first pregnancy, women who
had used the pill were 21.3 years of age on
the average as compared with a mean age of
21.8 for women who had used other methods. The corresponding mean ages for the
second pregnancy are 23.3 and 24.0, respectively. Later planned pregnancy orders do
not include enough women who had used the
pill to permit comparison.

There is also the more troublesome possibility of memory bias; women who interrupt the pill might be apt to remember the
event more accurately than women interrupting other methods, since the former is
a more radical change in behavior. Whether
this memory difference would operate to
shorten or lengthen the time period recalled
is not clear. Unfortunately the number of
women (7) represented in our reinterview
sample who deliberately interrupted the
pill in order to become pregnant is too small
to permit any comparative analysis. It is
clear, however, that the reliability of such
data in general is low enough to warrant
concern. For planned first pregnancies in our
sample (even restricting the comparison
to women who consistently reported that
contraception was used and that the pregnancy was planned), only 62% reported the
same number of months required to conceive
after interrupting contraception. If the
definition of consistency is relaxed to include
responses differing by one month, a total of
82% replied consistently. The correspond
Oral Contraception 7

ing estimates for planned second pregnancies are 59% and 76%, respectively.

One control imposed on memory bias,
was to confine comparisons to recent pregnancy intervals; only pregnancies terminating since June 1, 1961 are included in our
analysis. This truncation should reduce
recall error. This date was selected because
the pill was licensed for sale in 1960, and our
analysis focuses on time required for conception occurring after contraception is
deliberately interrupted. This truncation
restricts the intervals of women using other
methods to a time period after the introduction of the pill.

Even when the above biases are controlled, there remain other differences
between pill users and women who used
other methods which lead to an expectation
of shorter conception times for women who
used the pill—quite apart from any direct
physiological effects of the compound itself.

DIFFERENCES IN COITAL FREQUENCY

The first section of this paper indicates
that women who use the pill tend to have
higher rates of coital frequency than women
using other methods. Insofar as conception
time is related to rates of coital frequency,
this factor might lead to an expectation of
shorter intervals for women who had used
the pill. However, since we asked only the
one question on coital frequency in the past
four weeks, our data do not include any such
measurement relevant to the conception
times under consideration. Therefore, the
best we can do is to compare, for women
currently trying to become pregnant, the
rates reported by women whose most recent
method used was the pill with those of women who have interrupted the use of other
methods.

Since the women who had used the pill are
much younger, the coital frequency for
women interrupting other methods was adjusted to the age distribution of pill users.
The mean frequency (in the preceding four
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

8 Westoff, Bumpass, and Ryder

weeks) for women who had interrupted the
pill is 11.7; the mean for women who had
interrupted other methods standardized on
the age distribution of the younger women
who had used the pill is 8.6.®

The next obvious question is whether a
difference of this magnitude at this level has
any influence on the probability of conception. The answer to this question involves
many complexities, such as the assumed
length of the fertile period, the length of
the menstrual cycle, and the distribution of
coitus throughout the cycle. A series of
estimates of such probabilities has been
prepared based on different assumptions of
these distributions; from these we infer that
an average difference of between nine and
twelve times a month could be expected to
reduce the average waiting time from either
two or three months to one month if coitus
were concentrated in the middle of the
month,’ Thus, it is possible that part of any
observed difference in waiting times could
simply reflect differences in coital frequency
rather than any physiological factor. At
best, however, this is fairly speculative,
given all of the assumptions about the relationship of coital frequency and the probability of conception, as well as the assumption that the differences in coital frequency
of women currently using the pill and different methods represent other women’s past
experience.

DIFFERENCES IN KNOWLEDGE OF

THE OVULATORY CYCLE
Considering the fact that women who
adopt the pill tend to be more educated
than women who adopt or remain with more
conventional methods, any difference in the
rates of conception between the two groups

6 The unadjusted mean is 7.0.

7 The two values of two and three months reflect
respectively a broad and peaked fertile period. These
estimates are based on the strong assumption that
the women are trying to get pregnant (as is the case
in our study) and therefore concentrate coitus in the
middle of the cycle. See Lachenbruch, 1967.

Social Biology

might also be influenced by the greater
knowledge of the ovulatory cycle by women
using the pill. If, for example, a monthly
coital frequency of ten is concentrated
around the middle of the cycle, the average
waiting time for conception would be one or
two months (depending upon the assumed
distribution of the fertile period) compared
with an average of three months if the
probability of coitus is equal for any day of
the cycle (Lachenbruch, 1967, p. 30). Other
distributions of coitus, such as those that
might occur for couples with erroneous information about time of ovulation, could
result in much longer waiting times.

Our data permit us to determine whether,
in fact, women who have used the pill are
more knowledgeable about the ovulatory
cycle than those who used other methods by
comparing their responses to the question:
“If a woman has her period every 28 days,
on which day does she have the greatest
chance of becoming pregnant, counting
from the first day her period begins?”

We have used two definitions of the
“correct” answer: a narrow definition,
including only responses completely enclosed in the range 13-15 days, and a broad
definition counting as correct any answer
falling in or overlapping with the range of
12-16 days. According to the narrow definition, 58% of the women who planned their
last pregnancy after interrupting the pill
gave the “correct” answer compared with
48%, of the women who had used other
methods of contraception. The corresponding results for the broad definition of accurate response are 69% and 64%.

Although the differences are in the
expected direction, they do not appear
large enough to account for much variation
in conception rates between the two groups.
We also note that a substantial proportion
of the women, whatever the method used,
are ignorant of ovulation time.

RESULTS

Our interview schedule contained questions designed to permit an approximate
separation of each pregnancy interval into
components of contraceptive and noncontraceptive exposure for women who had
deliberately interrupted contraception in
order to conceive. The total interval, after
subtracting time pregnant and in postpartum, is decomposed into contraceptive
exposure and the interval between the time

of women who had used conventional methods occurred earlier in time, whereas women
who interrupted use of the pill are concentrated in the later part of this interval.
Consequently, women who interrupted conventional methods have had a much greater
opportunity to experience longer waiting
times than those who interrupted the pill.
This bias can be dealt with by conventional
life table procedures in which the probability of “surviving” any given month is

* Because of the recency of the introduction of the pill, the data are confined to women who interrupted contraception between

June, 1961, and September, 1965,

contraception was interrupted and conception. This waiting time is estimated from
the answers to the question: ‘How many
months after you stopped using a method
did you become pregnant?” For women who
are currently trying to become pregnant
(a somewhat higher proportion being pill
users) but who had not succeeded by the
time of interview, the waiting time information derives from the question: “How
Jong ago did you stop using a method?”

Even during the limited period of time
concerned (June, 1961 to September, 1965)
a much greater proportion of the experience

based only upon the experience of women
exposed to that month. The cumulative
probability of remaining not pregnant
through a given month is the cumulative
product of the preceding monthly probabilities of survival (see Potter, 1966).

The number of women with over six
months of exposure is insufficient to permit
reliable estimates of the monthly probability
of conception beyond the sixth month.
Consequently, mean conception times in Table 4 are based only on the first six months
of exposure. The probability of remaining
nonpregnant through the twelfth month is

presented for general reference, but is based
on insufficient cases to be statistically
reliable.

Two things should be noted from Table 4.
In the first place, contrary to our expectations, mean conception times are not shorter
for women who interrupted the pill than for
women who interrupted other methods.
Considering the data for all four pregnancy
orders combined, 85% of the pill users were
pregnant by the end of six months and their
mean waiting time was 2.3 months, whereas
for those using other methods 87% were
pregnant by the end of six months, and their
mean waiting time was 2.1 months. The
differences are in the same direction when
comparisons are made specific for pregnancy
order, although the size of the difference
between means is larger.

Second, we note from Table 4 that the
distributions of waiting time for pill users
and others differ in one particular regard:
Pill users are less likely to report getting
pregnant during the first month of exposure.

Social Biology

Again considering the example of the first
four pregnancies combined, 46% of the
women using other methods and 37% of the
pill users report waiting times of one month
or less. This difference, if reliable, could result from reporting differences between the
two groups. In the first place, there may be
misreporting of the circumstances of pregnancy. An accidental pregnancy reported as
“planned” would contribute the shortest
possible interval—and the likelihood of such
misreporting would be greater for women
using less effective methods than for women
using the pill. Second, there may be differences related to sophistication between the
two groups in interpretation of the question
of how long it takes to become pregnant.

Taking into account all of the above, it is
our considered conclusion that there is no
difference in the time required to conceive
between women who have used the pill and
women who have used other methods of
contraception.
