ABSTRACT: The central issue of this analysis is whether the relationship between modernization
and fertility is isomorphic across different parities. Results from bivariate and multivariate
analyses of the 32 states of Mexico in 1970 reveal parity differentials in the relationship between
modernization and fertility. In general, at the bivariate level, significant inverse relationships
are obtained between modernization indicators and parities 5 and above. However, at the lower
parities both negative and positive, and mostly insignificant results are obtained. Regression
analyses reveal that indeed a model based strictly on socioeconomic development is less robust
at lower parities, and particularly robust for middle-range parities. In both bivariate and multivariate analyses, the relationship between an aggregated measure of fertility, the average number of children ever born per woman, and modernization appears to be weakened by the
mixed and indeterminant behavior of lower parities in response to modernization. We suggest
that these mixed and indeterminant results at the lower end of the parity continuum are due to

the combined and opposite effects of modernization on subfecundity and social behavior.

There is little doubt that fertility transitions over time and differentials at one
point in time are associated with social
and economic development. The intricacies of this relationship have attracted
much research, an attraction due in part
to its relevance for demographic transition theory. Implicit in the literature is
the assertion that changes in family
structure and fertility declines are ultimate outcomes of socioeconomic development. However, as Friedlander and
his colleagues (1979, p. 239), as well as
others, have pointed out, ‘While this
proposition is indisputable in the long
run, critical questions remain relating to
the short-run impact of socioeconomic
development on the onset and pace of
fertility decline, and to the identification
of the specific mechanisms that link
socioeconomic development to fertility
changes.”

Surprisingly, cross-national studies
have reported contradictory results. In
their review of the literature, Bollen and
Entwisle (1981) point out that a significant negative relationship between social and economic development and fertility is in fact not consistently supported
in cross-national research. Some studies
report positive associations for the
fertility/development relationship
(Weintraub, 1962; Adelman, 1963;
Heer, 1966; Gregory and Campbell,
1976); other studies report negative
results (UN, 1965; Kirk, 1971; Beaver,
1975; Hohm, 1975): and some studies
show mixed and indeterminant results
(Friedlander and Silver, 1967; Janowitz,
1971; Ekahem, 1972). Most surprising,
of the multivariate studies in the Bollen
and Entwisle (1981) review only

and Campbell (1976), and Adelman

(1963) report statistically significant
results. As Bollen and Entwisle (1981,
p. 5) conclude, research to date is inconsistent with ‘“expectations based on theory, historical research and policy assertions.”

Cutright and Kelly (1978) suggest
that previous research has been plagued
by such difficulties as small and illdefined samples, limited theoretical per
_Sspectives, and multicollinearity among
=the modernization variables. Moreover,
“most cross-national research on the
odernization/fertility relationship employ simplistic measures of fertility due
Ato poor data accessibility in most coun“tries, particularly the less developed.
SThe most widely used measure is the
ciCrude Birth Rate (for a few examples

Sand Kirk, 1975; Beaver, 1975; Freed‘Sman and Berelson, 1976; and Cutright
2and Kelly, 1978). Less frequently used
Tare age-specific fertility rates (Adelman,
£1963), the child-woman ratio (Heer and
oTurner, 1965; Kasarda, 1971), the Gross
‘EReproduction Rate (UN, 1965; Jano—witz, 1971), the General Fertility Rate
B(Heer, 1966; World Bank, 1974; Srikan“Stan, 1977), and the Total Fertility Rate
‘S(Hohm, 1975). No study, to our knowlSedge, has attempted to relate modernieration to a particular fertility outcome,
with the exception of recent studies concerning the relationship between modernization and childlessness (Romaniuk, 1980; Poston and Trent, in press;
Poston et al., in press).

In an attempt to address some of
these issues, this paper explores the relationship between socioeconomic development and parity distribution in the
states of Mexico in 1970. Since the mid1940’s and continuing through most of
the 1970’s, Mexico has been experienc

ing social and economic development
(Reynolds, 1970; Solis, 1970; Forsyth
and Ramirez, 1981). Despite this
growth, substantial intra-national differences remain. Thus, Mexico provides a
more than adequate setting in which to
explore the variability in modernization
and its relationship to parity distribution.

THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES
THE TRADITIONAL PERSPECTIVE

According to an orthodox interpretation of demographic transition theory,
socioeconomic development is positively related to the occurrence of lower
parities in a population. Many argue
that social and economic development
have induced fertility declines leading
to the completion of the demographic
transition in nineteenth-century European society (Davis, 1945, 1949, 1955;
Notestein, 1953). A brief and simple
synopsis of the theory based largely on
the European experience is that mortality rates begin to decline with the onset
of modernization, and high fertility
rates eventually follow suit. The declines in mortality occur with social and
technological improvement such as improved health care and medical technology, higher standards of nutrition, increased production and dissemination
of food, and improved channels of communication and transportation. Modernization weakens traditional kinship
ties, alters traditional sex roles, early
age at marriage, and family size. In addition to increased contraceptive use, all
these factors influence fertility decline
during the demographic transition. Although there has been considerable debate as to the adequacy and universality
of demographic transition theory

210 Trent

(Coale, 1973; Freedman, 1979; Teitlebaum, 1975; Knodel and Van de Walle,
1979), the historical account is usually
extended to present-day analyses under
the assumption that the modernization
process will eventually lead to fertility
declines in less developed areas (See
Cutright et al., 1976, p. 511).

In sum, based on a classical interpretation of demographic transition theory,
one would expect modernization to increase fertility at the lower parities while
reducing fertility at the high parities. Indeed, if socioeconomic development
creates inducements for smaller family
size, levels of development should be directly related to the levels of low parity
women in a given population. Figure 1
illustrates what we refer to as the relationship between parity and modernization adopting a classical version of demographic transition theory.

Along these same lines of thought, aggregated measures of fertility such as the
Crude Birth Rate, General Fertility
Rate, and child/woman ratio (which do
not directly account for parity distribution) should be negatively related to social and economic development. In the
next section we present an alternative to
this interpretation, drawing heavily
from recent research on the structural
determinants of childlessness, and the
relationships among modernization,
subfecundity, and fertility outcomes.

 

Social Biology

AN ALTERNATIVE PERSPECTIVE

Some authors have suggested that an
increase in fertility may result at early
stages of social and economic development (Henin, 1969; Olusanya, 1969;
Romaniuk, 1969). Most recent crossnational research on the determinants of
fertility decline do not address the possible simultaneous positive effect of these
determinants. Romaniuk (1968, p. 214)
argued that ‘‘many of the earlier writings on African demography were devoted to problems of infertility and depopulation in tropical Africa; in
contrast, the present tendency is rather
to emphasize problems connected with
high fertility.” He argued that an important minority of African populations,
the infertile, have been ignored. In this
regard, McFalls (1979, p. 21) has described subfecundity as “the shallow
niche within population fertility thinking.”

Infertility, or any form of subfecundity, in a developing region is typically
measured by the per cent of childlessness in a population. While the per cent
of childlessness can only serve as an underestimation of the extent of subfecundity in a population, the measure nonetheless provides a minimal and ofttimes
surprising indication of the extent of
subfecundity. For example, Romaniuk
(1968) reported that in the region of Bas
Uele in the Congo, 50 per cent of

women over 45 years of age had never
conceived a child; in 1960 among Moslems of northern Cameroon 35 per cent
of women aged 25-45 years were childless; in 1952 a sample of Buganda
women in Uganda revealed 31.6 per
cent of women 45 years of age and over
were childless, and among women 25
years and over of the Bobo of Upper
Volta a childless rate near 25 per cent
has been reported.

More recently, Frank (1983) warned
of the potential impact of subfecundity
on population growth in Sub-Saharan
Africa. She indicated that as much as a
15 per cent increase in total fertility
could result if levels of subfecundity are
diminished. The per cent of women
childless at the end of childbearing 1s estimated to be as high as 17.3 per cent in
the Centra] African Republic, 20.5 per
cent in the Congo and Zaire, and 32.0
per cent in Gabon (Frank, 1983).

While most reports of the extent of
subfecundity in developing regions have
focused on Africa, Poston and Trent
(1983) investigated the phenomenon
cross-nationally. They reported circa1970 census-based rates as high as 20 per
cent in Bangladesh, 18 per cent in Mozambique and Nepal, and 17 per cent in
Bermuda, Indonesia, and Peru among
women aged 15~49. More specifically,
among women who had completed their
childbearing (ages 45-49), childlessness
rates as high as 26 per cent for Martinique, and 16 per cent for Mozambique
were reported. In later analyses of
World Fertility Survey data, Poston and
his colleagues (1983) found definite
evidence that among a sample of fourteen developing nations, little, if any, of
the reported childlessness was voluntary. In fact, it was demonstrated that
over 90 per cent of the permanent child

lessness reported in Mexico was involuntary.

The extent of childlessness in developing nations has been well documented, and some studies have attempted to account for the causes and/or
possible impact of the phenomenon on
population growth. Poston and Trent
(in press) investigated the relationship
between childlessness and socioeconomic development in 36 developing
countries for the circa-1970 time period.
Modernization was conceptualized in
terms of structural development, health
conditions, and female status. The relationships between these three socioeconomic indicators and the rate of marital
childlessness were negative. The health
conditions component showed the
strongest influence, confirming the authors’ theoretical argument that involuntary childlessness predominates in
less developed countries (see also Poston et al., 1983). Not surprisingly,
we may conclude that subfecundity appears to be negatively associated with
modernization.

A most persuasive explanation put
forth for understanding fertility trends
in individual developing countries emphasized the role of subfecundity. Romaniuk (1980) examined the early
stages of modernization and its impact
on natural fertility from the mid-1950’s
to the mid-1970’s in the country of Zaire
and its regions. During this twenty-year
period, characterized by improvements
in the provision of health services and
reduction in malnutrition, “populations
in which formerly infertility was high experienced a dramatic reduction in childlessness”” (Romaniuk, 1980, p. 304).
More recently, Tabutin (1982) reported
that, over the course of twenty years, areas of Western Zaire have experienced

substantial fertility increases in the
midst of increasing social and economic
development. The author attributed
one of the major causes of this phenomenon to decreasing levels of endemic
Sterility.

Most relevant to the study at handisa
subnational investigation of childlessness in Mexico. Poston and his colleagues (in press) found that among the
32 states of Mexico in 1970, levels of
modernization were negatively related
to childlessness. Four factors of modernization were identified: one clearly
reflecting health conditions and the
other three indicators of various structural economic dimensions. The health
conditions dimension of modernization
proved the more influential predictor of
childlessness.

If modernization (particularly health
components of modernization) has been
shown to be negatively associated with
chiidlessness, then it becomes reasonable to expect a similar relationship to
occur among other low parities in developing areas of the world. This argument
is founded not only on the implications
of the above mentioned studies, but also
on evidence of repeated problem pregnancies reported in many studies. We
turn now to a discussion of subfecundity
and low parity outcomes.

Repeated pregnancy loss has been
linked to chronic maternal disease, inadequate nutrition and hygiene, low levels of education and income, and other
indicators of depressed socioeconomic
conditions (Schneider, 1973). Subfecundity as a whole is due primarily to genetic factors, psychopathology, disease,
nutritional deficiencies, and environmental factors (McFalls, 1979). The
principal causes of subfecundity in the
developing world today are disease and
nutritional deficiencies which are ‘“‘com

pounded by the relative absence of quality health care and facilities” (McFalls,
1979, p. 7).

Many studies have indicated that
women who have experienced such difficulties as infertility, ectopic pregnancy,
spontaneous abortion, and fetal death,
are likely repeatedly to exhibit problem
pregnancies. Also, women with a history of infertility tend to have negative
outcomes if they do conceive (see Schneider, 1973; NCHS, 1965; Niswander
and Gordon, 1972; and Shapiro et al.,
1962, 1965, for more thorough discussions on repeated pregnancy loss). The
pattern of repeated pregnancy loss suggests that the achievement of high parity
women in a given population serves as
testimony to the fecundity of those
women.

Thus, an alternative framework for
explaining differentials in the relationship between parity and modernization
in developing areas emerges. If modernization has been shown to be negatively
related to childlessness in developing
countries, then, as we have argued, it
becomes reasonable to expect a similar
relationship to occur among other low
parities. However, at the other end of
the continuum, modernization and parity may indeed be negatively related as
classical modernization theory would
predict; the higher the parity, the less
likely the presence and influence of subfecundity. Figure 2 demonstrates our argument. The relationship between socioeconomic development and fertility
may indeed be a parity-specific relationship. If such is the case, measures of fertility which mask parity specific issues
(such as the Crude Birth Rate and the
General Fertility Rate) could result in
contradictory relationships between fertility and modernization.

count for variability in parity distribution among the 32 states of Mexico in
1970 within a revised theoretical model
of modernization. Rather than use a single, aggregated fertility measure, however, we concentrate on parity-specific
measures. This refinement allows us to
address the central issue—whether the
relationship between modernization
and fertility is isomorphic with respect
to parity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
MEASUREMENT OF PARITY

The data on parity (number of children ever born) were taken from the
1970 Mexican Census, Resumen General Abreviado, Cuadro 23. Thirteen

3 parity rates were constructed for each of

the 32 states of Mexico according to the
following definition:

P, = W,/T X 100

where P, refers to the parity rates, W,
the number of women 15-49 at parity x,
and T is the total number of women
aged 15-49.

Another rate reflecting the total fertility of woman aged 15-49 in 1970 was
computed as follows:

F= C/T

where F represents the average number
of Children Ever Born per woman

(CEB) aged 15—49: C, the total number
of children ever born to women age 1549: and T, the total number of women
aged 15-49.

INDEPENDENT VARIABLES

According to Goldscheider (1971, p.
93), ‘‘the key to understanding modernization begins with the process of structural differentiation, which involves the
evolution of specialized role structures
from multifunctional structures.”” The
common view held is that in the premodern setting the family or kinship
group was relatively self-sufficient.
However, the modernization process
entails the relegation of education,
health services, and economic production outside of the family unit. Thus,
population theory suggests that modernization be conceptualized as consisting of four basic components: urbanization, education, and health and
economic conditions (Goldscheider,
1971; Cutright and Kelly, 1978, 1980;
Kelly et al., 1976). The variables in this
analysis have been chosen to reflect
these four basic components of the modernization process. Twenty independent
variables were used in the analysis representing economic conditions, education, urbanization, and overall health
conditions and facilities of the given
state. These measures are shown in Table 1. The data used in the construction
of these variables were obtained from

and the 1975 Atlas of Mexico.

distribution rates and the social and economic variables, and the bivariate relationships resulting between the ‘‘average number of children’’ and the

does indeed consist of parity differentials. While a few of the bivariate results
emerging between the modernization
indicators and the parity rates reflect
patterns suggested by demographic
transition theory, most do not. For example, as would be expected from transition theory, the per cent economically
active is positively related with Parities 1
through 5; the strongest positive relationships are at Parity 1 and 2. Parities 6
and above show negative correlations
with economic activity. Similar patterns
emerge between the parity rates and the

support the classical version of transitional thought. In these cases levels of
development are positively related
among lower parities and negatively related among the higher.

However, most of the relationships

range parities. For the most part, varied
direction and inconsistent significance
occur among the low parities. This is to
be expected if, as we propose, the effects of fertility inhibiting modernization factors are simultaneously occurring with the fertility-stimulating effects
caused by decreased levels of subfecundity.

Finally, the ‘average number of children” variable is, for the most part, inversely and significantly related to modernization. The higher the level of social
and economic development, the lower
the levels of fertility. For example, the
per cent of the population in professional occupations and the average
number of children born variable are
highly correlated, r = —0.67. Likewise, a strong relationship occurs between the average number of children
born and the number of doctors per
10,000 population and the number of
medical beds per capita (r —0.75 and
r = —0.61, respectively).

In order to reduce the large number
of modernization indicators to reasonable proportions, we chose to factor analyze the twenty independent variables
and regress the measures of fertility on
the emerging factors. Four distinct factors emerged in the analysis. Factor 1,
which we will refer to a Structural Development consists of the per cent literate,
per cent of the population in places of
2,5000+ , 10,000+ , and 100,000+ , and
the per cent of the population in professional occupations, per cent in agricultural activities, per cent females economically active, per cent dwellings
without sewerage, per cent dwellings
with piped water, per capita gasoline
consumption, and per capita sugar consumption. All eleven of these variables
loaded above 0.56; six, above 0.80. The
second factor generally reflected Health

Trent

Social Biology

Conditions: the general mortality rate,
the mortality rate of infectious and parasitic diseases, medical units per capita,
and the per cent of the population nonnative to their state (Factor loadings
were 0.79, 0.68, 0.76, and 0.67, respectively). The third factor is a combination
of three components Medical Care, Economic Activity, and Railroad Transportation. Four variables composed the
third factor, two reflecting medical care,
doctors per 10,000 population, and
medical beds per capita; and the other
two, per cent of the population economically active and kilometers of railroads
per 1,000 square kilomters of land (factor loadings equaled 0.76, 0.55, 0.63,
0.77, respectively). Finally, the fourth
factor reflected Transportation and consisted of a sole variable, kilometers of
paved roads per 1,000 kilometers of
road, which had a factor loading of 0.83.

Table 2 shows the zero-order correlations between the fertility rates and the
four dimensions of modernization. In
this representation we may now more
clearly observe the relationships inferred from Table 1. Immediately apparent is that only Factor 1 and Factor 3
show significant bivariate relationships
with the dependent variables. As expected, Factor 1 which represents structural development, i.e.; literacy, urbanization, economic activity, sanitation,
gasoline, and sugar consumption, is negatively related to every parity represented. Among ‘the low parities, the
higher the levels of modernization, the
lower the levels of 1-, 2-, and 3-child
families. Contrary to what we refer to as
a classical interpretation of demographic transition theory, increases in
levels of structural development are not
indicated here to be associated with increases in small family size. Factor 3 is
positively related to Parities 1, 2,3, and

4, and negatively related to all other
parities represented. Medical care
should be expected to have more sensitive ties to subfecundity than structural
development. Perhaps, in this instance,
the higher the quality of medical care,
the higher the level of women who have
one, two, or three children. This relationship may indicate that the presence
of medical care facilities averts stillbirths, and other types of unsuccessful
pregnancies, and thus this factor may be
directly reflecting the positive effects of
modernization on fertility.

The results from the regression analysis are shown in Table 3. For Parities 1,
2, and 3, the only significant predictor is
Factor 3, and its influence is positive in
all three cases. For Parities 4 and 5, Factor 1 is the only significant predictor,

influence than Factor 3 for Parities 6 and

slightly less influence at Parity 9. For
Parities 10 and above Factor 3 is the only
significant predictor, and it is negative.

Turning to the amount of variance
explained by the socioeconomic development model, we see that the model
works very well for middle-range parities. Sixty-nine per cent of the variance
is explained at Parity 6, 73 per cent at
Parity 7, and 60 per cent at Parity 8.
Also, note that the explained variance
descends monotonically on either side
of Parity 7, except in the case of Parity 1
and 2. It should be emphasized that the
predictive power of Factor 3 at these two
parities is causing the increase in the explained variance.

The average-number-of-children
variable was selected to reflect the type
of measures used in most cross-national
research on the relationship between
fertility and socioeconomic development. As can be seen in Table 3, both

Factor 1 (Structural Development) and
Factor 3 (Medical Care, Economic Activity, and Transportation) are significant and negative predictors of fertility. Fertility and these dimensions of
modernization are negatively related as
modernization theory would predict.
Over half of the variance in fertility is
explained by a model based on socioeconomic development. However,
when overall fertility is broken down by
parity, we see that this model serves well
for middle-range parities, but is less robust for parities on either the lower or
higher end of the continuum. Moreover, the predictive power of the various
dimensions of modernization are dependent upon the parity under consideration.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

This paper has been concerned with
accounting for some of the inconsistencies reported in cross-national research
concerning the relationship between socioeconomic development and fertility.
We chose to analyze the relationship not
only utilizing a measure of fertility similar to those used in past research (average number of children born), but also
to investigate the relationship on a
parity-specific basis.

Results from bivariate and multivariate analyses of the 32 states of Mexico in
1970 revealed parity differentials in the
relationship between modernization
and fertility. In general, significant inverse relationships were obtained between modernization indicators and
Parities 5 and above. However, at the
lower parities, both negative and positive and mostly insignificant results were
obtained, indirectly confirming the inadequacy of a classical demographic

transition interpretation at those levels.
We suggested that mixed and indeterminant results at the lower end of the parity continuum are due to the combined
and opposite effects of modernization
on fertility outcomes of low parity
women. On the one hand, modernization induces incentives for smaller families. On the other, social and economic
development curtails the effects of subfecundity in a population. Thus, the relationship between the average number
of children born variable and modernization appears to be weakened by the
mixed and indeterminant behavior in
lower parities in response to modernization.

Regression analyses revealed that a
model based strictly on socioeconomic
development is indeed more robust at
higher parities, particularly middlerange parities. More importantly, regression analyses showed that the predictive power of the various dimensions
of modernization are dependent upon
parity. Factor 3 (Medical Care, Economic Activity, and Railroads) was the
sole predictor of Parities 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, Factor 1 (Structural Development), which constitutes variables
typically used in research on the
modernization/fertility relationship,
does not become a significant predictor
until Parity 4.

In general, we have found considerable support for our argument emphasizing the role of subfecundity among low
parity women. To the extent that the inferences drawn in this paper are true,
the effects of subfecundity on fertility
deserve the attention of policy planners
in Mexico. As discussed earlier in this
paper, Frank (1983) has warned of the
potential impact of subfecundity on
population growth. Let us reemphasize

220

that Frank predicts as much as a 15 per
cent increase in total fertility could
result if levels of subfecundity are diminished in Sub-Saharan Africa. To the extent that these predictions are generalizable to other developing areas, the
consequences of these relationships may
be reflected in future trends in Mexican
fertility. These consequences should be
more strongly reflected in less developed states such as Chiapas, Guerrero,
Oaxaca, and others, where subfecundity

should have the strongest influence on
fertility outcomes.
