ABSTRACT: From data on consanguineous marriages in Spain for 1911 to 1943 for the whole
country and for four macro regions, the behavior and relationship of consanguinity and demographic variables, such as density, birth rate, death rate, and marriage rate, are demonstrated
and discussed. Differences among macro regions for all the variables analyzed and a constant
inverse and significant relationship between consanguinity level and density have been found. A
clear relationship between socioeconomic development of the regions and consanguinity has not
been found. The influence of each demographic variable in space and time is studied by partial

correlation and multiple regression analyses.

It is a difficult task to describe the main
biological characteristics of the human
population in Spain today using only the
available genetic and demographic information without considering the geographical features and the historical background
of the country. The genetic data are very
complex, in some cases scarce (Dobson et
al., 1967), and sometimes contradictory.
For example, if we take the distribution
of haptoglobin types (Planas et al., 1966;
Pons et al., 1968), we could say that the
Spaniards are very homogeneous. But if
we consider the gene frequency of the
ABO, MN, or Kell blood groups, some
other red cell enzyme polymorphisms
(ADA, AK, 6-PGD, PGM, AP), serum
protein polymorphisms (C3, a@;—at, Pche,
Tf, Gc, Cp), or the frequency of thalassemia (Mourant, 1954; Goedde et al.,
1972, 1973; Cabezas and MartinBarrientos, 1973; Campillo et al., 1973,
Pellicer and Casado, 1970; Lisker et al.,
1967), notable differences exist between
different regions.

35

Sometimes this heterogeneity is explained by the authors as a result of isolation and inbreeding, as for example in the
case of the Basque region in Goedde et al.
(1973). The same authors indicate the importance of relating the biological findings
to anthropological, sociological and historical studies because “even nowadays the
population of Spain appears to be different
from several points of view” (p. 553). The
same complexities and heterogeneity are
found in the demographic data, namely,
natality, mortality, marriage, and migration rates (Daric, 1956; Instituto Nacional
de Estadistica, 1959, 1966; Tapinos,
1966), and the consanguineous marriage
data (Valls, 1962, 1966, 1967, 1969). All of
them bring out the considerable heterogeneity of the country and of its inhabitants.
There are regions or provinces with similar characteristics, but the differences are
also remarkable, not only among different
provinces or regions, but within some
provinces.

In our opinion, therefore, a good ap

proach for studying the population structure of Spain would be to study the variations and causal factors of one single
characteristic in the whole country over an
adequate period of time. We think that
consanguineous marriages could be this
characteristic, because consanguinity levels are indispensable to a study of the
genetic structure of the population and
could be the first step for other researchers
in medical and population genetics
(Cavalli-Sforza, 1960).

On the other hand, many authors in
different parts of the world have shown
the relationships among some demographic variables and the phenomenon of
consanguinity, and the factors that
influence the frequency of consanguineous
marriages (Barrai et al., 1962; Sutter,
1968; Moroni, 1967; Freire-Maia, 1957;
Valls, 1967; Lazo et al., 1970).

In a previous publication (PintoCisternas and Moroni, 1967), several facts
about consanguinity in Spain were demonstrated. However, for different reasons,
that publication was only of a preliminary
nature.

Now we shall analyze the consanguinity
for the whole of Spain, during a period of
33 years (1911—43). We shall also try to
determine: the relationships that exist between this variable and some other demographic variables; the influence, form,
intensity, and direction of each variable
on consanguinity in time as well as in
space; and the relationship of consanguinity to the socioeconomic development of a
geographical zone. For the first and second points, a double analysis is necessary,
i.e., over the whole country and over some
geographical regions, for the complete period, and for some subperiods. For the
third point, it seems adequate to carry out
a comparative analysis of three groups of
provinces, which have had different socioeconomic development. In this paper we
shall discuss the results of some calcula
Social Biology

tions and statistical analyses that we think
could satisfy the objectives of the first and
second points. The third one will be analyzed in a separate paper.

We have chosen a division into regions
for several reasons (historical, geographical, socioeconomic, cultural, linguistic)
which indicate that this is the most appropriate division of Spain rather than some
administrative division, such as civil (provinces) or ecclesiastical (dioceses) (Enciclopedia Universal Espasa Calpe, 1963).
There is a good relationship between geographic and linguistic characteristics and
the classical regions of the country, but
there is a poor relationship between these
same characteristics and the civil and
ecclesiastical divisions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The records of the Catholic consanguineous marriage dispensations granted
in the whole of Spain during the years
considered were taken from the files of the
Sacred Congregation of the Sacraments in
the Vatican. These archives contain all the
dispensations for all sixty dioceses in
which Spain was divided during this period.

As the population of Spain is Catholic,
the total number of Catholic marriages
celebrated probably represents more than
97 per cent of all civil marriages, but there
must exist a number of common-law marriages which are impossible to detect. The
dispensations for consanguineous marriages could be considered to include all
marriages of this type. In any case, we are
conscious that some small inaccuracies
could exist because of the lack of registers
at the parochial Jevel, errors in transcription of the data from parish to diocese files
and from these to Vatican files, or other
such errors (Moroni, 1960; Lazo et al.,
1973), but we think that these are not serious enough to invalidate our results and
conclusions,

 
 

Vol. 26, No. 1

The marriages were classified as follows: uncle-niece and aunt-nephew (coded
in our work as Type 12); first cousins
(Type 22); first cousins once removed
(Type 23); second cousins (Type 33); second cousins once removed (Type 34); third
cousins (Type 44); those with multiple
consanguinity and others. Types 34 and 44
are recorded only for the years 1911 to
1918. For this reason, in the calculation of
the coefficient of consanguinity for each

wprovince these two types and the last two
Sare considered together and called “othSers,” while in the analysis of variation in
Etime they are not considered. The recordSing, processing, and transformation of
Athese data have been described in a previSous publication (Pinto-Cisternas and Mocaroni, 1967).

“ The demographic data for each year
Sand for each of the fifty provinces of Spain
‘(administrative division) were obtained di-arectly from the Instituto Nacional de Es=tadistica de Espana, in Madrid, and con«sisted of the following information: surface
pin km?, total number of inhabitants, civil

‘smarriages, births, and deaths. Other deo

>mographic data were obtained, but not for

Sall years: total number of infant deaths for

‘>the years 1932 and 1940, total number of

“illiterates for the years 1910 and 1920, and

Stotal number of inhabitants living in one

province but born in another for the years

31920 and 1940.

Q Besides the inaccuracies already considered, this kind of information also contains inaccuracies of a different type, and
some of them, i.e., the crude rates, must
be considered as rough indicators of what
they are intended to measure. In any case,
we can say that this demographic information is, even with its defects, the most
reliable and accurate data for this period.
These errors also are not serious enough to
invalidate the tendencies and relationships
we have found (Henry, 1966; Jamison and

Consanguinity in Spain

 

a7

Akers, 1968; Rosenwaike, 1972; Ekanen,
1972; Khan, 1975; Livi-Bacci, 1968).

Since there is not an exact correspondence between dioceses and provinces, we
corrected the data of the dioceses to those
of the provinces so we could relate civil
and ecclesiastic data. We assigned to each
province that percentage of each diocese
that belonged to it with respect to the area
in square kilometers. Table 1 gives the
relation between provinces and dioceses.
There are 49 provinces because the two
provinces that form the Canary Islands
were considered as one. The number in
brackets is the percentage of the diocese
belonging to that province. This percentage served to apportion the consanguineous marriages to the various provinces.
We are aware that this division is not uniform because the places where the marriages were performed are not uniformly
distributed in the dioceses, and the percentages are in some cases very approximate. We think it 1s unlikely that this way
of rearranging the data would cause any
significant error in our final calculations
and results.

After this was done, the data were
punched on IBM cards. With these cards
and utilizing the 360/44 computer of the
University of Pavia, the following calculations were made for each province for the
whole period and for each year: density
(inhabitants/km?), birth rate (per 1,000 inhabitants), death rate (per 1,000 inhabitants), marriage rate (per 1,000 inhabitants), frequency of consanguineous marriages over total civil marriages (number
of marriages of Types 12—22—23-—33 and
others per 1,000 civil marriages), frequency of different types of consanguineous marriages (per 1,000 consanguineous
marriages) and the average coefficient of
consanguinity (a). The same data were
also calculated for each province and for
the whole country, grouping them in seven

the total data of each province, we calculated the same indices for the “macro” regions. All these data were transformed to a

seven subperiods.

The four “macro” geographical regions
were formed by grouping some adjacent
geographical classical regions with similar

characteristics. Figure 1 shows their composition and geographical location.

Thus, we have a North Atlantic macro
region A (Asturias, Galica, Vascongadas), a Central Plateau region B (Castila la Nueva, Castilla la Vieja, Extremadura, Leon), an Eastern Mediterranean region C (Aragon, Cataluna, Murcia, Valencia), and a Southern Mediterranean region D (Andalucia). This subdivision is very similar to the one made for the
analysis of the internal migration in Spain
(Duocastella, 1957), and for a demographic study made by Livi-Bacci (1968).

With the calculated indices of each region, we performed multiple regression on
the variables mentioned above, considering, successively, the coefficient of consanguinity, the frequency of first cousin
marriages, and the frequency of second
cousin marriages as dependent variables.

We must remark here that for all dioceses the data for consanguineous marriages for the year 1924 are missing. For
this reason, the calculations that involved
these data for the subperiod 1920~—24 were
made only for four years. Furthermore,
we must note that during the years of the
Civil War (1936-39), in some dioceses, the
dispensation data for consanguineous
marriages were lost. This loss is particularly marked for the years 1937 and 1938
and in the regions of Cataluna Valencia,
the south of Andalucia, and some parts of
Castilla. All our calculations were corrected for the number of years for which
data were available.

RESULTS

The distribution of the different types of
consanguineous marriages for each diocese
and for each year were the basic data for
all analyses carried out. The size of this
material impedes its publication here.!

Consanguinity in Spain

In order to examine the variations in
space of the variables considered, Table 2
shows the values for the complete period
and for each province. These data, which
can be considered as the mean values for
the 33 years, are suitable for a general
analysis for all the provinces. A glance at
the table shows: (a) There is a great heterogeneity for all variables, although some
(e.g., the marriage rate) fluctuate around
the common values found in other regions
of Western Europe (Livi-Bacci, 1968;
Prioux-Marchal, 1974; INED, 1977;
Federici, 1965). It is possible that some
provinces of Spain resemble southern Italy
or Greece more than they do Belgium or
Sweden (Hajnal, 1965); (6) There is a high
mean value of the coefficient of consanguinity (a). Half the provinces have a
coefficient of consanguinity greater than
0.002, and one-fifth have values greater
than 0.003. Considering that this index
shows a constant decline during the last 15
years examined, these values for a period
of 33 years are extremely high. (c) Among
the different types of consanguineous mar- °
riages, the highest frequency corresponds
to marriages of second cousins (Type 33)
and the lowest to the marriages of uncle
(aunt) and niece (nephew) (Type 12). Out
of the 47 provinces which remain after
removing the Balearic and Canary Islands
which are analyzed in a separate paper
(Pinto-Cisternas et al., 1976), consanguineous marriages of Type 33 are the
most common in 39 provinces. (d) There is
not a clear relationship between the marriage rate and the total frequency of consanguineous marriages. A high (or low)
value of the former does not correspond to
a high (or low) value of the latter. Conjecturally, the factors that influence marriages in genera] and consanguineous marriages in particular are different or act in
different ways. (e) There is an inverse rela-~
tionship between the density and the
coefficient of consanguinity. The correla

tion coefficients for the 47 provinces for
the complete period, calculated separately
between density and consanguineous marriages of Type 22 and between density and
consanguineous marriages of Type 33,
give the following results r = —0 4148
and r = —0 6689, significant respectively
at the 0 01 and 0 001 level

All these facts are in concordance with
other findings about consanguinity demonstrated in other countries, namely, high
values of win regions of low density, farming regions, and those with low socioeconomic development, and, low values of a
in zones of high density, urban conditions,
and high socioeconomic development
(Moroni, 1969, Freire-Maia and FreireMaia, 1961; Freire-Maia, 1968, 1969,
Twiesselmann et al., 1962; Sutter and
Tabah, 1948, Neel et al., 1949, Lazoetal ,
1970, Valls, 1969).

Our data also show a higher frequency
of marriages of Type 22 than of Type 33 in
provinces with high urbanization levels;
five provinces (Alava, Barcelona, Cadiz,
Madrid, Vizcaya) out of the eight where
this type of marriage is the most frequent
have 30 per cent urban population Nevertheless, we do not have more detailed information about the consanguineous marriages (frequently by parish, geographical
origin of the mates, etc) to affirm this
relationship On the other hand, some
data from other urban centers, Milan,
Italy, and Valparaiso, Chile, (Moroni,
1974, unpublished data; Lazo, 1974, unpublished data) show that within a city it
is possible to find true “isolates” formed by
immigrants from different regions to the
city.

This situation could be compared to the
subdivision of a population into a large
number of small communities, geographically separated from each other. Data of
1910 (Enciclopedia Espasa Calpe, 1923)
show that five provinces (Alava, Almeria,
Guipuzcoa, Santander, Vizcaya) of the

In order to examine the trend in time of
= the different variables, Table 3 gives the
«_ same information as Table 2, but for the
>,whole country for the seven subpeniods

Z This table shows (a) for the demographic
$ variables, a decrease of birth and death

— the consanguinity variables, an increase in
3 the frequency of all types of consanguine2 ous marriages in the first part of the period
= considered, followed by a rapid decrease

Q The explanation of the increase in time of
the frequency of consanguineous marriages could be due to the economic crisis
during which the marriages performed
were preferentially between relatives, to
preserve the family’s patrimony and to
permit the familial structure to persist.
This phenomenon has already been demonstrated in other countries (Moroni,
1964, Lazo et al , 1970) The decline in the
subperiod 1935~39 was probably due to
the Civil War, which resulted in a drastic
modification of the normal way of life and,

Michig

perhaps, the loss of many files in some
dioceses For this last reason, in the total
analysis, the values obtained are underestimates

A comparison of our data with data of
other countries can be made only in general terms because the differences in
methodologies, the numbers of years considered, and the areas examined by the
different authors do not allow more
specific comparisons (Freire-Maia, 1961).
Perhaps, the most adequate comparison is
with other European countries of similar
structure and with similar conditions For
example, the frequency of consanguineous
marriages in Belgium (Twisselmann et al.,
1962) fluctuate from 1.98 per cent in
1920-24 to 1.31 per cent in 1940~—41; in
France (Sutter and Tabah, 1948), from 2.65
per cent in 1926-30 to 1 43 per cent in
1941-45; and in Italy (Moroni, 1964),
from 4.72 per cent in 1911-15 to 2.59 per
cent in 1941-45. Compared to these values, Spain shows frequencies from 5.80 per
cent in 1911-14 to 4.12 per cent in 194043 It is clear that Spain has a high frequency of consanguineous marriages and
has maintained these values for a long period The differences are probably due to
the dissimilar development of the socioeconomic conditions, and especially because of the particular characteristics of
each country. Belgium, France, and Italy,
in this order, had a different and faster
development than Spain in the first fifty

years of this century. This fact could be
demonstrated through an analysis of the
evolution of the principal demographic
characteristics of each country, namely,
increment of population, crude birth, mortality, nuptiality, and illiterary rates, etc.
(Presset, 1974; Maison and Millet, 1974;
Blayo, 1974; Monnier, 1974; Calot et al.,
1969).

Finally, to study the relationship between consanguinity and the demographic
variables in time (measured in periods of
five years), the intensity of the relationship
and the weight of each variable in determining the frequencies of consanguineous
marriages, we used multiple regression
analysis and obtained partial correlation
coefficients. Table 4 shows the results obtained for first cousins, second cousins,
and alpha as consanguinity variables. It is
evident that density and birth rate are the
variables more associated with consanguinity. For density, the intensity of the
relationship is greater for second cousins
than for first cousins, confirming the results obtained in zero order correlations
for the entire period. Density is also the
most important variable in determining
the frequencies of consanguineous marriages, contributing 52.40 per cent and
86.32 per cent to the regression sum of
squares for first and second cousins, respectively. However, the coefficient of de
Social Biology

termination, R*, that is, the fraction of
variation attributable to regression of demographic variables, is small for all three
analyses, and the major part of the variation in consanguinity variables remains
unexplained. It may be due to other factors not considered here or, probably, to
the great heterogeneity of the data.

In order to reduce this heterogeneity, we
carried out the analyses after grouping the
provinces into four “macro” regions. Figure 2 indicates the frequencies of the four
demographic variables in each “macro”
region in the seven subperiods. There are
clear differences between the regions. As
regards density, there is one region (A)
with a high density, two regions (C and D)
with intermediate densities, and one region (B) with a low density. But the density, being only a spatial distribution of the
population, is not the only indicator of the
development of a geographical region.
Perhaps one of the best indicators could be
the relative mean increment (RMI) of the
population over the whole period analyzed
(Federici, 1965). So, from 1911 to 1943 the
RMI of the four “macro” regions were the
following: region A, 27.42 per cent; region
B, 30.56 per cent; region C, 30.59 per
cent; and region D, 40.14 per cent. These
data show clearly that “macro” region D
had the greatest increment of population
during the 33 years considered and that

macro” region A had the smallest increment. The “macro” regions B and C have
intermediate values, close to the main increment of the whole country, that is,
31.87 per cent.

As regards the birth and death rates, the
trend for each variable is very similar for
each region, but there is a different ranking with respect to each rate. However, on
the whole, regions B and D have high
birth rates and regions A and C low values. The same trend and association of regions are shown for the death rate. The
high values of the death rate for the second
and sixth subperiods are due to the
influenza epidemic of 1918 and to the Civil
War of 1936-39, respectively. In any
case, both rates have a “normal” trend,
i.e., a continuous decrease in time. Finally, the marriage rate has the most irregular trend, but region A presents the
Jowest values for the entire period. The
values of the last two subperiods are
influenced by the Civil War. Owing to its

irregular trend, the marriage rate is the
least clear of the demographic variables in
its relationship to the socioeconomic development of these zones.

Thus, with respect to the demographic
variables, these regions present the following behavior: region A—high density, but
low increment of the population, low natality, mortality, and nuptiality; region
B—low density but intermediate increment of the population, high natality,
mortality, and nuptiality; region C—
intermediate density and increment of
population, Jow natality and mortality,
and high nuptiality; and region D—
intermediate density, high increment
of population, high natality, mortality,
and nuptiality. On the basis of this information, and considering the relationship
between the socioeconomic development
of a geographical zone and its demographic characteristics, the four macro
regions could be tentatively grouped into
“highly” and “less” developed zones, at

Fic. 3 —Trend in time of consanguinity variables for the macro regions

tributing regions C and D to the first group
and regions A and B to the second. A more
detailed ordering would be difficult, and it
is beyond the main aim of this paper.
Examining now the trend of the consanguinity variables, we observe an almost similar ordering of the regions for
each type (Figure 3). Regions A and B
always present the highest values of the
frequencies and, in particular, region A
for uncle-niece (aunt-nephew) and first
cousin marriages and region B for first
cousin once removed and second cousin
marriages. Region C always presents the
lowest values and D presents intermediate
values. In general, the trend for each type
of consanguineous marriage is not dissimilar in each macro region to that of the
country as a whole: an increase in the first
three subperiods, followed by a constant
decrease in the last four. The observed
decline in frequencies during the Civil
War period is probably due to loss of the
parochial files in some provinces.

Given the similar behavior of the four
regions for the frequencies of the individual types of consanguineous marriages,
the values of @ are also in the same order,
namely A (highest), B, D, and C (Figure
4). Therefore, the negative correlation between socioeconomic conditions and the
value of a found by other authors
(Freire-Maia, 1958; Defrise-Gussenhover
et al., 1963) has been confirmed, in the
general sense, in these data. Region A has
higher values of a than B, owing to the
high frequencies of uncle-niece (auntnephew) marriages (Type 12) and of first
cousin marriages (Type 22). An explanation of this phenomenon can be looked for
in some special characteristics of region A.
Firstly, a large number of people live in
small communities of Jess than one hundred houses, which means a greater probability of consanguineous marriages between near relatives as a product of geographical propinquity. In the eight provinces that belong to region A, more than

35 per cent of the population lived, in
1910, in small communities of less than
one hundred houses, because of the high
amount of subdivision of agricultural
land. Secondly, there was a special migration pattern of young males to foreign
countries for a period of 10 to 15 years
(Tapinos, 1966). It is possible, then, thata
man might emigrate at twenty years of
age, return at thirty or thirty-five years,
and not find a mate among relatives of his
same age but find one among his sisters’ or
brothers’ daughters. In any case, these two
explanations have only hypothetical value
because we do not have more detailed data
regarding marriage types 12 and 22
(pedigree of each subtype, age of spouses,
etc.) to enable us to confirm or reject our
assumptions. But considering that this
phenomenon—high frequency of marriages of Type 22 and especially of Type
12—-occurs only in the provinces of northern Spain, we believe that our comments
are justified. There must exist a sociocultural pattern (social traditions, special features in the transmission of property, etc.),
and a socioeconomic condition (socioeco
nomic structure, division of the agricultural land, etc.) which influence their
marriage patterns so as to create such a
situation (Livi-Bacci, 1968).

Though the behavior of the consanguinity coefficient is the same for the four
regions, some heterogeneity is noted in the
proportions of each type of consanguineous marriage relative to total consanguineous marriages (Table 5). In regions B
and C, first cousin marriages are more
than 50 per cent of all consanguineous
marriages, while in regions A and D the
percentage is lower and nearer to that of
second cousins. Since, it is known that
first cousin marriages contribute to a a
value four times that contributed by second cousin marriages, the coefficient of
consanguinity will depend heavily on the
ratio of first cousin to second cousin marriages. This fact, again, can explain the
precise ordering of the regions with respect
to a: in fact, among the “less developed”
regions, A shows a value of a greater than
B, and among the “higher developed” regions D shows a value greater than C. The
reason for this different relationship be

tween first and second cousins cannot easily be explained by the data available to
us. Perhaps the trend of this ratio in time
could be explained if we knew the progress
in time of the phenomenon that is called
“breakdown of isolates” with the gradual
increase in urbanization and density (Sutter and Soux, 1962; Cavalli-Sforza et al.,
1960; Twiesselmann et al., 1962; FreireMaia, 1969).

For the whole of Spain, one can note the
continuous decrease of first cousin marriages as opposed to the continuous increase of second cousin marriages, which
probably accounts for the signs of the partial correlation coefficients between these

Finally, the analysis of partial correla~

each region shows influences of various
intensities of demographic variables on
consanguinity. In Table 6, the sign and
significance of the partial correlations of
demographic variables with the proportion of first cousin marriages, second
cousin marriages, and a, are shown for
each region. The weight of the variables in
the multiple regression is the percentage of

The demographic variables, then, provide little information and so does the
subdivision into zones, since these do not
show clearly consistent differences from
each other. The demographic variables do
not show any constant significant relationship with consanguinity, with the single
exception of population density. There is
some suggestion of a negative correlation
between consanguinity and socioeconomic
development, but a more detailed analysis
taking into account other factors such as
altitude, isolate size, urbanization and de

gree of industrialization could provide a
clearer answer.

The analysis of the factors correlated
with consanguinity remain, however, a
difficult task, since all the demographic,
social, economic, and cultural characters
that influence the environment in which
the various types of consanguineous marriages occur, vary in time and therefore
can modify the intensity and sometimes
the direction of their effect, becoming significant or negligible with regard to consanguinity.
