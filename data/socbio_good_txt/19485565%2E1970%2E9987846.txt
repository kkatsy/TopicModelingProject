Behavioral Genetics

 

 

Proposed Organization of an Association

of Behavioral Genetics

An informal meeting of persons interested
in a behavioral genetics association was
held in Boston on December 28, at the
time of the annual meetings of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science.
Present were Jack Bresler, Tufts University,
Theodosius Dobzhansky, Rockefeller University, Jerry Hirsh, University of Illinois,
Richard Osborne, University of Connecticut, Sheldon Reed, University of Minnesota,
John Scott, Bowling Green State University, and Jon Streng, University of Texas.

The results of John Leohlin’s fall mailout
from the University of Texas to 152 people
who had recently published in the field of
behavioral genetics was discussed. Of the
82 respondents, only five expressed disinterest in the formation of an association,
and three of these on the basis of the fact
that they considered behavioral genetics to
be peripheral to their primary area of interest. All but 15 of the remaining 77 re
 

63

spondents expressed willingness to assist in
the organization of such an association.

It was decided that a formal organizational meeting should be held, and Jerry
Hirsch offered to host such a meeting at the
University of Illinois, Urbana, on March 30,
Letters of invitation were sent to the 62
repondents to the questionnaire who had
indicated a willingness to work on an organizing committee.

On the nomination section of the questionnaire, 66 names had been proposed for
the organizing committee with 26 of these
receiving from 5 to 20 votes. To assure
attendance of a group as representative of
the field as possible, transportation to the
meeting at the expense of the American
Eugenics Society was offered to those 26
individuals receiving the most votes. A report of the Urbana meeting will appear in
the June issue of Soczal Biology.
