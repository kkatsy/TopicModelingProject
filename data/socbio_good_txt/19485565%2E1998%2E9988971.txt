ABSTRACT: Demographic, social, and economic influences on cause of death are analyzed for
Mexico in 1990. The paper draws on epidemiologic transition theory and empirical studies as a
framework to examine effects of 28 independent variables in four groups—demographic, sociocultural, economic, and housing/health/crime—on standardized mortality by cause. Data at the
state level are mostly from the Mexican census of 1990. Effects are analyzed through spatial
analysis and regression. The principal causes of death reveal distinctive geographical patterns.
The regression findings only partially validate hypothesized effects. Overall, the most important
predictors are crowding, housing characteristics, marriage and divorce, and manufacturing
workforce. By variable group, there are effects for specific causes of death. For instance, hypothesized direct economic prosperity influences are present for one cause category, mixed for two,
and refuted for cancer and heart disease. The findings are discussed and interpreted relative to
the research literature and reveal differences from epidemiologic transition theory, effects that

 

are specific to Mexico, and divergence from some of the patterns in advanced nations.

The present study has the objectives to
describe the contemporary cause of death
patterns in Mexico, to examine the socioeconomic factors that are associated with
particular causes of death, and to interpret
the factors relative to a conceptual framework. The study also compares the relative
importance of major groups of socioeconomic factors on cause of death. The paper
utilizes the techniques of spatial analysis
and multivariate statistics. Although there
have been several studies that examined
causes of death in Mexico (Fernandez,
1983; Rabell and Mier y Teran, 1986;
Camposortega Cruz, 1988, 1989a; Perez
Astorga, 1980, 1988), those studies did not
analyze socioeconomic influences associated with cause-specific mortality. The
present paper intends to explore and determine what are such factors and to compare
their relative intensities and differences.

The paper first discusses general mortality changes, presents a_ conceptual

framework, and examines patterns of
cause-specific mortality. Then the paper
turns to a series of regression models to
analyze groups of socioeconomic factors
associated with cause-specific mortality.
The paper ends with a discussion of the
findings and conclusions.

From 1950 to 1993, Mexican life expectancy lengthened overall by twenty-one
years, a remarkable increase. Male life expectancy in 1993 was sixty-six years and
female life expectancy was seventy-three
years (Population Reference Bureau,
1993). By comparison, U.S. life expectancies at birth were seventy-two years for
males and seventy-nine years for females
in 1990 (National Center for Health Statistics, 1993). The average Mexican standardized mortality rate was 5.0 in 1990,
with relatively little variation by state.

As seen in Table 1, the distribution of
cause of death in Mexico changed in the
1980’s. The leading causes of death in

1990 were cardiovascular, followed by
trauma, nutritional/metabolic/endocrine/immunity (abbreviated as NMED), respiratory, and cancer. These five causes accounted for two-thirds of Mexican deaths
in 1990. There were some major shifts in
cause of death 1979-1990, with increases
in cardiovascular, nutritional, and cancer,
and decreases in respiratory and infectious/ parasitic diseases. This shift reflects
social changes that took place in the
1980’s. In particular, declines in respiratory and infectious/parasitic categories reflect improved environmental conditions
regarding sanitation, pollution, and public
health. On the other hand, the increase in
cardiovascular mortality may stem from
dietary and lifestyle changes, while the
relative increase in cancer deaths may be
due to environmental and dietary alterations. The decrease in undefined diseases
is linked to improved statistical accuracy
in designation of cause of death.

Overall, trends in cause of death reflect the benefits from greater emphasis
on sanitation and public health, but deterioration stemming from dietary, stress,

and pollution factors. Despite an increase
in population size, the total number of
deaths decreased slightly between 1979
and 1990, which reflects a substantial
lowering in the crude mortality rate, as
well as age structural shifts in the 1980’s.
In the present study, variables were examined spatially through use of a geographic information system (ESRI, 1996).
The spatial analysis was useful in determining the geographical patterns of cause of
death in 1990 and changes in patterns since
1980. For instance, spatial patterns for cardiovascular and cancer are highly similar,
but differ from the other causes. Cardiovascular and cancer rates show higher levels in
the more economically advanced parts of
Mexico, including the border states and
Mexico City, and lower levels in the poorer
and less developed areas such as the Bajio
and south. The results of this analysis are
useful in informing the regression analysis
later in this paper. Similar spatial study was
done for all the independent variables. Several of the spatial findings are included in
the results section and others are described
elsewhere (Pick and Butler, 1994).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This study examines socioeconomic
influences on cause of death through descriptive and multivariate statistical techniques. The analysis is done at the state
level, i.e., the sample is the thirty-two
Mexican federal entities, which include
thirty-one states plus the Federal District.
The study seeks to determine demographic, social, and economic influences
on death rates by cause of death. The
level of analysis is macro, 1.e., at the state
level, rather than micro, i.e., at the individual level. Any effects and social patterns discovered represent socio-economic effects of aggregated attributes of
the states as a whole on the aggregated
mortality for entire states. The emphasis
on state-level effects in the present study
has the weakness of not reflecting individual effects. On the other hand, the
macro effects are useful in understanding
broad macro trends and associations for
causes of death. Many studies in Mexico
and elsewhere have examined trends in
cause of death for aggregates of states or
larger entities, for instance at the national
level (for example, see Preston, 1975; Rabell and Mier y Teran, 1986; Perez, 1988;
Jiménez, 1995) and have provided important macro-level findings and conclusions. In the present analysis of Mexico
as a whole, an individual-level nationwide analysis was not possible due to
lack of national data sets containing mortality as well as a substantial socioeconomic attributes.

The mortality data are compiled from
the state death registration system by the
federal government and appear in the Anuario Estadistico (INEGI, 1991). Although
the Mexican vital registration system has
been criticized (for instance, Bruch et al.,

Causes of Death

 

153

1980; Garcia y Garma, 1988), it improved
in the latter part of the 80’s and in the 90’s
due to more comprehensive and more accurate registration (INEGI, personal communication, 1997). Although not as accurate as vital registration systems in the
United States and Western European nations, the contemporary Mexican data are
considered by the present investigators to
be accurate enough for the purposes of this
analysis that focuses on associations with
socioeconomic factors.

To accomplish the present study, we
adjusted the mortality rates through a
process of standardization, which was
necessary in order to adjust for differences in the age structure between states.
The method used is indirect standardization (Keyfitz and Flieger, 1971). The standard population selected is the nation of
Mexico, 1990. The method adjusts the
cause-specific death rate of the given population by a factor that is the ratio of the
number of cause-specific deaths in the
given population divided by the number
of cause-specific deaths based on the mortality rates of the standard population and
the age structure of the given population.
More specifically, the standardized causespecific mortality rate for each state is adjusted by a factor d/Summation (M_P,),
where d represents the total cause-specific
deaths in the state, M, is the age-causespecific death rate for the nation and P_, is
the population of a five-year age group for
the state. It is important to mention that,
since the age distribution of the population has small variation between states, indirect standardization in this instance has
only a modest effect on values.

The statistical models are designed to
assess the associations between selected
independent variables and mortality dependent variables. The associations are

studied through simple correlations and
regressions, based on a standard statistical package (SPSS Inc., 1995). All correlations are Pearson type.

The regression analysis is organized
into two submodels. In both submodels,
standardized mortality rate for the five
major causes of death constitutes the dependent variable. In the first submodel,
all twenty-eight socioeconomic variables
are eligible as independent variables,
based on a stepwise regression algorithm,
with the number of steps fixed at four.
This submodel is intended to test which
are the most significant individual factors
associated with cause-specific mortality.
The submodel seeks to validate the postulated influences of the independent variable on each cause of death.

A second submodel examines the influence of each group of independent socioeconomic factors on each cause of
death. In this instance, a somewhat different regression technique is applied. For
each group of factors—for instance, demographic—the cross-correlations of the
independent variables are examined to reduce collinearity. The variables in each
group are reduced down to the four that
eliminate the largest amount of cross-correlation between independent variables.
Then the resulting four variables are
forced into the regression equation. This
submodel has the goal to ascertain (1)
whether each variable group has an overall significant effect on each cause of
death, and (2) to analyze which independent variables are most influential for
each of twenty regressions, that is, one
regression for each combination of independent variable group and _ cause-ofdeath dependent variable. It is expected
that the most significant independent
variables will show general correspon

dence between the two submodels. Taken
together, the two submodels will enable
determination of both the most important
independent variable effects, as well as
the groups of independent variables that
are most important and what variables
within groups are the most significant.
Although other methodologies could
be employed including factor analysis,
this choice of methodology has the advantage of appropriateness to small sample sizes (V=32) and to preserving the
group Classification stemming from conceptual theory and empirical literature.
Also, the methodology is appropriate to
the sample’s entirely numeric variables.

POSTULATED MORTALITY INFLUENCES

The overall framework of this study is
that mortality is influenced by a variety
of demographic, social, economic, and
health attributes. The conceptual approach
draws on epidemiological transition theory
(Omran, 1977, 1982) and also is based on
empirical bodies of evidence regarding social and economic influences on mortality
(Kitagawa and Hauser, 1975; Guzman,
1989; Camposortega, 1989a, 19895; Preston and Taubman, 1994). Epidemiologic
transition theory is regarded as a part of
demographic transition theory (Rockett,
1994; Kirk, 1996). It postulates that there
are four stages in the drop in mortality:
(1) famine and pestilence, (2) lowering
pandemics, and (3) degenerative and manmade diseases (Omran, 1977), as well as a
fourth stage more recently added, (4) hybristic, or mortality affected strongly by
behavior and life-style (Rogers and Hackenberg, 1987). The progression of mortality lowering through these stages can last
for centuries as occurred in Europe or occur over decades as in developing nations
in the twentieth century (Omran, 1977).

Movement from Stages (1) through (3)
has been influenced in rough time order
by rising standards of living, improved
nutrition and alterations in diseases, medical progress, and public health programs,
while more recent movement to Stage (4)
has been influenced by behaviors and
lifestyles of people (Omran, 1977;
Rogers and Hackenberg, 1987).

The theory of epidemiologic transition
is meaningful to Mexico in the mid to
late twentieth century and to this study.
Major Mexican progress on control of infectious diseases occurred in the 1940's
and 1950’s, while chronic diseases have
become progressively more important in
the second half of the century (Camposortega, 1987a). Mexico has begun to
move somewhat into Stage 4, since
lifestyle influences such as violence,
drugs, and diet have become more important in recent decades. Epidemiologic
transition theory is appropriate for Mexico due to the extreme spatial differences
in both the levels of mortality and the
factors affecting mortality (Rabell and
Mier y Teran, 1986; Pick and Butler,
1990, 1994; Jiménez, 1995). In other
words, different regions of Mexico are in
different stages of relatively rapid epidemiologic transition, so all the theoretic
factors postulated may be important today. Mostly following epidemiologic
transition theory, the present paper classifies independent variables into four
groups. The housing, health, and crime
group reflects the influences of public
health, sanitation, and the social environment; the sociocultural group reflects social status and the macro level aspects of
lifestyle; and the economic prosperity
group contains aggregated economic attributes that reflect rising standards of living. Data were not available at the state

Causes of Death 155

level in Mexico on changes in the nature
of diseases and behavioral elements, so
those aspects of transition theory are excluded. Specific hypotheses for attributes
are covered later in this section.

In addition to the justification of these
groups from epidemiological transition
theory, there have been studies predominantly in advanced nations of the importance of socioeconomic factors in mortality. A large U.S. study based on individual
records (Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973)
showed substantial effects for income,
occupation, education, and race. A recent
literature review of studies of determinants of older mortality, mostly in the
United States, confirmed the importance
of social and economic factors (Preston
and Taubman, 1994). There are numerous
empirical studies for advanced nations
that have confirmed consistently that
higher social and economic status 1s correlated with lower mortality rates, both
for total mortality and for a variety of
causes of death (for instance, Bassett and
Krieger, 1986; Feldman et al., 1989; Page
and Kunz, 1980; and Williams, 1990). In
Mexico, there have been relatively few
studies of socioeconomic determinants of
mortality at the national level. Partly this
has related to problems historically in the
vital registration system (Garcia y
Garma, 1988). Among the existing studies are those of Camposortega (1989b)
noting urban-rural mortality differences
and of Mojarro and Nuiiez (1975) describing impacts of education and housing for infant mortality.

In addition to the three variable groups
stemming from epidemiologic transition
theory, a fourth demographic group was
added. The most obvious demographic
variable influencing mortality, namely
age, is already controlled for by utilizing

standardized mortality rates. In Mexico,
the lowering effect on mortality of urban
versus rural location has been confirmed
as an important demographic influence
(CEED, 1970; Mojarro and Nufiez, 1975;
Garcia y Garma, 1983; Camposortega,
1989b). Another important demographic
influence on mortality is nuptiality, as
seen for the United States (Gove, 1973;
Kisker and Goldman, 1987; Hu and Goldman, 1990; Zick and Smith, 1991; Lillard
and Panis, 1996) and Bangladesh (Rahman, 1993). Although the researchers
could not locate similar Mexican studies,
nuptiality is postulated to be a mortality
influence especially since the family is regarded as strong in Mexico.

Based on this conceptual background,
the independent variables are categorized
into four groups: demographic, socio-cultural status (SCS), housing/health/crime
(abbreviated henceforth as HHC), and
economic prosperity. The groups have the
advantage not only of identifying the significant associated independent factors
but also of comparing the relative explanatory power of the groups with each
other.

This section discusses in more detail
the choice of specific independent variables, which are listed in Table 2. For the
demographic group, the urban indicators
are urbanization, defined in Mexico as the
ratio of persons living in places of 2,500
or more to all persons (INEGI, 1992), and
urbanization change 1950-90. The nuptiality attributes included are marriage
and divorce. It is expected that states with
higher marriage rates and lower divorce
rates will have reduced mortality due to
enhanced familial caring for the health of
spouses and other family members. On
the other hand, studies have indicated that
divorced persons have increased mortal
Social Biology

ity compared to married (Zick and Smith,
1991).

The SCS characteristics included are
well known ones of literacy, secondary
education, professional/technical/managerial occupations, agricultural occupation,
indigenous language, religion, and race.
In Mexico, the predominant racial distinction is between the mestizo and indigenous, 1.e., Indian population segments. There is not a sharp demarcation
between these two groups, since the mestizo population was formed historically
from a mixture of Indian and Spanish
populations. For this paper, indigenous is
measured by the per cent of population
who speak an indigenous language. Indigenous language knowledge is independent of knowledge of Spanish, i.e., some
indigenous language speakers may know
Spanish and others may not. In conformance with SCS results on racial differences in the United States and elsewhere,
it is expected that the lower the racial status, i.e., the higher the proportion of indigenous population, the higher the mortality (Pick, 1977; Preston and Haines,
1991; Manton et al., 1987; Otten et al.,
1990; Behrman et al., 1991). In the context of racial differences in the United
States, studies have indicated that blackwhite mortality differences are largely
due to socioeconomic differences (Keil et
al., 1992; Mutchler and Burr, 1991), and
the same may be true in Mexico, although studies have not been done.

The last SCS variable is non-Catholic
religion. In Mexico, several studies point
to the dominant Catholic majority population tending to have higher social and economic status. For example, in a study of
socioeconomic effects on fertility, the proportion non-Catholic increased the fertility
(Pick et al., 1989), a direction of effect on

United States. Among other things, it will
test whether religious effects noted for fertility that were interpreted as SCS in nature also apply to mortality.

The third group of variables includes
housing, health, and crime variables. In
terms of epidemiologic transition theory,
they reflect improved physical environment and public health. Housing variables
have been little studied in relation to mortality. In mortality studies in developing
nations they have only occasionally been
included. Housing variables would seem
to have direct linkages to theoretical intermediates for infectious disease, including
sanitation, spread of infections, and cleanliness. On the other hand, for chronic diseases including cancer and heart disease,
where modern epidemiological studies
show a large influence of diet (Henderson
et al., 1991; Black, 1992), poorer housing
may be associated with improved diets,
i.e., more vegetable-based, leading to re
duced mortality. The postulated effects are
that improved housing will be related to
lower mortality for all categories.
Influences of quality of health services,
care, and facilities on improved mortality
are cited in the third stage of epidemiologic transition theory (Omran, 1982). In
certain instances they have been documented in U.S. mortality studies (for instance, On cancer; see Page and Kunz,
1980). However, the results are mixed and
vary by cause of death. The present study
hypothesizes that better health conditions,
as reflected by hospitals per capita, will
improve mortality for all major causes of
death. A different type of health variable is
absence of meat and eggs from diets. This
census variable was available in the 1980
Mexican census but dropped in the 1990
census (SPP, 1982-84; INEGI, 1992). In
concert with a growing body of literature
on dietary causation of heart disease and
cancer, this variable is hypothesized to
increase the mortality effects of chronic

158

diseases, i.e., cardiovascular and cancer,
but to be neutral for the other causes of
death. From the standpoint of transition
theory, this variable relates particularly to
the fourth (hybristic) stages.

Crime is mostly associated with the
fourth transition stage, since it is behaviorally controlled. The crime variable of
penal sentences per capita is expected to
influence trauma mortality but not to affect the other causes of death.

The last group of attributes is economic prosperity. It is important in epidemiologic transition theory in providing
for rising living standards and has also
been widely confirmed as generally beneficial in advanced nations through empirical studies (Preston and Taubman, 1994).

There are eleven indicators of the level
of economic prosperity for a state, including economic activity, unemployment,
underemployment, public investment by
the federal government in the state, value
of corporations, new mortgage value, the
proportion of workforce for three categories, prevalence of telephones, and motor vehicle ownership. With the exception
of workforce characteristics, these variables are expected to lower the level of
mortality. Such a relationship is supported by economic models that have
been constructed and tested based on the
consumption of items that maximize a
utility function for improved health.
These models postulate that consumers
can consume items that will improve
health status (see for example, Rosenzweig and Schultz, 1983) and that greater
economic resources will improve health
or mortality levels. They have, however,
had limited empirical testing.

Three aggregate workforce variables
are included. The personal services and
commercial workforces are postulated to

Pick and Butler

Social Biology

decrease mortality rates for all cause of
death categories, since services reflects a
more advanced economy. However, the
manufacturing workforce is postulated to
increase cancer and respiratory mortality,
through the counteracting detrimental environmental and pollution effects. The effects of an elevated manufacturing sector
may be expected to be exacerbated in
Mexico compared to the United States,
because there are weaker environmental
controls in Mexico (Sanchez, 1990; U.S.
President, 1993). Manufacturing workforce is not hypothesized to influence the
other causes of death.

The hypotheses on the broad impacts of
variables from the four categories of independent variables are briefly summarized
in Table 2. The variables are drawn from
two data sources, the 1990 Mexican Census of Population (INEGI, 1992) and the
Anuario Estadistico in 1991 and 1992 (INEGI, 1991-1992). The data are entirely for
1990, except for two 1980 characteristics,
in the Housing/Health/Crime Group. They
are Hospitals Per Capita, and No Meat and
Eggs, i.e., the per cent of census respondents having no meat and eggs in their
diet. No meat and eggs was dropped for
the 1990 Mexican census (INEGI, 1992),
and the hospital data by state were not
available for 1990; these variables were
considered important enough to the study
to utilize the data for 1980. For these attributes, we assume that the geographical
distributions did not change very much in
the decade of the 1980’s.

RESULTS

Since age structure does not vary
much between Mexican states (Pick and
Butler, 1994), the age-standardized annual mortality rate is significantly corre

lated (r=0.78) with the crude annual
mortality rate. The standardized mortality
rate, in turn, is strongly positively correlated with the NMEI and respiratory mortality rates, and also with cardiovascular
mortality. However, it is not correlated
with trauma or cancer mortality. It 1s not
surprising that these three causes of death
are also significantly intercorrelated.
Cancer mortality, shown in Figure 1, is
very strongly linked to cardiovascular
mortality (r=0.86). In fact, this correlation is the highest among all the mortality
cross-correlations. The reason for this
very strong association is that both
causes-of-death have high values throughout the border region, as well as the Federal District and Jalisco. However, for
both attributes, the outlying Mexico City
megalopolitan region, i.e., the states surrounding the Federal District, has moderate to low mortality. For these two causes,
the consistently high values throughout
the border region is remarkable and will
be examined further in the discussion.
Spatially, the respiratory mortality
rate, shown in Figure 2, has higher values
in the Federal District, Mexico, Puebla,
and surrounding states, as well as Jalisco.
This finding reflects the well known air
pollution effects stemming from the major metropolises of Mexico City, Puebla,
and Guadalajara and influencing surrounding areas. Respiratory mortality is
mixed in the border region, and moderate
to low in the south and Yucatan peninsula. In the latter regions, environmental
and pollution factors are more favorable.
This spatial pattern is dramatic and contrasts sharply with cancer mortality (Figure 1) as well as the other cause of death
categories. NMEI is correlated with respiratory and has a similar spatial pattern.
Trauma has a polyglot spatial pattern; for

Causes of Death

 

159

instance trauma is high in several highly
advanced states (Baja, Jalisco, Mexico)
and at the same time very high in the
poor states of Zacatecas, Guerrero, and
Oaxaca. The reason for this polyglot pattern may be the vagaries of such influences as state safety regulations, terrain,
state criminal laws and enforcement, and
the “climate” for mortal crimes and suicide. Overall, trauma is higher in Baja
California, the western mountain states,
south, and southeast.

On the basis of simple correlations,
there are many strong associations between independent attributes and causes of
death. It is important to note that the associations are much stronger for individual
causes of death than for standardized total
mortality. In fact, the only significant simple correlation for standardized total mortality rate is an inverse relationship with
underemployment. On the other hand, all
cause-specific mortality variables have
many significant simple correlations, except for trauma. The enhanced associations point right away to the importance of
disaggregating mortality into its causespecific components. This rich set of relationships would be largely hidden by
studying only total mortality. On the other
hand, for purposes such as population projections, etc., it is often more appropriate
to utilize aggregated mortality.

The lack of simple associations for
trauma mortality is explained by its unusual polyglot geographical distribution.
The strongest respiratory association is
with manufacturing workforce, which is
not surprising since manufacturing is a
source of air pollution, especially given
Mexico’s weak environmental regulatory
enforcement (U.S. President, 1993).

with socioeconomic attributes. For both
dependent variables, there are significant
simple associations to independent attributes in all four variable groups.

REGRESSION RESULTS: SUBMODEL I

The results of the stepwise regressions
reveal significant results that allow identification of the most important influences
on the five causes of death. The regressions for each cause of death are significant overall at the p = 0.01 level. The results will be discussed briefly for each
cause.

1. Cardiovascular—As seen in Table 3,
higher crowding reduces cardiovascular
mortality while higher divorce rates increase it. The crowding result is interpreted
as an indirect effect, stemming from
crowding’s close associations with literacy
(-—0.93) and urbanization (—0.74). Thus
high crowding occurs in more rural and
lower socioeconomic-status parts of the
nation. However, those areas in the south
region tend to have improved diet (more
vegetable-based, lower fat) and lower
psychological stress, factors that lower cardiovascular-disease risks (Black, 1992).
Divorce is associated with increased cardiovascular risk because of the wellsubstantiated reduction in familial caring in
divorced/separated populations versus married populations (Kisker and Goldman,
1987; Hu and Goldman, 1990). This effect
may be amplified in a Catholic nation, for
which the divorce rates are much lower
than in the United States. The associations
noted here refer to those at the state level,
i.e., effects on the entire population of divorced persons rather than on individuals.

2. Trauma.—Trauma associations are
limited to a single attribute, i.e., underemployment, which is related to in
Causes of Death 161

creased trauma. Larger ranks of underemployed population increase personal
stresses including psychological and financial. Increased stress leads in turn to
greater susceptibility to trauma, including
accidents, homicide, and suicide. The
U.S. analogy is the ghetto area, characterized by high underemployment with underemployment leading to higher stress
and in turn trauma.

3. NMEI_—NMEI has strong associations, in particular, positive ones with
manufacturing workforce and vehicle registration and an inverse one with marriage. There is a marginal positive association with housing lacking electricity
(barely insignificant at t = 0.0501). The
first two positive effects reflect more urban environments having greater environmental contamination and pollution. The
connection between a more polluted environment and NMEI diseases is unknown
and worthy of further investigation. The
influence of marriage in lowering NMEI
mortality may be ascribed to the benefits
of married populations having enhanced
familial care-giving (Kisker and Goldman, 1987; Hu and Goldman, 1990; Rahman, 1993).

4. Respiratory.—Respiratory mortality
is linked significantly with manufacturing
workforce, marriage, crowding, and literacy. The strong effect of manufacturing is
due to environmental pollution, 1n particular, air pollution. In spite of Mexico’s
strong environmental regulations, they
are enforced with laxity (Sanchez, 1990;
U.S. President, 1993), and the nation’s
urban areas suffer from bad air pollution,
much of it from industrial sources (Lacy,
1993; Garza and Fernandez, 1995). The
inverse effect of marriage corresponds to
previously discussed benefits of marriage

to have increased spread of air-borne disease in a state with more crowded living
units. The positive effect of literacy is unexplained and calls for further investigation.

5. Cancer—The significant effects for
cancer are crowding (positive), agricultural occupation (negative), housing lacking and toilet facilities (negative). In addition, divorce is marginally significant
(r = 0.054) and in the anticipated positive direction. The interpretation for
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 45, No. 3-4

crowding is similar to its explanation for
cardiovascular, 1n particular that it indirectly is tied in a macro sense to reduced
diet and higher living stresses. The inverse association for housing without toilet is similar to that for crowding. Agricultural occupation’s influence may be
due to exposure to environmental contaminants and pollution, which are more
severe in Mexico than in the United
States due to considerably less environmental enforcement.

Overall, the most prominent variables
that stand out in predicting cause-specific
mortality are crowding, housing characteristics, marriage and divorce, and manufacturing workforce. These attributes are
not predominantly SCS ones but rather
from other groups.

REGRESSION RESULTS: SUBMODEL II

The results of the regressions by
groups of socioeconomic variables indicate considerable differences in effects
within groups for different causes of
death. These regression results are summarized in Table 4, which shows, for
each group, results for the five cause-ofdeath categories. As discussed earlier,
each regression is constrained to include
only selected independent variables for
that group. These results are first summarized by cause of death, before examining
the results for the group hypotheses.

1. Cardiovascular—All four groups
are highly significant; in particular, the
regressions have overall significance at
the p = 0.01 level. The Demographic
Group has a strong positive influence of
divorce, with similar interpretation to the
stepwise results. The SCS Group is dominated by the association with professional/technical/managerial occupation,
which reflects a postulated SCS effect.

Causes of Death

163

The Housing/Health/Crime Group is
dominated by the inverse crowding effect,
which also was most important for the
stepwise regression results and is similarly interpreted. The Economic Group
has the strongest association with value
of new mortgages, followed by public
federal investment. Both these effects reflect economic prosperity, with the interpretation that enhanced prosperity leads
to higher standards of living and more
support for public health, care services,
and facilities.

2. Trauma.—Only the Economic
Group has a significant trauma effect.
Within this group, the only significant association is underemployment. The explanation is the same as noted previously.
The lack of influence of other demographic and social groups points to
trauma not being linked to socio-cultural
factors, but rather associated with other
sets of factors not in this study. For example, government regulation and aggregate
job stress and lifestyle indicators might
be looked into.

3. NMEI—For NME], the Demographic, SCS, and Economic Groups
show significant regression results. For
the Demographic Group, urbanization has
become the most important variable. Urban location may possibly increase these
diseases due to urban stress factors; this
interpretation calls for further epidemiological research. The influence of marriage was apparent in the stepwise regressions and already has been discussed.
Although the SCS regression is significant, none of its individual attributes is.
For the HHC Group, the only significant
individual association is a reverse one
with crowding. This finding is unexplained and calls for further research. The
Economic Group has the already-noted

effect of manufacturing workforce, a direct effect of telephones, and an inverse
effect with corporation value. Corporation value directly reflects the economic
prosperity of a state and supports the benefits to NMEI disease of improved standard of living.

4. Respiratory—For respiratory, only
the Economic Group is significant overall.
Within this group, only manufacturing
workforce is significant as an individual
factor, a result that is explained similarly
to that for the stepwise regression.

The paucity of group results for respiratory is surprising, since the stepwise result was strong, having four significant
associations. This finding implies that for
respiratory, there are combined influences
of attributes across several attribute
groups. In other words, respiratory effects act synergistically between groups
rather than within groups.

5. Cancer—For cancer, all groups reveal significant associations, pointing to
strong and broad socioeconomic linkages. The individual effects within the
Demographic Group are divorce and urbanization. More urbanized areas tend to
have greater environmental degradation,
which is associated with enhanced cancer
risk (Henderson et al., 1991). The SCS
Group has a single significant association, professional/technical/managerial
occupation, which is opposite to the usually cited effect in U.S.-based research
studies that higher SCS leads to reduced
cancer mortality. This finding for Mexico, however, highlights the heightened
cancer mortality in more advanced regions of the nation. An intermediate explanation may relate to increased environmental pollution, and worsened diet,
1.e., diets with higher content of fat and
carcinogens (Henderson et al., 1991). For

Causes of Death

165

the HHC Group, the only individual association is an opposite one with crowding,
an effect already noted for the stepwise
results. The Economic Group has positive
associations with telephones, value of
mortgages, and taxes and duties collected. These influences point to the
detrimental influence of economic prosperity on cancer mortality. Poorer areas’
lowered risk of cancer mortality (see Figure 1) is not surprising given their improved diets and lowered environmental
contamination.

Comparing the four groups on overall
statistical significance of the regressions
(see Table 4), the Economic Group has
the highest overall model fits, explaining
between one-third and sixty per cent of rsquare. The other three groups reveal less
and roughly equal overall model fits, explaining between one-tenth and sixty-five
per cent of r-square. In particular, these
groups are weak and have nonsignificant
model fits in explaining trauma and respiratory causes of death.

DISCUSSION

The research results point to strong
socioeconomic influences on cause-specific mortality in Mexico. The most important cause-specific effects are due to
crowding, housing characteristics, marriage and divorce, and manufacturing
workforce. The prominence of these attributes may be better understood by considering Mexican society. Crowding has
different connotations in Mexico than in
the United States. In Mexico, crowding is
strongly inversely associated with urbanization. The most metropolitan states are
those with the least household crowding,
while very rural areas have increased
household crowding. As a consequence,
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

 

 

crowding becomes an inverse proxy variable for urbanization, and the interpretations of crowding effects become more
understandable and more keyed to the
mortality literature. For instance, crowding’s reduced effects on cardiovascular
and cancer mortality may be re-stated as
urbanization’s increasing effects. This explanation is plausible, since many epidemiological studies link environmental
degradation and diet with both causes of
death. In Mexico, the urbanized states
have amplified environmental degradation, since strong environmental regulations have heretofore been only weakly
enforced. Likewise, the diet in Mexico’s
metropolitan areas is much fattier and
more meat-based, factors linked to both
cancer and cardiovascular disease (Henderson et al., 1991; Black, 1992).

Poor housing characteristics have
greater mortality impact in Mexico than in
the United States. First, because Mexico is
a developing nation and still has substantial infectious diseases, housing attributes
such as lack of running water may be directly linked to the spread of disease,
whereas this is rarely true today in the
United States. Second, housing characteristics are correlated to SCS. Hence, they
may be serving as proxies for SCS, although some directionality of SCS effects
may be different from the mortality literature, largely based on advanced nations.

Marriage and divorce are well-known
factors from the mortality literature that
influence disease and mortality (Gove,
1973; Kisker and Goldman, 1987; Hu
and Goldman, 1990; Rahman 1993). The
underlying reason is that marriage fosters
caring for the health of family members,
while divorce and single status tend to reduce such caring and lower overall
health. The marriage/divorce factors may

 

Pick and Butler

Social Biology

be even greater in Mexico, since marriage
is a stronger social norm in Mexico than
in the United States, and divorce is still
socially proscribed in Mexico. The wellknown family structure effects may be
amplified in Mexico compared to many
advanced nations.

The prominent effect of manufacturing
workforce is helped by lowered environmental enforcement in Mexico. Hence,
the environmental degradation caused by
manufacturing is amplified in Mexico versus the United States. Uncontrolled plant
emissions in Mexico’s largest cities is an
indication of this problem, although some
of the worst cases in Mexico City have recently been ameliorated (Pick and Butler,
1997).

The hypotheses of group effects are
only partially validated by the research
findings. The extent of validation may be
summarized as follows.

I. Demographic.—The hypotheses on
marriage and divorce are validated. The
results on demographic indicators of an
advanced society are partly confirmed
and partly refuted. For instance, there are
neutral effects from urbanization instead
of the positive effects hypothesized. The
reason is that some cause-specific mortality, specifically cardiovascular, respiratory, and cancer, are neutral or reduced in
rural areas, due to particular features of a
developing nation.

II. Socio-cultural Status (SCS).—In
Mexico, higher socio-cultural status generally tends to increase cause-specific
mortality, rather than reduce it as hypothesized. This hypothesis is validated for
the causes of trauma, respiratory, and
cancer. No influences are noted for either
indigenous language or religion. The lack
of effect of indigenous language stands in
sharp contrast to the United States where

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 45, No. 3-4

black-white differences in mortality level
and causation have been strongly documented (Pick, 1977; Manton et al., 1987;
Otten et al., 1990; Behrman et al., 1991;
Preston and Haines, 1991). One explanation for the lessened ethnic differences in
Mexican death causation is that the economic advantages of mestizo, i.e., nonindigenous, status may be offset by less
healthy diet and greater exposure to environmental degradation and stress.

Ill. Housing/Health/Crime (HHC).—
The hypothesis that better housing improves mortality rates for all causes is not
supported. In particular, low crowding is
associated with higher cause-specific
mortality for cancer, cardiovascular, and
NMEI.

IV. Economic Prosperity—The hypotheses have mixed results. The postulated positive effects of economic prosperity are validated for trauma, mixed for
NMEI and respiratory, and refuted for cardiovascular and cancer. This finding points
to economic prosperity being a complex
factor. For some death causes, it serves to
build and enhance health services and facilities; for others, these advantages are
overwhelmed by the detriments of more
environmental degradation, less healthy
diets, and other adverse changes to
lifestyle.

In terms of epidemiological transition
theory, the biggest surprise is the theoretically opposite findings for various indicators of economic prosperity for chronic
illness categories. Instead of rising standards of living lowering cancer and heart
deaths, they contribute to raising them.
For respiratory and NMEI categories,
there are adverse effects from manufacturing workforce. Transition theory
would favor manufacturing as a reflection
of economic productivity, but this may be

Causes of Death

167

overshadowed by the detrimental environmental effects of this sector in Mexico. On the other hand, the trauma category is fully in concert with transition
theory. For the socio-cultural group, the
effects are opposite of those expected
from transition theory for chronic categories, with higher professional occupational status increasing chronic mortality,
although respiratory findings are in the
expected direction. For the housing/
health/crime group, there is lack of confirmation of the theory, in particular, the
hypothesis of beneficial effects from improved housing is refuted for cancer, cardiovascular, and NMEI. The SCS and
HHC results for chronic diseases indicate that these disease categories are more
favorable in states with lower average
social status and poorer quality housing.
Although opposite to transition theory,
these results may be due to the reduced
long-term susceptibility of poorer, less
well-housed populations to these major
chronic diseases due to improved diet,
external environmental conditions, and
lifestyle. The demographic group is not
relevant to this theory, as mentioned
earlier.

Overall, the theory is not supported
from the standpoint of this particular
study in Mexico in 1990. Part of the reason may be that present-day Mexico has
some unique factors that overwhelm ordinary theoretic considerations. In particular, factors associated with cities and urban areas, places with higher social and
economic status, are linked to adverse air
pollution, other environmental impacts,
urban stresses, less favorable diet for
chronic disease categories, and other adverse impacts. The theory may have applied better earlier in the century during
the earlier history of mortality transition,

168

or presently by enlarging the attribute
scope of empirical studies.

Future studies might be enhanced by
adding factors for the hybristic stage, i.e.,
behavioral and life-style attributes not
available in Mexico for this study. For
respiratory death, the particular influence
in Mexico of air pollution as seen through
spatial analysis and evident among other
things from Mexico City’s status as the
world’s most air-polluted major city
(Lacy, 1993; Pick and Butler, 1997) may
call for inclusion of specific air-contamination variables not generic to epidemiologic transition theory as well as other environmental variables. For instance, state
air pollution attributes would be valuable,
but are currently unavailable from the
Mexican government.

CONCLUSIONS

Mexican mortality dropped substantially since the mid-twentieth century. In
the latter half of the century, it has been
overshadowed by fertility and migration
as demographic components of change.
However, as fertility continues to drop
and the Mexican population ages, mortality will become a more important population change factor (Ham, 1995).

The present research has the goal of examining the influences of socioeconomic
factors on standardized cause-specific
mortality. The data are drawn from Mexican government sources, mostly from the
Mexican census of 1990. The study utilized GIS and statistical methods, principally regression analysis, to describe the
geographic patterns of cause-specific mortality and to construct models to test hypotheses regarding the effects of socioeconomic factors. These factors are divided
into four groups—demographic, socio
Pick and Butler

 

Social Biology

cultural status, housing/health/crime, and
economic prosperity.

The major results of the study are the
following:

1. The principal causes of death have
very distinctive geographical patterns,
with cardiovascular, NMEI, and cancer
mortality higher in the more advanced
parts of the nation, in particular, the border region and major metropolitan states.
The patterns for trauma and respiratory
mortality are more complicated and are
not explained by simple urban or SCS
gradients.

2. Hypotheses were established for effects from the major groups of socioeconomic effects, based on epidemiologic
transition theory and mortality literature,
as well as Mexican-specific factors.

3. The hypotheses were tested through
use of correlation and regression analyses, combining stepwise and fixed entry
of variables.

4. Results revealed significant effects
for all causes of death. In a separate set of
regressions for each group of independent
variables, most results were significant,
especially for cardiovascular, NMEI, and
cancer mortality. For trauma and respiratory mortality, only the economic group
regressions were significant.

5. Overall, the most important predictors of cause-specific mortality were
crowding, housing characteristics, marriage and divorce, and manufacturing
workforce. These predictors are not predominantly SCS or economic factors, as
often pointed to in the mortality literature, but rather other types.

6. The hypothesized effects are only
partially validated. In particular, for the
Demographic Group, marriage/divorce
effects were validated, but the other effects are mixed. For the SCS Group, SCS

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

Vol. 45, No. 3-4

factors tend to increase cause-specific
mortality, rather than reduce it as hypothesized. No influences are noted for indigenous language or religion. For the
Housing/Health/Crime Group, the hypothesis of housing’s positive influence
for all five causes was refuted for cancer,
cardiovascular, and NMEI, with no effects present for the other two causes. For
Economic Prosperity, there were mixed
results. The expected direct effects of
economic prosperity were confirmed for
trauma, mixed for NMEI and respiratory,
and refuted for cardiovascular and cancer.
The implication is that economic prosperity must be viewed as a more complicated mortality factor than it seems at
face value.

7. The theoretic framework of epidemiologic transition theory 1s not well
supported for this particular study for
Mexico in 1990. Although the study results indicated high statistical importance
for economic or standard of living influences, the directions of effects are mostly
opposite to those postulated in transition
theory, especially for chronic causes of

Causes of Death

169

death. For the variable group of sociocultural, the directions of effects are
mostly opposite to those postulated in
transition theory, especially for chronic
causes of death. For the variable group of
socio-cultural, the direction of effect for
chronic diseases is opposite to the theory,
although respiratory conforms to it. For
the housing, health, and crime group, the
effects are theoretically opposite for cancer, cardiovascular, and NMEI.

8. Future studies of influences on
causes of death at the state level may
benefit by enhanced state-level data for
hybristic influences and for air pollution,
which is a specific feature of contemporary urban Mexico. The Stage 4 factors
may help to provide greater support for
epidemiologic transition theory.

9. Generally, many preconceptions
about Mexican cause of death influences
