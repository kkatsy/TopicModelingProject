The Pill and the Rising Costs of
Fertility Control

ABSTRACT: Until recently it seemed obvious that oral contraception greatly reduced the costs of
fertility control. Anxiety about effectiveness was removed, and the inconvenience and displeasure
associated with coitus-related contraception was bypassed. These advantages doubtless led to the
sharp rise in pill use during the 1960’s in the United States. The 1970's, however, appear to have
ushered in a different calculus regarding the pill. Not only has the trend in pill use leveled off, but
suspicions have arisen that the net costs to women of practicing this form of birth control are higher
than was previously believed. It now appears that significant costs to health may exist and that
people are increasingly evincing concern about these physiological consequences. In this paper,
the trend in use of oral contraception is examined briefly. Then, a short summary of some of the
health risks apparently involved in use of the pill is presented. Finally, the main body of the paper

provides information on public attitudes toward the pill over the decade 1966-76.

It is by now commonplace to speak of
oral contraception as having greatly reduced the subjective costs to couples of
controlling their fertility (Bumpass, 1973;
Michael and Willis, 1976). In particular,
the “pill” has lessened anxiety about effectiveness and bypassed the inconvenience
and displeasure associated with coitusrelated contraception. Indeed, it was this
revolutionary reduction in the psychosocial costs of fertility control that apparently induced the sharp rise in use of oral
contraceptives throughout the 1960’s.

During the early and mid 1970’s, however, it has become apparent that the
“contraceptive revolution’—at least as
represented by the pill—is losing momentum. Not only has there been a marked
leveling-off in the trend of pill use but
suspicions have arisen as well that the net
costs to women of practicing this form of
birth control are higher than was previously supposed. Actually, the belief that
the pill entailed low marginal costs was
based on the assumption of minimal ad
verse physiological effects and/or couples’
(or women’s) perception of these effects as
being minor (Michael and Willis, 1976).
Now it appears that significant costs to
health may exist and that people are increasingly evincing some concern about
these physiological consequences. In sum,
there is evidence of a rise in both the actual and perceived costs of pill use. These
costs are eroding the clear advantage enjoyed by the pill during the decade of the
1960’s.

In this paper we will first review briefiy
the trend in pill use. Then, a short summary of some of the health risks apparently involved in the use of oral contraceptives is presented. Finally, the main
body of the paper provides information on
public attitudes toward the pill over the
decade 1966-76.

HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED
WITH USE OF THE PILL

The trend in pill use should not be too
surprising, perhaps, in view of mounting
evidence concerning the apparent risks to
health that are associated with oral contraception. Let us briefly consider these
risks.

It is sometimes claimed that the popular
media sensationalize the health risks of
oral contraception (Tietze and Jaffe,
1976). However, if one follows the medical
and epidemiological literature with some
care and consistency, one can easily become far more alarmed than by reading
journalistic accounts. Indeed, the build-up
of findings in the past few years led the
British Medical Journal (Vol. 1, No. 6001)
on January 10, 1976 to editorialize concerning the “grisly collection of contraceptive induced disease . . .” (pp. 58-59).
While this evaluation may be overstated,
there are a number of recent trends that
stand out.

First of all, the range of major diseases
for which the relative risk is higher among
pill users appears to be broadening. From
the early reports of venous thrombosis and
pulmonary embolism, the circle has widened to include myocardial infarction,
hypertension, cerebral thrombosis, possibly all cardiovascular disease except
rheumatic heart disease, gall bladder
complications, and liver tumors (Inman
and Vessey, 1968; Vessey, 1968; Markush
and Siegel, 1969; Siegel and Markush,
1969; Sartwell et al., 1969; Oliver, 1974;
Royal College of General Practitioners,
1974; Collaborative Group for the Study
of Stroke in Young Women, 1973 and
1975; Mann and Inman, 1975; Mann et
al., 1975; Mann et al., 1976; Vessey et al.,
1976; U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, n.d.).

Although the risks of both morbidity
and mortality are typically higher among

Costs of Fertility Control 269

pill users over age 40 than among younger
users, even the latter suffer higher relative
risks than nonusers of oral contraception.
If they smoke and use the pill, young
women are at particularly high relative
risk of mortality from pulmonary embolism and myocardial infarction (Jain,
1977); and pill users tend to exhibit a
greater prevalence of heavy smoking
(Royal College of General Practitioners,
1974; Vessey et al., 1976).

An impression that young women enjoy
relative immunity from health risk due to
oral contraception appears to have resulted from a computation of the so-called
additional mortality among young pill users, compared to their expected mortality
in the event of nonuse of any method of
birth control or resort to abortion only
(Tietze et al., 1976). By these calculations,
the dangers of the pill among youthful age
groups seem slight compared with the high
mortality associated with childbearing (in
the absence of birth control) or abortionrelated mortality (if the latter were the sole
method of birth control used). However,
these pregnancy- and abortion-related
mortality rates assume that average
lifetime pregnancies number 13.4 per
woman (in the absence of birth control)
and that average lifetime abortions total
28.9 per woman (if abortion were the only
method used).! As far as we know, such
average rates of pregnancy and abortion
are unprecedented in large-scale noncontracepting populations and, hence, the associated mortality risks are inflated.
When, in addition, one takes into account
that nonpill methods are available, then
the relative risks of the pill to young
women again move into the focus of concern.

1 T am indebted to Dr. Valerie Beral of the London
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine for calling
my attention to the lifetime pregnancy and abortion
rates assumed in the mortality levels used by Tietze
et al. (1976).

It should be noted as well that our discussion of morbidity and mortality says
nothing of the fairly long-term impairment
to fecundity after discontinuation of oral
contraception (Vessey et al., 1976), the
suppression of the amount of lactation if
oral contraception is resumed or initiated
post-partum (Rosa, 1976), or the mass of
physiological “differences” between pill
users and nonusers (U.S. Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare, n.d.;
Wynn, 1975; Wynn et al., 1975; Beck,
1975; Kalkhoff, 1975; Beral, 1974).

Second, and as a consequence of the
broadening range of diseases for which the
relative risk is higher among pill users, the
cumulative absolute risk over all of these
diseases may be very much higher than
was believed when only selected thromboembolic entities seemed to be involved.
We cannot keep adding major diseases for
which the relative risk is two to eight times
greater among pill users and not begin to
incur some absolute effects as well. This
observation appears to be supported in a
recent paper by Valerie Beral published in
Lancet (Beral, 1976).

Using mortality statistics for 21 countries that have experienced major increases in pill use, Beral (1976) has estimated that the absolute excess mortality,
due to use of the pill, from all nonrheumatic cardiovascular diseases may be as
high as 20 per 100,000 women aged 15-44.
As she says (p. 1051):

This excess is substantial when compared
with the annual mortality rate of 70 per
100,000 from all causes, and of 1 per 100,000
from all causes associated with childbearing
for women of comparable age in England
and Wales in 1971/1972.

If, in fact, it turns out that the increased
risks of mortality are this high, maybe
even higher, then the pill’s record will be
unfavorable compared to the risks of
childbearing. It will no longer be possible

Social Biology

to downplay the absolute risks as being
small, even though the relative ones are
high. It will also no longer seem credible to
say that we are saving normal, healthy
women from the greater physiological
challenge of childbearing or abortion
(Tietze et al., 1976).

PUBLIC VIEWS ABOUT THE
SAFETY OF THE PILL

In order for individuals to experience,
as acost, the potential health risks in using
the pill, such risks must be both perceived
and defined as matters of concern. Have
we any evidence of public anxiety about
the unwanted physiological effects of oral
contraception, and has the level of this
anxiety changed over time?

This information is not available from
such obvious sources as the National Fertility Studies of 1965 and 1970, the national surveys of married women in the
reproductive ages to which reference has
already been made. In so far as these studies have been interested in objections to or
anxieties about birth control methods, the
questions have been directed to respondents who were “quitters” or nonusers.
Consequently, from these surveys we have
no means of charting overall views about
the pill, even among women in the reproductive ages.

However, since 1966 I have commissioned on national surveys of approximately 1,500 voting age adults questions
on public views about oral contraception.
One such question concerned opinions
about the safety of the pill:

Do you think birth control pills can be used
safely—that is, without danger to a person’s
health?

In all, there have been seven such surveys
containing the same question about oral
contraception—the last in August, 1976.

Because pill use is so characteristic of

young people rather than those over age (Figure 2). In December, 1966, the date of
30, let us look first at the views over time our first observation, well over half of
of men and women under the age of 30 young people expressed a belief in the pill’s

safety. The next survey, taken in 1970, a
few weeks after the beginning of the Congressional hearings on oral contraception
chaired by Senator Gaylord Nelson indicates a precipitous drop in confidence, together with a rise in responses claiming
that the pill is not safe and an increase in
“don’t know” answers. Nevertheless, over
time, confidence in the pill’s safety started
back up and by 1974 had reached prehearing levels among the young.

During the past two years or so, however, a major change has occurred, especially among young women. Between 1974
and 1976, women under 30 showed a 66
per cent increase in the proportion saying
“not safe” and a 34 per cent drop in those
saying “safe.” It is worth noting as well
that “don’t know” responses have declined
over time. Opinion has hardened, and it
has done so in the direction of less and less
confidence in pill safety. In effect, among
those where pill use has been most prevalent, confidence has been perceptibly
shaken. More young women in 1976 believed the pill to be unsafe than at the
height of the furor created by the Nelson
hearings in early 1970. With somewhat
lesser amplitude, the same trend is evident
among young men.

Turning to respondents aged 30-44, the
remainder of the reproductive age group,
the trends are very similar (Figure 3), but
the levels of confidence in the pill’s safety
have been lower at every date. It is worth
noting that men in this age group experienced an enormous increase in the “not
safe” response over the time period—-167
per cent. Between 1974 and 1976 alone,
this response category increased 41 per
cent among men and 37 per cent among
women.

Older respondents (aged 45 and over)
evinced similar trends, but at an even
lower level of belief in safety at each date
than for those aged 30-44. By 1976, only
29 per cent of the men and 26 per cent of
the women believed the pill to be safe.

Social Biology

What influences these beliefs in safety?
It is not possible to answer this question
definitively. It is possible, however, to call
attention to factors that do not appear to
influence them. A Multiple Classification
Analysis of the 1976 survey shows that
age, sex, race, religion, education, marital
status, family income, occupation, and
community size combined will only explain 4.3 per cent of the variance in belief
in safety. Of this, all but 0.2 per cent is
explained by age, sex, race, religion, and
education. It is perhaps not unreasonable
to infer that respondents are _ being
influenced, in large measure, by media
and word-of-mouth reports concerning the
pill’s possible dangers.

In spite of growing concern about
safety, do respondents tend to discount
this cost in the trade-off with the dual
advantages of effectiveness and convenience? A question inserted in all the surveys, after the one on safety, allows us to
shed some light on this issue. Respondents
were asked:

Would you recommend these pills to a
woman who does not want more children?

Although there is some known effect of
having asked the question on safety prior
to the one on recommending the pill, we
are not concerned here with the level of
response but rather with the trend. From
Figure 4 we see that the decline in public
confidence in safety is reflected in a diminished willingness to recommend oral
contraception to a woman desiring birth
control protection. Among women under
age 30, the decline is very marked and
goes as far back as 1973, indicating perhaps that young women were beginning to
feel uncertain at that time even though
their expressed belief in safety was not yet
affected.

The importance of opinions on safety to
a willingness to recommend oral contraception is illustrated by the results of a

Have we any evidence that respondents
are making trade-offs? In other words, is it
not obvious that a negative opinion of the
pill’s safety leads to a negative view of the

 

advisability of using it, as in the “would

evidence that trade-offs are entering into
responses. After the question on recom

mending the pill, respondents were asked
on all of the surveys:

Do you think they should be made available
to teenage girls?

Again, we will not concern ourselves so
much with the level of response as with
the trend.

Figure 5 shows that over the years a
rising proportion of respondents has been
willing to allow teenage girls to have oral
contraceptives. Even during the most recent period, 1974-76, when there has been
a sharp increase in concern over Safety,
respondents’ views regarding pills for
teenagers either remain unchanged (as
with men) or increase in approval (as with
women aged under 30 and 30-44). These
results are explained by Figure 6 which
plots, for each date, willingness to make
pills available to teenage girls on the part
of those who explicitly do not believe in
safety. Even nonbelievers in the pill’s
safety showed a steady increase over time
in willingness to make such contraceptives
available to teenagers. Apparently, when
asked about teenagers, some respondents
see clear trade-offs between health risks of
the pill and other deleterious consequences
such as illegitimacy. Perhaps some even
feel that teenagers have “rights” to contraception in spite of health risks.

Another way of putting this result is to
note that a Multiple Classification Analysis
using the same background variables as
were used in the analysis of the “would you
recommend” question plus opinions about
safety yielded an adjusted R? of 21.2 per
cent in contrast to 37 per cent explained
variance using similar predictors for the
“would you recommend” question. Moreover, whereas background variables explained very little variance in the “would
you recommend” regression, in the teenage
analysis over half of the overall adjusted R?
(11.80 percentage points out of a total of
21.2) was due to the effect of background
factors and only 9.4 percentage points (out

Costs of Fertility Control 275

of 21.2) to the unique effect of a concern
with safety. It appears that respondents are
less willing to sacrificé safety in the case of
an adult woman (who has, and probably
will employ, other birth control options)
than in the case of a teenager (who may be
more willing to use the pill than some other
method and whose risk of illegitimate
pregnancy has been escalating in recent
years).

WHAT DOES “SAFE” MEAN?

Given the sharp rise during the past two
years in public concern over the piil’s
safety, we are interested in knowing what
substantive meaning is attached to designations of the pill as being safe or unsafe.
There is no conclusive approach to this
problem; but in the August, 1976, survey
some questions were added that may give
a sense of what respondents have in mind.

First, there seemed to be some merit in
asking people to rank the pill against a
nonprescription drug that has earned
widespread public confidence over many
years of mass usage. Aspirin is a good
example of such a drug in that, for most
people, it is remarkably free of serious side
effects when taken in reasonable doses.

Respondents were posed the following
question:

Which answer on this card (hand respondent
Card 2) best describes how you would rank
the safety of being on the pill compared with
aspirin? Say, taking two aspirins a day. Just
give me your view since no one knows for
sure,

1. Being on the pill is probably safer than
taking two aspirins a day

2. Being on the pill ranks the same as taking
two aspirins a day

3. Being on the pill is probably somewhat
less safe than taking two aspirins a day

4. Being on the pill is probably a lot less safe
than taking two aspirins a day

lieved the pill is safe, almost half of this
group (47 per cent) meant that it is as safe

cent ranked it as being somewhat less safe
than aspirin, and only 13 per cent believed
it to be a lot less safe than aspirin. On the
assumption that ingesting two aspirins a

day is regarded by respondents as relatively benign behavior, then we can state
that those who believe the pill to be safe
appear to have high confidence in its lack
of injurious effects on health.

By contrast, the 51 per cent who
deemed the pill unsafe also ranked it low

compared with aspirin. Fifty-one per cent
said that it is a lot less safe than aspirin,
and 25 per cent regarded it as somewhat
less safe. It seems important to note that
few in this group claiming that the pill is
unsafe seem to have been general alarmists about drugs, since few said that the
pill (although unsafe) is as safe or safer
than aspirin.

Respondents who had expressed no
opinion as to safety tended to rank the pill
as somewhat or a lot less safe than aspirin
in so far as an opinion was expressed at all
on this issue.

After the question on aspirin, respondents were asked to rank the safety of the
pill relative to that of cigarette smoking:

And how about ordinary cigarettes—not the
low tar, heavy filter kind. Which answer on
this card (hand respondent Card 3) best describes how you would rank the safety of
being on the pill compared with smoking a
pack of ordinary cigarettes a day?

1. Being on the pill is probably safer than
smoking a pack a day

2. Being on the pill ranks the same as smoking a pack a day

3. Being on the pill is probably somewhat
less safe than smoking a pack a day

4. Being on the pill is probably a lot less safe
than smoking a pack a day

5. Other answer

6. No opinion

As with aspirin, we have no objective
measure of respondents’ views on Cigarette
smoking. However, if we make the tenta
tive assumption that most people today
think that smoking may be bad for health,

 

we can indicate how the pill measures up
alongside cigarettes.

We see (Table 2) that almost 64 per cent
of the respondents who believed the pill to
be safe judged it as safer than smoking a
pack a day of regular unfiltered cigarettes.
Interestingly, even those who believed the
pill to be unsafe did not, on the whole,
rank it as being much worse than cigarettes; only 18 per cent gave this response.
Fifty-four per cent thought it was as safe
or safer than smoking. Hence, even the
most anxious majority of respondents did
not view the pill as a worse threat to
health than a habit (however harmful)
whose prevalence far exceeds that of pill
use. Even if all respondents regarded
smoking as a harmful habit, they would
doubtless all be able to name behaviors
that are more damaging. It is useful to
know that, for most respondents, the pill
does not fall into the latter category.

Finally, respondents were asked to sum
up their views of the pill in the following
manner:

Just to sum up, which of the answers on this

card (hand respondent Card 4) best expresses
your view about the safety of the pill?

1. I think the pill is a completely safe
method of birth control

2. I think the pill is probably a pretty safe
method of birth control

3. I think the pill definitely involves some
health risks

4. I think the pill is really dangerous to
health

5. Other answer

6. No opinion.

In response to this question (Table 3), approximately 60 per cent of those who had
initially claimed the pill to be safe judged
it as being completely safe, or probably
pretty safe. However, another one-third
felt it definitely involved health risks.
Such an answer is not incompatible with
the initial claim that it can be used “without danger to a person’s health,” since a
risk does not necessarily imply real
danger.

More important is the fact that the preponderance of those who initially regarded
the pill as unsafe did not believe it to be
“really dangerous.” Only 28 per cent gave
this response. An additional 61 per cent
claimed that it definitely involves health
risks.

In sum, although over time there is obviously mounting anxiety about the safety
of the pill, there is as yet no general sense
of panic. Even among those who feel it is
unsafe, only a minority are willing to label

it as “really dangerous.” Nonetheless, the
research literature on the health consequences of oral contraception suggests that
added knowledge will not be reassuring.
As people come to share this knowledge
during the next few years, we may expect
that they will regard the pill even more
negatively than has been the case to date.
Increasingly, Americans will thus have to
trade off a sense of physical danger
against the effectiveness and convenience
of oral contraception.

POSTSCRIPT

Since the time of writing, more recent data
on attitudes toward the pill have become
available. Preliminary tabulations from
questions commissioned on a Gallup survey in July, 1977, show an additional sharp
drop in confidence concerning the safety of
the pill. At that time, only 29 per cent of

men and 25 per cent of women believed the
pill to be safe compared with 38 per cent
and 32 per cent respectively in August,
1976, and 43 per cent for both sexes in
September, 1974. By the summer of 1977,
48 per cent of men and 62 per cent of
women claimed that the pill is unsafe. In
effect, by July, 1977, lack of confidence in
the pill’s safety was more widespread than
it had been right after the beginning of the
Nelson hearings in January, 1970, when 42
