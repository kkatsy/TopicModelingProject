Interracial Marriage and Admixture

in Hawati

Michener’s phrase “the golden men of
Hawaii” reflects a popular romantic interest
in the blending of ethnic elements that has
been going on in Hawaii for almost two
centuries. More seriously, if less romantically, scholars have been analyzing interracial marriages and intermixture and attempting to trace their effects on the emergent population of Hawaii (Adams, 1937;
Hormann, 1948; Lind, 1967; Cheng and
Yamamura, 1957; Taeuber, 1962; Schmitt,
1965). A landmark study, Genetics of Interracial Crosses in Hawatt, published by the
geneticist Newton E. Morton and his associates in 1967, has given us a valuable comparison of “mixed” and “unmixed” children born in Hawaii, through a detailed
analysis of nearly 180,000 births registered
during the eleven-year period 1948-58.

Part of the focus of the present paper is
upon demographic, cultural, and social factors that must have affected genetic changes
in Hawaii’s population, even though some
of these considerations must be somewhat
impressionistic. Moreover, it is necessary to
interpret the usual measures of interracial
marriage and racial admixture on which
studies of genetic changes in Hawail might
be based. Such an interpretation points to
am even greater breakdown in traditional

 

mating patterns and subsequent genetic
recombinations than the statistical evidence
indicates.

CHANGING DEFINITIONS OF
“RACIAL’’? CATEGORIES

Hawaii is fortunate in having census
data for a longer period than any other
area in the Pacific. Census reports go back
to 1847, but there have been many variations in the “racial” categories used as well
as in the actual racial make-up of the people
designated by certain categories (Schmitt,
1968). These variations reflect changing
social definitions of ethnic groups in Hawaii’s population and the changing circumstances under which interracial marriage has taken place. The 1853 census, for
example, used the terms “natives” and
“half-natives” for groups later called ‘Hawaiians” and ‘“Part-Hawaiians”. The general term “foreign population” was subdivided to differentiate Portuguese from
other Europeans, Americans from Europeans, and Chinese and Filipinos as other
categories of foreigners. The term “halfcastes” was used from 1866 to 1890. The
censuses of 1910, 1920, and 1930 attempted
to differentiate between ‘‘Caucasian-Hawaiians” and “‘Asiatic-Hawaiians”; those of

278

Vol. 17, No. 4

1940, 1950, and 1960 used the term “‘PartHawalians” for all persons reporting any
Hawaiian admixture; the 1970 census does
not differentiate between Hawaiians and
Part-Hawailans, all being reported as “‘Hawaiians.” Although some Japanese immigrants arrived in 1868, “Japanese” was not
made a separate category until 1884, just
before a major wave of Japanese immigration got underway in 1885. Negroes were
not listed separately until 1900, following
annexation to the United States in 1898.
Filipino, Korean, Puerto Rican, and Spanish
became regularly listed categories in 1910,
but Spanish and Portuguese were eliminated
after the 1930 census.

By 1853, the Hawaiians (persons nominally of unmixed Hawaiian descent) had
declined to 70,000 from the 300,000 that, by
best estimates, populated the Hawaiian
islands at the time of Captain Cook’s
arrival in 1778. Those claiming to be full
Hawaiians have continued to decline, down
to a figure of only slightly above 10,000,
according to the 1960 census. While mortality rates, particularly infant mortality
rates, have been considerably higher among
Hawaiians than among other groups in Hawail, the decline during the last century is
attributable more to high rates of outmarriage among the Hawaiians and the consequent listing of their children among the
rapidly growing Part-Hawaiian population.
In fact, the actual number of unmixed Hawatians has decreased more than is shown
by the census, because of the inclusion of
many part-Hawaiians in the Hawaiian
group.

Even in 1853, the distinction between
Hawaiians and Part-Hawaiians was imprecise. The 983 “half-natives’’ listed must
be regarded as persons who had the social
position of “half-native” rather than as the
entire number of part-Hawaiians. During
the 75 years after foreign contact began in
1778, many children of Hawaiian mothers
and foreign fathers, mainly Caucasians, had

Hawaiian Interracial Marriage 279

been reared as Hawaiians and absorbed into
the indigenous group, a process facilitated
by the widespread practices among Hawaiians of adoption and rearing of children
by women older than the natural mothers.
As a result of continued absorption of partHawaiians into the Hawaiian group since
1853, those now claiming to be “full-Hawaiians” include a large number of persons
with admixture of other racial ancestries.
On the basis of blood-type evidence, Morton, Chung, and Mi concluded that the “HaWalians” in their study showed 8.5% Caucasian admixture and 13.7% Chinese admixture, with at least 44% having some
combination of Chinese-Caucasian admixture. Some, but fewer, Part-Hawaiians have
been absorbed into other racial groups,
primarily Caucasian and Chinese. Even
with these losses, by 1950 the Part-Hawalians (those of recognized mixed ancestry)
had become larger in numbers than the
entire population of Hawaii in 1853 (73,845
compared with 73,137) and they increased
to 91,597 by 1960, an increase of over 24%
during the period 1950-60. Moreover, these
figures do not reveal the extensive migration
of Part-Hawaiians from Hawaii to the mainland United States during the 1950’s (Taeuber, 1962).

MISCEGENATION SEQUENCE

Racial intermixture in Hawaii, which began with the intermingling between Hawailans and successive immigrant groups
and which has continued with intermixture
among the immigrant groups themselves,
has occurred under the social rubric that
has been called Hawaii’s “unorthodox race
doctrine” (Adams, 1934). Adams reconstructed the conditions which led to the
public sanctioning of marriages between Hawaiians and foreigners, by both the ruling
Hawalian elite and the Protestant missionaries who arrived in the 1820’s. As
Adams (1934), Lind (1967), and others have
shown, this doctrine was later challenged by

the development of a hierarchal social structure on the plantations and military posts
in the Islands, but it nevertheless prevailed.
Even though prejudices among some individuals of all ethnic groups have affected
some intimate and personal social relations,
including mate selection, the doctrine has
led to a remarkably open society for intergroup and interpersonal relations,

The development of Hawaii’s multiracial
population has been largely a consequence
of successive waves of immigration. Without going into historical details, we can consider typical phases of miscegenation that
occurred as most of the ethnic groups came
into Hawaii: (1) a phase of relatively extensive admixture between foreign men and
local women, largely through casual relations and “marriages of convenience”
(Hormann, 1948); (2) a phase of relative
decline of intermixture as each immigrant
group attempted to establish an ethnic
society discouraging out-marriage and encouraging in-group marriage through arranged marriages; (3) the current phase of
increase in out-marriages by Americanized
members of the Hawaii-born descendants
of immigrants, typified by “marriages of
romance.” I believe that the phases also
characterize other island areas of Oceania,
although not many South Pacific island
communities have advanced as far into the
third phase as has Hawaii.

In the first phase, nearly all incoming
foreigners were adult males. During most of
the period, the local women were mainly
Hawaiian and, later, Part-Hawaiian. In the
earliest part of this phase, miscegenation
was largely through casual relations, with
the offspring being absorbed into the indigenous population. Some early European
men who were placed in high positions in
Hawaiian society because of their services
to Hawaiian chiefs were given Hawaiian
wives of high status, and their offspring were
integrated into the Hawaiian elite. As the
numbers of resident European men—trad
Social Biology

ers, artisans, and others—increased, more
of them established permanent relations
with Hawaiian women and shared in the
rearing of their children. As a rule, the
children of these families were not regarded
as a distinct racial or social group, although
they were frequently referred to as hapahaoles (persons of mixed Hawaiian and
European ancestry). Since the Europeans
were concentrated in the port towns, the
hapa-haoles were also, and as more European
men came into the towns, more of them
married hapa-haole women, so there was an
increasing number of Part-Hawaiians who
approached the European physical type. At
the same time, since some Part-Hawaiian
women married Hawaiian or Part-Hawaiian
men, and most Part-Hawaiian men married
Hawaiians or Part-Hawaiians, the PartHawaiians who approached the Hawaiian
physical type increased more rapidly than
those approaching the European type.
Many of these were absorbed into the indigenous population and became identified
simply as Hawaiians.

In the second phase, when substantial
numbers of European women were brought
to Hawaii during the latter half of the nineteenth century, a settled European community of ranked families became established.
The development of a haole (‘‘white”) managerial class on the plantations, and a haole
business community in the towns, with
wives from Europe and America, led to
efforts to discourage continued intermixture
between members of this community and
the Hawaiians and Part-Hawailians, although intermarriage with members of the
Hawaiian and Part-Hawaiian elite was
tolerated.

The importation of Chinese males as
plantation laborers, beginning in 1852 and
continuing intermittently until the end of
the century, produced a similar sequence.
Coming to Hawaii without women, a considerable number of these Chinese men
lived with Hawaiian or Part-Hawaiian

Vol. 17, No. 4

women, and a Chinese-Hawaiian population
emerged. When Chinese wives were finally
brought in, a Chinese community developed, particularly in the larger towns. A few
Chinese-Hawalians were absorbed into it,
mainly by marriages of Chinese-Hawaiian
women to Chinese men, but the practice of
arranged marriages in the Chinese community encouraged in-group marriage among
the early generations of Hawaii-born Chinese, The majority of the Chinese-Hawaiians had closer ties to their Hawaiian mothers’ families and to the Hawaiian community than to their Chinese fathers’ ethnic
group.

Two other large groups later imported as
plantation laborers—Japanese, beginning in
the 1880’s, and Filipinos, mainly after
World War I—went through a similar sequence, but with important modifications
that cannot be detailed here. One exception
was the Portuguese who, from their first
importations for plantation labor in the
late 1870’s, came in with wives and children
so that a relatively small proportion of the
first generation immigrant men out-married.

With increasing Americanization of all
the peoples of Hawaii, arranged marriages
in Hawaii’s Asian groups diminished and
have been largely replaced by “marriages of
romance.” Except for the Filipinos, these
groups now have third, fourth, and even
some fifth Hawaii-born generations. During
the second phase of the miscegenation sequence, the mating barriers erected by
immigrant groups establishing ethnic communities were based on coinciding cultural
and “racial” differences. However, the extent to which racial categories continue to
represent distinctive cultural groups has
been declining. Acculturation to American
life styles has reduced cultural differences
between Hawaii-born descendants of different immigrant groups as well as between
those of Hawaiian and non-Hawatian ancestry.

 

Hawaiian Interracial Marriage 281

Older and younger generations of the
same ethnic group have become culturally
more different from each other than are
younger members of different ethnic groups.
With interracial dating publicly accepted
(although privately resisted by many parents), interracial marriages have increased.
Differences in intermarriage rates, however, indicate that ethnic mating boundaries have not completely disappeared, even
when other demographic facts are accounted
for, Such facts include high sex ratios for
males of marriageable age within the Filipino and Caucasian populations, with corresponding higher out-marriage rates among
males than females. Groups with more balanced sex ratios show an inverse tendency
toward higher out-marriage rates among the
females than the males. When ethnic differences decline as barriers to marriage the
greater availability of unmarried males in
other groups is reflected In more out-marriages of females from the groups with a
more balanced sex ratio (Cheng and Yamamura, 1957).

The smaller ethnic groups, such as Koreans and Puerto Ricans—each only about
one per cent of Hawaii’s population of
about 750,000—tend to show higher outmarriage rates for females than do larger
groups such as the Japanese where there are
larger numbers of in-group males of marriageable age from whom to select mates.
But even when the effects of these demographic variables are allowed for, one still
finds differences in predilection toward outmarriage. Time of arrival of the immigrant
generation becomes relevant here; groups
which have been in the Islands longer
(Chinese, Portuguese) tend to have higher
out-marriage rates than those with a shorter
history in the Islands (Japanese, Filipinos).
It may be inferred that those of marriageable
age in the latter groups are more responsive
to traditional ethnic influences on mate
selection.

EXTENT OF OUT-MARRIAGE

Reports on marriage by race of bride and
groom began in 1912; by that year mate
selection through dating rather than parental arrangement was already underway;
the earlier immigrant groups were in the
second or third phases of the miscegenation
sequence, although the Filipino group,
whose immigration was just beginning, was
in the first phase. Trends of in-marriage and
out-marriage since 1912 are suggested by
Table 1, which shows that out-marriages
have increased from 11.5% of all marriages
for 1912-16 to 36.1% for 1960-69. Table 2
gives more detailed data about the racial
identity of brides and grooms in the 23,713
out-marriages in 1960-69. Marriages during
this decade represented all except three of
the hundred possible combinations of brides
and grooms among the ten identified categories. The two combinations with the largest numbers (3,006 and 2,301) were marriages of Caucasians and Part-Hawaiians;
the next two largest numbers were of marriages of Caucasian grooms with Japanese
and Filipino brides (1,660 and 1,422 respectively). The other two combinations in
which over 1,000 out-marriages were registered were those of Filipino men with PartHawalian women and of Part-Hawaiian
men with Japanese women.

Interpretation of the data in Tables 1
and 2 must take into account some of the
ambiguities in the racial categories used and
the question of what constitutes an “‘interracial marriage.” Those interested in the
genetic implications of these marriages will
recognize that the data conceal much relevant information.

In the first place, if one accepts the categories used in these tables as referring to
“races” or “racial groups,” as has been
common in Hawaii for decades, then an
interracial marriage is a marriage between
persons of two different categories, for example, bride Hawaiian, groom Chinese.
Following the same principle, a marriage of

Social Biology

a Hawaiian to a Part-Hawaiian is counted
as interracial. The inconsistency of this distinction is apparent when one realizes that a
high proportion, if not most, of those classified as Hawaiians have, in fact, some
Caucasian or Asian ancestry, or both.
Beyond this, one may consider the anthropologists’ conclusions that the Polynesian
peoples, including the Hawaiians, are themselves a blend of elements loosely identified
as proto-Caucasoid and proto-Malayoid.
Further uncertainty about the genetic constitution of the “pre-contact’”? Hawaiian
population is added by the possibility of
Melanesian Negroid elements in some of the
Polynesian peoples, suggested by recent
evidence of interrelationships between Polynesian and Melanesian cultures. Leaving
aside these speculations, it is fairly certain
that the boundary between those now calling themselves Hawaiians and those identified as Part-Hawaiians is becoming increasingly blurred. At the same time, there
is a great range in physical appearance
among the Part-Hawatians, from very ‘“Hawalian-looking” to blue-eyed blonds. In
view of this, a marriage between two PartHawaiians may quite possibly represent a
“more interracial” marriage than one between a Hawaiian and a Part-Hawaiian.
Similarly, a marriage between a Caucasian
groom and the blue-eyed Part-Hawaiian
may be “less interracial” than one between
a Hawaiian and a Part-Hawaiian, or between two Caucasians where one is of North
European ancestry and the other of Italian
or Portuguese descent.

This last example calls attention to a
change in the practice of reporting race in
Hawaii which has affected the definition of
“interracial marriage” in the Islands. In
line with continental United States practice,
all Caucasians are now lumped together in
the Hawaiian statistics (the term ‘Caucasian” being used in Hawaii instead of the
term ‘‘white” as on the mainland), When
annual data on interracial marriages began

Vol. 17, No. 4

to be issued in 1912, the Portuguese and
Spanish groups, which had originally been
imported as plantation laborers, were reported as categories separate from “Other
Caucasians,” the term used in census reports
mainly for persons of North European origin
known locally as haoles. Following this practice, a marriage between a Spanish groom
and a Portuguese bride was counted as interracial, as would have been a marriage between an “Other Caucasian” groom and a
Spanish or Portuguese bride; however, the
children of a Spanish-Portuguese marriage,
as well as of a marriage of an “Other Caucasian” to Spanish or Portuguese, were
classified as “Other Caucasians.” With decrease in numbers of the Spanish and Portuguese groups, as a consequence of their
migration in large numbers to the mainland
and their high rates of out-marriage (especially to “Other Caucasians’) and with their
objection to being categorized separately
from “Other Caucasians,” the categories
“Portuguese,” “Spanish” and “Other Caucasians” were dropped as census classifications for Hawaii in 1940, and all were
reported as “Caucasians.’”’ While the Spanish have largely disappeared as a social category in Hawaii, Portuguese are still widely
identified as a distinct ethnic group.

Even though distinctions between subgroups of Caucasians have been dropped
from official statistics in Hawaii, several
government agencies of the state have continued to differentiate between different
categories of Asians. As Tables 2 and 4 show,
Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, and Filipinos
are still differentiated in marriage and birth
statistics. It could probably be maintained
that marriage between a Japanese and a
Korean is genetically “less interracial” than
one between a Caucasian of North European
descent and an island-born Portuguese. In
other words, maintaining boundaries between subtypes of Asians while ignoring
distinctions between subtypes of Caucasians
leads to a somewhat inconsistent usage of
the term “interracial marriage.”

 

Hawaiian Interracial Marriage 285

The artificial character of official categories as indicating cultural and genetic
mating boundaries is further revealed when
one notes that the subcategories of Asians,
particularly such as the Chinese and Filipinos, refer to quite heterogeneous populations. The Chinese in Hawaii came largely
from the Canton area of Kwangtung Province, an area that had extensive contacts
with Southeast Asia, and even more distant
regions, for centuries before Chinese came
to Hawaii. Undoubtedly many mixed offspring of Chinese were brought back and
absorbed into the Cantonese population,
just as some Chinese-Hawaiian children
were taken back to the Canton area from
Hawaii. Even the Chinese population in Hawali has some Hawatian admixture, because,
as we know, some persons with some Hawaiian ancestry live and are known in Hawaii
as “Chinese.” Filipino immigrants came to
Hawaii after there had been centuries of
admixture of the indigenous Filipino peoples
with Chinese and Spanish in the Philippines.

Two smaller groups in Hawaii which
are heterogeneous, Puerto Rican and Negroes—each constituting about one per cent
of the population—are also treated as
“races” in computing interracial marriages,
even though it is obvious that a marriage
between a Puerto Rican and a Negro, or
between a Negro and a Caucasian, could
very well be “‘less interracial” than one between two Puerto Ricans or two Negroes,

While maintaining distinctions between
large categories of Asians, Hawaiian statistical reporting ignores some socially and
culturally defined subgroups within these
categories. For a long time after their migration to Hawaii, Chinese of the “‘Punti”
group and those of the “Hakka” group
considered themselves physically and culturally distinct and did not arrange or
sanction marriages between members of the
two groups. Among the Filipinos who migrated to Hawaii there were marked linguistic and other cultural differences, such
as those between the Ilocanos, Tagalogs,

286 Glick

and Visayans. In Hawaii, all Filipinos are
treated as a single group, even though
ethnic differences among them were traditional mating boundaries in the Philippines
and continued to be, to some extent, in Hawali, Two groups of immigrants classified
together as “Japanese” in Hawaiian statistics were those from Okinawa and those
from the main islands of Japan (referred to
in Hawaii as ‘‘Naichi”). Japanese ‘‘Naichi”
rejected the idea of arranging marriages between their children and those of Okinawans
and continued for a long time to disapprove
‘“Naichi”-Okinawan dating and intermarriage (Yamamoto, 1957).

Even if one were to ignore the imprecision of “racial” classifications, interpreting
the data is complicated by the arbitrary
rules followed in assigning individuals to
categories, a complication of which demographers are well aware. Statistical reporting in Hawaii follows general United States
practice except for persons of Hawaiian
ancestry. Any child who has one Hawaiian
or Part-Hawaiian parent is classified as
Part-Hawaiian. This means that, in Hawaii, a child of a Hawaiian or Part-Hawaiian
parent and a Negro would be classified as
Part-Hawaiian. As on the mainland, a child
of a Caucasian parent and a non-Caucasian
(other than Hawaiian or Part-Hawatiian)
parent is classified by the race of the nonCaucasian parent, and if both parents are
non-Caucasian (but neither is Hawaiian,
Part-Hawaiian, or Negro) the child is
classified by the race of the father. The
cumulative effect of the rule regarding HaWallan ancestry has been to rapidly increase
the Part-Hawaiian group. However, the
cumulative effects of increasing out-marriages between Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos,
and Koreans cannot be observed because
the children of these intermarriages are
classified back into the paternal groups.

One estimate is that by 1968 there were
65,500 persons of mixed ancestry other than
Part-Hawaiians, the latter being approxi
Social Biology

mately twice that number (State of Hawaii
Department of Planning and Economic
Development, 1970). Nearly all of these
“other mixtures” would be reported as
Japanese, Chinese, Filipinos, or Koreans,
and in 1968 they would have constituted
about one-fifth of the total population for
these four categories. Nearly all would be
under age 30, the majority not yet of marriageable age. However, an undeterminable
number of marriages are already taking
place in which, for example, the groom is
Chinese and the bride Chinese-Japanese, or
the groom Japanese and the bride JapaneseKorean. These marriages do not appear as
“interracial” marriages whereas a marriage
between 2a Hawaiian and a Part-Hawaiian
is counted as “interracial.” This type of
distortion will increase as more of the
“other mixtures” reach marriageable age;
moreover, even if birth rates generally
decline in the Islands, the proportion of
these ‘“‘other mixtures” in the reported
population of the four groups will increase
in succeeding generations. It is evident that
the very increase in interracial marriage
over generations will increase our difficulty
in using statistical data as clues to the
genetic make-up of the population or the
rate at which “interracial marriage” is going
on.
EXTENT OF ADMIXTURE

A related difficulty arises in attempting
to analyze the character and extent of amalgamation resulting from interracial marriage and miscegenation. Table 3 indicates
the extent of admixture reported for two
periods: July 1931 through December 1950,
and the 1960’s. Table 4 provides more detailed information on live births by race of
known parents for the 1960’s. Taking the
figures at face value, one sees that the proportion of children of mixed racial ancestry
in Hawaii’s population continued to rise
from the already high 31.2% of the earlier
period to 36.8% for the last decade. The
latter figure is almost the same as the per

centage (36.1%) of interracial marriages
reported in Table 2 for the same period.
However, marriages between Part-Hawailans were not counted as interracial marriages, whereas children of such marriages
are naturally included among those of
mixed ancestry. If the marriages between
Part-Hawaiians were added to the outmarriages in Table 2, the percentage would
rise 43.7%. The births of children of mixed
ancestry, therefore, appear to be somewhat
below the potentialities suggested by the
intermarriage rates.

However, drawing inferences about fertility of interracial] marriages involves coping with several unknowns. In the first
place, of course, not all the brides in Table 2
are the same persons as the mothers in
Table 4. Many of the mothers of racial
intercrosses born during the years 1960-69
were married before 1960, and many brides
who outmarried during 1960-69 may have
had no children during that period or may
have had them after moving away from Hawali. The relatively large number of military
personnel and dependents in Hawaii (nearly

 

one-seventh of the state’s estimated population on January 1, 1969) also affects the
analysis, since a substantial proportion of
the Caucasian grooms in interracial marriages have been of this group during most of
the last four decades, With reassignment of
military personnel, a considerable number
of Hawaii-born, non-Caucasian wives leave
the Islands during the years they are most
likely to have children. Still a further important variable is suggested by the fact that
50% of the Caucasian brides and 47% of
the Caucasian grooms were married in the
last three years of the decade, after Hawaii
became a major meeting place for men on
“R & R” from Vietnam with their mainland
girl friends.

The out-marriage rate for Caucasian
grooms dropped from 34.5% for 1960-66 to
only 21.1% for these three “R & R years.”
Children born to most of the couples in the
“R & R marriages” will not be born in Hawail. On the other hand, a large number of
Caucasian wives of Caucasian service-men
have children while their husbands are
stationed in Hawaii, and their children are

counted in Hawaii’s birth statistics. Most
of these circumstances work in the direction
of reducing the percentage of “mixed” children in the total births recorded in Hawaii.

Another important unknown relates to
the fact, already noted, that by 1967 an
estimated 65,500 ractally mixed individuals,
mostly of Asian intercrosses, were classified
simply as Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos, or
Koreans. The children of any of these individuals who marry an “unmixed” Asian of
the same category will actually be “mixed,”
although they would not be so recorded in
such annual reports as those on which
Table 4 is based. The assumption is that
this distortion is not yet substantial but it
will become increasingly great.

Under-enumeration of children of mixed
racial ancestry also comes from the practice
of classifying as “unmixed” those children
whose parents are both identified as Hawalian, even though a large percentage of
‘““Hawaiians” have some Caucasian or Asian
admixture. The same is true of many children whose parents are both Puerto Rican
or both Negro.

Finally, Table 4 does not include illegitimate births except where the race of both
parents is known. During the period 1960—
69, 10,732 live births were reported for
whom the race of the father was unknown;
in all but 235 cases the race of the mother
was reported. Thirty-nine per cent of the
mothers were Part-Hawaiians and another
3% were Hawaiians; the other large groups
were Caucasian (24%), Filipino (12%), and
Japanese (9%). It can reasonably be assumed that many more than half of these
infants were of mixed ancestry.

In view of these unknowns, it is not possible to make any reliable comparisons in
quantitative terms of the fertility of interracial and in-group marriages. About the
best that can be said is that the fertility of
interracial marriages appears to be at least
equal to and probably higher than that of
in-group marriages. Neither do available

 

 

Hawaiian Interracial Marriage 289

data permit conclusions about the demographic and social factors, usually associated
with fertility rates, as they pertain to interracial marriages. The nearest approach to
such conclusions comes from the findings of
Schmitt’s (1968) study of demographic factors in interracial marriages occurring in
Hawaii in 1961 and 1962. He found that
interracial marriage rates were higher (1) in
rural Hawaii; (2) for brides under 20; (3)
for couples in operative, service, and laborer
categories; and (4) for couples with lower
than median incomes. Ordinarily these variables have been associated with higher
rather than lower fertility rates.

MATING BOUNDARIES AND
“RACIAL” ADMIXTURE

Another approach to analyzing interracial marriage is suggested by Table 5,
which shows selected combinations of marriages. If one were to assume that traditional mating boundaries would be weakest
between “racially similar” groups, with
“race” being thought of along traditional
lines, one might expect that out-marriages
of members of the four most “racially
similar” groups in Hawaii—Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, and Filipinos—would be
predominantly with members of another of
these subgroups of Asians. However, as
Table 5 shows, only about a fifth of the
out-marriages by Asians were with members
of the other Asian groups. More than twice
as many married Caucasians, and almost
twice as many married Hawaiians or PartHawaiians. Of the total out-marriages included in the table, only 11% were Asian
intermarriages, while 43% were between
Asians and non-Asians. Assuming that marriages between Part-Hawaiians are actually,
even though not officially, interracial, outmarriages among the Hawaiians and PartHawaiians were about one-third with Asians,
one-third with Caucasians, and one-third
with other Hawaiians and Part-Hawaiians.
Of the Caucasians out-marrying, a few more

married Asians than married Hawaiians
or Part-Hawaiians. Since many Part-Hawallans are much more “racially similar’
to Caucasians than are Asians, one might
have expected a higher proportion of Caucasians to marry Part-Hawaiians, if “race”
were of prime importance. It appears from
these data that “racial similarity” is not
compelling as a predisposing factor in interracial marriages in Hawaii.

Using the same combinations in considering live births reported in 1960-69, it will
be seen from Table 6 that Asian intercrosses
made up only 10% of all the “mixed”? children reported, while 16% were Asian-Caucasian intercrosses and nearly a fourth were
intercrosses of Asian and Hawaiian or PartHawatian parentage. Hawalian—Part-Hawalian and Part-Hawailian intercrosses made

up a much higher proportion of the children
than did Hawaiian-Caucasian or HawaiianAsian intercrosses. The percentage of intercrosses having a Caucasian parent and an
Asian parent was only a little less than that
of intercrosses having a Caucasian parent
and a Hawaiian or Part-Hawaiian parent.

A quick comparison of Tables 5 and 6
might suggest the hypothesis of higher fertility in the marriages among the Hawaiians
and Part-Hawaiians, but the data may be
misleading. For one thing, more of the children of intermarriages between people of
Hawaiian ancestry may be born in Hawaii
than children of Caucasian and Hawaiian
or Asian parentage, since many of the Caucasian fathers are military men or civilians
who, as we have indicated, move to the
mainland United States and whose children

are born there. Nevertheless, whatever the
factors associated with the differences in
the number of intercrosses of these five
types of combinations, three-fourths of the
intercrosses born during the past decade
have some Hawaiian ancestry. Even though
higher infant mortality rates among Hawailans and Part-Hawaiians will reduce the
proportion of their children who survive,
the “Hawaiian identity” will still remain
for the bulk of intercrosses who live into

Hawaiian Interracial Marriage 291

adult years. Moreover, since there is generally pride in identifying any amount of
Hawaiian ancestry, no matter how small,
the probable continued increase in interracial marriage will spread the Hawaiian
element through the Island population.
This, together with acculturation to American life patterns among all the ethnic groups
in Hawaii’s population, can be expected to
weaken further the traditional culturally
and racially defined mating boundaries,
