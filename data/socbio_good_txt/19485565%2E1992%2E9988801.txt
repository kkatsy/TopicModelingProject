ABSTRACT: This study examines the proximate determinants of fertility in China by making use

"eof the data collected by the One-per-Thousand Sample Fertility Survey of 1982. The results
Yindicate that the most important inhibitor of potential fertility is deliberate control. Its contriAbution to fertility change has been far greater than all other proximate determinants. The marital
structure of the population is also an important factor, while lactational infecundability and
Sinduced abortion are relatively unimportant. Comparative results by using data from the
In-depth Fertility Survey conducted in Shanghai Municipality, Hebei and Shaanxi Provinces in
“April 1985 agree well in the ranking of the four intermediate factors. The findings point to
successful family planning program and government population policies, which propelled the
‘fertility transition to a substantial degree. Further research needs and policy implications of the
Ssesults of the study are discussed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
BONGAARTS MODEL

The observed fertility level of a population can be affected by variations in
any of the intermediate variables as
proposed by Davis and Blake (1956)
and reorganized into eight proximate
determinants by Bongaarts (1978,
1982; Bongaarts and Potter, 1983). He
demonstrated that variation in only
four of them, namely the proportion
married, contraception, induced abortion, and postpartum infecundability,
are of any substantial importance in
the analysis of fertility differences or
trends. The measures which Bongaarts
proposed enable us to assess the impact on the fertility level of each of
these four principal proximate variables at any given point in time or
changes in their impact over time.

The fertility-inhibiting effect of each
proximate determinant is assessed by
comparing an estimate of the fertility
level which would prevail in its presence with that in its absence. The potential fertility level that would prevail
in the absence of the four principal
proximate variables (i.e., under conditions in which all women in the reproductive ages were married and there
was no breastfeeding, induced abortion, or contraception) is called the total fecundity (TF). Even though the
level of total fecundity varies from
population to population due to differences in the other proximate variables,
based on empirical analysis of a number of populations, Bongaarts found
that the total fecundity rate averages
about 15.3 births per women.

In the Bongaarts model, the impact
of the four principal intermediate variables are measured by four indexes,

Social Biology

each ranging from 0 to 1. When an intermediate variable has no fertilityinhibiting effect, the corresponding index equals unity; if the fertility
inhibition is complete, the index equals
zero. Thus, the complement of the index value gives the estimated percentage reduction in fertility due to that
proximate determinant. The four indexes are defined as follows (Bongaarts, 1978):

C., = index of proportion married,
which equals 1 in the absence of
celibacy and 0 in the absence of
marriage;

C, = index of contraception, which
equals 1 in the absence of contraception and 0 if all fecund
women use 100% effective contraception;

C, = index of induced abortion, which
equals 1 in the absence of induced abortion and 0 if all pregnancies are aborted; and,

C; = index of postpartum infecundability, which equals 1 in the absence of lactation and postpartum abstinence and 0 if the
duration of infecundability is infinite.

Since each index equals the proportionate reduction in fertility that it
causes, the total fertility rate (TFR) is
a product of the four indexes times the
total fecundity (TF); that is,

TER = TF*C,,*C.*C,*C, (1)

Each index, therefore, enables us to
compare its relative importance in the
presence of the others. It is worth
stressing that these indices, in particular those referring to contraceptive effectiveness, induced abortion and, to a
lesser extent, postpartum (lactational)

infecundability require a variety of assumptions in order to convert the observed data into proper measures. The
usefulness of the Bongaarts model,
however, does not depend on the availability of absolutely precise estimates
of the required measures. As long as
reasonable estimates are available, the
model is quite useful in assessing the
extent to which the four proximate dewierminants inhibit fertility and how
Stheir contributions change over time.

The data used in this study are from
“the sample survey conducted by the
State Family Planning Commission.
‘Retrospective histories of childbearing
and marriage of women aged 15-67

Study than has been possible until now.
= This study makes use of the relevant
Adata on fertility, contraception, marital
structure, abortion, etc. obtained by
the survey and rearranged for the year
1981 as published in various official
documents by the Chinese Population
Information Centre. The available
data, however, are far from perfect for
this specific study. Some relevant information is not available for very good
estimates of the four indices. Information lacking in the 1982 survey is compensated for by the information drawn

Fertility Decline in China 17

from the experiences of other populations as well as from reasonable speculations.

Based on the equations suggested
by Bongaarts (1978) and Bongaarts
and Potter (1983) to calculate these indexes, Singh et al. (1985) have developed weighted indices for three of the
four proximate variables, excepting
the index C, (because data on abortions are not usually available in many
countries). The present study uses
these weighted indices, since they provide better and more precise estimates
of the effects of the proximate determinants. Moreover, since data on
abortions are available for China, we
suggest a weighted index C, based on
the measurements provided by Bongaarts and Singh et al. The calculations
of the four indices are given in full detail.

1. Index of Marriage C,,, is a fertility
weighted index of proportions married, calculated by taking the weighted
average of the proportions married in
the different age groups with the greatest weights being given to age groups
with high fertility rates.

direct estimate m\15—19) tends to be
unreliable, especially in populations
with low values of m(15-19). The estimate suggested by Bongaarts gives a
value of 0.251. The total fertility rate
(TFR) is 2.621, and the total marital
fertility rate (TM) is 4.63, resulting ina
C,, of 0.566 (see Table 1 for details).

2. Index of Contraception C, is a
weighted index of age-method-specific
proportions currently contracepting
among married women, and agemethod-specific effectiveness levels of
contraception. This index varies inversely with prevalence and use effectiveness of contraception practiced by
couples in the reproductive age groups.
If contraceptive practice is absent or
completely inefficient, C, = 1.0. With
increasing prevalence and effectiveness, C, falls below 1.0. The formula
can be written as follows (Singh et al.,
1985):

WFS surveys (Singh et al., 1985) are
used in this study, with a slight modification for the age group 40~44: 0.85
instead of 0.78, because the latter
seems too low for China. Using these
data, we first calculate Cc(a) through
various steps shown in Table 3. First,
h(a) = 2U(a,m).e(m) are computed
using the figures given in Table 2. For
example, for age group 15-19, h(1549) = (0.005 x 1.0) + (0.094 x 0.95)
et (0.025 x 0.90) + (0.002 x 0.7) +
40.015 x 0.7) = 0.129. Second, each
i(a) is divided by z(a), and then its

complement Cc(a) is calculated. All
other calculations follow thereafter.
This procedure yields a Cc of 0.367 for
China (see Table 3).

is reduced as the consequence of the
practice of induced abortion. Bongaarts and Potter (1983) suggest using

denote the age-specific proportionate
reduction in marital fertility due to induced abortion. The values b(a) are
constant for all ages in Bongaarts; but
here we use age-specific values provided in Qing (1987).

To compute the index of induced
abortion, we first calculate age-specific

induced abortion rates a(a) for evermarried women by considering the
number of abortions in 1981 (Zhongguo Renkou Ziliao Zhongxin, 1987).
Since age-specific births averted per
abortion (b(a)) are unavailable for the
year 1981, we use the information provided by Qing (1987) for the year 1982.
With a(a) and b(a) values, Ca(a) can
be calculated. Thus, the estimated
weighted index of abortion, C,, is finally computed by using the above formula and is found to be 0.843 for China
1981 (see Table 4).

and rural areas. Mean durations of
postpartum amenorrhea are 3.60
months in Shanghai, 5.91 in Hebei,
and 6.07 in Shaanxi (SSB, 1986), yielding a mean of 5.19 months, Considering the fact that a majority of the Chinese population lives in rural areas, the
mean durations of postpartum amenorrhoea should be even longer. For
lack of more precise information, we
assume the average duration of postpartum amenorrhea i(a) to be five
months. Further, using the p(a) and
q(a) values as estimated by Hobcraft
and Little (1984) for calculating the index C, (see Table 5), we finally arrive
at a C, of 0.852 for China and a total
fecundity (TF) of 17.8 (that is, 5*
3.56). While this TF is substantially
higher than the average (15.3) computed by Bongaarts, it is not too far off
from the TF’s computed by other research papers. The difference may be
attributable to several factors, possibly
real (biological) differences or possibly
computational over-estimation of the
fertility-inhibiting effect of any one of
the proximate determinants. In the absence of any other definitive computation of TF for China, we prefer to use

the figure we arrived at and proceed
with the decomposition of the relative
contribution toward fertility decline of
the four proximate determinants.

5. Multiplicative Effects of Proximate
Variables.—Since each index associated with an intermediate variable reveals the proportionate reduction in
fertility that it causes, the total fertility
rate (TFR) is a product of the four indexes times the total fecundity rate
(TF):

TER = C,,*C,*C,*C*TE
= 0.566*0.367*0.832*0.832*17.8
= 2.621

which, as expected, is the observed total fertility rate for 1981. The drastic
reduction from total fecundity (17.8) to
observed fertility (2.62) clearly shows
the great inhibiting effects of the four
intermediate variables.

Given the straightforward multiplicative nature of Bongaarts’s accounting scheme, it is a simple matter to es
Social Biology

timate what fertility would be in the absence of any one or combination of the
indexes. Total fecundity (TF) represents fertility in the absence of all four
determinants. Total marital fertility

(T™ = c= 5 & g{a}) represents fer

ages were married. Total natural mar

(TN = Ca" 5 & tn(a)) represents the

induced abortion. And, total fecundity

(TF = G = 5% tr(a)) represents fertil

the measures estimated for the three
provinces using the In-depth Fertility
Survey data. For all of China, the effect of contraception is the most significant (0.367), followed next by the effect of prevailing marital structure
(0.566). The fertility-inhibiting effects
of abortion (0.832) and of postpartum
infecundability (0.852) are rather
small. The relative importance of the
‘fertility-inhibiting effect of each can be
eexamined more clearly by taking (comnon) logarithms of the four indexes:

Jog (C,,* CR CA* Ci

G.e., log (0.566* 0.367*
2% ().852) = log (0.147);
S.e., (—0.247) + (—0.435) + (—0.080)
co + (~0.069) = (—0.833).

i hese results show that 52.2 per cent
40.435/0.833) of the combined inhibit‘Ang effects on TFR is due to contracepion. Thus, in China, contraceptive
“prevalence has made a far greater contribution to the decline in total fertility
“han any other variable. Next in impor‘dance is the existing marital structure,
resulting in 29.8 per cent (0.247/0.833)
eduction in TFR. Given the almost
shniversal marriage among Chinese
Svomen (from a cohort perspective),
‘Such a large inhibiting effect of the
anarital structure prevailing in 1981 can
Conly be attributed to the compulsory
delay in marriage. The mean age at
marriage rose sharply after 1970: in the
eight years from 1971 to 1979 the increase was twice what the increase had
been in the 21 years from 1950 to 1971.
This conspicuous rise in age at marriage in the 1970’s was certainly enhanced, if not altogether produced, by
government pressures on the program
to reduce the birth rate. The official
policy was “later marriage, longer

0.832*

Fertility Decline in China 23

birth intervals, and fewer children.”’
Women were encouraged to postpone
marriage until age 23 in rural areas and
until age 25 in cities (Tien, 1983).

In sharp contrast to the effects of
marriage and contraception, the contributions made by induced abortion
and lactational infecundability are
small, only 9.6 per cent and 8.4 per
cent, respectively. Thus, it is obvious
that China’s fertility transition is
largely the outcome of increasing deliberate marital fertility control.

A comparison of the indices with
those attained by Gao et al. (1989) for
Shanghai Municipality and Hebei and
Shaanxi Provinces throws light on
changes over time and differences
among provinces in the inhibiting effects of the proximate determinants
(see Table 6). Shanghai Municipality is
the largest industrial base, where various socioeconomic and health service
indicators, such as per-capita income,
educational attainment, and medical
services are among the highest in
China. Shaanxi and Hebei, on the contrary, are predominantly rural. All indices of proximate determinants for
these two provinces have higher values, and hence lower fertility-inhibiting effects. Contraception has a more
pronounced effect in 1985 as in 1981,
especially in Shanghai. The effect of
marital structure too is more pronounced in Shanghai than in other
provinces.

Unlike the rural provinces, however, the 1985 estimates show that
induced abortion has a rather high inhibiting effect in Shanghai, and postpartum infecundability the least. The
reason for high induced abortion is unclear. A possible explanation lies in the
fact that the Shanghai Municipality

authorities paid more attention to the
practice of abortion among those who
failed to use contraceptive methods
and went on to conceive unwanted
pregnancies.

The estimates we have obtained for
the whole of China in 1981 seem to
hold true for rural provinces like
Shaanxi and Hebei in 1985. An overall
comparison reveals a good agreement
in the order of importance of the four
proximate determinants with the averages of the three localities, excepting
the unique feature of induced abortion
in Shanghai. On the whole, ruralurban as well as regional differences in
the contribution of the four proximate
determinants to reducing fertility do
persist in China.

Bongaarts (1983) classified populations into four transition phases according to different fertility levels: (a)
TFR over 6.0, mainly in the developing
countries; (6) TFR lying between 4.5
and 6.0; (c) TFR between 3.0 and 4.5;
and (d) TFR less than 3.0, mainly in
the developed countries. Most popula
Social Biology

tions in Phase I have a fertility level
close to that of natural fertility, while
populations in Phase IV have completed most or all of the fertility transition. Relevant estimates of the measures obtained for China can be
compared with those obtained by Bongaarts for those four transition phases
(presented in Table 7). The total fertility rate in China is very close to that
of developed countries (2.62 against
2.06). What the indices of proximate
determinants clearly reveal is the remarkable similarity between China
and the developed countries. The difference in the total fertility rate of
course combines the impact of all immediate fertility variables. The greatest impact on TFR is through contraception accounted for by both
contraceptive effectiveness and proportion currently using contraception.
The rates (u) are 0.61 in China and
0.69 in the developed countries.
Among the four indexes, C, and C,,,
are found to be higher in China than in
developed countries. The index C, is

much lower in China which, according
to our assumption, has a mean postpartum non-susceptible period of about
five months. But in the developed
countries, this period is much shorter
(about three months), and the index
equals 0.93, a factor being of least importance. This index of C, in China is
typical of the pattern prevailing in
semideveloped countries which has a

CONCLUSIONS

We have applied the accounting

‘S$ scheme developed by Bongaarts to es‘= timate the contribution of four principal proximate variables— proportions
«married, contraception, abortion, and
‘= Jactational infecundability—to the fer~ tility level in China during the recent
period of fertility decline. Results iny dicate that the most important inhibiStor of potential fertility is deliberate
control. Its contribution to fertility
= change has been far greater than all
Cother proximate determinants. The
marital structure of the population is
the second most important factor, and
lactational infecundability and induced
abortion are relatively unimportant.
The findings give evidence to the major
role played by the family planning program and the government population
policies; the “late, longer, and few”
policy starting in 1971 and the ‘fone
couple, one child” policy launched in
1979, undoubtedly served as an engine

Fertility Decline in China 25

propelling the fertility transition to a
substantial degree. Such a rapid transition does not seem to have depended
much on the socioeconomic development policies, as is customarily described, since even now the Chinese
population is overwhelmingly rural
and agricultural (Cheng, 1987).

Future prospects for retaining a low
level of fertility are unclear. Whether
the same policies will be more vigorously implemented or relaxed is uncertain. However, the present study at
least points to certain future research
needs and policy implications. First,
since marriage is almost universal in
China, with only few remaining single
throughout the reproductive age span,
and since marital dissolutions as well as
remarriages are uncommon, it would
be unrealistic to expect further lowering in the index of C,,, given that age at
marriage now is relatively high, except
perhaps in some special local circumstances.

Second, breastfeeding also is universally practiced, if not for long duration, especially in rural areas. Since
postpartum infecundability resulting
from breastfeeding has a_fertilityinhibiting effect, natural marital fertility in China is much lower than in the
developed countries. During the last
decade or so, a moderate decline in the
mean duration of breastfeeding has
taken place. Presumably, the decline in
the duration of breastfeeding has operated against the prevailing trends towards lower marital fertility. Thus, lactation as a way of improving child
health and reducing infant mortality
may be promoted to indirectly influence fertility.

iting effect in cities like Shanghai. It is
obvious from the findings in this study
that a goal of further substantial reduction in fertility cannot but consider
abortion as a policy option. Being
aware of the political sensitiveness of
the issue, a cautious recommendation
of conducting further in-depth research on the subject can be offered.
Finally, the most important proximate determinant responsible for the
recent decline in Chinese fertility has
been deliberate marital fertility con

trol. The practice of contraception has
become pervasive during the last decade. However, differentials in contraceptive use between regions (ruralurban) and among educational and
income groups are still large at present.
Public policy should ensure the rapid
spread of knowledge about and access
to contraception, as a means to assure
birth control and especially as an alternative means to obtain the desired
spacing between births.
