legitimate and Premaritally Conceived

First Births in Massachusetts,
1966-1968

While the primary, culturally endorsed
prototype for parenthood in the United
States is one of marriage, followed by conception and birth, recent studies (US.
Bureau of the Census, 1969; U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare,
19682) have shown substantial departure
from this traditional childbearing pattern
and deviations in timing within different
patterns.

Two deviations of the marriage-conception-birth sequence will be considered here:
premaritally conceived births (babies who
were conceived before the marriage of
their biological parents but whose birth
certificate was registered as legitimate, i.e.,
carrying nondiscrepant parent surnames),
and out-of-wedlock births (babies who
were conceived and born outside of marriage and whose birth certificate indicated
no father’s name or discrepant surnames
for mother and father).

Although in all past and present societies, some proportion of marital births
occur soon after marriage and are likely to
have been premaritally conceived (Monahan, 1960), the extent of premarital conception, the societal reaction, and persona]

 

and social consequences of the phenomenon have been noted to be different (Christensen, 1960). Premaritally conceived births
in some countries are very common and
have been interpreted as a component of a
stable and integrated cultural pattern with
few undesirable personal and social sequelae (Christensen, 1960; Croog, 1952),
while in others the phenomenon is less frequent and is thought of as being socially
deviant, necessitating hasty marriages and
increasing the probability of marital dissolution (Christensen, 1960, 1963). Different timing patterns of conception after
marriage and variations in frequency of
premarital conception are generally considered as prime examples of cultural relativism in effect (Christensen, 1960).
Cultural reactions to differential timing
of birth after marriage must be distinguished from the historically dominant attitudes toward out-of-wedlock births. While
most communities are relatively tolerant
about nonmarital conceptions as long as
marriage is forthcoming (Monahan, 1960),
there is little historical evidence that any
society has formally condoned illegitimate
fertility (Davis, 1939; Malinowski, 1930).

Births outside of wedlock have been considered in a variety of cultural contexts.
Illegitimacy has been interpreted as an absolute violation of the universal “principle
of legitimacy” (Malinowski, 1930), a form
of deviant behavior which is always accompanied by penalties for the persons involved. A less severe interpretation of the
phenomenon is one which states that illegitimacy need not always represent
family disorganization or instability but
rather that common-law marriage, matriarchal childrearing, and absorption of children born out-of-wedlock into extended
families may be the “equivalent” of marriage (Roberts, 1966; Rodman, 1963;
Lewis, 1959).

Premaritally conceived and illegitimate
first births have been associated with demographic and personal consequences. A delay in childbearing after marriage has been
related to a rise in the mean age of motherhood and an abatement of the rate of
population growth (Pohlman, 1968; Freedman and Coombs, 1966; Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson, 1966; Coale and Tye,
1961). Conversely, it has been suggested
that an increase in the proportion of births
which occur to young mothers relatively
soon after marriage may negate this effect
and lead to a maintenance or rise of current growth levels (Pohlman, 1968).

From the point of view of the individual
parents, there are data to support the hypothesis that postponement of parenthood
is associated with increased opportunity for
education, capital formation, contro] over
fertility, better marital adjustment and
lower probability of divorce (Coombs et
al., 1970; Pohlman, 1968; Freedman and
Coombs, 1966; Christensen, 1963) and
that nonmaritally conceived fertility (illegitimate and premaritally conceived
births) is related to interrupted education,
decreased financial potential, higher total
fertility, and—should marriage ensue—

Social Biology

greater likelihood of marital dissolution. It
is frequently stated that nonmaritally conceived children, particularly those born
out of wedlock, are more likely than maritally conceived children to be unplanned
and unwanted, have a greater chance of
being born with physical handicaps associated with poor prenatal care, and have
diminished life chances in terms of potential for educational, occupational, and economic advancements because of an unstable
or incomplete family environment (Farley
and Hermalin, 1971; Teele and Schmidt,
1970; Berkov, 1968; Anderson, Masher,
and Richter, 1966; Patker et al., 1961).

CURRENT STATUS OF KNOWLEDGE

National estimates on the annual frequency of illegitimacy, based on data supplied by those states which report statistics
on out-of-wedlock births to the National
Center for Health Statistics (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare,
1968a@), reveal that there has been a
steady increase for both white and nonwhite populations in the absolute number
of illegitimate births, their proportion of
all births, and their number per 1,000 unmarried and total women ages 15-44. One
exception to this general statement is the
slight decline in the latter part of the 1960—
70 decade in the number of nonwhite illegitimate births per 1,000 unmarried
women ages 15-44, Markedly higher agespecific illegitimacy rates and ratios are
evident for nonwhite mothers. The highest
illegitimacy ratios, or the number of illegitimate births per 1,000 total births, are
noted in the maternal age groups under
20, primarily due to the comparatively few
marital births among women in this age
group coupled with the high proportion of
unmarried women “at risk” of an illegitimate birth. The highest illegitimacy rates,
or the number of illegitimate births per

Vol. 19, No. 1

1,000 unmarried or total women, are noted
for women in their twenties.

Data on the frequency of premaritally
conceived births in the United States, as
well as in most other countries, are not as
readily available as illegitimacy statistics
because of the inaccessibility of longitudinal data on the childbearing patterns of
marriage cohorts. With the exception of
vital statistics systems such as that in
Denmark (Goldstein, 1967; Croog, 1952),
there is usually no item on birth certificates relating to the date of marriage of
parents and no simple way to establish the
marriage duration of each year’s births.
American researchers interested in investigating the frequency of premaritally conceived births in the United States have
chosen in the past between (a) large scale
national surveys (U.S. Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare, 1970;
U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969; Whelpton et al., 1966) where marriage and birth
dates are collected through personal interviews or mailed questionnaires, or (6)
small record linkage studies (Siker and
Fritch, 1967; Christensen, 1960, 1963;
Pratt, 1965a) which bring together the
birth certificate of the child and the marriage record of the parents.

Each of the two methodologies for
gathering data on the marriage-to-first
birth interval has limitations. The interview and questionnaire approach has been
shown (Pratt, 1965a) to understate the
frequency of short marriage-birth intervals
because of the tendency of couples who
conceive before marriage to misrepresent
the date of their wedding. Pratt (1965a,5)
compared dates of marriage and first birth
as reported in the Detroit area study interviews with the dates that appeared on
vital records and noted a distinct tendency
for couples who were likely to have conceived before marriage to obscure the true
dates.

Premaritally Conceived First Births

Il

The vital-data linkage technique has the
definite advantage of increasing the accuracy of the interval data. Because of the
time-consuming nature of hand linkage of
vital records, however, this methodology
is generally limited in both its temporal
scope and geographic boundaries. It has
been suggested that the bias introduced by
nonlinkage due to the occurrence of marriage and birth in different locations leads
to a general underestimation of early births
as premarital pregnancy may be associated
with migration, either because of the stigma
attached to it or to socioeconomic factors
related to precipitant marriage and early
parenthood (Goldstein, 1967; Siker, 1967;
Christensen, 1960). No formal analysis of
the type of bias due to nonlinkage has been
presented.

The limited data derived from vitalrecord linkage and survey-based research
document the observation that premaritally conceived first births represent a substantial minority of all legitimate first
births in the United States and suggest
that premaritally conceived births in the
early 1960’s represent a larger portion of
all legitimate first births than they did in
the previous three decades. To date little
effort has been made, however, to (a) provide vital-data—based statistics on a national or local level on the frequency and
characteristics of premaritally conceived
births in the latter part of the 1960-70
decade and (6) investigate the complementary relationship of the two components of nonmaritally conceived fertility
and the effect of differential likelihood of
marriage following out-of-wedlock conception on the frequency of illegitimacy.

of knowledge in both subject areas stimulated this investigation into nonmaritally
conceived first births in Massachusetts,
1966-68.

Specific research goals were set forth:

1. Presentation of vital-data—based statistics on the frequency of (a) premaritally
conceived births and (0) illegitimate first
births to Massachusetts couples in the
1966-68 period.

2. Analysis of variation in frequency and
timing of premaritally conceived first
births in relation to the date of marriage
by maternal age, race, residence, occupational status, and the type of wedding
ceremony.

3. An evaluation of the type of bias introduced into a vital-data record linkage
study by the occurrence of marriage
and birth in different locations.

4, Examination of the complementary relationship of premaritally conceived and
out-of-wedlock first births.

The statistical data presented here refer
only to births to residents of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the three-year
span under study. However, we hope this
information will contribute to the general
knowledge of the frequency and characteristics associated with illegitimate and
premaritally conceived first births, the
methodology used to study these phenomena, and the complementary relationships

 

between the two components of nonmaritally conceived fertility.

As is seen in Figure 1, there are two
sources of natality and marriage data in
Massachusetts: the Office of the Secretary
of State and the Department of Public
Health. Materials from both sources were
used in the present study.

Massachusetts is one of the ten states
which does not include the legitimacy status
of the child or the marital status of the
mother on the birth certificate and does
not report data on out-of-wedlock births to
the National Center for Health Statistics.1
Certificates of Massachusetts births, presumed to be illegitimate because of the absence of a father’s name or a discrepancy
between the surname of the mother and the
father, are bound separately as restricted
records in the Office of the Secretary of
State. The restricted records of the 1966
to 1968 period were examined and a systematic sample of the presumed illegitimate
births to Massachusetts resident mothers
was drawn. Twenty per cent of births to
white mothers age 15 and over and 40%

Statistics on the annual frequency of births out of
wedlock. In the immediately preceding years there
were 16 states not reporting data.

of births to nonwhite mothers age 15 and
over were included in the sample for each
year. All certificates indicating a maternal
age of under 15 at delivery were included
(Whelan, 1971 a, 5). The maternal age and
race were abstracted from each certificate.
A mother was considered to be nonwhite
if her color was described on her child’s
birth certificate as Negro, black, yellow, or
Indian. It was not possible to include birth
order as a study variable as this item was
not completed on the certificate of about
half of the births occurring in 1966-68.
For the same three years, an age-race
stratified, systematic sample of legitimate
first births to Massachusetts residents was
drawn. A computer program selected the
sample from a magnetic tape which carried
the relevant statistical information on all
Massachusetts births occurring in these
years (see Table 1). Age and race stratification was used for two reasons. First, the
population of Massachusetts is less than
3% nonwhite and in order to assure an
adequate sample size for this portion of the
population, it was necessary to oversample
this racial group. Second, premaritally conceived first births have been reported to be
associated with young maternal age (Siker,
1967; Pratt, 1965 a, 6). In order to assure
numbers amenable to detailed analysis of
this phenomenon, mothers under age 19

were oversampled. The small number of
1966~68 first babies for whom no race or
age data were indicated were excluded. The
age-race specific sampling proportions are
described in Table 2.?

It was necessary to remove from the sample 45 births which occurred out of state
and were coded in such a way that no
linkage could be made to a birth certificate,
24 births which were illegitimate and were
included because of coding errors in the
preparation of the magnetic birth tape, and
1,182 births which were subsequently discovered to be of higher than first order.
The inclusion of higher-order births in the
initial sample resulted because of the Office
of Health Research practice of coding
all birth certificates which were blank with
regard to parity as first births, a system
which overstated the frequency of first
births in the Commonwealth. All sample
birth certificates which had no definite birth
order were traced to the hospital of delivery where parity information was abstracted
from the maternity record. Births of higher
than first order were dropped. The final
sample consisted of 2,927 white and 772

Assuming that the proportion of ‘‘ineligible” births in the sample (illegitimate, out
of state occurrence, and higher order) was
the same in age and race subgroups in the
total births reported as legitimate first
births (Table 1), the final sample represents the true universe of first births in the
original proportions. Table 2 presents both
the final sample and the total estimated frequency of legitimate first births occurring
in Massachusetts to Massachusetts residents, 1966-68.

The parents’ names were linked with the
data processing card for each first birth
and a search was made of the Massachusetts marriage indices for the ten years
prior to and one year after the birth.? To
increase the overall number of births
matched with marriage records and to
evaluate the bias introduced by nonmatch
due to out-of-state marriages, the search
for marriage records was extended to
Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and
New York (excluding New York City).

RESULTS
ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS

Weighting the number of illegitimate
births in the sample by the age-race specific
sampling proportions, estimates were made
of the total presumed out-of-wedlock births
occurring in 1966-68 to Massachusetts residents. Table 3 summarizes the findings
and relates the frequency of out-of-wedlock births to all Massachusetts resident
live births (illegitimacy ratio).

Since a high proportion of the 1966—68
Massachusetts birth certificates had no indication of the parity status of the mother,*
it was necessary to estimate the number
of first-order illegitimate births by assuming that the distribution by birth order of
out-of-wedlock births to Massachusetts
residents in each maternal age and race
group was the same as the maternal-age

4 Although a birth-order item was added to
the Massachusetts birth certificate in 1964, a
high rate of nonresponse was noted until 1970.

were those births occurring to mothers of
older maternal ages (p < 0.001).5 Ninetyfour per cent of the marriages found were
first marriages for both the bride and the
groom.

A legitimate first child whose birth preceded the marriage of his parents was considered to be premaritally conceived.®
Births occurring within marriage durations
of less than 196 days were also designated
as having been conceived prior to the wedding since survival in such a short gestational period is rare (Millen, 1962).
Identification of premaritally conceived
births of over 195 days marriage duration
was considerably more difficult and led to
the development of two definitions of the
temporal demarcation between premaritally conceived births and births not premaritally conceived and to the use of a
birth weight-gestational age gradient to
identify those babies born after 195 days
marriage duration who were very likely to
have been conceived before the wedding of
their parents.

In relating marriage duration and gestational period,’ the earliest possible date of
marital impregnation, conception on the
wedding day, was utilized, and an arbitrary
14 days between the first day of the last
menstrual period and the conception date
was employed. A maritally conceived birth
that was the result of an impregnation on
the wedding day and had an average gestation of 280 days (Eastman and Hellman,

5In determining statistically significant differences, chi-square goodness of fit tests on the distributions between marriage and birth were
performed, using 0.05 as the level of significance.
Chi-square tests on the differences in proportions
of births premaritally conceived were performed
employing the same significance level and using
Yates correction factor where necessary.

6A small number of legitimate first births,
although they were registered with a nondiscrepant parent’s name on the birth certificate, were
discovered to have preceded the parent’s marriage.

1966) would be born 266 days after the
marriage.

Although 280 days is considered to be
the average length of gestation, approximately 46.5% of United States babies
born in 1968 had less than this gestational
period, and 10% were born before completing 266 days of gestation (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare,
1968b). This variability in the duration
of pregnancy led to the development of
two definitions of the temporal demarcations of premaritally conceived first births.
Under Definition 1, births occurring 266
days or more after marriage (comparable
to 280 days of gestation) were defined as
not premaritally conceived; under Definition 2, births occurring 252 days or more
after marriage (comparable to 266 days of
gestation) were defined as not premaritally
conceived.

A birth weight—gestational age gradient,®
which was specific to the race of the mother
and the sex of the child, was used to identify the premaritally conceived babies born
within 196 and 265 days of marriage (under Definition 1) or between 196 and 251
days of marriage (under Definition 2). The
birth weights at both the 75th and 90th
percentiles of the birth weight—gestational
age gradient for individual weeks of gestation were compared with those of babies
born in marriage durations included under
each definition. Babies whose weights were
above the 75th or 90th percentile weight
at the gestational age comparable to their
parents’ marriage duration were considered
to be premaritally conceived. The four
estimates of the percentage of sample legitimate first births premaritally conceived
(PMC) are presented in Table 5. Between
24.0% and 26.8% of sample white legiti

white and 9,800 indigent Negro deliveries (195965) at Grady Memorial Hospital (Freedman et

mate first births and between 38.7% and
42.2% of the nonwhite legitimate first
births occurring in 1966-68 in Massachusetts to Massachusetts residents were very
likely to have been conceived prior to the
marriage of their parents.

It is not possible to be sure about the
premarital conception of each individual
baby. Any estimate of the proportion of
legitimate first births premaritally conceived is likely to include erroneously some
maritally conceived births in the premarital
conception category and exclude from the
premaritally conceived group a number of
babies who were actually conceived prior to
the wedding of their parents. In an effort

DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF

MARRIAGE

Maternal age and race——Table 6 presents estimates, by maternal age and race
of the child, of the percentage of sample
legitimate first births premaritally conceived and the mean interval (in days)
between marriage and the birth of the child.
For both whites and nonwhites, there is a
significant difference among maternal age
groups (~#< 0.001) in the proportion of
legitimate first births which were conceived
premaritally. As maternal age increased,
the proportion decreased.

When legitimate first births were compared within specific maternal age groups,
nonwhite babies born to mothers ages 2024 showed a significantly higher proportion
premaritally conceived than did white
babies to mothers of the comparable age

NONMARITALLY CONCEIVED
FIRST BIRTHS

Relationship of premaritally conceived
and illegitimate first births—Table 11
shows that 30.6% of white and 63.9% of
nonwhite first births occurring in 1966-68
were nonmaritally conceived, and were
born outside of, before, or within 252 days
of marriage. Some 71.7% of white and
33.3% of nonwhite nonmaritally conceived
first births were legitimated by marriage

prior to their birth.

DISCUSSION

The systematic stratified samples of outof-wedlock births and legitimate first births

occurring 1966-68 to Massachusetts residents were selected in a manner designed to
afford unbiased estimates of the extent of
illegitimate and premaritally conceived
legitimate first births. It is acknowledged,
however, that unknown sampling biases
may undermine the representativeness of
the sample. Furthermore, there are two
factors which may affect the internal
validity of the samples: (1) The out-ofwedlock births studied did not include
illegitimate births occurring out of state
to Massachusetts residents, as no record of
these events is filed in the restricted records of the Massachusetts Secretary of
State. This exclusion may understate the
frequency of illegitimate births to Massachusetts residents. (2) The 16.8% of white
and 32.1% of nonwhite legitimate first
births which were not linked with parents’
marriage records may tend to underestimate the proportion of legitimate first
births occurring before or very shortly
after marriage. The unmatched births could
be a product of a marriage which occurred
in a state other than Massachusetts or the
seven Northeast states where research was
conducted. The data in Table 7 suggest
that the direction of the bias introduced

 
 

De ceraber 2015

Vol. 19, No. 1

by out-of-state marriage is toward understatement of PMC births. There is also the
possibility that the parents of babies for
whom no linkage with a marriage record
was made were actually never married, and
the mother falsified her child’s birth certificate.

Data on the frequency of illegitimacy
among first-order births collected in the
current study are similar to that presented
elsewhere (U.S. Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare, 1968a; Berkov,
1968). It is difficult to compare the Massachusetts data on PMC legitimate first births
with previously published data on the sub© ject because of different methodologies and
definitions of premarital pregnancy employed in the study of premarital conception. A number of earlier studies (Pratt,
1965a; Christensen, 1960, 1963a), for instance, estimated the proportion of brides
in first marriages who were pregnant at or
before their marriage. Since these estimates
using marriage cohorts as denominators
would include infertile as well as fertile
couples and include births originally registered as illegitimate and subsequently
legitimated by marriage of their natural
parents, they cannot be compared to the
estimates of the proportion of legitimate
first births which were conceived prior to
the marriage of the parents.

The results of two studies are compar© able to these Massachusetts data: (1) the
estimates made through record-linkage
techniques of PMC first births to Connecticut teenage mothers (Siker, 1967) are
very similar to the present estimates; (2)
data from the National Natality Survey
(U.S. Department of Health, Education
and Welfare, 1970), gathered through
questionnaires mailed to some 3,000 women
having legitimate first births in the United
States between 1964 and 1966, indicate

that 19.5% of white births and 41.6% of

Premaritally Conceived First Births

23

nonwhite births were premaritally conceived (occurred within eight months or
less of marriage duration). When the comparable definition of premarital conception
is employed, 26.4% of white and 42.4% of
nonwhite Massachusetts legitimate first
births were conceived prior to the marriage
of their parents. The greater proportion of
premarital conception among Massachusetts first births may be related to a real
difference in frequency of PMC births in
the two populations or may be a result of
the different methodologies employed. Since
it has been demonstrated previously (Pratt,
1965a) that the survey method of gathering
marriage and birth dates tends to understate the frequency of short marriage-birth
intervals because of the tendency of couples
who conceive before marriage to misrepresent the date of their wedding, it is likely
that differences between Massachusetts and
United States estimates are primarily due
to the greater capability of record-linkage
techniques in identifying PMC births.

ILLEGITIMATE FIRST BIRTHS
(CONCEPTION—BIRTH—MARRIAGE
OR NO MARRIAGE)

White and nonwhite women of maternal
ages under 20 demonstrated a higher than
usual frequency of illegitimate births, as
measured by the illegitimacy ratio (Table
3) and the first-order illegitimacy ratio
(Table 4). The discrepancies between age
groups is partly due to the fact that the
illegitimacy ratio in a given age group is
not only a function of the number of illegitimate births (numerator) but also of those
factors affecting the denominator: the
number of women of childbearing age, the
proportion of women married, and the level
of marital and nonmarital fertility. Illegitimacy ratios are higher among teenagers
because there are comparatively few marital births among women in this age group

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:32 08 December 2015

24. Whelan

while there is a high proportion of unmarried women “at risk” of an illegitimate
pregnancy. When comparing illegitimacy
rates, which relate the number of illegitimate births to the unmarried female population, Massachusetts women of both races
age 20-29 demonstrate a higher rate of
births out of wedlock than do women under
age 20 (Whelan, 1971a).

At each maternal age a higher proportion
of all births and estimated first births to
nonwhite women, as compared with white
women, were shown to be out of wedlock
(Tables 4 and 5). The racial discrepancy
in frequency of illegitimacy has been analyzed at each of the steps which preceded
an out-of-wedlock birth: the probability of
the intercourse, the likelihood of conception, and the nature of resolution of the
nonmarital pregnancy (Zelnik and Kantner, 1970). Although there are no empirical
data on the differences in frequency of
premarital intercourse among white and
nonwhite women, or on birth control usage
among unmarrieds, recent small-scale interview studies have suggested that a black
female is more likely than her white
counterpart to engage in premarital intercourse and less likely to employ contraception (Zelnik and Kantner, 1970).
Further, it has been suggested that after
the occurrence of an out-of-wedlock conception, nonwhites are less likely to resort
to abortion or marriage as a means of terminating or legitimating a pregnancy (Cutright, 1971; Zelnik and Kantner, 1970;
Pratt, 1965a). Nonwhites may be more
prone than whites to reject abortion as an
alternative for coping with an illegitimately
conceived pregnancy because of cultural,
religious, or economic factors, or a combination thereof (Zelnik and Kantner, 1970).
The differential use of marriage by whites
and nonwhites as a means of coping with
an illegitimate conception and its effects

Social Biology

on racial differences in frequency of illegitimacy will be discussed in the next section.

PREMARITALLY CONCEIVED LEGITIMATE
FIRST BIRTHS (CONCEPTION—
MARRIAGE—BIRTH )

Births of before 196 days of marriage,
and those in the 196-251 days marriageduration range with weights higher than
would be expected at that gestational age,
were designated as premaritally conceived.
This definition is conservative compared to
those used in previous investigations (Siker,
1967; Pratt, 1965 a, 6; Christensen, 1960,
1963). It was felt that births of over 251
days marriage duration, although a number
may have been premaritally conceived,
were of less social and demographic interest as they were less likely to have precipitated a marriage, but rather to have
preceded an already scheduled wedding.
Even the most liberal of the four definitions
in Table 5, however, very probably understates the actual frequency of premaritally
conceived first births in the sample.

A nonmarital conception which terminates in live birth may either be (a) born
outside of marriage as an illegitimate child
or be (5) born in wedlock as a legitimate
baby. The illegitimacy ratio is in part a
function of the marriage behavior of pregnant unmarried women. As is evident in
Table 11, the majority (72%) of mothers
of white nonmaritally conceived first births
resolve the illegitimate conception by marriage prior to the birth. This is not true
for nonwhite births: one-third of nonwhite
nonmaritally conceived first births occur
within wedlock. The diminished tendency
of nonwhites to marry after an out-of-wedlock conception contributes substantially
to the higher illegitimacy ratios of this
group. As shown in Table 11, while illegitimate first-birth ratios (the number of
first-order illegitimate births per 1,000 total
Vol. 19, No. 1

first-order births) are approximately five
times higher for nonwhites, the total PMC
first-birth ratios (the number of legitimate
first births per 1,000 total first births) are
almost identical for whites and nonwhites.
The factor of difference between the racial
groups is reduced to two when the total
nonmaritally conceived first-birth ratios are
compared. The less frequent use of marriage
by nonwhites as a means of legitimating an
out-of-wedlock pregnancy has been related
= to a cultural pattern in the Negro com“\ munity where conception and childbearing
outside of marriage are tolerated (Zelnik
5 and Kantner, 1970). Data reported elseA where suggest that Massachusetts nonwhite
co mothers often postpone their mariage to
a the father of the child, or to someone else,
cs until after the birth and that a substantial
= portion of nonwhite births registered as
sillegitimate may subsequently be legitiSomated (Whelan, 19713).

For both white and nonwhite women
there was an indirect association of prearitally conceived births and maternal
ge. For a teenager, pregnancy may be the
rimary underlying cause of marriage, while
for older women there are factors other
— than the desire to legitimate an out-of-wed© lock conception which precipitate marriage.
© Diminished access to contraceptives and
& abortion among teenagers may contribute
E to their higher proportion of first legitimate
4 births premaritally conceived.

The high proportion of PMC births to
Massachusetts parents married in a civil
as opposed to religious ceremony and the
shorter interval between the civil wedding
and the birth of a premaritally conceived
child are compatible with the results of
other research (Pratt, 19655; Christensen,
1960). These differences are related to a
number of factors: (a) a marriage precipitated by pregnancy is less likely to be
associated with an elaborate church wed

ding; (5) couples who are married by a
Justice of the Peace may be less likely to
accept formal religious doctrine and codes
that proscribe premarital sexual liaisons;
(¢) the type of marriage ceremony may
reflect differences in socioeconomic status
and different attitudes about the temporal
relationship of marriage, conception, and
birth. The elimination of the previously
noted significant difference (Table 6) between white and nonwhite births to women
ages 20-24 in the proportion premaritally
conceived when racial comparison was
limited to couples married in a Catholic
ceremony (Table 8) is best explained by
(c).

The proportion of PMC births to mothers
whose occupation was indicated as “at
home” at the time of the wedding was
significantly higher than the comparable
proportion of births to employed brides
(Table 9). It is not possible to know if the
bride’s status was “at home” because her
pregnancy caused her to leave a job or if a
bride who has never worked, because of
various social and economic factors, is more
likely than an employed bride to conceive
before marriage. Although no significant
differences were evident in the proportion
of legitimate PMC first births between
white and blue collar brides and grooms,
it was noted that blue collar workers have
a shorter interval between marriage and
the birth of a premaritally conceived child,
an observation which suggests that low
socioeconomic couples are under less social
pressure to marry immediately after the
discovery of the conception.

It is difficult to analyze the association
of premaritally conceived births and social
variables, such as type of wedding ceremony or occupational status of the bride
and groom, without considering the relative
role of out-of-wedlock births in each subgroup. When white and nonwhite subgroups

were compared with respect to the proportion of legitimate first births premaritally
conceived, there were relatively small differences; yet, the differences manifest between the races in the other component of
nonmarital conception, illegitimate births,
were striking. It is possible that there would
be a substantial difference in the proportion
of nonmaritally conceived births by religion, occupation, and other socioeconomic
variables if detailed data on illegitimate
births were also available.

CONCLUSIONS

The data derived from the current study
of nonmaritally conceived first births in
Massachusetts have expanded the current
knowledge on the subject by (1) allowing
a basis for evaluating potential bias introduced into a birth-marriage record linkage
study by the occurrence of the two vital
events in different locations; (2) providing
for one locality recent vital-record—based
information on the extent of illegitimacy
and premaritally conceived first births, (3)
reexamining the previously noted differences in the frequency and timing of PMC
first births among sociodemographic subgroups and (4) presenting simultaneously
data on both components of nonmaritally
conceived first births.

The results of the current investigation
suggest that vital data linkage methodologies which are limited to one geographic
area do not necessarily result in underestimation of the extent of PMC births. Massachusetts parents married outside of the
Commonwealth in one of the seven states
where record searching was done did not
demonstrate a significantly greater proportion of PMC births. It is still possible,
however, that other underlying causes of
nonlinkage—for example, the possibility
that marriage never actually took place or

 

 

Social Biology

occurred a great distance away from Massachusetts—do contribute to underestimation of PMC births.

A substantial minority of white first
births and the majority of nonwhite first
births occurring in Massachusetts to Massachusetts residents in the 1966-68 period
were born outside of marriage or conceived
before the marriage of their parents. The
differential extent of premaritally conceived births by maternal age, race, occupational status of the parents, and type of
wedding ceremony confirm the findings of
previous investigations.

The potential personal and social implications of shifts in the temporal relationship of marriage, conception, and birth
suggest that an ongoing system monitoring
changes in the frequency of illegitimacy
and premaritally conceived births be encouraged. Massachusetts and other states
with the capability for such research should
make the attempt to gather data on illegitimacy and the marriage-birth interval on a
regular basis. Hand linkage of records is
very time consuming and would preclude
annual large scale studies of this type. Two
alternative means of collecting data on the
marriage to first-birth interval should be
considered: (1) methodologies of computer
linkage, whereby a sample of birth and
marriage records could be brought together,
either through a mutual identification number or through a Soundex system which
would link names of parents on the data
processing card of the birth with the names
of brides and grooms on the data processing
card of the marriage. Once linkage was
made, surnames could be dropped from the
pooled record to ensure confidentiality; (2)
an item on marriage data of the parents
could be included on the confidential section
of the birth certificate; these dates could be
used in conjunction with record linkage
techniques.

SUMMARY

The potential social and personal consequences of shifts in frequency of illegitimate and premaritally conceived births and
the general dearth of information on these
subjects prompted this investigation of the
frequency and characteristics of nonmaritally conceived first births to Massachusetts women in the 1966-68 period. Data
were gathered through examination of a
sample of birth certificates of illegitimate
children and through linkage of certificates
of birth of a sample of legitimate first
children with the marriage records of their
parents. The search for marriage records
to associate with the Massachusetts first
births was conducted in Massachusetts and
seven nearby states. Some 83% of white
and 68% of nonwhite legitimate first births
were linked with the marriage record of
their parents.

While the modal pattern of family formation for the white population in Massachusetts is one where first conception and birth
follow marriage, there is substantial departure from this traditional sequence and
deviations in timing of events within the
three temporal patterns of marriage, conception, and birth. For the nonwhite population, the predominant pattern is one
where first conception and birth precede
or occur outside of marriage.

Premaritally Conceived First Births

27

Higher-than-average illegitimacy ratios
were observed for nonwhite women and
white women under age 20. When all nonmaritally conceived first births (illegitimate
and premaritally conceived) were considered, the racial differences were diminished.

Babies of both races born to women
married in a civil ceremony and babies of
both races born to mothers who were not
employed at the time of their wedding
were more likely to be premaritally conceived than were first babies of women
married in a religious ceremony and first
babies of women who were employed at
the time of marriage.
