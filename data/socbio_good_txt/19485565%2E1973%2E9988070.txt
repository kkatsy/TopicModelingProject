Socioeconomic and Reproductive
Characteristics of the Parents of Patients

with the G,-trisomy Syndrome

Although meiotic nondisjunction, resulting in offspring with numerical chromosomal abnormalities, occurs without satisfactory explanation, accumulating evidence
suggests the influence of several different
factors. Perhaps more positive and less
negative evidence implicates maternal autoimmune disease, specifically of the thyroid, than exists for the other possibilities
(Fialkow et al., 1971). The role of irradiation is controversial, there being data
supporting (Sigler et al., 1965; Uchida
et al., 1968) and denying its effect (Carter
et al., 1961; Schull and Neel, 1962). The
incidence of one specific viral disease, infectious hepatitis, has been related to the
occurrence of the G,-trisomy’ syndrome in
Australia (Stoller and Collmann, 1965;
Collmann et al., 1966), but studies in
England (Leck, 1966), the United States
(Stark and Mantel, 1967), and Canada
(Baird and Miller, 1968) were not confirmative, and the role of this specific virus
remains speculative. Though an association
of maternal age with the G-trisomy syndrome has long been recognized, a testable
explanation relating sexual behavior to

delayed fertilization was only recently
proposed (German, 1968). Subsequent
analyses favored (Shokeir, 1968) and disputed (Penrose and Berg, 1968; Cannings
and Cannings, 1968) this hypothesis.

We summarize our understanding of the
etiology of meiotic nondisjunction as follows. First, no single factor, regardless of
its importance, appears universally contributory. Second, no visible cause operates even in a majority of cases. Third, no
mechanism seems to be absolutely causative in any particular case, excluding the
families with an inherited translocation.
Rather, it seems now that meiotic nondisjunction results from a combination of
factors, each possibly exerting a variable
influence from one person to the next.
Essentially, given a particular genotype
and either sex at a certain age, meiotic
nondisjunction results because of the accumulation of variable environmental
agencies. The problem in predicting this
event is that we cannot currently recognize
in whom, at what time, and in which circumstances it will occur. Ultimately, of
course, prediction is the object of our
understanding.

Before conceiving the studies we will
describe, we postulated the existence of
living patterns due to socioeconomic or
educational similarities of families which
might lead to the recognition of other
causative factors in meiotic nondisjunction. The purpose of our report is to
present the results of a survey of some
socioeconomic and educational characteristics as well as various measures of reproductive performance in the parents of 80
patients with the G-trisomy syndrome.

MATERIALS

We ascertained the patients from three
sources: first, from our Cytogenetics Laboratory in the West Virginia University
Hospital between 1 July 1965 and 30
December 1968; second, from the clinics
of West Virginia University Hospital between its opening in 1961 and the establishment of the Cytogenetics Laboratory,
after which all patients suspected of the
diagnosis were referred to it;* third, from
a state institution, specifically, the Colin
Anderson Center, St. Marys, West Virginia, where, after obtaining a list of all
patients with the diagnosis of G,-trisomy
syndrome, we examined them individually
(and also cytogenetically evaluated those
in whom we had some reason to question
the diagnosis).

All patients survived the neonatal period. The mean age of the 39 males alive
at the time of our study was 11.50 years
with a range of 2.14 to 35.14 years, and
the mean age of the 38 living females was
9.64 years with a range of 0.38 to 31.73
years. The three deceased patients were a
male who died at 0.10 years, a male who
died at 0.48 years, and a female who died
at 0.10 years. The year of birth of the
patients ranged from 1933 to 1968, with

these sources.

a mean of 1958, median of 1960, and
modes of 1962 and 1963. All patients were
Caucasian.

METHODS

After designing the questionnaire, we
included it with a letter of introduction
and explanation to the parents at their
most recent address, except for the last
three patients who were ascertained in
the Cytogenetics Laboratory and _ for
whom the questionnaire was completed at
the time of referral. The questionnaire
purposefully asked for more answers than
we intended to analyze. We included several questions about growth and development of the G-trisomic and about the environment, because we wished to avoid
focusing the respondents’ attention to our
specific concerns. When necessary to verify
a diagnosis in a relative, we wrote supplemental inquiries, particularly to confirm
the occurrence of leukemia among the ancestors of G-trisomics.

From the clinical records of West Virginia University Hospital and from the
records of its Cytogenetics Laboratory we
began with 60 patients. We were unable to
contact the parents of 2, we received no
response from the parents of 7, and the
parents of 1 refused to cooperate, so that
50 of the total of 80 patients came from
these sources. We began at the Colin Anderson Center with the names of 48 patients. We could not contact the parents
of 5, we received no response to our inquiry from 9, and we had 1 incomplete
response. In addition, we eliminated 3
patients who were incorrectly diagnosed.
We dismissed 1 of them by physical examination and the other 2 by cytogenetic
evaluation, 1 having a normal karyotype
and the other mosaicism, 46,XX/47,XX,
-+-G. Thus, 30 of the 80 patients came
from this source. By eliminating those
parents we could not contact, presumably

406

because of incorrect address, and also subtracting the patients whom we showed not
to have the syndrome, we estimated the
response to be 82%, or 80 out of 98.

We found either the parents, surviving
or divorced parent, or closest relative of
71 of the 80 patients at addresses in West
Virginia, specifically, in 27 of the state’s
55 counties, a majority residing in northwestern and central western counties. The
respondents for seven of the remaining
nine patients lived in the neighboring
states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland,
and Virginia; two had relocated to Texas
and the Virgin Islands.

We confirmed the diagnosis cytogenetically in 35 of the 80 patients. Excepting 1
patient with the karyotype of 46,XY,-D,
+t(DqGq), all patients had 47 chromosomes; none revealed evidence of mosaicism.

RESULTS
REPRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE

The 80 couples reported a total of 361
pregnancies with a range of 1 to 14 per
couple; the mean number of pregnancies
per couple was 4.5. They listed 25 pregnancies lost by abortion or previable birth
which gives a rate of 7%. Though we
specifically asked for records of each pregnancy, we consider this figure unreliable
because we conducted the study by mailed
questionnaire, because of anamnestic failure by older respondents, and because
every reply was not completed by the
mother. The couples also reported eight
stillbirths. Thus, they had produced a
mean of 4.1 livebirths.

At the time of the study, the mean age
of the 76 living mothers was 40.30 years
with a range of 22.98 to 70.63 years.
Actually, 24 of the 76 living mothers were
45 years or more, which means we may
estimate that at least 32% of the sibships
were completed. Likewise, at the time of
the study the mean age of the 74 living

fathers for whom we obtained information
was 43.08 years with a range of 23.36 to
68.21 years.

One couple had two offspring with Gtrisomy in five pregnancies; the proposita
in our study was the result of the third
pregnancy, born at a maternal age of 20.4
years, and the other affected child was the
result of the fifth pregnancy at a maternal
age of 24.8 years.

BIRTH ORDER

Table 1 presents the birth order of the
G-trisomics by sibship size for 79 of the
80 propositi about whom we obtained data.
We found the expected effect of maternal
age and birth order using the test described by Haldane and Smith (1948);
specifically, the sum of the birth ranks of
affected siblings was 1,644, and the theoretical mean sum of the birth ranks of
affected siblings was 1,218, with standard
deviation of the theoretical mean of 71.5.

SEX RATIO

Table 2 listing the sex ratio shows that
it is the normal 1.05 for the total offspring,
for the siblings of the G-trisomics, and
also for the G-trisomics. The sex ratio of
neither the siblings born before the Gtrisomics nor of those born after them is
significantly divergent from 1.05 (chi
square = 0.08, degree of freedom [d.f.]
= 1 for before and chi square = 0.29, d.f.
= 1 for after).

PARENTAL AGE BY SEX OF G-TRISOMIC

Table 3 indicates that the mean maternal
age at the birth of the females with Gtrisomy was slightly greater than for the
males, but this difference was not significant (p> 0.50). In contrast, the same
table reveals that the mean paternal age
at the birth of the females with the syndrome was somewhat less than for males;
however, this difference also was not significant by the ¢ test (0.50 > p > 0.25).

CONSANGUINITY

None of the 80 couples reported that
they were related to each other except by
marriage. The paternal grandparents of
one patient were related as first cousins;
this cannot be used as an estimate of ancestral consanguinity, however, since our
question asked only about the parental
relationships.

TWINS

The 80 couples reported a total of 336
pregnancies, each resulting in at least one
livebirth; there were 5 twin pregnancies,
which is 1 multiple in 67 pregnancies or
approximately 1.5%. Four of the five twin
pregnancies were presumably dizygotic.

Each of two twin pregnancies resulted in a

pregnancy resulted in males not surviving
the neonatal period.

BIRTH INTERVALS

Table'4 discloses the results of our
analysis of the interval between births in
the sibships with at least two members.
Since we did not obtain the date of marriage of the parents, we could not compute
the interval from the beginning of cohabitation to the termination of the first live
birth. We compared the interval preceding
the birth of the G-trisomics with that
preceding the birth of all their siblings,

and we also subdivided the G-trisomics and
their siblings according to terminal and
nonterminal births in their sibships, although we recognized that approximately
two-thirds of the families theoretically
were not completed. We employed Student’s ¢ test for all comparisons.

The interval from a prior birth to that
for all G-trisomics, 4.18 years, was significantly different from the interval before all
normal siblings, 2.83 years (p < 0.005);
and, likewise, the intervals prior to the
birth of both the female G-trisomics (0.05
> p> 0.025) and the male G-trisomics
(P <.0.005) were significantly different
from the interval preceding the normals;
the difference in intervals preceding the
male and the female G-trisomics was not
significant.

When we considered the intervals preceding only terminal births, we found similar results. The difference in the intervals
preceding all G-trisomics and the normal
siblings was significant (p < 0.005), and
there were significantly different intervals
between the normal siblings and the female G-trisomics (p< 0.005), and the
male G-trisomics (p < 0.005) considered
separately. Again the difference in the intervals before the birth of female G-trisomics versus male G-trisomics was not
significant (p > 0.50). The significant difference in birth intervals before G-triso
mics compared with their normal siblings
arises from the difference in intervals when
they are each terminal births. This is apparent from our showing that the intervals
of nonterminal births were not different,
that is, before all G-trisomics and the normal siblings (0.25 >> 0.10), before
female G-trisomics and the normal siblings
(0.25 > p>0.10), and prior to male
G-trisomics and the normal siblings (p >
0.50); in addition, the intervals preceding
the female G-trisomics and the male Gtrisomics were not different (0.10 > p>
0.05).

PARENTAL EDUCATION

We grouped grades and years of education into three-year categories through
high school and into two four-year categories beyond high school, our data indicating the exact level achieved. The highest
scholastic level attained by the parents,
listing first the father and second the
mother follows: elementary (altogether
4-6 years of education) 4 and 2, junior
high (7-9 years) 15 and 19, senior high
(10-12 years) 43 and 45, college (13-16
years) 11 and 12, professional and graduate (17-20 years) 4 and 1, and no information, 3 and 1, for totals of 80. The
mean grade level for the 77 fathers was
11.4 and for the 79 mothers was 11.1
years.

Vol. 20, No. 4

For comparison with the general population of West Virginia, we turned to unpublished data of the State of West Virginia supplied through the Bureau of Vital
Statistics, which were actually prepared
for the Governor’s Commission on Mental
Retardation as a Task Force Report, 1965.
These data categorized the population of
each of the 55 counties in West Virginia
numerous ways, among which we used the
following for this and a subsequent comparison: (1) 1960 population, (2) median
school years completed for those over 25
years, and (3) per capita income. When
these data were obtained during the 1960
census, the mean age of the mothers of
our patients was somewhat more than 32
years and the mean age of the fathers was
just 35 years. At these ages, then, the parents were younger than the majority of
those over 25 years and thus might be expected to have more years of education
than the general population, whether indicated by median or mean.

Our procedure to obtain the population
for comparison was: (1) listing the 27
counties in which the parents of the patients resided; (2) listing the population
of each of the 27 counties and then computing it as a proportion of the total population of the 27 counties (using 1,226,960
as the denominator in contrast to the total
population in the state of 1,860,421); (3)
listing the median school years completed
by the population of each county and then
multiplying this by the county’s proportion of the total population previously calculated; and (4) summing the 27 values.
For example, county H’s population of
77,856 was 0.0634 of the total 1,226,960
persons; 0.0634 times 9.9, the median
school years completed by residents of
county H, gave 0.63, its contribution to
the sum of the mean school years completed by residents of the 27 counties.
The result of this procedure was to com
Parental Factors in G, Trisomy

409

pare the educational attainment of the parents of the patients with that of the population in their counties of residence, with
weighting by the proportionate representation of that county to the total population.
The result was 10.0 years. Thus, the parents of the G-trisomics appear to have
about one more year of education.

PARENTAL INCOME

We can only assume that the reported
income is as reliable as the other data. In
our request to the parents we assured them
of the confidentiality of their individual
responses; in addition, questions concerning both income and education were listed
together on a page in the middle of the
questionnaire. The annual income listed by
the parents, including that of the mother
as well as that of the father, follows: 5
families with less than $2,000, 19 from
$2,001 to $5,000, 36 from $5,001 to
$10,000, 3 from $10,001 to $15,000, 9
with more than $15,001 and 8 supplied no
information, for a total of 80.

We estimated the per capita income by:
(1) counting the number of persons at
home, including those more than 18 years
old when their occupation was given as
student and when they were unmarried but
excluding those more than 18 years who
were listed as employed, and including the
patients with G-trisomy, regardless of
whether in the institution and regardless
of age; (2) using the exact figure for
annual income when available; (3) taking
$2,000 as the income when less than $2,000
was indicated and taking $15,000 as the
figure when more than $15,001 was
checked, a procedure which probably underestimated the actual income because
nearly twice as many parents together
gave more than $15,001 as did less than
$2,000; (4) utilizing the midpoint of the
other three ranges since we asked for and
generally received a check mark indicating
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

410 Juberg, Goshen, and Sholte

the appropriate range of income; that is,
we used $3,500 for $2,001 to $5,000,
$7,500 for $5,001 to $10,000, and $12,500
for $10,001 to $15,000. By this procedure
we estimated per capita income as $1,440.

For comparison, employing the same
method to obtain an estimate for income
as we did for education of the general
population of the 27 counties, we found
the per capita income to be $1,630.

MALIGNANCY IN THE ANCESTORS

In the questionnaire we asked for either
a “yes” or “no” response to the following
questions: Does anyone else in the family
(including uncles, aunts, cousins, grandparents) have any physical defects, mongolism, or other conditions (such as cancer, leukemia, blood disease, etc.)? To
“yes”? answers, we requested: Please explain, including a description of the relationship to your mongoloid child (for
example: “Mother’s sister’s son had leukemia,” ‘“Father’s father had stomach
cancer,” etc.). Table 5 shows that half
again as many grandparents were reported
to have malignant disease as the greatgrandparents, who naturally, outnumber

Social Biology

the former by a factor of two. We concluded that information on the greatgrandparents is unreliable for several reasons: for example, the respondents’ less
adequate knowledge of the more remote
generation, the questionnaire’s not asking
specifically about great-grandparents, and
the greater diagnostic accuracy during the
lifetime of the more recent generation.

Three ancestors, namely two grandparents and one great-grandparent, were reported to have had leukemia; two had
chronic myelocytic leukemia, the other
acute lymphatic Jeukemia. We may estimate the frequency of leukemia among
the ancestors of the three previous generations to be at least 3/1,120, since we can
safely assume that some of the informants
may not have known the health history of
their ancestors. Obviously, the three generations of ancestors have had varying
lifetimes of exposure to the risk of developing leukemia, but as a probable minimal
estimate, if we assume a mean age of 45
years of all 1,120 ancestors, then they
represent a total of 1,120 times 45 equals
50,400 years at risk.

the United States was 6.1/100,000 in 1959
(Lerner and Anderson, 1963). Actually,
we should have applied the appropriate
rates to the exact years the ancestors were
at risk, but in the absence of these data
and also without evidence that the mortality rate from leukemia has changed
drastically, we estimated that 3.1 deaths
would be expected in 50,400 years at risk.
Consequently, there was no evidence in our
patients’ ancestors of altered mortality to
this one category of malignant disease.

There were 23 instances of malignant
disease among the mothers and maternal
ancestors and 20 instances among the fathers and paternal ancestors.

DISCUSSION

The reproductive performance of the
parents of our subjects may be compared
with that of the 110 mothers of living
G-trisomics reported by Buck et al. (1966).
Their report stated only that many women had not passed the childbearing age
so that direct comparison with our data
was not possible, From it we calculated
that the 110 women had a mean of 3.9 pregnancies, naturally the older women more
than the younger. Our population, perhaps
older, had a higher mean of 4.5, Likewise
from their data, we calculated that approximately 16% of pregnancies in the
mothers of G-trisomics were lost, after excluding the G-trisomic which was always a
livebirth. When we made a similar correction in every case for ascertainment of a
livebirth, we found a rate of nearly 12%
fetal loss through abortion and stillbirth.
This does not lead us to conclude that our
population was less prone to fetal loss
because of the likelihood of some incompleteness in our responses.

The significance of our showing a birth
order or maternal age effect lies not in
that fact itself, for the association of
maternal age and therefore also of birth

Parental Factors in G, Trisomy

All

order has long been recognized; rather,
added to our clinical impressions and the
cytogenetic data, it reassures us that we
studied an average population of patients
with G-trisomy. We used a simple exact
test for birth-order effect (Haldane and
Smith, 1948) which tests whether the probability of a child inheriting a certain condition increases or decreases with its birth
rank, other things remaining equal. Given
a set of sibships containing normal and
affected siblings, in order to determine a
maternal age or birth-order effect, the
sum (A) of the birth ranks of all affected
sibs is compared with its theoretical mean
value calculated on the assumption of no
effect. If A exceeds this mean by more than
twice its standard deviation, then there is
evidence that later sibs are most likely
affected; but, if A is less than the mean
by the same amount, earlier sibs are most
probably affected. The sum of the birth
ranks of our patients exceeded the theoretical mean value by nearly six standard
deviations. However, that maternal age
and not birth rank is determinative was
shown by Smith and Record (1955), who
concluded that although incidence of Gtrisomy increases regularly with increasing
birth rank, this association is eliminated
when maternal age is fixed.

The sex ratio of the G-trisomics is the
same as the secondary sex ratio at birth
of the normal population, which is somewhat surprising, since Record and Smith
(1955) determined that in infancy and
early childhood affected females have
greater mortality rates than affected
males. More recently, MacKay and Weir
(1970) also found rather high sex ratios
in northern Ireland and northeastern Scotland.

During 1971 different investigators pursued again the question of a relationship
between parental age and sex of the affected offspring. Largey and Largey

(1971) observed that the mean maternal
age was lower when the offspring with
G-trisomy was female than when male,
reporting a mean maternal age difference
of 2.97 years and stating that it was
significant, though giving no details. Spencer (1971) presented a slightly larger
sample with a mean maternal age difference
of 3.00 years; however, again, there were
no details and no test of significance.
Fedrick (1971) had a small sample and
found a slightly lower mean maternal age
of female patients surviving the neonatal
period but a slightly higher mean maternal
age of females among patients not surviving the neonatal period, yet neither
difference appeared significant.
Subsequent reports with larger numbers
(Perry, 1971; Qazi and Lanman, 1971;
Ros et al., 1971) including a summary of
several previous studies by Perry were not
confirmatory; and neither are our data.
Our recording no consanguineous marriages in the 80 couples is not surprising,
since the frequency of first cousin marriages in the present general population of
the United States has been estimated to
be less than 0.1% (Freire-Maia, 1957),
and, specifically in a sampling of West
Virginia Caucasian coal miners, only 1.1%
to 1.5% of marriages were between persons
related in any degree (Juberg, 1970). Further, no evidence yet indicates that the
progeny of consanguineous matings are
more liable to meiotic nondisjunction than
those from nonconsanguineous matings
(Matsunaga, 1966; Forssman and Akesson, 1967; Juberg and Davis, 1970).
Because of the relatively small number
of families in our survey, and the incompleteness of the sibships, and without correction for the effect of maternal age on
the frequency of dizygotic twinning, we
can only note that we found a higher rate
of twin pregnancies than we anticipated,
that is, 1.5% compared with 1.0% in Cau
Social Biology

casians in the United States (Myrianthopoulos, 1970). The question of an association between the cause or causes of
meiotic nondisjunction and twinning has
been investigated with somewhat conflicting results (Nielsen, 1968; Soltan, 1968;
Nance and Uchida, 1964), though presumably the effect would only be with
maternally determined nondisjunction.

The significant interval between the
preceding birth and the birth of the Gtrisomic, which we showed to be due to
terminal births, cannot be satisfactorily
explained without additional data, because
we do not know the proportions of planned
and unplanned pregnancies, nor the ease
of conception for the planned proportion,
nor the contraceptive practices of the
couples. One explanation of an increased
birth interval is that it results from pregnancies lost between livebirths. Such an
explanation for the increased interval we
report is unlikely because we found only
12% of pregnancies wasted, which is lower
than the usual rate (Warburton and Fraser, 1964; Buck et al., 1966); even assuming considerable underreporting from
the respondents, we consider this reason
improbable.

A second reason for an increased birth
interval is that the pregnancy was unplanned and came at the end of the mother’s reproductive life as an additional rather
than a delayed pregnancy. The data of
Buck et al. (1966) suggest that the Gtrisomic of the older mother is the result
of such an extra pregnancy. In an effort
to see what the increased birth interval
may mean, we compared our data with the
birth intervals in a population reproducing naturally, that is, without any apparent attempt to control fertility by any
method. The Amish are just such a group
(Juberg, 1966). Juberg (unpublished observation, 1973) found the birth interval
preceding the last birth to be 3.14 years

Vol. 20, No. 4

for 153 births in a population for which the
mean interval between 815 other births
was 2.02 years, excluding the intervals
preceding both final and first births. Following the same procedure we have calculated that 3.51 years preceded 731 terminal births and 2.15 years the other 3,424
births in a different group of Amish (Cross
and McKusick, 1970). Although the mean
interval between all other births in the
two Amish populations is less than that of
this study, the interval before the final
birth is much less, that is, 3.14 and 3.51
years before the normal terminal births
versus 5.27 years before the chromosomally
abnormal terminal births.

The association of advanced maternal
age with a G-trisomic offspring has yet to
be explained. One hypothesis attributes
aneuploidy to the fertilization of an aging
egg as a result of the diminishing frequency of intercourse with increasing years
of cohabitation (German, 1968). Another
proposal states that the longer interval results from a period of incompatability between mother and fetus, particularly for
chromosomally abnormal offspring, which
may produce lost pregnancies before an
ensuing time of compatability, by which
time the chromosomally abnormal fetus is
tolerated (Renkonen and Donner, 1964).

Diminishing frequency of intercourse
with increasing years of cohabitation naturally decreases the probability of pregnancy as well as increases the intervals
between births, depending upon contraceptive practices. If the likelihood of an
error in chromatid disjunction rises with
aging of the egg (aging in the sense of
time from ovulation to fertilization), then
diminished frequency of intercourse would
be contributory to the production of aneuploid offspring. Another consequence expected of a decline in frequency of intercourse would be increased birth interval.
Thus, the greatly lengthened birth interval

preceding the terminal birth of a G-trisomic would appear to support the agingegg hypothesis.

When the data on education and income
are considered together, the parents of the
patients apparently have more education
and less income than the comparison group,
perhaps a paradoxical situation except to
academics, Actually, without estimates of
the variability of our data, which we considered unjustified, we concluded that as
judged by education and stated income,
the parents of the aneuploids were not
significantly different from the general
population. It is possible that the more
educated parents understood better than
the less educated the medical liabilities of
the abnormal child and sought more frequent medical care, resulting in some differential survival.

Kaplan and Zsako (1966) found a history of malignant disease among more
maternal than paternal ancestors of 40
G-trisomics, but we did not confirm this
among the ancestors of 80 patients. Their
inquiry may have been more successful
than ours because they obtained detailed
family histories, whereas we relied solely
upon questionnaires. We were particularly
interested in the number of ancestors with
leukemia, specifically chronic myelocytic,
and their degree of relationship to the patient with G-trisomy, under the hypothesis
of some type of inherited liability of the
G,; chromosome to abnormalities of stability, both of disjunction and integrity. Our
failure to find more affected ancestors than
expected does not eliminate the possibility
of an inherited liability in certain families.

SUMMARY

This study tested our postulate of the
existence of living patterns due to socioeconomic or educational similarities which
might lead to the recognition of causative
factors in meiotic nondisjunction. We ob

tained data by questionnaire concerning 80
families. The effects of maternal age and
birth order were as predicted, and the sex
ratio of neither the propositi nor their normal siblings was deviant. Neither maternal
nor paternal age differed according to the
sex of the propositi. No parents were consanguineous. Frequency of twin pregnancies
was greater than expected. Compared with
the general population of their counties

of residence in West Virginia, the parents
had more education and less income. We
calculated intervals between live births determining that 4:18 years preceded the
propositi and 2.83 years came before all
normal siblings (p < 0.005); for terminal
births the interval preceding the propositi
was 5.27 years compared with 2.58 years
for the normals (p < 0.005), but for nonterminal births there were no differences.
