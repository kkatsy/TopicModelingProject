ABSTRACT: This article provides an analytical account of the variability in and correlates of
Brazil’s childlessness rates. Following from the socioeconomic development model, which
suggests that involuntary childlessness predominates among developing countries and voluntary childlessness among developed countries, this paper examines the extent to which
levels of development are related to age-specific rates of childlessness in the states and territories
of Brazil. We find both variation within the age-specific childlessness rates and important
associations between measures of economic development in 1970 and the rates of childlessness
in 1980. Moreover, childlessness in Brazil tends to be more voluntary than involuntary,

particularly among the younger women in the more modernized subregions of the country.

Considerable demographic study in
past decades has been devoted to analyses of the demographic transition. How
ever, virtually all of the attention has fo
cused primarily on changes in fertility
and mortality, with little attention given
to changes in childlessness. While the
propositions of transition theory do not
speak directly to childlessness, many of
the factors related to the fertility and
mortality transitions should be related
to trends in childlessness. Indeed, recent analyses have suggested that the social and economic developmental processes in a country influence voluntary
and involuntary childlessness in a way
similar to that of fertility (Poston and
Trent, 1984; Poston et al., 1985). Other
studies have shown that not all women
who want children have them and that
childlessness rates show substantial variation over time (Veevers, 1972; Poston
and Trent, 1982). In this paper we focus
on the states and territories of Brazil in
1980 and examine the extent to which

267

levels of development are related to
rates of childlessness.

Brazil is an intriguing country for demographic study. Internationally, it 1s
the fifth largest in land mass and the
sixth largest in population size (Population Reference Bureau, 1986). Moreover, it exerts extensive political and economic influence on other countries,
particularly those in Latin America. Occupying more than one-half of the South
American continent, Brazil is the largest
country in South America in population
and land mass (Population Reference
Bureau, 1986). The Brazilians have
been involved in economic, political,
and social change for decades. And
since the mid 1950’s, they have been actively engaged in programs of economic
development (Collier’s Encyclopedia,
1982, p. 495). Brazil has a higher standard of living than any other Latin American country, save Argentina, although
it is still plagued by some economic and
political turmoil. Several of Brazil’s cit

ies, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, to
cite two, are major cities of industrialization, and very similar to American
and European cities. However, there
are also states and territories in the
northern areas of the country which remain undeveloped socially, economically, and demographically.

In this paper we analyze the relation
ships between modernization and childlessness among 25 geographical units of
Brazil, including 21 states, 3 territories,
and the Federal District. We use seven
age-specific rates of childlessness computed for 1980 grouped in 5-year inter
“vals. We find both variation within the

childlessness rates, as well as important
associations between measures of economic development in 1970 and the
rates of childlessness in 1980.

We turn next to a review of prior
studies of childlessness and their relevance for an analysis of Brazil. Later we
develop a theoretical model, discuss the
data and methods, and then present our
results and discuss their implications.

PRIOR INVESTIGATIONS OF
CHILDLESSNESS

Most prior studies of childlessness
have focused on the United States and
Canada (e.g., the census-based analyses
of Grabill and Glick, 1959; Poston and
Gotard, 1977; Davis, 1982; Veevers,
1972, and Wolowyna, 1977, among others). In recent years there have been a
few studies dealing with other countries.
We will review some of these in this section to place in perspective our analysis
of childlessness among the states and
territories of Brazil.

One recent investigation of international patterns of childlessness focused
on 65 developed and developing countries of the world in the circa-1970 per
 

Social Biology

iod (Poston and Trent, 1982). The study
found rather substantial variation in the
phenomenon and also reported patterns
of childlessness in the developed countries different from those in the developing countries. Another analysis dealt
solely with developing countries and ascertained the degree to which levels of
development were associated with rates
of childlessness (Poston and Trent,
1984). Hypotheses were set forth expecting negative relationships between
childlessness and three components of
economic development pertaining to
structural development, health conditions, and female status. All found support in the data, with health conditions
showing the highest correlation.

Other studies of Zaire (Romaniuk,
1980; Tabutin, 1982), of the James Bay
Indians (Romaniuk, 1974), and of Mexico (Poston et al., 1985) have reported
similar results, that is, negative associations between levels of development
and rates of childlessness. One recent
analysis, however, of the hsiens and major cities of Taiwan found positive associations between various measures of
modernization and childlessness (Poston et al., 1984). Unlike the countries
analyzed in the other childlessness studies just reviewed, Taiwan has been characterized by both considerable economic development since the end of
World War II, along with a concomitant
fertility decline. The finding of a positive
association there between levels of development and childlessness suggests
the presence of varying although small
amounts of voluntary childlessness in
the more developed areas on the island.

A recent cross-sectional study of the
governorates of the Arab Republic of
Egypt found positive associations between measures of modernization and
childlessness rates of younger women,

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

Vol. 35, No. 3-4

but negative associations between the
modernization variables and childlessness rates of older women (Poston and
el-Badry, 1987). As with Taiwan, Egypt
has also been experiencing economic
development, although more recently.
Results from the study of Egypt suggest
the presence of varying amounts of involuntary childlessness among the older
women, and varying, although small,
amounts of voluntary childlessness
among the younger women, especially
among those in the more developed
governorates of the country (see also
Poston and El-Badry, 1986).

With the exception of the Taiwan and
Egypt studies, most other analyses of
countries in the developing world may
not be that pertinent to an understanding of the association between modernization and childlessness among the
states of Brazil in 1980. Apart from the
Taiwan analysis, and to some extent that
of Egypt, the studies just discussed have
shown, for the most part, that childlessness decreases in a population (and fertility increases) during its incipient states
of modernization. This occurs because
the early development strategies, especially those pertaining to the enhancement of health conditions through the
reduction of infectious disease and malnutrition, cause childlessness to decline
since it is mainly involuntary, and fertility, aS a consequence, to increase. Presumably this was the situation in the
countries just reviewed, except in Taiwan, and among younger women in
Egypt, and provides a reasonable interpretation of the negative relationships
found in those countries between measures of economic development and levels of childlessness.

However, as we know from demographic transition theory, with the continuation of modernization, fertility

269

eventually begins to decline and continues to do so. Levels of childlessness,
which have become quite low, then begin to increase. This increasing childlessness, however, is due to increases in
voluntary childlessness. Presumably this
was the situation characterizing the association between development and
childlessness in Taiwan, and among the
younger Egyptian women, as reviewed,
and should be applicable, we would argue, for Brazil as well. At this stage both
childlessness and fertility should be responding to the various developmental
mechanisms, especially those dealing
with enhanced educational opportunities for women and increasing rates of
female labor force participation. These
modernization influences should now
result in increases in childlessness and
decreases in fertility.

With respect to current conditions in
Brazil, the country is not at all a stranger
to socioeconomic development. Similar
to Taiwan, Brazil has been an active participant in economic development programs for some time. In 1956, the President of Brazil, Juscelino Kubitschek,
initiated a number of economic programs, including development of industrial power (electric power plants), and
transportation and communication networks (Collier’s Encyclopedia, 1982, p.
513). The construction of the present
capital, Brasilia, began in 1960 and today stands as a modern city in terms of
architecture, planning, and design.
Since the mid 1950’s, the government
has continued to support industrialization, even through periods of economic,
political, and military disruption.

Presently, industry is a major source
of Brazilian income. The manufacturing
industry in 1977 contributed to 23 per
cent of the country’s gross domestic
product (Collier’s Encyclopedia, 1982,

 

 

 

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

270 Poston and Rogers

p. 496). About 20 per cent of Brazil’s labor force is in industry. However, industry in Brazil is largely concentrated in
the Eastern states. About half of the factories in Brazil are located in the states
of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Minas
Gerais. Some of the key industries are
textiles, food processing, transportation
equipment, manufacturing, and fertilizer production. In 1978, Brazil’s gross
national product ranked tenth among all
countries (Kurian, 1982, p. 228).

Therefore, in many ways Brazil may
be characterized as currently experiencing the later stages of modernization.
The social structure is changing from
one of a traditionally agrarian society
with strong familial bonds to an urban
and industrial society with a heavy dependence on institutions. Nevertheless,
there are discontinuities. The states of
Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, as well as
the Federal District, are very similar in
their overall characteristics, to areas in
the United States or Europe. The Federal District, which is almost entirely
comprised of the city of Brasilia, is 96
per cent urban. The states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo are 88 and 80 per
cent urban, respectively. In contrast,
Piaui, a northern state in the undeveloped Amazonian frontier is only 3 per
cent urban. Maranhao, a state in the underdeveloped northwest region, is 25
per cent urban. Further, although Brazil
is modernized, it still depends heavily on
selling raw materials (coffee, iron,
sugar) and buying finished products
(chemicals, fuels, wheat).

These are important distinctions to
make, since despite the variation in socioeconomic development in Brazil, the
country clearly has advanced significantly toward full modernization.
Given its current stage of development,
we are inclined to hypothesize a positive

association between levels of modernization in 1970 and rates of childlessness
in 1980 among the states and territories
of Brazil.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The childlessness data used in this
study are taken from the 1980 census of
Brazil (IBGE, 1983). Indicators of economic development have been drawn
mainly from the 1970 census, the Census
Preliminary Reports, and the Statistical
Abstract of Brazil, all circa-1970
(IBGE, 1970, 1971, 1973).

In 1970, asin 1980, Brazil was divided
into 27 subregions, including 22 states, 4
territories, and the Federal District. Between 1970 and 1980, however, the
composition of several states changed.
In 1974, the states of Rio de Janeiro and
Guanabara merged, to form the single
state of Rio de Janeiro. For comparability between 1970 and 1980, we have
merged the data for these two states for
1970 and treat them in both years as
one, Rio de Janeiro. Conversely, in
1977, Mato Grosso was split to form the
two states of Mato Grosso and Mato
Grosso do Sul. For comparability, we
have merged the data for the two states
for 1980 and treat the two in both periods as the single state of Mato Grosso.
One of the territories, Fernando de
Noronha, an island off the Northeastern
coast, has been excluded because little
information for the territory is available. Our study thus involves 25 contiguous states and territories of Brazil, as
just defined, and encompasses the entire
country, save the Fernando de Noronha
island.

MEASUREMENT OF CHILDLESSNESS

Using census data on the number of
children ever born to ever-married

Vol. 35, No. 3-4

women, we have computed for each of
the 25 Brazilian subregions, a schedule
of seven age-specific marital childlessness rates (ASMCR). The rate for age
group i may be defined as follows:
ASMCR; = L;/P;

where L; represents the number of evermarried women in age group / with no
children ever born to them, and P; represents the population of ever-married
women in age group i. ASMCR’s have
been computed for each of the seven age
groups 15~19, 20-24, 25-29, ... 4549. |

Table 1 lists the seven age-specific
childlessness rates for each of the 25
Brazilian areas. The highest rates across
the seven age groups are found for the

271

most part in the developed Southeastern
states, for instance in Rio de Janeiro and
Rio Grande do Sul; rates in the middle
range are found mainly in the East Central states, including Mato Grosso and
Goias; the lowest rates are found in the
Northern states and territories including
Rondonia, Acre, and Amapa.

The map in Figure 1 illustrates the
variation in childlessness for women
aged 20 to 24. The highest rates are
found along the coast, and as one moves
inland toward the interior and toward
the Northern territories, the childlessness rates decrease. While these are
general trends, there is also a fair
amount of variation between states.
Similar areal patterns of variation are

found among women in most of the
other groups.

Delving further into specific differences among the states, consider the differences between Rio de Janeiro and
Amapa (see Table 1). In Rio de Janeiro
in 1980, for example, for every 1,000
ever-married women in the 15-19 year
age group, 399 were childless, whereas
for every 1,000 in the 45-49 year old
group, 81 were childless. At the other
end. of the distribution is Amapa with
321 childless women per 1,000 ever
married in the group 15-19, and 48
childless women in the 45-49 year old
group.

We have graphed in Figure 2 the
seven age-specific marital childlessness
rates for Rio de Janeiro and Amapa.
Observe the rather sizeable differences
between the rates for Rio de Janeiro and
those for Amapa. At age 15-19, the
rates are 0.40 for Rio de Janeiro and
0.32 for Amapa. The differences in rates
narrow somewhat as the age groups get
older, but even at age 40-44, the differ

ence is still substantial: 0.08 for Rio de
Janeiro versus 0.05 for Amapa. These
two illustrative states are not deviant
cases. Indeed, the other Brazilian states
are distributed rather evenly throughout
this range, suggesting significant variation in the distributions of the seven
rates across the 25 states and territories.

Observe also in Figure 2 the patterning of the seven childlessness rates for
Rio de Janeiro and Amapa. Although

the ASMCR’s for any one age group
vary considerably between states (see
also Tables 1 and 2), the patterning of
rates across the seven age groups Is very
similar from one state to the next. Generally the rates are at their maximum
among the 15-19 year old ever-married
women and decline rapidly to the 30-34
age group. They then maintain relative
stability throughout the remaining three
age groups (35-39, 40-44, and 45-49).

Since the rates are period and not cohort
rates, however, this pattern occasionally
varies.

Table 2 presents means, standard deviations, and minimum and maximum
values for each of the seven marital
childlessness rates. The magnitude of
the standard deviations confirms the
above suggestion about variability in the
childlessness rates. Note that as one progresses from the younger to the older
age groups, the variability decreases.

INDEPENDENT VARIABLES

The hypothesis guiding this analysis
expects a positive relationship between
modernization and childlessness in the
states of Brazil. In an attempt to set
forth the relevant independent variables
needed to capture the principal components of the modernization process, we
have followed Goldscheider’s sugges
tions that “the key to understanding

modernization begins with the process
of structural differentiation . . . of major social structures, roles and organization ... including specialization and
separation of economic, family and religious, political and stratification systems” (1971, p. 93). Under ideal conditions of data availability, one would do

well to obtain empirical indicators of all
the various modernization dimensions
set forth by Goldscheider. Unfortunately, data on the states of Brazil in the
circa-1970 time period were not available for all these modernization components. We were able to obtain data on
the thirteen following modernization indicators: the average of the two distances from the state’s capital to Brasilia
and to Rio de Janeiro; electricity consumption; female labor force participation; female college attainment; an indicator of female status measured by the
ratio of female to male college attainment; persons per room; rooms per
house; female literacy; another indicator of female status measured by the ratio of female to male labor force participation; proportion of the population
that is Catholic; an indicator of family
size measured by the proportion of families with five individuals; and rates of infectious and maternal mortality. These
thirteen variables are listed in Table 3
along with their operational definitions,
their average values, standard deviations, and minimum and maximum values.

The anticipated relationships between many of the development indicators and childlessness are rather

straightforward, given the general hypothesis of a positive association between modernization and childlessness.
Let us discuss them and the nature of
their expected associations with childlessness. All of the modernization variables apply to the year 1970. In our endeavor to account for variation in the
1980 rates of childlessness among the
Brazilian subregions, we have lagged
the modernization variables by ten
years. Following the work of Cutright
and Kelly (1978) and Poston and Trent
(1984), we are assuming that changes in
levels of development and ultimate
changes in childlessness require a temporal lag of at least ten years, and even
longer for the rates of older women.
We have gathered data on the aver
 

age distance (in kilometers) between
each state capital and Brasilia and Rio
de Janeiro in an attempt to develop a
proxy indicator of the influence of these
two major Brazilian cities. For each
state capital we have taken the average
of the sum of the two distances (Brasilia
and Rio de Janeiro have each been assigned scores of zero). In the most literal
sense of the word, these cities are the
centers of activity in the country and exert significant influence of a modernizing nature on the other populations in
the country. Thus we expect that the
more distant a state capital from these
two cities, the less the level of modernization of the state. Hence, the greater
the DISTANCE, the less the childlessness rates.

Two variables, persons per room
(PROOM) and rooms per house
(RHOUSE) are measures of crowding
and affluence. The PROOM variable
reflects the average degree of crowding
in an area and should be negatively associated with modernization; we expect a
negative relationship between this mea
‘sure and childlessness. The RHOUSE is

a proxy for the degree of relative
affluence in the area and should be positively associated with modernization;
we anticipate that this variable will be
positively associated with childlessness.
We have also included a family size
variable, the proportion of families with
five individuals. A family with five individuals would typically be comprised of
two parents and three children, or, perhaps, two parents, two children, and
one grandparent. A family of this size,
especially the first configuration, reflects
the kind of “nuclear” pattern indicative
of areas experiencing the modernization
process. The more modernized the
area, the greater the proportion of families comprised of five individuals. Thus
we would expect a positive association
between this variable and childlessness.
As acountry, Brazil is strongly Catholic with over 90 per cent of the population recording their religious affiliation
as Catholic in the 1970 census. However, we would expect that with increasing modernization, internal and international migration into the major cities,
and the interchange of new ideas and
values, that the proportion Catholic in
an area should decline. Thus, the more
secular the area, the lower the proportion Catholic, the greater its level of
modernization. Therefore, we expect a
negative association between the proportion of the population Catholic and
childlessness. a

tain to INFECTIOUS and MATERNAL MORTALITY. The lower the
mortality rates of a state, the higher its
standards of living, and the higher its
levels of development; thus, the higher
its rates of childlessness. Recall our earlier observations that given the development already in effect in Brazil considerably prior to 1970, most of the variation
in childlessness among the 25 areas in
1980 should be due mainly to voluntary
childlessness. The associations of these
two mortality variables on childlessness
in this context are thus expected to be
negative, and not positive, as they have
been shown to be among countries at
much earlier stages of modernization
(see Romaniuk, 1974, 1980; Poston et
al., 1985). Data for these two variables,
however, are available for only 17 of the
25 Brazilian subregions.

Regarding the other modernization
variables, we expect positive associations between childlessness and those

‘pertaining to energy consumption; fe
male labor force participation; literacy;
female college attainment; and the two
female status indicators. We turn now to
the results of our inquiry.

RESULTS

In this section we examine the results
obtained from testing the general hypothesis anticipating a positive relationship between modernization and seven
age-specific rates of childlessness in
1980, among the 25 states and territories
of Brazil. We have argued in the preceding paragraphs that a positive association is expected between modernization
and most of the childlessness rates because the variability in childlessness
among the Brazilian states should be
due mainly to the phenomenon’s voluntary component. Childlessness is hence
expected to respond positively to the

same kinds of modernization mechanisms which elicit negative responses in
fertility behavior.

It is recalled that we are employing
seven age-specific rates of marital childlessness for each of the 25 states and territories for the age groups 15-19, 20-24,
25-29, . . . 45-49. Our reasons for using a full schedule of seven rates are two:
First, the utilization of seven rates of
childlessness will permit us to ascertain
the influences of the modernization variables at all stages of the reproductive life
cycles of the Brazilian married females
from the very youngest to the oldest.
Second, given the above argument that
much of the variation in childlessness in
the Brazilian states is due to voluntary
factors, the use of the seven age-specific
rates will provide an opportunity to appraise this question indirectly. Voluntary childlessness should be more prominent among the younger ever-married
women, particularly those in their 20’s,
than among, say, the ever-married in
their mid-thirty’s, because of the timing
of modernization and development in
Brazil. Much of the evidence cited earlier about economic development in
Brazil indicates that the phenomenon

has had substantial impact mainly since

the end of the mid 1950’s. Prior to the
mid-1950’s, Brazil ranked low on most
indicators of social and economic development. Studies of other countries at
similar stages of economic development
have shown that childlessness under
these situations is mainly involuntary
(Romaniuk, 1980; Poston et al., 1985),
which means that the women in the age
groups 35-39, 40—44, and 45-49 in 1970
were in their prime reproductive years
at a period of time when voluntary childlessness was uncommon. Women in the
age groups 25—29 and 30-34 in 1980 are
a transitional age group in that a portion

Childlessness in Brazil

 

277

of their main childbearing years was
spent during the years when Brazil
moved from a developing to a semideveloped country. Accordingly, the childlessness existing among these women
should be both voluntary and involuntary. These women should have more
voluntary childlessness than the women
in their 40’s, but less than those in their
20’s.

If the above reasoning has merit, the
development indicators should have the
highest positive correlations with agespecific rates of childlessness for women
20-24 and 25-29. The correlations between development and childlessness
should be lower in magnitude among
women 30-34 and 35-39 years old, and
even lower among the women in their
40’s.

Before examining the results of these
investigations, we present in Table 4a
zero-order correlation matrix computed
for the seven age-specific rates of marital childlessness for the 25 Brazilian
units in 1980. Observe that the relationship between any two rates is highest
when the rates apply to contiguous age
groups, and lowest between rates at the
extreme ends of the age distribution. To
illustrate, the correlation between the
rates for age groups 20-24 and 25-29 is
0.81, that between the childlessness
rates for age groups 30-34 and 35-39 is
0.88, and so forth. Conversely, the correlation between the rates computed for
age groups 15-19 and 45-49 is 0.29. This
matrix shows considerable differences
in the levels of age-specific rates of childlessness across the age groups and the
states and territories in 1980. The employment of all seven age-specific rates
in the examination of the developmentchildlessness relationships will permit
even more extensive tests of the hypotheses than if a single rate were used.

Correlations between the seven agespecific childlessness rates with the indicators of modernization are presented in
Table 5. Generally, our hypotheses are
confirmed. Note that most of the indicators have their highest correlations with
childlessness at those ages where voluntary childlessness would be more susceptible to the influences of modernization, that is, women in their early years
of reproduction.

The cross-sectional results in Table 5
permit the following generalizations

_ about modernization and childlessness

among the Brazilian states. As distance
from the major cities increases, childlessness decreases. Thus, the farther
from the modernizing influences of a
city, the less the childlessness. Conversely, as energy consumption increases, indicating increasing modernization, childlessness rates increase.
Table 5 shows that as people tend toward nuclear families, childlessness increases. We also find that as the number
of rooms per house increases, and as the
number of people per room decreases,
childlessness increases.

As females break with traditional society, they generally become more educated, more integrated into the industrial network, gain higher status, and
join the work force in larger numbers.
This progression leads to higher rates of
childlessness, as is borne out in Table 5,
where such variables as female labor
force participation, literacy, college attainment, and female status in school
and employment are all positively related with childlessness.

Our measures of health are also related to modernization. Thus, we would
expect that as modernization increases,
mortality will decrease, and childlessness will increase. We see this association in maternal mortality and in mortality caused by infectious and parasitic
diseases, especially among the younger
women. Of these two variables, mortality caused by infectious disease relates
most strongly with childlessness.

Our religious variable is a general
measure of the strength and pervasiveness of the Catholic church, mediated
through modernization, in influencing
childbearing. We see a negative relation
between per cent of the population
Catholic and rates of childlessness.
These results allow us to suggest that increased migration and greater interchanges of new ideas tend to reduce the
proportion that is Catholic and concomitantly increase the childlessness rates.
Therefore, with zero-order correlations, our major hypotheses have been
well supported by the data in Table 5
among the Brazilian subregions in 1980.
The higher the modernization levels,
the higher the childlessness rates.

To analyze our variables beyond the
bivariate level, we need to employ regression analysis. However, multiple regression is not appropriate for 25 observations and 13 variables, especially since

many of the variables are highly related
with each other. Therefore, we will factor analyze our modernization variables
and then regress each of the seven childlessness rates on the emerging factor
scores. Since the factors will be independent of one another, multicollinearity
will no longer be a problem.

The mortality measures are available
for only 17 of the 12 Brazilian units. Unfortunately, the missing data are not
normally distributed among the various
states and territories. Indeed, our mortality variables are not available for any
of the territories in Brazil, and are also
not available for some of the less modernized states. We were only able to include the mortality variables in the zeroorder correlation analyses, and had to
exclude them from the regression analyses,!

Using the 11 modernization variables, we performed a principal components factor analysis, using varimax rotation.* We selected factors with
eigen-values greater than 1.0. The factor analysis produced three separate factors, accounting for 83 per cent of the
Original variance from the 11 variables.
The factor analysis results are shown in
Table 6.

Factor I is composed of high positive
loadings on energy, female college at
For those 17 subregions of Brazil with data on
all 13 variables, we performed a factor analysis of
all 13 variables; we also regressed each of the seven
childlessness rates on the factors. Our results
showed that the factors separated in about the
same way, with similar loadings. Since we did not
gain a separate health or mortality factor, did not
gain in interpretation, nor in variance explained,
but did lose in terms of degrees of freedom, we report in the paper the results of the factor analysis of
those 11 variables for which data are available for
all 25 subregions.

tainment and literacy, female status in
the labor force, and nuclear families,
and a high negative loading on the religious variable. The factor accounts for
56 per cent of the variance from the original 11 variables. These variables tap
various dimensions of structural and cultural modernization.

Factor II contains a high positive
loading on the distance variables, indicating the influence of major industrial,
political, and economic centers. This
factor positively loads on people per
room and negatively loads on rooms per
house. This dimension represented by
Factor II indicates the affluence and the
influence of an area. This factor accounts for 16 per cent of the original varlance.

Factor III is characterized by high
positive loadings on female labor force
participation and the status of females
attaining college degrees. Moreover,
there is a high positive secondary loading on this factor for the variable reflecting the status of women in the work
force. This factor, which explains 11 per
cent of the original variance, has been
identified as a female status factor.

We can now regress each of the childlessness rates on these three factors in an
attempt to ascertain which of the factors
best predicts or explains childlessness
among the subregions of Brazil.

Table 7 presents the seven regressions of the three factors on each childlessness age group. The models all fit
well, with adjusted R?’s ranging from
0.252 to 0.664.

Factor I follows the pattern we predicted, except for the first age group. As
modernization increases, the structural
and cultural effects on childlessness increase. The modernization factors are
strongest for the 20-24 and 25~29 year
age groups. Observe that there is a negative relation between modernization
and childlessness in the older age
groups. This finding implies, as expected, a higher degree of involuntary
childlessness, especially between the
40-44 and 45—49 year old women. —

the impact of influence/affluence on
childlessness. Factor II exhibits strong

tor II displays positive associations with
childlessness.

We hypothesized that Factor III
would relate positively with childless
rates for women in the younger ages and
negatively for women in the older ages.
The relation does not entirely hold. The
associations between childlessness and
this factor, primarily comprised of female status, drop in the older age
groups, but do not reverse signs. Our
post-hoc explanation of this pattern is
that more women are completing school
and are entering the job market, but
their actual status, while changing, has
not changed radically. Alternatively, female status may act independently of
many structural modernizing influences.
Social change is slower than technical or
industrial change. Nevertheless, there is
a strong relation between Factor III and
childlessness, especially in the 30-34
and 35-39 year age groups. Thus, for
the most part, we have found that as
modernization increases, so do the
childlessness rates in Brazil.

SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS

We began this study by hypothesizing
that, among the Brazilian states, territories, and Federal District, various as
pects of modernization should be related positively to childlessness. Brazil is
a modern, industria] country. The association of development with childlessness, we reasoned, should more closely
parallel the results of a study reported
earlier for Taiwan. Thus, young women
in the more developed areas of Brazil
should be more characterized by voluntary childlessness. Older women in the
less developed areas of Brazil should be
more characterized by involuntary
childlessness.

In our study, we first introduced a
number of modernization variables
reflecting aspects of affluence and influence; female status, education, and

“employment; religion; and mortality.

Zero-order correlations between these
variables and each of the age-specific
childlessness rates showed general support for our hypothesized relations, especially among women in the younger
age groups.

Next, we investigated how well the
modernization variables collectively
could account for age-specific childlessness rates. To address this question, we
factor analyzed the eleven independent
variables and obtained three factors.
The factors reflected structural and social modernization, influence and

282 Poston and Rogers

affluence, and female status. Last, we
employed these factors in a series of regression equations with each of the
childlessness rates.

The regression equations displayed
the relative influence of each of the various factors. Interestingly, no one factor
maintained dominance throughout all
seven age groups. The influence/
affluence factor was the strongest for the
first age group, and female status was
the strongest for women in the older
ages. If female status remains high for
some time, irrespective of changes in
modernization, this could likely affect
the childlessness rates.

Women in early childbearing years
are now in the position to make use of
modernization features and their influences on voluntary childlessness.
Women in the later age groups have already passed through their childbearing
years before Brazil was industrialized.
Therefore, their childlessness patterns
are less likely to be affected by any modernization influences.

We end this paper by examining our
findings in light of prior investigations of
modernization and childlessness conducted in other countries. We have already observed that many subregional
studies of this relationship have concluded that decreases occur generally in
childlessness during a country’s or subregion’s early stages of modernization.
This is due to the fact that the bulk of the
childlessness is involuntary. For example, Romaniuk demonstrated this relationship among the James Bay Indians
(1974) and in Zaire (1980), Tabutin in
Western Zaire (1982), Poston and his
colleagues in Mexico (1985), and Poston
and Trent (1984) in a number of developing countries. However, we suggest
that these studies are not that germane

Social Biology

for an understanding of the relationship
in Brazil because the country has been
engaged in a program of economic development for several decades.

More important for an understanding of the association between modernization and childlessness in Brazil are
prior investigations conducted in developed countries. These studies (Veevers,
1972; Poston, 1974; Cutright and Polonko, 1977; Freshnock and Cutright,
1978; among others) have indicated that
as modernization increases, fertility declines and childlessness increases; the
increases in childlessness are primarily
due to the tending of the phenomenon
to be increasingly voluntary in character. We also noted two other studies that
have demonstrated the occurrence of
this “Western” pattern in the relationship between modernization and childlessness, one in Taiwan (Poston et al.,
1984) and another among younger
women in Egypt (Poston and El-Badry,
1987).

While Brazil is usually not placed in
the same social and economic groupings
as the U.S., Canada, and the countries
of Western Europe, it is in many ways
quite similar to them with respect to
these measures. Like Taiwan, Brazil has
been actively involved in modernization
programs for several decades. We noted
above that Brazil’s economic policies
have encouraged economic development, at least since the early 1950's.
And its fertility rate has been declining
in recent years, particularly in the more
developed parts of the country. Given
these patterns, childlessness in Brazil
should therefore tend to be more voluntary than involuntary, particularly
among the younger women in the more
modernized subregions of the country.

In the analysis reported in this paper

Vol. 35, No. 3-4

we found that among the subregions of
Brazil in 1980, childlessness and levels
of modernization were positively related, especially among younger
women. This suggests the presence of
varying amounts of voluntary childlessness among these younger women.
Given this finding, we expect that as fertility continues to decline in Brazil,
these reductions should be accompanied
by further increases in the country in
voluntary childlessness.
