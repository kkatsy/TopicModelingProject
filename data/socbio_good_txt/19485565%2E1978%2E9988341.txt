ABSTRACT: From ecclesiastical and civil data on consanguinity, age at marriage, and immigration
in Chile from 1865 to 1914, comparisons between urban and rural zones are made. A random
mating deviation index is developed, and the values indicate deviation toward endogamy in both
zones. These values show an inverse relation to those of the exogamy index developed by
Freire-Maia and Freire-Maia (1963). Values in the rural zone are double those in the urban zone.
In the two zones there are no clear differences in age at marriage between consanguineous and
nonconsanguineous couples. Thus, we might expect lower fertility in consanguineous marriages
only because of a higher probability of homozygosis of deleterious genes.

Migration and inbreeding are of special
interest to population genetics. The relationship between these two evolutionary
forces has been shown by several authors
(Cavalli-Sforza, 1962; Schull and
McCluer, 1968). However, a distinction
must be made between urban and rural
areas in studying migration and inbreeding (Cavalli-Sforza, 1959). Also, our
knowledge of the genetic structure of a
population may be increased if we examine age at marriage because this parameter
is an important factor in changing fertility
patterns as well as in the growth of populations (Kiser, 1970).

In the present paper we focus on two
zones, the city of Valparaiso, the most
populated center in the province, and
Casablanca commune, a rural zone on the
outskirts of Valparaiso (Lazo et al., 1970)
to establish relationships among immigration, inbreeding, and age at marriage and
to formulate an endogamy index.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data were obtained from the records contained in the church books of the
parishes in the zones under study. Lists
were made of all consanguineous marriages in the years 1865 to 1914. Arandom
sample of nonconsanguineous marriages
was chosen from the same books so that
data on two equal-sized groups of marriages were obtained.

The period 1865-1914 was chosen for
several reasons. First of all, it is a period
long enough to permit a thorough analysis,
particularly of changes in the frequency of
migration or consanguineous marriages.
Second, the number of marriages listed in
civil and church records are very similar.
Third, after 1916, Catholic canon law
did not require the registration of dispensations for consanguineous marriages beyond the second cousins, and thus there are
no records of the relationships in such
marriages.

The following information was available for each couple: names, ages at marriage, and places of birth. For consanguineous marriages, the relationship of
bride and groom was given.

In the classification of the degree of consanguinity, the following code was used:
Type 12, marriages of uncle-niece or
aunt-nephew; Type 22, marriages of first
cousins; Type 23, marriages of first
cousins once removed; Type 33, marriages
of second cousins; and Type M, marriages
with other degrees of consanguinity.

We obtained the total number of marriages from ecclesiastical books and civil
communal administrative data. As
ecclesiastical and civil data do not coincide
exactly, we used the best information for
each year. In some cases, we used the
ecclesiastical data; in others, only the civil
data. We used official census sources to
obtain the following data for each zone:
area size in square kilometers and total
number of inhabitants.

Since civil and ecclesiastical divisions
do not coincide exactly, some villages belong to Casablanca in_ ecclesiastical
sources and to Valparaiso in civil sources.
For our study, we have included the demographic and geographic data on these
villages in the Casablanca area. Thus, we
reduce the total area of Valparaiso to its
urban radius.

To determine immigration, the couples
were classified as follows: (a) both are immigrants; (b) only the man is an immigrant; (c) only the woman is an immigrant;
(d) both are natives (nonimmigrants). In
some records, the birth places were omitted, and the data not available.

As a preliminary study of age at marriage, we distributed the individuals into
seven intervals of five years from ages
15-19 to 45 or more. We included the ten
14-year-old wives in the first interval.
Since the total number of marriages for
each year is low, we grouped the total of

Inbreeding and Immigration

229

each zone in intervals of ten years. For the
analysis of ages, we preferred to analyze
the fifty years grouped together.

It should be noted that the validity of
ecclesiastical data has been discussed by
some authors (Moroni, 1962; Lazo et al.,
1973). In the present study, some errors in
the data may exist, but we think that our
conclusions are valid.

RESULTS

Table 1 shows the following data
grouped by zones and decades: means of
density and population, nuptiality, consanguineous marriages (number, types,
frequencies, and inbreeding coefficients),
and frequencies of immigrants among consanguineous and  nonconsanguineous
couples.

All these values differ markedly between zones, Valparaiso (urban) shows a
rapid growth which may be explained by a
high frequency of immigrants. Furthermore, a higher rate of nuptiality may be
attributed to high immigration and to a
preferential immigration of young and
unmarried people.

The rural zone, Casablanca, does not
show demographic growth from 1865 to
1895. The lower values during 1895 to
1914 are caused by reduction of its area by
administrative rearrangements. The increase in density in this Jast period may be
explained more by the loss of area than by
an increase in inhabitants.

In comparing consanguinity, we can see
higher values in Casablanca. The mean
frequency of consanguineous marriages is
6.40 times greater in the rural zone. Nevertheless, the inbreeding coefficient is only
4.95. This fact may be explained by an
unequal distribution of Types 12 and
22—-35.7 per cent in the rural zone and
56.8 per cent in the urban zone. These
types make the highest contribution to the
mean inbreeding coefficient. The higher
frequencies of Types 33 and M in Casa

blanca are also characteristic of other rural
areas. The same trend has been observed
by different authors in Chile and other
countries (Moroni et al., 1972; Quezada et
al., 1973; Dolinar, 1965; Sutter and Goux,
1962).

The frequencies of consanguineous and
nonconsanguineous immigrants generally
show slow fluctuations throughout time,
although a slight decrease in the urban
zone and a slight increase in the rural zone
may be noted. On the other hand, in Valparaiso, the contribution of consanguineous couples is as important as that of nonconsanguineous couples—78.6 per cent and
78.1 per cent, respectively. In the rural
zone, the frequency of consanguineous
immigrants is approximately 50 per cent
lower than that of nonconsanguineous
immigrants, even though the mean values
of rural immigration are much lower than
those of urban immigration.

The relationship between consanguinity
and immigration is shown in the data
given in Table 2. There is a great difference between observed and expected values for consanguineous as well as for nonconsanguineous couples in both zones.
However, these differences are greater for
consanguineous couples. In every case the
higher observed values are constituted by
couples where both are natives or both are
immigrants. This fact indicates a preferential trend toward marriage between individuals of similar backgrounds. We suppose two reasons might explain it. First, a
prejudice of natives against marrying immigrants, perhaps because the native
population forms a discrete socioeconomic
unit (Boyce et al., 1967). Second, a proportion of consanguineous immigrants
came from the same place, or the future
spouses knew one another before migrating. The frequencies of couples sharing the
same birthplace (see Table 3) support this
argument.

Within Table 2, the chi-square tests give

the values of each case in the two zones,
all of which show p > 0.001 (df:1). This
analysis indicates a deviation from random mating and, in general, inbreeding
and immigration contributed to it.

Nevertheless, these contributions are unequal so that in the urban zone the mean
value of immigration is 3.79 times higher
than it is in the rural zone, but the mean
inbreeding coefficient is 4.95 times lower
in the urban zone than in the rural zone.

The mean difference between observed
and expected values divided by the total
number of marriages may be assumed to
provide a mean index of deviation from
random mating. However, before calculating such an index, we should make
two observations.

First, Table 2 shows a greater number
of immigrant males than females. Thus, a
fraction of them cannot marry an immigrant woman even if they wished to. For
this reason, the values of the deviation
from random mating must be measured in
terms of sex. For instance, on the left side
of the table we observe 848 immigrant
women and 935 men. Consequently, the
maximum number of marriages among
immigrants is 848, and this value represents the total theoretical deviation (7). On
the other hand, the expected value is
696.12, which represents the opposite
value or total theoretical random mating
(E). The number of couples observed (QO)
among immigrants is 743, and this value is
between T and E. Then, the difference T
— E may be estimated as 100 per cent of

the random mating deviation, and the difference O — E divided by T — E may be
estimated as a reasonable measure of the
deviation from random mating when immigration is present.

A second observation is about consanguineous marriage frequencies which are
2.37 (urban) and 15.18 (rural). In turn,
nonconsanguineous marriages have frequencies of 97.63 per cent (urban) and
84.82 per cent (rural). Therefore, the contribution of consanguineous and nonconsanguineous marriages to the index must
be obtained from these frequencies. The
index ([) is given by: J = 2([PO — E)\(T -—
E)], where P is the frequency and where
the sum is the contribution of consanguineous and nonconsanguineous couples.

According to this formula, the values
obtained, 17.70 for urban and 34.56 for
rural, indicate that the rural value is approximately double the urban value. We
can see the relationship between these
values and the exogamy index of FreireMaia and Freire-Maia (1963). According
to their definition, the values for the
exogamy index would be 76.44 for the
urban area and 34.60 for the rural area,
according to the frequencies of Classes 2,
3, and 4 of Table 3. As the consanguineous
marriages are endogamous by definition,
we obtained these values only from nonconsanguineous couples. The values for
the exogamy index are approximately
doubled in the urban zone and, as we expected, in inverse relation to the random
mating deviation index.

Finally, as a preliminary study of age at
marriage, we show in Table 4 the age
distribution frequencies of nonconsanguineous and consanguineous males and
females in each zone. At the foot of this
table we included the mean (X}, variance
(S?), and the variation coefficient (S/X).

Great differences are not observed between the zones, although nonconsanguineous males and females marry slightly
later, particularly nonconsanguineous
males. Variance values are greater in the
urban zone, but male variances are generally lower than female variances. In the
same way, variation coefficients are lower
in males in both zones.

In general, a higher average difference
should be expected between consanguineous couples than between nonconsan
guineous ones because marriages of Types
12 (uncle-niece) and 23 (aunt-nephew) belong to different generations. However,
the data showed similar values. Thus, we
might posit that consanguineous and nonconsanguineous mates marry at similar
ages and/or the frequencies of Types 12
(uncle-niece) and 23 (aunt-nephew) are
approximately the same.

The fact that differences in age at marriage do not exist between consanguineous
and nonconsanguineous couples is an important finding. From the point of view of
fertility, we can expect a similar length
period of fertility for consanguineous and
nonconsanguineous couples. In this case
we might expect lower fertility in consanguineous marriages only because of a
higher probability of deleterious genes.
