Neurochemical Mechanisms

ABSTRACT: Selectively bred lines of mice, such as the long sleep (LS) and short sleep (SS), are of
potential value for testing hypotheses which attempt to explain the mechanisms that underlie
the behavioral actions of alcohol. We have used the LS and SS mice to test several hypotheses,
most notably that some of the behavioral actions of alcohol are due to the formation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid, salsolinol, and that alcohol disrupts the activity of specific
membrane-bound enzymes. The results obtained support the salsolinol hypothesis and suggest
that only some membrane-bound enzymes are affected by alcohol. In view of the fact that the LS
and SS mice differ in these parameters, the general hypotheses remain viable despite the fact
that the concentrations of salsolinol and alcohol required to elicit measurable effects were large.
Therefore, these particular hypotheses can be accepted as being potential explanations for alco
hol’s actions.

Studies of neurochemical mechanisms associated with the actions of alcohol have been a major theme of research on the etiology of alcoholism. A
variety of techniques have been used to
gain insight into the interaction of alcohol with various neuronal systems in an
attempt to elucidate how such interactions may result in the development of
tolerance to and dependence on alcohol. The approach taken in our laboratory has been to combine genetic and
neurochemical studies to examine hypotheses of alcohol’s actions. We have
utilized the long-sleep (LS) and shortsleep (SS) lines of mice developed by
McClearn and Kakihana (1981). The LS
and SS mice were derived from a genetically heterogeneous stock (HS) by
means of bidirectional selective breeding using loss of the righting response

(sleep time) as the selection criterion.
The LS mice lose the righting response
10-15 times longer than do SS mice
given the same dose of alcohol (Howerton et al., 1984). Thus, these animals
represent the extremes possible in response to a challenge dose of alcohol.
The LS and SS mice exhibit modest
differences in ethanol elimination

(Gilliam and Collins, 1982; Gilliam et

al., 1983), but the primary mechanism
that underlies the difference in duration
of alcohol-induced sleep is differential
brain sensitivity to the depressant effects of alcohols (Heston et al., 1974).
This genetically determined difference
in central nervous system (CNS) sensitivity makes the LS and SS lines of mice
useful genetic tools for testing hypotheses concerning the mechanisms of alcohol’s action. In this paper, we describe

the results of a series of experiments in
which we have used the LS and SS mice
to test two popular hypotheses that have
been suggested as potential neurochemical explanations for the actions of ethanol on brain function.

and SS mice to investigate the hypothesis that salsolinol plays a role in the acute
response to alcohol. Theoretically, if
salsolinol mediates the acute response
to alcohol, then these lines of mice
should respond differentially to salsolinol treatment. In order to test the hypothesis, we examined the effects of
salsolinol on open-field activity and
body temperature, two tests which differentiate the LS and SS lines of mice

following acute alcohol treatment
(Sanders et al., 1978; Smolen and Collens, 1984). We also investigated the
ability of salsolinol to alter alcoholinduced sleep time and alcohol elimination rate. These data are summarized in
Figures 1-4.

Salsolinol was administered by injecting it into the cerebral ventricles (intracerebrally, IC) in artificial cerebral
spinal fluid (CSF) following light etherization; hence the use of ether/CSF controls. It is clear from Figures 1 and 2 that
the LS mice are more sensitive to the effects of salsolinol on open-field activity
and body temperature than are the SS
mice. Similarly, LS mice are more sensitive to the hypothermic effects of ethanol (see Fig. 2).

The ability of salsolinol to modify
alcohol-induced sleep time is shown in
Figure 3. Salsolinol significantly increased sleep time in both mouse lines.
However, the LS mice were more affected (slept longer) than SS mice.
Thus, the LS mice appear to be more
sensitive to the behavioral effects of
salsolinol than are the SS mice. The augmentation of ethanol-induced sleep
time could arise because of effects in the
CNS or because of effects on ethanol
metabolism; i.e., salsolinol could enhance ethanol-induced sleep time either
by affecting the CNS or by affecting ethanol metabolism. Figure 4 presents the
results of an experiment in which the effects of salsolinol pretreatment on ethanol elimination were assessed in the LS
and SS mice. Salsolinol pretreatment
did not alter the alcohol elimination rate
in either mouse line. This suggests that
the increase in alcohol-induced sleep
time seen following salsolinol administration is due to an alteration in CNS
sensitivity to alcohol and not to an effect

on alcohol metabolism. These findings
support the hypothesis that salsolinol
may play a role in eliciting the acute behavioral effects of ethanol.

In an effort to identify the cause of
the differential sensitivity to salsolinol
seen in the LS and SS mice, we investigated whether the lines differed in the
rate of disappearance of salsolinol from
brain. The results of this experiment can
be seen in Figure 5. The disappearance
of salsolinol from brain following IC injection follows first-order reaction ki
netics. The half-lives were calculated
from the first-order kinetic constant and
found to be 12.8 min for LS and 12.3 min
for SS mice. These half-lives are nearly
identical to those calculated by Melchior

et al. (1980) for the disappearance of

salsolinol from rat brain following intraventricular injection. These data argue that the LS-SS difference in response to IC-injected salsolinol is not
due to differences in elimination of
salsolinol but due to differential CNS
sensitivity to the drug.

brain allowed us to monitor concurrently the brain levels of norepinephrine
and dopamine following salsolinol injection. This was of interest because of reports suggesting that salsolinol increases
the release of these amines (Smolen et
al., 1984). Both alcohol and salsolinol

interact with neurotransmitter systems
in a highly complex manner. Many of
the behavioral effects produced by these
drugs could be attributable to alternations in catecholamine systems (Church
et al., 1977; Awazi and Guldber, 1979).
Salsolinol, however, did not affect
whole brain levels of dopamine in either
mouse line, and only a modest reduction

_in norepinephrine levels was detected in

LS mice 20 min after salsolinol treatment. Further studies are necessary to
assess the importance of this finding.

function. However, it does not seem
likely that salsolinol elicits its behavioral
effects by altering brain levels of the catecholamine neurotransmitters.

Other measures of catecholamine
function are probably more enlightening than is the measurement of whole
brain levels. Several lines of evidence
have suggested that, compared to other
neurotransmitter systems, the dopaminergic system is quite sensitive to
both alcohol and salsolinol (Carlsson et
al., 1973; Deitrich and Erwin, 1975;

Hoffman and Tabakoff, 1977; Awazi
and Guldber, 1979). Therefore, we examined the effects of these drugs on dopamine uptake by striatal synaptosomes. The striatal area was chosen
because it is the area of the CNS richest
in dopamine. Figure 6 shows the effect
of in vitro alcohol on dopamine uptake.
Eight concentrations of alcohol ranging
from 0.25 per cent to 5.0 per cent (v/v)
were tested. The effects of alcohol on

take, the concentrations required are
outside the physiological range (0.25—
1.0 per cent). The observations that very
high concentrations of ethanol were required to inhibit dopamine uptake and
that the LS and SS were affected similarly argue that ethanol does not elicit its
behavioral effects by altering the reuptake of dopamine unless some metabolite of ethanol alters dopamine uptake in
vivo,

In similar in vitro experiments, eight
concentrations of salsolinol ranging

from 1 micromolar to 3 millimolar were
evaluated for their ability to inhibit dopamine uptake (see Fig. 7). Dopamine
uptake was significantly inhibited by
salsolinol. Furthermore, a three-fold
difference between the LS and SS mice
was seen in their ICsp values (that concentration which inhibits the uptake by
50 per cent). This finding suggests that
the difference in behavioral response to
salsolinol between the LS and SS mice
may be due to differences in the effects
of this agent on dopamine uptake. HowVol. 32, No. 34 Genetics of Alcohol Phenotypes 263

ever, the effects of salsolinol on do"spamine uptake were seen only at very
ohigh concentrations. Therefore, unless
Asalsolinol affects dopamine uptake at
lower concentrations in vivo, the hypothesis that salsolinol elicits its behavioral effects by inhibiting dopamine uptake must be accepted with caution.

In summary, the results of these experiments are supportive of a role for
salsolinol in the actions of alcohol, although the nature of the role is as yet undetermined. Nevertheless, studies of
salsolinol’s actions may provide some

wnloaded b

insight into the mechanisms by which alcohol exerts its effects.

ALCOHOL-MEMBRANE
INTERACTIONS

Of all the hypotheses concerning the
mechanism of alcohol’s actions, that
which has gained the widest acceptance
is the belief that alcohol exerts its pharmacological effects by disrupting cell
membranes and thereby altering membrane function. This is not a new concept; in the early 1900’s Overton (1901)
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

and Meyer (1901) observed that the potencies of anesthetic drugs were directly
proportional to their lipid solubilities.
They theorized that such drugs had to
function in a lipid environment, presumably the cell membrane.

The cell membrane consists of a
phospholipid bilayer containing cholesterol and proteins (Singer and Nicolson,
1972). The membrane proteins are of
several types and are embedded to various depths: Peripheral proteins are
loosely attached to the surface, whereas
integral proteins are deeply embedded
and may even penetrate the bilayer.
These proteins serve a multitude of
functions. Some of the proteins function
as channels through which ions can pass;
others are receptor molecules. AIthough some of the proteins are
membrane-bound enzymes, others act
as carriers or pumps, e.g., sodiumpotassium adenosine triphosphatase
(Na-K ATPase) which pumps Na* out
and K* into the cell in order to maintain

. anormal ion gradient between the inte
rior and exterior parts of the cell. This is
particularly important in nerves, in
which Na-K ATPase functions to restore the membrane potential after a series of action potentials.

The cell membrane is not rigid;
rather, the lipids are in a semifluid state
and considerable movement is possible
(Goldstein, 1984). The fluidity of membranes can be studied using a variety of
techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron paramagnetic
spin resonance (ESR), and fluorescence
polarization (FP). All of these methods
have been used to show that alcohol disorders or increases the fluidity of the
membrane lipids, a phenomenon believed to be a primary mechanism by
which alcohol elicits its effects.

Smolen and Collins

Social Biology

Goldstein et al. (1982) have used
ESR to study the effects of alcohol on
biomembranes isolated from laboratory
animals. ESR measures the absorption
of energy by a spin label probe (an unpaired electron). The probe is attached
to a compound that can be taken up into
a membrane, and the motion of the
compound in the membrane is recorded. This yields an ESR spectrum
from which one can calculate an order
parameter (S), a quantity that indicates
the degree of rigidity of a membrane.
The order parameter has values of 0-1
(completely fluid—completely rigid).
Following chronic exposure to alcohol
an adaptation occurs within the lipid
portion of the affected biological membrane. Goldstein’s group has demonstrated that membranes obtained from
mice that have been treated chronically
with alcohol show tolerance to the membrane fluidizing effects of alcohol as
measured by ESR techniques. Such
changes are sometimes referred to as
homeoviscous adaptation and appear to
be due to an increase in cholesterol
which serves to increase the rigidity of
the membrane. Goldstein and coworkers have found that membranes isolated from mice treated chronically with
alcohol are resistant to the effects of alcohol compared to controls and that
membranes isolated from the brains of
these animals have a higher cholesterolphospholipid ratio compared to the
membranes of control mice. In addition,
Goldstein’s group has demonstrated
that membranes obtained from SS mice
are fluidized less by alcohol than are LS
membranes and that this difference is
not easily explained by differences in
membrane lipids (Goldstein et al.,
1982). Thus, an argument can be made
that alcohol exerts its effects by altering

membrane fluidity and that differences
in behavioral response to alcohol may
be correlated with these alterations.
While there is considerable support
for the hypothesis that alcohol exerts its
effects on the brain (and consequently
behavior) by altering the fluidity of
membranes, our knowledge of precisely
which membrane-mediated processes
are affected is rudimentary. We do not
know, for example, if alcohol affects the
activity of all membrane-bound enzymes or only some; i.e., is there any
specificity in alcohol’s action? One way
in which the effects of alcohol on activity

 

 

of membrane-bound enzymes can be
studied is to assess its effects on lipid
phase transitions. Lipids can exist in the
membrane bilayers as fluids or as gels.
Cell membranes are a mixture of fluid
and solid phases at physiological temperatures. As temperature changes, the
relative proportion of the phases will
shift. This shift may affect the functioning of the proteins in that membranebound enzymes may function differently
above and below the transition temperature. This would be expected if the fluidity of the membrane was important to
enzyme function. The phase transition

of an enzyme can be determined from
an Arrhenius plot of the enzyme activity. An Arrhenius plot is a plot of the
logarithm of enzyme activity vs 1/
absolute temperature. As the temperature is varied, a change in the slope of
the line is seen from some enzymes. This
change in slope represents a phase transition in the region of the membrane
that affects the enzyme.

The relationship between membrane
fluidization and the functioning of
membrane-bound proteins has been
somewhat vague. We have attempted to
investigate this relationship by measuring the activity of five membrane-bound

 

enzymes at various temperatures in order to determine whether or not alcohol
has any specificity tn its actions on
membrane-bound enzymes in the LS
and SS mice. The enzymes studied include three different ATPases, 5’nucleotidase (an integral glycoprotein),
and acetylcholinesterase (AChE, a peripheral membrane enzyme whose ac

al., 1984; A. C. Collins et al., 1984). The

ase is the most sensitive to ouabain inhibition, the high K; enzyme is less sensitive, and Mg-ATPase is insensitive to
ouabain. The low K; enzyme has been
largely ignored in the past. However,
the fact that it may be found exclusively
in neuronal tissues (Marks and Seeds,
1978; Sweadner, 1979) suggests that it
may be the most important of the three
ATPases.

In order to study the effects of alcohol on phase transition in the lipid core
of the membrane, enzyme activity was
measured as a function of temperature
in the presence or absence of alcohol.
Arrhenius plots of these data are presented in Figures 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. In

these figures, a break in the slope of the
line represents a change in lipid phase.
For both AChE (Fig. 8) and 5 nucleotidase (Fig. 9), the transition temperatures
were not significantly altered by alcohol.
Mg-ATPase (Fig. 10) showed no transition and does not appear to be affected
by alcohol. No significant differences
were detected between the LS and SS
mice with respect to these three enzymes. Similarly, the two lines of mice

ohol has on reducing the transition
emperature of the low K; Na-K ATPase
see Figs. 11 and 12). Alcohol reduced
the transition temperature 7°C in the LS
line compared to 4°C in the SS line. The
magnitude of this difference agrees almost perfectly with previous reports by
Goldstein’s group on LS and SS differences in order parameters (Goldstein et
al., 1982). These data suggest that alcohol does have specificity in its actions
since, of the five enzymes studied, only
the low K; Na-K ATPase was uniquely
affected. Further studies of the effects of
alcohol on this membrane-bound enzyme may provide information concern

disrupts membrane function and

In summary, our data support the hypotheses that alteration of the activity of
the low K; Na-K: ATPase is involved in
the behavioral effects elicited by an
acute dose of alcohol. This effect probably involves a disruption of the interactions between the lipids surrounding the
enzyme, and the enzyme protein. The
fact that only one of the five enzymes
studied was differentially affected by
ethanol indicates that a better understanding of the effects of ethanol on
membranes will be obtained only by

CONCLUSIONS

The use of the LS and SS mice to test
our hypotheses resulted in support for
the hypotheses that salsolinol and the
low K; Na-K ATPase may be involved in
alcohol’s actions, whereas the hypotheses that alcohol elicits its behavioral effects by altering the activities of AChE,
5-nucleotidase, Mg-ATPase, or the low
K; Na-K ATPase were not supported.
As is the case with virtually every

method available today, the use of genetic tools, such as the LS and SS mice,
to test hypotheses cannot be viewed as
providing definitive proof of an hypothesis. Rather, support for an hypothesis
only permits us to continue to accept the
hypothesis as a potential explanation.
Other tests and considerations must be
included before any hypothesis can be
accepted. For example, for both our
salsolinol and ATPase studies, extraordinarily high concentrations were required to observe a measurable effect in
vitro. Unless the systems we studied are
more sensitive in vivo, the possibility
that alcohol’s actions involve salsolinol
270

formation or alteration of the interactions between the ATPase enzyme and
its surrounding lipids must be viewed
with some pessimism. Nonetheless, the
results obtained with these systems provide some encouragement and suggest
that further experiments may provide
data that will be of value in understanding the mechanisms by which alcohol
elicits its acute behavioral effects.
