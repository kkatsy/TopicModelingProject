Most of the many early anthropologic
studies of Hindu society were done in North
Indian villages where strong taboos exist
against inbreeding. Therefore, the prevailing
concept of Indian marriage patterns is that
of carefully arranged marriages which rule
out consanguinity. Only a few more recent
reports have focused special attention on the
consanguineous marriage patterns of South
India (Dronamraju and Khan, 1963; Sivertsen, 1963; Centerwall and Centerwall,
1966; Sanghvi, 1966). It is interesting that
many North Indian doctors and others of
the scientific community in that country do
not know that the southern customs are so
different and tend to view reports of such
frequent and close inbreeding with amazement, if not disbelief.

Routine family histories of sick children
brought to the Christian Medical College
in Vellore, South India, revealed that close
consanguineous marriage was indeed the
custom of these families, The first investigation of consanguinity which was done at

that hospital was a study of the relationship
of consanguinity to congenital defects in
children seen in the pediatric outpatient
clinic and in the newborn nursery (Centerwall and Centerwall, 1966). The amount of
close consanguinity among the parents of
3,433 outpatient cases and 1,037 newborn
babies studied was unexpectedly high, being
approximately 45% and 37%, respectively,
of these parents.

Several circumstances of the first study
led the authors to the study which is reported here. The population in the first
study was self-selected by coming to the
hospital for medical care. Secondly, the
marriage relationships had been recorded
according to the parent’s report without taking family pedigrees. Thirdly, the
amount of consanguinity which we reported
was regarded with both interest and skepticism. Therefore, we decided to do careful
pedigrees of a representative sample of families in a “typical”? South Indian village for
the purpose of reporting accurately the marriage customs of such a group. To our knowledge, no comparable study exists.

The village of Kavanur was chosen because of the comprehensive rural health program already established there by the De

partment of Community Health of the
Christian Medical College in Vellore. A resident doctor with an intern assistant, a pharmacist, and a group of public health nurses
staff a small hospital and an outpatient service. The nurses deliver almost all the babies
in the area, which is a measure of the good
rapport they have with the families.
Kavanur is situated about fifteen miles
northwest of Vellore (see Fig. 1). It is two
miles off the main road between Katpadi
and Gudiyattam, near the border between
the states of Madras and Andhra. It is an
independent, agricultural community, typical of the villages in which the majority of
the people of Madras State live. Crops can

be raised throughout the year, including
rice, peanuts, bananas, and sugar cane.
Most of the people either work their own
land, rent land, or are wage-laborers. There
are a few shopkeepers. All people of the village speak Tamil, the indigenous Dravidian
language of Madras State. In addition, a
fair-sized minority can handle Telegu, a
sister Dravidian tongue of the nearby state
of Andhra Pradesh. The small Muslim group
also are fluent in Urdu (essentially the same
as spoken Hindustani, but with a Persian
script), the language of the followers of
Mohammed throughout South Asia. A few
well-educated men have a command of

language. While the facts of Kavanur do
not fit all peoples and situations in South
India, we feel that this village is, by geographical location, cultural patterns, size
and composition, almost a classic model of a
rural, Dravidian, South Indian village.

METHOD OF STUDY

Each household was visited by a team of
two Indian doctors who were doing the
Community Health portion of their internship. At least one member of each pair was a
female and at least one was fluent in the local language, Tamil. The other team member was conversant with Tamil and served
as the recorder. The interviewers had been
instructed in the art of pedigree-taking, and
preliminary trial interviews were done under
the supervision of the main author. Most
pedigrees linked together several households and information was obtained from
more than one informant. However, when
one informant seemed to have accurate
information about an adjacent household of
a close relative, no check was made of the
information unless there was a point in
doubt. The time spent with each informant
varied considerably, but averaged about an
hour.

Various pitfalls in determining consanguineous relationships had been discovered
in earlier pedigree work in the same geographic area. A confusion of affinal (in-law)
relationships with blood relationships occurred occasionally when there were several
links with another family. In such cases it
seemed probable that there had been a blood
relationship at some time in the past. The
lack of near relationship was revealed by plotting the pedigree as it was taken. Even when
an informant was quite certain that a specific marriage was between blood relatives but
was unable to describe exactly the nature of
the relationship, such marriages, though
marked in a special way in the pedigree,
were not included in the data.

Most confusing were the South Indian

peculiarities of naming of relatives. A
“brother” might mean a true brother or a
“cousin-brother” (actually the father’s
brother’s child, a first cousin), Similarly, a
“niece” might mean the sister’s daughter or
it could mean the ‘‘cousin-brother’s” daughter (actually a first cousin once removed).
The method used for checking on the actual
relationship was to include all the names
when taking and plotting the original pedigree.

DATA AND RESULTS

At the time of this study there were a
total of 1,447 people living in 321 households
(an average of 4.5 persons per house). Twenty-four family pedigrees were obtained involving 12 castes! and 117 houses (see Fig. 2).
Table 1 gives the total number of households in each caste and the number and per
cent that were included in the pedigrees
obtained. An attempt was made to include
families from all castes living in the village.
This resulted in a total or near-total sampling of some caste groups with minimal
representation in the village, such as the
Brahmins, Dhobies, and Muslims, and a
considerably lesser proportion of certain
larger caste groups such as the Harijans and
Naickers (see Table 1). Those homes without an adult informant available were bypassed, but only 21 households were left unidentified as to caste.

The Brahmin, represented by only one
household in the village, was by tradition
the most prestigious member of Hindu society. He was a landlord as well as the authority on ritual. Those who were virtually his
social equal were the other landowners, the
Veerasivams, Mudaliars, and Chettiars.
The headman of the village was a Chettiar.
The more typical peasant members of the

society were the tenant farmers: the Acharies, Naickers, and Nadars. The Dhobies
were the washermen. Some of the Harijans,
former Untouchables, worked small plots of
rented land, but usually they were day
laborers, cobblers, or did other menial tasks
for the upper-caste families.

typical pedigree in the village. In all, 871
marriages were plotted in the 24 family

* When members of a household knowledgeably included in
their family pedigree members of other households in the village, such other households were considered as having been included in the survey. However, the only marriages included in
the final consanguinity analysis were those of the informants
and children of informants,

came apparent that when informants did
not know the exact consanguineous relationship of a marriage, they often would say
that there was no such relationship rather
than admit they did not know—even though
answers of doubt were perfectly acceptable
to the interviewers (though such marriages
were not included in the final calculations).
This fact was borne out in later analyses of
the pedigrees where the rate of consanguinity was found to decrease as the informant
described the marriages of more distant
relatives. Even the marriages of the informants’ siblings and parents were recorded

Social Biology

with one-third and two-thirds lower consanguinity rates respectively than those of
the informants themselves or of their own
children (whose marriages they customarily
arrange). Therefore, for the final analyses of
consanguinity rates and coefficients of inbreeding, only 92 marriages were used,
i.e., the 47 marriages of informants (pedigree sources) and the 45 (arranged) marriages of their children, because only information on these marriages was considered of
maximum reliability.

The coefficient of inbreeding of a particular mating is the chance that both parties
carry a specific gene from a common ancestor, e.g., for first cousin mating it is 1/16
or 0.0625. Table 2 lists “‘coefficient of inbreeding” values and symbols for the different types of consanguineous unions. Table 3
includes a “gross” breakdown of the 92
marriages by type and frequency. Nearly
half (47.8%) of the marriages were between
relatives, with more than 10% of all marriages taking place between a man and his
sister’s daughter. These consanguineous
couples often are even more closely inbred
than the table implies. A complex network
of inbreeding means that frequently several
relationships exist simultaneously in the
same marriage. For example, in the Naicker
pedigree portrayed in Figures 3 and 4, the
“uncle-niece” marriage involving the son of
one of the informants is not only “uncleniece” but also a 24 cousin (called second
cousin once removed) and also a 3% cousin
(or third cousin once removed) marriage.
This sort of close inbreeding yields an exceptionally high inbreeding coefficient of
0.0351 for the 92 marriages.

In Figure 4 the pedigrees of the village
have been skeletonized or reduced in order
to demonstrate easily the nature and complexity of the consanguinity involved in
these 92 marriages. Table 4 puts values on
these 44 consanguineous unions with development of consanguinity rates and coefhcients of inbreeding. The significance of this

Table 1). Families of the same cast tend to live close together; so, in most instances, the castes of the blank
‘not surveyed” households are the same as for nearby identified ones. Surrounding the village are rice
paddies with some acreage put into sugar cane and groundnut (peanut) production. Within a one and a half
mile radius of Kavanur are four similar but somewhat smaller villages, and four or five miles away is a
larger town with movie theater and bazaar.

can be understood by comparison with theoretical situations. If, in an hypothetical
population, all marriages in a particular
generation are between first cousins, the inbreeding coefficient will be 0.0625. If all
marriages are between first cousins once removed (1% cousins), the coefficient of inbreeding will be 0.0313. Kavanur village
falls between the two and is among the highest yet reported for a population. The coefficient of inbreeding of a population is merely
an average of coefficients for all marriages.

the caste is like a clan. The degree of interrelationship differs markedly throughout
the country. In the South, the marriage customs are patterned after those of the original
Indians, or Dravidians, who were pushed to
the south, and are characterized by marriage
between close relatives. In the North there
are rules that prevent such marriages. The
origin of these rules of exogamy in the North
is not known. It is commonly stated that
Hindus of the North cannot marry anyone
who is related to them within five or even
seven generations, and often that they cannot marry within their own village. For all
intents, one may assume that there is no
consanguinity among most northern Hindus.

Such rules of exogamy (as in North India)
have apparently had little effect on the traditional customs in the Dravidian South.
The rules of caste are as firmly, if not more
firmly, established than in the North. Perhaps the sizes of the castes are smaller, making marriage choices more limited; and this
may have helped to perpetuate the ancient
pattern of consanguineous marriage. In
most Hindu communities of the South a
first cousin marriage is a preferred union,
and in some it is the reserved right of the
younger brother to marry the older sister’s
daughter (uncle-niece marriage). This marriage pattern has been explained as the traditional way of seeing that property that
went to an elder sister by ancient matrilineal custom actually passed on to her
brother.

In other ways, however, the Hindu communities of South India today have a typical, extended, patrilineal-patrilocal structure, and marriage patterns observe the
significance of this joint-family setting.
This means that a man and his brother with
their wives and children live together under
the father’s roof or in adjacent households.
The brothers are all ‘fathers’ to the children and the children are all “brothers and
sisters” to each other. The children will call

 

 

Inbreeding in India 89

their father’s older brother, ‘‘big father,”
and his younger brother, “little father.”
None of the people in this group will marry
each other. But the brother’s sisters will be
living in various other households, often in
different villages. Compared with the close
feeling that the members of one household
have for each other, these aunts and their
children do not seem so closely related. The
father’s sister is called ‘‘aunt”’ and the mother’s brother is called “uncle.” Figure 5
shows examples of the kinds of consanguineous marriages which are common and acceptable.

SUMMARY

A representative village population of rural South India was determined to have an
exceptionally high consanguinity rate of
47.8% and a coefficient of inbreeding of
0.0351. This is a conservative estimate, both
because of the strictness of criteria requiring
informant’s knowledge as to the exact
“blood relationship” involved and because
sample bias includes a greater proportion of
the less-numerous, less-consanguineous, upper castes.

There is reason to believe from other
studies (Dronamraju and Khan, 1963;
Centerwal]l and Centerwall, 1966; Sanghvi,
1966) that a high rate of inbreeding exists
throughout most of Dravidian South India
with a population in excess of 110 million.
This area thus provides an exceptional
opportunity for studying the biological
effects of consanguinity in populations and
also the occurrence in specific families of
congenital deformities, miscarriages, still
births, postnatal mortality, and fertility.
It may be possible to learn more about the
genetic role (or lack thereof) in specific,
heretofore puzzling disorders. For example,
if the parents of a collection of persons with
disease “‘X”’ are found to have a much higher rate of inbreeding than do those of a control group or the general population from
which the cases are obtained, this would sug

gest that hereditary factors are involved to
some degree in the production of that disease.

Finally, knowledge of the high inbreeding
rate in South India is valuable, in a practical way, for genetic counseling. In India,
most marriages are still arranged by the
parents. Such marriages usually are the result of much deliberation and a careful

expected to have a measurable effect upon
this ancient cultural custom of South India—except perhaps in producing a slow
initial move away from this pattern by the
more educated segments of society. If time
brings increasing migration and mobility to
villagers in South India, these factors would
work towards a non-contrived lessening of
consanguinity.

SOME ACCEPTABLE PATTERNS OF CONSANGUINITY
IN SOUTH INDIA

 

Fic. 5.—The most frequent type of consanguinity (inbreeding) is between cross-cousins, preferably

matrilateral, i.e., between a man and his mother’s brother’s daughter (III 10-III 11 above), with patrilateral
unions acceptable but less common. Occasionally a parallel cousin union between children of sisters is encountered, but this usually is frowned upon. The taboo is strong against the parallel cousin marriage between children of brothers. Similarly, a man may marry his sister’s daughter (II 3-III 4 above) but never
his brother’s daughter (see text for explanation). The cultural acceptance of high consanguinity rates bridges
practically all socioeconomic classes and religions in South India, occasionally with some modifications.
For example, we found less restriction amongst the Muslims regarding marriages between parallel cousins

and a general avoidance of uncle-niece unions.

agreed upon after discussions between
heads of households. This deliberate and
relatively unemotional approach lends itself
well to prophylactic, genetic counseling.
Once a hereditary disease is known to exist
in a family, one can predict the pattern of
inheritance and advise families about low
and high risk prospects. In the absence of a
specific disorder on which to focus, knowledge of the empirical, overall, increased
risks associated with consanguinity is not
