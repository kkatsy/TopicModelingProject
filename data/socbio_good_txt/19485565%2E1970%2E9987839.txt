Education and Religion as Factors Influencing
Attitudes Toward Population Growth

in the United States

Larry D. Barnett

Department of Sociology
California State College
Los Angeles, California

In 1964, Lincoln and Alice Day charged
in their book Too Many Americans that
“arguments in favor of continued population
increase [in the United States] predominate
to such an extent that they suggest the
existence of an ‘American Fertility Cult.’ ”
Today, one gets the impression that this is
not true; but relatively little research has
been conducted on the question and on the
factors which are responsible for whether
attitudes are favorable or unfavorable to
further population growth.

In fact, the writer was able to locate only
four studies which dealt with the views of
Americans toward the growth of their popuJation. The earliest study (Misra, 1967),
carried out in a Chicago slum area about
1963, was based on a sample of Negro husbands having at least one child and whose
wives were under 45 years of age; husbands
with at least one year of high school were
more likely than those with less education
to feel that population growth in the United
States was a current problem which should
be actively dealt with. In contrast to the
limited population of this survey, the remaining three studies were national public
opinion polls conducted by The Gallup

 

Organization. Two of these were sponsored
by the Population Council; one was carried
out in 1965 and the other in 1967. Each
found that 54% of the sample believed the
rate at which the U.S. population was growing constituted a “serious problem.” The
1965 survey (Berelson, 1966) found both
education and religion were related to the
extent of concern with population growth;
specifically, the view that the population
growth rate was a serious problem became
more prevalent as education increased, and
was held substantially more frequently
among non-Catholics (57%) than Catholics
(44%). In the 1967 survey, however, the
difference between educational levels was
nonexistent, while the difference between
Catholics (52%) and non-Catholics (55%)
had shrunk to only one-fourth its previous
size (Kantner, 1968). The final survey, conducted in January, 1969, was sponsored by
the National Wildlife Federation. In response to a question on whether it would be
necessary at some time to limit population
size in order to maintain present standards
of living, 44% responded affirmatively.
Those with college experience were twice as
likely as those with only a grade school edu

cation to consider population limitation
necessary; no breakdown was provided by
religion (The Gallup Organization, 1969).

With one exception, the four studies did
not attempt to assess through multivariate
analysis whether education and/or religion
are causes of attitudes toward U.S. population growth; rather, the data analysis ceased
after instituting a control for one variable at
a time.! Moreover, all of the studies relied
on a Single direct question to measure views
on U.S. population growth. They did not
investigate the degree of acceptance of the
various arguments that have been advanced
for (and against) continued population
growth and the possibility that the individual’s position on these arguments might
be the manifestation of one underlying attitude. The present study attempts to help
correct these deficiencies.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

To measure attitudes toward population
growth, five statements representing the
major arguments which have been used both
for and against further population growth
were developed and incorporated into a
questionnaire. For responding to each statement, respondents were offered the following five alternatives: Strongly Agree, Agree,
Don’t Know, Disagree, and Strongly Disagree. The five statements were, in the order
of their presentation:

1. America does not have to worry about
having too large a population, because science will always find ways to easily and
comfortably accommodate more people.

2. Unless America adds to her population,
she will be in danger of being overpowered
by overpopulated and aggressive countries
like Red China.

3. America is rapidly reaching a point where
she’ll have too many people, and this coming overpopulation is one of the greatest

1In the 1965 survey, Catholics and non-Catholics were compared under a control for education as
to the extent to which the population growth rate
was felt to be a serious problem; the difference between the two religious groups held up on every
educational level (Berelson, 1966).

Population Growth 27

threats today to the future social and
economic well-being of the country.

4, With all the open space in this country,
there cannot be a problem of overpopulation.

5. Unless America’s population continues
growing there will be a serious economic
depression.”

A copy of the questionnaire containing
these statements was to be given to, completed by, and picked up from all women 18
years of age and over who were resident at
selected addresses in Flagstaff, Arizona
(population, 27,500). Addresses were selected via a systematic sampling procedure
from the latest available City Directory and
from a supplement developed after the
directory was compiled. In addition, in
order to obtain a random sampling of
addresses that were not listed in the City
Directory because of error, a linking procedure was employed (Kish, 1965).°

A total of 635 eligible individuals were
found to reside at the addresses selected.
From this total, 462 usable questionnaires
were obtained, a completion rate of 73%.
There were refusals from 18%, and 9% did
not complete the questionnaire because of
illness, physical impairment, illiteracy, or
because they were out of town at the time
of the survey, which was conducted over
a five-week period during the fall of 1967.

2 To score the responses to each item, the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were assigned to the alternatives. For all statements except the third, the number 1 was assigned to Strongly Agree, the number 2
to Agree, the number 3 to Don’t Know, the number
4 to Disagree, and the number 5 to Strongly Disagree. In the case of the third statement, the numbers
were assigned in reverse order, with 5 to Strongly
Agree, 4 to Agree, 3 to Don’t Know, 2 to Disagree,
and 1 to Strongly Disagree.

The statements were thus scored so that the more
the respondent felt further population growth was
not desirable or necessary, the higher was the score.

? Tt should be noted that the City Directory was
organized alphabetically by name of street rather
than being organized by area. This provides greater
confidence in the existence of a randomized list of
population elements and thus in the systematic
sampling procedure being equivalent to simple random sampling, a necessary condition for the application of the inductive statistical tests employed in the
data analysis.

RESULTS

As pointed out in footnote 2, the responses to the statements were scored so
that the higher the score, the more the respondent felt that further population growth
in the United States was undesirable and
unnecessary. For each of the five statements,
the proportion of respondents considering
a larger population to be undesirable or unnecessary (score 4 or 5), the proportion indicating that continued population growth
was either not a problem or was desirable or
necessary (score 1 or 2), and the proportion

five statements in order to obtain an indication whether there is a single attitude underlying reactions to the statements. The coefficient was computed by dividing respondents into two groups, those with a score of
4 or 5 on an item and those with a score of
1, 2, or 3.4 The coefficient was 0.928.

The distribution of respondents between
the two groups, i.e., the marginals, deviated
from equality, which tends to produce a
large coefficient and make it a less meaningful measure of whether just one attitude is
being assessed; but the coefficient of repro

reacting with a ‘Don’t Know” response
(score 3) are given in Table 1.

From Table 1, it can be seen that the
current study’s respondents appear similar
to Americans generally as sampled in the
national polls in the extent to which they
view continued U.S. population growth as a
problem. The four statements presenting
arguments in favor of population growth
(statements 1, 2, 4, and 5) were rejected by
at least two-thirds of the respondents; the
one argument against further population
growth (statement 3) was accepted by 56%.
The majority of this study’s respondents,
then, like the majority of Americans, are not
unconcerned with continued population
increase in the United States.

The Guttman coefficient of reproducibility was computed for the responses to the

ducibility by chance, that is, the coefficient
that the obtained marginals would have
been produced simply by chance if the items
were statistically independent (Riley, 1963)
was just 0.110. That the actual coefficient
was far larger than would have been obtained by chance from the marginals further
suggests the five statements tap a single
attitude.

Moreover, the administration of the
statements to adult women residents of a
low-income housing project in another study
(Barnett and Griffith, 1970) yielded a coefficient of reproducibility of 0.913, a comparatively equal distribution of respondents

4 There were 23 respondents who failed to give a
response to one or more of the five statements. Con
sequently, the number of cases on which the coefficient was calculated was 439,

between the two groups, and a coefficient of
reproducibility of 0.121.5 Thus it was assumed the statements in fact measure just
one underlying attitude, and the remainder
of the analysis will not be concerned with
the responses to each statement separately;
rather, a mean attitude score calculated
from the numbers 1 through 5 assigned to
the responses to the five statements will be
used as the measure of the dependent variable.

Tables 2 and 3 present the mean attitude
scores by educational level and by religious
affiliation. In each subgroup the mean attitude score appears in the first row, the number of cases from which the score was computed appears in parentheses immediately
below, and the significance level of the difference between the means—computed via the
¢ test for comparisons between two means
and via analysis of variance for comparisons
between three or more means—is given in
the third row. Where the significance level
is above 0.10, the symbol NS is used to
designate a nonsignificant difference; where
the significance level is at or below 0.10
but above 0.05, NS appears with the significance level in parentheses.

According to the data in Table 2, educational level by itself significantly differentiates individuals in terms of attitudes;
specifically, the feeling that continued
population growth is undesirable and unnecessary becomes more prevalent (mean
attitude score increases) as educational level
rises. Even with religion® and age controlled,
educational level appears to influence atti
5 In this study, an attempt was made to contact
all women residents of the project who were 18 years

of age and older. A total of 134 respondents were
obtained, representing a completion rate of 86.5%.

6 The category, Protestant, was constructed for
the data analysis by combining into a single group
those individuals selecting Baptist, Methodist,
Lutheran, Presbyterian, Episcopalian, and Other
Protestant. Those indicating they belonged to the
Mormon Church were not classified as Protestants.
The category Jewish was not included among the
alternatives as virtually no members of this faith
live in Flagstaff.

tude independently. However, controlling
simultaneously for religion and frequency of
church attendance eliminates the relationship between education and attitude except
among (1) Protestants attending church at
least once a month and (2) Catholics attending church weekly. Among such persons,
those not having gone beyond high school
tend to accept a view favoring further
population growth more than those with at
Jeast some schooling after high school.
However, Protestant high school graduates
attending church weekly accept this view
the least. Controlling for income, the relationship between education and attitude
exists only among those reporting a family
income of under $4,000 or from $6,000 to
$7,999,

The data in Table 2 thus indicate that
educational level independently influences
attitude only among Protestants who attend
church at least once a month, Catholics who
attend church every week, and those whose
annual income (in 1966 dollars) is either
under $4,000 or $6,000-$7,999.

With regard to religious affiliation, Table
3 indicates that Protestants are more likely
than Catholics to consider further population growth undesirable and unnecessary in
the United States.’? This difference was
found in each of the three categories of
church attendance and in three of the four
age categories. Under a control for education, the difference between Protestants and
Catholics appeared only among respondents
with no more than a high school education;
when education and frequency of church attendance were controlled simultaneously,
the difference appeared among those with

7 The mean attitude score among Mormons was
3.68, while the score among those indicating their
religious affiliation as “none” was 3.75. The ¢ test
was applied to the difference between the mean
scores of Protestants and Mormons, Protestants and
those with no religious affiliation, Catholics and
Mormons, Catholics and those with no religious affilation, and Mormons and those with no religious
affiliation. None of these ¢ tests was significant at
even the 0.10 level.

no more than a high-school education who
attended church either every week or every
couple of months or less. Finally, under a
control for income, the difference between
the two faiths existed only among those with
an income of at least $10,000.

Thus, Table 3 indicates that religious
affiliation has an influence on attitude
toward further population growth among
those whose education went no further than
high school graduation as well as among
those whose income (in 1966) was $10,000
or more. The relationship between education and attitudes was examined among
Protestants and Catholics who possess both
of the preceding characteristics; Protestants
(N = 23) were found to have a mean attitude score of 4.08 and Catholics (N = 17) a
mean attitude score of 3.42, the ¢ test being
significant at beyond the 0.001 level.

DISCUSSION

In 1960, Philip Hauser levelled at Americans the accusation that, “blinded by the
short-run gains of national resurgence in
population growth, we fail to see its shortrange deleterious effects, and ignore its insidious consequences for the longer run”
(p. 65). The findings of the present study
suggest that this accusation is no longer
completely correct. As Table 1 shows, none
of the four arguments favoring continued
population growth in the United States was
accepted by more than one out of seven respondents. And perhaps more telling, 56%
of the respondents agreed with the statement that “America is rapidly reaching a
point where she’ll have too many people,
and this coming overpopulation is one of the
greatest threats today to the future social
and economic well-being of the country.”

This 1s consistent with the two Population Council surveys of American public
opinion on U.S. population growth; both
found that 54% of the respondents considered the growth rate to be a serious prob
Social Biology

lem.® It would appear, then, that a majority
of Americans now reject arguments favoring
continued population increase and feel that
population growth is neither necessary nor
desirable for the United States.

However, while Americans are not favorably disposed to continued population expansion, they currently perceive it to be a
problem which is considerably less important than other domestic issues. For instance, the 1967 Population Council survey
found that crime was considered a more important problem than population growth by
eight out of ten respondents; racial discrimination, by seven out of ten; and poverty,
by six out of ten. Moreover, between 1965
and 1967 there was a decline in the proportion of Americans feeling that population
growth was a more serious problem than
these other domestic questions.

That Americans perceive the expansion
of their population to be appreciably less
important than other problems suggests
that population increase will not be immediately dealt with. However, the control
of domestic population growth should be an
important public issue by the end of the
1970’s at the latest, and very possibly by the
last half of the decade. This prediction is
based on two related assumptions. The first
is that, with the products of the postwar
baby boom now entering their main childbearing years, there will soon be a resurgence
in the rate of population increase which will
generate substantially greater concern with
population growth than currently exists.’

® Both surveys found that the proportions of
males and females considering population growth a
serious problem were roughly equal (see Kantner,
1968). This suggests that had men been included in
the sample of the current study the distribution of
responses to the five statements of the Population

Attitude Scale may not have been markedly different.

%A recent issue of the Monthly Vital Statistics
Report (Vol. 18, No. 4, June 30, 1969) estimates that,
in the twelve months ending with April, 1969, the
number of births was one per cent higher than in the

The second is that the present concern over
population expansion is primarily located at
the level of the individual rather than at the
public level; another five to ten years will be
necessary for the considerable and increasing
concern among individuals to be transformed into a major public issue. That issue
will be how, not whether, to control population size, and since continued population
growth stems from the desire of couples for
more than two children, the focus of the discussion will be on how to motivate couples
to want fewer children.

From the point of view of theory, three
findings of the present study are of appreciable interest. (In reviewing these findings, it must be kept in mind that the population studied is that of adult women living
in a relatively small city, that the completion rate for the survey was 73 per cent, with
fully one-fourth of those eligible not responding, and that several of the findings
are based on relatively small numbers of
cases.) The first may be stated as follows.

A positive and monotonic (i.e., unidirectional) relationship tended to exist between
educational level and the extent to which
continued population growth was considered
undesirable and unnecessary among women
in all age groups and both religious faiths.
However, when examined among women
similar in both religion and frequency of
church attendance, the monotonic relationship existed only among (1) Catholics attending church weekly and (2) Protestants
attending church once or twice a month.
Among Protestant women attending church
weekly, high school graduates were the most
likely to view further population growth as
undesirable and unnecessary.

preceding twelve months (3,511,000 vs. 3,482,000),
and that the crude birth rate was the same in both
twelve-month periods. Thus, it appears that the
decline in both number and rate of births has halted
and that the long-expected rise in the rate of natural
increase is immediately ahead.

Population Growth

33

A monotonic relationship of possibly
causal nature between education and attitudes toward population growth thus appears with greatest salience among groups
one and two above, and among these types
of women, a generally rising number of years
of schooling can be expected to increase the
prevalence of the attitude that continued
population growth is undesirable and unnecessary. However, it should be noted that
between 1958 and 1968 the proportion of
Catholics going to church every week declined on an average of one percentage point
per year (Gallup, 1968). To the extent this
decline continues—and there are good
reasons to expect it to continue—it will
probably take Catholic women out of the
weekly church attendance category far more
rapidly than a rising educational level can
generate more negative attitudes toward
population growth among weekly attenders.
Hence, among Catholic women as a whole, a
rising educational attainment does not appear likely to be an important factor in
bringing about a greater prevalence of negative attitudes toward population expansion.

If the attitudinal difference by educational level for those Protestant women attending church weekly is generalizable to all
Protestant women in the nation who attend
church every week, then as the level of education rises above high school among such
women there will be a decline in the degree
to which they view continued population
growth as undesirable and unnecessary.
However, while a post-high-schoo! education will lower the prevalence of negative
attitudes toward population expansion
among Protestant women attending church
weekly, a post~high-school educational attainment among Protestant women attending church once or twice a month appears to
foster an increased prevalence of such attitudes. In 1968, approximately two out of
five Protestants attended church weekly,
but the proportion fell an average of a half

percentage point per year in the preceding
ten years (Gallup, 1968); if this decline persists, it will take some Protestant women out
of the weekly attendance category and increase the number attending church once or
twice 2 month. Thus, the overall net effect
of a rising frequency of post—high-school attainment on the prevalence of negative attitudes toward population growth among
Protestants is hard to predict. However, it
seems likely to be small.

A second finding of theoretical interest is
that it was possible to eliminate significant
differences between educational levels in
attitudes toward population growth when a
control was instituted for income. When income was controlled by itself, education exhibited a significant relationship to attitudes
in only two of the six income brackets; and
when income was controlled along with religion and frequency of church attendance,
all significant differences between educational levels were eliminated. This indicates
either that in correlating with attitudes
toward population increase, education does
not operate independently of income as a
concomitant variable or that income is an
intervening variable between education and
attitudes. The latter possibility, however,
seems precluded by the failure of analysis of
variance tests to uncover a statistically significant association between income and
attitudes in any of the four educational
levels. If income was an intervening variable, a control for education would not have
eliminated all association between income
and attitudes unless education is the sole
cause of income level, which is obviously not
the case. It therefore appears that, in correlating with attitudes, variations in education operate alongside associated concomitant variations in income.

The third finding of theoretical interest is
that among women with a high school education or less who attended church either
weekly or no more than once every couple of

months, as well as among women with a high
school education or less and $10,000-+- income, the extent to which continued population growth was considered undesirable and
unnecessary was higher for Protestants than
for Catholics. The finding suggests that,
among women not having gone beyond high
school who attend church either weekly or
very infrequently, religious affiliation is a
causal factor in attitudes toward population
growth. In addition, the finding of a
Protestant-Catholic difference among women with relatively low education and high
income indicates that a causal relationship
also occurs in conjunction with a form of
status inconsistency. For reasons not at all
clear, status inconsistency involving greater
economic than educationa] attainment appears to provide a basis for the different
norms and values of the two religions to
operate causally on women’s attitudes
toward continued population growth.

PREDICTED TRENDS

However, regardless of the conditions
under which education and religion operate
as causes of attitudes toward population
growth, neither of these variables can account for the substantial and widespread
public determination to control population
size predicted for the United States during
the 1970’s. Educational attainment in the
society at large cannot change sufficiently in
the next five to ten years to serve as an adequate explanation, and since the determination to halt population growth should be
widespread in both religions (though not
necessarily to the same extent), it will have
to result from that which is common to
them. What, then, are the factors which will
bring about population control in the United
States? The writer believes there are four
major, and interacting, factors which are
rapidly generating sentiment for control of
population size.

First, in a technologically-advanced so

ciety with a culture such as exists in the
United States, population growth appears to
generate public needs faster than the rise in
population numbers, and possibly at a
faster rate than the income available to pay
the cost of meeting them. In a recent examination of state government expenditures in
California—where about 85% of the state’s
budget falls in categories in which the level
of spending is an obvious function of population size—the writer found that expenditures increased almost twice as fast as population between 1953 and 1967 (with inflation
taken into account) and that, in the same
period, there was a 34% increase in the proportion of per capita income required for
state expenditures per person. In actual dollars, per capita state government expenditures increased from $100.74 (0.044% of per
capita income) in 1953 to $216.79 (0.059%
of per capita income) in 1967. Since education is responsible for roughly 40% of the
state’s budget and is by far the single largest
item in the budget, it should be noted that
most of the increase in California’s population during this period resulted from immigrants, many of whom were adults and had
completed their education. In short, zero
population growth may be a simple financial
necessity in the United States if the country
is to fulfill its basic values (goals).

A second factor which the writer believes
will play a major role in bringing about the
control of domestic population growth is
that “success,” and thus those behavior
patterns promoting success, is a strong value
in American society. In the United States,
success seems to be typically defined in
terms of the degree to which the individual
maintains what may best be described as a
“comfortable” style of life. Continued population growth threatens that life style and,
therefore, the relatively strong value of
success. As this is increasingly recognized,
the result should be appreciable public support for controlling population size.

Population Growth 35

A third factor is that life and health are
important values in American society. There
is accumulating evidence that population
growth, and its associated rising level of environmental pollution, is negatively affecting the level of health of the American people,!° and the public seems to be approaching the point where it will be forced to
choose one of two values—that of life and
health or that of complete freedom to reproduce.

The fourth factor is the rural value inherent in American life. The national opinion
poll sponsored by the National Wildlife Federation (The Gallup Organization, 1969)
found that approximately half of the sample
selected a rural area, the mountains, or the
seashore as the most pleasant place to live,
with only 6% choosing a “large city.”” This
distribution suggests a strong rural value in
American society, a value seriously threatened by continued population growth, which
is diminishing the availability of open space
and destroying the natural beauty of the
environment. In support of this hypothesis,
an examination was made of the relationship between responses to the question on
ideal place to live and responses to the poll’s
question on the necessity of population limitation; it was found that 44% of those
selecting a rural area, the mountains, or the
seashore (or a combination of these), but
only 36% of those selecting a large city, felt
it would be necessary at some time to limit

10 For instance, population density, which affects the probability of contracting contagious
diseases, is presumably playing a role in increasing
the death rate from influenza in the United States:
“The cumulative death rate for 1968 (962 per 100,000 population) was well above that for 1967 (936

er 100,000 population).... From 1967 to 1968
the death rate for] Influenza had a greater percentage increase (352.9) than any other cause”
(Monthly Vital Statistics Report, Vol. 18, No. 1,
April 1, 1969, p. 3, 5). Moreover, “for the first 3
months of 1969 the death rate for Influenza was 55.3
percent higher than the rate observed for the same

period of 1968” (Monthly Vital Statistics Report, Vol.
18, No. 4, June 30, 1969, p. 3).

population size in order to preserve current
standards of living.”

By way of conclusion, the writer suggests
that the United States will move during the
1970’s to halt the growth of its population
and that it will do so because of the financial
burdens imposed by such growth and be
