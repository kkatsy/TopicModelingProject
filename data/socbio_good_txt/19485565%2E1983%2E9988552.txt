ABSTRACT: A comparison of the age-specific marital fertility experience of three successive cohorts in Taiwan indicates that the later cohorts have experienced progressively higher rates of
natural fertility at each age from 15-19 to 35—39. Their fecundability is correspondingly higher
and post-partum sterility, shorter. These changes in natural fertility levels occurred almost simultaneously with recorded changes in health and nutrition levels. These findings support the
hypothesis that during the process of modernization and the fertility transition, the level of natural fertility increases, potentially as a result of improvements in health and nutrition, and
changes in lactation practices. It is the net effect of increases in natural fertility on the one hand
and deliberate fertility regulation on the other, that determines the course of fertility over time,
especially at early stages of modernization and the fertility transition.

Although there is no doubt that ultimately social and economic modernization is accompanied by declining fertility, this relationship is more ambiguous
in the early stages of modernization and
the fertility transition. In fact, a positive
relationship between modernization
and fertility has often been observed,
both historically (Petersen, 1960; Borowski, 1970) and currently among less
developed societies (Henin, 1968; Kolata, 1975; Romaniuk, 1968, 1974, 1978;
Srinivasan et al., 1979).

It may be argued that in terms of
changes in general living conditions, nutrition, and health standards, modernization affects fecundity, fecundability,
and fetal mortality, and thereby fertility
(see, for instance, Easterlin, 1975,
1978). It has been observed that in the
early stages of the fertility transition,
fertility actually increases (Petersen,
1960; Nag, 1975; Caldwell, 1976;
Borowski, 1970; Barclay, 1954; May,
1978; Kocher, 1977), presumably due to

388

increases in natural fertility in the absence of deliberate control (Henry,
1961).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This paper presents data on Taiwan
at three points during the fertility transition to support the hypothesis of rising
natural fertility in the early stages of
modernization and the fertility transition. Three successive cross-sections of
cohorts aged 35-39, in 1960, 1965, and
1975, namely, the birth cohorts of 1921—
25, 1926-30, and 1934-38, respectively,
are compared. The data refer to continuously married women who at ages 35—
39 are nearing the close of their reproductive careers.

The data are taken from the 1965 and
1973 KAP surveys, which consist of currently married women aged 20-44 and
20-39 years old, respectively. The cohort aged 35-39 in 1960 was obtained

through the retrospective histories of
women aged 40-44 in 1965 for 1960
when they were aged 35-39. In all, the
analysis is performed on 499 women
born during the years 1921-25, 794 born
in 1926~30, and 1,553 born in 1934-38.

In Taiwan, fertility began to fall in
the late 1950’s; consequently, the 1921—
25 birth cohort may be said to represent
an early stage of the fertility transition.
Secondly, it was only in 1964 that the
island-wide family planning program
was initiated so that the 1926-30 cohort
represents Taiwan at a stage when
methods of regulation were more readily available and knowledge and approval more diffused. Finally, during
the reproductive career of the 1934-38
cohort, Taiwan was well into the fertility
transition, although it cannot be said
that the transition was completed.

It may be hypothesized that in Taiwan the 1921-25 birth cohort had experienced much of its fertility at a period
when overall levels of modernization
were low, so that general living conditions, nutrition, and health standards as
well as lactation practices and sexual taboo tended to depress the level of potential natural fertility. Each successive cohort is hypothesized to have gone
through its peak reproductive years under conditions which were more favorable to high levels of natural fertility.
This implies that they have progressively higher levels of fecundity and fecundability and therefore progressively
higher estimates of natural fertility. The
following section reviews the changes in
health, nutrition, and lactation conditions between the 1940’s and 1973 to justify the hypothesis of increasing natural
fertility. Thereafter, empirical evidence, based on the fertility experience
of these three cohorts, 1s presented.

FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR INCREASING
NATURAL FERTILITY

Natural fertility is influenced by biological, behavioral, and environmental
factors, the most prominent of which are
health conditions, diet and nutrition,
length of lactation, and intercourse taboos.

Health factors and the incidence of
disease affect fecundability and sterility
as well as fetal wastage. Diseases associated with subfecundity are venereal diseases (Romaniuk, 1968, 1978; Cantrelle, 1978), malaria (United Nations,
1954), plague, tuberculosis, and probably other febrile diseases. The availability of medical facilities and prenatal care
is likely to reduce both the level of fetal
wastage and the incidence of complications in childbirth.

Taiwan has clearly experienced improvements in health conditions as seen
by the increase in e¢ from 46 in 1940 to
68.4 by 1970, and the fall in the infant
mortality rate from 110 in 1950 (Barclay, 1954) to 25 in 1975 (Population
Reference Bureau, 1978). On the one
hand, the number of doctors per thousand population and the proportion of
births taking place in hospitals have increased. On the other hand, the incidence of diseases largely associated with
sterility and subfecundity has been reduced (Taiwan Demographic Yearbook, 1977). It was during the decade of
the 1950’s that significant changes in
public health and medical facilities, sanitation, and diet occurred. Medical and
health facilities were expanded, and maternal and child health centers were
opened. Compulsory insurance of
workers and free medical care for the
poor was initiated. Malaria stations and
X-ray units were established in local

390

areas. Immunization became widespread; malaria was eradicated, and
general preventive medicine practiced.
Simultaneously, attention was paid to
sanitation, housing conditions, sewage
disposal, and water supply. It was as late
as 1955 that drainage projects, control
of food and drugs, and regulation of
milk production and supply took place.
Cumulatively, these changes in health,
medical facilities, and sanitation are expected to have a positive effect on natural fertility.

Secondly, improved nutrition has
been shown to affect natural fertility
positively, by raising the level of fecundability (Frisch, 1975; Kolata, 1975;
May, 1978; McCabe, 1975). In Taiwan,
Mirzaee (1979) concludes that although
in the colonial period, improvements in
nutrition occurred, food refrigeration
facilities were limited. It was in the decade of the 1950’s that increase in annual
food production rose to 5 per cent, food
sanitation improved, and average protein consumption increased steadily
from 1946 to 1970.

Thirdly, changes from universal and
prolonged lactation to infrequent or
short periods of lactation reduce the
Jength of post-partum sterility, and raise
the level of natural fertility by reestablishing ovulation earlier (Romaniuk,
1974, 1978; Knodel, 1969, 1977, 1978).
A cross-sectional analysis of lactation
patterns in Taiwan (Jain et al., 1970)
shows a moderate, negative relationship
between length of lactation and level of
education and urbanization. Whereas
women with no formal education lactated on the average for 11.8 moths,
those with a senior-high-school education lactated for 6.5 months. Similarly,
whereas rural women lactated on average for 11.3 months, urban women did
so for 8.8 months. Though these results

Jejeebhoy

 

Social Biology

are based on cross-sectional data, it
seems justifiable, in view of the secular
trend in level of education and urbanization, to infer similar changes in lactational practices over time in Taiwan.

Finally, the breakdown of traditional
intercourse taboos tends to increase the
frequency of intercourse and thereby fecundability and the level of natural fertility. The most prevalent intercourse taboo pertains to the post-partum periods
(Nag, 1962; Caldwell and Caldwell,
1977; Karkal, 1971; Romaniuk, 1978),
and to special religious occasions, which
vary from culture to culture (for instance, see Chandrasekaran, 1952). Evidence regarding the breakdown of postpartum abstinence, has been recorded
for Africa (Caldwell and Caldwell,
1977). Similarly, Nag (1977) hypotheses
that in India, modernization has involved a looser adherence to intercourse
taboos. Unfortunately, there is little evidence regarding either the existence or
the breakdown of intercourse taboos in
Taiwan.

RESULTS

EVIDENCE OF AN INCREASE IN NATURAL
FERTILITY

Changes in health and nutrition conditions, and possibly lactation practices
between the 1940’s and the 1970's suggest a corresponding increase in the
level of natural fertility over time in Taiwan. When period data are considered,
there is some evidence of an increase in
fertility in Taiwan in the pre-transitional
stages. Barclay (1954) observes that
during the early period of the mortality
transition, 1895-1940, a simultaneous
increase in fertility occurred. The gross
reproduction rate increased from 2.93 in
1905 to 3.30 in 1940, that is, from a total

Vol. 30, No. 4

fertility rate of 6.0 to one of 6.8. Thereafter, however, the period data provide
no evidence of increasing fertility.
These data show a steady decline in both
the crude birth rate and the total fertility
rate, from the 1950’s onward, as shown
in Table 1. Simultaneously, there has
been.a secular increase in the extent of
deliberate fertility regulation, as shown
by both survey responses regarding use
of regulation, as well as an independent
measure, the m(a) index of fertility regulation derived from the pattern of the
age-specific marital fertility schedule
(see Coale and Trussell, 1974). It is clear

391

that fertility rates in this period can no
longer be said to represent natural fertility. This paper analyzes changes in natural fertility by considering the fertility
experiences of three cohorts, for whom
natural fertility is either known orcan be
estimated.

The fertility experience of three cohorts, born in 1921-25, 1926-30, and
1934-38, at progressively later points in
the fertility transition, provides microlevel data on the level and components
of natural fertility during their reproductive careers. Tables 2 and 3 and Figure 1 present retrospective age-specific

marital fertility rates for each cohort. In
addition, the (a) index of fertility regulation (Coale and Trussell, 1974) is
provided in Table 1 in order to assess the
extent of deliberate fertility regulation.!
Also, the standard natural schedule of
age-specific marital fertility comprising
some ten known natural age-specific
marital fertility schedules (Coale and
Trussell, 1974) is presented for comparative purposes (Table 3). Finally, in Table 3 the schedule of natural age-specific
marital fertility schedule is estimated for
each cohort. The index of fertility regulation is based on the age structure of
marital fertility schedules relative to the
age structure of natural fertility. The assumption is that the pattern of marital
fertility will be essentially parallel to the
standard natural fertility schedule if deliberate fertility regulation is not prac

ticed or will deviate from natural fertility in a manner that increases with age
according to a typicai pattern. The value
of m(a) is consequently independent of
the level of fertility and is purely a function of the age structure of fertility.

The m(a) index of fertility regulation
reveals that for all three cohorts, agespecific marital fertility up to ages 25-29
has been essentially natural (m(a) =
0.00). For ages above 30, age-specific
marital fertility becomes progressively
more modified by the practice of deliberate fertility regulation. Consequently,
at ages 30-34 and 35-39, natural agespecific marital fertility will be estimated.

Table 3 presents age-specific marital
fertility rates for each cohort. It is clear
that natural fertility at ages 15-19, 2024, and 25-29 has increased considerably over the three cohorts. For instance,
at ages 20-24, the 1926-30 cohort had
experienced 6 per cent more fertility
than the 1921-25 cohort, whereas the
1934-38 cohort had experienced 14 per
cent and 20 per cent more fertility than
the 1926-30 and 1921-25 cohorts, respectively. The increase in natural fertility at ages 25—29 is somewhat milder.

¢Standard natural fertility schedule (Coale and Trussell, 1974).

The 1926-30 cohort experienced 5 per
cent more fertility than the 1921-25 co
enced 10.5 and 16 per cent more fertility
than the 1926-30 and 1921-25 cohorts,
respectively.

This increase in natural fertility occurred primarily during the 1950’s,
which coincides with a period of improvements in health, nutrition, and living conditions in Taiwan. In fact, the
rates experienced by the 1934-38 cohort
at ages 20-29 (1958-63) closely approximate the rates recorded for the standard
natural fertility schedule, comprising
the average of some ten natural fertility
populations (Coale and Trussell, 1974).
On the other hand, the fertility rates for
the 1926-30 and especially the 1921-25
cohorts fall considerably short of those

of the standard natural fertility schedule.

Ignoring fertility at ages 15—19, which
is sensitive to the age distribution of
marriages in the age group and affects
only a small proportion of women in
each cohort, we find that total marital
fertility by age 30 provides evidence
concerning the pace of child-bearing.
On average, the number of births to a
woman exposed during the whole period, increased from 3.71 for the 1921-25
cohort to 3.91 for the 1926-30 cohort
and 4,39 for the 1934-38 cohort, implying a 5 per cent increase in fertility between the 1921-25 and 1926-30 cohorts,
and a 12 per cent increase between the
1926-30 and 1934-38 cohorts. During

the 1921-25 cohort (1945-50) and the

fertility by age thirty increased by almost one-fifth (18 per cent).

At the older ages, 30-34 and 35-39,
there is some evidence of fertility regulation in the 1926-30 and especially
among the 1934-38 cohort, as indicated
by the sharp decline in the fertility rate

these ages, the natural fertility rate may
be approximated by applying the formula used to obtain 7(a), under the assumption that (a) =0.10,?

careers of the three cohorts, while on
the other hand, and in the opposite direction, the level of natural fertility has
also increased. The observed total marital fertility rate by ages 35-39 fell from
6.443 for the 1921-25 cohort, to 6.154
for the 1926-30 cohort and 6.024 for the
1934-38 cohort, representing a decline
in fertility of 4.5 per cent and 6.5 per
cent between the experiences of the
1921-25 and 1926-30 cohorts and the
1921-25 and 1934-38 cohorts.

This decline clearly reflects the opposing trends of increasing fertility regulation and natural fertility. The practice
of fertility regulation has averted 0.8 per
cent fertility among the 1921-25 cohort,
9,2 per cent for the 1926-30 cohort and
21.3 per cent for the 1934—38 cohort. On
the other hand, the natural level of total
marital fertility has increased by 4.6 and
18.1 per cent between the careers of the
1921-25 and 1926-30, and 1921-25 and
1934-38 cohorts, respectively. In other
words, the 6.5 per cent decline in the observed total fertility rate between the
1921-25 and 1934-38 cohorts, reflects a
20.7 per cent increase in averted fertility
on the one hand, and an 18.1 percent increase in natural fertility on the other.

COMPONENTS OF NATURAL FERTILITY

Natural fertility is immediately determined by the level of fecundability,
post-partum amenorrhea, primary and
secondary sterility, and duration of exposure to the risk of pregnancy. In this
analysis fecundability may be measured
by the length of the first birth interval. It
is clear that in this case, the estimate of
fecundability will not be contaminated
by factors such as post-partum amenorrhea and anovulatory cycles which affect
inter-live birth intervals. The second
birth interval will include both basic fecundability as well as post-partum

amenorrhea. Primary and secondary
sterility and subfecundability is measured by a self-reported variable.

Once again, these components of
natural fertility confirm a steady increase in the level of natural fertility between the 1921~25 and 1934-38 cohorts
respectively. The first birth interval
shows a decline of about 4 months between the experience of the 1921-25 and
1934-38 cohorts, implying that on the
average, it took a woman born in the
1921-25 cohort four months longer to
conceive her first child. The second birth
interval is affected by physiological factors such as post-partum amenorrhea
and anovulatory cycles as well as sociocultural factors such as length of practice
of lactation, extent of post-partum intercourse taboos, and so on. The second
birth interval declines by 2.7 months or
8.4 per cent between the experience of
the 1921-25 and the 1926-30 cohorts,
and 4.7 months or 16.1 percent between
those of the 1926-30 and the 1934-38 cohorts, and 7.4 months or 23 per cent for
the entire period.

Finally, the incidence of primary and
secondary sterility and subfecundity
may be said to have fallen slightly over
the period. The results suggest, however, that it is changes in average fecundability, and especially the length of
post-partum sterility, that are responsible for the increase in the level of natural
fertility over the course of the reproductive histories of the three cohorts.

These factors, such as declining fecundability and post-partum amenorrhea have arisen as a result of improved
health, nutrition, and diet, as well as
changes in lactation practices, which are
largely associated with the process of
modernization. Underlying the observed increases in natural fertility,
then, there have been secular changes in

‘Excludes primary, secondary sterility, and subfecundity. Fecundity status as reported by respondents is defined as: (a) primary sterility: never had a child; (b) secondary sterility: have not had a child for a long time; (c) subfecundity: husband or wife is
unhealthy, has had trouble bearing children. The 1921-25 cohort’s estimate of fecundity is likely to be overestimated, since their

for the 1934—38 cohort. Finally, the rates
of infant and child mortality fell considerably, from 11.2 per cent among the
1921-25 cohort to 8.9 per cent for the
1926-30 cohort and 5.4 per cent 1934-38
cohort. It may be hypothesized then that
the observed increase in natural fertility
levels may be attributed to the process
of modernization.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The age-specific marital fertility experience of three cohorts who underwent their reproductive histories at progressively later stages of modernization
and the fertility transition are compared. It is clear that the later cohorts
have experienced progressively higher
rates of natural fertility at each age from
15-19 to 35-39. Their fecundability is
correspondingly higher and post-partum sterility shorter. These changes in
natural] fertility levels occurred almost
simultaneously with recorded changes
in health, and nutrition levels.

The case of Taiwan, from the experience of these three cohorts, supports the
hypothesis that during the process of
modernization and the fertility transition, the level of natural fertility potentially increases as a result of improvements in health and nutrition and
changes in lactation practices. In the
course of the fertility transition then,
both the level of natural fertility and the
extent of deliberate fertility regulation
increase. It is the net effect of these two
factors on observed fertility that deter

mines the course of fertility over time,
especially at early stages of modernization and the fertility transition. It is only
when the increase in natural fertility Jevels off and the practice of fertility regulation expands that the secular decline in
fertility may be observed.
