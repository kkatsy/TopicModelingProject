Obituary

Harry L. Shapiro
1902-1990

Harry Lionel Shapiro, curator emeritus of physical anthropology in the Department of Anthropology at The
American Museum of Natural History
passed away January 7, 1990. Dr. Shapiro was born in Boston, Mass., on
March 19, 1902. He graduated magna
cum laude with a B.A. degree from Harvard University in 1923, and received a
Master’s degree from Harvard in 1925
and a Ph.D. degree in 1926.

Dr. Shapiro’s major research was in
physical anthropology and human biology, including the areas of race mixture
and population, and he made important
contributions to the public understanding of anthropological theories through
his activities in exhibition, teaching, and
publication. He conceived and supervised the preparation of the Hall of the
Biology of Man, which opened at the
Museum in 1961.

His association with the Museum began in 1926 when he was appointed assistant curator in the Department of Anthropology. He became associate
curator in 1931 and was chairman and
curator of physical anthropology from
1942 until his retirement in 1970.

Before joining the Museum, Dr. Shapiro was a Thaw Fellow and tutor in anthropology. He began teaching at CoJumbia University in 1938 and was
professor of anthropology from 1943 to
1974. As a consultant to the American
Graves Registration Command, he
went to Europe in 1946 to set up a
method for identifying unknown dead
that served as a basis for subsequent

identification work in all theaters of war.

Dr. Shapiro’s field work was extensive. In 1923, when he was unable to get
to Pitcairn Island, he undertook a pioneer genetic study of the descendants of
the Bounty mutineers (1789) living on
Norfolk Island. He reached Pitcairn successfully in 1934 and remained through
1935, completing his study of the race
mixture that resulted from marriages
between Bounty sailors and Tahitian
women. These studies are described in
his book The Heritage of the Bounty.

In 1927 he did field work in archeology and physical anthropology in the
Dominican Republic, and in 1928 in
New Mexico. He participated in several
population studies dealing with the
physical anthropology, race mixtures,
and genetics of such areas as Polynesia
(1929-30, in cooperation with the
Bishop Museum of Hawaii); Point
Hope, Alaska (1941); and Puerto Rico
(1947-48, a socio-biological study). Dr.
Shapiro’s research during the 1940’s
helped lay the foundations for forensic
anthropology, and he frequently assisted the New York City medical examiner’s office in identifying homicide victims. In 1956 he conducted an American
Museum expedition to study the archeology of the Marquesas.

In 1965 Dr. Shapiro made the first of
three trips to India at the invitation of
the Indian Statistical Institute to establish research programs and studies in human biology with the cooperation of
members of its staff. One study concerned the biological responses of man

to conditions of extreme crowding in
Calcutta.

Dr. Shapiro designed and supervised
The American Museum’s Centennial
Exhibition, ‘““Can Man Survive?’’, the
first multi-media environmental exhibit
in a museum. It opened at the beginning
of the Centennial Year in 1969 for a twoyear run.

Dr. Shapiro’s books include The Heritage of the Bounty (1936), Migration
and Environment (1939), Race Mixture
(published by UNESCO in 1953), Aspects of Culture (1957) and The Jewish
People, a Biological History (1961). He
edited Man, Culture and Society (1956)
and wrote a large number of scientific
papers and articles for professional and
popular publications.

In 1964 Dr. Shapiro received the
Theodore Roosevelt Distinguished
Service Medal for his contributions to
science. He was a fellow of the National
Academy of Sciences and a member of
its council from 1957 to 1960. He was a
member of the American Anthropological Association (president, 1948), the
American Association of Physical Anthropologists (secretary, 1935-39, and
vice-president, 1941-42), the American
Eugenics Society (president, 1955-62),
the American Ethnological Society
(president, 1942-43), the New York
Academy of Sciences (chairman of the
anthropology section, 1939), and the editorial advisory board of the National

Academy of Sciences. He served as
chairman of the division of anthropology and psychology of the National Research Council and was an associate of
the Bishop Museum in Honolulu for
many years. In 1964 he was elected honorary fellow by Die Anthropologische
Gesellshaft in Vienna.

Dr. Shapiro was the Brown and Haley Lecturer, College of Puget Sound, in
1956; the tenth A. Walter Suiter Lecturer, New York Academy of Medicine,
in 1958; the eleventh Herman L. Reiss
Memorial Lecturer, New York Institute
of Clinical Oral Pathology, in 1962, and
first Burke Lecturer, Thomas Burke
Memorial Washington State Museum,
University of Washington, in 1964.

After his retirement in 1970, Dr. Shapiro maintained offices at the American
Museum and took an active role in its
department of anthropology.

He continued his celebrated studies
on Peking Man, and in 1974 authored a
book entitled Peking Man. In September of 1980, he was invited to China asa
guest of the Institute of Human Paleontology, where he went to research new
clues on the origins and validity of Peking Man.

In 1977, the New York Academy of
Science gave Dr. Shapiro an award for
his distinguished service to science.

Dr. Shapiro’s wife, Janice Sandler
Shapiro, died in 1962. His children are
Thomas, Harriet and James.
