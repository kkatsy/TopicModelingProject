Development of an Animal Model

of Alcohol Dependence

ABSTRACT: Students of the actions of ethyl alcohol have often divided these actions conceptually into avidity, sensitivity, tolerance, and dependence. Here at the University of Colorado Alcohol Research Center, we are engaged in development of an anima] model for further study of
the mechanisms which underlie dependence. To this end we are undertaking genetic selection
for differential severity of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome in the laboratory mouse. Results
are presented for 12 generations of replicate line, bidirectional, within-family artificial selection. The results to date are discussed with reference to natural selection, whose effects are adding unforeseen complications to the selection response.

Among the principal constructs used
in explanations of alcohol-related behaviors, we might list avidity, seeking
and consuming alcoholic beverages;
sensitivity, the behavioral changes (often decrements) which occur after consumption; tolerance, a decrease in effect
after repeated doses; and dependence,
the occurrence of rather distinctive signs
and symptoms of distress during withdrawal from alcohol after longcontinued use. In this paper the focus
will be on dependence.

For over a hundred years, theorist
and practitioner alike have debated the
extent to which alcohol-related behaviors have a genetic basis (see Crowe, this
volume). Their answers—perhaps not
surprisingly—seem to range from 0 to
100 per cent. Recent human studies
(e.g., Goodwin et al., 1973; Schuckit
and Rayses, 1979) implicate a significant
genetic component for aspects of
alcohol-related behavior and metabo
lism. These studies have been the subject of a useful review by Goodwin
(1980).

Despite wide acceptance of the view
that at least some genetic influence 1s operative, precise mechanisms remain unknown. Ethics, of course, constrain certain types of human experimentation
which could illuminate mechanisms. In
such cases, use of animal models has
proved fruitful. As examples, avidity for
alcohol has been studied using a tap water vs. dilute alcohol solution preference
paradigm with laboratory mice (Anderson and McClearn, 1981) and with laboratory rats (Mardonnes et al., 1953);
sensitivity to alcohol has been studied in
mice (McClearn and Kakihana, 1973;
1981) and in rats (Riley et al., 1976); tolerance has been studied in rats (Eriksson and Rusi, 1981); and dependence
has been studied in mice (Goldstein,
1973). Belknap (1980) has reviewed the
use of animal models in alcohol re

search, and two recent monographs
(Eriksson et al., 1980; McClearn et al.,
1981) have stressed the utility of employing animal models for study of
alcohol-related behaviors and mechanisms.

Shortly after the formation of the
University of Colorado Alcohol Research Center in 1978, with its emphasis
on genetic mechanisms, a group of coinvestigators, including DeFries, Erwin,
McClearn, Petersen, and myself, began
to discuss the development of a new animal model for the study of alcohol dependence. These discussions led to the
design of several pilot experiments to
determine an effective means of inducing mice to consume sufficient ethanol
to develop dependence. We tried several different regimens, including inhalation of ethanol vapor. Though promising, the technique had two major
drawbacks: (1) Control of dosage was
difficult, and there was a great deal of
variation in effective dose among the individual mice within an inhalation
chamber; and (2) respiratory illnesses
were common among the treated mice.
It should be noted that Crabbe et al.
(1983) have successfully employed the
inhalation technique for dosing mice by
incorporating pyrazole injections into
their treatment regimen to control effective dosage (Goldstein, 1973). We had,
of course, known about this technique,
but wished to avoid the use of a second
drug, if possible. Finally, we settled on
dosing via inclusion of ethanol in a liquid
diet furnished as the sole source of nutrients.

One useful result of the pilot experiments concerning dosing techniques was
our finding that dependence could be induced in mice after just 9 days on the

alcohol-laced diet, as measured by con

ventional pharmacological criteria such
as spontaneous seizures and loss of body
temperature. We were thus reassured
that this dosing method was feasible, albeit moderately difficult.

For actual development of an animal
model of dependence, we rather naturally turned to the technique of genetic
selection—led, no doubt by the proven
utility of the long-sleep (LS) and shortsleep (SS) mice which had been selected
for sensitivity to ethanol by McClearn
and Kakihana (1973; 1981). Collins
(1981) has reviewed many of the studies
that have used these selected lines. To
begin genetic selection, however, we
needed to choose an index of selection.
Examining our pilot data once again, we
decided that the pharmacological construct of dependence could perhaps be
measured more fully by using several
measures in addition to seizure susceptibility and temperature loss. Principal
component analyses of data sets which
included these measures, along with
others, indicated that a first principal
component (1PC) score derived from
seven physiological and behavioral measures was likely to be a more complete
measure of dependence. The derivation
of this 1PC index is discussed more fully
by McClearn et al. (1982).

Having determined to follow the
rather radical notion of selecting on a
composite index derived by a multivariate procedure, we began genetic selection in 1979, with the expectation that
the lines produced would prove useful
for eventual anatomical, pharmacological, and physiological studies concerning the mechanism(s) underlying dependence. Progress reports on this study are
available in Allen et al. (1983) and
Wilson et al. (1984).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

As the detailed methodology being
employed is available within the two references cited immediately above, only
an abbreviated version is included here.

SUBJECTS

As a foundation population to begin
selection, 111 male and 89 female hetervogenieous stock (HS) mice (McClearn et
cal., 1970) were used. All mice in this
Study are bred, reared, maintained, and
tested under specific-pathogen-free conitions.

ETHANOL TREATMENTS

APPARATUS AND TESTING

Testing begins 6 hours after withdrawal of the ethanol diet. Though a
larger number of scores are recorded
during testing, only the specific seven

scores which are used to define the 1PC
selection index are described below.
The 1PC index is derived separately for
males and females, as the component
weightings are somewhat different. The
seven scores making up the 1PC index
are: (1) Ethanol consumption is calculated across the 9 days of treatment and
converted to grams of ethanol consumed per kilogram of body weight. (2)
Using a modification of the procedures
described by Goldstein and Pal (1971),
seizure severity is assessed using a 4point scale. (3) HW entry latency, (4)
spontaneous HW seizures, and (5) HW
crossings are recorded during a 3minute test in a hole-in-wall (HW) apparatus (McClearn et al., 1970). (6) Body
temperature is recorded. (7) Total VS
crossings are recorded during a 3minute test in a vertical screen (VS) apparatus (McClearn et al., 1982).

SELECTIVE BREEDING

Using the 1PC derived from the
seven measures described above (see
McClearn et al., 1982, for weighting
coefficients), we began artificial selection. First, 10 families (litters) from the
base population were randomly chosen.
A male and a female were then randomly chosen from each family and
were mated randomly inter se to begin
Control Line Number 1 (C,). Next, the
male and the female in each family
which had the largest 1PC scores were
selected and mated randomly inter se to
begin Severe Ethanol Withdrawal Line
Number 1 (SEW)). From each of these
same families, the male and the female
with the lowest 1PC scores were selected
and mated randomly inter se to begin
Mild Ethanol Withdrawal Line Number
1 (MEW)). Froma second set of 10 families from the base population, C2,

SEW, and MEW) were similarly begun. From selected Generation 1 onwards, each line has been maintained as
a closed breeding population, with continuing selection pressure imposed in
the appropriate direction (or not imposed, in the case of the control lines).
After selection of the prospective mates
within each line, matings are set up randomly for each generation. Results from
12 generations of selection in this continuing program are reported herein.

tion for females and for males, respectively. In Figure 3, the responses are the
unweighted means of the two sexes, and
the responses shown in Figure 4 are further collapsed across replicate lines.
Several features of these response
plots are of interest. From the plots for
the individual sexes, it can be seen that
the initial directional responses to selection were somewhat erratic, and were
sometimes opposite to that expected.
Comparison of our results to those from
other selection studies shows this feature to be fairly common, though perhaps more marked than usual in our experiment. After Generation 5, the
response appears to be in the appropriate direction. Tests for significance (in

dependent t-tests) of line divergence
(SEW, VS. MEW, and SEW, VS. MEW, )
have confirmed separation from Generation 7 onwards.

The odd response of the C, line has
puzzled us for sometime. We have confirmed that the response has not been
the result of (inadvertent) selection
pressure from choice of random samples for mating which happened to show
unusually low expression of the ethanol
withdrawal syndrome. The most likely
explanation for the oddity of response is
genetic drift, with the non-random gene
arrays within the 10 families constituting
the line in one of the early generations
having arisen as a result of genetic losses
from the premature death or infertility

of animals within this line, as explained
below. Whether or not this explanation
is correct, the problem does seem to
have resolved itself, as the response of
this line in the last two or three generations has been reasonably intermediate.

Comparison of the responses by sex
(Fig. 1 vs. Fig. 2) shows that males are
much more affected by the treatment
regimen, with four of the six lines appearing above the abscissa and the other
two barely below. Responses of the females, in contrast, are more symmetrical; if anything, they have an overall
downward trend. Even our early pilot
studies had identified a lesser response
in females to alcohol withdrawal. These
results highlight their “resistance” even

more, as the component weightings
used to define the separate (by sex)
1PCs are quite similar. At this point we
can only speculate that the greater resistance in females may be due to their
higher estrogen/androgen ratio during
development and maturity.

The generation-to-generation irregularities in the response plots were earlier
thought to be due to unknown deviations in the laboratory environment. We
had even attempted to clarify the selection response by plotting all responses as
deviations from the overall generation
mean (Allen et al., 1983), on the assumption that environmental deviations
should affect all six lines about equally.

 

Though this plotting option may well be
useful on occasion, we now believe that
these particular results are better expressed without prior subtraction of the
generation mean. The reasons for this
are discussed below.

In Generation 10, average realized
(within-family) heritabilities for the response to selection (Wilson et al., 1984)
ranged from 0 (MEW,;) to 0.23 (SEW)).
If these estimates are converted to the
form obtained from a mass selection design, they are in the vicinity of 0.2, on
the average. Estimation of realized heritabilities here is complicated by the
asymmetry of response by the two

Fic. 4.—Response to selection, sexes and replicate lines combined.

While studying details of the response to selection, we analyzed the responses in Generation 12 separately for
each measure (see Fig. 5). On the
whole, the individual measures constituting the 1PC selection index are also
responding well to artificial selection, as
shown by the normalized (z-score) plots
in Figure 5.

Before normalization, it was evident
that alcohol consumption is increasing
substantially in nearly all lines. Plots
showing these increases are shown separately by sex in Figures 6 and 7. From
these figures, three broad phases for
consumption level can be discerned: an
early (Generation 1-4) steeply rising

gradient in consumption level; a plateau
(Generation 5-7); and another steep
rise (Generation 8-11). Females are
now consuming an average of 50 per
cent more alcohol than was the case for
females in the base population, while
males are consuming about 65 per cent
more. Overall, the sex difference in favor of greater consumption by females
remains.

These large increases in consumption
may be partially the result of the artificial selection program, since consumption is one of the measures constituting
the 1PC selection index, and the index is
weighted in favor of higher consumption
leading to a higher 1PC score. However,

its component loading is rather less than
those for most of the other six measures;
yet, it shows by far the largest change
across generations. It appears that we
have here a noteworthy example of the
power of natural selection. Proceed as
we will with artificial selection for a dependence character, the process must of
course remain embedded within natural
selection processes: Only survivors can
pass on their (selected) genes to the next
generation, and only fertile survivors do
so.

From this perspective, some of the irregularities in the selection response be
gin to make sense. During treatment
with the alcohol-laced liquid diet, most
animals lose weight. Some die before
testing begins; others die during or just
after testing, despite our best efforts to
aid their survival. Of the survivors which
are selected to be parents for the next
generation, many prove to be infertile.
In the case of either individual death or
infertility of one of the mates, the line
suffers genetic losses. These genetic
losses in each generation are shown in
Table 1.

It now seems that an animal’s survival
(and fertility) depend on a delicate bal

ance between two conflicting demands:
The animal must (1) eat enough to ensure survival, and (2) not over-indulge,
or death may ensue during withdrawal.
For the artificial selection project, we
had assumed that average consumption
would remain approximately constant,
as it is the resultant of positive hunger
motivation and the mildly aversive dietalcohol mixture offered. It would appear that natural selection, working on

 

 

individual differences in this resultant,
has operated to increase dramatically
the average alcohol dosage. Animals
from later generations (especially females) are now able to survive the very
large alcohol doses they voluntarily consume. The shifts in the death and infertility rates across generations may be
seen to be associated with different
phases of the increase in average consumption, as the pendulum swings now

toward more consumption (and more
deaths during withdrawal) and then toward a plateau in consumption (and
fewer deaths). We are seeing (as has often been seen) that we can, gradually,
change gene frequencies. Mother Nature is proving once again that she remains the mistress of the process.

It would be desirable to have more
strongly divergent lines to use in the

search for mechanisms underlying dependence. Results from the last few selection generations show little divergence; this may be a temporary selection
plateau, or it may indicate that we have
reached the operational limits with this
particular index and methodology. To
decide which may be the case, selection
is continuing.
