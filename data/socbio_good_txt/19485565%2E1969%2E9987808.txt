A Demographic Dilemma: The Parsis of Karachi

Elizabeth B. Gustafson

Department of Sociology
University of California
Davis, California

“Parsi” is the secular name of the Zoroastrians, worshippers of Ahura Mazda aad
followers of the pre-Christian prophet Zoroaster. For many centuries leaders in the encient Persian Empire, Zoroastrians today
constitute a small religious minority in Iran
and the South Asian subcontinent. They «re
believed to number about 150,000, Bombay
is now the main center of Parsi Zoroastrian
culture, having a Parsi population of abcut
70,000, The next largest Parsi community,
numbering about 4,500, is in Karachi, Pa <istan. This paper reports the major findir gs
of a demographic survey of the Parsi conmunity in Karachi conducted in the spring
of 1965.

The Parsi community is a closely-krit,
homogeneous group, socially self-sufficient
and isolated from the surrounding Muslim
majority. It is a closed endogamous “‘conmunity” which in many respects may be
considered a caste. If a Parsi man does m1rry out of his religious group, his wife remains a non-Parsi but his children are considered Parsis. If a Parsi woman marries
out of her religious group, the children «are
not Parsis.

 

This small community is of sociological
interest because it has a history of social
self-sufficiency now threatened by the impact of modern ideas and social innovations.
Ths rule of endogamy, which forbids any
Parsi to marry outside the community, and
the corollary rule forbidding conversion into
the community are leading the group into a
demographic impasse. The birth rate is low,
because of a high marriage age for females
and perhaps also because of endogamy and
inbreeding. Although the death rate is also
low, the rate of natural increase of the population is negligible. There is some emigration
from the community largely because the
young people are being exposed to Western
ideas and customs which conflict with the
traditional restrictions, It is an open question, therefore, whether the community will
be able to withstand these pressures from
without and within.

CONDUCT OF THE SURVEY

The survey of the Parsi population of
Karachi covered 4,198 persons, about 92%
of the Parsi population according to an
extrapolation of figures given in the decen

nial census of Pakistan of 1961.1 The Parsis
live in clearly-defined neighborhoods in
Karachi. Members who knew the community intimately helped with the survey, and
the well-organized community charity organizations were able to lead us to the poorest Parsis as well as to the rich. Thus, there
is no reason to believe that any serious bias
is caused by the 8% not included in the
survey.

of the Parsi community before the survey

Response to the questionnaire was good.
Almost all Parsis read and speak English;
certainly at least one person in every household can do so. Many Parsis volunteered
much time on all stages of the study, and
almost all members of the community responded willingly.

was begun. Field work was conducted in
stages between April 15 and July 15, 1965.
Information was collected on a de jure basis
by means of a household questionnaire designed with a separate section for each
individual, including usual household members temporarily absent and temporary
visitors. The form was filled out by the family, then collected, checked, and, if necessary, returned to the family by the enumerator.

1The Karachi District Census Report for 1961
records a Parsi population of 5,018 in 1951 and 4,685
in 1961. At this rate of decrease, the population in
1965 would have been about 4,564. The present
survey covered 4,198 persons, which is 92% of

the population according to extrapolated census
figures.

pyramid (Fig. 1) reveals at a glance that
the Parsi population in Karachi is very unusual for an Asian population. A diagram of
this sort for most Asian populations forms a
broad-based pyramid with a very high percentage in the age group below fifteen. The
pyramid in Figure 1 closely approximates

2 The quinquennial age groups were chosen because they are the ones regularly used in the Pakistan Census and other demographic studies in Pakistan. No attempt has been made to compensate
for heaping and other deficiencies in the single-year
age distribution which was calculated. The risk of
such errors was felt to be relatively small for two
reasons. First, the Parsi population is virtually
100% literate. Second, age was elicited in terms of
date of birth. There may have been some heaping,
especially among women, for the year of birth 1900,
and possibly for the years 1910, 1920, and 1930.
But there is no clear sign of misreport of birth date
at these or other years.

the standard model of a “constrictive pyramid” and indicates an “old” population. In
fact, the median age of Parsis is 37 years,
while for Muslims in Karachi it is 22 years
(Hashmi, 1965, p. 31)*. The fact that the
lower two bars of the pyramid are relatively
short indicates a low birth rate and a proportion of children insufficient to maintain
the population in the long run.

The average number of births and dez.ths
in the community over the ten years from
1955 to 1965 can be calculated, although the

tion over this time span and comparing it to
annual births and deaths produces an annual
crude birth rate of 13.2 per thousand and a
crude death rate of 9.5 per thousand. This
means that the population is growing
through natural increase at a rate of about
0.37% per year. However, analysis of Pakistan census figures of 1951 and 1961 (Central Statistical Office, 1961) indicates a
decrease in the population of about 0.65%
per year. The difference between the census
figures and ours is probably explained by

for the high priority it puts on education,
financial gain, and general adoption of Western customs. It is responsible to a large extent for the steady decrease in the Parsi
population.

It is common knowledge within the Parsi
community and among demographers concerned with populations in the subcontinent
that the birth, death, and growth rates of
the Parsi population are strikingly low.
C. Chandra Sekar’s important paper of
1948 indicated a similar situation among
Bombay Parsis in 1948. Although most of
Chandra Sekar’s discussion deals with data
covering the years 1901 to 1941, he also
made some predictions about future development in the demographic picture for
the Parsi community in Bombay. It is interesting to compare his predictions for the
much larger community in Bombay with the
results of our Karachi survey.

Chandra Sekar predicted that the Bombay community would increase slightly in
size between 1941 and 1951 and begin to
decrease within the next decade. He estimated that between 1951 and 1971 the
population would decrease by about 4%.
This decrease of 0.4% per year seems to be
slightly pessimistic, since the present study,
dealing with approximately the same years,
found a minimal growth of about 0.4% per
year. However, we should note that these
data are not dependable enough to quibble
over, and in any case their close approximation is apparently fortuitous since Chandra
Sekar’s estimates of birth and death rates
for the 1960’s do not correspond to our
results. Using census figures from 1941,
Chandra Sekar figured a birth rate of 19.4
per thousand per year for the Parsi community in Bombay and a death rate of 15.1,
and he predicted that both would remain
stationary. In Karachi in 1965, both were
considerably lower, the birth rate being 13.2
per thousand and the death rate 9.5 per
thousand, although they still bear approximately the same relationship to each other.

Social Biology

It may be that Chandra Sekar’s dire forecasts about the diminution of the Parsi
community will yet prove correct, but the
decrease may start later and proceed more
rapidly than he expected. The population
pyramids which Chandra Sekar constructed
to illustrate his estimates of the Parsi population at ten year intervals from 1951 to
2001 are all quite rectangular, suggesting a
static demographic situation. On the other
hand, an extrapolation from the pyramid in
Figure 1 of this paper would show a topheavy population dropping rapidly in numbers by the year 2001.

The masculinity ratios of the different age
groups of the Parsi population are also
shown in Table 1. It is interesting to note
that this pyramid does not reveal the high
ratio of young males evident in the Muslim
population of Karachi, where many men immigrate for jobs, leaving their wives and
children in the villages. Indeed, the ratio of
Parsi males in the 20-24 and 25~34 cohorts
is unusually low, which may indicate that
the out-migration previously mentioned has
been male-selective in these ages. There is
also the troubling fact that the masculinity
ratios for age groups 0-4 and 5-9 and 10-14
are well above what one might intuitively
expect in such a relatively closed population.

Taken at face value the high masculinity ratio indicates either a young female selective out-migration, which from our other
knowledge of the community is highly unlikely, or it indicates higher female than
male mortality at the lower ages. The latter
explanation for abnormally high masculinity
ratios is often employed for India and Pakistan and justified by the argument that, with
the higher regard accorded males, female
children are neglected (Rakunudin, 1967).
No such negating of the importance of females seems a part of Parsi tradition, and
since overall mortality rates are very low,
excess female mortality seems an unlikely
explanation in this case. Age-heaping or female-selective underenumeration might ex

plain the discrepancy, but neither se2ms
highly probable in a literate, cooperative
group such as the Parsi community.

The dependency ratio of the Parsi pcpulation is much lower than the dependency
ratio of Karachi Muslims, Thanks to higher
life expectancy in their community, there
are almost five times as many people over 65
per hundred workers (persons aged 15 to 64)
among the Parsis as among Muslims (1.6.8
compared to 3.5). But there are more tian
twice as many children aged 0-14 per worker
in the Muslim population than there are

lives with the boy’s family for a few months
or a year, but before children are born they
usually set up housekeeping on their own.
Table 2 shows that 80% of young families
now live separately from other relatives.
Some 70% of the middle-aged population
live in nuclear-family units, but only 50%
of the older population. Most striking is the
difference between generations in joint
families. Of the two younger groups, only
5% live in joint families, while almost 25%
of families with household heads over the
age of 55 live in joint families.

There is no doubt that this shift to

Overall, in the Parsi community there are
about 46 dependents for every hundred

Karachi in 1961 the proportion is 75 per

nuclear families can often have a disruptive
effect on the cohesiveness of the community.
Nevertheless, the familial ties still seem
close. In many cases related families live in
separate flats in the same building, fathers
and sons or sons-in-law may still work together, and there is constant inter-visitation
and cooperation of many kinds.

Among other interesting characteristics
of the Parsi family is the fact that in almost
a fourth of the families, a woman is considered the head of the household. In most
cases it is an older woman whose husband
has died. (The median age for male household heads is 46 years; for women it is 55.)

hold. The fact that women are given this role
is another sign of the status and respect
which Parsis accord their women.

RESIDENCE AND MOBILITY

Compared with the Muslim population,
90% of which have come to Karachi since
Partition in 1947, the Parsis are an old
established community in Karachi. About
28% of Parsi families indicated that their
forebears have lived in Karachi for at least a
century. Some 19% replied ‘‘unknown’’ to

modern commercial Karachi emerged in the
ensuing decades. No wave of Parsi immigration is associated with the Partition of 1947.
In fact, Parsi immigration dropped off
radically just when Muslim immigration
was rising to its peak, and only 5% of Parsi
families settled in the period 1950 to 1965.
There are no figures on Parsi emigration
from Karachi to India at the time of Partition, but the general impression among
Karachi Parsis is that emigration also was
negligible. On the whole, the Parsis had political and economic reasons to stay where

old families, since when the family had been
in Karachi for generations, the respondent
was less likely to know the exact data of
original settlement. The fact that many
Parsi families have lived in Karachi for
many generations has perhaps helped them
to become relatively well-established and
prosperous.

A wave of Parsi immigration to Karachi
from India seems to have occurred during
the first half of this century. Some 29% of
the families indicated the period 1900 to
1929 as their settlement date in Karachi.
Probably an important motive was the establishment of business enterprises (branches of Parsi firms in Bombay, in particular) in
Karachi. The British began developing
Karachi as a major military depot and port

they were during the Muslim-Hindu population movements.

The data collected on mobility reveal
that members of the Parsi community are
less mobile than might be expected (see
Table 3). In the query about change of residence within a year and within five years,
the mobility revealed is extremely low. In
fact, many Parsis have lived in the same
house for twenty-five years or more. Even
upward mobility has not typically been
followed by parallel shifts in housing, as is
common is Western society. The more recent moves of households heads under the
age of 35 probably reflect the establishment
of new homes after marriage. Once settled,
these young families may also be expected to
live in the same place for many years.

EDUCATION

Education is evidently important to the
Parsis. It is clear from Table 4 that almost
all school-age children in the Parsi conmunity attend schools, a fact which sharply
distinguishes them from the total school-age
population of Karachi. It appears that bcys
tend to start slightly earlier, at age six,
while many girls do not begin school until
they are seven.

than girls. There were only 2 out of 175
women over the age of twenty-four still in
school, while there were 16 out of 152 men.

Analysis of the number of school years
completed by adults over twenty-five years
of age also indicated that both men and
women have made educational gains over
the last three generations. The biggest
change is in women’s education. Out of thir

It used to be that a large number of cildren could be expected to drop out of school
after they had completed their “Matric,”
corresponding to the tenth year of school.
This resulted in a break in the percentage

ty-five is eleven years; for all women, ten
years.

The same trend toward more education,
especially for women, is revealed in data on
attainment of degrees. While virtually no
woman over 55 had more than ten years of
formal schooling, nearly a fifth of the women
in the 25-34 cohort have degrees higher than
the Bachelor of Arts. In recent years more

5 Some informants observed that this development caused some discomfort in the community
because these young girls were now equipped to
get well-paying jobs, and this disrupted their traditional position in the marriage market. Our data
on marriage show that the median age at first
marriage was considerably older for women in the
35-54 age group than for older women.

Social Biology

men have also been working for higher degrees. In higher education, the Parsi community is ahead of the Muslim population.

LABOR FORCE CHARACTERISTICS

The labor force characteristics of the
Parsi community are quite unlike those of
most communities of the subcontinent.
Tables 5 and 6 show the breakdown of employment and occupations.

It is notable that very few Parsis under
the age of twenty are in the labor force. In
most subcontinental communities the tendency is to put children to work at least by
the time they are in their teens. Even the
male participation rate in the 20-24 cohort
is relatively low, reflecting the fact that men
stay in school longer.

Our definition of ‘‘working” does not include “housewife.” One-fourth of Parsi
women between 15 and 64 years of age work
in jobs away from home (full or part-time),
as compared with some 5% of Muslim women in Karachi. Almost half the Parsi women
between 20 and 24 years of age (usually unmarried) have jobs. The percentage drops
off gradually until in the 45-54 cohort only
one-fourth of the women work and in later
years less than a tenth. Unfortunately,
since no earlier statistics exist, it is impossible to ascertain from these figures whether
more women are working now than used to,
although the notion in the community is
that this is the case.

Other persons “not working’ are students, young girls awaiting marriage, a few
persons disabled or looking for jobs, and
retired men.

Most Parsis (76%) work for private employers. Our figures unfortunately do not
reveal what proportion of employers are

One of the traditional occupational
specialities of the Parsis has long been clerical work, and our survey shows that -he
most popular occupations are still in this
field (see Table 6). Administrative jobs,
mainly ownership and management jobs,
are common among the older men and reflect the business spirit for which the ccmmunity is known. It is also interesting to

group nonetheless. It includes a number of

the ways in which it does so.

MARRIAGE AND FERTILITY

Table 7 summarizes the marriage patterns in the Parsi community. Detailed
analysis revealed that age 26 is the youngest
cohort at which there are more women
married than unmarried; for men, this point

is not reached until age 32. The youngest
widow is 28 years old; the youngest widower, 52 years old. There are 268 widows in the
community, 45 of whom are under 55 years
of age; and 55 widowers, of whom only two
are under 55 years old. The relative longevity of women partially explains the difference. Moreover, following the Hindu
pattern, most widowed Parsi women would
not marry again, while widowed men might
well do so.

females 20 and over were ever married,
compared to 95.2% of Muslim females 20

The median age at first marriage among
the Karachi Parsis has fluctuated widely in
the last forty years for both men and women. Fifteen females aged 55 and over at the
time of the survey reported being married
when less than fifteen years of age, while
only two from age group 35-54 and one from
the age groups under 35 were less than fif

* No one under the age of twenty had ever been married.

Divorce and separation, strongly disapproved of in the community, are likely to
have been under-reported. Our figures show
eight divorced women and three divorced
men. The discrepancy may result from the
fact that the divorced husbands are more
likely to have moved away or to have married again.

The percentage of married Parsis is unusually low. Among females 20 years and
over, 56.6% were currently married compared to 73.5% for all Karachi Muslims
(Hashmi, 1965, p. 44). About 74.4% of Parsi

over was 22 years; for females aged 35-54, it
was 25 years, while for females under age
35 it was 22 years.

The rise in median age at first marriage
for the middle group may be explained by
the new popularity of education for women
which occurred in the thirties and forties.
The figure of 22 years as the median age for

be even higher than 73.5%, thus sharpening the
contrast.

first marriage in the youngest group is mi3leading, because some of the single women
in this cohort will eventually marry, thus
raising the median age for the whole grou).
The same explanation applies to the apparent drop in age at marriage for the youngest
cohort of men. The data show 26 years us

years, which is the median age for the oldest
cohort of men.

Table 8 compares some Parsi fertility
ratios (broken down by marital status of
women) with similar ratios for the Muslim
population of Karachi. The radical difference between the groups may be caused Ly
differences in marriage patterns. A larger
number of Parsi women never marry, as we
have seen. However, the important point is
that, because they are so highly motivated
to become well-educated and prosperous,
and because it is much harder for them to
find husbands, Parsi women marry at alater
age than their Muslim contemporaries.
Even 22 years is an advanced age for marriage, demographically speaking, compared
with 18.2 years, which is the average age at
marriage for Muslim women in Karacii
(Korson, 1965, 589). Because female f2cundity drops so rapidly, even a few years

difference in age at first marriage has a
substantial effect on fertility (Coale and
Tye, 1961).

There is a further unproved possibility
that inbreeding among the Parsis may lead
to lower fertility. Although some Parsi
couples may practice family planning for
spacing or for limitation of family size, there
is every indication that the Parsis as a group
do not have such a low fertility rate by
choice, although at one time some of them
wanted to control reproduction for financial
and eugenic purposes (Chandra Sekar,
1948, p. 89). It was not possible to collect
information on symptoms of inbreeding or
on family-planning practices. Respondents
were sensitive on the subject of their low
birth rate and also about the privately
acknowledged existence of diabetes, con

poor health and proved hostile to direct
questions on such matters in a pre-test of
the questionnaire. The director of the Karachi Family Planning Clinics corroborated
our impression that nowadays Parsi women
are interested only in learning how to have
more children.

The completed fertility figures for Parsi
women further indicate the low fertility of
the community. Table 9 shows the mean
number of children ever born to ever-married women, of different age groups. We

assume on the whole that the fertile years
are over for women over 44 years of age and
that these figures represent completed fertility. There is some slight indication of a
downward trend in completed fertility when
age groups 65 and over, 55-64, and 45-54
are compared, but it is dubious because of
the problem of recall in such a retrospective
question. In any case, Parsi completed fertility, even taking the highest of these
figures, is only about 60% of the comparable
figure for Muslims in Karachi.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The survey of the Parsi population of
Karachi succeeded in verifying one accepted
belief about the demographic character of
the community. It is a small, endogamous
population, dwindling in size because the
relatively low death rate is matched by a
birth rate astonishingly low for an Asian
population. These patterns lead to a very
low dependency ratio, which may contribute to the prosperity of the community, but
coupled with considerable out-migration
from the community they mean that this
small community is shrinking in overall size.

As far as family and occupation are concerned, the Parsis exhibit behavior familiar
in Asia. The nuclear family is becoming
more popular as the members of the community become more Westernized. Parsis
remain loyal to their traditional occupational fields: auditing and accounting, banking,
clerical work, and trade and transportation.

In the field of education the Parsis have
led the way for their compatriots. Virtually
every Parsi over five years of age has had
some formal education, and the trend is
toward increasingly higher education for
men and women alike.

The mobility patterns of the Parsis are
unique in Karachi. While most Muslims are
new arrivals in the city and apparently
move fairly often, 75% of Parsi families
have been in Karachi since before Partition

Social Biology

and many have stayed in the same home for
generations.

The great anomaly presented by the Parsi
community is the conflict between its precarious demographic position and its rules of
endogamy and nonconversion. The death
rate among Parsis is very low and bears
witness to the advanced state of education,
medical care, and community charity. At
the same time, the percentage of Parsis married is low, age at marriage is relatively
high, and the birth rate is very low. The
out-migration rate is high because higher
education and experience with Western
customs attract many young people away
from the community where occupational
and marital opportunities are limited and
personal freedom sometimes conflicts with
community traditions.

One could argue that the very realization
of these facts by the community might set
in motion forces sufficient to check the
downward trend, for even a modest rise in
the proportion of females marrying or a
slight fall in the average age at marriage for
females might be enough to restore demographic vitality to the community. A small
decrease in emigration, which occurs primarily among men in the 20 to 30 year age
group, might lead to the needed improvement in the marriage market. In 1948, C.
Chandra Sekar believed it possible for the
community to reverse its demographic fate,
and he wrote in a reforming spirit of the
birth-rate problem and the steps Parsis
should take to overcome it. A popular version of the same story written by a prominent Parsi in the same year was widely
publicized within the community in Bombay and Karachi (Desai, 1948). A paper by
Maneck B. Pithawalla and Beheram Rustomji, published in 1945, carried the same
message. But the community did not respond to these warnings, and in the meantime the number of persons leaving the
community has increased,

The dilemma is a difficult one. An improvement in the demographic situation—-a
drop in the average age of marriage for won)en and an increase in the total number of
women marrying—would probably requi:e
both men and women to sacrifice some recent educational and occupational gains.
Young people would have to resist the tem’>tation to leave the community. But it is not
reasonable to expect that this will happen
unless the more restrictive community customs, particularly the endogamy and no1conversion rules, are relaxed to some exteit
to enhance the attractiveness of communi:y
life and broaden the marital possibilities
open to females. This, in turn, might fundamentally change the character of community relations. Thus, the Karachi Parsi cora
