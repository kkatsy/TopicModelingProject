Indications of Recent Demographic

Change among Blacks*

Reynolds Farley

Population Studies Center

Ann Arbor, Michigan

During the last thirty years, there have
been major changes in race relations within
the United States. On one hand, the institutions of our society have taken several
steps which may have improved the status
of blacks. The Fair Employment Practices
Act of the 1940’s was followed by numerous judicial decisions in the 1950’s which
banned discrimination and then, in the
1960’s, programs designed to mitigate poverty and increase school readiness flourished. In recent years, private employers
have advertised their willingness to hire
and promote blacks while numerous universities have intensively recruited black
students. One might anticipate that these
programs would go far toward incorporating blacks into our society and improving
their socioeconomic status. Nevertheless,
during this period, racial riots flared, many
violent deaths occurred, and persistent
patterns of racial segregation and racial
differences in poverty are obvious to anyone who examines the nation’s larger cities.

The decennial census enumerations provide excellent detailed descriptions of the

changing characteristics of our population.
From them, we can learn much about the
location and characteristics of both blacks
and whites. We can readily test hypotheses
about whether racial differences in socioeconomic status have diminished or grown
wider, and we may be able to gain some
insights into factors which account for
changes in the status of blacks or whites,

This paper begins with a description of
the growth rate of the black and white
populations. Next, there is an account of
the changing residential distribution of
blacks within this country. Regional and
city-suburban growth rates for blacks are
compared to similar rates for whites. The
remainder of the paper examines the hypothesis that the socioeconomic status of
blacks, relative to whites, has improved in
recent decades. Demographic data concerning education, occupation, and income
are examined.

At present, the federal statistical agencies tabulate data for the white, the black,
and the other-races population. Wherever
possible, figures for the white and black
populations have been analyzed. In the
past, however, many tabulations were
available only for whites and nonwhites
and these have been used when necessary.

The vast majority of nonwhites in the
United States are Negroes; for example
in 1970, 89% of all nonwhites were
blacks (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1971a,
Table 2).

THE CHANGING GROWTH RATE
OF THE BLACK POPULATION

When the Constitution was ratified,
Negroes comprised about one-fifth of the
total population. For a few decades after
the Revolution, the white and black populations grew at about the same rate, that
is, 2 to 3% each year (Taeuber and Taeuber, 1967). An annual rate of growth of
2.5% doubles a population in less than
thirty years. Since the actual growth rates
exceeded this, both the white and black
populations were doubling every generation
prior to the Civil War.

Following Emancipation, the growth
rate among blacks declined for many
decades sinking to a minimum during the
Depression decade when the growth rate
was under one per cent each year. Among
whites, growth rates after the Civil War
were lower than before, although immigration buoyed the white rate until the
mid-1920’s. In general, then, the white
population grew more rapidly than the
black for a period of about a century and,
as a result, blacks comprised a smaller
and smaller share of the total population.
By 1940 only 9.7% of the population was
black (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1961a,
Table 44).

The growth rates of both whites and
blacks have moved in a similar direction
since 1940. The growth rate rose gradually during World War JI, increased more
rapidly after the war, and remained at a
relatively high level throughout the 1950's.
Since the Jate 1950’s, the growth rates of
both groups declined. Percentage change
in population by race, for five-year periods
between 1940 and 1970 are shown in

Table 1 (U. S. Bureau of the Census,
1970a, Table 3).

The increase in the growth rate, which
occurred during and after World War II,
was greater among blacks than among
whites, and the decreases, during the
1960’s, were smaller among blacks. Consequently, the racial difference in growth
rates has grown larger. In 1969-70, for
instance, the black population grew at an
annual rate of 1.8%, while the white
population grew by 1% (U.S. Bureau of
the Census, 1970a, Table 3). As a result
of these higher growth rates, blacks now
comprise about 11.2% of the population
(U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1971a, Table
2).

FERTILITY TRENDS

A population’s natural increase represents the difference between its fertility
and mortality rates, and these rates must
be considered in describing population
growth. The major reason for more rapid
population growth after 1940 was a rise
in fertility; the decrease in the growth
rate during the 1960’s is accounted for
primarily by a drop in birth rates.

Women who were born around 1910
attained childbearing ages during the
Depression and, in an historical context,
these women had uniquely small families.
These black women averaged about two

- Oo

Vol. 18, No. 4

and one-half children, and the white
women averaged just over two. The longrun trend toward smaller families ended
in the 1940’s. After World War II, age
at marriage dropped sharply and couples
had many children rapidly after they
married. Family size has risen and the
women who were born during the Depression—women who began their childbearing during the late 1940’s and 1950's
—will bear many children. By the completion of their fertility, white women are
likely to average three children and black
women about four (U. S. Bureau of the
Census, 1961d, 1969a, 19705 and 19718).
This shift to higher fertility rates and
larger families produced higher rates of
population growth during the 1950’s,

During the 1960’s, fertility rates declined sharply. Many young women who
got off to rapid starts on their childbearing
during the 1950’s compensated by having
fewer children when they were at older
ages. Among both blacks and whites, fertility rates at age 35 and over are now
lower than ever before (U. S. National
Center for Health Statistics, 1969, Tables
1-8). Simultaneously, young women who
reached childbearing ages during the
1960’s married at a somewhat later age
and got off to a rather slow start on childbearing.

Although fertility rates have fallen for
a decade, we cannot be certain that small
families are now the rule or that our population will grow at a low rate. Since the
mid-1950’s, there have been survey studies
which interview American women and ask
their fertility expectations (Freedman,
Whelpton, and Campbell, 1959; Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson, 1966; Ryder and Westoff, 1967; Davidson, 1971).
Married couples consistently report that
they expect to have two to four children,
the average being just over three. The
fertility expectations reported in the most

Demographic Change among Blacks 343

recent survey, conducted in 1967, are quite
similar to those of the earliest year, 1955.
If these fertility expectations are accurate,
the fertility rates of both blacks and
whites will go up during the 1970’s as the
women who delayed having children during the 1960’s build their families.

Most of these studies indicate that Negro women expect to bear more children
than white women. However, this is not
true for all groups. Nonwhite women
who have a complete high school education or who grew up away from the rural
South make use of contraception and have
fertility patterns like those of similar white
women (Whelpton, Campbell and Patterson, 1966, Chap. 9). Nonwhite women who
lived in the rural South or who grew up in
the rural South had exceptionally high
fertility. Indeed, one group of investigators
argued that the chief reason why black
fertility rates exceeded those of whites was
the high fertility of rural black women.
They predicted that as blacks became
urbanized and educational attainment increased, there would be a convergence of
black and white fertility rates (Whelpton,
Campbell and Patterson, 1966, p.369).

MORTALITY TRENDS

The mortality rates which prevail in a
population may reflect much about that
population’s living conditions as well as
the society’s investments in health and
welfare. Mortality trends are best summarized by the expectation of life at birth.
This indicates the number of years a
person will live if the mortality rates, observed in the year of birth, remain unchanged. In 1940, nonwhites in the United
States had a life expectation of 53 years
which was eleven years shorter than the _
white life expectation of 64 years. After
1940, death rates among both races were
reduced because of improved standards of
living—that is, improved diets and housDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:32 08 December 2015

ing—and because of medical innovations.
The growing use of antibiotics, for example, mitigated deaths from infections
and contagious diseases.

Most of the reductions in mortality occurred between the late 1930’s and the
mid-1950’s, Since 1955 there have been no
more than modest improvements in the
death rates, primarily because a very high
proportion of deaths are associated with
the aging process. There will be no dramatic increase in life expectation in the
future unless some way is found to abate
the biological degeneration which occurs at
the oldest ages. The elimination of the remaining infectious diseases, even the elimination of cancer as a cause of death, will
do no more than increase the expectation
of life by a few years (U. S. National
Center for Health Statistics, 1968).

Reductions in mortality have been somewhat greater among nonwhites than among
whites and, as a result, the racial gap in
life expectation has narrowed. By 1968,
the most recent year for which data are
available, the nonwhite life expectation was
64 years, which is 7 years behind the
white figure. At present, as in the past,
death rates for both sexes and at most ages
are higher among nonwhites than among
whites. There is only a small racial difference in the accidental death rate but for
death due to cardiovascular-renal causes,
from malignant neoplasms, influenza, diabetes, cirrhosis, and tuberculosis, the rates
are higher among nonwhites than among
whites. The nonwhite infant mortality rate
remains much greater than that for whites,
although the racial gap with regard to
infant mortality has narrowed in the last
few years (U.S. Public Health Service,
1970, Table 5).

In the future there are likely to be some
modest reductions in the mortality rate
and these may be somewhat greater among
nonwhites than among whites. However,

the major determinant of the future growth
rate will be fertility, not mortality.

The census bureau’s population projections indicate that the black population
will continue to grow more rapidly than
the white in the future. Blacks will comprise a larger component of the total population, although the change in racial
composition is unlikely to be very great.
For instance, with rapid population growth,
by 1990 blacks will make up about 13 to
14% of the national population (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1968, Tables 1 and 6).

THE CHANGING LOCATION OF BLACKS
REGIONAL CHANGES

At the time of the Civil War approximately nine out of ten blacks lived within
the South and this did not change in the
decades which followed Emancipation.
Some blacks sought jobs in the cities of
the North or settled on the western plains
but their numbers were few, and the census
of 1900 discovered that 90% of all Negroes were in the South.

The major migration of blacks away
from the South began during World War I,
because northern industries required many
more workers at a time when the European
hostilities had cut off the immigration of
white foreigners. The declining economic
conditions in southern agriculture also impelled blacks to move north. This substantial out-migration of southern Negroes has
continued to the present. The rate of migration slowed in the Depression, then increased to a very high level during World
War II—the first period in which large
humbers of Negroes elected to move to the
western states, primarily California. After
the war, the migration process did not
stop; rather, large numbers of Negroes
moved away from the South and into the
cities of the North and West throughout
the 1950’s and 1960’s (Taeuber and
Taeuber, 1967, p. 108-116).

This population redistribution produced
shifts in the location of Negroes. The top
panel of Table 2 shows the regional distribution of blacks and whites at dates
from 1900 to 1970, while the lower panel
displays the regional growth rates for the
three most recent decennial spans. We observe that in recent decades the black population in the western and north central
states has been growing most rapidly and,
by 1970, just under one-half of the Negro
population resided outside the South. Nonetheless, the southern black population has
grown and is now larger than ever before.

Shifts in the regional distribution of
whites are somewhat different and less pronounced than among blacks. For whites,
the West has been the region experiencing
most rapid growth, although the southern
states have also been increasing at a high
rate. As a result, the proportion of whites
who live in the South or West has risen;
the proportion in the northeastern or north
central states has fallen.

URBANIZATION

The regional redistribution of blacks has
occurred simultaneously with the urbanization of blacks. Almost all the black out
Demographic Change among Blacks

345

migrants from the South relocated themselves in or near cities and, within the
South, there has been a shift away from
agriculture on the part of both whites and
blacks.

The census bureau’s definition of urban
residence has changed from time to time
which impedes an analysis of long-term
changes. However, we can assemble comparable data for the period 1940 to 1969
which are shown in Table 3. In 1960, the
census bureau defined 212 Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSA), each
of which consisted of one or more central
cities of at least 50,000 and the surrounding county area. This system permits us to
describe fluctuations in the composition of
central cities and their suburban rings,
that is, the portion of the SMSA outside
the central city. The nonmetropolitan area
consists of all people who do not live in
metropolitan areas—people who are on
farms and in smaller cities. The first panel
of Table 3 indicates the numbers of people
who lived in each type of area; the second
panel shows the distribution of whites and
blacks by place of residence; and the final
panel indicates the growth rates in the
recent period.

* Each percentage reflects the change from the previous decade, e.g., percentages given under 1950 reflect the change

from 1940, and so on.

In 1940, over one-half of the black population was located in nonmetropolitan
areas, but this changed during and after
World War II. The metropolitan population expanded rapidly while the nonmetropolitan population actually declined, so
that by 1970 70% lived within SMSA’s.
Among whites, there was also a rapid
growth of the metropolitan population and
relatively slow growth of the nonmetropolitan population.

Within metropolitan areas, there was a
great racial disparity in the growth rates.
The white population within central cities
reached a peak between 1950 and 1960 and

declined by at least two million during the
following decade. The suburban white population, however, grew very rapidly. Indeed, all the post-World War IT rise in the
metropolitan white population can be accounted for by increases in suburban population.

Among blacks, metropolitan growth has
occurred primarily because of rising populations within central cities. To be sure,
the growth rate of the suburban population
has been substantial, but suburban areas
contained relatively few blacks both in
1940 and 1970. The result has been a large
difference in the color composition of cen

Vol. 18, No. 4

tral cities and their suburban rings. Blacks
comprise almost 35% of the cities’ population, but only 5% in the suburban rings.

The census of 1970 discovered black
majorities in three major central cities—
Washington (71%), Newark (54%) and
Atlanta (51%). In three other large cities
blacks made up well over 40% of the
population—Baltimore (46%), New Orleans (45%) and Detroit (44%). The proportion black in the suburban rings
surrounding these central cities was much
smaller—8% in Washington, 10% in Newark, 6% in Atlanta and Baltimore, 13%
in New Orleans, and 4% in Detroit (U. S.
Bureau of the Census, 1971c).

RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION

Within metropolitan areas, the residences of Negroes tend to be segregated
from those of whites. In an exhaustive
study of the available data, the Taeubers
(1965) found that residential segregation
was prevalent both in cities of the North
and of the South, in large cities and in
smaller ones. They demonstrated that economic factors did not account for residential segregation; rather, well-to-do blacks
were segregated from whites of the same
economic level just as impoverished blacks
were segregated from impoverished whites.

We do not know whether the residential
segregation of the races increased or decreased during the 1960’s. One exploratory
study, analyzing data collected in a small
number of cities between 1964 and 1967,
discovered modest increases in residential
segregation. Summarizing their work, Farley and Taeuber (1968, p. 954) concluded:

Putting these results together with those
for 1940-60, there is strong evidence that the
pervasive pattern of residential segregation
has not been significantly breached. Whether
the temporal trend for a particular city has
been up, down or fluctuating, the magnitude
of the change has been small. Stability in

segregation patterns has been maintained
despite massive demographic transforma

tion, marked advances in Negro economic
welfare, urban renewal and other clearance
and resettlement programs, considerable undoubling of living quarters and diminished
room crowding, high vacancy rates in many
of the worst slums, and an array of federal,
state and local anti-discrimination laws and
regulations.

CHANGES IN EDUCATION
EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT

During the last thirty years, the educational attainment of the adult population
has increased dramatically. Among black
men, for example, the rise in median years
of school completed was from 5.4 years in
1940 to 9.9 years in 1970; among white
men the change was from 8.7 to 12.2 years,
Similar increases occurred in the educational attainment of women. This has occurred primarily because young people are
remaining in school much longer now than
in the past. For example, only 15% of the
black men who were teenagers during the
Depression completed high school; but by
the late 1960’s, over 60% of the black
teenagers were finishing secondary school
(U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1963@, Table
176; 19698, p. 49-51). Table 4 shows the
educational attainment distribution of nonwhite and white adults for dates between
1940 and 1970.

We observe a reduction in the proportion who have had only an elementary
education and a2 sharp rise in the proportion with a high school or college degree
among all groups. Within the white community, there has been only a small difference in the attainment of men and women.
However, black females have traditionally
received more education than black males.
This has gradually changed and by 1970
the attainment of black men approximated
that of black females.

The educational attainment of whites
exceeds that of blacks, and it is important
to ascertain whether this racial difference
has diminished or grown wider in recent

of blacks and whites. The one we chose is
delta or the Index of Dissimilarity (Duncan and Duncan, 1955). This index is
useful for comparing two groups which are
distributed among categories such as educational attainment levels. Suppose there
were no racial differences in the years of
school completed by blacks and whites.
Then if 10% of all whites completed a
specified number of school years, we would
expect 10% of all blacks to have a similar
number of school years. If this were the
case for every attainment level, delta
would equal zero implying no racial difference in educational attainment. If, on the
other hand, all blacks were concentrated at
certain educational levels and all whites at

 

other levels, delta would equal 100, indicating no overlap in the distribution of
whites and blacks by education. Thus, this
index ranges from 0 to +100. Low values
suggest racial similarity while large values
suggest just the opposite. Table 4 contains
deltas comparing the educational attainment of blacks and whites.

The figures in Table 4 indicate an increase in educational attainment and a
reduction in the racial difference throughout the period 1940 to 1970. The decade
1950 to 1960 witnessed a rather sharp
drop in the racial difference. The rise in
the proportion of blacks who completed
secondary school appears particularly sharp
during the 1960’s, but there was an equally
large jump in the percentage of whites who
completed high school. We conclude that

Vol. 18, No. 4

educational attainment increased and racial
differentiation decreased in the 1960’s, just
as it did in the two previous decades.
Nevertheless in 1970, as in 1940, the educational attainment of whites exceeded that
of blacks. We note that these figures refer
to years of schooling completed. They do
not measure, in a direct way, qualitative
dimensions of learning.

SCHOOL ENROLLMENT

Racial differences in educational attainment are smaller among the young than
among those who are older. We may be
able to assess recent changes and future
trends by analyzing school enrollment patterns. If racial differences in attainment
are soon to disappear, we would anticipate
similar enrollment rates among blacks and
whites who are now teenagers or of college
age. Table 5 presents enrollment rates for
the population age 14 to 29 by age, sex,
and color for the most recent census years,
1960 and 1970. Some caution is needed in
interpreting trends since the 1960 data
come from the decennial census while the
1970 data were obtained by the Current
Population Survey.

There has been a general increase in
school enrollment as well as some upgrading of enrollment. That is, among those
who are enrolled, the proportion in college
was typically greater in 1970 than in 1960.

When enrollment rates of blacks are
scrutinized, we observe sharp increases at
ages 16 to 21. By 1970 approximately onequarter of the black men and one-fifth of
the black women of college age attended
colleges or universities. This is approximately the proportion of the same age
groups of whites who were enrolled in
college in 1960.

Among whites, the increases in enrollment at ages 18 to 21 are at least as great
as among Negroes, while at ages 22 and
over, the increases were much sharper

Demographic Change among Blacks 349

among whites. These changes in enrollment
suggest that racial differences in enrollment
through the completion of high school are
gradually being reduced. It is likely that,
in the future, roughly equal proportions of
whites and blacks will graduate from secondary school. However, at college ages,
racial differences in enrollment seem to be
increasing because of the recent jump in
the enrollment of whites. These enrollment
data imply that there will continue to be
racial differences in educational attainment
and that the proportion with a college
education will continue to be much greater
among whites (for further discussion of
racial differences in educational attainment
see Price, 1969, Chapter 6.)

EMPLOYMENT AND OCCUPATION

LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION
AND UNEMPLOYMENT

Blacks and whites in the United States
differ both with regard to their participation in the labor force and the occupation
pursued by those who are employed. We
begin this section by describing changes in
the labor force status of adults and their
unemployment rate.

Table 6 shows the proportion of blacks
and whites, age 16 and over, who were in
the labor force at dates between 1940 and
1970. Since the end of World War II, the
proportion of adult men who are in the
labor force, that is, who are at work or
looking for work, has declined among both
whites and nonwhites. This has occurred,
in part, because of earlier retirements and
the trend toward greater educational
attainment. The decline in labor force participation, however, has been sharper
among nonwhites and labor force participation rates at all ages are considerably
lower among nonwhite men than among
white. Demographic data do not explain
why participation rates are relatively low
among nonwhite males, but several labor

force analysts hypothesize that some men
may have withdrawn from the labor force
because they could not secure suitable
work (Bancroft, 1958, p. 49-52; Bowen
and Finegan, 1969, p. 49-53). They would
argue that the low rate of labor force participation among Negro men, as well as the
high unemployment rate, reflect the severe
problems many black men face in securing
an income.

Among women, both nonwhite and
white, there has been a marked rise in
labor force participation. These rates apparently went up very sharply during
World War II, fell back a bit after the
war, and then resumed their climb in the
1950’s. In recent years, the increase in
labor force participation has been greater
among white women. Nevertheless, at every
date for which information is available, the
participation rate was higher among nonwhite women.

The unemployment rate is a highly sensi
tive indicator of current economic conditions. During the 1930’s unemployment
rates were very high, but in the following
decade, when there was complete mobilization for the war, they fell to all-time lows.
Since the end of World War II, the unemployment rate has fluctuated in response to
the economic situation. In the early 1950’s,
during the Korean conflict, this rate was at
a low level. Later in that decade and during
the early 1960’s, unemployment rates rose
to a rather high level. During the mid1960’s, as the federal government introduced many domestic programs and
increased involvement in the southeast
Asian war, unemployment rates declined,
reaching a minimum in 1969. Since early
1970, the unemployment rate has climbed,
and by early 1971 was at the same level as
in 1964.

There is scant evidence that nonwhites
have made much progress in terms of the
unemployment situation since the end of

World War II. If we look at the data for
males, we see that at every date since
1948, the nonwhite unemployment rate has
been one and one-half to two times as
large as that for whites. Among females,
the nonwhite unemployment rate has consistently been about one and one-half times
that of whites. In addition, a relatively
large proportion of black men are not in
the labor force.

OCCUPATIONS OF THE EMPLOYED

Racial changes in the occupations pursued by employed workers are more easily
described. Table 7 shows the occupational
distributions by race and sex for the period
1940 to 1970. The data for the initial
three dates come from decennial censuses
while those for 1970 were obtained in a
census bureau survey of 50,000 households. This table also indicates the 1960 to
1970 change in the number of nonwhites
and whites employed in particular occupations.

If the occupations of men are considered, we observe that the proportion of
both nonwhites and whites who worked at
professional and managerial jobs rose while
the proportion working on farms has plummeted. This trend toward upgrading of the
occupational distribution has resulted from
urbanization and the increasing need for
highly skilled workers, for professionals,
and for managers. We note sharp increases,
particularly during the 1960’s, in the number of nonwhite men employed at white
collar (professional, managerial, clerical,
or sales) jobs or as craftsmen. Indeed,
rates of increase for nonwhites in these
occupations have been much greater than
the corresponding rates for whites.

Changes among women are analogous to
those occurring among men. Employment
in white collar jobs has grown much more
rapidly than employment in manual jobs.
Over time, the number of women working

 

Social Biology

on farms has declined, although the April
1970 survey found more white women who
were employed as farm laborers than did
the census of 1960. The occupational distribution of nonwhite women has been upgraded more rapidly than that of whites,
because the proportion employed at white
collar jobs rose more rapidly among nonwhites.

Data in Table 7 imply that nonwhites
made occupational gains in the recent decades. Racial differentiation in occupational structure can be measured by
computing deltas to compare the distributions of employed whites and nonwhites.
Eleven occupational categories were used
in these calculations. Table 7 contains
these deltas computed for the years 1940
to 1970,

Among males, there was a reduction in
racial differentiation during the 1940's,
probably a consequence of the changes
associated with the tremendous increase in
the need for workers during World War II.
In the following decade, there was little
change in the value of delta; but during
the 1960’s there was a further reduction in
the racial difference as the occupational
distribution of blacks improved.

In 1940, three out of four employed nonwhite females labored on farms or as
domestic help. This declined rapidly and
there have been sharp rises, especially in
the last ten years, in the proportion of
nonwhite women who hold professional,
clerical, or service jobs. As a result, racial
differentiation has dropped and the occupational distributions of blacks and whites
have become more alike.

SUMMARY

Many of the changes in employment
and occupation indicate that nonwhites improved their status somewhat more rapidly
than whites. An increasingly large proportion of blacks are obtaining white collar

and craftsmen jobs and, as a consequence,
racial differences are smaller now than they
were in the past. Nevertheless, racial differences are by no means negligible. The
proportion of men who are participants in
the labor force remains lower among nonwhites and the unemployment rate for
blacks is almost twice that of whites.
Furthermore, despite the progress of this
period, the proportion of workers with
white collar jobs is nearly twice as great
among whites as among nonwhites.

INCOME TRENDS

The previous sections have analyzed
changes in several important demographic
dimensions. Next, we will describe some
trends in income. Unfortunately we cannot
establish a lengthy series on this topic. The
census of 1950 was the first to include a
detailed question on income, and census
bureau surveys began to collect income
statistics from samples of the population in
the post-World War II era. We are restricted to examination of trends in the last
twenty-five years.

This has been a prosperous span and
family incomes have risen rapidly as can be

Farley

Social Biology

seen by examining Table 8 which displays
median income figures for white and nonwhite families. These are given in terms of
1969 dollars. The actual incomes reported
for these years were adjusted for inflation
and consequently increases in income, as
indicated by this table, represent real improvements in purchasing power. If we consider the entire span from 1947 to 1969,
we see that the real income of white
families rose 87%; of nonwhites, 130%. If
the decade of the 1960’s is considered, the
rises are 38% among whites, 69% among
nonwhites.

The income of whites exceeds that of
nonwhites, and it is important to ascertain
whether this racial difference has diminished or grown wider. A variety of measures
could be used. We selected three and show
them in Table 8. First, there is the ratio of
median incomes. Second, there is the index
of dissimilarity or delta. Third, is the Gini
index. This is a Lorenz curve measure
which has been frequently used to assess
inequities in income distributions. Its range
differs from that of delta; specifically it
varies from —100 through 0 to +100. A
Gini index of -+100 indicates there is no

overlap of the income distributions of the
two races and that all whites have higher
incomes than any blacks. A value of zero
indicates complete overlap and no racial
differentiation in income, while a value of
—100 means there is no overlap and all
blacks are at higher income levels than any
whites (Miller, 1966, p. 220-221).

The numerical value of the delta and
Gini indices depend upon the number and
breadth of the income categories used in
their computation. Those shown in Table 8
have been calculated from an income distribution composed of six categories. They
cannot be compared to the delta indices
which measure racial differences in education or occupation.

The measures displayed in Table 8 show
that racial differences in family income
have declined. The ratio of nonwhite to
white income has risen and the delta and
Gini indices have fallen which implies increasing similarity of the income distributions.

Different periods have been characterized by different trends. Between 1947 and
the later 1950’s, there was little reduction
in racial differentiation. During the Korean
War years, incomes rose somewhat more
rapidly among nonwhites, but the reverse
was true later in the 1950’s. (Data not
shown in this paper. For further discussion
see: Henson, 1967, Table 1; Weitzman,
1970, Table B.) In the early 1960’s there
was some improvement in nonwhite income
relative to white, but the greatest changes
were concentrated between 1965 and 1969.
For each measure, the gain in the fouryear period following 1965 exceeded that of
the eighteen-year span, 1947 to 1965.

Despite these advances, the income of
nonwhites trails far behind that of whites.
The real purchasing power of the typical
nonwhite family in 1969 was probably no
greater than that of the average white
family fifteen years earlier. The absolute

Demographic Change among Blacks

355

racial difference in purchasing power—as
measured by the difference in median incomes—did not decrease during the 1960’s.

Improvements in income are evident
among both husband-wife families and
those headed by a woman. However, the
relative gains by blacks are greatest among
husband-wife families headed by young
men. For instance, in 1969, Negro husbandwife families headed by a man between 25
and 34 had median incomes 77% as great
as those of comparable white families. This
comes about partially because of the relatively favorable economic position of young
blacks, but also because the proportion of
wives who are in the labor force is greater
among black families than white. When the
comparison is restricted to young husbandwife families in which the wife was not in
the labor force, we discover that black
families had median incomes in 1969 only
70% as large as those of whites (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 1970c, Table 17).
Poverty must be very common among black
families headed by women. In 1969, they
reported a median income of $3,300 and
included an average of two children. Similar
white families—that is, those headed by a
woman—reported a median income of
$5,500 and included an average of only one
child (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1970c,
Table 17; 1971d, Table 4).

Many discussions of contemporary racial
inequities point out that blacks with a
given education or holding a specific job
receive lower incomes than whites with
similar educations or occupations (Siegel,
1965; Duncan, 1969). As an exploratory
study, we analyzed data which permitted
us to assess the relationship of income to
education in 1959 and 1969, That is, using
data for individuals, we regressed reported
income on reported educational attainment
to measure the average payoff in income
for educational attainment. Specifically, we
solved the regression equation, y = a +- bx

where y represents income and x, years of
school completed. The results (based on
U. S. Bureau of the Census, 19635, Tables
6 and 7; 1970c, Table 47) appear in Table
9,

These figures refer to income in 1968
dollars. The average values of y and x
show the increases in education and income
which developed between 1959 and 1969.
For each of the four groups, the correlation coefficient, 7, rose suggesting that the
relationship of income to education became somewhat stronger during the 1960’s.
At present, among men, education accounts
for about 20% of the variance in reported
income.

Regression coefficients, the 6’s, measure
the income received, on the average, for
each year of schooling. The regression coefficients for black men show an improvement between 1959 and 1969 in the income
associated with education. An additional
year of school used to be worth $279, but
by 1968 its value was $433. Simultaneously, the returns white men received
increased, although at a lower rate. As a

result, the racial difference in the payoff for
educational attainment was somewhat less
than at the end of the 1960’s a decade
earlier. Black men at a given education
level still have much smaller incomes than
whites with the same education.

Among women, the picture is quite different. We see that the correlation coefficients are considerably greater for
nonwhites implying a racial difference in
the way in which women use their educations to secure income. It may be that
some black women seek the most lucrative
jobs since their husbands earn relatively
little, while white women may take other
factors into account such as place of employment or timing of the working day.
Between 1959 and 1969, the income returns black women received for education
rose sharply, more rapidly among nonwhites than among whites. Consequently,
nonwhite women receive just about as
much for each year of schooling as do
white women. Overall, of course, nonwhite
females report fewer years of education

than whites and thus they have smaller
incomes.

CONCLUSION

On the basis of figures displayed in this
paper, we conclude that the federal policies
and activities of the 1960’s have failed to
eliminate racial differences in education,
occupation, or income. In every comparison, blacks were at a disadvantage in
both 1970 and 1960. We might speculate
that the programs of this decade would
have their greatest impact upon young
people who recently were attending school
and who joined the labor force within the
last few years. Even if we limit our comparisons to these age groups, we observe
that blacks have finished fewer years of
school, earn less, and hold proportionally
fewer prestigious jobs than do whites of
identical ages.

Apparently, some progress was made between 1960 and 1970 just as it was in the
score of years preceding 1960. Among both
races, educational attainment increased,
the occupational distribution was upgraded, and real purchasing power rose
substantially, In almost every comparison,
the gains were somewhat greater among
blacks than among whites and most indicators of racial differentiation declined.

Demographic Change among Blacks

357

With regard to education, racial differences
in median attainment were sharply reduced. The number of blacks employed as
craftsmen or white collar workers went up
rapidly and the median income of nonwhites increased faster than that of whites.

Nevertheless, as we mentioned previously, very large racial differences remain.
For instance, at the end of the decade,
one-third of all blacks were classed as
impoverished compared to 10% of the
whites, and the median family income of
Negroes was but three-fifths that of whites
(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1970d, Table
1; 1970c, Table 9). These differences, and
similar differences in occupation and education, suggest that even if blacks make
progress during the 1970’s as they did
during the 1960’s, there will still be large
racial differences when the next decennial
census is taken, and blacks will still be at
a disadvantage.
