ABSTRACT: Procedures are presented for estimating from null segments the natural fecundability of
couples who may be practicing contraception. The procedures include an assessment of bias. Also
presented is a new measure designed to bring out the implications for residual fertility of the pregnancy outcome probabilities and fecundability functions recorded for given five-year 2ge classes of
respondents. Application is made to two Taiwan samples featuring segment coded data.

To estimate the impact of program contraception, one needs not only the observed fertility of its clients, but also an estimate of the “‘net”’ potential fertility these
couples might have exhibited had the program not existed. An estimate of the latter
is bound to be speculative because so
much depends on what the analyst as
‘sumes that these couples, who have dem
onstrated family planning initiative, might
have substituted in place of program
methods.

For estimating the impact of contracep
tion from all'sources, private as well as

public, one réquires in addition to the observed fertility of:the contraceptive users
an estimate of their.‘‘gross” potential fertility, that is, their natural fertility. If they
have been practicing induced abortion,
one needs an estimate of their natural fertility as it might be reduced by their willingness to interrupt pregnancies.

A relevant discussion of the relations of
net” and “gross” potential fertility to
natural fertility is found in Bongaarts
(1979) and of ‘‘net”’ versus “‘gross’’ births
averted in Nortman et al. (1978).

sé

As a measure of “gross” potential fertility in the absence of contraception, it is
plainly inadequate to substitute the marital fertility of asample of couples allegedly
cepresenting a regimen of natural fertility.
Such a sample by definition are not practicing induced abortion to a significant degree and, in addition, may represent a
different level of natural fertility than the
population from which the contraceptive
users have come. Moreover, it is now clear
that users of contraception are never a
random sample of the large population of
couples to which they belong. For any
given age they tend to be higher in fecundability (Jain, 1969; Barrett, 1977, 1978)
and lower in proportion sterile (Ridley et
al., 1969; Potter, 1972).

To escape these impasses one would
like to use the contraceptors as their own
control. One strategem (Potter, 1969) has
been to utilize preacceptance fertility rates over some designated duration, such as
three or five years, among those reporting
no contraception during that period.
However, to the extent that initial acceptance of contraception tends to follow

closely a birth, intervals directly preceding
initial acceptance of contraception afford
an inflated measure of fertility and may
vary depending on the length of interval
chosen. Moreover, for age classes
younger than thirty years and given that
acceptance of contraception presupposes
attaining a certain parity, then, as pointed
out by Barrett and Brass (1974), there
tends to be a capitalization on chance factors toward higher-than-average fertility
and therefore a subsequent regression toward the mean by postacceptance potential fertility.

In another analysis, Wolfers (1969) employed as a measure of gross potential fertility in the absence of both contraception
and induced abortion the reciprocals of
“prospective” closed birth intervals of
nonusers classified by wife’s age at start of
the interval. Later Wolfers (1976) abandoned this approach when he found that
such prospective birth intervals tend to
shorten with advancing age, rather than
lengthen, as a consequence of truncation
biases.

Another more elaborate technique to
be evaluated in this paper proceeds in two
main steps. The first step is to derive ‘‘fecundability functions” for five-year classes
by means of a life table analysis applied to
‘null’? segment data. A null segment is a
succession of fecundable months during
which the respondent avows no anticonception practices. By a fecundability function is meant the proportions conceiving
within 1,2, . . . fecundable months after
postpregnancy anovulation in the absence
of contraception. In addition, the combined risk of pregnancy wastage is obtained for each five-year age class from
data on the proportions of pregnancies
terminating in live births, induced abortions, and “other” (i.e., early or late spontaneous pregnancy losses).

A second step is to consider the residual births that might accrue from age x to
end of the reproductive period if the fol
Measuring Potential Fertility 315

lowing conuitions prevail: (1) the fecundability function and risk of pregnancy wastage characteristic of age class x tox + 4
remain fixed to end of the reproductive
period; (2) no contraception 1s practiced;
(3) probability distributions of gestation
and postpregnancy anovulation conditional on outcome of pregnancy remain at
their average values; and (4) risk of secondary sterility operates in a normal agedependent fashion. To implement this inquiry, each pairing of fecundability
function and risk of pregnancy wastage
characteristic of a particular five-year age
group must be inserted into a large model
whose structure will be detailed later. To
emphasize its hypothetical nature, the resultant measure of residual cumulative
fertility will be called a “residual fertility
projection.”

The present approach may be considered more versatile than previous ones for
being able to encompass differing levels of
dependence upon induced abortion.
However, this approach cannot be justified unless one can control reasonably well
the biases attending null segments. The
Taiwan data available for the present
analysis are rich enough to permit comparing fecundability functions and residual fertility projections within a classification of age, parity, and family planning
status (spacing desired births versus preventing further childbearing).

In the next section, major suspected
biases associated with null segments are
identified and a plan for assessing them
outlined. Later sections treat data, pregnancy outcome probabilities, fecundability functions, and finally their structuring
into residual fertility projections.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
RATIONALE

The present approach presupposes segment coding based on a monthly time unit.
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

316 Potter et al.

Exposure to childbearing is ideally coded
into segments of gestation and postpregnancy anovulation, classified by outcome of pregnancy, and segments of fecundable exposure partitioned into null
segments and segments of contraceptive
use. If contraception 1s not being practiced, a null segment begins when postpregnancy anovulation ends. If contraception is being practiced during fecundable
exposure, a null segment begins when that
contraception is discontinued. A null segment may itself be terminated either by
the start of a segment of contraception use
or by any of the events terminating the
respondent’s fertility history such as
divorce, separation, sterilization, menopause, loss to follow-up, or study cut-off.
As a concrete illustration, suppose that
after a birth there ensues a contraceptive
segment lasting C, months (C, longer than
the period of postpartum anovulation),
followed succesively by a m-month null
segment, a second contraceptive segment
of C, months, and finally a second n
“month null segment ending in pregnancy.

The two null segments are each assigned
to that five-year age class to which the wife
belonged at its inception. As contributions to the life table analyses of fecundability, the first null segment is coded as
spanning ordinal months 1 to m, the second as spanning ordinal months 1 to (not
ordinal months m + 1 to m + n). This
coding conventton, which greatly simplified the data processing, may be suspected
of introducing a bias toward slow conception inasmuch as the second null segment
women are necessarily women who have
“survived” the first segment and are
therefore selected for lower fecundability
on that account. Fortunately, the severity
of this bias, which is tested below, appears
to be slight.

Null segments afford the raw material
from which, by means of a life table analysis (Mode et al., 1977), fecundability func

tions are estimated; but in this role null
segments are subject to three further putative biases, all tending to reduce apparent
fecundability. First, never-users of contraception who demonstrate to themselves
their subfecundity by slowness to conceive
may feel less demographic pressure and
therefore be less likely to adopt contraception for the first time at a given parity
than more rapid conceivers, while everusers of contraception who suspect that
they might have become sterile or subfecund are likely to shift into a nonuser status. Without special controls, both groups
may figure disproportionately in null segments. Second, errors in the reported timing of contraception can result in segments
of ostensible nonuse that in fact are
affected by contraception. This bias has
been proposed as a leading cause of the
sizable differences typically found between conceptive delays occuring in the
reported absence of contraception and
those reported as following deliberate interruptions of contraception (Potter et al.,
1963). A third possible bias arises from the
deliberate concealment of induced abortion, evidence for which in Taiwan is cited
by Chi et al. (1972) and by Tietze and
Dawson (1973). Here one does not know
how relatively often the time involved in
the unwanted pregnancy and its conceiving is reported as a span of successful contraception or as a period of failure to conceive despite not practicing contraception.

Presumably these data problems would
not be serious for a sample of youthful
spacers practicing little contraception or
abortion. Respecting family limiters, one
would hope that a prospective study design would attenuate at least that source of
bias resulting from miscoded times of contraceptive use.

By restricting the set of null segments
to those that either themselves are ended
by conception or else are followed evenDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

Vol. 26, No. 4

tually by a contraceptive or null segment
that does, one can expect to lessen the
force of all four biases. By so delimiting
the set of null segments, one selects
against natural sterility and serious subfecundity, misallocation of contraceptive
use times, and against concealment of induced abortion. Indeed, an excessive
compensation may be suspected, especially when the segment-coded fertility
histories are brief. If a null segment starts
shortly before the survey cut-off date for
example, then conception has to be rapid
in order for that null segment to qualify for
inclusion in the restricted set of “‘closed”’
null segments. The attempt to escape four
negative biases has allowed the entrance
of a positive one, namely truncation bias,
whose capacity to distort interval variables was convincingly demonstrated by
Sheps et al. (1970).

In sum, subjecting any full set of null
segments to a life table analysis may be
suspected of exaggerating the slowness of
conception. The resultant estimates of cumulative proportions conceiving within
specified numbers of fecundable months
may be construed as probably understating true proportions. Alternatively, when
the life table analysis is confined to a subset of “‘closed”’ null segments, the estimated proportions conceiving within
specified numbers of fecundable months
may be suspected of overstating the true
proportions.

DATA

Data come from two Taiwan surveys
that provide segment coding subclassified
by age of wife, parity, and family planning
status (spacer or limiter). ‘““Spacers’’ are
couples who according to the wife’s report
are practicing contraception in order to
delay an eventually desired birth; limiters
are practicing contraception to prevent
any futher childbearing. The 1973 islandwide “KAP IV” Study features retrospec
 

Measuring Potential Fertility 317

tive interviews of about 5,600 currently
married women of reproductive age. Increasing the representativeness of this
sample is a very low refusal rate. To
enhance its calibre, segment coding was
confined to the last five years before interview or back to marriage, whichever is
less. Quality of data is discussed in Freedman etal. (1974). Detection of physiological sterility depends on a question concerning menopause.

The present anlaysis uses that part of
KAP IV data pertaining to spacers of parities 0, 1, or 2. Because of the low level of
contraceptive practice among these spacers, over 95 per cent of the coded segments represent gestation, postpartum
anovulation, or else null segments. Given
such a low level of contraceptive usage,
one can be confident that the four sources
of bias described above do not seriously
affect KAP IV data.

RESULTS

The top three panels of Table 1 distinguish parities zero, one, and two, each
subdivided into four five-year age classes
(20-24 to 35-39 years of age), though subsample sizes are comfortably large only
for the two younger groups. Presented in
the table are the frequencies of pregnancy
outcomes classified into live birth, induced abortion, and ‘other’ (spontaneous abortion or stillbirth). The incidence of ‘“‘other,”’ around 5 per cent, is
well below the 13-23 per cent encountered
in several specialized surveys of spontaneous fetal wastage (Leridon, 1977, Table
4.5). The reported rates of induced abortion are near zero. There is little differentiation of fetal loss rates between age
classes 20-24 and 25~29 years, or among
the parities distinguished.

A second source of segment-coded
data is the Taichung Medical IUD Followup Study. In this longitudinal study, the

original sample consisted of 5,832 Taichung women who had an IUD inserted
between July, 1962, and May, 1965. By
1971, six-to nine-year histories had been
collected, based on annual contacts, from
84 per cent of the original sample. Of women lost to follow-up, three-quarters are
known to have moved from Taichung.
The study has utilized clinical as well as
survey methods. If the women were
known to be wearing the original JUD,
they were asked to return to the clinic for
examination. Otherwise they were interviewed at their homes on a yearly basis.
The sample of wives averaged 4.79
births at time of original IUD insertion.
Of this group, 82 per cent accepted their
first device for purposes of family limitation. ‘““The acceptors were characteristically women of high fertility who had less
than average use of contraceptives prior to
insertion, but who had resorted to induced
abortion in greater numbers than the

relatively high demographic pressure to
prevent additional births” (Moots, 1975,
p. 73).

A limitation of the Taichung data is
failure to code length of postpartum
amenorrhea as a surrogate for postpartum
anovulation. To cope with this problem,
null segments immediately following a live
birth are excluded from analysts. While
this strategem may reduce contamination
from anovulation, it hardly elimates it and
therefore may account for an additional
small drag downward upon apparent fecundability.

A majority of the fertility histories are
closed by the 1971 cut-off date, most of the
remainder by separation, divorce, widowhood, sterilization, moves away from
Taichung, or menopause. The last code
plainly fails to exhaust the class of naturally sterile couples.

The Taichung data will be used to represent the experience of limiters for age
classes 25-29, 30-34, and 35-39 years.

Owing to their extensive practice of contraception, the 4,782 Taichung limiters report only slightly more than 3,000 pregnancies after their intial IUD, less than
one per woman. A majority of pregnancies were ostensibly conceived during contraceptive rather than null segments. The
bottom panel of Table 1 gives information
about pregnancy outcomes. As compared
to KAP IV spacers, Taichung limiters exhibit a relatively high induced abortion
rate as well as more complete reporting of
their spontaneous pregnancy losses. Indeed, the incidence of live births is below
half for all three age classes and actually is
exceeded by the reported incidence of induced abortion in the two older age
classes. Such high rates of induced abortion occurring mostly in the first trimester
of pregnancy must mean that an appreciable fraction of potential spontaneous
pregnancy terminations are anticipated by
abortion procedures (Potter et al., 1975).

Accordingly, the reported rates of spontaneous pregnancy losses, varying from 0.09
to 0.11, are high enough to suggest relatively complete reporting, though the possibility cannot be excluded that some induced abortions are being disguised as
spontaneous ones. Induced abortion was
illegal throughout the period of the Taichung Study, though the relevant statute
was never strictly enforced.

the Taichung Study is furnished in Table

such as separation, divorce, loss-tofollow-up, study cut-off, and the like. Intermediate and constituting a subset of the
“open set” is the ‘‘closed set” of null segments which includes all the null segments

ending in pregnancy or else followed by a

contraceptive or null segment that does.
This restriction reduces numbers of segments from 25 to over 40 per cent, the reduction becoming larger with older age.
The narrowest set comprises a subset of
the closed set restricted to first null segments following the initial IUD that
qualified the wife for inclusion into the
study. This second restriction further reduces numbers by about a quarter. Thus,

in the closed set of null segments, three
quarters are “initial”? segments, three
quarter are “subsequent.” Note that “‘initial’ and “subsequent” is being defined
here for six- to nine-year reproductive histories, not for birth intervals.

The relative brevity of null segments
ending in a return to IUD use reflects the
high IUD reinsertion rates, especially after an involuntary expulsion, with many of
these reinsertions occuring after only a
few days. Though not shown in Table 2,
the median lengths of null segments ending in an IUD insertion are 1.0 or 2.0
months in all three age classes.

segments ending in pregnnacy, the distinction between ‘“‘open” and “‘closed’’ sets
disappears. Moreover, one notes that the
addition of subsequent segments to initial
ones scarcely changes the means and variances. One would not expect this near lack
of change if either the suspected biases
from overlap with postpartum anovulation or from the manner of-coding ordinal
months of null segments were having serious consequences. On the other hand, it
must be admitted that the other suspected
biases—concealment of induced abortion,
misallocation of contraceptive segments,
or self-selection of wives suspecting subfecundity—could be operating equally on
initial and subsequent null segments.

 

FECUNDABILITY FUNCTIONS

By a life table method (Mode and
Soyka, 1977), null segments have been
transformed into fecundability functions
furnishing estimated cumulative proportions conceiving within specified numbers
of fecundable months in the reported absence of contraception. With the exception of those immediately following a
birth, all null segments are utilized to give
the lower bound estimates of cumulative
proportions conceiving that are assembled |
in Table 3. Although more detailed output
is available, it suffices to represent
coefficients for a few chosen durations.
The six-year cumulative proportions re

quired extrapolation of one year in the
case of KAP IV data since in this study
segment coding was extended back only
five years. These extrapolations change
results only in the third decimal place if at
all. No such extrapolation was required
respecting Taichung coefficients, six years
being the minimum duration between first
interview and study cut-off date. The corresponding fecundability functions based
on “‘closed”’ null segments are presented
in Table 4.

In Table 3, the lower bound estimates
of fecundability among KAP IV spacers
exhibit very little decline between ages
20-24 and 25-29 years and only slightly
more decline between ages 25-29 and
30-34 years. It is to be kept in mind that
the last age class is represented by perilously small numbers. With regard to parity, among women ages 20-24 years, the
proportions conceiving within six months
decreases from a high of 0.681 for zero
parity women to 0.498 for second parity
women, yet the proportions conceiving
within six years show the opposite trend.

These opposing trends may reflect the
joint operation of two quite distinct mechanisms, one affecting the level of fecundability among nonsterile couples and the
other affecting the proportions sterile.
The difference in six-month conception
rates may arise because women of lower
parity by virtue of shorter marriage durations average higher coital rates and therefore higher fecundability if not sterile than
do higher parity women, even while belonging to the same five-year age class. On
the other hand, with a mean age of marriage near 20, having a second child while
still not yet 25 years of age selects for a recent birth and therefore less sterility,
thereby perhaps accounting for such a
high proportion conceiving within six
years among second parity spacers aged
20-24,

The fact that among the several spacer

 

Social Biology

subsamples, the proportions conceiving
within six years vary around a value of
0.93, and thus well short of 1.0, suggests
the presence of some subfecundity and
natural sterility. Indeed, for the zero parity wives, a proportion of 0.93 implies a
primary sterility rate of 0.07 which is high
relative to general experience, thereby
suggesting a bias from the inclusion of
contraceptive use time in some null segments owing to segment misallocation.
Turning to the Taichung limiters, we
were surprised to find a fecundability
function for women aged 25-29 years so
similar to those of first and second parity
KAP IV spacers of the same age class. We
had expected that the apparent fecundability of limiters would show the effect of
stronger downward biases. Practice of
contraception did not become common
among Taiwan spacers until after 1970
(Sun et al., 1978) and most of the spacing
experience of KAP IV women took place
well before 1970. In contrast, to become
eligible for inclusion in the Taichung
Study, a couple had to accept an IUD.
Moreover the subsequent experience of
this sample has involved extensive use of
contraception and induced abortion.
Thus, there would appear to be much
more opportunity for unreported induced
abortion and misallocated contraceptive
segments among Taichung limiters than
among KAP IV spacers; and indeed these
sources of negative bias may have contributed to the rather steep decline of apparent fecundability with increasing age
seen for the Taichung limiters in Table 3.
Nevertheless, compensating for these .
stronger negative biases in the Taichung
sample may be a selection toward higher
than average fecundability. This selection
would be especially strong in the 25-29
age class because of the fact that acceptance of the original IUD so often followed
closely a childbirth, an event selecting
against being already sterile or even seDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

riously subfecund. Concurrently, the underreporting of spontaneous fetal losses
among KAP IV spacers, demonstrated in
Table 1, would be depressing their apparent fecundability. Thus, the similarity
between spacers’ and limiters’ fecundability for age class 25-29 years may represent
a balancing of biases rather than their absence.

By the very nature of the subsets of null
segments underlying Table 4, the proportions conceiving within six years have to
be essentially 1.0. Hence the largest contrasts between Tables 3 and 4 occur for
those subsamples which in Table 3 have
the lowest fecundability functions. Table 4
differentials within the spacer and limiter
samples are identical in pattern to those of
Table 3 but weaker. Close similarity continues to exist for women aged 25-29 years
between the apparent fecundabilities of
KAP IV first-and second-parity spacers
and Taichung limiters.

How serious are the divergences between Tables 3 and 4 for estimating potential fertility? An answer is best obtained
by substituting the alternative pair of fecundability functions into an appropriate
index of potential fertility that keeps other
relevant factors constant, as is shown below.

RESIDUAL FERTILITY PROJECTIONS

Needed is an exploratory index of potential residual fertility that will reflect as
directly as possible the pregnancy outcome proportions of Table 1 (interpreted
as probabilities) and the fecundability
functions of Table 3 or Table 4. Any family-building model requires additional elements before it can generate estimates of
residual fertility. These elements include:
(1) a base age x from which to reckon residual fertility; (2) specification of the reproductive state or states occupied at that
base age; (3) lengths of gestation and
anovulation conditional upon outcome of

 

Measuring Potential Fertility 323

pregnancy; and (4) ages at onset of secondary sterility.

Gestational lengths conditional on outcome of pregnancy are coded in both the
KAP IV and Taichung studies. Postabortion and poststillbirth anovulation are not
coded, but they are so trivialiy short that
assumptions about them have little capacity for distortion. The coding of menopausal status fails egregiously to capture
the full scope of primary and secondary
sterility. Used in its place will be the fecundity decrement table of Pittenger
(1973). The cost in objectivity of this borrowing is reduced by the fact that the
course of natural sterility, barring situations where venereal disease is rife, appears to be fairly constant from one population to another. At least the few
empirical age curves, which Pittenger fits
by an exponential function, do not indicate otherwise.

Another unavoidable borrowing is a
function for postpartum anovulation. The
theoretical curve most often used is a Pascal distribution originally proposed by
Barrett (1969), comprising a sum of two
geometric random variates whose common parameter governs the mean length
of the distribution generated. On the basis
of auxiliary information (Jain et al., 1977)
this mean has been set at 11 (in months)
and for convenience is assumed constant
for all ages. .

There remains the problem that for
KAP IV spacers there are adequate data
to estimate the pregnancy outcome probabilities or fecundability functions of age
classes exceeding thirty years and a corresponding difficulty for Taichung limiters
older than forty years. An index of residual potential fertility has been chosen
which avoids the need for extrapolation,
namely, the mean number of residual
births to be expected from age x to end of
the reproductive period (as limited by secondary sterility) if the pregnancy outcome

probabilities and fecundability functions
observed for age class x tox + 4 were to
continue unchanged until secondary
sterility. Thus, pregnancy outcome probabilities and the fecundability function are
being exempted from aging (as is true for
postpartum anovulation as well). Aging
enters only through secondary sterility,
the conditional risks of which rise with
wife’s age according to Pittenger’s curve.

Base age x is taken as 20, 25, 30, or 35
years as the case may be. It is further assumed that at exact age x all women have
just given birth and therefore are entering
the state of postpartum anovulation. This
reproductive state is chosen because so often first acceptance or resumption of contraception follows closely a birth.

To emphasize its difference from a conventional total fertility rate, the index is
called a “residual fertility projection.” Its
purpose is not a realistic assessment of re
sidual potential fertility, but to quantify
the implications for residual fertility of a
given set of pregnancy outcome probabilities and fecundability function observed
for a particular five year age group.
Among other competitive exploratory indices, it has the advantage of being easy to
compute.

A technical description of the stochastic family-building model generating these
residual fertility projections is found in the
Appendix. In this model, couples move
cyclically through sequences of fecundable, gestational, and postpregnant anovulatory states until entrance into the absorbing state of secondary sterility.
Passage from pregnancy to postpregnancy
anovulation marks the occurrence of a
pregnancy termination. These pregnancy
terminations and, more particularly, live
births may be cumulated and averaged for
the entire cohort. What are being called

Vol. 26, No. 4

residual fertility projections are simply the
per capita live births cumulated in this
fashion.

Any borrowing of data or of theoretical
curves impairs the strict objectivity of the
procedure. However, the objectivity
sacrificed is not great provided that the
borrowed reproductive factor is minor in
its impact (e.g., postabortion or poststillbirth anovulation), or is relatively constant from one population to another (age
at onset of physiological sterility), or is reducible to a single parameter curve whose
specification is guided by data specific to
the population of interest (e.g., postpartum anovulation). What is important,
then, is that the two most problematic factors in the sense of having large impacts
and being highly variable from one population to another—namely, natural fecundability and probabilities of pregnancy
outcomes—are being estimated from
data.

In Table 5 are collected for comparision nine pairs of residual fertility projections. While sharing the same set of pregnancy outcome probabilities (and the
same Sterility and postpartum anovulatory
functions), the lower projection of any
pair reflects a fecundability function from
Table 3 while the higher projection draws
its fecundability function from Table 4.

The differences between lower and upper bounds prove quite large. Expressed
as a percentage of the lower bound, the
difference between the two tends to increase with a greater base age.

The reduction in residual fertility projections with increasing base age reflects
the reduced marriage duration over which
residual births are being accumulated.
Among limiters, diminishing live birth
probabilities and decreasing fecundability
also contribute to the decline of residual
fertility. Largely accounting for the lower
residual fertility projections of limiters
than spacers are the former’s much higher
probabilities of fetal loss.

Measuring Potential Fertility

325

The residual fertility projections of
Table 5 carry interesting implications. Respecting spacers, the absence of contraception assures that relatively few fecundable months are required for conception,
especially if the fecundability functions of
Table 4 are employed. These short conceptive delays guarantee numerous pregnancies, most of which end in live births,
to yield high residual fertility projections.
If the proportions of pregnancies ending
in live births are overestimated owing to
an underreporting of fetal losses, there is
compensatory inflation of the conceptive
delays from the same cause. The number
of residual births projected depends
closely on the base age because depending
whether it is 20, 25, or 30 years, the corresponding residual reproductive periods
average in the vicinities of 25, 20, and 15
years.

A very different picture emerges for
limiters. The absence of contraception occasions the same relatively quick course of
conception, again especially when predicated upon the fecundability functions of
Table 4. A large number of pregnancies
per capita can be expected on these
grounds alone; but increasing their numbers further are the deliberate interruptions of half of all pregnancies by induced
abortion, with each interruption abbreviating gestation length as well as
eliminating a segment of postpartum
anovulation, thereby producing more fecundable months in which to conceive. Indeed, total projected pregnancies among
the three age classes of Taichung limiters
are roughly double the projected numbers
of residual births. Stated otherwise, when
the base age is as young as 25, then an appreciable number of residual births can be
projected despite half of all pregnancies
being deliberately interrupted because of
the very fact that the combination of so
many abortions together with no contraception produces such a high number of
pregnancies.

DISCUSSION

From the comparison of Tables 3 and 4,
it is plain that the fecundability functions
derived from the unrestricted set of null
segments are quite different from those
constructed from the restricted subsets of
“closed”? null segments. As a consequence, among subsamples of KAP IV
spacers, differences between lower and
upper bound projections of residual fertility, using unrestricted and restricted sets
of null segments respectively, are roughly
two births. Although of smaller absolute
values, these differences among Taichung
limiters when expressed as percentages of
the lower bound are large, exceeding 100
per cent for the 35-39 age class. What is
plainly implied, then, is that any estimates
of gross potential fertility derived through
use of null segments will be sensitive to
one’s choice of procedure and in particular to the decision of whether to use a restricted or unrestricted set of null segments.

A related question is whether the
downward biases (selection for subfecundity, incorrect reporting of contraception
practice times and nonreporting of induced abortion) that are probably depressing the lower bound projections of
Table 5 are stronger or weaker than the
truncation biases that are presumably
inflating the corresponding upper bound
projections. An independent check relevant to the spacer subsample is available
from a 1953 fertility survey undertaken in
Yunlin, a rural district of Taiwan (Tuan,
1958). That the date of interview was early
enough so that couples aged 45 years or
older were practicing little birth control is
strongly supported by a mean age at last
confinement of around 40 years. Women
aged 50 to 64 years whose first marriage
was still intact at age 50 averaged 7.6
births. Mean age of marriage for the 45-64
year old group is reported as 19 years.
Hence, adjustment for a base age of 20

 

Social Biology

years directly followed by a period of postpartum anovulation implies a residual fertility of around 7.0 births, barely higher
than the lower bound projections given in
Table 5 for KAP IV spacers age 20-24
years.

However, to claim no downward bias,
the lower bound projection for spacers
20-24 years of age would have to exceed
the relevant total fertility rate of the
Yunlin sample because of exempting fecundability and risk of pregnancy loss
from aging effects. This not being the case,
it seems necessary to concede that the
lower bound estimates of Table 5 for spacers carry some downward bias, unless
one is prepared to argue either that the
Pittenger sterility curve is overestimating
Sterility or that lactation amenorrhea was
shorter in the earlier period. In any case,
the authors lean toward the proposition
that, at least for spacers, the unrestricted
null segments offer a better glimpse into
fecundability functions than the restricted
ones.

A firm conclusion is not-possible concerning which bounds, those of Table 3 or
4, are closer to the true fecundability functions of the Taichung limiters. No independent check comparable to the Yunlin
fertililty survey is available. For example,
in an interesting analysis of Taichung data
based on a highly simplified familybuilding model of Sheps, Sullivan et al,
(1976) concluded that induced abortion is
lowering fertility by 12 per cent, but their
estimate is predicated on observed levels
of contraception and applies only to a.
single calendar year, 1968, in the history
of the study sample.

It has already been suggested that the
similarity of the fecundability functions
estimated for Taichung limiters aged
25-29 to those of the first and second parity KAP IV counterparts may have rested
on a balancing of positive and negative
biases. For reasons given in the text, it is
hypothesized that those two sets of biases

are stronger for the limiters than the spacers.

APPENDIX

The purpose of this Appendix is to give a
brief outline of the algorithms used in calculating the residual fertility projections presented
in Table $. All the algorithms used in these
calculations have been published elsewhere
(see Mode and Soyka, 1977). In what follows,
all equation numbers will refer to those in the
paper just cited.

Given the computer input as described in
the main body of this paper, the calculations
yielding the numbers in Table 5 proceeded in
steps. The first step was to calculate a matrix
function A(x,¢) of the form displayed in Equation (2.1) for each row in Table 5. The procedure used in carrying out these calculations has
been described in Sections 8 and 9 of Mode and
Soyka (1977). For each matrix function A(x,2)
so calculated, x = 20, 25, 30, and 35, corresponding to the age classes in Table 5. For each
fixed x in A(x,f), the f-variable ran on a
monthly scale till that time corresponding to
age 50. If, for example, x = 20, then the rvariable ran over a 30-year span, or, equivalently, from 1 to 360.

The next step in the calculations was to
calculate an age-dependent distribution function, H(x,t), defined as follows. Given that a
birth is experienced at f = 0 when a woman is
age x, H(x,t) is the conditional probability the
next birth occurs sometime during the time interval (0,1), ¢ > 0. This distribution function
was basic to the discussion, because the
measure of residual fertility used in this paper
was based on the notion of an age-dependent
renewal process governed by the conditional
distribution function H(x, ft).

In such a renewal process, H(x,f) is inter
preted as the conditional distribution function
of the waiting times among live births. Let
u(x,t) be the mean number of live births experienced during the closed time interval (0,1),
given that a birth was experienced tf = 0 whena
woman was age x. Observe that the birth occurring att = Ois included in v(x,f). The residual fertility function used in this paper was
defined by

R(x,1) = v(x, - 1, (A.1)

i.e., the birth at ¢ = 0 was not counted. The
values of R(x,t) reported in Table 5 were
R(x,50-x) forx = 20, 25, 30, and 35.

A theoretical expression for u(x,t) in terms
of H(x,t) was given in Equation (3.11), where,
in this case, the age-dependent convolutions
on the right are to be interpreted as convolu
tions of Hfx,t) with itself. The mean function
u(x,t) was computed in terms of its density

function (x,t), where

v{x,t) = f m(x,s)ds. (A.2)

The density m(x,t), in turn, was actually computed on a discrete lattice of < x,t > — points,
using Littman’s algorithm.

This algorithm is merely the recursion formula,

m(x,t) = Dynles)h(x + 5,8), (A.3)

Be

defined for t > 1, where m(x,0) = 1 for all x.
In (A.3) the function h(x, f) is the density h(x,t)
= H(x,t)- H(x,t-1),t > 1, with H(x,0) = Ofor
all x. An up-to-date matrix version of
Littman’s algorithm has been presented in the
appendix of Mode and Pickens (1979). The

principles outlined there can easily be extended to derive formula (A.3). It should also
be mentioned that a matrix verion of Littman’s
algorithm was used to solve the system of equations in (3.9), during the course of the calculations leading to H(x,t).
