ABSTRACT: Within SES categories in the United States, racial and ethnic minorities generally
fare less well on a variety of health-related indicators than do majority groups. Important
differences exist within subgroups, however, and at present, these differences are poorly understood. In this paper we address Hispanic subgroup (Cuban American, Mexican American,
Puerto Rican, and Central/South American) differences in utilization of prenatal care. Data from
the 1986 and 1987 national Linked Birth/Infant Death files are used to assess patterns of prenatal
care utilization across subgroups. Using Kotelchuck’s Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization
Index, we find that when controlling for other factors, Cuban American and Puerto Rican
women are more likely to obtain adequate care than are Hispanic women of Mexican or
Central/South American origin. Other factors important in understanding utilization patterns
include marital status, education level, birthplace, and region of the country. We conclude with
a discussion of the relatively weak link between prenatal care and birth outcomes and identify
important cultural factors that may be important in understanding why this relationship is not
stronger.

Despite important advances in suggest that the gap between social
health care in recent years, substantial classes will only increase, and that unclass and race/ethnic differences in less major changes occur, the disadmorbidity and mortality remain. In vantaged working and living conditions

as a surrogate for the former, Williams
et al. (1994) demonstrate that the two
are not equivalent and that both must
be considered in addressing questions
of vulnerability and need.

A simple recognition of the disparities that exist, however, does not
mean that we understand what produces them, or, more importantly, that
we know how to develop equitable and
effective policies for their redress. Several researchers have noted the need
for additional work that addresses the
specific factors that contribute to group
differences in morbidity and mortality
(Novella et al., 1991; Williams et al.,
1994).

This paper addresses a modest piece
of this larger research agenda by examining one major health indicator—the
nature and quality of prenatal care received by pregnant women—for one
U.S. ethnic minority, women of
Hispanic/Latino origin. This health indicator is accepted as one of the better
overall measures of access to health
care and one that is linked to what are
typically used as sentinel events to describe the health status of a given
population—infant mortality and the
number of infants with low birthweight
(Warner, 1991). Our focus on the
Hispanic/Latino population is based on
the recognition that it is one of the
most medically underserved groups in
the United States (Marks et al., 1990)
and one that is seriously understudied

(Novella et al., 1991). In addition, be
cause of the growing evidence of
differences in health outcomes among
the major Hispanic subgroups—
differences that clearly have important
policy relevance—additional research
making intragroup comparisons clearly
is needed.

BACKGROUND

SES AND RacE/ETHNIC DIFFERENCES
IN PRENATAL CARE AND BIRTH
OUTCOMES

Perhaps no area has yielded more
substantial evidence of the relative disadvantage of the poor and race/ethnic
minorities than has research on birth
outcomes. While overall rates of low
birthweight and infant mortality have
declined, the gap between those of
higher and lower socioeconomic class
and between majority and racial minority populations has remained (Antonovsky and Bernstein, 1977; Brooks,
1975; Floyd, 1992; Markides and
Barnes, 1977; Markides and McFarland, 1982; Moss and Carver, 1992).
Clearly, the goal of bringing the life
chances for children born to more disadvantaged groups in line with the
more advantaged will not be achieved
so long as SES remains a clear indicator of likelihood of adverse outcomes
and so long as the mortality for some
minority groups remains approximately twice as high as for whites (Alexander and Cornely, 1987; Cramer,
1987; Gee, Lee, and Forthofer, 1976;
Geronimus, 1987; Geronimus and
Bound, 1990; Hummer, 1993; National
Center for Health Statistics, 1992;
Yankauer, 1990).

Efforts to improve birthweight and
mortality rates among infants must focus on those events for which causal
links have been most clearly estab
lished. It has been assumed for a num
ber of years that quality prenatal care
is one such event and that improving
care is a cost-effective way to decrease
the occurrence of low weight births
and neonatal and infant mortality
(Brown, 1988; Committee to Study

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

40 Albrecht and Miller

Low Birthweight, 1985; Frank et al.,
1992; U.S. Congress, 1988). To the extent this assumption holds, improving
access to prenatal care remains an important goal so long as a significant
number of infant births occur to
women who delay care until at least the
second or third trimester of pregnancy
or who do not receive prenatal care at
all (National Center for Health Statistics, 1991).

A number of variables have been
identified in the research literature as
important correlates of the nature of
prenatal care received (see, for example, Ingram et al., 1986; Institute of
Medicine, 1985; 1988). Cramer (1987)
has noted that single mothers and highschool dropouts have significantly
higher rates of obtaining late or no
prenatal care. Others have focused on
what they define as the major obstacles
to care. Harvey and Faber (1993), for
example, categorize the primary obstacles as either financial (such as lack of
health insurance, transportation problems, and problems with child care) or
personal (such as ambivalence about
the pregnancy, excessive physical or
psychological stress, and negative attitudes toward health professionals).

A number of these financial and personal barriers are directly related to individual socioeconomic circumstances
or to race/ethnicity. The result is that
prenatal care underutilization continues to be more pronounced among
the most disadvantaged (St. Clair et
al., 1989). Thus, bringing the task of
improving birth outcomes into the
broader arena of the development of
policies and programs to improve the
health and health care opportunities
of the underserved remains one of our
most important challenges (Floyd,
1992).

Social Biology

THE IMPORTANCE OF EXAMINING
HISPANIC SUBGROUPS

Recent evidence on the differences
among Hispanic subgroups makes it increasingly important that they be considered separately for both research
and policy development purposes.
Hispanics of Mexican, Puerto Rican,
Cuban, and other Central and South
American origin differ markedly on
major demographic, economic, social,
and health characteristics (Angel and
Worobey, 1991; Bean and Tienda,
1987; Frisbie and Bean, 1993; Mendoza et al., 1991). These differences
are large enough that analyses -based
on pooled samples can be clearly misleading.

However, only limited research has
addressed the major health-related
subgroup differences, particularly as
these differences are reflected in patterns of prenatal care and birth outcomes. Hummer et al. (1992), for example, note that because of the
homogeneity in national origin of the
larger Hispanic subgroups in some
states and the lack of large Hispanic
populations in others, less attention
has been directed to possible birthweight and mortality differences for
Hispanic births. Both Hummer et al.
(1992) and Becerra et al. (1991) found
significant heterogeneity in how the
different Hispanic subgroups use the
health care system as well as significant
differences in outcomes. In both studies, infants of Puerto Rican descent
were at a higher risk of low birthweight
and neonatal mortality, while the opposite was true for Cuban-American
infants.

Other studies report similar findings. For example, in an analysis of vital records from the State of Illinois,

Vol. 43, No. 1-2

Collins and Shay (1994) found that the
proportion of low birthweight Hispanic
infants ranged from 4.3 per cent for
Mexicans to 9.1 per cent for Puerto Ricans (the number of Cuban respon
dents was insufficient for separate anal
ysis). Similarly, Cohen et al. (1993),
using Massachusetts birth certificate
data, observed wide variation among
Hispanic subgroups, with the highest
level of risk for negative birth outcomes occurring among Puerto Ricans.

Finally, Albrecht et al. (1994), using
national linked birth/infant death
records to assess the influence of a
number of sociodemographic and medical care variables on prematurity, low

birthweight, and mortality, also report

significant differences among  subgroups. The most consistent finding
was the relatively advantaged position
of Cuban-Americans and the relatively
disadvantaged position of Puerto Ricans. Multivariate models indicated
that while some of the subgroup differences are due to distinct sociodemographic profiles, other differences remained even when controlling for
these factors.

While these studies have examined
patterns of low birthweight and infant
mortality among Hispanic subgroups,
similar comparisons of prenatal care
are less evident. Research on prenatal
care among Hispanics overall suggests
that, excluding Cubans, only about 60
per cent of Hispanic women initiate
prenatal care in the first trimester,
compared with 80 per cent of nonHispanic white women. Non-Cuban
origin Hispanics are also three times
more likely to receive no prenatal care
at all, at least as measured through
contact with the formal health care system (Council on Scientific Affairs,
1991). Thus, as a group, they tend to

 

Prenatal Care 41

be significant underutilizers of preventive health services (Marks et al.,
1990).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This study will address the utilization of prenatal care by Hispanic subgroups in the United States. Prior research suggests that the differential
use of prenatal care from one group to
another is a contributor to observed
differences in birth outcomes (Frank
et al., 1992). However, further understanding of this linkage is dependent
upon research that addresses the question of the degree to which subgroup
differences exist and an assessment of
their potential causes.

DaTA SOURCE

To address our research questions,
we use data from the 1986 and 1987 national Linked Birth/Infant Death data
set (National Center for Health Statistics, 1992). This data set contains information on births to Hispanic women
in the United States and includes an
identifier that allows examination of
the major Hispanic subgroups. Two
years of data were used to provide sample sizes within the subgroups that
were sufficient for multivariate analysis.

The Linked Birth/Infant Death file
is based on two existing data sources:
state files for the identification of
linked birth and infant death certificates and NCHS natality and mortality
computerized statistical files, the
source of computer records for the two
linked certificates. The NCHS natality
and mortality files are produced annually and include statistical data from
birth and death certificates that are
provided to NCHS by states under the

Vital Statistics Cooperative Program.
State data are coded according to uniform specification. The national linked
data set consists of two separate files
for each year. The first file includes
linked records of live births and infant
deaths for the individual birth cohort.
The second file is the live birth file for
the given year. The files are compiled
as a numerator/denominator data set
to allow users the means to compute
infant mortality rates. The 1986 birth
cohort included 390,191 births and
3,292 infant deaths; the 1987 birth cohort included 407,225 births and 3,363
infant deaths.

The linked birth/death data set contains specific information that allows
one to determine the nature of prenatal care received (timing, number of
prenatal care visits, source of care), as
well as information on parental sociodemographic characteristics and other
pertinent predictors of care utilization
and birth outcomes. However, there
are also important limitations imposed
by the data. For example, the quality
of the information obtained on the
birth certificate has always been a matter of concern. To cite just one example, data on gestational age, if reported
incorrectly, can result in an overstatement of the effects of prenatal care on
birth outcomes due to the positive association between the use of more prenatal care among women who have
longer gestational periods. For this
reason, the magnitude of the effects of
prenatal care may sometimes be overStated.

Additionally, specific information
on such theoretically relevant indicators as family income, access to medical care, or family structure characteristics is not included. As a result, some

of the most important potential predictors of prenatal care utilization among
Hispanic groups are not available.
Nonetheless, these data provide a
starting point for making Hispanic
subgroup comparisons and will allow
us, through our focus on predictors of
prenatal care utilization, to add to the
work of Becerra et al. (1991), and
Hummer et al. (1992) on Hispanic subgroup birth outcomes.

MEASURES

The primary dependent variable of
interest is prenatal care utilization. Although there have been numerous attempts to measure the adequacy of
prenatal care received by pregnant
women (Kessner et al., 1973), the measure we employ in the current analysis
is the “Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization Index” developed by Kotelchuck (1994). This index characterizes
prenatal care utilization on two related
dimensions—timing of initiation of
prenatal care and adequacy of received
services based on the gestation age of
the infant and the number of prenatal
visits received. The initial dimension
assesses timing of initiation of prenatal
care and assumes that the earlier care
begins, the better. The second dimension characterizes the adequacy of received visits from initiation through delivery. This dimension determines if
the woman received the appropriate
number of visits for the period she was
receiving prenatal care, i.e., a ratio of
expected to actual visits based on date
of entry into care. Using the two dimensions, we define adequacy of prenatal care utilization as (1) inadequate,
(2) intermediate, (3) adequate, and (4)

Intensive. According to Kotelchuck,

inadequate care is care begun after the

fourth month of pregnancy or fewer
than 50 per cent of the visits recommended by the American College
of Obstetrics and Gynecologists
(ACOG). Intermediate care is that
care in which 50 to 79 per cent of the
ACOG recommended visits have been
received, Adequate care must begin by
the fourth month of pregnancy and the
woman must have between 80 and 109
per cent of the ACOG recommended
prenatal care visits. Finally, intensive
care refers to a situation where the
woman enters care by the fourth
month and includes 110 per cent or
more of the expected number of visits.
A summary of the criteria for the prenatal care index is given as Table 1.

Kotelchuck’s index does not take
into account risk conditions of the
mother, and although this is a limitation, the ACOG guidelines for determining adequacy were made in 1985
for women without additional risks.
The result of using this standard is to
create a conservative index, i.e., an
index that understates what ACOG
would consider appropriate for a
woman with any type of elevated risk
profile, or that overclassifies women
into the intensive category. Although
not a perfect measure of prenatal care
adequacy, Kotelchuck’s index is the
best currently available.

natal care, as these variables are available in the Linked Birth/Infant Death
data file. In addition to Hispanic subgroup (defined as Mexican American,
Puerto Rican, Cuban American, and
Central/South American), other variables in the predictive models include
(1) race of the birth father (nonHispanic black, non-Hispanic white, or
Hispanic), (2) region of the country
(West, Midwest, South, or Northeast),
(3) education of the mother, (4) age,
and (5) marital status.

RESULTS

Table 2 provides the distributions by
Hispanic subgroup of the variables included in the models. As can be seen,
there are major differences among
subgroups. For example, the proportion of women who were born outside
the U.S. or Canada varies from over 90
per cent of those who were classified as
Central/South Americans, to just over
46 per cent of Puerto Ricans. Puerto
Rican women were more likely to be
under 18 and not married, while Cuban
Americans were least likely to fall
into either of these categories. Cuban
women had substantially higher levels
of education with over 44 per cent
reporting at least some post-highschool work. On the other hand, over
40 per cent of Mexican American
women reported fewer than ten years

were most likely to enter into prenatal

were least likely to do so. Children
born to Mexican American women

Overall, these basic descriptive data
demonstrate that Cuban women are

quite different from other subgroups
of Hispanic women on several of the
indicators and represent a category of

more like non-Hispanic white women

vantaged and Puerto Ricans are the
least advantaged on those factors generally assumed to be important predictors of birth outcomes (specifically,
younger age, single marital status, and
later entry into prenatal care),

APPLYING A PROBIT SELECTIVITY
MOoDEL

In order to compute Kotelchuck’s
measure of adequacy of care, we must
have information on both the timing of
entry into care as well as the number of
visits completed. Although the linked
birth/death data base described above
includes the required variables, a significant number of women do not have
all necessary data on their individual
records to compute the index. Specifically, a large number of women do not
have complete visit information on
their birth record, meaning that selectivity bias may be a problem in the
subsequent analysis. Selectivity bias is
present when women with complete
information on the number of visits
differ systematically from those who
have incomplete information. Such differences may be observable or unobservable. For example, in the context
of the present study, if women from
one Hispanic subgroup systematically
had less complete records than women
from the other subgroups, this could
lead us to underestimate the effects of
subgroup membership on level of care
received simply because of the process
whereby women completed information on the number of visits.

Because of the possibility of such biased selection into the sample, we employed a modified Heckman’s (1979)
correction for selectivity bias in our
analyses. This correction involved estimating a probit equation which

Prenatal Care 45

predicted whether the woman had
complete information on number of
visits. Subsequently, we statistically
corrected for the selectivity bias when
estimating the ordered probit model
for adequacy of prenatal care.

The data in Tables 3 and 4, showing
the results of the probit selectivity
model, indicate that there was systematic selection into the final sample.!
Specifically, women who lived in the
west and the northeast were more
likely to have incomplete visit information and thus were less likely to be included in the final analysis of prenatal
care utilization than women who lived
in the midwest. Conversely, women
who lived in the south were more likely
to have enough information to be included in the final sample than women
from other areas. The data in Table 3
also show that women who were pregnant by a white father were more likely
to have incomplete information on
visits than were other women. Finally,
women with higher levels of education
were more likely to have complete visit
information and be included in the final analysis than women with less than
ten years of education. This systematic
self selection bias is statistically adjusted in the subsequent analysis of
level of prenatal care received.

MODELING SUBGROUP DIFFERENCES

interesting, the primary focus of our
research was to test models designed to

explain subgroup differences in prenatal care. To do that, we begin with the
results of an ordered probit model that
predicts level of adequacy of prenatal
care received by each of the Hispanic
subgroups. The analytic methodology
is discussed fully in Zavoina and McKelvey (1975) and will not be elaborated here. However, because this
particular method of analysis may be
unfamiliar to some readers, we note
that the interpretation of the coefficients is relatively straightforward.
Specifically, for any combination of
the independent variables, the probit
equation allows us to predict the probability what the dependent variable is
in each of the four categories of prenatal care adequacy. It follows from

this that the individual coefficients can
be interpreted as measuring the
amount of change in the dependent
variable on its unobserved underlying
scale associated with a unit change in
the independent variable. However,
since we only observe imperfectly measured or rank-ordered categories of adequacy, the coefficients measure the
incremental change in the probability
of being in the next higher adequacy
category associated with a one-unit
change in the independent variable. If
the independent variables are categorical, as is the case with membership in
a given Hispanic subgroup or marital
status, the coefficient in the ordered
probit model measures the increment
in the probability of one being in the

next higher level of adequacy as a result of membership in one subgroup
compared to another, or one state of
matrimony compared to another (the
excluded category in the analysis).?

the level of adequacy of prenatal care
received differs for the four specific
Hispanic subgroups, we present a sequence of models, each of which adds
additional variables that are theoretically important in explaining level of
care. The first model formally addresses the finding observed in Table 2
that the level of adequacy of care is affected by subgroup membership. Each
of the additional models sequentially
adds additional variables to determine
if the subgroup differences observed in
the bivariate analysis (and the first
model) are maintained. The variables
added to the initial model (and reflected in each of the more specified
models), include mother’s birthplace,
age, education, marital status, race/
ethnicity of the birth father, pally, and
region of the country.

Cuban women have the best birth
outcomes and are more advantaged
economically. Because of this, we will
use them as the comparison group.
Given this reference point, the coeffi
?The ordered probit model formulation employed in LIMDEP is that developed by Zavoina
and McElvey (1975). The model is specified as:
Z=Prt+e,e~N (0, 1), Y=0 if Z=p, 1 if
Up < Zsp,,2ifu,< Zspw,...jifZ > wy,
where the observed counterpart of Z is Y (the observed level of prenatal care), and is a vector of
free parameters to be estimated. Estimates are obtained by maximum likelihood, and the probabilities which enter the likelihood function are: Prob
(y = J) = Prob (z; is in the j” range) of the ordered
category established by the values of .. The ordered
probit model with sample selection adds the selection mechanism: W;* = a'Xj. + u, u;~ N (0, 1),
W, = lifW* > 0 and 0 otherwise, i.e., the univariate probit model, and, most importantly, Y is observed if and only if W, = 1.

Prenatal Care 47

cients in Model 1 in Table 5 show that
Cuban women are significantly more
likely to have higher levels of prenatal
care than any of the other three Hispanic subgroups. Indeed, the magnitude of the coefficients for Central/
South American women (-0.24),
Mexican women (—0.29), and Puerto
Rican women (—0.28) indicate that
compared to Cuban women, the probability of receiving higher levels of
prenatal care decreases at roughly
comparable levels for ‘women of all
other subgroups.

As a companion analysis to the probit model result in Table 5, Table 6 presents classification results indicating
the degree to which knowledge of position on the relevant independent
variable (i.e., subgroup membership)
allows correct prediction into individual care levels. By examining the classification results for Model 1 in Table
6, we note that knowledge of Hispanic
subgroup membership does not correctly place any women into the intermediate or intensive levels of prenatal
care. However, simply knowing the
subgroup membership allows for correct classification of approximately
90 per cent of the women receiving
inadequate prenatal care. Conversely,
knowledge of subgroup membership
allows correct classification of only 20
per cent of those receiving adequate
care,

The results of Model 1 indicate that,
when other important characteristics
of the woman are not formally considered, there are significant subgroup
differences in levels of prenatal care
received by Hispanic women, as was
reflected in the bivariate results. The
remainder of the analysis focuses on
the question of what happens to these

subgroup differences when other factors are controlled.

Whether or not the birth mother
was born outside the United States has
been shown to impact the level of prenatal care received. Mother’s origin
was also shown in Table 2 to be related
to Hispanic subgroup membership.
Hence, there is an expectation that
controlling for this factor may change,
or even eliminate, some of the observed subgroup differences. The results of Model 2 address this issue. As
expected, if the birth mother was born
outside the United States, the probability of receiving higher levels of prenatal care decreases by —0.17. However, controlling for this factor does
little to the originally observed relationship between subgroup membership and level of prenatal care received. Compared to Cuban women,
each of the other subgroups still have
deceased probabilities of higher levels
of care ranging from —0.24 for Puerto
Rican women to —0.28 for women of
Central or South American descent.

Model 3 presents results when both
birth place and age of mother are included in the analysis. As anticipated,
older women have slightly increased
probabilities of receiving higher levels
of prenatal care. Further, when controlling for age, the net effect of mother’s place of birth increases from —0.17
in Model 2 to —0.22 in Model 3.

As was true in both Models 1 and 2,
there are important subgroup differences with Cuban women having significantly higher probabilities of receiving higher levels of prenatal care
than any other group. However, controlling for age and birth place of the
mother changes the original relationship. For Puerto Rican women, the

Social Biology

probability of receiving higher levels of
care is —0.20 lower than for Cuban
women. However, if the woman is of
Central/South American descent, the
decreased probability is —0.33. This
figure indicates that a Cuban woman is
over one-third more likely to receive
higher levels of prenatal care than
Central/South American women. An
examination of the classification results
presented in Table 6 for the third
model demonstrates an _ interesting
point. Knowledge of age increases the
correct classification of women who re
ceive adequate prenatal care from 20

per cent (Models I and 2) to 32 per cent
(Model 3). Knowledge of age also results in the classification of 3,287
women into the intensive prenatal care
category although only 822 of the
women are correctly classified in this
level.

The data in Table 2 showed a relationship between level of education
and subgroup membership of the
women. Further, research has consistently shown a relationship between
level of education and level of prenatal
care received. The results of adding education to the model are presented in
column four of Table 5. Consistent
with other literature, higher levels of
education are associated with increased probabilities of receiving
higher levels of prenatal care. Of particular interest in the current study is
what happens to the impact of subgroup membership when education is
controlled. An examination of the coefficients shows that with education
controlled, the disadvantage of Mexican women relative to Cuban women is
decreased by over one-half. Central/
South American women remain the
most disadvantaged (b = —0.29), and

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

Vol. 43, No. 1-2

Puerto Rican women show additional
convergence with Cuban women
(b = —0.18).

By examining the coefficients for
Model 5, we see that the convergence
of the probabilities for Cuban women
and Puerto Rican women continues to
increase with the addition of marital
status to the model. Now Puerto Rican
women have a probability of receiving
increased levels of prenatal care that
is only —0.09 below Cuban women.
The relative disadvantage of Central/
South American and Mexican women
changes only marginally as a result of
adding education to the model.

Although there is some modest
change in the level of prenatal care received by the four Hispanic subgroups
associated with the inclusion of race of
the birth father (Model 6) and parity
(Model 7), the major change occurs
when the model is fully specified to
include region of residence (Model
8). By examining the coefficients for
Model 8, it can be seen that once all
other factors have been statistically controlled, women of Puerto Rican origin
do not differ significantly from Cuban
women in the level of prenatal care received. Conversely, the probability of
receiving a higher level of prenatal
care adequacy is significantly less for
both Mexican women and Central/
South American women than for Cuban women. Indeed, an examination of
the coefficients indicates that Central/
South American women have the lowest predicted level of prenatal care
adequacy of any Hispanic subgroup
(6 = —0.21), followed by Mexican
women (b = —0Q.15).

A final point on the ability of the
model to correctly classify the women
into level of prenatal care received is

 

Prenatal Care 51

noteworthy. The addition of education
(Table 6, Model 4) increased the correct classification of women receiving
adequate care to 32 per cent, and also
resulted in the correct classification of
735 (4 per cent) women receiving intensive prenatal care. By adding marital status, the correct classification of
women receiving adequate care increased to 39 per cent. The addition of
parity and region did little to alter the
overall correct classification of women
although it did increase the per cent of
women correctly classified as receiving
intensive prenatal care. |

The coefficients for Model 8 summarize the findings from the most specified equation. Although not a central
focus of the current analysis, the data
in the last column of Table 5 are also
informative in helping understand the
differences in the level of prenatal care
received by Hispanic women generally. Specifically, the results suggest
that once other factors have been statistically controlled, being married and
having more than twelve years of education are the strongest predictors of
increased levels of prenatal care adequacy. The probability of receiving the
next higher level of care increases by
0.27 for married women versus unmarried women, and by 0.28 for women
with more than twelve years of education versus women with less than ten
years of education. Similarly, the probability of receiving more adequate
levels of care increases with the age
of the woman (b = 0.03), as well as for
women whose child was fathered by
either a white (b = 0.14) or black (b =
0.10) male instead of a Hispanic male.

While being married and being
older improve the probability of receiving higher levels of prenatal care, if

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

52 Albrecht and Miller

the woman was born outside of the
U.S. (e.g., in Puerto Rico, Mexico, or
Cuba), the probability of receiving
higher levels of prenatal care is significantly lower (6 = —0.25) than for
women who were born in the U.S. Similarly, the probability of receiving more
intensive prenatal care decreases as the
level of parity increases (b = —0.18).
This finding is consistent with the idea
that as the experience of pregnancy
and childbirth becomes more familiar,
the perceived need for prenatal care is
reduced. However, this result is also
consistent with a finding that access (as
determined by financial indicators)
may be more restricted for women with
larger families.

The findings also demonstrate an
impact of region of the country on the
receipt of level of prenatal care received. Specifically, if a woman lives in
the northeast, she is predicted to receive the lowest level of care followed
by women in the south and the west,
respectively. Women living in the midwest (the excluded category) have significantly higher probabilities of higher
levels of prenatal care than any other
region.

BINOMIAL LoGIT MODEL

The findings just presented identified those characteristics of the woman
that lead to differential use of prenatal
care. However, the classification matrix at the bottom of Table 4 indicates
that the model fits modestly with only
42 per cent of the cases classified correctly. Further, the distribution of the
cases in the classification matrix point
out that the model was completely
unsuccessful in correctly predicting
women into the “intermediate” category, and only correctly predicted 5

Social Biology

per cent into the intensive category.
Conversely, the model was relatively
successful in predicting women who received either inadequate care (85 per
cent correctly classified) and moderately successful in predicting women
who receive adequate care (48 per
cent). Consequently, we were interested in verifying the maternal characteristics that differentiated women who
received less than adequate care from
those who received care that was adequate or more. To accomplish this result, we estimated the binomial logit
mode] presented in Tables 7 and 8. The
results from the logit model are summarized below.

Consistent with the results from the
ordered probit model, Central/South
American women and Mexican women
were significantly less likely to receive

higher levels of care than their Cuban

counterparts. The results from the logit
model again place women from these
two subgroups in a position of relative
disadvantage compared to Cuban
women. The measured odds of receiving adequate or intensive care are approximately 29 per cent lower for
Central/South American women, and
21 per cent lower for Mexican women
than for Cuban women. The results
from the logit analysis further suggest
that women who are married (b =
0.45), women who have more than
twelve years of education (b = 0.61)
and women who are older (b = 0.45)
are more likely to receive care that is
deemed at least adequate. The odds of
receiving adequate care is 1.57 times
higher for married women than for
women who are not married, and
women with more than twelve years of
education are almost twice as likely
(OR = 1.84) to receive adequate care

than women with less than ten years
of education. Conversely, Hispanic
women who were born in their country
of origin were 36 per cent less likely
(b = —0.44) to receive adequate care
than their counterparts who were born
in the United States. Further, and once
again consistent with the results from
the earlier ordered probit analysis,
women are less likely to receive adequate care if they are giving birth to
their second or later child.

DISCUSSION

Our findings confirm previous analyses that suggest that there will be significant differences among Hispanic
subgroups on indicators of health and
health care utilization. Overall, Cuban
Americans are relatively advantaged
when compared to the other groups.
The differences among subgroups in
prenatal care utilization are at least as
large as those that typically distinguish
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

54 Albrecht and Miller

between Hispanic and non-Hispanic
groups in the United States. In a companion analysis (Albrecht et al., 1994)
we have determined that in terms of
birth outcomes, Puerto Ricans have
rates of adverse outcomes that are
typical of the black population in this
country, while the Cubans do better
than non-Hispanic whites. Our bivariate results are generally consistent with
previous research in suggesting that
Cubans are the most advantaged and
Puerto Ricans least advantaged in our
measures of adequacy of prenatal care.
The multivariate analysis reveals that
these differences are systematically reduced as other variables are entered
into the model, but it is only when we
get to the most fully specified model
that the Cuban/Puerto Rican differences become statistically nonsignificant. Of all the variables that play a
part in reducing the magnitude of the
differences between these groups,
marital status has the greatest impact
on the size of the coefficients. It appears that the greater propensity for
Puerto Rican women not to be married
at the time they give birth is what most
distinguishes them from Cuban women
when it comes to explaining differences
in prenatal care.

None of the controls that are entered into the multivariate models reduce to the point of nonsignificance
the differences in adequacy of prenatal
care between Cuban women and those
whose ethnic origins are in Mexico
or Central/South America. However,
some of the controls do substantially

reduce the size of the coefficients, as is 
the case when education level is added
for Mexican women. While the Puerto
Rican differences are reduced by the
combination of the several variables

 

Social Biology

that are controlled in the models, this
reduction does not happen for the
other two groups. Our final results
indicate that in terms of prenatal care
adequacy, Puerto Ricans are more
similar to Cubans when other factors
are entered into the model, and both

' have higher levels of care than women

of either Mexican or Central/South
American origin. Taken together,
these findings reaffirm the contention
that Hispanic groups must be considered individually in health-related
research and policy development.
Grouping them into a single analytical
category has the potential to mask too
many important subgroup differences.

In addition to Hispanic subgroup,
other variables in our analyses that
were important in understanding prenatal care adequacy include marital
status, education, birthplace, and region of residence: Married women obtain better care than single women; the
higher educated score higher on the
utilization index than those with less
education; women born in the U.S.
have better access to prenatal care than
those born outside the U.S.; and those
who live in the midwest obtain better
care than women living in other areas
of the country.

We conclude with some observations designed to bridge our present effort with future research that is sorely
needed to move our state of knowledge
forward. While we have noted that
there are important differences among
Hispanic subgroups in terms of utilization of prenatal care, the fact.remains
that whatever the level of care received, Hispanic birth outcomes (as
measured by rates of low weight births
and infant mortality) tend to be comparatively good. This finding does not
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

Vol. 43, No. 1~2

deny subgroup differences that result
in Cuban American rates being generally more: favorable than rates for
non-Hispanic whites, at one end, and
Puerto Rican rates more _ nearly
comparable with non-Hispanic blacks,
at the other. Nevertheless, even when
controlling for their comparatively
higher risk profiles, Hispanics do comparatively well on infant-related health
measures.

What this means ts that while significant attention has been given in recent
years to increasing the quality of prenatal care as one way of increasing
rates of positive birth outcomes, that
link may not be as strong as has been
assumed. Recent findings note, for
example, that the substantial increase
in the proportion of U.S. women who
initiate care in the first trimester in the
past two decades has not been accompanied by a-significant decline in lowbirthweight infants (Mustard and
Roos, 1994). Clearly, this finding has
important theoretical, empirical, and
practical significance. The logic of
many health-related reforms has been
clear. If we increase access to prenatal
care among disadvantaged popula
‘tions, we will decrease the occurrence

of low birthweight infants and infant
mortality. Yet, if evidence for a beneficial effect of early and frequent prenatal care on birthweight remains ambiguous, then this finding calls into
question a very important assumption.

Data indicating inconsistencies between risk profiles (as measured by entry into prenatal care) and outcomes
for Hispanic Americans is supported
by recent work on Asian Americans
(Morrow et al., 1994; Singh and Yu,
1994). Compared to Anglos, Asian
Americans have a lower proportion of

Prenatal Care 55

women who receive prenatal care in
the first trimester of pregnancy and a
higher proportion of women who receive no prenatal care at all; yet, like
Hispanic women, they demonstrate
lower rates of negative birth outcomes
than their risk profiles would predict.
What is increasingly clear from this
is that much of the variance remains
unexplained by current models. While
our data have not allowed us to address
these issues directly, we. can briefly
note some suggestions for future research that, we believe, clearly follow
from the available literature.

One line of reasoning, with particular reference to Hispanics is that because Hispanics, and particularly first
generation immigrants, choose a more
healthy lifestyle, the absence of prenatal care as reflected in the timing and
number of visits to a formal care provider may be less important. Much of
what is emphasized during prenatal visits reflects on dietary patterns, rest,
etc., all of which may more closely
characterize a culturally defined lifestyle. Further, family relationships
may be critical in translating cultural
patterns into actual practice. Close
family relationships may contribute to
better prenatal care even when this
does not occur through the formal
health care system. As reported earlier
by St. Clair et al. (1989), underutilizers
are more embedded in networks of
family and kin and this, in turn, can
lead to decreased reliance on the services of professional providers.

Unmeasured family and cultural
factors may be particularly important
in the Hispanic context. Among Hispanics generally, the concept of “‘family” refers to more than just the nuclear
family. It incorporates the idea of la

familia, or the greater family, which includes relatives that are traced on both
male and female sides (Alvarez, 1993).
Because of the importance of this
greater family, Hispanics are more
likely than non-Hispanic whites to live
in extended family relationships and
these extended kin generally assume
greater responsibility for family wellbeing and quality of life.

If these arguments are correct, it
may mean that there exists a greater
family-driven tendency to encourage
positive and to avoid negative health
behaviors on the part of Hispanics, as
compared with other groups, and this
tendency may contribute to more favorable health outcomes. This situation may help account for the finding
that as Hispanics become more acculturated, their health status actually
worsens (Scribner and Dwyer, 1989).
Acculturation may involve moving
away from cultural and family patterns
that have been protective of more
healthy lifestyles, even in the context
of less access to the formal health care
system. In the specific case of prenatal
care utilization, late or less frequent

Social Biology

contact with the formal care network
may be much less of a liability in those
instances where some of the more basic
health-related needs are being met because of familial and cultural expectations and lifestyles. We emphasize that
this link between family and cultural
factors and birth outcomes is largely
speculative. Research designed to address these specific relationships is
clearly needed.

In conclusion, we believe that the
relative ineffectiveness of current
models in predicting birth outcomes
remains an issue for at least two important reasons. First, the relationship
between SES and race/ethnicity and
morbidity and mortality in numerous
other health-outcomes settings is
clearly established. Why is it less important in research on birth outcomes?
Second, the possibility that factors not
included in current models that are
protective against risk in some cultural
settings may be generalizable to others
deserves further exploration. Clearly,
both issues require continued research
attention.
