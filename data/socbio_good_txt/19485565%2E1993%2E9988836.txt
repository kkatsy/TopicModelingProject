average female has a larger number of offspring per individual than the average male, and that
highly fertile males outnumber highly fertile females so that the total number of offspring
produced by males and females is balanced. Results indicate that a few males are responsible for

uous sexual receptivity, and synchronization of menstrual cycles, and other
factors, make it difficult for males to
control large harems (Daniels, 1979;
Burley, 1979). These facts suggest that
the optimal reproductive strategy for
each sex should be different among humans (Daly and Wilson, 1983; Grammer, 1989; Buss, 1989).

The existence of different combinations of optimal reproductive strategies
implies that fertility will be distributed
differently among individuals of each
sex in a given population. Unfortunately, fertility data for human populations, obtained through population
census, is available only for females,
and the few published data available
on male fertility (for example, Howell,
1979; Chagnon, 1980; Daly and Wilson, 1983; Brown, 1988; Hewlett,
1988) stem from studies conducted
on population isolates and minorities
which do not permit the plotting of detailed, statistically meaningful, fertility
distribution curves. However, all these
studies showed a greater variance for
male fertility compared to that for females, although detailed analysis of
the source of this greater variability is
missing. On the other hand, data on female fertility distributions from Bangladesh (Bongaarts and Potter, 1983)
and from U.S. censuses (David and
Sanderson, 1987) showed clear discontinuous distributions of fertility characteristics between the populations, indicating complex reproductive patterns
in human populations.

We had the opportunity to participate in a survey based on large regional
populations and to obtain data on fertility for both males and females,
thanks to the inclusion of questions on
fertility in the political polls for the

Social Biology

Venezuelan presidential elections of
1988. We studied the Venezuelan voting population (aged 18 years and
over) and estimated direct individual
fitness, using the total number of offspring (TO) ever born for each individual and the number of living offspring
(LO) at the moment of the data collection. We also studied fertility among
the Yanomami, a relatively unacculturated tribe which inhabit the upper
Orinoco River in Venezuela. Yanomami are swidden horticulturists who
supplement their diet with hunting and
gathering (Lizot, 1988). These data allowed a comparative analysis of the
variance in fertility, between males and
females.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data from all Yanomami present in
the community were collected through
informants and direct conversation by
anthropologist Gabriele Herzog in
1988 at Seroana, Tayariteri, Mahehototeri, Nahetipe, and Tortitha, all of
which are located in the Territorio
Federal Amazonas. Only information
about living children could be obtained
as Yanomami will not speak about
their dead. Age of subjects was not
possible to obtain as Yanomami do not
keep track of their age in number of
years. In addition, it was not possible
for us to estimate the end of the reproductive life of subjects. Thus, all
subjects who were recognized by
Yanomami as “‘marriageable”’ were included. Results of the 227 individuals
represent the total population at that
time in the five communities sampled,
which in turn have cultural characteristics unique to these communities and
different from those of other YanoVol. 40, No. 1-2

mami. Thus, statistical analysis of
these data is meaningless.

Data from 6,500 subjects over 17
years of age (including 1,098 females
over 40 and 985 males over 45 years),
in 15 urban areas, as representative of
the total voting population of Venezuela, were collected through the stratified (by geographical area, economic
status, age, and sex, based on the 1981

“national census) polls prepared by
&Simeven, measuring voting intenStions for Carlos Andres Perez and by
EMevenca for other clients, as part of
the presidential campaign of 1988 in
ooVenezuela. (The representativeness of
<-the sample was shown a posteriori to be
~accurate, with Simeven predicting the
"main results with an accuracy of 99
“per cent). The following questions
Swere given to the subjects (female or
Smale) to answer confidentially and in‘Sdividually: 1. How many living chil‘sdren (legitimate or not) do you have?
£2. How many children did you bear
‘during your life? 3. Age of children?
. Sex and age of informant? All interviews were conducted confidentially,
2n Spanish, by trained local staff.
3 Although data collection through
‘questionnaires could seem to be a duious method for estimating male fertility, this study shows that data provided by males is as reliable as that
provided by females, which is the standard procedure for collecting fertility
data in human populations, since both
samples reported statistically the same
total number of children (see results).

Few reliable methods for statistical
analysis of mixed samples exist, and
among those, the most simple and reliable method available is the Bhattacharya plot (Everitt and Hand, 1981;
Bhattacharya, 1967), which detects

discontinuities on a normal frequency
distribution through changes in the
slope of the distribution curve. Thus,
we chose this method to analyze our
data.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The fertility distribution among the
total adult population sampled, for the
Yanomami as well as for the rest of the
population studied, showed a different
distribution of fertility characteristics
for males and females. In Figure 1 we
present a snapshot of the total adult
population. Here, the number of adult
individuals is plotted according to the
number of living children they reported (LO). In both samples we find
more childless males compared to females, but females outnumbered males
in the low fertility categories. Males
having very many offspring outnumbered females.

This common pattern among totally
different cultures seems neither to be
an artifact of the sampling procedure
nor a particular characteristic of the
samples, as similar sex-differentiated
fertility distributions were found for
cultures which differ in many other
aspects. Among the adult Yanomami,
males outnumbered females by a ratio of 1.25. Within a sample of 13
Yanomami villages, Chagnon et al.
(1979) found a similar average sexratio of 1.29. In contrast, among the
polled population, females outnumbered males by a ratio of 1.05. Also,
higher child mortality among Yanomami, a general feature of societies
lacking modern medical facilities
(Campbell and Wood, 1990) explains
their comparatively lower fertility, as
measured by LO. In spite of these

dissimilarities, common patterns in the
sex-linked fertility distribution between both samples (i.e., both cultures) are evident.

Differential fitness for males and females could be estimated by eliminating subjects from the analysis who had
not completed their reproductive life
span (only for the polled population).
By comparing the age of the last child
with that of the informant, we calculated the probability of bearing a child
for subjects over 40 years, which was
0.27 for males and 0.07 for females.
Subjects aged over 45 years had a probability of child bearing of 0.08 for
males and 0.02 for females, and for
subjects over 50 years of age the prob
ability was 0 for females and 0.07 for
males. According to these data, we defined the end of the reproductive life
span at 45 years for males and 40 years
for females. We could thus estimate
TO and LO for any individual during
his or her reproductive life span with
an error smaller than 8 per cent. Although an analysis of age cohorts was
not possible with the data (and thus the
contribution of individuals who died
earlier, was not taken into account
here), the frequency distributions from
individuals above 35 or 55 years
showed qualitatively the same results
as reported here (not shown). Thus,
the distribution presented is a reliable

males. Integrating the total output of
offspring (LO) for each sex rendered
comparable numbers. That is, in our
sample, all the females produced a total of 4,661 offspring, whereas all the
males together reported 4,690 children
(a difference smaller than 0.62 per

cent). These results can only be explained if we assume that a relatively
small number of males (those with
more than 12 children) were responsible for the differential offspring production between the average female
and the average male. The equivalence
in the total number of offspring produced by each sex is even more striking, if we remember that more females
than males were present in the sample

Fic. 3.—Total number of living children (number of individuals) produced by females (continuous
lines) and by males (discontinuous lines) in each fertility category, who completed their reproductive
years (LO x Nr of individuals given in Fig. 2; X?7 = 450, p < 0.001, df = 20)

due to differential mortality among
sexes (see also Cowgill and Hutchinson, 1963; Teitelbaum, 1972) and that
the duration of the reproductive life
was different for each sex.

The form of the distribution curve is
similar for both sexes, although the
various modes do not overlap (Fig. 2);
but the variance in fertility differed significantly among the sexes. Variance
for LO of females was 10.92, whereas
that of males was 15.44 (p<0.001).
Clearly, males may have a higher maximum number of children than females.

The differences in the pattern of the
fertility distribution of each sex were
amplified in Fig. 3, where the proportional contribution of each fertility cat
egory to the total number of offsprings
produced is shown. Here the principal
modes which have the major impact on
population growth are clearly distinguishable, showing one for men with 5
children and one for females with 8
children. Again, children produced by
males with over 12 children were more
numerous than those produced by the
equivalent females.

Child mortality.—Data from the
polls also permitted estimation of the
effect of child mortality on the fertility
distribution curves. Although the measure of LO may be overestimated, it
indicates trends in child mortality if
compared to TO. Figure 4 gives the
fertility distribution for females and
males respectively, estimated through

TO and LO, and at the same time it
shows the percentage of children dying
at each fertility category. Clearly, the
effect on the fertility distribution of
child mortality is different for men and
women. Child mortality affects the fertility distribution of the female population much more than that of males
(Fig. 4). Women with more children
report more dead offspring than less
fertile women. That is, the frequency
distribution curve of LO for females is
closer to a Poisson distribution than
that of TO, partly due to the fact that
the death rate among children increased linearly with fertility. Females
seem to register TO more accurately
than do males, which could explain
the significantly (p <0.001, Students
t-test) higher child mortality declared
by females, more than twice that given
by males. This sex difference in the reporting of deaths validates the use of
LO instead of TO for inter-sex comparisons of fertility.

An important factor that might bias
our results could be the fact that males
do not know or do not recognize all
their children, i.e., they may report a
lower number of offspring. If so, our
results should show a smaller number
of total children produced by males
than that produced by females. To the
contrary, our sample showed that
males reported on the average a
slightly higher number of children than
females. The mean number of children
per female was 5.10, whereas that of
males was 5.41 children per individual.
This figure may be a close approximation of reality, as surviving males have
to compensate somehow for the comparatively greater mortality rate of
their sex. However, it may also reflect
the fact that males tend to overesti

Social Biology

mate their numbers of offspring. Independent evidence suggests that males
often recognize as their own (consciously or not) children who have a
different biological father (Wiener,
1943; Schacht and Gershowitz, 1963).
Contrary to this expectation, our results showed that the female fertility
distribution peaked at a higher fertility
category than that of males (Figs. 2 and
3), strongly suggesting that the average
female in the low-fertility categories
(fewer than 12 children) has more
mates (in time or space) than the average male, whereas the inverse occurs
in the high fertility categories (more
than 12 children).

Although fertility data do not characterize reproductive strategies directly, here they serve to estimate the
relative importance of the various reproductive strategies and to describe
the sex-dependent variance in reproductive success. The data are consistent with a population consisting of a
large proportion of polyandrous females (possibly sequentially and not simultaneously in time) and an average
monogamic male with some highly polygynous males. The polygamous reproductive systems found here do not
necessarily correlate with polygamous
marriage systems, although this could
be checked, for example, by correlating data on fertility with information
on divorce.

Mixed population samples.—None
of the fertility distributions presented
could be adjusted to a Poisson distribution (nor any normal distribution:
p <<0.001; SPSS’s goodness of fit
tests). Thus, an important point which
emerges from this study is that average
values do not accurately reflect the
structure of populations. There is more
Vol. 40, No. 1-2

than one modal point within a population. For a finer analysis of human societies, populations should be studied
as being made up of individuals who
use different noncompatible, but finite, strategies. Thus, techniques for
mixed samples analysis (Bhattacharya,
1967; Everitt and Hand, 1981) are useful for human population studies.

— constitute at least four distinct subpopulations which on average have 2.5,
® 4.5, 8.5, or over 12 living children (Ta= ble 1). That is, the fertility of female
'E subpopulations does not match that of
8 males, although the total production of
children is balanced. For the two subpopulations with low fertility, females
have more children than males, but for
the subpopulations with high fertility,
males have more children than females. Thus, none of the subpopulations are mainly monogamous. For low
fertility, polyandry seems to prevail; at
high fertility, polygamous males are
more common.
More individuals were found in the
two low-fertility categories (see Fig. 2),

indicating that most females are more
fertile than males and a few males
compensate for this fertility differential. Although no appropriate data on
male fertility are available for other
populations, data exist on female fertility. Fertility data from Bangladesh
females (Bongaarts and Potter, 1983,
Figure 6), if analyzed with a Bhattacharya plot, also show distinct subpopulations, where two subpopulations
(those with a mean of 4 and 13 children) resemble those of the Venezuelan population with a mean of 3.8 and
12 children (Table 1).

Sexual selection through female
choice. —Independent support to our
findings (i.e., the existence of a high
proportion of polyandrous females in
human populations) comes from studies on sexual selection of animal genitalia (Eberhard, 1985). Morphological
evidence indicates that sexual selection
of genitalia through female choice is at
work in most animal species, including
primates. That is, Eberhard found that
male genitalia are subjected to stronger selection pressures than female
genitalia, thanks to female choice. Sexual selection of genitalia through female choice will occur (Eberhard,
1985) when (1) females normally mate
with more than one male, and (2) a single copulation does not always result in
fertilization of the female’s entire complement of eggs. The latter is certainly
true for humans (Tietze, 1960), and the
former seems to be confirmed by our
study.

In addition, data from British females support the hypothesis that females promote sperm competition
(Bellis and Baker, 1990), adding to the
evidence that females tend to be polyandric.

CONCLUSION

Our results contradict the prevalent
assumption that humans are slightly
polygynic and rather suggest that a
more complex pattern exists, where interactions between polyandric females
with monogamic and polygynic males
are common.

The analysis shows that human
populations are a mixture of subpopulations with different fertility characteristics and that the fertility characteristics are not continuously distributed
among a given population. Individuals
seem to congregate at discrete fertility
“optima.” These optima could be
placed on a r-K gradient (Rushton,
1985) where each may represent a
specific adaptation, maximizing either
population growth or possibilities of
survival of a rather limited number
of offspring. The fact that this r-K gradient 1s not continuous, as had been
supposed by Rushton (1985), indicates
the existence of a complex pattern of
adaptive strategies in human populations which should be further investigated. Each blend of reproductive
strategies, together with the specific
fertility characteristics of the population, will produce a specific assemblage
of subpopulations based on fertility
characteristics which will in turn produce specific fertility frequency distributions, which can be characterized, as

done here. This method allows us to
compare populations with different
cultures, detecting the various statistical subpopulations, estimating their
relative proportions, and eventually
telling us about the factors which allow
these subpopulations to segregate statistically.

It would be of great interest to assess an eventual effect of increasing industrialization (and thus increased sophistication of larger populations) on
basic reproductive behavior at the population level. If the sex-related fertility
differences are at least partly biologically determined, similar proportions
of monogamic, polygynic, and polyandric individuals should exist in all
human populations. To confirm this,
we need to collect male fertility data
through nationwide surveys worldwide, which will help us to get a deeper
insight into our reproductive behavior.
With this knowledge we may eventually formulate more effective policies
for population control.
