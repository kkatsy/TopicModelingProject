Achievement and Social Mobility

Relationships among IQ Score,
Education, and Occupation
in Two Generations

Jerome H. Waller*

Dight Institute for Human Genetics
University of Minnesota
Minneapolis, Minnesota

Cyril Burt (1961) has set forth the following hypothesis with regard to social
mobility (or “social promotion’’):

... in a highly organized society, the dis
crepancies between the general intelligence

of the children and the occupational class
into which they are born is bound to produce a large and fairly constant amount of

“basic mobility,” quite apart from any de
liberate changes in the political or educa
tional structure of the society.

Several studies of the IQ test scores of
adult males in various occupational classes
have established that stratification of IQ
by social class exists and is also accompanied by considerable variation within each
class (Higgins, 1961; Bajema, 1968). When
IQ scores of the children of these adults
were examined in the Higgins (1961)
study, the phenomenon of filial regression
toward the mean was apparent within
each class. Since IQ test scores measure,
albeit imperfectly and in a general way, a
quantitative trait with a significant genetic
component (Erlenmeyer-Kimling and Jar
* Present address: Department of Bicstatistics,
Graduate School of Public Health, University of
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

 

vik, 1963), a large part of this observed
regression may consist of “biological regression” attributable to the segregation
and assortment of the genes influencing
the trait. If the distribution of IQ by occupational class has not changed substantially between generations (and there
is no evidence that it has), some occupational mobility of individuals must occur
prior to adulthood in order for the distribution of the filial generation to approach
that of the parental generation.

Burt (1961) presented rather similar
data from his British sample, and it was
with regard to that sample that the abovequoted hypothesis was framed. Rigorous
comparison of Burt’s (1961) data with
that of Higgins (1961) is not possible because Burt adjusted both the mean and
standard deviation of each generation in
the construction of his tables, and because
his actual sample size was not stated.

In a pilot study conducted by Young and
Gibson (1963), 47 males “in their twenties” resident in Cambridge, England were
interviewed and their fathers were traced.
The results of a comparison between

252

Vol. 18, No. 3

father’s and son’s IQ score showed the
same regression phenomenon, and also the
change of class status expected on the
Burt hypothesis. Perhaps more importantly, when distance of movement
was examined on a six-point class scale and
related to the amount of difference between the IQ scores of fathers and sons,
it was found that greater distance of movement was associated with greater difference
in test score. The results of Gibson’s recent study (1970) of 35 Cambridge scientists, their brothers, and their fathers,
substantiated this association.

Duncan (1968) proposed a path diagram
which represents the dependence of achieved
status upon family background and intelligence. This was an extension of an
earlier basic model of the process of social
stratification (Blau and Duncan, 1967, p.
170). It was Duncan’s contention that
before one can evaluate the mechanism of
“intelligence regression” described above,
one should deal with a multiple-variable
approach in which status itself is the dependent variable. Accordingly, he constructed a model utilizing information from
various sources, all of which pertained to
the United States male population of ages
25-34. The methodology employed was
that developed by Sewall Wright (1921)
which utilized systems of correlation coefficients interpreted causally on the basis
of criteria external to the numerical analysis itself.

Achieved status was scaled according to
Duncan’s (1961) socioeconomic index of
occupational status. When status was the
dependent variable and four “predetermined” variables (“early” intelligence,
number of siblings, father’s education, and
father’s occupation) were considered in
relation to that status, it was found that
intelligence contributed substantially to the
explained variance in the other three “entirely apart from the joint contribution

Achievement and Social Mobility

253

shared by all four variables” (Duncan,
1968, p. 10). Of the 42% of variance in
education accounted for by all four variables, 16%, or more than one-third, was
due to intelligence alone; of the 28% of
variance in occupational status explained
by the multiple regression, about 9%, or
nearly one-third, was attributed solely to
intelligence; and of the 11% of variance in
earnings due to multiple regression, 5%,
or almost half, was accounted for by intelligence.

Duncan’s (1968) summary stated the
substance of the relationship quite cogently:

If intelligence affects achievement, and if

intelligence is not perfectly predictable

from information on the status and circumstances of the family of origin, then intelligence will produce variation in achievement
that is unrelated to the status of that family.

The “meritocratic” principle has a guarantee

built into it that status will not be perfectly

transmitted between generations.

While it has been observed that there is
a considerable stratification of IQ by social
class, the presence of variability in IQ
within each class coupled with the independent contribution of IQ to the variance
in educational attainment, occupation, and
earnings mitigates against the fixity of the
individual’s class position and provides a
springboard for many persons to leave the
class of their origin and hence to be socially
mobile.

The objectives of the present study were
these: to test whether the Burt hypothesis
was supported by evidence from data pertaining to a sample of fathers and sons in
the United States, and to illustrate the
effect of intelligence (as measured by IQ
test score) upon achieved status of the
sons.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The sample of this study consists of 131
fathers and their 173 sons and was taken
from the much larger population studied
by E. W. and S. C. Reed (1965). The

254

present sample is representative of white
males in the state of Minnesota, insofar as
the only criteria for inclusion were that the
sons be 24 years of age or older and that
an IQ score be available for father and son.
The scores had been obtained when the
individuals were in school. Mean age at
testing in years for the fathers was 15.90
+ 0.52 s.e. and for the sons, 13.38 + 0.20
s.e. Group tests had been employed in the
majority of cases; these included versions
of the Otis and Kuhlmann tests. Occupation and education were reported by the
fathers in response to a mailed questionnaire that was patterned after the OCG
supplement (Occupational Changes in a
Generation) to the 1962 Current Population Survey of the U.S. Bureau of the
Census (see Blau and Duncan, 1968, Appendix B). In most cases educational attainment could be verified from school reports on file at the Dight Institute for
Human Genetics.

Although the original records were compiled from data on families directly related
to persons living in the state of Minnesota,
12 other states and one foreign country
were represented in the present addresses
of the 131 fathers in this sample. Among
the 173 sons, 119 were residing in Minnesota: of the remaining 54, 18 were in

military service, 1 was in a foreign country,
2 were unknown, and 33 were distributed
among states other than Minnesota at the
time of this study.

Educational attainment and occupational
level were coded using the Hollingshead
(1958) system. Since this scale calls for
size and/or value of farm for rating of occupational level of farmers, and since this
information was unavailable, no persons
listing this occupation could be included.

RESULTS

The distribution of IQ test scores is
shown in Table 1 for the 131 fathers and
their 173 sons. Comparison of the first two
columns of means, in which all subjects are
classified according to the social class
(SES) of the father, demonstrates the observed regression toward the population
mean for the scores of the sons. Comparison
of the first and third columns of this table
demonstrates the relative stability of the
distribution of IQ test score by social class
(SES) over the two generations.

The correlation matrix (Table 2) gives
the zero-order Pearsonian correlation coefficients among IQ test score, education, number of siblings, and occupational
level for 131 fathers and 170 sons (note

is not used). In addition, the correlation
between the IQ test score of 84 fathers and
their occupational level of origin was r=
-+- 0.026. In each case the occupational
level of origin was that of the male parent
at age 16 of the subject. Three institutionalized retarded sons were omitted from
this analysis; hence the total number of
sons is reduced.

Since an individual born into the highest
social class (Class I) can only remain
there or move down, and an individual
born into the lowest class (Class V) can
only remain there or move up, the sample
was restricted to the 146 father-son pairs
in which the father was of Class ITI, ITI, or
IV. The mean IQ scores for this sample
were 100.57 + 13.62 (s.e.= 1.27) for the
115 fathers, and 103.84 + 1438 (s.e.=
1.19) for their 146 sons.

The data of this study show a consistent
association between father-son difference
in IQ score and father-son difference in
social achievement, whether the latter difference is measured in terms of ISP score
or social class. The Hollingshead Index of

Social Position (ISP score) was calculated
for all fathers and sons. This index provides a rating from 11 (high) to 77 (low)
which can be treated as a continuous
variable. The correlation between fatherson difference in IQ score and father-son
difference in ISP score for the total sample
is r=-+ 0.291 + 0.080 S,. For the restricted sample that includes only the
fathers in Classes II, III, and IV with their
sons, r= -+ 0.368 + 0.066 S,. The exclusion of sons born into the extreme classes
thus slightly increases the value of the
correlation coefficient and at the same time
provides a more rigorous test of the Burt
hypothesis.

Table 3 shows the relationship between
father-son difference in IQ score and
change in social class of the sons for the
sample of 170 pairs. Table 4 is confined to
the sample of 146 pairs, and shows the
same relationship. These latter data are
represented graphically in Figure 1, in
which the cases of father-son difference
greater than 37.5 points are omitted. The

5 gives the results of these analyses.

DISCUSSION

The data of the present study support
the hypothesis that father-son differences
in social position are attributable in some
degree to father-son differences in ability
as measured by IQ test score. Since 10
tests were originally designed with the objective of predicting success in school (and

to a lesser degree, in society), it is not
surprising that the two measures of ability
(IQ score and occupational achievement)
are associated. As Burt (1961) pointed
out and as the data of this study show
(Table 1), there is a difference in the distribution of IQ scores by a subject’s social
class of origin vs. the subject’s own class.
The “basic mobility” required by the
hypothesis to restore the original occupational distribution of IQ scores is asso

ciated with differences in IQ score between
fathers and sons (Tables 3 and 4). Figure
1 demonstrates that the amount and direction of father-son difference in IQ score is
directly associated with movement from
the social class of origin. This is also reflected in the correlation between fatherson difference in IQ score and father-son
difference in social] position (7 = + 0.368
for the sample of 146 sons).

Upon examining the correlations among
IQ score, educational level, and occupational level (Table 2), there is a small
apparent difference between the two generations in the roles played by education
and IQ score as contributors to achieved
status. Whereas the correlation between
IQ score and occupational level for the
fathers is ++ 0.569, the value for the sons
is lower, at -+- 0.497. This difference is not
statistically significant at the 0.05 level,
but one may infer that the IQ score of the
fathers is somewhat more closely associated
with their achievement than is that of their
sons, when achievement is measured by
occupational level. A large part of this
difference is attributable to the difference
in age of the subjects when their occupation was rated. The mean age of the fathers
at the time of the study was 52 years, but
that of the sons was only 27 years. Hence
the fathers had opportunity for (intragenerational) mobility. If the sons are followed up some 25 years from now, the
correlation should even more closely resemble that of the fathers.

The relationship between education and
occupation for the two generations also
differs, but in the opposite direction. The
correlation between educational level and
occupational level is + 0.582 for the
fathers and + 0.724 for the sons (Table
2). Again, difference between generations
is not significant at the 0.05 level. In this
case, the inference that education is more
closely associated with the occupational

Waller

Social Biology

achievement of the sons is supported by
the knowledge of a change in the educational structure during this generation,
specifically the advent of compulsory
education laws. Given the higher correlation of IQ score with education for the
fathers (r= -+ 0.719) than for the sons
(7 = + 0.568) and the higher mean educational level of the sons (3.45 vs. 4.49), it
may be inferred that in the earlier generation the subjects with higher IQ scores
tended to stay in school longer than their
contemporaries. The first-order partial correlation between education and occupation
(“holding IQ constant”) is + 0.308 for
the fathers and -+- 0.628 for the sons. In
these data, then, there is evidence that the
amount of formal education is more closely
associated with the occupational level of
the sons than with that of the fathers.
The correlation between IQ score and
occupational level of origin for the two
generations is not significantly different:
for the sons, r= -+0.324 and for the
fathers r= -}-0.206. The probability of
obtaining these two values when sampling
from the same population is P= 0.58.
This rather low correlation is consistent
with the observed variability in mean IQ
score within social classes and the regression toward the population mean of the
sons born into each class (Table 1).
There are at least two points of interest
in interpreting the results in Table 5.
First, the two largest contributions to the
explained variance in both education and
occupational level are the IQ test score of
the son and the occupational level of the
father. Of the 44% of the variance in
education accounted for by all four variables, 11.8%, or over one-fourth, is due to
intelligence alone; and of the 37% of
variance in occupational level explained
by the multiple regression, 12.5%, or
about one-third, is attributable solely to
intelligence. The father’s occupational level

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:54 08 December 2015

Vol. 18, No. 3

contributes 10.8%, or over one-fourth, of
the total variance in education accounted
for in the multiple regression. It contributes 12.5%, or about one-third, of the
explained variance in occupational level of
the son.

Second, the large independent contribution of IQ test score supports the notion
that intelligence will produce variation in
achievement that is unrelated to the status
of the family of origin. Hence, status, as
measured here by occupational level, is not
perfectly transmitted between generations.

Thus the data of the present study illustrate quite well the process of achievement
as outlined in the model of Duncan
(1968).

SUMMARY

The present study of 173 males and their
131 fathers, representative of the nonfarm
white population of Minnesota, supports
the hypothesis that social mobility is correlated with the discrepancies between the
general intelligence of sons (as measured
by IQ test scores) and the social class into
which they were born. A multiple regression analysis performed on these data
illustrates the independent contribution of

Achievement and Social Mobility

259

intelligence to the variance in two achieved
Statuses, educational attainment and occupational level. The substantial correla- .
tion between father-son difference in IQ
score and father-son difference in social
position (7 = + 0.368), and the relationship between the magnitude (and direction) of IQ score difference and the
distance (and direction) of social mobility
both support the view that differences in
ability provide a “springboard” that enables individuals to be socially mobile and
that to some degree prevents social classes
in an open society from congealing into
castes.
