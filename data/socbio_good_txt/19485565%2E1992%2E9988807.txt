Female Education, Age, Parity, and
Reproduction Cessation in Ghana

ABSTRACT: Data from the 1988 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey is employed to determine the existence of a relationship between the amount of education a woman has and her intent
to cease childbearing. The findings are that with increasing levels of education, a female’s desire
to cease reproduction also increases. However, this relationship is obscured if parity is not

controlled.

In less developed countries, increasing female education is acknowledged
to be a major antecedent to fertility decline. However, in many of these countries, there has been evidence of considerable increases in levels of female
education without the expected fertility decreases. Ghana, one such country, has experienced a substantial advance in female education in the three
decades since independence with no
significant decrease in fertility. The
proportion of females who have ever
attended school increased from 21 per
cent in 1960 to 62 per cent in 1984. Yet,
the first comprehensive national fertility data, the 1979 Ghana Fertility Survey, estimated the total fertility rate
(TFR) of 15-44 year old women at 6.30
for the 1975-79 period; the 1988
Ghana Demographic and Health Survey places the TFR at 6.11 for the
1985~88 period (Ghana Demographic
and Health Survey, 1989).

The lack of any significant fertility
decline also continues to characterize
many other sub-Saharan African countries. Numerous linkages between female education and fertility have been

documented. Increasing female education has been shown to have diametrically opposing effects on fertility. More
emphasis has been placed—in terms of
documentation—on the suppressor effect of education on fertility. On the
other hand, there is evidence of an inducing effect of education on fertility,
for example, when increasing levels of
education reduce sterility and improve
health.

For high fertility countries, development and an incipient emergence from
poverty are critically dependent on the
lessening of high fertility. Any hope for
a reduction in fertility is in turn predicated on an increasing proportion of
women (or, more precisely, families)
who want no more children. The logic
underlying the existence of an inverse
relationship between levels of female
education and fertility (see, for example, Caldwell, 1980) also suggests that
more education for females should be
positively related to a desire to cease
childbearing. If a distinct association
exists between level of education and
reproductive cessation then the argument for promoting increased female

education persists, even in the face of a
lack of aggregate fertility decline.

Earlier researchers have suggested
that the early stages of fertility decline
are associated with changes in family
size ambitions (Knodel, 1977; Knodel
and van de Walle, 1979). BourgeoisPichat (1967) suggested that fertility
decline in nonindustrial countries 1s associated with a decrease in the number
of children women had from a six- to a
two-child norm. Others (e.g., Namboodiri, 1972) stress the notion of a sequential fertility decision-making process and the need for parity-specific
analytical consideration.

Analysts of the fertility of less developed countries (LDC’s) have begun
to concede that the lack of a fertility
response to the family planning push
by people in LDC’s is essentially a result of a desire to have large families.
Caldwell and Caldwell (1990) suggest
that fertility in these countries is a rational result of the social, economic,
and cultural conditions prevailing.
Westoff (1988) shows that, contrary to
previous beliefs of the existence of a
substantial KAP-gap, the unmet need
for contraception is rather small. The
implication is that fertility limitation
remains an uninteresting prospect for
these people. At the same time, Caldwell and Caldwell (1990) outline factors which will almost definitely lead to
a reduction of fertility. While the consensus seems to be that sub-Saharan
Africa has not experienced any fertility
decline, Oheneba-Sakyi (1989) indicates that there is evidence of very recent changes in fertility behavior in
Ghana.

One way to anticipate what the future holds in terms of a fertility decline
is to ask women what their future in

tentions regarding fertility are. As indicated earlier, female education is regarded as a concomitant of fertility
decline. This study investigates the relationship between female education
and the intention not to have an ensuing child. The premise here is that the
data will provide evidence of higher
levels of schooling inducing higher reproductive cessation intentions.

Further, by using a question that
evokes a parity-specific response, another contribution of this study is to
evaluate the parity-specific nature of
the education-fertility-intentions link.
If it can be ascertained that an unambiguous relationship exists between female education and the fertility intention, after controlling for parity, even
in the face of an unclear relationship
without parity-specific control, then a
stronger argument for promoting increases in female education exists.
Methodologically, such a_ finding
would also stress the necessity of parity
specificity in the analysis of fertility or
intentions.

Finally, this study endeavors to
show that contrary to presumptions
that fertility control is uninteresting to
people in sub-Saharan Africa, more
educated females do have more interest in ceasing reproduction than their
uneducated, or less educated, counterparts. Deriving from this information
then would be a policy prescription
that advocates a more vigorous promotion of female education.

EDUCATION AND FERTILITY:
AN AMBIGUOUS LINK?

The level of female education is
generally perceived to be inversely related to fertility. However, it is widely

acknowledged that increasing female
education in developing countries influences certain proximate determinants (e.g., health, and breastfeeding),
which may in turn act to raise fertility.
The inverse relationship usually found
is believed to be a result of a change in
perception of the costs and benefits of
childbearing; these operate through affected demand, supply, and regulation
costs of childbearing (Cochrane, 1979;
Caldwell, 1980; Blake and Del Pinal,
1982; Cochrane, 1983).

Increasing levels of female education have also been recognized to reduce overall fertility in traditionally resistant areas of high fertility. Fargues
(1989) argues that fertility in the Moslem world has fallen partly because of
the erosion of education inequalities
between sexes. Aside from demographic (through age at marriage) and
economic (cost versus benefits) influences, psychological factors stemming
from increased education help lower
fertility by projecting women into the
world outside their family circle. Retherford and Ogawa (1976) state that
increases in female education account
for a substantial fraction (about 25 per
cent) of the fertility drop in Korea between 1960 and 1970.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data used in the study came
from the Ghana Demographic and
Health Survey, a nationally representative sample survey of 4,488 women
aged 15-49 and a subsample of 943
husbands. The survey was carried out
between February and June, 1988. For
the purpose of the present study, the
analysis is restricted to the women
aged 20-49. Women under age 20 are

Social Biology

excluded in an attempt to ensure that
women in the analysis are at least past
the age of primary school completion
and are at least eligible, with respect to
age, to have some secondary education.

In addition to the age restriction, infecund women are dropped from the
study since their intentions are not relevant to the study. After these omissions, 2,490 women remain. These
women are presented in three educational categories: no education, some
primary education, and at least some
secondary education.

The dependent variable in the study
is dichotomous in nature; the definite
intention not to have another child is
coded one, while all other intentions or
plans for having more children (women
who want more, and those who are undecided or unsure) are coded zero. The
most restrictive definition of a negative
intent to continue childbearing is used
in order to derive a conservative assessment of the education/intentions
link. The question in the survey essentially asked women whether they
would like to have a/another child.
Possible responses were; have another,
no more, cannot get pregnant, and undecided or do not know.

RESULTS

A description of the women in the
Study is given in Table 1. The mean
number of years of schooling for
women with some primary schooling is
7.7 years, whereas it is 11.8 years for
women with at least some secondary
education. The uneducated women
have a mean age of 32.8 years and, as
expected, are slightly older than the
women with some primary education

want to cease childbearing to a slightly
greater extent (25 per cent). There
seems to be no relationship between
education and the cessation intention.
However, as alluded to earlier, the decision to have or not to have another
child is parity specific and dependent
on the number of children a woman already has, We expect women at higher
parities to be more prone to want to
cease childbearing.

Age and parity are widely recognized to impact on fertility intentions.
Older women and women at higher
parities are expected to have a lower
desire to continue childbearing. Table
3 presents the distribution of the intention to cease childbearing by age and
parity. Reading down the table, it is
clear that above parity three, women
increasingly want to terminate reproduction. Across the table, the relationship is not that vivid.

In Table 4 parity 1s introduced as a
third and control variable in the examination of the effect of women’s education on fertility intentions. A departure the current study makes from
typical parity-specific studies is in the
use of number of living children as opposed to children ever born. The assumption here is that the number of living children more - significantly
influences whether to have another
child than does the number of deceased children. Once parity is controlled, there is strong evidence of an
inverse relationship between education
and intentions.

No women with at least some secondary education exist at parity seven,
and no women with a primary education are at parity eleven. Whereas Table 2 showed no distinct relationship
between education and cessation inDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:44 08 December 2015

increases the log odds of the intention

women; having at least a secondary education raises the log odds to 1.49 relative to the uneducated.

DISCUSSION

It is important to recognize the necessity for parity-specific control in fertility analysis. Without controlling for
parity here, no relationship was observed between fertility and the cessation intention. However, once parity
was introduced a clear relationship
emerged.

The results of this study counter
claims that people in sub-Saharan Africa are not interested in fertility limitation. On the contrary, educated
women obviously are interested. A
problem may exist, though, in the ability to translate this intention into reality. This finding implies that there is an
urgent need for more research into
why, even though the intention exists,
there is no result in terms of decreased
fertility. Perhaps existing patriarchal

systems, kinship structures, and a general lack of female autonomy make
women unable to control their own fertility (Bourgeois-Pichat, 1967; Dyson
and Moore, 1983; Lerner, 1986),
thereby making their intentions ineffective. The challenge for policy makers then, is to understand how female
intentions can be made functional and
operative.
