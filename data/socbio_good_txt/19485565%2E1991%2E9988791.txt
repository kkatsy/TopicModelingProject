Fetal Loss and Contraceptive Acceptance

Among the Bhopal Gas Victims

Renu Kapoor

International Institute

Deonar, Bombay, India

 

ABSTRACT: The rates of fetal loss and family planning acceptance among Bhopal gas victims
from 1984 to 1989 were compared to those of a control group. In all, 136 eligible women in the
affected area and 139 women in the control area were interviewed. Care was taken to ensure that
these women had.conceived at least once during the previous five years. The fetal loss rate among
the gas-affected women was abnormally high (26.3 per cent) compared to that of women in the
control area (7.8 per cent). Family planning acceptance in both areas was similar, with most
women using permanent methods. In the case of temporary methods, the percentage of use was

higher in the gas-affected area.

On the night of December 3, 1984,
the Union Carbide plant situated at
Bhopal, India, released a highly poisonous gas, methyl isocyanate (MIC),
which spread over 40 sq. kms. and seriously affected people as distant as
5-8 kms. from the plant site (C.S.E.,
1986). It killed several thousand and
affected another 200,000 to 250,000
people in a few hours (Morehouse and
Subramanium, 1986).

The impact of any disaster, natural
or industrial, is felt more acutely by the
vulnerable members of the society,
among whom are the women and children. The Bhopal gas tragedy was no
exception. The studies and newspaper
reports published so far have viewed
the immediate impact of the Bhopal disaster on women and children who
were exposed to the gas leak. However, no study has been done to assess
the subsequent behavior of women exposed to MIC, including any changes
in fertility regulation practices that the
perceived after-effects of MIC might
have generated.

The present study was conducted in
1989, with the following objectives: (1)
to study spontaneous fetal losses, and
(2) to assess the knowledge and practice of different family planning methods after the Bhopal gas leak. In order
to obtain a clear picture about the impact of the gas leak on the fetal wastage
and family planning knowledge and
practice, the study was conducted in
two areas, namely the area affected by
the Bhopal gas tragedy and a control
area.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

SELECTION OF THE SAMPLE

In 1985, ICMR had identified different areas according to the degree of exposure to the gas leak, dividing them
into three categories: (1) severely affected; (2) mildly affected; and (3) not
affected, or control area.

In the severely affected area, Jaiprakash Nagar was randomly selected,
while a control area of similar socioeconomic status was selected from ar

eas identified as not affected. The selected areas were Annanagar, Ishwar
Nagar, Gautam Nagar, and Vikas Nagar. There were 136 eligible women in
the affected area and 139 women in the
control area who were selected purposively and interviewed. Care was taken
to ensure that all the eligible women in
the age group 20-44 had at least one
i, pregnancy during the previous five
S years. To make the two groups com+ parable, it was decided to take equal
‘= proportions from Hindus and Muslims.

In terms of social conditions, both
co the gas-affected and the control area
#3 were found to be quite similar. Social
's conditions were measured in terms of
= literacy, educational attainment, occu.2 pation, marital status, etc. A chi7 square test was calculated to test the
¢ difference between the two areas for
"g the above categories, and the differ© ence was not statistically significant.
Regarding economic status, a stanard of living index (SLI) was calcuated by taking into account household
possessions, such as drinking water facilities, toilet facilities, etc. The differ= ence in SLI between the two areas was
& statistically significant. This difference
is likely to be the result of compensation received by the _ gas-affected
households. Since the tragedy, many
facilities have been provided to the victims, like better drinking water facilities and the ‘“‘Sulabh complex”’ run by

be said that the change in standard of
living is a recent phenomenon.

RESULTS

FETAL Loss

In this study, fetal loss has been defined as loss up to 28 weeks of gestation. Pregnancies terminating after 28
weeks were taken as stillbirths. The
loss rate was computed per hundred
pregnancies. Pregnancy status at the
time of tragedy and in the intervening
period was recorded by asking appropriate questions of women age 20-44
in both areas. Thus, cohorts of women
were identified on the basis of conception following the gas leak. The firstyear cohort included women who had
conceived as early as April, 1984. Each
woman pregnant at the time of the
tragedy was followed for the outcome
of pregnancy, and the same was done
for subsequent years up to the time of
survey.

At the time of tragedy, there were
75 pregnant women in the affected
area compared to 60 in the control
area. The number of pregnancies reported was higher in the affected area
because just after the gas leak a great
deal of medical attention was directed
to the area, and all pregnancies diagnosed. Of 75 pregnancies at the time of
tragedy, 20 women (26.7 per cent) had
spontaneous fetal loss, while in the
control area the number was 6 (10.0
per cent) (Table 1).

“Rate of fetal loss refers to losses up to 28 weeks of gestation per 100 pregnancies.

Out of the 20 fetal deaths in the affected area, 16 were aborted in the
same month (December, 1984), while
the remaining 4 were aborted in subsequent months.

In subsequent years, out of the total
pregnancies in the affected area (255),
26.3 per 100 pregnancies terminated in
fetal losses, while in the control area
the figure was 7.8. This finding indicates that women in the affected area
were still experiencing fetal losses at
almost the same rate as immediately
after gas exposure. This could be due
to a persistent effect of MIC on the
reproductive capacity through deteriorating health of the women in the affected area due to repeated pregnancies and fetal deaths.

Several empirical studies have
shown that the rate of fetal loss varies
substantially with the age of the
mother (Bongaarts and Potter, 1983).
Therefore, in the present study an attempt was also made to see whether
the rate of spontaneous fetal loss varied with the age of mother. In the affected area, fetal deaths were higher
for all the age groups (Table 2), while
in the control area fetal deaths varied
with mother’s age, the normal pattern.
Fetal loss was high in the younger age
group 15-19, decreased in the 20-29
age group, and rose again in the 30+
age group.

MULTIPLE CLASSIFICATION ANALYSIS

The technique of multiple classification analysis has been widely used in
demographic research in recent years.
It is the same as multiple regression
analysis, using categorical variables as
predictors. It assumes an additive
model in which the predictors can be in
the interval scale or dummy variables.
The dependent variables have to be in
the interval scale or a binary scale. The
problem of multicollinearity among
the predictors is also circumvented in
this technique, but the findings are sensitive to the presence of interaction
among the variables. The input data
format and the interpretation of findings are quite simple and straightforward in this method of analysis.

Multiple classification analysis
(MCA) was carried out to determine
whether literacy, standard of living index, and area (exposed and control)
determine significantly the rate of fetal
losses, controlling for age.
Vol. 38, No. 3-4

The dependent variable was taken
as rate of spontaneous fetal deaths,
i.e., number of fetal deaths per number of pregnancies per woman. The
analysis was carried out by taking age
of the woman as the covariate and the
factors considered to influence fetal
loss (below 28 weeks) (predictors)
were: (1) literacy: (a) Illiterate, (b) Lit
erate; (2) area: (a) Gas exposed area,
3 (b) Control area; (3) standard of living
‘index: (a) Up to 12, (b) 12 and above.
© First, to test whether there was any
% interaction between the predictor variGables, I made an analysis of variance
using all two-way and three-way interactions (Table 3). Among the “main
coeffects,” only the area was highly siggnificant. Hence, the application of
‘gMCA was considered to be relevant in
-erthis case.

cies. Among women in the affected
area, the fetal loss rate was 24.32
(15.12 + 9.20), while for women in the
control area, it was 6.12 (15.12—9.00)
(Table 4). One implication of this finding is that in the affected area the fetal
loss rate was very high due to the leakage of MIC. The finding clearly indi
‘cates that the predictor of “area” hada

significant effect on fetal loss rate. The
other variables such as literacy, age,
and standard-of-living index did not
have any significant impact.

COMPARISON WITH ICMR FINDINGS

The rate observed in the present
study is similar to the ICMR finding of
24.2 as the rate of fetal loss in the affected area at the time of tragedy as
compared to 5.6 in the control area
(IJMR, 1990). In the present study, in
spite of the sample size being small as
compared to the ICMR sample size of
2,566 women in the affected area and

results are similar. The abortion rate
estimated in the present study was 26.7
in the affected area and 10.0 in the control area.

KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE
OF CONTRACEPTIVES

Contraceptive acceptance has been
linked with the study of fetal loss because it was felt that a high rate of fetal
loss and any perceived after-effects of
MIC might have resulted in fertility
regulation practices among the gas victims.

With regard to the awareness of
family planning methods, it was found
that the areas were almost similar, with
the largest number of women knowing
about terminal methods (vasectomy
and laparoscopy). Among the temporary methods, the condom was the
most widely known in both areas.

Ever USE

Women who had ever used any
method of contraception after the tragedy were considered as ever users. The
percentage of ever users was slightly
higher in the affected area (50.0 per
cent) compared to the control area
(48.9 per cent) (Table 5). However,
the percentage of acceptors of female
sterilization was 48.5 per cent in the affected area and 63.2 per cent in the
control area, showing that the use of a
terminal method was higher in the control area.

Preference for spacing methods
over sterilization can largely be attributed to the frequent visits of medical
teams to the affected area. These medical teams make regular visits to check
the health status of the gas victims.
Apart from providing health services,
the medical personnel also provide
counseling to the victims about the

CURRENT USE

Among current users of contraception, the percentage of acceptors of
terminal methods was very high in both
areas, 60 per cent in the affected area
and 83 per cent in the control area. The
percentage using spacing methods was

higher in the affected area (38.2 per
cent) compared to control area (17 per
cent) (Table 6). The percentage of
women reporting use of condoms was
29.1 per cent in the affected area and
13.2 per cent in the control area.

To test whether there was any difference between the current users of
sterilization and temporary methods in
the affected and control areas, a chisquare test was applied. It was significant at 0.02 level for 1 degree of freedom. It was encouraging to learn that
the percentage of ever users and current users was quite high in both areas
(50 per cent), in spite of both areas being of low socioeconomic status.

To examine the contribution of a
number of demographic and socioeconomic variables on the variation in current contraceptive use, further analysis
was carried out through the use of
MCA. Contrary to expectations, area
did not play any significant role. The
variable having significant impact on
current usage of contraception was
number of living sons.

CONCLUSION

The study indicated that fetal loss
was unusually high for gas-affected
people. This high fetal loss rate and its

- very slow decline in the affected area

indicates that the effect of MIC is still
persisting among the gas-affected population. Perhaps repeated pregnancies
and fetal losses have weakened women
in the affected area leading to continued high fetal losses. In the control
area, the fetal loss rate is comparatively low and is typical of any lower
socioeconomic urban community.

In the affected area, due to frequent
visits from medical personnel, the people have become quite accustomed to
the utilization of health services. This

 

Social Biology

utilization has increased child survival
in the affected area.

The finding that sterilization, particularly laparoscopy, is the most widely
accepted method in both areas shows
the need to give extra emphasis to advocating spacing methods. To some extent this has been realized in the affected area. Due to the frequent visits
of health personnel motivating people
to use spacing methods, acceptors of
temporary methods are increasing in
the affected area.
