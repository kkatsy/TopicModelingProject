ABSTRACT: The addition of personality measures to measures of family background and of cognitive ability substantially increased prediction of the educational attainment of middle-aged
males and females. The addition of personality measures to measures of family background,
cognitive ability, and own educational attainment substantially increased the prediction of the
occupational attainment of middle-aged males. Despite some differences, results generally

were similar across sexes and ethnic groups.

To the degree that a society permits
upward mobility individual differences
in cognitive abilities and personality
characteristics may be expected to affect
the socioeconomic status (SES) attained
by individuals. Herrnstein (1973) has argued that the United States is “‘meritocratic,” i.e., that individual differences
in intellectual ability that are, in part,
genetic in origin, play a significant role
in determining the occupational levels
that individuals attain. He has been criticized (e.g., Kamin, 1974) for having
taken this position. Despite basic ideological differences with Herrnstein,
Jencks and his associates (1972) acknowledge that individual differences in
ability have an influence upon SES,
though largely indirectly through educational attainment.

Jencks (1972) also suggested that personality characteristics, such as selfconfidence and self-control, account for
much of the variance in individuals’ occupational attainment that cannot be accounted for by their family background,

86

 

cognitive abilities, or education. More
recently, Jencks (1979) presented evidence in support of the influence of personality variables on occupational attainment. However, personality was
assessed through ratings, and the sample was quite young, so that there still
was room for substantial occupational
change—usually in an upward
direction—for the subjects of Jencks’
analysis.

The correlation of global IQ with occupational level has been found to be
approximately +0.50 (Herrnstein,
1973, p. 203; Jencks et al., 1972, p. 185
and Appendix B). It would seem reasonable that individual differences in
specific cognitive abilities may also influence occupational level. However,
the only data regarding the relationship
between specific cognitive abilities
(e.g., verbal ability, spatial ability) and
occupational status come from the research of Fozard and Nuttall (1971),
who examined the relations of General
Aptitude Test Battery scores to occupa

tional level. Among their findings was
that socioeconomic status (SES) was
more strongly related to general intelligence and verbal and numerical ability
than to spatial and perceptual ability
and dexterity. Aside from the Jencks
study noted above, there are few data
available with respect to the relationship
between personality characteristics and
occupational status. Turner and Martinez (1977) found that for men with

MATERIALS AND METHODS

As part of the Hawaii Family Study
of Cognition (HFSC) (see DeFries et
al., 1979; Wilson et al., 1975, for descriptions of the HFSC), 1,816 families

 

=above- average education a Machiavellian personality facilitated occupational

& If education is, in fact, the most im“portant mediating variable affecting oc2cupational attainment, then the predic
consisting of two biological parents and
one or more offspring over the age of 13
were tested on a battery of fifteen cognitive tests (see Wilson et al., 1975). These
tests loaded on four factors: Verbal
Ability, Spatial Ability, Perceptual
Speed and Accuracy, and Visual Memory (see DeFries et al., 1979). The unrotated first principal component correlated 0.73 with full-scale Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Test scores and may be regarded as a measure of general intelligence (Kuse, 1977). Respondents pro
‘Gion of an individual’s final educational
attainment is in itself an important area
dor study. For subjects still attending
‘school, studies (e.g., Cattell and
“Butcher, 1968; Barton et al., 1972; ManAdryk and Schuerger, 1974; Watterson et
al. 1976) indicate that information rearding an individual’s personality, as
easured by standardized tests, inreases the accuracy of prediction of academic achievement relative to that
from intelligence test scores alone.

The primary objective of the present
report is to assess the relations of scores
on standardized psychometric tests of
personality and cognition with the educational and occupational levels attained by a group of middle-aged male
and female subjects. Along with sex differences, possible ethnic differences in
the relative influence of background,
ability, and personality are examined by

vided information regarding their own
years of education and their occupation.
Occupational level was quantified using
Duncan’s National Opinion Research
Council (NORC) rating system (Reiss
et al., 1961). Studies (see Harasymiw et
al., 1977, for a review and new data)
have confirmed the reliability, stability
over time, and meaningfulness in American society of the concept of occupational status. Our respondents also provided information regarding the years of
education of their fathers and mothers
and, during later years of testing, provided information regarding paternal
occupation.

While the HFSC was conducted in
order to assess genetic and environmental influences on cognition, various subsets of subjects were administered personality measures as well. During the
summer of 1975, members of 188 fami

lies were administered a Series of supplemental measures of ability and information processing in addition to being
retested on the standard HFSC cognitive test battery. Family members also
were asked to complete the Eysenck
Personality Inventory (EPI) (Eysenck
and Eysenck, 1968) and the Comrey
Personality Scales (CPS) (Comrey,
1970). The EPI measures two major bipolar dimensions of personality: Introversion vs. Extraversion and Emotional
Stability vs. Neuroticism. A responsebias scale (Lie) is also available. The
CPS yields scores on eight bipolar personality dimensions: Trust vs. Defensiveness, Orderliness vs. Lack of Compulsion, Social Conformity vs.
Rebelliousness, Activity vs. Lack of Energy, Emotional Stability vs. Neuroticism, Extraversion vs. Introversion,
Empathy vs. Egocentrism, and Masculinity vs. Femininity.

Members of the same 118 families
were contacted in the spring of 1976 and
asked to participate in additional research. One hundred and five of the
families (393 individuals) agreed to participate and, among other measures,
were administered the Cattell Sixteen
Personality Factor Scales (16PF) (Cattell et al., 1970). Only the sixteen primary source trait scores were developed
for this sample. These include: Sizia vs.
Affectia (Reserved vs. Outgoing), Low
vs. High Intelligence, Low vs. High Ego
Strength (Emotional-Stable), Submissiveness vs. Dominance, Desurgency vs.
Surgency (Sober vs. Happy-go-lucky),
Weak vs. Strong Superego Strength
(Expedient vs. Conscientious), Threctia
vs. Parmia (Shy vs. Venturesome), Harria vs. Premsia (Tough vs. Tenderminded), Alaxia vs. Protention (Trusting vs. Suspicious), Praxernia vs. Autia
(Practical vs. Imaginative), Artlessness

vs. Shrewdness, Untroubled Adequacy
vs. Guilt Proneness (Placid vs. Apprehensive), Conservatism vs. Radicalism
of Temperament, Group Adherence vs.
Self Sufficiency, Low vs. High Strength
of Self Sentiment (Casual vs. Controlled), and Low vs. High Ergic Tension (Relaxed vs. Tense).

In addition to the EPI, CPS, and
16PF, the Adjective Check List (ACL)
(Gough and Heilbrun, 1965) was administered to each family member during regular test sessions for several
years. A majority of those persons (approximately 60 per cent) who took the
EPI, CPS, and 16PF also were part of
the sample administered the ACL. The
ACL is a three-hundred adjective
checklist originally scored by Gough
and Heilbrun to yield twenty-four scale
scores. Fifteen of the scale scores were
developed on a rational or theoretical
basis to measure the needs outlined by
Murray (1938), five other scales were
developed empirically on the basis of
relevant criteria, while the remaining
scales are primarily indices of testtaking behavior. Because of criticisms
with regard to the lack of independence
and psychometric properties of these
scales (Masterson, 1974), it was decided
to rescore the three-hundred items of
the ACL, using the results of an item
factor analysis by Parker and Veldman
(1969).

Parker and Veldman’s analyses
yielded seven factors. Alpha reliability
coefficients calculated on the 3,411
HFSC individuals who took the ACL,
the number of adjectives loading on the
factor, and some representative adjectives are given in parentheses after the
seven factors: Social Desirability (0.90;
28 items; pleasant, kind, warm); Interpersonal Abrasiveness (0.65; 9 items;
rude, lazy, foolish); Ego Organization

 
Vol. 30, No. 1

(0.87; 20 items; industrious, thorough,
efficient); Introversion-Extraversion
(0.66; 8 items; quiet, silent versus talkative, outgoing); Internal Discomfort
(0.79; 14 items; emotional, nervous,
worrying); Interception (0.71; 9 items;
reflective, unconventional, idealistic);
and Social Attractiveness (0.76; 10
items; polished, clever, charming).

The seven new scale scores were empirically corrected for the total number
-6f adjectives checked by obtaining the
linear and quadratic regression coefcients of each raw scale score on the
Humber of adjectives checked for the
Entire sample and computing the residgals for each scale. Since all seven of the
scales were significantly correlated with
‘age, even after the correction for numBer of adjectives checked, the scale
"scores were age-corrected by removing,
ja regression, the linear and quadratic
‘Gomponents due to age. All scales scores
‘Were then converted to standard scores.
‘6 In our presentation, we shall refer to
Subjects who took the ACL as our larger
sample and our subjects who took the
-EIP, CPS, and 16PF as our subsample.
‘The majority of the subjects were
‘Americans of European Ancestry

ponent, own years of education, and
ACL scores were available for 357 AEA
males, 144 AJA males, 326 AEA females, and 168 AJA females who were
members of the HFSC parent generation. Of these individuals, 340 AEA
males, 140 AJA males, 118 AEA females, and 127 AJA females were employed outside of the home and had provided data regarding all of the various
measures described below. Members of
other ethnic groups took part in the
HFSC; however, their comparatively
small numbers led to their exclusion
from the present analysis. Parental education and paternal occupation, age,
years of education, and NORC scores of
male and of female subjects of Caucasian and of Japanese ancestry are presented in Table 1 separately for all subjects and for only those subjects
employed outside of the home for whom
all information presented in Table 1 was
available.

The HFSC subjects are a well educated group of individuals who generally
have high status jobs. (Jobs in the
NORC range of 72-75 include those of
chiropractors, designers, teachers, buyers and store department heads, and
federal civil service administrators.)
Their ages are sufficiently advanced that
they probably will not show marked further increases in occupational level.

tional attainment with that person’s occupational attainment. The correlations
of family background and cognition with
educational and occupational attainment were similar for the subset of subjects who took the EPI, CPS, and 16PF,
and the results for this subsample will be
presented in terms of multiple regression solutions.
As can be seen in Table 2, the family
(background indices are consistently pos=itively correlated with subjects’ educa“tional attainment. The magnitude of
Sthese correlations is only moderate.
5 This finding accords with White’s (1982)
A review of the literature which concludes
cothat, when individuals are the units of
qanalysis, socioeconomic status (SES) is
only moderately positively associated
‘swith school achievement for subjects
astill attending school or just completing
Stheir education. As might be expected,

cognitive abilities are positively correlated with educational attainment, with
verbal ability producing the highest correlations.

Consistent with other studies using
other personality measures on schoolage subjects, the ACL scale ““Ego Organization,” reflective of “goal orientation” or “‘superego strength,”’ is
positively correlated with educational
attainment, though not as strongly as
one might assume. Hopkins et al.
(1982), in a review of studies using Cattell’s personality scales, found that “‘superego strength” declines in importance
for college-age subjects in predicting
school achievement.

“Internal Discomfort” (“‘neuroticism’’) is negatively associated with educational attainment and, interestingly,
“Intraception,’’ which seems to be measuring ‘“‘rebelliousness,” (as well as such

attributions as reflectiveness and idealism) is positively related to final educational attainment. (It should be noted
that these subjects had completed their
education several decades before testing, since their mean ages, across sexes
and ethnic groups, were in the mid 40’s. )
The obtained correlations of these variables with educational attainment are
fairly consistent across both ethnicity
and sex.

From Table 3 it can be seen that educational attainment ts a strong predictor
of occupation! attainment, and one
would expect correlations of family
background, cognitive ability, and personality with occupational attainment to
be similar to those found for educational
attainment. The correlations of the family background items with occupational
attainment are similar to those found for

educational attainment and are consistent across ethnicity, in spite of the
AJA’s parents coming from a lower socloeconomic stratum than those of the
AEA subjects (see Table 1). In accord
with previous reports, the subjects’ occupational status is positively correlated
with cognitive ability (see Table 3) for
both the first principal component (an
index of “global IQ”’) and for some of
the factor scores. Again, verbal ability
shows the strongest relation to occupational attainment, as it did for educational attainment.

A most striking aspect of these cognition correlations is the difference between ethnic groups in the magnitude of
the correlations. For verbal ability and
the first principal component, the AJA
correlation with occupational attainment is 0.15 to 0.20 higher than the
Vol. 30, No. 1

same-sex AEA correlation. Sex differences here are minimal. Sex differences
are notable in the correlations of the
ACL scales with occupational status
(see Table 3). For the males the correlations of the ACL scales with occupational attainment are similar to those
found for educational attainment, although somewhat attenuated. For the
females there were no significant correlations.
s As shown in Tables 2 and 3, a subS ject’s father’s occupational status does
have an influence on the educational
® and occupational status of his adult chilAdren, whether through the provision of
genes (to the degree that occupation is
determined by ability and that ability
cohas a genetic component) and/or an environment (amount of education, other
‘gfamily circumstances) related to vocaSuional interests. A subj ject’s parent’s oc‘Ocupational status might also be expected

presents the correlations of the subject’s
father’s occupational status with the
subject’s cognition factor and ACL
scores. These correlations are for the
most part modest and fairly consistent
across ethnic groups and sexes. In accord with Jenck’s suggestion (e.g., 1972,
p. 179), the influence of parental occupational status would not appear to be as
strong as usually is assumed.

From Table 4 it can be seen that associations do exist between family background and cognition and personality
measures. We have presented data elsewhere (Nagoshi et al., 1982) showing
that there are far more correlations between an individual’s scores on measures of cognition and on measures of
personality than expected on a chance
basis. Because of these intercorrelations, multiple regression analyses were
accomplished to establish whether cognitive ability had a significant effect over
and above family background on educa
Stive abilities and personality. Table 4 tional and occupational attainment,

has roughly the same influence across
sexes and ethnicity, with personality factors reflecting ‘‘rebelliousness”’ or ‘“‘nonconformity” accounting for a significant
amount of variance over and above that
accounted for by family background and
cognitive ability. The direction of causality here is, of course, debatable.
With regard to occupational attainment (Table 6) family background is

roughly equally important for males and
females and for AEA’s and AJA’s, but
is for the most part insignificant. Cognitive ability was a strong predictor of occupational attainment for all but AEA
females (AEA’s comprised half of the
cases in the subsample), this particular
group being notably less predictable in
their occupational attainment. For all

to be associated with the subject’s personality), significantly increases the variance accounted for in the regressions
for males. CPS Egocentrism and 16PF
Shrewd seem to reflect the same Machiavellianism factor studied by Turner and
Martinez (1977). For the most part, personality was not a significant factor in
the occupational attainment of females.

The lack of consistently significant variance accounted for by the ACL may be
due to the present scales not being sensitive to the apparently important Machiavellian dimension of personality.

DISCUSSION

The essence of prejudice is to fail to
recognize individual differences within a
given group. While stereotyping would
be expected to lower the correlations of
personal characteristics with occupational attainment, the results of this
study demonstrate that in many cases
the correlations are actually higher for
the AJA group than for the AEA’s. Sexual stereotyping does not seem to have
had a profound effect on the final educational attainment of the present sample,
with the possible exception of AEA females, for whom family background had
a stronger determining effect. Correlations and overall predictability on this
variable are otherwise qute similar
across sexes.

A case for sexual discrimination may
be made with regard to occupational attainment from the notably reduced predictability of AEA females (most of
whom were not working outside the
home at the time of testing) and the lack
of significant correlations were personality for all females on this variable. Although there is only a small difference
between sexes in mean NORC ratings
(see Table 1), we did not collect data in
this sample regarding differences in salaries between sexes, and it is possible
that here some discrimination would
have been evident.

So far as we are aware, the present
report is the first to report for males and
females, Caucasian and non-Caucasian,
data regarding the association of family
background, cognitive ability, and per
Johnson et al.

sonality with educational and occupational attainment. Family background,
cognitive ability, and personality appear
to be associated with educational attainment to much the same degree, overall,
for the four groups, with the possible exception of AEA females noted above.!
This similarity is found in spite of the
AJA subjects’ parents coming from a
lower socioeconomic stratum than those
of the AEA subjects (see Table 1). For
this AJA generation, there was apparently a strong commitment to education
as a means of upward mobility, regardless of the parents’ own educational and
occupational attainment. With the exceptions noted above, there is also a fair
degree of similarity across groups in the
associations of family background, cognitive ability, personality, and own education with occupational attainment. In
general, family background has relatively less influence on either educational or occupational attainment than is
commonly believed.

The term ‘‘meritocracy” has been
used to describe a society in which occupational success results from personal
attributes, rather than from family influence or other extra-individual factors. In these terms, the present data
suggest that the United States has been
significantly (although perhaps not
strongly) meritocratic during the decades since our subjects entered the work
force. On the other hand, even with all
of this information available regarding
each subject, less than half of the variance is accounted for. Workers themselves do not attribute their occupational
choices to chance factors (Salomone and

'High negative betas on some of the family
background measures reflect suppressor effects resulting from the high intercorrelations among the
family background measures.
