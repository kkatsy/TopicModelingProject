Mortality Transition Among the Wends

of Serbin, Texas, 1854-1884:
Changes in Pattern of Death
from Parochial Records

ABSTRACT: Investigating cause of death is important in the study of mortality. Most studies,
however, deal with aggregate national samples and rely on civil death certificates filled out by
physicians. Little or no research has been done using parochial burial registers for individuallevel cause of death. This article investigates causes of death between 1854 and 1884 among the
Wends of Serbin, Texas, a nineteenth-century European immigrant community. The goal is: (1)
to show that data pertaining to individual cause of death extracted from parochial records can
contribute to knowledge about historical mortality patterns at the community level, (2) to
determine if an epidemiological transition occurred in this population, and (3) to identify changes
in disease patterns over time. Changes in the pattern of disease for the entire population as well
as for the subpopulation under one year of age are analyzed.

Investigating cause of death is an integral part of the study of mortality. In
general, cause-of-death data are obtained from civil rather than religious
documents. While there are European
examples of parochial records being
used to examine cause of death from
Great Britain (Cobb, 1983a, 1983b)
and France (Azemar, 1984), parochial
records pertaining to cause of death
have yet to be exploited in the United
States. In part, this reflects the lack of
awareness of these data; however,
some researchers are unwilling to use
causes of death that have been assigned by someone other than a medical professional. This limits research
possibilities to contemporary populations with well-developed and wellmaintained death registration systems.
Unfortunately, this excludes research
into the historical antecedents of ageand cause-specific mortality rates and

ignores the role of folk medicine providing valid medical data which reflect
a society’s knowledge of disease.

This article investigates cause of
death among the Wends of Serbin,
Texas—a nineteenth-century European immigrant community—between
1854 and 1884. My goal is threefold:
(1) to show that data pertaining to
individual-level cause of death extracted from parochial records can contribute to knowledge about historical
mortality patterns at the community
level; (2) to determine if evidence of an
epidemiological transition exists for
the Wendish population between 1854
and 1884; and (3) to identify changes in
disease patterns in the Wends over
time. I have analyzed the data (which
are described below) in two ways.
First, in order to look for an epidemiological transition (or the beginnings of
one) and determine changes in disease

266

 
Vol. 38, No. 3-4

patterns, individual level cause of
death for all age intervals are analyzed.
Second, in order to examine changes in
the pattern of infant mortality, ages at
death during the first year of life are
analyzed.

The Texas Wends provide a unique
opportunity for studying the demographic structure of an immigrant community because they came to the

United States as a coherent community
transplanted from Germany. While the
SWends were part of the greater population of German immigrants, they reemained a distinct ethnic group in
301 exaS, Maintaining their Wendish herGitage in the face of Germanization and
~Americanization forces on the fron“tier. It is ironic that the Wends left
“Germany to get away from Germans
Sand then settled in the center of Ger‘Sman Texas. Until the early twentieth
‘Scentury, even with the decline of the
‘sWendish language as a binding force,
the Wends still recognized themselves
“as a coherent community distinct from
‘Cother immigrants. More importantly,
the Germans in the area recognized
2them as a community apart from other
ST exas Germans.
3 The thirty years between 1854 and
1884 are divided into two periods, 1854
through 1868 (Period I) and 1869
through 1883 (Period II), in order to
compare two distinct periods in the life
of this community. Period I encompasses the voyage to Texas, setting up
a new community, economic and nutritional stress, adapting to the rigors
of frontier life, and the Civil War and
its aftermath. Period II is a time of relative peace, prosperity, and economic
stability for this population. These different socioeconomic climates may
create distinct disease environments

influenced by community practices and
standards which can be measured and
profiled.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

The Wends are the remnants of
Slavic tribes who once occupied the region between the Elbe and Oder rivers. Lusatia, the Wendish homeland, is
now part of the German states of Saxony and Prussia. Linguistically, socially, and culturally, Wends are similar to neighboring Slavic groups such as
Poles and Czechs. Since the time of
their initial domination by Germans
about nine hundred years ago, the
Wends have been an oppressed minority who until recently had continually
been coerced to drop their own traditions in favor of German language and
culture. This climate of oppression and
persecution spawned two large Wendish migrations in the mid-nineteenth
century, one to Australia and one to
Texas. In September, 1854, a group of
about 600 Wends left their home in
Germany to establish a ““Wendenland”
free from religious, political, and economic persecution and settled in an
area now located in Lee County,
Texas. Serbin, the original Wendish
settlement, today is only a signpost, a
historical marker, and a general store.
Never a nucleated settlement, it was a
community centered around the
Wendish mother church, St. Paul’s
Lutheran. Serbin denotes an area of
Wendish settlement rather than a specific geographic location.

This group of Wends decided to migrate to Texas because of glowing reports received from several Wendish
families who left for Texas in the 1830’s
and 1840’s. The early Wendish Texans

sent letters home with accounts of how
Texas was just like their homeland—
the environment, the kinds of crops
that could be grown, the people, and
anything and everything else imaginable. The Wendish homeland in Germany is in the Spreewald, a river and
forest environment with a cool climate.
Several of the ethnographic sources refer to this area as the “Venice of Germany”’ (Simpich, 1923; Nielson, 1977).
The Wends lived on small islands in the
Spree River where their small family
farms were located. They used boats
for transportation, and even moved
cattle from one island pasture to another using small barges. The staples of
their diet in Germany were cucumbers
and river eels, supplemented by other
food crops that could be grown on their
island farms such as wheat and rye.
Texas was a big surprise to this
group of Wends. They landed at the
Port of Galveston, Texas, in December, and it was hotter than the summers back home. From Galveston they
moved to Houston where several of the
more wealthy and influential Wendish
leaders began the process of buying
land. For many weeks they attempted
to purchase land similar to their homeland in Germany, but finally settled on
a league of land in Fayette County
(now Lee County) completely different from anything with which they
were familiar because they could not
afford better land. The land was
swampy, rocky, and sandy with few
clean water supplies. Finally, as the
Wendish settlers slowly began moving
in from Houston about one hundred
miles away, they arrived in the midst of

a drought that was to last for several |

years. The land cost more than they
had expected to pay which left them in
terrible financial circumstances as well.

 

 

Social Biology

As a community, they were not able to
buy many supplies necessary for adequate food and housing. The first winter and the first few years as well were
a difficult time for the group. They had
to learn how to grow unfamiliar crops,
such as corn and sweet potatoes for
food and cotton for revenue. They ate
venison and bear until they could establish farms with cattle and hogs.
Many families were forced to put off
building houses and wound up living in
dugouts which were damp, badly ventilated holes in the ground.

The Civil War and its aftermath was
a turning point for the community.
Economically, the Wends flourished as
a result of running cotton through the
Confederate blockade to Mexico
where it was then sold to the Union.
With economic prosperity also came
improvements in their standard of living. Suitable housing was built, and
clean, year-long water supplies were
located and used. As they adapted to
their new environment, they learned to
grow new crops and eat new foods. The
ethnographic sources and the parochial
death records indicate a clear transition for the community from substandard diet and housing and a high
infectious/parasitic disease load to adequate nutrition, adequate housing,
and the partial elimination of the
infectious/parasitic disease load as the
result of year-long, clean, water supplies. More detailed descriptions of the
Wends may be found in Blasig (1951),
Caldwell (1961), Engerrand (1935),
Fliess (1986), Grider (1982), and Nielson (1977).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data for this study were obtained from parochial records, specifi

cally, the earliest burial register of St.
Paul’s Lutheran Church in Serbin,
Texas. Between 1854 and 1884, Johann
Kilian, the original pastor of St. Paul’s,
recorded the deaths of 496 individuals.
He also recorded age at death, frequently the date of birth, cause of
death, marital status, and the decedent’s survivors. In the case of infants,
he recorded age in hours and days at
death. Based on his recording scheme,
Sthe difference between live-born inplants who died after a few hours and
stillbirths is discernible. Earlier demographic research on this population
A(Fliess, 1986, 1988a, b, 1989) linked
Sthese burial records with marriage,
+baptism, census, and genealogy data so
“that the date of birth is known for alSmost every individual. While it is usu‘Sally assumed that there is significant
-=inder-enumeration of infant deaths in
=historical populations, this is not the
~ case for the Wends. Other research usSing these data indicate that information
‘Zon infants, including the recording of
Sdeaths, is extraordinarily complete for
‘San historical population. The fact that
‘> Virtually all stillbirths are listed in the
baptism as well as the burial register
during this thirty-year period indicates
<the completeness of these records (for
5a detailed description of the linkage
process and the data, see Fliess, 1986,
1988a).

In the burial register Kilian recorded the most prominent symptom
at the time of death, using a symptomatic rather than a strictly medical diagnostic system. Either the pastor assigned the cause of death or the family
reported it to him, since it is unlikely
that Kilian was at the deathbed of every individual in his congregation. Killan or the families were assigning cause
of death or most prominent symptom

at the time of death because there were
no nearby physicians between 1854 and
1884. The ethnographic sources never
mention the presence of a physician in
the community. The only evidence that
there may have been one is an historical marker near St. Paul’s Lutheran
Church indicating there was a physician in the community during 1868.
Deaths recorded during 1868 are no
more precise, with respect to medical
terminology, than during the other 29
years.

The parish registers for St. Paul’s
were recorded in German up to about
1930. German was considered to be the
language of education and the educated among the Wends in Texas as
well as among the Wends in Germany.
Unfortunately, a few entries were illegible or cause of death was not recorded. Of the 496 entries, 37 (7.45 per
cent) were not translated, leaving a
sample size of 459. An assortment of
German-English dictionaries, German
medical dictionaries, English medical
dictionaries, and the International
Classification of Disease (World
Health Organization, 1977) were used
to translate each cause of death recorded.! This was done for two reasons: (1) to translate folk causes of
death into biomedical terms, and (2) to
translate the data into English in order
to facilitate analysis. For example, two
causes of death recorded at relatively
high frequency were ‘“‘gallen fieber’’

and ‘“‘nervenfieber.”’ Translated into
English, they are bile fever and nerve
fever, respectively. In biomedical
terms, they are malaria and typhoid or
typhoid fever. To increase the probability that these translations are correct, they were accepted only when at
least two of the sources used in trans
- Jation agreed with one another.

The data were translated into a biomedical model rather than keeping the
folk categories of death for two basic
reasons. First, this is an historical data
set. Unfortunately, there are no living
informants with whom the folk categories of death can be checked and who
can add further explanations to some
of the more limited categories. As a result, converting these data into somewhat restricted biomedical categories
(see Table 1) is a more useful approach. Second, the biomedical model
is useful for making these data compatible with other data sets and comparable across time and space.

Once all the causes of death were
translated into English and a biomedical cause of death assigned, each was
then assigned an ICD code. The /nternational Classification of Diseases
(World Health Organization, 1977) or
ICD standardizes the classification of
disease in order to make the reporting
of disease and the calculation of mortality rates comparable over time and
space. There are 17 major classifications such as “Infectious and Parasitic
Disease” and “‘Diseases of the Respiratory System.” Under these classifications each cause of death is assigned a
three-digit code which may also have a
decimal extension allowing more precision. For example, the general rubric
for cholera is ICD code 001 but cholera
due to Vibrio cholerae is assigned

Social Biology

001.0, cholera due to Vibrio cholera el
tor is assigned 001.1, and unspecified
cholera is assigned 001.9. This allowed
grouping by classes of diseases. Using
this scheme is preferable to the classification of causes of death devised by
McKeown (1979) because it allows for
the examination of historical mortality
patterns using techniques applicable to
the analysis of contemporary mortality. Rutenberg (1985) provided a listing of causes of death extracted from
the census mortality schedules and historical death certificates. This list was
useful for determining how to classify
several causes of death. For example,
“dropsey” refers to some type of cardiovascular disease.

The original analysis attempted to
examine these data by major ICD disease Classifications. This proved unsatisfactory for examining the pattern of
disease and determining whether or
not an epidemiological transition occurred. As a result, the ICD classifications are collapsed into five main categories:2 (1) pre-transition causes
(with four subdivisions), (2) posttransition causes (with 2 subdivisions),
(3) diseases of early childhood (conditions originating during the perinatal
period), (4) external causes (such as
falls, drownings, etc.), and (5) all other
and unknown causes (see Table 1).
These categories maximize what we
can learn from these data while simplifying and facilitating analysis. Sexspecific analyses were not attempted
because sample size is moderate.

This scheme was suggested by Dr. Benjamin S.
Bradshaw of the University of Texas School of Public Health at San Antonio.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL TRANSITION

Omran (1977, p. 4) defines an epidemiological transition as the “‘shifting
web of health and disease patterns in
population groups and their links with
several demographic, social, economic, ecologic and biologic changes.”
Further, he suggests (Omran, 1971,
1977) a three stage epidemiological
transition: (1) Stage I, The Age of Pestilence and Famine, which is characterized by high, fluctuating mortality; (2)
Stage I], The Age of Receding Pandemics, which is characterized by progressively declining mortality, and (3)
Stage III, The Age of Degenerative
and Man-Made Diseases, which is
characterized by a declining and finally
stabilized low level of mortality. He
believes that Stage IT begins in the
United States about 1850 while Stage
III begins between 1920 and 1930 (Omran, 1977, pp. 17-18). The question
now is whether or not the Wends fit
this model, or if a different pattern
emerges in this population.

Table 1 reports numbers of deaths
using the classification scheme listed
above as well as Proportionate Mortality Ratios (PMR’s) for Periods I (185468) and II (1869-83) and the per cent
change in the PMR’s for each classification. The Proportionate Mortality
Ratio represents the proportion of total deaths that are due to a specific
cause (Last, 1984; Lilienfeld and Lilienfeld, 1980), and it is usually multiplied by 100 and expressed as a percentage. The Proportionate Mortality
Ratio is a useful method for determining changes in the patterns and distribution of diseases. Figure 1 graphically
reports the PMR’s. Several differences

Mortality Transition

271

between Period I and Period II are
readily apparent. There is an overall
decrease in the impact of pre-transition
causes and a concomitant increase in
the impact of post-transition causes on
mortality. The most obvious change is
the substantial reduction in the impact
of infectious and parasitic diseases on
mortality. In Period I almost 50 per
cent of total mortality was the result of
infectious and parasitic diseases, while
in Period II they account for less than
30 per cent of total mortality.

This decrease in infectious and parasitic diseases coincides with changes
in living conditions (Blasig, 1951; Caldwell, 1961; Engerrand, 1935; Grider,
1982; Nielson, 1977). During the first
15 years of this community, swamps
were drained, clean yearlong water
supplies were located and used, and
suitable housing was built. During the
early years, many families lived in dugouts, which were damp, badly. ventilated holes in the ground. Many also
had their privy pits either in the dugout
or next to it. In addition, food supplies
were scarce during the first few years
and during the Civil War. It is not unreasonable to expect that as living
conditions improved the frequency of
infectious and parasitic diseases declined. ,

The increase in the pre-transition
category “colic and fever” is puzzling.
This category contains the biomedical
causes of death in both periods attributed to unspecified colic and pyrexia
(fever) of unspecified origin. For now,
I am being conservative in how I treat
this category, keeping it separate from
rather than adding it to “Infectious and
Parasitic Diseases.” Colic and fever
are sO vague that without more information I am hesitant to assign them to

another category. In Period I, unspecified colic accounts for 55.6 per cent of
the deaths in this category and fever of
unspecified origin accounts for 44.4 per
cent. In Period II the percentages are
58.5 and 41.5, respectively, so the
breakdown for both periods is similar.
Unfortunately, this comparison does
not shed any light on the reason for the
PMR increasing from about 13 to
about 18.5 per cent. This increase may
be an artifact of changes in Kilian’s reporting toward the end of his life. We
know from ethnographic sources
(Blasig, 1951; Caldwell, 1961; Engerrand, 1935; Grider, 1982; Nielson,
1977) that he was quite il] toward the
end of his life. Therefore, the increase
in the PMR may reflect a change in his
relying on causes of death reported by
others rather than on his own firsthand
observation. Interestingly, all those
who die from colic in both time periods
are 3 years of age or younger, except
for one individual almost 60 years old

in Period I, while those who die from
fever are bimodally distributed. Combining both time periods, 54.5 per cent
are under ten years of age while the remainder are more or less evenly distributed between 20 and 70 years of
age. Both colic and fever, therefore,
are important causes of death after the
neonatal periods (after day 27) and in
early and middle childhood.

These data do allow us to evaluate
Omran’s model with respect to the
Wendish population. There is an emergent pattern of change between Period
I and Period II from mortality due to
pre-transition causes with the preponderance of deaths attributed to infectious and parasitic diseases (Omran’s
Stage III) to mortality due to posttransition causes or degenerative diseases (Omran’s Stage II). This is not
to say that infectious and parasitic diseases did not have an impact on mortality in Period II; they accounted for
almost 30 per cent of total mortality be

tween 1869 and 1884. A new pattern,
however, emerges in Period II which
broadly follows Omran’s model. The
timing may be slightly different than
that which Omran (1977) suggests for
the aggregate United States population
but the sequence of mortality etiology
is remarkably similar.

INFANT MORTALITY

According to Weller and Bouvier
(1981, p. 197) and Bouvier and van der
Tak (1976), it has generally been assumed that neonatal mortality was
primarily endogenous in nature (mortality due to genetic anomalies, conditions of prenatal life, and the birth process) while post-neonatal mortality was
primarily exogenous in nature (mortality due to external causes such as infectious disease). It appears now, however, that endogenous infant mortality
may only be important during the first

three or four days of life. Endogenous
mortality has a typically biological
character while exogenous mortality is
viewed as preventable to a much
greater degree (Shryock and Siegal,
1980, p. 405). If this is true, we should
expect two patterns to emerge. First,
we would expect the bulk of infant
deaths to shift from neonatal to postneonatal mortality between Periods |
and II. Second, we would expect the
bulk of neonatal mortality between
Days 0 and 4 in Period I, while in Period II we would expect it after Day 4.
Both of these patterns are evident in
this community (Table 2). Clearly,
there is a shift from neonatal to postneonatal deaths. In Period I, over 65
per cent of infant deaths are neonatal
while in Period II approximately 41 per
cent of infant deaths are neonatal.
There is also a clear shift in the timing
of neonatal deaths. In Period I, 58 per

cent of neonatal deaths occur between

‘Day 0 and Day 4; while in Period II,

only 18.5 per cent of neonatal deaths
occur in this time interval. There is an
obvious change in the pattern of infant
deaths over time in this community.
‘Some researchers have suggested
that what we really need to be looking
for is a shift from exogenous to endogenous infant deaths because this finding would indicate better medical and
overall conditions (see, for example,
Shryock and Siegal, 1980). This particular pattern, however, does not seem
consistent with this population. The
most important shift among the Wends
seems to be from neonatal to postneonatal mortality. In Period I, the
Wends had just arrived on the Texas
frontier. The burden of disease was
quite high during this time, and neither
sanitation nor nutrition were good. It
would not be surprising for pregnant

women who were debilitated by infectious disease, brackish water, belowoptimal nutrition, and substandard
housing to have stillbirths and livebirths which died within the first few
days of life. It makes sense that early
neonatal deaths decrease in Period II
as overall conditions among this population improved. The bulk of infant
mortality in Period II is post-neonatal
(days 28 through 364) and is attributable to infectious disease. So the
change we see in the pattern of infant
mortality may be the result of better
maternal health during pregnancy,
which in turn may be the result of better living conditions. A further indication of the shift in the pattern of infant
mortality is the change in the Perinatal
Mortality Rate, or the number of

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

I have documented mortality
change over a 30-year period among a
mid-nineteenth century European immigrant community in Texas. Between
1854 and 1884 the Wends experienced
a change in pattern of mortality. This
change is observed for both the general
population and the subpopulation under one year of age. For the general
population the impact of pre-transition
causes decreases while post-transition
causes take a greater toll. With respect
to infant mortality, a clear transition
from neonatal to post-neonatal mortality is evident.

This study has two basic implications. First, it is worthwhile to look at
mortality change at the community as
well as the large-scale aggregate level.
It is only through these types of studies
that we can see the variation often
masked by the aggregate data approach. In this community we can see
the beginnings of an epidemiological
transition similar to that described by
Omran (1971, 1977), but beginning 40
to 50 years earlier than he proposes for
the national aggregate population of

*During Period I there were 415 births and during Period II there were 515 births recorded in the
baptism registers of St. Paul’s Lutheran Church.

the United States. The question now is
what makes this population different?
This warrants further research. More
community studies are necessary in order to determine if the Wends are truly
different, or if Omran’s model of epidemiological transition needs to be reworked. The second and perhaps the
more important implication concerns
the data—cause of death extracted
from parochial records. At present,
within the context of examining historical mortality in the United States this
is a unique data set. As far as I have
been able to determine, parochial
records have not been used to look at
cause of death in the United States. It
is, however, not unique. With some
detective work other parochial records
of this type can be located throughout
the United States and be used for similar types of community level investigation.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

I would like to thank Pastor Paul Hartfield and the congregation of St. Paul’s
Lutheran Church for allowing me to use
their church records; Drs. Myron P. Gutmann, Benjamin S. Bradshaw, and Mark
Fossett for their comments on earlier
drafts; and my colleague Dr. Marie I.
Boutte for her insightful and important
comments through eighteen months and
countless successive drafts of this paper.
