Effect of Number and Position of Siblings
on Child and Adult Outcomes

ABSTRACT: In this paper we consider how family size and birth order may affect educational
attainment and earnings. Family size may be important because if more children have to share
parental financial, emotional, and time resources, each child may get less. Birth order may be
important because of differences in endowments, parental resources over the life cycle, or parental preferences. We demonstrate how these different factors interact in a particular model.
Empirically we find both birth-order and family-size effects for schooling even when controlling for parental age, income, and education and father’s religion. These effects are bigger for
daughters than sons. Using the same controls, we do not find statistically significant family-size
or birth-order effects for the 1n of earnings in a relatively young sample. We also present equations for how college was financed. Family size cuts down parental contribution per child and
encourages working, scholarship, and loans. Results differ somewhat for sons and daughters.

In this paper we consider why birth or satisfaction. In our models, U deorder and sibship size may affect educa- pends on household or parental contional attainment of a child and subse- sumption (C) and on the future conquent adult earnings. We consider sev- sumption =income (Y) of each child.

INVESTMENT AND PARENTAL
UTILITY MAXIMIZATION
MODELS FOR DETERMINING
DEMAND FOR EDUCATION

Economists have developed two basic general models to explain educational attainment. The older of these is
the so-called investment model, which
was elegantly derived by Becker (1967).
In this model education makes an individual more productive and aj] returns
to schooling are translatable into extra
wages. It is generally assumed that each
additional year of schooling adds ever
smaller increments to earnings. In this
model a person stops investing when the
expected rate of return on the marginal
investment in schooling equals the marginal interest rate. This model is vague
on who makes decisions—the parents or
the child—and does not indicate how
parents allocate among children scarce
resources such as funds for tuition.

To examine these issues economists
have developed parental utility maximization models. Two special models,
both nested in the more general model,
have been examined in detail. Becker
and Tomes (1976) assume that the parents’ utility function contains terms
defined as the sum of each child’s earnings and income from financial bequests.! The alternative model developed by Behrman (1982, 1985),
hereafter BPT, and Behrman and Taubman (1985) assumes that a child’s earnings and income from bequests are individual arguments in the utility function
and are separable from one another in
the parents’ utility function. These two
models reduce to each other when there

are no financial bequests, a common situation, but differ in an important respect if there are bequests.

In particular, both define compensating (reinforcing) behavior to occur when
parents provide less (more) resources to
purchase schooling to the child who is
better endowed, i.e., has the greater E.
In Becker and Tomes’ model, a parent
compensates (reinforces) if the earnings
production function is such that the impact of investment in a child on potential
earnings increases (declines) as the endowment of that child increases (i.e.,
é?Y/(aEAK) <0 (>0)). In contrast, in
BPT’s model, the parents’ compensation decision depends on the extent of
parental inequality aversion in their utility function in addition to the nature of
the production function. The BeckerTomes criterion does not hold in the
BPT model.

In BPT (1982), we discuss the scanty
evidence available to distinguish the
Becker and Tomes’ versus the BPT’s
model. We argued that existing results
tend to support our model, a conclusion
that subsequently has been reinforced
by Menchik (1984), but the issue is far
from settled. In the rest of this paper we
use our version of the parental utility
maximizing model.

THE BPT PARENTAL UTILITY
MAXIMIZATION MODEL

We can construct an indifference
curve which indicates all combinations
of two children’s potential earnings ( Y;)
which leave the parents equally well off.
The curvature and the location of such
an indifference curve indicate the extent
of parental inequality concern and
whether one child is preferred by the
parents in the sense that the parents

24 Taubman and Behrman

weigh more heavily equal outcomes for
that child than for a sibling.

Three such hypothetical indifference
curves are given in Figure 1. First we
consider the curvature of these curves.
The straight line A,BAz2 illustrates the
case in which the parents are indifferent
to the distribution of potential earnings
among their children and only care
about the sum of their children’s earnings. This is a pure investment case. The
right angle B,BB, illustrates the other
Rawlsian extreme of pure inequality
concern, in which parents obtain increased utility from providing more
earnings to the better endowed sib only
after the other child has the same potential earnings as this sib. Other indifferences curves, like C,BC), fall between
these extremes and indicate differing
degrees of tradeoffs between equity and
investment concerns in the parental utility function.

Now we ccnsider the location of the
lines relative to a 45° ray from the origin.
In Figure 1 the curves are symmetrical

different tradeoffs between investment and distribution, but with equal concern over expected
earnings outcomes for children.

 

Social Biology

around the 45° ray. This means the parents exhibit equal concern or that the
parents weigh equally in their preferences equal outcomes for the two children. For a given distribution of expected earnings outcomes between two
children, say $20,000 per year for one
child and $25,000 for the other, the parents are indifferent about which child receives which earnings level. In Figure 2,
however, the curve with the intermediate curvature has been moved to the
right so that it no longer is symmetrical
around the 45° ray line. A move to the
right means that parents favor child one
over child two. The parents clearly prefer a distribution of $25,000 per year to
child one and $20,000 to child two over
the opposite. The parents exhibit unequal concern, in this case favoring child
one.

Whatever the curvature and location
of a representative parental indifference
curve, a particular household will have a
whole set of these curves, as is indicated
in Figure 3. Since higher levels of expected earnings of their children reasonably can be assumed to improve paren

tal welfare, ceteris paribus, C,“C,” represents a locus of preferred combinations of expected child earnings over
C,‘C,’, which in turn is a locus of preferred combinations over C,C).

The economic problem of the parents
is how to allocate the resources under
their control in order to have a combination of expected earnings between child
one and two which is on the highest possible parental indifference curve, ceteris
paribus. This is part of a larger problem
in which parents are maximizing their
utility as determined by their own consumption and the distribution of expected earnings and of bequests of all
their children. We focus here on the subproblem of how parents allocate a given
level of resources to investment in education among their children.* To facilitate geometric exposition, we concentrate on the two-children case.

To be able to examine this subproblem in isolation, we must assume (in the technical terminology of economics) that the allocation of such resources to investment in children is separable from
questions pertaining to the allocation of resources
to household consumption or to bequests.

We need to find out how the budget,
endowment, and production constraints
limit the choices in Figure 3. Conceptually, we can ask how much schooling the
fixed amount of resources would buy if
spent on child one. Given this schooling
and child one’s endowments, we can determine his or her earnings by using the
production function. The result is the
point D, in Figure 4. Next we reduce educational expenditures on child one by
$1 and spend it on education for child
two, thereby increasing his or her expected earnings. All the possible earnings outcomes for the two children are
given as D,D> in Figure 4. Such a curve
is called an earnings possibility frontier
since it indicates the highest possible
earnings combinations possible for the
children of this family given the resources devoted to investment in the
children’s education, the children’s endowments, and the resource constraints. If more resources were allocated to investment in the children’s
education or if the children’s endowments were increased, the frontier
would move outwards. If the endow

ment of one child were larger relative to
that of the other child, the frontier
would be skewed further out for the
former child. Note that D,D, is curved
because we are assuming diminishing returns to schooling. The maximization
subproblem is solved by finding the
highest indifference curve tangent to
D,D . This is shown at X in Figure 5.

Within the context of this model,
birth-order effects can occur because of
systematic differences either in D,D2 or
in the indifference curves. The points D;
and D2 depend on endowments, resources devoted to children’s education
that reflects parental income, and the
price of a year of schooling. Endowments may vary on average with birth
order because older mothers are more
likely to have children with birth defects
and may allocate resources differently.?
Family income and the amount saved
for education fluctuate over time, often
in an unforseen manner. In addition, future expected parental increases in earnings may not be good collateral.* Hence,
older children may find it more costly to
raise funds for college. The tuition price
of schooling also may vary over time, especially if the government introduces or
greatly alters various scholarship and
subsidy programs.°

Lindert (1977) has argued that the
oldest child benefits by having some period of exclusive attention from his or
her mother during which she improves
his or her stock of human capital. Available evidence from time budget studies
suggests that he is correct about mother’s time spent with each child. For instance, Liebowitz (1972) provides some

(1984c), and Leibowitz (1972).

and two.

evidence that parental time matters for
males in the top 2 per cent of the IQ distribution. We note that Lindert ignores
the possibility that a mother may be as
effective in reading one story to two children as to one. Lindert’s argument,
moreover, does not rule out Zajonc’s
(1972) model in which general household intellectuality and teaching of
younger by older children play important roles, primarily to the advantage of
the first born. Without too much stretching, we can think of all of these possibilities as equivalent to an increase in endowments in our general model.
Suppose, for example, that birth-order
production effects effectively increase
the endowments of child one while leaving those of child two unaltered, as in
the dashed earnings possibility frontier
in Figure 6. As is illustrated, the earnings possibility frontier moves out (except at D2), which leads to a new equilibrium at a higher level of parental
satisfaction at X’ at which the expected
earnings of child one definitely is increased. The expected earnings of child

two may be higher, lower, or the same—
depending on the exact movement in
the earnings production frontier and the
curvature in the parental indifference
curves. Except in the extreme case of
Rawlsian right-angle parental indifference curves, however, the expected
earnings of child one increases relative
to that of child two to the hypothetical
birth-order-associated effective endowment change favoring child one.

Birth-order differences also may exist due to the locations of the parental indifference curves relative to the 45° ray.
Suppose that parents are faced with a
given earnings possibility frontier, but
exhibit unequal concern that favors
child one. The rightward shifted indifference curves due to this birth-order
preference causes a higher expected
earnings for child one and lower expected earnings for child two, as compared with the case of parental equal
concern.

Of course there may be both production and preference effects of birth order, in which case the final outcome depends upon whether the two effects
work in the same or opposite direction,

and—in the latter case—which dominates.

The interrelationships between sibship size and the average quantity and
quality of schooling attainment have
been considered by a number of economists.° Most argue that for given income
children in larger families receive lower
quantity and quality of schooling.’ This
standard outcome can be determined
using the concepts and diagrams previously introduced. The greater the number of siblings the closer D,D; is to the
origin and each child receives less
schooling.’ The shape of the utility and
production functions would determine
how the overall schooling reduction is
shared.

AN EXAMPLE WITH EXPLICIT
FUNCTIONAL FORMS FOR THE
BPT PARENTAL MAXIMIZATION
MODEL

In previous work, we have examined
a model with particular functional forms
that allow us to obtain closed-form expressions for the within-family ratios of
schooling and earnings.

We use a utility function of the form

U = SaY; ~e<c<1. (1)

See, for example, Becker and Tomes (1976)
and Willis (1973).

"There is also a large body of empirical findings
that indicate a negative relationship between sibship size and years of schooling and adult earnings
(Behrman et al., 1980, provide a recent summary).
In BPT (19842) we also demonstrate that members
of larger sibships are less similar to one another in
terms of education completed. We speculated that
this occurs because children in larger families rely
less on parental wealth and more on other financing sources which have more individual specific
variation. We present some results which confirm
these arguments.

"In BPT (1984) we demonstrate that if the utility function is Ea(Y—6)*, then b may exert an offsetting influence. However, we always have found
b empirically to be near zero.

38 Taubman and Behrman

In this utility function, c = 1 indicates no
inequality aversion or the pure investment case, while c = ~ © is the Rawlsian
case with only concern about the expected earnings of the worst-off child.
The a; reflect parental unequal concern,
with child one being favored over child
two if a, > a2 and with equal concern as
the special case in which all a; are the
same.

We also use the following production
function and budget constraint

Y¥;=S7EP = O<a<1 (2)

=P}S =T (3)
where Y is earnings, S is years of schooling, PS is the price of schooling and T is
total parental resources devoted to children’s education.

This model yields the following solution for children one and two:

A quick inspection of (4) and (5) indicates that parents compensate by devoting more schooling to the less endowed
child if c is negative,’ though even with
compensation the better-endowed child
has higher expected earnings except in
the Rawlsian case. Note also that even if
a, = a and ps = PS, we would find
equal Y’s and S’s among sibs only if the
E’s are the same or if parental preferences are at the Rawlsian extreme.

Equations (4) and (5) indicate the effects of differences in endowments,
prices, and parental preferences on the
within-sib allocation on schooling and

the resulting impact on relative earnings. Consider first the impact of different preferences. A unit increase in a;/ap,
which means parents care more for sib
one relative to two, causes In (S;/S2) to

 

change by i=ac

and 1n Y;/Y2 to change by

 

1l—ac
Because of the bounds set on a and c,
both of these expressions are positive.
The bigger algebraically is a or c, the
larger is the impact on the In of either
ratio. An equal percentage change in
P3/P} has exactly the same impact on
the sibs’ 17 of schooling and earnings ratios as changes in @,/a.

Next, consider the impact of a 1 per
cent change in the relative endowments
favoring child one. In this case, in 1n S,/
52 the change is Bc/(1—ac), while in 1n
Y,/Y2 the change is B/(1—ac). Given
the bounds on the parameters, the
change in the ratio of the sib’s earnings is
non-negative and only yields equal
schooling for the sibs in the Rawlsian
case ifc = —«, The 1n of the ratio of the
schooling, however, is reduced if Cc is
negative.

Equations (4) and (5) can be estimated with data on prices, endowments, and dichotomous variables for
gender or birth order which distinguish
children in a family. Once estimated, it
is possible to identify a2/a;, a, cand B.

INTERHOUSEHOLD
COMPARISONS

Our model can also be used to study
interhousehold differences in earnings
and schooling. In particular, a reduced
form demand function for each child’s

schooling and earnings’ capacity can be

obtained. Each of these functions will
depend on the exogenous variables of

the price of schooling divided by the
price of parental consumption, parental
income, the child’s endowment, and the
parameters of the utility and the production function. We have argued earlier
that the birth order and family size effects can operate through several of
these mechanisms. Thus, we can not determine the source of the interhousehold differences in birth order or family
size from the reduced form. While it is
possible to obtain an explicit demand
function, it is a very complicated one;
hence, in the interhousehold analyses

’ we use linear and semilogarithmic ap
proximations.

EMPIRICAL ESTIMATES OF
BIRTH-ORDER AND
FAMILY-SIZE EFFECTS

We now tum to some new and recent
empirical results based on the NASNRC Twin and Adult Offspring Sample. The Twin Sample has been described in detail in Behrman et al.
(1980). Briefly, it contains data on some
1,000 pairs of identical and 900 pairs of
fraternal twins, all white male veterans
born between 1917 and 1927. They
have been surveyed several times.
Around 1980 we asked them to provide
names and addresses of their adult offspring to enable us to survey the children. We have about 4,000 children who
responded to our questionnaire and we
have school transcripts, obtained with
signed releases, for about 30 per cent of
these.

The birth-order information comes

For the most part, a twin pair is included in
the identical group if they answer affirmatively to
the question “In childhood were you as alike as
two peas in a pod?” This question is 95 per cent accurate for a subsample of this sample for which
blood tests provide a practically definitive identification.

from the father. The 1980 roster indicates when there are stepparents. In the
analysis that follows we have excluded
children with stepparents though we
would include some of their half siblings. We also include in our analysis
measures of family background since
Ernst and Angst (1984) make a compelling case that such treatment is necessary. We note that coefficient of sibship
size may be biased because it may be
chosen simultaneously with the alloca- .
tions to children. We find that exclusion
of family size increases in absolute value
the magnitude of the birth-order effects.

In (1985) we report in more detail the
results summarized in Table 1 for years
of schooling and for In earnings. We initially used a set of mutually exclusive
birth order dummies and found that the
coefficients declined approximately in a
linear fashion. To save space, we
present here the results using the number of children in the family. The regressions control for the age of each parent
when that child was born, father’s education, mother’s education, parental
earnings, and father’s religion. Since
similar results are obtained from the two
representations, we discuss here only
the ones obtained using the continuous
representation.

For females, the coefficient on birth
order in the schooling relation is a highly
significant —0.37. This sample has a
goodly number of fifth-, sixth-, and
seventh-born children. The difference
between first and fifth-born, even controlling for family background and number of siblings, 1s close to one-and-a-half
years of schooling, a huge difference.
The coefficient on the number of sibs
plus one is —0.05, which is not statistically significant (though in the dummy
variable representation this coefficient
is larger and significant at the 10 per cent

ings (adjusted for age), we do not find
either birth order or number of siblings
to be significant in the equations for 1n
earnings for males or females. However, for females, the dummy variables
are close to being significant if number
of siblings is not included. Here the controls matter more.

INTRAFAMILY ALLOCATIONS
AND HOUSEHOLD SIZE

Estimation of Equations (4) and (5)
would let us obtain unbiased estimates
of the parameters in our model. We
have not yet made these estimates because some necessary data only recently
have been obtained. However, in BPT

- (1982, 1985) and elsewhere we have

shown that it is possible to manipulate
our model to obtain

Siofr a (jc, (6)

53 P, Q2 Y2

Unfortunately, since both schooling and
earnings are choice or dependent variables estimates of parameters from (6)
may be biased. In BPT (1985), we show
that c is biased upward when we estimate Equation (6). Since we generally
find our estimate of c to be small and
positive, it seems clear that c is not one
and thus parents have some concern
over earnings inequality of their offspring.

It is possible that different types of
families have different values of c. We
estimate a new version of Equation (6)
in which we make c a linear function of
family size:

Family size has a small coefficient that is
nowhere near being statistically significant. The coefficient on First Born,
however, is statistically significant and
indicates that parents either give more
weight (prefer) later born children or
school prices are higher for first born.

FINANCING OF SCHOOLING

We also have some information on
how number of siblings and birth order
affect the financing of schooling. The
financing sources are work, scholarship,
parents, loans, and other. The students
were asked to give the percentage distribution for each source. We know the
college attended for about 1,000 students and of these we have data on parental income for about 80 per cent.
These students have similar means on
family background and own earnings
and schooling as those students in the
sample for whom the particular college
attended is not known.

The students went to college in different years. To standardize prices, we collected the tuition and room and board
data for 1975. The estimates for the
funding sources for a year of college are
given in Table 2.

Since this type of data is not often
available, we first briefly describe the
coefficient estimates for the various controls. For one year of college expenses,
father’s education is not statistically
significant, but mother’s education is
significant and positive in both the total
cost column and in the funds provided
by the parents column. Family income is
an important variable in the various
funding sources columns. The greater
the parents’ income the less the students
rely on working, scholarships, and loans
and the more they rely on parents, but in
the total column, the coefficient has a

“ft” statistic of only 1.2 in Table 2. Father’s religion does not have significant
effects, though Behrman et al. (1980)
find strong effects on the father’s own
education and 17 earnings.

The age of the father at the birth of
the particular child has significant quadratic impacts on the use of scholarships. The peak impact is at father’s age
of about 30 at the child’s birth and 48 at

the age of the child’s college matriculation. The latter age for the father is approximately the age at which earnings
profiles in a cross-section have peaked
for more highly educated people.
Daughters rely significantly less on loans
and receive more funds from parents
than sons.

Now we turn to the family-size and
birth-order effects. There are some interesting family-size effects. In Table 2,
the larger one’s family, the more heavily
one relies on scholarships and loans and
the less heavily on parental contributions. The difference between having
zero and four siblings is $260 in scholarships, $300 in loans, and nearly $800 less
from the parents per year. In these
yearly cost estimates, however, none of
the birth-order dummies are significant.

The cost figures weighted by years attended college are not shown since the
same pattern exists for family size as in
Table 2. The impact of a change from
zero to four siblings is about $1,000 in
extra scholarship aid, $850 in extra
loans, and a $3,000 smaller parental
contribution. The birth-order dummies
tend to have larger “‘t’ statistics than in
Table 2 and the first born have significantly more total or gross expenditures.

CONCLUSIONS

It is possible to model theoretically
the relationship between schooling,
eamings, and other child and adult outcomes on the one hand and birth order
and sibship size on the other. Sibship
size often is thought to affect the amount

of monetary and time resources available to each child. While demand for
some goods, such as beer, are known to
decline as income rises, we would expect
a positive income effect for schooling
and earnings. The empirical evidence
supports this view.

Birth-order effects can arise because
of differences in preferences, genetic
endowments, teaching opportunities, or
availability of parents time. In our data
set, birth-order effects are found for
both schooling and the 1n of earnings in
the raw data. Once we control for family
background and the sibship size, the
earnings data no longer display birthorder effects but the schooling data do,
The difference between first and fifth;

Sibship size also increases reliance on

years equation, though the lack of
significance elsewhere may be due to the”
small sample size. The first born spends
about $3,000 more in this case.
