Variations in Value Orientations and

Fertility Behavior

 

William B. Clifford and Thomas R. Ford

Department of Sociology and Anthropology, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina;
and Department of Sociology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky

The concept of value orientations has
been important in sociological and anthropological approaches to the understanding
of human behavior. However, despite their
potential significance for fertility analysis,
values and value orientations have been
infrequently discussed in the demographic
literature (Francis, 1961; Hillery, 1961;
Spengler, 1966; Kahl, 1968).

As used here, values refer to the basic
criteria which guide the behavior of the
members of a group sharing a common culture. They are the standards accepted by
a group for determining what is good or
bad, desirable or undesirable. A value orientation refers to the direction in which
behavior is guided or channeled as well as
to the influencing criteria (Ford, 1965a).

The omission of the value concept in
demographic literature on fertility behavior
may be associated in part with a rejection
of the usefulness of “values” and “value
orientations” on the grounds that they are
not adequate as explanatory agents. Referring to the value concept, Blake and Davis
(1964, p. 461) suggest, “Its usefulness does
not extend to causal explanation, because
the inferred value comes only from the
specific norms themselves and hence cannot be used as an explanation of these

norms.” Methodologically, this is probably
true in that one may get at values through
norms. The statement “people ought to
help each other” is not a value in strict
usage, but rather one manifestation of a
value (Kluckhohn, 1962, p. 396). However,
theoretically, value orientations stand in the
same relation to norms as norms stand to
sanctions; just as norms justify and specify the occasions for the application of sanctions, so values legitimize and give meaning
to norms (Smelser, 1967, p. 8).

The primary problem is (1) to identify
the values and value orientations associated with fertility or with variables which
affect fertility with enough precision to
utilize them in analysis and (2) to establish a nexus between these values and value
orientations and more immediate determinants of fertility.

One school, from which our theoretical
framework is drawn, holds that these values
are part of a configuration of value orientations which grow out of man’s effort to
solve basic problems common to all human
groups (Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck, 1961,
pp. 1-20). Those five problems especially
pertinent for this study concern: (1) the
accepted approach to the problem of mastering one’s physical and social environ

ment; (2) the significant time dimension;
(3) the dominant modality of man’s relationship to other men; (4) the dominant
modality of human activity; and (5) the
character of innate human nature (in this
case, an orientation to sex as good or evil).

It is further suggested that each value
orientation constitutes a conceptual continuum. The major or dominant orientations are summarized in Table 1. The two

family limitation should be associated with
modern orientations of mastery over the
outcome of events, long-range rational planning, behavior directed toward the realization of objective goals and primacy of goals
of the conjugal pair, and mutual gratification from sex relations.

In contrast, high family-size expectations, unplanned pregnancies, and high fertility should be associated with traditional

polar types for each of the value orientations are labeled “traditional” and ‘“modern” (for further discussion of these terms
related to values, see Clifford, 1969; Kahl,
1968; Stephenson, 1968; Ford, 1965d;
Gans, 1962; Whitely and Whitely, 1967;
Ehrman, 1961; Wilson, 1961; and Rainwater, 1965).

As also shown in Table 1, each value
orientation is theoretically associated with
varying degrees of fertility behavior. In
other words, different value orientations
are associated with different probabilities
of expected family size, birth control effectiveness, and actual fertility. Successful

orientations of fatalistic resignation, inability to link immediate experiences with future consequences, primacy of goals and
welfare of the extended family group, perception of sex as a duty, and so on. Thus,
for persons with traditional orientations,
the high fertility pattern may result from
the operation of chance occurrences and
failure to engage in long-range, rational
planning.t

It should be noted that we do not regard

value orientations may support high or low fertility behavior patterns is found in: Rainwater, 1960;

value orientations as being independent of
other factors that influence fertility behavior; rather, they are considered as intermediate factors in a developmental sequence that includes a variety of antecedent
variables. These variables influence value
orientations and through this influence may
also affect fertility behavior. One such set
of antecedent sociocultural factors is represented by the variable socioeconomic
status. It is well established that fertility
behavior varies with socioeconomic status.
Previously reported data (Clifford, 1969)
showed that higher socioeconomic status is
positively associated with most modern
value orientations. Modern nature, time,
relational, and sex orientations are generally
characteristic of high status wives and traditional orientations of low status wives.
The reverse is true only for orientation to
activity. The implications of this reversal
will be discussed later.

For reasons of brevity, the present analysis does not report the relationship between value orientations and fertility behavior with socioeconomic status controlled.
However, the introduction of such a control
did not materially alter the nature or
direction of the associations, although it
did reduce their magnitude.

Our primary purpose here is to report a
test of the following hypothesis regarding
attitudes toward nature, time, familial relations, activity, and sex: Wives who have a
modern orientation to any one of these
items will expect a smaller number of children, will have a smaller proportion of unplanned births, and will have lower fertility
than wives who have a traditional orienta-~
tion. Beyond this, our interest lies in interpreting some of the observed results of the
tests of this hypothesis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data on which the present study is based
were obtained from a project on family

formation and values conducted in Lexington, Kentucky, during the spring of
1968 (see Stokes, 1970; Clifford, 1969).
A 20 per cent sample of women was drawn
by a systematic procedure from birth registration records. The population sampled
was defined as resident white nonfarm females who had a legitimate live birth in
Fayette County, Kentucky, during the period January 1, 1967, to December 31, 1967.
This procedure yielded a primary list of
500 potential respondents. This list was
further reduced by excluding all couples
in which the husband and wife were no
longer living together, students, the pretest
sample, and couples in which the wife was
foreign-born. These exclusions resulted in
the elimination of ninety-seven couples.

Of the 403 eligible respondents, 275 were
interviewed, a completion rate of 68 per
cent. Out-of-town moves accounted for the
largest number of missing interviews. The
remainder could not be located after repeated call-backs. The effective sample size
was further reduced by the elimination of
Roman Catholics, because meaningful religious comparisons could not be made due
to the paucity of cases. Thus, the analysis
is based on the responses of 240 resident
white Protestant nonfarm females.

A few points regarding the sample design
should be made. Since all respondents in
the sample had at least one child, observed
differences in fertility are not due to differences in fecundity of the groups. Moreover,
group comparisons dealing with the fertility
behavior variables are very conservative
tests of the model. Women who were
fecund, who did not want children, and who
successfully prevented conception, are excluded from the sample. Consequently,
group differences may be understated as a
result of omitting these fecund women with
successful planning.

Standard information was gathered on
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

188

the reproductive behavior of each respondent, including items on number of live
births, the number of children expected
when childbearing was completed, and birth
control effectiveness. In order to control
for the effects of differential exposure, the
measure of fertility was the average number of live births per woman-year married.
In this instance, age is controlled indirectly. Birth control effectiveness was
assessed by determining the planned-unplanned status of pregnancies based on the
classification scheme developed in the
Growth of American Families studies
(Freedman et al., 1959, pp. 57-99; Whelpton et al., 1966, pp. 221-274).

Only pregnancies resulting in live births
were considered. First, these births are more
easily and accurately recalled. Second, information available indicates that interview data on miscarriages are highly unreliable (Westoff et al., 1963, pp. 264-265).
Third, the miscarriage may be self-induced
and thus a type of contraception in itself.
Finally, current pregnancies were excluded.

A battery of items for each of the five
value orientations was developed to tap
a modern versus a traditional orientation.
The response format consisted of a fourpoint continuum from strongly agree to
strongly disagree.2 Five representative
statements from each measure follow, with
the modern response in parentheses.

Nature orientation. Children should
be taught not to expect much out of life so
they won’t be disappointed. (Disagree.)

Time orientation. Nowadays a person who plans does not really know how to
enjoy the present. ( Disagree.)

Relational orientation. When you
are in trouble, only kin can be depended
upon to help out. (Disagree. )

For the purpose of this study, the scales
were trichotomized on the basis of the frequency distribution of scores.

 

RESULTS

VALUE ORIENTATIONS AND EXPECTED
FAMILY SIZE

All wives were asked a question concerning the total number of children they actually expected to have, This question is believed to provide a much more realistic
indicator of size of completed family than a
question on the number of children wanted
or any other measure of attitudes toward
family size.

The hypothesis that wives who have a
modern orientation will expect fewer children than wives who have a traditional
orientation is upheld for two of the value
orientations—nature and_ relational—as
seen from the data in Table 2. The differences in the mean number of children expected by modern and traditional nature
and relational orientations are significant
at the 0.01 level.

For the nature orientation, there appears
to be no difference in expectations between
modern and intermediate wives. In the case
of the relational orientation, the intermediate group expects a significantly larger
number of children on the average than the
modern group. The correlations of nature
and relational orientations with expectations are consistent with the hypothesis,
0.18 and 0.12 respectively.

In order to provide some idea of the
strength of the relationships between value
orientations and fertility behavior, we present product-moment correlation coefficients. The data were coded so that a high
score represents a traditional orientation
and a low score, a modern orientation, The

measures of value orientations probably do
not exceed ordinal level of measurement,
in which a nonparametric measure of association would be more appropriate. However, rather than use a less reliable measure, we opted to use the more powerful
technique of product-moment correlation
even though one of the assumptions might
be violated.®

While the nature and relational orientations are closely related to mean expected
family size, and in the hypothesized direction, the measures of time, activity, and
sex do not provide similar results. In fact,
the time and activity data generally indicate a direct reversal of the hypothesis.

3 There is substantial disagreement among researchers over the amount of error that this procedure introduces in the interpretation of the
statistic. For a view supporting the violation of
the assumption, see Labovitz, 1967, pp. 151~160.

VALUE ORIENTATIONS AND BIRTH
CONTROL EFFECTIVENESS

Thus far in the analysis, the only dependent variable considered has been the mean
number of children expected by the wives.
Of equal if not greater significance is the
extent to which the couple has evidenced
control over conception. Many studies in
the United States have demonstrated that
there are relatively minor variations in the
proportion of couples who have used or will ©
use contraception. The use or prospective
use of contraception is nearly universal
among fecund couples, and there are strong
attitudes to support this practice. However,
it should be remembered that attempts to

use contraception are not invariably successful. Many couples fail to control their
fertility satisfactorily as indicated by their
having more children than they wanted,
by their having children sooner than they
wanted, or both.

The data presented in Table 3 show the

The traditional groups exhibit the least

One might argue that these differences

relation between the various value orientations and birth control effectiveness. It appears that the nature, relational, and sex
orientations discriminate between modern
and traditional groups with respect to birth
control effectiveness as predicted. The proportions of unplanned births for the modern and intermediate groups are quite similar, but are in the expected direction with

essentially the same length of time. Had
the length of exposure been significantly
different, the observed differences might
well have been affected. Nevertheless, it is
necessary to entertain the possibility that

was computed using total unplanned births rather
than proportion of all live births that were unplanned. Although the two variables are not identical, they yield similar results; that is, the mean
numbers of unplanned births follow the same
directional pattern as proportion of live births
that were unplanned.

some of the observed variation might be
attributable to this variable.

The measure of time and activity orientations deviate somewhat from the general
pattern set above. With respect to the time
orientation, there is virtually no difference
between the modern group and the traditional group, and the small difference which
does exist is in the wrong direction. Another interesting point is that the intermediate group has the largest proportion
of unplanned births. Because the correlation
is so low (—0.01), the hypothesis cannot
be said to be confirmed.

As for the activity orientation, the data
indicate a direct reversal of the hypothesized relationship. Those women with a
modern activity orientation are characterized by a significantly larger proportion of
unplanned births than those traditional in
activity orientation. The correlation of

hypothesized, but the value is not significantly different from zero.

VALUE ORIENTATIONS AND ACTUAL FERTILITY

The data pertaining to the hypothesis
predicting modern orientations and low
mean number of births are presented in
Table 4. Inspection of the table reveals
that the differences in the mean numbers
of births by modern and traditional orientations for the nature, time, and relational
orientations are not significant. This lack
of difference is also reflected in the low correlations of nature (0.05), time (—0.01),
and relational (—0.03) orientations with
actual fertility.

As for activity and sex orientations, the
data indicate a direct reversal of the hypothesis relating modern orientations to low
fertility. Those women modern in these
orientations are characterized by higher
fertility than their traditional counterparts. The negative correlations of activity

(—0.20) and sex (—0.15) orientations
with actual fertility provide further support for a reversal of the direction of the
hypothesis.

In summary, of the five measures of the
independent value orientations, the nature
and relational orientations provide some
support for the hypothesized relation between modern orientations and low fertility
behavior (preferences, unplanned births,
and fertility). The significance of the time
and sex orientations is questionable due to
the many inconsistencies in the data. The
relation of the activity orientation to fertility behavior is a complicated one, both
from the standpoint of what the data indicate and its interpretation. The results generally indicate a direct reversal of the hypothesis.

On the whole, the results of the analysis
are more puzzling than explanatory. They
are so diverse as to admit many alternate
interpretations.

DISCUSSION
SEX ORIENTATION

There are many inconsistencies in the
sex orientation data which makes interpretation extremely difficult. We hypothesized
that a modern sex orientation would be
associated with small family-size expectations, fertility-planning success, and a small
family size. However, the findings indicate
three different patterns: (1) sex orientation
is not related to fertility expectations, or,
at best, is weakly associated; (2) the sex
orientation scale does discriminate birth
control effectiveness as predicted; and (3)
sex orientation is associated with actual
fertility, but in the opposite direction from
that hypothesized. Apparently, where sex
is defined “traditionally” as basically evil
and is not a mutually gratifying experience, the couple is less effective in its fertility planning (Table 3). However, it is
also true that if the wife has a negative
viewpoint about sex, her family is much

Social Biology

more likely to be small than if she does
not. In other words, women who have a
modern orientation to sex have larger families than women with a traditional orientation, even though the former are more effective family planners.

Much more systematic research must be
done to untangle the intricacies of the relationship between orientations to sex and
fertility behavior. Individual feelings about
sex are extremely complex and often contradictory. Interview data of the kind collected in this study cannot be expected to
embrace the full complexity of the way
respondents view Sex.

ACTIVITY ORIENTATION

As noted earlier, the activity orientation
is related to fertility behavior, but in the
opposite direction from that hypothesized.
These negative relations contradicted expectations, since a modern activity orientation was conceived as positively associated
with fertility behavior.

On the basis of the findings presented
here, it is possible that a shift has occurred
in the value orientations of the various
soicoeconomic status groups. A study by
Kahl (1965) supports this viewpoint. He
suggests that open and frank avowal of
male values of “determination and driving
ambition,” to use the phrasing of one of
our items, is most characteristic of a person in the working class, especially one who
has achieved some occupational success
as a skilled worker without much educational preparation. It is the expressed attitude of a “striver.”

Kahl maintains that men with more education strive less openly and vigorously, but
have other values that in fact aid them to
reach a level of occupational success higher
than that of the striver. These values of the
middle and upper classes, which are more
subtle and more directly connected with
success, are possible only because the basic
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

Vol. 21, No. 2

minimum of material success is taken for
granted.

A study by Mizruchi (1964) supports
this interpretation. He says that most respondents told him that it was important
for them “to get ahead in life,” but that
it was somewhat more important to persons in the working class than to those in
the middle class. If this view is correct,
then the basic idea presented earlier must
be modified. We maintained that a modern
activity orientation is one in which there
is a preference for the kind of activity
which results in measurable accomplishments, particularly occupational success.
Apparently the modern individual is success oriented, but in more subtle ways.

It seems reasonable to assume that the
middle class modern individual has shifted
from open and frank avowal of a determination to succeed to a more relativistic orientation. He has a more qualified view of
success and therefore rejects ‘“determination and driving ambition” as central to
his value system. In the working class,
where some occupational success has been
achieved and where material success is not
taken for granted, agreement with the
simplistic imperative is more likely to
obtain. ~

It seems reasonably clear that it would
be possible to continue to utilize the measure of orientation to activity as developed,
reversing the modern-traditional positions.®
However, it would appear to be more profitable to develop more sensitive instruments
to get at the nuances of the situation rather
than just the extremes.

TIME ORIENTATION
It was hypothesized that a modern time
Orientation would be associated with low
fertility preferences, fertility-planning success, and a small family size. The results

5Such a procedure was in fact employed in a
recent study (Brown, 1970) which found that
activity items correlated negatively with nature,
relational, and time orientations in a constructed
traditionism-modernism scale.

Value Orientations and Fertility

indicate that time orientation is not directly
related to fertility behavior. Perhaps in an
economic system such as that of the United
States, which permits the spreading of costs
over a longer period of time, a future or
present orientation may not be relevant to
the issue of family planning goals and contraception because of the belief that the
consequences of having children can be
worked out.

This view does not suggest that time orientation is not relevant in explaining other
behavior. In fact, it is entirely possible
that time orientation operates through
other variables that affect fertility behavior
directly. Freedman and Coombs (1966)
found that wives who expect their husbands
to have a large income increase over the
next ten-year period expect more additional
children than others. Such wives also had
more children during a follow-up period.
Furthermore, Freedman and Coombs found
that plans to send children to college, when
backed by actual savings for this purpose,
are related to expecting fewer children and
to spacing the children more widely. It is
quite evident that a future orientation—
which has an important bearing on one’s
ability to plan and means that one looks
ahead—is related to perceived increase in
income over a ten-year period and to savings for sending children to college. Thus,
it is possible to infer that time orientation
operates through other variables which
have direct consequences for fertility behavior.

It might be tentatively concluded that
time orientation is not directly related to
fertility behavior and is not one of the elements of the constellation of modern-traditional value orientations that directly
explain variations in fertility behavior. Possible future research might reveal that the
time orientation operates through variables
which affect fertility behavior directly. If
this is actually the case, it will be necessary
to identify these intervening variables.

At this point, the above interpretations
concerning the fertility behavior effects of
independent value orientations must be
viewed as largely speculative. It is apparent
that more investigation is needed concerning the relationships between the separate

value orientations and the relationship between them and fertility behavior.
