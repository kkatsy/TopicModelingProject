ABSTRACT: Demographers often assume that interpopulation variation in birth spacing is
attributable primarily to behavioral differences (e.g., in breastfeeding, coital frequency, or
contraceptive practice), and that the contribution of physiological factors is negligible. This
assumption may be correct, but it should be tested, especially in light of recent evidence that
there may be more variation in ovarian function among human populations than was
previously believed. In this paper, we apply a stochastic model of the determinants of
fecundability (the monthly probability of conception) to endocrinological data collected among
the Gainj, a tribal population in highland Papua New Guinea. Based on previous research, the
Gainj are known to have age patterns of ovarian function that differ markedly from the Western
norms. When account is taken of the late menarche, early menopause, and long ovarian cycles
that appear to characterize Gainj women, mean apparent fecundabilty across the female
reproductive span is reduced by about 27 per cent (from 0.316 to 0.235), and the mean waiting
time to next apparent conception is increased by just over one month. Thus, despite the fact that
Gainj women differ from Western women with respect to reproductive physiology by as much
as or more than any other known population, the demographic impact of these differences
appears to be slight.

Classically, demographers interested logical materials, that fall outside the
in fertility differentials have focused scope of traditional demography. Sectheir attention on behavioral explana- ond, demographers tend to regard retions, forexample, having todo withdif- productive physiology as fixed or invariferences in contraceptive behavior, coi- ant across populations, at least net of

theme of physiological variability (Case,
1985). With reference specifically to reproductive physiology, recent research
suggests that age patterns of ovarian
function (menstrual cycle length, prevalence of anovulatory cycles, luteal adequacy, etc.) may vary widely among
contemporary human populations
(Seaton and Riad-Fahmy, 1980; Ellison
et al., 1986, 1989; Johnson et al., 1987).
To date, however, the implications of
such variation for fertility have not been
explored.

This raises the third problem: the absence of established methods for translating physiological findings into numer
ical predictions about demographic
processes. Effects of physiology on fertility involve the ill-defined, poorly
operationalized concept of “fecundity,”
the biological capacity to produce a live
birth. Unlike fertility, which is marked
by a more or less unambiguous, countable event (a live birth), fecundity is a
“potential” and is thus not only unmeasurable using standard demographic
techniques, but also difficult to model
mathematically. Fecundity can, however, be broken down into several components, each of which can be defined
precisely and, at least in principle, observed directly. Recently we have attempted to decompose fecundity into
factors that are amenable to quantitative study (Table 1). We have also begun to develop mathematical models
which specify the relationship of these
factors to fertility itself (Wood and
Weinstein, 1988; Weinstein et al.,
1990a,5; Wood, 19892).

One important measure of fecundity
is fecundability, the probability that a
couple will conceive during a month of
exposure to unprotected intercourse,

given that both members are biologically able to conceive. Obviously, fecundability is not entirely a function of
physiology, but is also affected by an important behavioral variable, coital frequency, as well as by the way in which
coitus is distributed across the female
partner’s cycle. Interpopulation differences in fecundability can be used as
measures of differences in fecundity
only if we can adjust for differences in
coital frequency. As we will show, such
an adjustment can be attained by using
appropriate mathematical models.

In this paper, our aim is to translate
recent empirical findings about variation in ovarian function into predictions
about birth spacing patterns. More precisely, we apply our models of the physiological determinants of fecundability
to endocrinological data recently obtained from women in the rural highlands of Papua New Guinea. These
women, all from a tribal group known as
the Gainj, are especially interesting for
this application, because Gainj women
differ from Western women in their age
patterns of ovarian function by as much
as or more than any other known human
population. In particular, Gainj women
experience considerably later menarche, somewhat earlier menopause, and
menstrual cycles that are about 40 per
cent longer on average than those of
Western women (Wood et al., 1985a;
Johnson et al., 1987; Wood, 1989b).
Thus, if interpopulation variation in
these physiological components ever
contributes importantly to fertility differentials, a comparison of Gainj and Western women should reveal its effects.

In performing this comparison, we
adopt a ceteris paribus approach; that is,
we assume that all characteristics, physiological as well as behavioral, of the two
groups of women are identical except for

Social Biology

the specific physiological traits known to
differ between them. Thus, the question
we pose is: How different would the
birth spacing patterns of the two groups
be if they differed only in the length of
their ovarian cycles and the age of onset
of menarche and menopause?

MATERIALS AND METHODS
THE SAMPLE

The Gainj are a group of tropical horticulturalists living in the northern
fringes of Papua New Guinea’s central
highlands. The data used here, collected
during two year-long field studies in
1977-78 and 1982-83, come from 12
Gainj villages, all in the Upper Takwi
Valley at elevations of 850-1400 meters
and centered at 144°44’ E longitude and
5°18’ S latitude. At the time of our primary census in January-April 1978, a total of 1,318 individuals (700 males and
618 females) lived in the study area at an
overall density of 24 persons/km?.

In May 1983, 129 Gainj women ages
10 to 50 were recruited into a ten-week
prospective study of ovarian function;
all but 18 of these women remained in
the study until its termination. The final
sample of 111 women who provided
complete records represents approximately 65 per cent of all females of the
relevant ages from the six communities
targeted in the study. Although this was
an availability sample rather than a true
random sample, these 111 women were
known not to differ from larger samples
of the general population with respect to
several factors which may affect or be affected by ovarian function, including anthropometric measures of nutritional
status, marital status, cumulative fertility, and prevalence of breastfeeding.
None of the 18 women who dropped out

of the study did so for reasons related to
reproductive state (e.g., learning that
they were pregnant). Age estimates
were assigned to the subjects by the
methods described by Wood et al.
(1985a).

Each subject was interviewed twice
weekly by a female fieldworker who was
well known to these women. At each interview, the subject’s menstrual diary
was updated (entries in the diary consisting of subject’s self-report of bleeding on the day of the interview and on
the two or three days since the previous
interview), and a2 ml saliva sample was
collected for future studies of ovarian
function using salivary steroid assays.
At the end of the ten-week study period,
a single 10 ml blood sample was drawn
from each subject, spun down immediately, and placed in liquid nitrogen. The
sera were later analyzed by radioimmunoassay for progesterone, estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating
hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, and prolactin (see Wood et al.,
19855, for assay details). These serum
determinations, in addition to selfreports of lactation, permit each subject
to be classified by her reproductive state

at the time of blood collection using the
criteria in Table 2. The distribution of
subjects by reproductive state is shown
in Figure 1.

PHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS
OF THE SAMPLE

Detailed analyses of these data have
been presented elsewhere (Wood et al.,
1985b; Johnson et al., 1987; Wood,
1989b); here we present brief summaries of the results.

The cumulative incidence curves of
menarche and menopause were estimated from the data in the top panel of
Figure 1 by inverse-variance weighted
probit analysis using the maximum likelihood method of Finney (1971). According to these analyses, the estimated
median ages of Gainj women at menarche and menopause are 18.4 + 1.4
years, respectively.” Although the esti
These results differ from the figures of 20.9 +
0.9 and 46.2 + 1.1 years estimated from Gainj
samples collected in 1978 and reported by Wood et
al. (1985a). In the case of menopause, the difference is not significant, but for menarche it is. We
do not, however, believe that this represents a real
secular decline in age at menarche, since the hormonal criteria used to classify women in the 1983
samples are more specific than those used earlier.
Our earlier methods could only detect onset of full

mated median age at menarche is clearly
very late by world standards, it is consistent with estimates from other parts of
highland Papua New Guinea, which as a
region shows the latest known ages of
human sexual maturation (Malcolm,
1970; Becker, 1990; Wood, 19895). In

luteal competence rather than menarche per se;
more recently we have been better able to detect
very early follicular development, thus giving us
landmarks of ovarian ontogeny more closely related to first menses. In general, luteal competence
follows first menses by about 1.0-1.5 years, consistent with the estimates from both 1978 and 1983.

contrast, while the estimated median
age of Gainj] women at menopause is
somewhat lower than in U.S. women, it
falls well within the range of values reported for other rural Third World populations (Rahman and Menken, 1990).
The cumulative incidence curves of
menarche and menopause in both Gainj
and U.S. women are shown in Figure 2.

the time of the blood draw, i.e., who
showed hormonal signs of being in either the follicular or the luteal phase of
an ovarian cycle (Fig. 1., bottom
panel).? To correct for the bimodal age
distribution of cycling subjects (a distribution which reflects the fact that virtually all married Gainj women of midreproductive age are pregnant and/or
lactating at any given time), the Gainj
sample was compared with a synthetic
sample of U.S. women drawn from the
data of Treloar et al. (1967) and
matched with the Gainj sample for
gynecological age (see Johnson et al.,
1987, for details). Figure 3 shows
Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival
functions for these two samples; the two
curves are significantly different (logrank test statistic = 34.8, p < 0.0001).
Estimates of median cycle length were
obtained from the regression lines in
Figure 3 and are given in Table 3. It appears that Gainj cycles are approximately 40 per cent longer on average
than those of Western women.

There are several reasons to interpret
these results with caution. Subjects’
ages are not known, but rather estimated indirectly. The incidence curves
for menarche and menopause are estimated entirely from cross-sectional data
and thus may not represent any actual
cohort if the true underlying curves have
changed recently. And the analysis of

3We used a subsample of cycling women for
this analysis for several reasons. First, the records
of two subjects were known to be unreliable. In addition, all women who were married at the time of
the study were excluded because (1) their records
may have been contaminated by “silent pregnancies” associated with early fetal loss, which could
have caused an apparent lengthening of their cycles, and (2) if they were exposed to the risk of conception but did not conceive during the study period, this might itself be attributable to ovarian
dysfunction, so that their inclusion could have introduced selectivity bias.

Social Biology

cycle length is based on self-reports of
menstrual bleeding, the reliability of
which is inherently difficult to gauge.*
These limitations notwithstanding, it
appears, based on present evidence,
that Gainj women differ markedly from
Western women with respect to their
age patterns of ovarian physiology. In
particular, Western women have one of
the earliest known average ages at onset
of menarche, while Gainj women have
one of the latest; Gain} women also appear to have substantially longer ovarian cycles than Western women. We
know of no other human populations
that differ as markedly in reproductive
physiology, although some populations,
for example, the Efe and Lese of Zaire,
show extreme differences from Western
women in features such as proportion of
cycles anovulatory which we have not
yet evaluated among the Gainj (Ellison
et al., 1986, 1989). Added to these extreme differences is a much smaller difference between Gainj and Western
women in age at menopause.

What effect do these differences have
on fertility? If Gain) and Western
women were identical with respect to
everything except their age patterns of
ovarian function, how much difference
in the timing of births would we expect
to observe? Needless to say, this question is impossible to answer based solely
on empirical observations, since the two
populations differ dramatically with respect to many factors affecting fertility,
including breastfeeding, contraceptive
use, prevalence of induced abortion,
and perhaps coital frequency. We require a mathematical model that will allow us to adjust for these other differences.

‘Eventually we will have objective verification
of the menstrual records in the form of concurrent
salivary steroid profiles.

A MODEL OF AGE-SPECIFIC
FECUNDABILITY

Ovarian function affects the timing of
births by influencing fecundability,
which in turn determines an important
component of every birth interval, the
fecund waiting time to conception. Fecundability is affected by several physiological factors (Table 1), as well as by coital behavior. Since we cannot reliably
detect pregnancies which terminate during the earliest stages of gestation, the
apparent value of fecundability, the
value which we can actually estimate, is
also affected to some degree by subclinical fetal loss.

In our model of fecundability, we attempt to incorporate all these effects.
Since a full description of the model appears elsewhere (Wood and Weinstein,
1988), we summarize it briefly here.
Throughout we distinguish apparent fecundability, the monthly probability of a
conception that survives long enough to
produce a diagnosable pregnancy, from
total fecundability, the monthly probability of a conception regardless of outcome. All parameters of the model are
allowed to vary by female’s age, although for simplicity the following presentation pertains only to one age during the reproductive span.

For the age in question, let c be the
event that conception occurs in one
ovarian cycle of exposure to unprotected intercourse. Then

Pr(c) =

x Pr(c|N = n)Pr(N =n)
n=0 (1)

where N is the number of acts of unprotected intercourse per cycle. This equation partitions the probability of conception into two independent components:
a “behavioral” component, Pr(N=n),

Social Biology

and a “physiological” component, Pr
(c\N = n). The physiological component can be further partitioned as

Pr(c,N =n) = % Priel =i) (2)
i=0
x Pr = iio,N = n)Pr(o)

where o is the event that a cycle is ovulatory and J is the number of times that intercourse occurs during one fertile period. If acts of intercourse are
independent in occurrence, then

Pr(I = io,N =n) =

(9) (FIC) (1-FICY™,

i= 0,...,7 (3)

where Fis the length of the fertile period
and Cis total cycle length (both in days).
The probability of conception can
now be found as follows. Let p,{i) be the
conditional probability that exactly 7
days with at least one act of intercourse

occur in the fertile period given that J =
i. Then

pli) = CV EDI ETS,
r=1,,...,F. (4)
If ais the probability that conception oc
curs from a single day of intercourse
during the fertile period, then

F
Pr(cil = i) = X{pi)
r=1
x [1-(1-a)']}, i> 0 (5)
and Pr(c'll = 0) = 0.

We specify the behavioral component of Eq. (1), first, by treating the
number of acts of intercourse per cycle
as a Poisson random variable, such that

Pr(N = n) = [exp(-mC) « (mC)")/n!,
n = 0,1,2,... (6)

where m is the mean daily probability of

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 37, No. 1~2

intercourse. Next, we allow m to decline
as a function of marital duration: at maternal age x,

m =53n(x-y)g(y)dy,/ §.%9(y)dy, y a

where g(y) is the probability density of
women marrying at age y, and A(-) is an
empirically-derived function describing
the decline in the daily coital rate with
marital duration (see Wood and Weinstein, 1988, for details). The function
g(y) is calculated from the CoaleMcNeil marriage model (Coale and
McNeil, 1972); more specifically, we use
a reparameterization of the model by
Rodriquez and Trussell (1980), which
allows the model to be fully specified by
the mean and variance in age of women
at first marriage. The function h (-) was
estimated from data on U.S. couples
collected by J. R. Udry and reported by
James (1983).

In an alternative specification of the
behavioral component that we refer to
as maximal exposure, we assume that
unprotected intercourse occurs every
single day of the fertile period (equivalent to assuming that it occurs every cycle day). Thus, maximal exposure represents a situation in which coital
frequency is held constant at this maximum possible level.

The probability of conception per cycle is found by combining the behavioral
and physiological components; this
probability can be converted into the
probability of conception per month,
i.e., total fecundability, as shown by
Wood and Weinstein (1988). Assuming
that fecundability is homogeneous
among women, apparent fecundability
(f.*) is then related to total fecundability

(f*) as:
fa" = f*C-s)l( + f*gs)

Highland Papua New Guinea 35

where s is the probability of subclinical
fetal loss per conception, and g is the duration of the nonsusceptible period associated with each subclinical loss.

Finally, let 8 be the probability that a
woman at the age in question is both
postmenarcheal and premenopausal.
Total and apparent fecundability, adjusting for menarche and menopause,
are now

f= Bf" and f, = Bf." (9)

respectively.

CHOICE OF VALUES FOR THE
MODEL PARAMETERS

In order to compare Gainj and Western women using this model, we hold all
physiological and behavioral parameters equal in the two populations, except
for cycle length and the proportion of
women at each age who are postmenarcheal and premenopausal. At the same
time, we allow for age-specific variation
in the parameters within each population. In Western women, mean cycle
length at each age is taken from Treloar
et al. (1967); for Gainj women, these
same values are multiplied by 1.4, as
suggested by the survival analysis summarized in Figure 3. The cumulative incidence curves for menarche and menopause, used to estimate the value of B at
each age, are those shown in Figure 2.
Estimates of the probability that a cycle
at each age is ovulatory are taken from
Vollman (1977). The expected probability of subclinical fetal loss at each maternal age follows the curve shown in Figure 4, which we have estimated from
data on nine populations in which induced abortion is not a competing risk
(Wood and Weinstein, 1988). The level
of this curve corresponding to maternal

age 23 has been adjusted upward to 0.3,
consistent with recent estimates based
on assays of human chorionic gonadotropin (Wilcox et al., 1988).5 The rest of
the curve is then allowed to vary in paralel with the curve in Figure 4. On the basis of the same studies, the time added
by subclinical fetal loss has been set to
0.26 months (Wilcox et al., 1988). In accordance with Royston’s (1982) analysis, the length of the fertile period is set
at four days and the probability of conception from an insemination in the fertile period is set at 0.6, the average daily
probability of conception over the fertile period as a whole, adjusted to the
mean age of his sample.

In our model, the behavioral component of fecundability is determined by
the density function of age at first marriage, which is turn affects coital frequency via its relation to marital duration. In order to hold the behavioral
component constant, we set both the
Gain} and Western marriage pattern
equal to the curve estimated from the
Gainj data (Figure 5). From this curve,
the estimated mean and variance in age
at first marriage (in years) are 21.6 and
8.2, respectively.

‘The value 0.3 is slightly higher than the estimate of Wilcox et al. (1988), reflecting the fact that
they used a somewhat conservative criterion for
identifying a loss and that they missed very early
losses which preceded the excretion of detectable
levels of hCG in urine. Other studies have suggested substantially higher probabilities of subclinical loss, including studies based on hCG (Miller et
al., 1980; Edmonds et al., 1982) and early pregnancy factor (Rolfe, 1982). It is clear, however,
that early pregnancy factor entails a large number
of false positive diagnoses of pregnancy, as may
hCG unless an assay system is used which minimizes cross-reactivity with luteinizing hormone
(Grudzinskas and Nysenbaum, 1985; Wilcox et
al., 1985). We have chosen to base our estimate on
the work of Wilcox et al. (1988) because their assay
system is the most sensitive and specific hCG assay
currently available.

RESULTS

Figure 6 compares the age pattern of
fecundability in Gain] and Western
women under maximal exposure when
cycle length alone differs between the
two populations. The 40 per cent increase in cycle length among Gainj
women reduces fecundability at each
age by lowering the number of fertile
days expected to fall within a fixed 30day period. Since the difference in cycle
length is assumed to be multiplicative so
that Gainj cycles at each age are assumed to be 40 per cent longer than
Western cycles, the absolute difference
in fecundability is greatest at those ages
characterized by long cycles, i.e., at
early and late reproductive ages. This
result may be an artifact of the way in
which we have modeled the difference in
cycle length, although not of the way in
which cycle length enters into the basic
model. At any rate, between ages 20
and 45, longer cycles reduce both total
and apparent fecundability by about 20
per cent on average.

As might be expected, adding in the
difference in age patterns of menarche
and menopause has an effect only at extreme reproductive ages (Figure 7). In
comparison with Western women,
Gainj women now experience a period
of about five years before the earliest
age of menarche when fecundability is
zero, and a similar period of about two
years after the latest age at menopause.
Postmenarcheal fecundability in the
Gainj does not reach half its adult value
until after age 20, that is, until about the
average age at first marriage. Consistent
with this finding, we have observed an
unexpectedly long interval between
marriage and first birth among the Gainj
(Wood et al., 1985a; Wood, 19895), an
interval which is typically quite short in

assumption that apparent fecundability is homogeneous

observed in the Gainj. The principal difference between this figure and the preceding ones is that fecundability is lower
at all ages in both populations, reflecting
the difference between maximal exposure and less frequent intercourse.

In all these comparisons, the fecundability of Gain} women appears to be
about 20-35 per cent lower than that of

Western women at most ages. Superficially, this may seem like an important
difference—and from a purely physiological point of view it may well be—but
it appears to have a small demographic
impact. Assuming that women in each
population are homogeneous in fecundability, then the mean waiting time to
next recognizable conception is simply

40 Johnson et al.

the inverse of apparent fecundability
(Sheps, 1964).° Table 4 lists the predicted mean waiting items of Gainj and
Western women at various ages during
the reproductive span. While, on average, the apparent fecundability of Gainj
women is about 27 per cent lower than
that of their Western counterparts
(0.235 versus 0.323), this difference
translates into an increase of barely over
a month in the waiting time to a recognizable conception and thus in birth intervals in general.

DISCUSSION

Our analyses suggest that the extreme physiological patterns observed
in Gain} women are expected to have
only a minimal effect on the distribution
of birth intervals in this population.
Thus, their demographic impact appears to be slight. This is not to say,
however, that these patterns are not interesting in their own right from a more
purely physiological point of view; indeed, we are currently carrying out studies of the hormonal and metabolic correlates of ovarian function in Gainj
women. We merely suggest that, froma
narrowly demographic point of view,
the long cycles, late menarche, and early
menopause reported for the Gain are
of minor importance. This conclusion is
consistent with our earlier findings that
behavioral factors such as nursing frequency and age patterns of marriage are
the dominant factors limiting Gain] fertility (Wood et al., 1985a,b; Wood,
1989b).

‘If apparent fecundability varies among couples, then the mean waiting time is the inverse of the
harmonic mean apparent fecundability (Wood,
19892). In practical terms, however, heterogeneous fecundability changes the distribution of
waiting times to next recognizable conception only
slightly (see Weinstein et al., 19905).

Social Biology

It is important to point out, however,
that this comparison of Gainj and Western women is conservative, in that it is
based solely on those physiological differences for which we now have direct
evidence. We have ignored any possible
difference in fetal loss, proportion of cycles ovulatory, and duration of adolescent and premenopausal subfecundity,
deliberately setting these factors equal
in both sets of women. It is thus possible
that we have underestimated the total
impact of physiological differences between the two groups.

This is especially true if recent findings about the relationship between age
at menarche and duration of adolescent
subfecundity are relevant to this comparison. It is well known that menarche
is normally followed by a period during
which cycles are variable in length and
prone to be anovulatory (Brown et al.,
1978; Billewicz et al., 1980; Metcalf and
MacKenzie, 1980). In a study of 200
Finnish school girls, Apter and Vihko
(1983) found a significant positive correlation between age at menarche and
time from menarche until half of all cycles were ovulatory (with ovulation indicated by the presence of a midcycle LH/
FSH surge and a luteal phase rise in
progesterone). Thus, girls with late
menarche also experienced prolonged
adolescent subfecundity. Note that this
is a finding about within-population variability. If the same holds true for differences between populations, then Gainj
women, with their extremely late menarche, might also be expected to have
extremely long adolescent subfecundity, thus amplifying the difference between Gainj and Western women. To
date, however, nothing is known about
the correlation between menarcheal age
and adolescent subfecundity across populations; in addition, Apter and Vihko’s

results have not been replicated in other
studies (e.g., MacMahon et al., 1982).
Once all the saliva samples collected
among the Gainj have been assayed for
ovarian steroids, we should be able to
address this question directly.

Another reason that the comparison
presented here is conservative has to do
with the quality of long cycles such as
those observed among the Gainj. Our
model assumes that long cycles affect fecundability only by decreasing the number of fertile days expected to fall within
a single month, but that long and short
cycles are otherwise functionally equivalent. It is possible, however, that long
cycles may differ functionally from short
cycles. For example, long cycles may actually represent multiple anovulatory
cycles, may be caused by defects in follicular development, or may be associated with short or otherwise inadequate
luteal phases (Lenton et al., 1984;
Glass, 1986). The first of these three
possibilities would have precisely the effect we have already built into our
model: the ratio of fertile to nonfertile
days within a month would be reduced.
The second and third possibilities, however, would have additional effects on
apparent fecundability. Follicular defects may result in ova that cannot be
fertilized, while luteal defects may result
in failure of implantation and thus an elevated risk of subclinical fetal loss
(Niswender and Nett, 1988). Once
again, when all the saliva samples we
collected have been assayed for ovarian
steroids, we will be able to assess the
quality of Gainj cycles more directly.

Finally, it is important to note that
our analysis is not a complete assessment of Gainj fecundability. Because of
the near-impossibility of obtaining high
quality prospective data on waiting
times to conception in this sort of field

Highland Papua New Guinea 41

setting, we have not attempted to estimate Gainj fecundablity in the usual, direct manner. Rather, we have “estimated” it indirectly using a model of the
determinants of fecundability, a method
which requires us to take certain important factors for granted. In particular,
we make assumptions about coital behavior that may not be correct in the
Gainj case. While the function g(y) in
Eq. (7) was fit directly to data on the
Gainj, the function h (-), which describes the decline in coital frequency
with marital duration, is based strictly
on data pertaining to U.S. couples.
While it is premature to make strong
claims about the universality of this effect of marital duration on coital frequency, it does appear to be widespread
(see, for example, Ruzicka and Bhatia,
1982). However, there is ethnographic
evidence suggesting that coital rates
may be markedly lower in highland New
Guinea at all marital durations than in
other parts of the world. For example, in
many highland societies, including the
Gain], there are strong beliefs about the
polluting or debilitating effects of sexual
intercourse, requiring that intercourse
occur in the forest away from house sites
and gardens (Brown, 1978). Unfortunately, we do not have reliable data on
coital frequency from the Gainj or from
any other population in highland New
Guinea, but one might predict that coital frequency in such groups is low. Until
we have direct evidence about coital frequency among the Gainj, however, we
will not be able to make a full assessment of Gainj fecundability, even by
our indirect methods.

These limitations aside, it remains
striking how little effect the known differences in reproductive physiology between Gainj and U.S. women seem to
have on birth intervals. A substantial re

duction in apparent fecundability (on
the order of 25-30 per cent) translates
into a trivial increase in expected birth
intervals (about one month). In part,
this finding simply reflects the relationship between f, when f, ranges between
zero and one. This relationship is, of
course, curvilinear, with small changes
in f, inducing large changes in 1/f, when
fa is itself small, but negligible changes
when f, is intermediate or high. Perturbing f, when it is in the neighborhood of
0.3 or 0.4 simply produces smaller
changes in the waiting time to conception (and thus in birth intervals) than
equal perturbations to an f, of 0.1 or
lower. In addition, however, we know
from sensitivity tests of our models that
fecundability itself is less responsive to
changes in cycle length and age at men

arche or menopause than it is to changes
in other parameters such as the level of
fetal loss and the proportion of anovulatory cycles (Wood and Weinstein,
1988). Thus the very factors we have left
out of the comparison (or rather set
equal in the two populations) may have
the largest potential impact on fecundability. Our conclusion, that known interpopulation differences in reproductive
physiology do not have important effects on birth spacing, must therefore remain provisional.
