ABSTRACT: This paper investigates the effects of maternal demographic characteristics and
social and economic statuses on infant mortality in rural Colombia. Demographic
characteristics include the age of the mother, parity and length of preceding interbirth interval,
and sex of infant. Measures of women’s status at the time of birth include education, wage labor
and occupation, economic stratum, place of residence, and whether the mother is living with a
husband. The life history data for the study (involving 4,928 births) were collected in 1986 from
a representative sample of two cohorts of women resident in rural central Colombia. Overall
differentials in infant mortality by measures of women’s status are small and are in good part
associated with the differing reproductive behaviors of the women and variations in
breastfeeding practices. The sharp declines in infant mortality recorded in rural Colombia in
recent years appear less related to improved status of women than to reductions in fertility that
enhance infant survivorship and to public health interventions shared by all segments of the

population.

A key element in the demographic
transition of any modernizing society is
the reduction in infant mortality. Lowered infant death is a highly visible outcome of the improved life chances associated with social and economic
development, and improved health care
delivery (Preston, 1980; Shin, 1975).
Significant reductions in infant death
permit parents to invest more emotional
and financial resources in their newborn
children and enable parents to think
about planning their family size with
greater certainty (Preston, 1978; Taylor

et al., 1976). Reductions in fertility of
ten are associated, in turn, with longer
birth intervals and fewer high parity
births, changes which further reduce infant mortality (Chen, 1983).

During this demographic transition,
societies often witness a revolution in

188

the social and economic lives of women.
In Colombia, the society we examine in
this paper, these changes in demographic behaviors and the lives of
women have had major consequences
on the lives of the rural population as
well as on urban residents (Florez et al.,
1987). Economic divisions in the rural
society are important, with the poorest
families living in isolated regions without basic public services. While a majority of women are living with a husband
when their children are born, a substantial proportion are single mothers who
lack access to the economic and social
support a husband can provide. The education of these rural women has increased in recent cohorts, although few
go beyond primary school. While most
mothers do not engage in paid labor at
the time they give birth, a substantial

minority do continue such work, often
under poor conditions and for low
wages.

Research demonstrates that the risks
of infant mortality are determined
largely by birth weight, nutrition, incidence of infection and accidents, and
the quality of health care. Birth weight
depends mainly on the length of birth intervals and the mother’s nutritional status. The infant’s nutrition depends
mainly on the intensity and duration of
breastfeeding, and on supplements or
replacements used in place of breastmilk. The incidence of infections and accidents depends on infant hygiene and
quality of care. Health care is determined by the availability and utilization
of preventive and curative medical services (Chen, 1983),

The revolution in women’s lives has
implications for infant survivorship, because of the effects of women’s social
and economic characteristics on these
determinants of infant well-being (Mason, 1984). Factors such as the education of women and the opportunity costs
of childbearing promote contraceptive
use which lengthens birth intervals
(Cochrane, 1983; Wolfers and Scrimshaw, 1975). It has also been hypothesized that more educated mothers are
less influenced by traditional practices
inimical to modern health care and are
more capable of dealing with modern institutions, especially health services
(Schultz, 1980). Access to and use of
prenatal and postnatal medical care is of
critical importance (Smucker et al.,
1980; Haines and Avery, 1978; Orubuloye and Caldwell, 1975; Puffer and Serrano, 1973). Furthermore, it has been
argued that more educated mothers are
able to alter the traditional balance of
family relations to favor the allocation

 

Infant Mortality 189

of a greater share of resources to their
children (Caldwell, 1979). Thus, enhanced women’s autonomy is hypothesized to reduce infant mortality (Mason,
1984; Dyson and Moore, 1983).

Women’s employment has contradictory influences on infant mortality.
Women’s work may be associated with
enhanced individual autonomy and improved family incomes, both of which
are thought to be beneficial for infant
survival. On the other hand, women’s
work in developing nations often involves long hours and poor working
conditions which lessen the ability of
mothers to care for their children. Restrictions on their ability to breastfeed
may be critical in this regard (Hogan and
Kertzer, 1986; Hobcraft et al., 1984).

These measures of the social and economic situations of women are indicative of the status of women, with effects,
in turn, on the survival chances of their
children. In this paper we investigate the
magnitude of these effects on infant
mortality in rural Colombia. We first
turn to a description of the population
and place this study of individual behaviors in the larger context of the demographic transition in Colombia. After
describing our data and methods, we
present overall differentials in infant
mortality. We then attempt to assess the
extent to which the dimensions of women’s status influence infant survivorship
taking into account their impacts on reproductive behaviors, and on breastfeeding.

INFANT MORTALITY DIFFERENTIALS IN
RURAL COLOMBIA

During the last five decades both urban and rural Colombia have been experiencing the demographic. transition
process. The process started at the end

190 Florez and Hogan

of the 1930’s with improvements in mortality conditions. Later, by the beginning of the 1960’s, fertility began to decline. The crude death rate fell from
30.5 in 1938 to 9.0 in 1978. Life expectancy rose from 44 years in 1938 to 61
years in 1978 and to 67 years in 1985.
The crude birth rate decreased from
45.2 at the end of the 1950’s to 28.9 in
1980. At the same time, the total fertility
rate decreased from 7.0 in 1960-64 to
4.6 in 1972-73 and to 3.6 in 1978, a reduction of almost 50 per cent in less than
20 years. Associated with this demographic process have been government
policies in health and education, the activities of the private sector oriented toward providing family planning services, and structural changes related to
modernization (Florez et al., 1987; Banguero, 1983).

As part of this demographic transition, Colombia has experienced considerable declines in infant mortality in
both urban and rural areas. Infant mortality rates nationally decreased from
200 in 1938 to 61 in 1978 and to 43 in
1985 (Ordonez, 1988). Improvements in
the educational levels of the population,
the extensive countrywide health campaigns oriented to the prevention of illness during the 1950’s and the 1960’s,
and the national children’s immunization campaigns supported by the government during the 1970’s and the
1980’s are among the factors generally
believed to have produced the infant
mortality decline.

Despite these dramatic declines in infant mortality, substantial regional, demographic, and socioeconomic differentials in infant mortality levels exist in
Colombia. Direct estimates from the
1976 Colombian World Fertility Survey
(WFS) indicate that infant mortality is
very high when the mother is quite

 

Social Biology

young, reaches its lowest level for mothers around the ages of 25 to 30, and then
increases steadily with age of mother
(Somoza, 1980). At the same time, Somoza found that first births have experienced a lower mortality than births of
any other order. Given that younger
women tend to have births of first order,
he explained this apparent contradiction
by the fact that a large majority of first
births occur at ages 20—29 where there is
a clear mortality differential by birth order, with first births experiencing lower
mortality. Somoza’s (1980) results also
indicate that urban infant mortality is
lower than rural mortality, and that the
highest infant mortality is found in the
Pacific region and the lowest in the
Oriental-Bogota region. (In all studies
based on the WES data, socioeconomic
and residential characteristics refer to
the time of the survey and not to the
time when the child was born. Colombia
is divided into five geographical regions:
Pacific, Atlantic, Central, Oriental, and
Bogota. However, with the WFS data, it
was not possible to study Bogota separately because of small sample sizes.) At
the same time Somoza (1980) shows that

the mortality of children of women with

lower education (less than three years of
schooling) is higher than the mortality of
the children of mothers with higher
schooling (three or more years of
schooling).

A multivariate analysis done with
World Fertility Survey (WFS) data for
28 countries suggest that there are important variations in the effects of maternal education, work status, and place
of residence on infant mortality (Hobcraft, 1984). In order to have comparable results between countries, the research used a standard grouping of
education by years of schooling into
those with 0, 1-3, 4-6 and 7+ years of
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

education. In the case of mother’s work
status, information from WFS surveys is
only available for work status since marriage, with no detail on timing of such
work. Hobcraft distinguished three categories, namely, those who have not
worked, those who have worked for
their immediate family, and those who
have worked for others. In the specific
case of Colombia, the higher the mother’s level of education the higher the
children’s chances of survival. The work
status of the mother and place of residence had no effect on infant mortality.
However, since the mother’s socioeconomic characteristics refer to the date of
the survey rather than to the time of the
birth, the results, in particular those for
work status and place of residence, may
be subject to error. Indirect calculations
using data from the 1985 Colombian
population census indicate that there
still is a significant urban/rural differential in infant mortality (Ordonez, 1988).
The infant mortality rate for the country
as a whole was estimated as 42, with a
rate of 38 in urban areas and 53 in rural
areas.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SuRVEY DESIGN

This analysis utilizes data from the
Colombian Longitudinal Rural Survey
conducted between October and November 1986 by the Center of Studies in
Economic Development of Los Andes
University, Bogota, Colombia. The
main purpose of that survey was to
gather life history data on demographic
and socioeconomic variables for two cohorts of women representing the behavior before and after the sharp decline in
fertility experienced by the country during the last three decades. Women born

Infant Mortality 191

in 1937-46 were selected to represent
women who were in their reproductive
ages at the beginning of the 1960’s when
fertility began to decline, and women
born in 1955-61 were selected to represent those women who were in their reproductive ages in the 1980’s after the
sharp decline in fertility. Thus, these
two cohorts were 40-49 and 25-31 years
of age, respectively, in 1986 when the
fieldwork was done.

The area of study was defined as the
rural zones of Cundinamarca and Boyaca States located in the higher areas of
the Andina region (see Figure 1). This
region has similar geographical and cultural patterns to Bogota, the capital and
biggest city of the country. It is located
between the medium and the higher
thermic floors and 1500 meters above
sea level. These two states account for
almost 80 per cent of the total migrants
to Bogota. These rural areas have, in
general, good accessibility to urban areas. The average distance for these rural
areas to the nearest county seat with a
commercial center and health center is
close to 7 kilometers. Typically, the
journey must be done walking. According to the 1985 census, only 30 per cent
of all rural areas in Colombia have a safe
supply of water, and 41 per cent have
electrical services. The areas under
study have relatively better access to
these facilities, but even so only about
half of them have water and electrical
services. These rural areas also have
slightly higher educational levels than
the average for rural Colombia. The illiteracy rate for the study area is 22 per
cent, whereas for the rural areas of the
whole country, according to the 1985
census, illiteracy is 30 per cent. The delimited rural area has relatively homogeneous characteristics of economic
production and land tenancy relations:

townships (disperse rural area and head

Development Program (DRI). (The
DRI program is sponsored by the Department of Agriculture, which by
credit programs, infrastructure investments, and technical assistance, promotes higher production by improving
conditions in the field economic units.
Around 93 per cent of the Cundinamarca and Boyaca townships are covered by the DRI program.) The sample

design was probabilistic with equal
probabilities for all the elements of the
population (that is, it is self-weighting).
The sample was a two-stage one. In the
first stage, townships were selected, and
in the second one, sample dwelling units
were selected. The target sample size of
600 women in each cohort led to visits to
3,537 households in 360 conglomerates,
of which 3,284 were occupied, and in
3,059 was it possible to get information
(93.1 per cent coverage). These households included 570 women from the
1955-61 cohort and 638 from the 193746 cohort. Of these sample women, 93.5
per cent in the 1955-61 cohort and 90.6
per cent in the 1937-46 cohort agreed to
be interviewed, giving a total of 533 and
578 completed interviews respectively.

The survey made use of three instruments to obtain data, one for the rural
conglomerate, the household, and the
woman’s life history. The community
questionnaire gathered information
about isolation, altitude above sea level,
and existence of community services.
The household questionnaire gathered
information on household typology,
household quality, and household characteristics as a consumption unit.

Three socioeconomic strata were
defined according to relative conditions
of the household (quality), tenancy relations, economic support source, isolation, Community services access, and
community organization. The low stratum included one-third of the households which had the lowest infrastructure and the most precarious production
conditions. The middle stratum included the next third of the households,
and the upper stratum included the top
one-third of the households classified on
these aspects of well-being. Women
were assigned membership in the socioeconomic strata according to the household to which they belonged.

 

Infant Mortality 193

The woman’s questionnaire gathered
two sets of information, one on the
woman’s characteristics at the moment
of the interview and another on her life
history. The life history tells about the
sequence of events in a woman’s life on
the following variables: residence, education, paid work, non-paid work
(housework consumption and/or nonagricultural family type activities), cohabitation, fertility, and family planning. This part was structured as a
matrix in which rows corresponded to
the woman’s age or the dates (calendar
years) and the columns, grouped by
headings or subjects, corresponded to
the measured variables. For each variable, each entry, suspension, or drop-out
was registered at the corresponding age
with complementary information about
characteristics of the events. This life
history matrix design allowed checks for
internal consistency of the data and facilitated accuracy in the recall of the
ages of occurrence of the different
events. Specifically, the life history matrix was filled by variables (columns),
and as each history variable was filled in,
it was checked against other life domains for which information had already been provided.

The woman’s life history matrix was
the main source for the infant mortality
data used in this analysis. The retrospective data on fertility included a complete
life history for each one of the woman’s
children born alive, comprising information on the mother’s age at birth, and
the child’s sex, breastfeeding, survival
status, and, where relevant, age at
death. Additionally, the fertility history
also gathered information on other
pregnancies that did not result in a live
birth, including the woman’s age at occurrence and outcome (abortion or
dead birth). This information permits
flexibility in the analysis. Preceding

birth interval, parity, and date at birth
can be calculated for each single live
birth. Moreover, the availability of a
complete fertility history along with
complete residence, education, paidwork, and cohabitation life histories allow us to reconstruct for each woman
her social and economic status and other
demographic characteristics at the moment of each live birth. This permits us
to characterize accurately differentials
in infant mortality in a manner not possible with conventional survey data
(such as the WES). These variable retrievals were done using CASA, a Data
Base Management System Program
written by Nancy Karweit from The
Johns Hopkins University. The units of
analysis for this study then are the 4,928
live single births recorded in the fertility
histories of the two cohort of women.

BREASTFEEDING AS A PROXIMATE
DETERMINANT OF INFANT DEATH

Numerous studies have indicated
that breastfed infants experience a
lower mortality risk than do artificially
fed infants. (For a general review of the
evidence relating breastfeeding and infant mortality, see McCann et al., 1981).
The advantages of breastfeeding stem
from the fact that it 1s nutritionally ideal
assuring that virtually all the infant’s nutritional requirements will be met, and
that, at least for the initial period of infancy, it provides some immunity
against gastrointestinal and respiratory
diseases. There is also evidence that
breastfeeding does, in fact, affect levels
of infant mortality in developing countries (Palloni and Tienda, 1986; Goldberg et al., 1984). Breastfeeding has
been found to be an important factor in
infant survival, even after other characteristics, such as mother’s age at birth,
birth order, education of the mother,

 

Social Biology

and place of residence, have been controlled. Indeed, differentials in breastfeeding often account for many commonly observed differentials in infant
mortality.

Estimates of the breastfeeding and
infant mortality relationship can be biased by methodological problems. First,
since infant’s death curtails the duration
of breastfeeding, the average duration
of breastfeeding among those who survive beyond the first year of age is longer
than among those who die before their
first year. The resulting truncation of
breastfeeding artificially inflates the association between survival status and
breastfeeding duration when in fact it is
death that leads to shorter durations
rather than the other way around. To
avoid this bias, one can, if the data allow
it, truncate the length of total breastfeeding by considering only the duration
to the beginning of the period at risk
(Davanzo et al., 1983). Alternatively,
when the data on length of breastfeeding is least complete, one can disregard
length of breastfeeding and consider
only whether or not the infant was
breastfed at all up to the end of the period at risk (as we do in this study).

Checks on internal consistency at the
time of the interview enhance the reliability of the data. Validation of data
quality is provided by a comparison of
the estimated infant mortality rate of
these births and period estimates of infant mortality. The 1985 Population
Census measured the infant mortality
rate for the total rural area in Colombia
as approximately 52. The estimated infant mortality rate from the longitudinal
rural survey is 42 for the two cohorts
combined (Table 1). Although this
figure is lower than the census estimates,
we expected it to be so since the infant
mortality rate in the survey is calculated

average of rural Colombia.

The sex ratio at birth is 104.5 and
109.1 for babies born to mothers in the
1937-46 and 1955-61 cohorts, respectively, with an overall normal ratio of
105.8. This provides some evidence that
infants of both sexes were accurately recorded. As described below, the survey
also shows the usual sorts of differentials
in infant mortality by sex of child and
age of mother and reproduces the expected trends. We conclude that the
data collected in the rural longitudinal
survey appear to be of sufficient quality
to conduct a study of infant mortality
differentials in rural Colombia.

RESEARCH METHODS

Each live birth included in this analysis was Classified as an infant death (died
during the first year) or a surviving infant (lived at least one year after birth).
The independent variables measure demographic and woman’s status factors.
Those factors are: date of birth (before
1960; 1960-72; after 1972); parity of
birth and interval since last birth (first
birth; 2—4 parity/1—2 years interval; 2-4

‘parity/3 years or longer interval; 5 or

higher parity/1-2 years interval; 5 or
higher parity/3 years or longer interval);
sex of birth (male; female); breastfeeding (none; some); mother’s age at birth
(19 or less; 20-32 years; 33 or more
years); cohabitation at birth (yes; no);
residence at birth (urban; rural); mother’s education at birth (none; primary;
secondary or higher); mother’s paid
work at birth (none; agriculture; industry and services; housework, including
independent domestic service); and

mother’s cohort (1937-46; 1955~61).
Overall infant mortality differentials
were calculated through the crossclassification of birth outcome by these
independent variables.

Given that our main interest is in the
relative effects of woman’s status and
demographic characteristics on infant
death rather than estimates of levels of
infant mortality by subgroups or categories, we use logit models. These models
are suitable for a multivariate analysis of
infant mortality since they consider the
relation between a binary dependent
variable and a set of independent variables. The dependent variable takes on
but two values, say 0 and 1, assumed to
be mutually exclusive and exhaustive.
The logit model then predicts infant
death by:

where E(,Qo) is the predicted (expected)
proportion of infant deaths, X is a vector
of independent variables and B is a vector of estimated parameters. The independent variables can be categorical or
continuous. We defined all variables included in the analysis as categorical. The
design variables for each categorical
variable are considered as a set and their
coefficients are expressed to a baseline
omitted category. When hierarchical
models are built, using stepwise selection procedures, one set of design variables is added or removed from the
model according to its statistical significance. Parameters are then estimated by
a maximum likelihood procedure. (We
use in this analysis the PLR subroutine
of the BMDP computer program. )

coefficient estimates follow the usual

Statistic is used to test the joint hypothesis that all coefficients except the intercept are zero, that is for a test of goodness of fit of the overall model (Aldrich

RESULTS

DIFFERENTIALS IN THE INFANT
MorTALITY RATE

A total of 207 of the 4,928 children
born to the women in this survey died
before reaching their first birthday, producing a probability of infant death of
0.042 (see Table 1). The recorded probability of infant death varies by demographic characteristics and women’s status variables. The sorts of demographic
differentials ordinarily observed in infant death are recorded in this survey.
Males have rates of infant mortality that
are about one-third higher than females
(0.048 vs. 0.036). Substantial declines in
infant mortality are observed across periods with 0.072 of babies born prior to
1960 dying, compared to 0.050 of babies
born in 1960-72 and 0.033 of babies
born after 1972. Babies born to teenage
mothers had a substantially higher probability of infant death. First-born children and higher parity births occurring
after birth intervals of less than two
years displayed considerably higher
probabilities of infant death. There
were no noteworthy differences in the
infant mortality experiences of children
born to mothers who were living with
husbands and those who were single
mothers.

The small number of babies born to
these rural-survey women in urban ar
 

Infant Mortality 197

eas had a slightly lower probability of infant death than those born in rural communities (0.034 vs. 0.043). There were
few differences in the infant mortality
experiences of children born to rural
women in the different economic strata,
although children born to women engaged in paid agricultural labor or paid
housework had substantially higher
probabilities of dying before reaching
age one, Children born to mothers who
had at least a secondary school education had a much lower probability of infant death than other children, but there
was little differential in the infant mortality probabilities of children whose
mothers had no education and those
whose mothers had primary schooling.

Locir MODELS OF INFANT MORTALITY

The earlier ages at first birth, larger
family sizes, and shorter birth intervals
of women in the lower economic stratum and of those with little education
would tend to increase infant mortality
among the children of these women.
What are the net effects of each of these
reproductive characteristics on infant
mortality? Do women’s status variables
influence infant mortality, net of the
characteristics of their reproductive behaviors? To address these questions, we
estimated logit models of infant mortality that simultaneously consider the influences of these demographic and
women’s status variables (see Table 2).
Table 2, Model 1, shows the net effect of
each variable on the logit of infant
death, and Table 2, Model 2, includes
only those variables that have statistically significant effects on the logit of infant mortality.

The probability of an infant death declined between periods even taking into
account the changes in the parity and
spacing of births and mother’s age and

improvements in socioeconomic status.
Females had lower probabilities of
dying before age one than males. Relative to first births, births occurring two
years or less after another birth had
significantly higher probabilities of infant death. This was especially true of
infants born to high parity mothers after

a Short interbirth interval. Comparing

births with similar interbirth intervals,
infants who were second, third, or
fourth children had better survival
chances than babies born to higher parity women. Even taking into account the
greater likelihood that births to teenage
mothers are first births, babies born to
such women have substantially poorer
chances of surviving until age one. However, there are few differences in the
survival chances of children born to
women ages 20-32 and those who are 33
and older. Thus, demographic characteristics of the mothers had substantial
impacts on infant mortality in rural Colombia, and these differentials conform
to those observed in other populations.

Net of these demographic variables,
no measure of women’s status has a
significant additional impact on infant
mortality (see Table 2, Model 2). When
the measures of women’s status are included in the logit model (Table 2,
Model 1), their coefficients generally
confirm this absence of effects with a few
notable exceptions.

Net of other demographic characteristics and measures of women’s status,
we observe only trivial and nonsignificant differentials in infant mortality by
socioeconomic stratum. Women who
were living in rural areas at the time
their children were born experience
higher rates of infant death than those
whose children were born in urban areas, consistent with the better maternal

Infant Mortality 199

and infant health care services available
in urban Colombia. The children of
mothers with a primary school education had no better chance of surviving
their first year than children whose
mothers had no schooling. Children
born to women with secondary schooling had a lower recorded probability of
infant death, but this result was not statistically significant. Other studies have
shown considerable importance of
mother’s education on infant mortality
in Colombia. Although in those studies
mother’s educational level referred to
the moment of the survey rather than to
the moment of the birth (as in this
study), the non-significant effect of
mother’s education on infant mortality
in this study probably is due to the generally low education of these rural
women (averaging 3.6 years in the
1955-61 cohort and 1.8 years in the
1937-46 cohort), rather than to an absence of any educational effects on infant mortality.

Children born to mothers who were
engaged in paid work in agriculture or
the industrial/service sector of the economy had survival chances that appear
slightly higher but were not statistically
different from those of babies whose
mothers were not engaged in wage labor. Babies born to women who worked
as domestics had considerably higher
probabilities of dying before their first
birthday, and these results are statistically significant. Women who are employed as domestics are from the poorest rural families, and these are among
the lowest paying jobs, usually done in
urban areas while the babies stay at
home with their families. It appears
that, even controlling for the generally
low position of these women in the socioeconomic stratification system and

 

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

200

for their low educations, their situation
is associated with higher risks of infant
mortality for their children.
Breastfeeding is an extremely important factor in the survivorship of these
infants. Babies who were not breastfed
have substantially higher probabilities
of dying before age one (see Table 3,
Model 1). While some of this differential is an artifact of the inability to
breastfeed infants who survive only a
few hours or are extremely sick from the
time of birth, this linkage is so strong
that it accords well with other research
documenting the effectiveness of breastfeeding for its nutritional benefits and
the resistance to disease it imparts.
These effects appear especially salient in
a rural population that is relatively poor
and with inferior access to medical care.
Do differentials in breastfeeding account for any of the effects of demographic characteristics or women’s status variables on infant mortality, or does
breastfeeding reduce any differentials
that would otherwise be apparent?
Comparing the coefficients of Table 3,
Model 1, and Table 2, Model 1, there
are several noteworthy differences.
Downward trends in infant mortality
would have been even sharper had there
not been reductions in breastfeeding of
infants in recent years. The higher infant
mortality among high parity births occurring after a short interbirth interval is
nearly matched by lower parity births
with short interbirth intervals, taking
into account breastfeeding practices.
Rural women have higher rates of
breastfeeding than women living in urban areas at the time of birth, and this
partially ameliorates the higher infant
mortality that would otherwise be experienced by rural-born infants. Similarly,
children of women who are engaged in
paid housework would have even higher

 

Florez and Hogan

Social Biology

probabilities of dying but for the more
extensive practice of breastfeeding
among these very poor women. The
other women’s status variables have no
significant impact on infant mortality,
taking into account the breastfeeding
practices of the groups.

Finally, we estimated a model that included all of the demographic characteristics and women’s status variables,
breastfeeding practice, and the birth cohort of the mother (Table 3, Model 2).
This model permits us to confirm that
the effects we observe are not an artifact
of the two-cohort sampling design of the
Colombian study. With the exception of
the trend in infant mortality across birth
years, introducing a control for the cohort structure of the sample does not alter the estimated effects of the variables
on infant mortality. The reduction of the
trend in infant mortality between births
in 1960-72 and after 1972 is more an artifact of collinearity between child’s
birth year and mother’s birth cohort
(since nearly all of the births to the
younger cohort of mothers occurred after 1972) than it is indicative of any bias
associated with the study design.

The inclusion of a variable for mother’s birth cohort also permits a crude assessment of whether intercohort
changes in childrearing practices (apart
from intercohort changes in fertility,
maternal education, and breastfeeding)
have reduced infant mortality. The evidence on this issue is negative, given the
lack of any significant effect of mother’s
birth cohort on the logit of infant death.

Colombia. This study replicates previous research on demographic differentials in infant mortality. Overall differentials in infant mortality by measures
of women’s status are small, but are in
the expected direction. However, multivariate models that take into account
the differing demographic characteristics of births to these women indicate
few persistent differentials in infant
mortality. Most of the observed differentials in infant morality by maternal
statuses are in good part associated with
the differing reproductive behaviors of
the women and variations in breastfeeding practices. Despite these generally
negative findings, there are persistent
disadvantages for the survival of infants
whose mothers work as domestics or
paid houseworkers. Differentials in infant mortality by maternal education are
in the expected direction, but are small
and not statistically significant. This lack
of any clearcut differential in infant
mortality by maternal education is at
least partly attributable to the small
number of children born to highly educated women in this rural population.

Florez and Hogan

Social Biology

The sharp declines in infant mortality
recorded in rural Colombia in recent
decades do not appear to be related to
major improvements in the status of
women. Rather, decreases in fertility
have reduced the number of high parity
and closely spaced births that are especially at risk of infant death. Also, important public health interventions that
have improved infant survivorship have
been shared by all segments of the population. In these ways, rural Colombia
has witnessed major reductions in infant
mortality.
