ABSTRACT: Small but consistently positive correlations between standing height and general
intelligence (the unrotated first principal component across the battery of cognitive tests) were
found across sexes, racial/ethnic groups (Americans of European vs. Americans of Japanese
ancestry), and generations in data from the Hawaii Family Study of Cognition. Sibling data
produced significant height-intelligence correlations for sibling pair means (i.e., betweenfamily differences) but not for within sibling pair differences. The lack of within-family heightintelligence correlations suggested that the two traits were linked due to cross-assortative mating and/or between-family environmental influences (e.g., nutrition) affecting both traits. Some

evidence for both of these explanations was found.

As Humphreys et al. (1985) describe
in their literature review, numerous
studies have obtained small (around
0.20) but consistently positive correlations between standing height and intelligence or correlates of intelligence
(e.g., academic achievement, occupation, social class, etc.). Jensen (1980a)
proposed that the correlation between
height and intelligence was an “extrinsic” correlation appearing between families (i.e., when sibling pair means for
height and intelligence are correlated)
but not within families (i.e., when sibling pair differences are correlated).

A within-family correlation would
suggest pleiotropy, that the same genes
are involved in the development of both
height and intelligence. When there is
only a between-family correlation, however, the two traits may have become
linked as a result of (1) cross-assortative
mating, where although height and intelligence have no functional relationship to each other, people possessing a

110

greater degree of one trait are married
to spouses possessing a greater degree of
the other trait; (2) genetic linkage, due
to the genes controlling the two traits
being in close proximity on the same
chromosome (this correlation, however, would be expected to diminish
over several generations of random genetic recombination); and (3) an extrinsic environmental factor operating between but not within families (e.g.,
social class, cultural background, family
nutritional status, etc.) (Jensen, 1980b).
A sibling study by Laycock and Caylor
(1964) and a twin study by Husen
(1959), in fact, found no evidence for a
within-family genetic basis for the
height-intelligence correlation.

Jensen has argued for cross-assortative mating as the basis for the height-intelligence correlation, while Husen has
argued for the influence of the common
intrauterine environment shared by siblings. As noted by Humphreys et al.
(1985), either argument would have dif

ficulties accounting for the changes in
the height-intelligence correlations
across ages and sexes found by Humphreys et al. Data from the Hawaii Family Study of Cognition (HFSC) (DeFries
et al., 1979; Wilson et al., 1975) allow
for replications of previous findings and
for some tests of hypotheses regarding
the basis of the height-intelligence correlation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SUBJECTS

A total of 1,816 families (both biological parents and one or more of their
teen-aged or older offspring, for a total
of 6,581 individuals) took part in the
HFSC (see DeFries et al., 1979, and
Wilson et al., 1975, for descriptions of
the HFSC). Americans of European ancestry (AEA; 926 families) and Americans of Japanese ancestry (AJA; 368
families) were the two largest racial/
ethnic groups tested in Hawaii. There
were 369 AEA families and 115 AJA
families with two or more offspring
tested, allowing for analyses of
between- vs. within-sibship correlations.

MEASURES

The 15 tests that make up the HFSC
cognition battery, as well as the alpha
reliabilities of the tests and their loadings on the unrotated first principal compoment, are presented in DeFries et al.
(1979) and Wilson et al. (1975). The first
principal component is a measure of
general intelligence and has been found
to correlate 0.73 with full-scale Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)
scores (Kuse, 1977). The loadings on the
unrotated first principal component
have been found to be virtually identical
across racial/ethnic groups, as well as

across sexes and generations (Nagoshi
et al., 1984). First principal component
scores were age-corrected by standardizing scores within age bands (DeFries
et al., 1979; Wilson et al., 1975). All
subjects in the HFSC were also measured on their standing height. Offspring height was age corrected for the
present analyses through regression
procedures.

In calculating the between-families
(BF) and within-families (WF) scores
for height and intelligence, only one pair
of siblings was used per family, i.e., the
oldest and next oldest tested son for
brother pair analyses, the oldest and
next oldest tested daughter for sister
pair analyses, and the oldest tested son
and daughter for brother-sister pair
analyses. BF scores were the mean score
for a sibling pair on a variable, while WF
scores were obtained by simply subtracting the score for the second member of
the pair from the first. As noted by Jensen (19805), WF difference scores are
less reliable than the BF mean scores,
but since cognitive factor scores typically have high reliabilities and measured height near perfect reliability, this
should not greatly bias the reported
results.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Table 1 presents the correlation of
height with first principal component
scores by generation (parent vs. offspring), sex, and ethnic group (AEA vs.
AJA). These correlations are small, but
all are positive and consistent with previous studies. We have no obvious explanations for the lower magnitude of
the offspring correlations. The magnitude of the offspring correlations did not
change when separate correlations were
calculated for offspring younger vs.
those older than 18 years of age, ruling

out maturational factors as an explanation.

Table 2 presents the BF and WF correlations of height and first principal
component scores for offspring brother
pairs, sister pairs, and brother-sister
pairs separately for AEA and AJA families. These results generally confirm
previous findings that the height-intelligence correlation is an extrinsic correlation, i.e., the correlation only exists between and not within families.

For approximately 870 pairs of AEA
parents, the spouse correlation for
height is 0.22 and for the first principal
component 0.23, while for approximately 310 pairs of AJA parents, the
corresponding spouse correlations are
0.12 and 0.15. The generally lower
spouse correlations, as well as familialities, for AJA compared to AEA families on various HFSC variables have
been reported previously (e.g., DeFries

et al., 1979) and may be due to a greater
degree of genetic and/or cultural homogeneity in the AJA sample.

If there were no cross-assortative
mating for height and intelligence, then
the expected correlations of father’s
height and mother’s intelligence and of
mother’s height and father’s intelligence
would simply be a product of the separate spouse correlations presented
above and the within-individual correlation of height and intelligence presented
in Table 1. The expected cross-trait
spouse correlation would hence be essentially zero. The actual correlation of
father’s height and mother’s intelligence
for AEA parents is 0.12 (p<0.001),
while the correlation of mother’s height
and father’s intelligence is 0.07
(p<0.05). For AJA parents, the corresponding correlations are 0.08 (n.s.) and
—0.02 (n.s.). There is thus some evidence for cross-assortative mating for

height and intelligence, especially for
mother’s intelligence and father’s
height. However, this cross-assortative
mating may not be the direct cause of
the height-intelligence correlation in
offspring, if this cross-assortment is not
due to active phenotypic assortment,
but instead 1s simply due to social class
differences in both height and intelligence coupled with assortative mating
i by class (for a discussion of the different

parent height-intelligence correlations
presented in Table 1 were reduced by
0.02 when this partialling was done. On
the other hand, there was no change in
the offspring height-intelligence correlations when HFSC father’s occupational
status was partialled out. Occupational
status, however, is probably a weak indicator of the kind of nutritional factors
that Humphreys et al. (1985) suggest is
the extrinsic environmental factor underlying the height-intelligence correlation.
