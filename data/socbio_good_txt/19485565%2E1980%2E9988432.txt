Education and Accuracy of Age Reporting Among
Yoruba Females in Western Nigeria

ABSTRACT: The relationship between education and accuracy of age reporting is investigated by
using data collected from Yoruba females in Western Nigeria. Although in the long run the future
improvement in age reporting in Nigeria and the rest of the developing world will depend on improved literacy, the findings suggest that at present education of respondent may not significantly
contribute to accurate age reporting. It is suggested that, for the near future, improvement of vital
registration would be the major factor leading to accurate reporting. Improved vital registration
would increase people’s knowledge of their age and lead to more accurate reporting.

In developing countries age distributions reported in censuses or surveys are
usually affected by marked misstatement
of age (United Nations, 1967, p. 15), yet
data on age are essential in the computation of basic demographic measures
needed for the study of population
change. As more effort is being devoted to
collecting adequate demographic data in
these countries, interest is directed to aspects of socioeconomic development that
would lead to collection of more reliable
information. The influence of education
on age-data collection is one of the areas
of primary interest in this effort.

Generally, age misreporting in developing countries has been attributed to illiteracy or lack of formal education (Van de
Walle, 1966). Therefore it is widely believed that with increasing formal education (especially that of the respondent) accuracy of age reporting will improve. This
paper examines the effect of education of
respondent on accuracy of age reporting
among Yoruba females in Western Nigeria.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data for this paper were largely drawn
from the first of three surveys constituting
the Nigerian segment of the Changing African Family Project—a cross-cultural
study of changes within the family which
are, Or may ultimately be, related to
changes in fertility levels and patterns
(Okediji et al., 1976; Sembajwe, 1977).
This survey covered Yoruba females aged
15-59 living in Ibadan City in 1973.

A total of 6,606 eligible respondents
were selected on a random sample basis
with a selection fraction of 1 out of 24. Ibadan was divided into 359 grids and a random sample of 1 block out of 24 blocks
within each grid square was selected. A
complete listing of population in the selected blocks was made, and all eligible respondents were interviewed.

Interviewers were nearly all Yoruba females with at least four years of secondary
education. Some male interviewers were
used, comprising about 7 per cent of all interviewers. One supervisor was employed
for every two interviewers, and both the

supervisor and the interviewer went back
to discuss further with the interviewees
any inconsistent results. Much effort and
money were devoted to selecting and
training interviewers, and these factors together with close supervision were expected to lead to good quality data. Therefore, except where the interviewer made
the estimate of age, his/her effect on the
results was very minimal and caused no
systematic bias. The language of interview
was Yoruba, and the original questionnaire was in Yoruba.

During the survey, the question on age
was asked in two forms:

(1) Age, and
(2) Year of birth as follows:
Please tell me how old you are (use indirect approach if advisable). That means the
year of your birth was (write in) 19——
(check inconsistencies and try to find age).

The sections in parentheses were instructions to the interviewers. The second
part of the question was intended as a
check, and the interviewers were strictly
instructed not to subtract the reported age
from 1973 (the year of the survey) to obtain the date of birth without first asking
the woman her date of birth and then asking further questions if there were any inconsistencies. As a scale of accuracy the
interviewer had to assign the respondent
to one of the following:

(1) Accurate—if the woman gave an exact
date of birth as well as the age without
difficulty.’

(2) Probably accurate—if the respondent
gave the age and an imprecise date of
birth such as “I think during the rainy
season of 1930.”

(3) Estimate made by woman.—For example, ‘I was born two years before the
end of World War II,” or “‘I must be
about 30 because my brother who is
about two or three years older than me
is 33.”

(4) Estimate made by interviewer. If the
woman herself did not know her age

Age Reporting Among Yoruba Females

295

and could not give an event that happened around the time of her birth, the
interviewer had to estimate the age.
(The interviewer was particularly instructed that it would be better if he
asked the woman politely how old she
was when she was married, for those
who were married, and the length of
time she had been married and then
make a calculation and say, ‘‘Well, if I
can do my arithmetic right, you were
born in 19-——.”’)

Two major criticisms about this type of
question are warranted. First, emphasis
was put on recording the year of birth
rather than the date of birth. The month
and day of birth were given little emphasis, thus leaving a wide margin of error
in age recording. Secondly, much reliance
was put on the interviewers’ calculations
to estimate ages of respondents who could
not report their dates of birth. The possibility of an arithmetic error on the part of the
interviewer was not provided for. Probably if the interviewer had been instructed
to record the date of marriage and/or the
duration of marriage of the respondent,
this type of error would have been
avoided.

Nevertheless, information on age collected in this survey provides a good opportunity to test the hypothesis that education increases the accuracy of age
reporting, and as noted above the interviewers’ effect on the results of women
said to have reported their age accurately
is minimal. Most (54 per cent) of the
women in Ibadan had no formal education. But a fair number of women had
some education: 27 per cent had a primary
school education; 14 per cent had some
secondary education; and 5 per cent had
completed secondary school] or gone beyond.

RESULTS

As expected, data from the survey and
other surveys in Nigeria in Table 1 clearly

demonstrate that it is mainly educated individuals who reported their age “‘accurately” (“‘Accurate” or “‘accurately”’ are
used in this paper to mean that the age reported was said to be accurate.) In Ibadan
City only 20 per cent of women who had
no schooling reported age “accurately”
while 78 per cent of women with a secondary education and higher did so. Reporting was better among young age groups
than among the older groups (Table 2,
bottom). This finding is as expected since
the spread of Western-type of education is
a relatively recent phenomenon in Western Nigeria. The findings agree with those
from other developing countries, for example, India (Ambannavar and Visaria,
1975).

The next logical step was to investigate

the age distributions of the respondents
divided by type of age reporting ‘“‘accuracy,” 1.e., those who were reported to
have stated their age “accurately” as opposed to those who were reported to have
had doubts about their age or whose age
was estimated. Special attention was paid
to those women reported to have stated
their age “‘accurately”’ to see whether their
age distribution appears significantly less
distorted than the overall age distribution
and, in particular, less distorted than the
age distribution of the respondents whose
age reporting was said to have been inaccurate.

Figure 1 plots the “‘reported accurately” distribution with that for the overall survey population and for the “‘inaccurately reported” distribution. The most
striking revelation is that women who reported their age “accurately” exhibit
more extreme heaping on age twenty

than those who reported their age inaccurately. There is similar heaping on age 25
and, to a certain extent, less heaping on
age 30 and the rest of the ages ending in
“0” and “5S” for those said to have reported their age “accurately” than for
those who reported inaccurately.

To detect errors in age data, several
methods are used. One of them is Myers
(1940) blended method for calculating indexes of terminal digit preference which
takes into account the effect of mortality.
The results for Ibadan indicate that there
was much concentration on ages ending in
“0” and “5” (the indexes for these digits
were 21.7 and 11.3 respectively). On the
other hand, there was much avoidance for
ages ending in “‘1”’ and “9” and to a lesser
extent those ending in “‘4” and ‘‘7”. The
summary index is 27.0, indicating that a
substantial proportion of the female population reported their age incorrectly. The

same pattern of preference is characteristic of many other African countries (Nagi
et al., 1973, pp. 168-169).

Looking at the ‘“‘accurately” reported
distributions (Figure 2), we can observe
that for both groups of women (those with
some education and those with no education) there is marked heaping on ages 20,
25, and 30 and to a lesser extent on ages
35, 40, and 45. In addition, there appears
to be a concentration of respondents in the
age range 20-34 for both groups of respondents, indicating that at present education
does not lead to significantly better reporting of age in Ibadan, even though women
who are said to have reported their age
‘“‘accurately”’ are mainly those with education. This finding is not unique to Ibadan.
In India it was found that the quality of age
returns in successive Indian censuses since
1951 deteriorated in spite of rapid growth
in literacy and education (Ambannavar
and Visaria, 1975, p. 14).

Looking at the survey distribution in
isolation, one would be led to conclude
that the unusual bulge in the age range
20-34 can be explained by rural-urban migration since Ibadan is a city likely to attract a significant number of migrants as
do other urban centers. It would seem that
rural-urban migration caused the unusual

PER CENT

bulge in the survey age distribution—that
while the rural areas lost young adults age
20-34 the urban areas gained persons of
these ages. To a certain extent this may be
true. But to a greater extent the bulge in
the age distribution must be due to other
factors because the claim that migration
into the city accounts for the bulge is discounted by available evidence (Figure 3).
The bulge is equally characteristic of both
the migrant and indigenous women age
distributions. For indigenous women, 66
per cent are in age range 20-34 as opposed
to 65 per cent for migrant women.

Both the 1963 census and the survey
show almost an identical bulge in age
range 20-34, while age group 15-19 and
some of the older age groups suffer unusual deficits (see Ibadan Division rural and
urban groups in Figure 4). The bulge in
age range 20-34 is not only characteristic
of Ibadan City but also of the whole of Nigeria and the Western Region (Figure 4)
and other regions in Nigeria (Olusanya,
1975, pp. 254-274). Omiata found the
same characteristic in a rural locality of
Western Nigeria, and the same is true of
Orubuloye’s Ekiti and Ibadan rural age
distributions (Omiata, 1975; Orubuloye,
1977). Similar distortions were observed
in a number of other African countries

be approximated by a selected stable population model. Two parameters are required to select this stable population
model from Brass’s two-parameter model
life tables (Carrier and Hobcraft, 1971).
In this study, 1, (the proportion surviving
to age two) estimated for Ibadan as 895
per thousand, and a gross reproduction
rate of 2.7 (again estimated for Ibadan
from the survey information) were used to
select the model (Sembajwe, 1977, pp.
87-88).

The selected population distribution
shown in Table 3 has 428 per thousand of
the population under 15 years, while the
proportion aged 45 and over is 143 per
thousand. In the survey there were 6,606
women interviewed aged 15 to 59, and
6,128 of these represented age group
15-44. If we assume that the 6,128 women
represent 429 per thousand of the female
population as would be the case in the stable population model, then the female
population under 15 years (which is equivalent to 428 per thousand according to the
stable population model) would be 6,114',

"Population under 15 = (6,128+0.429) x
0.428 = 6,114.

and the population aged 45 and over .
(which is equivalent to 143 per thousand
according to the model) would be 2,043.
This brings the total sample population in
the survey, 1f females of all ages had been
interviewed, to 14,286 (6,114 under 15;
6,128 in age group 15-44; and 2,043 over
44 years). The distribution of this population compared with the selected stable
population distribution per thousand is
shown in Table 3. The last column of the
table shows the relative excess or deficit of
the recorded population over that of the
stable population in each age group. The
evidence confirms that there is indeed an
excess of females in age range 20-34 as observed earlier.

Table 4 presents an estimation of the
possible transfers of women from one age
group to another. The transfers from
younger to older age groups and from
older to younger age groups converge on
age group 25-29 which in addition to having the expected population recorded has
some gains from age groups 20-24 and
30-34. The longest transfer occurred from
age group 15-19 to 20-24, suggesting that
some women under age 20 reported themselves or were reported as 20 years and
over. On the other hand, the table indicates that some women over the age of 34
reported themselves or were reported by
the interviewer as younger. Therefore,
the analysis confirms further that there
were transfers of women from younger
and older age groups to the age range
20-34.

DISCUSSION

One possible factor explains the extreme heaping on age 20 for women who
allegedly reported their age “accurately.”
It is possible that those who were not married and/or without children but over 20
might have reported 20 as their age to appear young, while those who were married

*Comparing the transfers from any age group with transfers fo that age group, the following can be observed from the table:
(1) Age group 15~19 lost 49 per 1,000 persons to age group 20-24.

early and/or had children but were under
20 may have reported age 20 or a higher
age in order to appear older, especially in
view of the fact that among the Yoruba social status is very much attached to age.
Similar reasons can be put forward for
ages 25 and 30, while the universal digital
preference might have been an additional
cause of heaping on these ages and the major cause for heaping on ages 35, 40, 45,
50, and 55. One other explanation for the
distortion may be that educated women
are ashamed to admit that they do not
know their birth dates (which may well be
the case if their parents were illiterate)
and therefore give an estimate which they
claim is exact. Often the date of birth may
have already been acquired when these
women signed a written statement before
a lawyer as a part of the requirement for
getting a job in the modern sector. This
would suggest that in the short run the education of the respondent may not be a
primary factor determining age accuracy.

 

It would appear that the education of
parents (the first generation) would be the
primary factor since it is the parents who
normally register births of their children.
Education of parents would not, however,
be effective on its own unless it were accompanied by improved vital registration.
Vital registration, if adequately practiced,
would not only improve age reporting
among literate populations, but also
among illiterate ones because the mere
fact that there will be a record of birth as
an event will increase people’s knowledge
of their birth dates and will facilitate the
accurate reporting of age.

In the long run, education as a part of
socioeconomic development would increase people’s knowledge about the necessity for reporting their age accurately
and hence the need for keeping accurate
birth-date records and related improved
reporting. However, in the short run, successful registration systems could be the
immediate solution to accurate age re

cords if they are started in countries with
administrative structures which extend
their administrative institutions right to
the village level. For example, it would be
possible for a country like Tanzania,
which has village governments as the
smallest administrative units, to entrust
one of the village officials with the task of
monitoring and recording vital events
(such as births, deaths, marriage and migration) in the village.

With regard to future research, it
would be useful to identify respondents
who have birth certificates and compare
their recorded age distribution with the
distribution of those who have no birth
certificates. Such information would be
useful for indicating the relationship between vital registration and accuracy of
age reporting.

CONCLUSIONS

Education of respondent does not appear to improve the accuracy of age reporting significantly. Although it is mainly
educated women, especially the younger
ones, who are Said to have reported their
age and date of birth without difficulty,
women who were said to have reported

their age ‘‘accurately”’ exhibited age heapings and distortions similar to those of
women who were not able to give their
date of birth or to report their age.

The survey age data exhibit the characteristic distortions found in most developing countries, and in Nigeria in particular.
The distribution shows a bulge in age
range 20-34, and this remains true even
after controlling for education and migration status. Substantial upward shifts in
age by persons under 20 to ages over 20,
and to a less extent, downward shifts in
age by persons over 35 are the most likely
explanations for this bulge.

It appears therefore that although the
future improvement in age reporting in
Nigeria and the rest of the developing
world will in the long run depend on improved literacy, in the short run, education of respondent may not significantly
contribute to accurate age reporting, especially if the majority of the individuals
still have illiterate parents who might have
not bothered to register their children’s
birth dates or to whom registration facilities were not available when they had their
children. It is suggested that improvement
of vital registration would be the major
factor leading to rapid improvement in
age reporting.
