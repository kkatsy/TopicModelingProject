> ABSTRACT: Men and women in national surveys from four countries, the United States, Canada,
‘= Great Britain, and Norway, give mutually inconsistent reports of numbers of opposite-gender
© sexual partners. In all cases the number of female partners reported by men exceeds the number
® of male partners reported by women. Gender difference in reporting bias seems to be the most

oo plausible explanation for the discrepancies.
So

~ Sexual behavior may be among the

“ most difficult topics on which to collect
«reliable data. First, sexual behavior
‘S concerns intimate personal matters.
= Reporting on such matters, even in
= fully confidential and/or anonymous
“ settings, conflicts at least in part with
© the inherently private nature of sexual
‘Z behavior (Bradburn and Sudman,
s 1979; Catania et al., 1986; DeMaio,
5 1984). Second, sexual behavior is
>,deeply entangled with issues of self= image and personality. Sexual behav3 iors are not merely discrete physical
© activities, but activities that are associ= ated with basic notions of self-esteem
4 and are integral parts of self-definition.
Third, a number of sexual behaviors
are either morally condemned by large
segments of society (e.g., homosexuality and infidelity) or illegal (e.g., rape,
incest, and child molestation). Reports
related to such behaviors open respondents to moral disapproval (by an interviewer) and/or potential social and
legal repercussions (should confidentiality be breached). Fourth, much sexual behavior can not be validated, and

even what validation is theoretically
possible can be achieved only through
elaborate and expensive research designs (Miller et al., 1990). Finally, the
above inherent difficulties of studying
sexual behavior are made worse by the
dearth of experience in collecting sexual behavior data. Despite the manifest importance and centrality of sexual
behavior, there have been few surveys
designed to collect such data and even
less methodological work on developing optimal collection procedures
(Smith, 1991a).

This paper examines the reliability
of one key type of sexual behavior by
comparing reports of the number of
opposite gender sex partners reported
by men and women. Within a closed
population, the number of female sexual partners reported by men must
equal the number of male sexual
partners reported by women. Thus,
agreement between men and women
validates the aggregate reports and
suggests that the reports are reliable.
Discrepancies on the other hand indicate either a deviation from the closed

204

population assumption or some inaccuracy in the data for one or both genders
(Gurman, 1989).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data on number of sexual partners
are available from eight surveys in four
countries. Basic details on these surveys are given in Table 1. Each are
representative probability samples of
either all adults or of adults up to
approximately age 60. Three different
data collection modes are employed:
six used self-completion forms during a
personal interview, one was over the
telephone, and one was a mail questionnaire.

Each of these surveys asks a series
of questions that allows the determination of number of heterosexual partners over varying reference periods
(question wordings available in Smith,
1991b). These questions differ in their
wordings, response categories, and
time frames.

We will (1) report the results from
each survey, considering as we do possible adjustments, and (2) examine the
general pattern across all surveys.

RESULTS
NORC-GSS, 1988-1990

In the 1988, 1989, and 1990 General
Social Surveys (Davis and Smith,
1990), the number of female sexual
partners during the last twelve months
reported by men greatly exceeded the
number of male partners reported by
women. In 1988, among all male heterosexuals the mean number of partners reported was 1.84, while female
heterosexuals reported only 0.98 partners. In 1989 the number of partners
reported were 1.48 by men and 0.90 by
women. In 1990 the number of partners reported by men was 1.85 and for
women it was 0.90. Neither the means
for men nor women are statistically different across years. Among heterosexuals, for each female partner that a
man has, a woman has a male partner.
Thus in a closed population the number of heterosexual partners for
women should be equaled by the number of heterosexual partners for men.
Instead of parity, we find that the ratio
of female partners to male partners is
1.88:1 in 1988; 1.64:1 in 1989; and
2.06:1 in 1990.

First, we consider the possibility
that these differences are the result of
a few extreme values affecting the
mean. Means, of course, can be disproportionately affected by a small proportion of cases with extreme values.
Such cases have been shown to distort
findings on frequency of sexual intercourse (Jasso, 1985; Kahn and Udry,
1986; Jasso, 1986), and there has been
speculation that similar distortion
might be occurring in reports of number of sexual partners (Wadsworth et
al., 1990). Since the GSS figures are
based on grouped ranges (0/1/2/3/4/510/11-20/21-100/101+), they already
reduce the impact of extreme values.
We further minimized their impact by
converting all reports in the top two
categories (21-100 partners, and more
than 100 partners) to 30 partners. This
reduced the mean number of female
and male partners in 1988 to 1.51 and
0.94 and the ratio to 1.61:1. For 1989
the number of female and male partners decreased to 1.43 and 0.86, but
the ratio marginally increased to
1.66:1. For 1990 the truncated mean
for men was 1.59 and for women 0.90
(unchanged). This reduced the femaleto-male ratio from 2.06:1 to 1.77:1.
Thus, truncation does not eliminate
the discrepancies in reported number
of sex partners. In addition, since we
have no empirical basis to question the
extreme cases, we can not accept the
truncated values as more accurate than
the raw values.

Next, we consider the possibility
that differences in the magnitude or
pattern of item nonresponse might explain the discrepancies. Nonresponse
is always a potential cause of bias and
there is some evidence that nonresponse on sexual behavior items is correlated with having a less permissive

sexual orientation in general and fewer
sex partners in particular (Catania et
al., 1986). For nonresponse to account
for the differences observed here, nonrespondents among men would have to
have fewer partners than responding
men and/or nonrespondents among
women would have to have more partners than responding women. Overall,
there are similar levels on item nonresponse (including not doing the
whole self-completion supplement) for
men (1988=6.6 per cent; 1989=10.4
per cent; 1990= 15.8 per cent) and for
women (1988 = 5.9 per cent; 1989 =9.1
per cent; 1990=14.5 per cent). An
analysis of this nonresponse found that
“nonresponse does not appear to be
related to differences in sexual behavior. Nonresponse differentials appear
to be absent among those variables
most closely related to sexual behavior. Nonresponse instead is related to
general factors such as low political interest and general uncooperativeness
that are not highly related to sexual
behavior (Smith, 1989).” It therefore
appears unlikely that nonresponse explains the discrepancies in number of
heterosexual partners.

Finally, we consider whether differences in the gender distribution of the
target population can explain the differences. Within a closed population
the number of cross-group dyads must
have the same mean only if the two
groups are equal in size. In a population of two men and eight women, if
women reported a mean of one male
partner, the men would have a mean
of four female partners. Of course
within the target population (U.S.
residents 18+ living in households),
the two genders are in fairly close
balance. There is, however, a surplus
of women, and when we compare the

206 Smith

aggregate number of partners reported
for the total populations of men and
women, we find that the ratios are reduced. For example, in 1988, multiplying 1.84 female partners by an estimated 81,113,000 heterosexual men
gives 149,248,000 female partners in
total. For women 0.98 times 90,717,000
gives 88,903,000 male partners. The ratio between the total number of female
and male partners is 1.68:1. For 1989
the adjusted ratio if 1.47:1, and for
1990 it is 1.84:1. Thus, the adjustments
for the relative share of the two populations does lessen the discrepancy, but
does not explain it away.

In 1989 and 1990 it was also possible
to compare the number of lifetime
adult partners reported by men and
women. As with the annual rates reported above, among heterosexuals
the number of partners reported by
each gender should balance out once
out-of-scope partners are accounted
for. Because of greater error in recall,
the greater likelihood of out-of-scope
partners, and much higher item nonresponse, the adult lifetime comparisons
of male and female partners are more
problematic than the comparisons
based on the last year counts of number of partners. These complications
would not necessarily have any systematic effect on gender differences in reports on number of partners and would
seem to be insufficient to account for
the large differences between genders
in Table 2. Both with and without adjustments for item nonresponse and
extreme values, men report a much
higher number of partners than women
do (female-to-male ratios of 3-4:1).!

1The greater adult lifetime discrepancy between
men and women suggests that the differential in last
year reports was not the result of greater telescoping
among men than among women.

In brief, there is no evidence that
nonresponse explains the discrepancies
in number of sex partners. Extreme
values explain some of the difference
in the annual rates (in 1988 and 1990 if
not for 1989) and the adult lifetime
rates, but there is no evidence that the
extreme values are errant; and differences in population distribution do
potentially explain some, but by no
means all, of the difference.

UNITED STATES, 1970

The 1970 NORC survey conducted
for the Kinsey Institute (Klassen et al.,
1989; NORC, 1987; Klassen et al.,
1989) found that men had between
7.26-7.44 female partners before their
first marriage, while women reported
0.87—-0.88 premarital male partners for
a ratio of 8.34-8.45:1. Truncating extreme values to 50 reduced the number
of female partners reported by men to
6.80-6.97 and lowered the ratio to
7.82-7.92:1. Item nonresponse was
higher for men (11.5 per cent) than for
women (4.2 per cent), but an extensive analysis of the correlates of non
 
Vol. 39, No. 3~4

response indicated that nonresponse
was not particularly related to sexual
behavior and the correlates were similar for men and for women. Since the
reference period was before marriage
for cohorts over the entire century, no
age-gender adjustments for the target
population were conducted.

CANADA

The 1988 Canadian survey (Ornstein, 1989) found that men reported
3.61 female partners over the last five
= years, while women reported 1.17 male

3.09:1. We examined the impact of extreme values by truncating values
above 50 to that maximum. That lowered the number of female partners
reported by men to 3.32. Since no
women reported more than 50 partners, their mean remained 1.17 and the

ratio fell to 2.84:1. Since item nonresponse was nearly equal for both genders (men =5.4 per cent, women =5.8
per cent), no adjustment was made for
this factor. Since there are slightly
more women 18+ than men 18+, the
unadjusted ratio for the target population falls to 2.92:1, and the truncated
ratio for the target population is
2.69:1.

GREAT BRITAIN

The 1988-89 British survey (Wadsworth et al., 1990) asked about number
of sexual partners over the last six
months, year, two years, five years,
and lifetime. The number of female
partners reported for men was respectively 0.99, 1.22, 1.58, 2.59, and 9.15,
and the number of male partners reported by women was respectively
0.85, 0.95, 1.12, 1.49, and 2.79. The
female-to-male ratios were 1.16:1 for
six months, 1.29:1 for one year, 1.42:1
for two years, 1.73:1 for five years, and
3.28:1 for one’s lifetime. The lifetime
number of female and male partners
was reported as respectively 11.0 and
2.9 for a ratio of 3.79:1 (Maddox,
1989), but it was later stated that “the
mean number of ‘lifetime partners’ was
misreported in the article; our figures
show a smaller disparity between
means for men and women” (Johnson
et al., 1990). Our figures are calculated
from data presented in Wadsworth et
al., 1990.

Since these figures are calculated
from reported means and grouped
data, we cannot calculate truncated
means, but the available information
indicates that truncation would have
reduced the ratio in a manner similar
to that of other surveys (Wadsworth
et al., 1990). Item nonresponse levels
ranged from 7.0 to 14.7 per cent across
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:44 08 December 2015

208

time periods for men and from 7.5 to
10.9 per cent for women. No adjustment was made for this nonresponse.
We applied adjustments based on the
age-gender structure of the target population for the figures for six months to
five years. (Lifetime figures were not
adjusted since the age-gender structure
at any single point in time is not applicable.) Since there are slightly more
men than women, the ratios widened:
six months=1.18:1, one year=1.32:1,
two years=1.44:1, and five years=
1.76:1.

NORWAY

The 1987 Norwegian survey (Sundet
et al., 1988; Sundet et al., 1989) indicated that men had 12.52 female partners over their lifetime, while women
had 5.21 male partners for a ratio of
2.40:1. When extreme values were
truncated to 115, the number of female
partners dropped to 11.29, and the ratio to 2.17:1. Item nonresponse did not
vary greatly by gender (men=9.7 per
cent, women=8.1 per cent), so no adjustments were made. Since there are
slightly more Norwegian men age
18-60 than women, the unadjusted ratio for the target population rose to
2.50:1, and the truncated ratio increased to 2.25:1.

GENERAL RESULTS

Table 3 indicates that in all surveys
men report more female partners than
women report male partners. (This is
also true in other studies. See May et
al., 1989 and Kinsey et al., 1953.) The
ratio of female-to-male partners ranges
from a low of 1.16:1 among the British
over the last six months to 8.45:1
among Americans before their first
marriage. It is clear that the discrep
Smith

Social Biology

ancies increase as the reference period
lengthens, and there may also be crossnational differences in the magnitude
of the ratio, but the discrepancies in all
cases are in the same direction.

Item nonresponse levels are usually
similar for men and women, although
marginally higher for men. At least in
the five American surveys there is little
evidence that item nonresponse is
linked to sexual behavior. (The 1990
National Alcohol Study suggests that
nonresponse might be higher among
the sexually less active, but nonresponse is not related to gender.) In all
but one case (1 year rates in the U.S. in
1989), truncation reduces the discrepancies, but the decreases are small and
are not necessarily more accurate than
the untruncated ratios. Finally, adjusting for the gender distribution of the
target population decreases the ratios
when the entire adult population is
covered (Canada and United States)
and increases the ratios when the elderly are excluded (Great Britain and
Norway). As the survey-by-survey discussion above indicated, various adjustments of the data for item nonresponse, extreme values, and the agegender structure of the various target
population occasionally moderate the
differences, but do not explain them.

DISCUSSION
EXPLANATIONS FOR THE DISCREPANCIES

There are three basic possible explanations for the discrepancies in the
number of sexual partners: (a) noncoverage, (b) nonresponse, and (c) misreports. Our analysis (reported in Smith,
1991b) concludes that intentional misreports are most likely the main source
of the discrepancies.

Intentional misreports probably
consist of some combination of overreporting by men and underreporting
by women (Kinsey et al., 1953; May et
al., 1989; Ornstein, 1989). This pattern
is supported by the known gender differences in sexual values. Women are
less approving of sexual permissiveness
than men, and both men and women
are less approving of sexual permis© siveness among women than men. For
example, in the 1970 NORC/Kinsey
study of sexual attitudes and behaviors, 31 per cent of men thought it was
always wrong for a teenage male to
have sex with a girl he loved and 37 per
cent thought it was wrong for a teenage
girl to do the same. Among women, 44
per cent objected to a teenage male
having sex and 55 per cent objected to
a teenage female having sex. Using the
men’s disapproval of the teenage male
as the norm closest to that guiding
their self-reports and the women’s disapproval of the teenage female as the
norm, we see an approval gap of 24
percentage points (31 percent com

pared to 55 per cent). This gap suggests
that women are under more pressure
to minimize reports of sexual activity
than are men. Data from the GSS is
consistent with this pattern (Smith,
1991b).

Moreover, there is one bit of evidence that both fits the hypothesis of
exaggeration by men and underreports
by women and also offers an explanation for the rising differentials over
longer reference periods. Discrepancies may increase as the time period
lengthens because the longer the time
frame, the more reports of premarital
sexual activity are covered. Over the
last year, reports of sexual partners
among the currently married are almost all within marriage rates (except
for those married for less than a year),
while for those currently unmarried almost all are reporting on pre- or postmarital activity (except for those divorced or widowed within the last
year). For lifetime rates, people will
be reporting over the total number
of sexually active years—premarital,

marital, and postmarital. If most sexual partners are accumulated during
nonmarital years (and data on both
sexual activity by marital status and
age and monogamy support this assumption; see Greeley et al., 1990;
Smith, 1990) and if men feel compelled
to exaggerate their number of sexual
partners and/or women feel conStrained to underreport their number
of partners, then longer term reports,
which cover more nonmarital years,
would be the most distorted.

If premarital reports are the main
source of misreports, then we would
expect the discrepancies to be greatest
for premarital reports. This appears to
be the case since the premarital reports
for the 1970 U.S. survey show the largest discrepancy. In addition, in the
GSS studies the discrepancy between
the sexes on number of partners comes
almost entirely from the unmarried.
In each year the married respondents
did not significantly differ in their
reported number of sex partners (1988:
men =1.29, women =1.10; 1989: men =
1.00, women =0.91; 1990: men= 1.06,
women = 1.00). Unmarried men on the
other hand reported many more partners than unmarried women (respectively 2.67 vs. 0.86 in 1988, 2.29 vs.
0.89 in 1989, and 2.97 vs. 0.81). Of
course the marital status of partners is
not known and could vary by gender
and the proportion of adults married
does differ by gender. Still the numbers indicate that the differences in reports are largely centered among the
unmarried. This is also consistent with
Kinsey data that show high agreement
among the married on frequency of
sexual intercourse, but considerable
disagreement among the nonmarried
(Kinsey et al., 1953).

 

Social Biology

CONCLUSION

Information on sexual behavior is
important for understanding human
society in general and in particular
such facets as gender relations, sex
roles, marriage, fertility and birth control, and social networks. In addition,
the spread of AIDS and other STD’s
makes an accurate knowledge of sexual
behavior a pressing public health concern. Yet the discrepancies in the reports of men and women on number of
sexual partners raises the question
whether reliable and accurate sexual
behavior data can be collected. The
discrepant reports of men and women
on number of sex partners indicate that
great care must be taken when working
with sexual behavior data and probably
any analysis should be conducted under the assumption that either the rates
reported by men or those reported by
women might be correct. More methodological work is needed to isolate
and minimize measurement error so
that more reliable and accurate data on
sexual behavior can be collected.
