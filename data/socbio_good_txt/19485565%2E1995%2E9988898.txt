Mating Patterns of the Abbad Tribe

in Jordan

ABSTRACT: The mating patterns of the Abbad tribe in Jordan are examined based on empirical
data obtained from four male samples representing the different levels of the Abbad’s substructure as well as on nonempirical information and pedigrees collected during field work. From the
total matings in each sample, at least one-third were first-cousin marriages, and some 90 per cent
were marriages within the Abbad. The estimated inbreeding coefficient (mean F = 0.018) was
relatively high. Relatedness, geographic locality, maternal links, and the type of economy are
suggested as the factors which influenced the mating behavior of the Abbad. The study also
indicates the vital role of matings in the formation and make-up of the tribe. The Abbad tribe
could be described as an endogamic population consisting of more or less inbreeding subunits.

Arab tribes define themselves as
such, Qabila or A’shira in Arabic.
They include a diverse range of agricultural, trade, and fisher societies
alongside nomadic communities (Oppenheim, 1939, 1943; Dickson, 1951;
Lewis, 1987). Arab tribes have been
described as egalitarian, patrilineal,
segmentary, kin groups that often display complex structures, involving
many related or nonrelated agnatic
lines. The substructures of the tribe are
grouped and organized in a manner
governed by cultural and historical as
well as geographic factors (Oppenheim, 1939; Musil, 1958; Murphy and
Kasdan, 1959; Peters, 1960; Abbadi,
1986).

At any tribal level, each unit is considered to be autonomous, so that the
tribe can be understood to be ‘‘a definition of identity against other similar
units of self definition” (Lancaster and
Lancaster, 1992). According to some
authors, Arab tribes represent loose
structured political entities based on

leadership (e.g., Helm, 1968; Khoury
and Kostiner, 1990). Tapper (1990)
preferred to refer to them as “‘chiefships,’’ not as tribes.

Relationships between groups or individuals in an Arab tribe are governed
by their relatedness, i.e., genealogy.
Lancaster (1981) distinguished between two types of genealogy, macroand micro-genealogy. Macro- or formal genealogy describes the relationship between the tribal substructures in
terms of descent or as a projection of
the past, hence maintaining a framework for the tribal community as a
whole. The micro- or generative genealogy legitimates or explains present
relationships within the substructures
of the tribe.

Data on the patterns and behavior
of matings in Arab tribes are scarce.
They were provided by a few studies
that described them as endogamic
groups (Peters, 1960; Katakura, 1977;
Lancaster, 1981). Patrilateral cousin
marriages were (Murphy and Kasdan,

1959) and are the predominant mating
form, whereby second- and _thirddegree types are considered commoner
than first-cousin marriage types
(Mundy and Smith, 1990; Lancaster
and Lancaster, 1992).

The aim of the present study is to
investigate the mating structure of the
Abbad tribe in Jordan. Based on empirical and nonempirical data, factors
influencing matings as well as the role
of matings in the makeup of the tribe
are considered. The present study is intended to verify the definability of the
Abbad tribe as a breeding population.
Investigation of its genetic structure
follows.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Field work was carried out during
1986 to 1989 to obtain social, demographic, and biological data from the
Abbad tribe. Data were collected exclusively through house visits (over
600), which were arranged and attended by various contact persons from
the tribe. This arrangement provided a
state of confidence for both interviewer
and interviewed and proved to be valuable for ascertaining the relevance of
the obtained information and samples.
Previous reports on the Abbad tribe
were relatively scarce (Oppenheim,
1943; Musil, 1958; Peake, 1958) so that
additional information about the tribe
had to be gathered during the field
work phase through interviews, documents, and assays, provided by many
“genealogists” from Abbad.

To provide a comprehensive understanding of the structure of the Abbad
and to avoid linguistic discrepancies, a

Abbad Tribe

163

simplified terminology will be adopted
in the present paper to refer to the different levels of tribal structure (its relevance is limited to the present case
study). The terminology is based on
how the single agnatic lineages are organized. A tribe can include one or
more independent patrilateral “‘lineages,”” segmented into related clans.
Lineages can be arranged in “groups”
or even “subgroups.” Groups themselves can be allocated to “divisions”
or “subdivisions” (Figure 1). The
adopted “English” names for the different tribal substructures are either
based on those given by Oppenheim
(1943) or provided, in English, by
the members of the tribe, excluding
the Arabic “‘Al”’ definitive article. The
term “territory” used here refers to the
residence or concentration area of
the tribe.

THE ABBAD TRIBE

The Abbad tribe (phonetically A’bbad) resides in the Balqa district in
Jordan, in an area extending from the
Jordan valley (300 meters below sea
level) in the west to Wadi Sir, i.e., the
Sir valley, on the Jordanian eastern
heights (over 700 meters above sea
level), and from Abu-Zigan in the
north to Karama in the south (Figure
2). The Abbad’s economy was and is
primarily agricultural, and its members
are now represented in all socioeconomic and vocational levels in Jordan.

Wadi Shua’ib represents the geographical demarcation between the
Abbad’s two divisions: the northern
Abbad (Jrumiya) in the Jordan valley
and the southern Abbad (Jburiya) in
Wadi Sir and the areas surrounding the
towns of Ira and Yerga (Figure 2). The

Fic. 2.—The geographic distribution of the Abbad tribe in Jordan.

Jrumiya division includes two subdivisions, the Jrum and the Za’anif, each
consisting of six groups. The Khatalin,
Hajahja, Ma’adat, Manasir, Ramadhna, and Sanabra are allocated to
the Za’anif subdivision. The Jrum
subdivision consists of the Yasdjin,
Huwarat, A’raidha, Nua’aimat, Gha
nanim, and Sawalha groups (Figure 1).
Except for the Manasir group, each of
the Jrumiya groups consider itself to be
unilineal. The Manasir, the largest Abbad group (ca. 15,000 individuals), is
divided geographically into Manasir
Wadi-Shta, at the eastern heights, and
A’rdha Manasir in the Jordan valley

(Figures 1 and 2). The group consists of
four inclusive subgroups: the O’wana,
the Nasasra, the Asalma, and the Manajla. The last resides only in WadiShta (Figure 1). The Khatalin of the
Za’anif are the traditional chiefs of the
Abbad.

Six groups are allocated to the
Jburiya division: the Bqur, Rahamna,
Jbara, Zyadat, Fqaha, and Zyoud.
Most of these groups include a number
of lineages (Figure 2). The Bqur and
Jbara groups are considered to be the
oldest units of the Abbad. The Bqur
also represent the second level and the
Muhairat lineage of the Fqaha the
third level of the tribal leadership.

As a result of fusion and segmentation, the structure of the Abbad tribe
has been in continuous change (even to
the present time). A number of clans
once affiliated to the same group later
separated and are now building independent lineages or groups. For example, all lineages of the Fqaha were once
attached to the Muhairat lineage (Oppenheim 1943), while the Yasdjin,
A’raidha, and Nua’aimat of the Jrum
subdivision used to form a single
group. Common descent is claimed by
a number of lineages of different
groups from within the Abbad (e.g.,
A’lawin of the Zyadat group with the
A’laiwat of the Jbara group) while others are related by descent to tribal
structures outside Abbad (e.g., the
Nua’aimat and the Sakarna of the
Fqaha).

All the subunits of Abbad consider
themselves to be Yeman, i.e., of southern Arab origin. It has been suggested
that the tribe descended from the
Djutham, an ancient and ancestral
tribe of many Jordanian tribes (e.g.,
Beni-Sachr and Ajarma) (Abbadi,

Nabulsi

 

Social Biology

1986), and that many of the affiliated
groups resided in the Balqa region as
early as the third century. Some of the
present tribal subunits were explicitly
reported to have resided in Balqa
around the thirteenth century, e.g., the
Bqur (Al-Qalqashandi, 1400) and the
Nua’aimat (Hiitteroth and Abdelfattah, 1977). The history of the Abbad
tribe before the thirteenth century is
probably highly speculative.

The emergence of the present Abbad tribe from a multitude of tribal
elements occurred some 250 years ago
(Abbadi, 1986; Nabulsi, 1990), probably in a similar manner as for a number
of tribes in the area, for example, the
now widely dispersed Nua’aimat
(Al-Qalgashandi, 1400; Oppenheim,
1943), the camel-herding Rwala tribe
(Lancaster, 1981), and the BeniHassan (Tragon, 1993). Most of the
Abbad’s subunits used to be affiliated
to the Beni-Mehdi tribe, which dominated the Balqa region between the
thirteenth and the seventeenth century
(Al-Qalqashandi, 1400; Peake, 1958;
Hiitteroth and Abdelfattah, 1977). In
the middle of the seventeenth century,
the Khatalin clan, supposedly Shammar from north Arabia, joined BeniMehdi. They later repudiated the connection and together with a number of
smaller tribes and surrounding villages
formed the Abbad (Abbadi, 1986).

During the first half of the nineteenth century, the Abbad were involved in a territorial struggle with
neighboring tribes in Balqa. With the
exception of the Fqaha and Zyoud
groups, the tribe was forced to move to
Bisan in north Palestine. There, the
Abbad are said to have suffered high
child mortality as a result of diseases.
After twelve years, the tribe managed

Vol. 42, No. 3-4

to return to Balga and has resided since
then within its recent boundaries. By
the end of the nineteenth century, a
number of clans joined the Abbad
and were allocated to the Zyoud and
Fqaha. Also, a large part of the Manasir group moved from the Jordan
valley up to Wadi Shta on the southeastern borders of the Abbad’s territory (Figure 1). After Jordan’s independence in 1946, land ownership was
transferred from common wealth
(state or tribal) to private property,
and administrative changes in the infrastructures were introduced. This
process is thought to have confined the
different substructures of the Abbad to
their villages or towns, thus enhancing
the process of segmentation within the
tribe.

During the last decades, the size of
the Abbad tribe has markedly increased. Now, an estimated 120,000 individuals are affiliated to 76 agnatic
lines or units, each ranging from 250 to
more than 2,000 individuals. Population growth was variable among Abbad’s substructures. While the Fqaha
group has increased more than ten-fold
to its present estimated size by about
1850, the Jrumiya groups now number
fewer than they did before World War
II as a result of regional epidemics and
starvation during the 1940’s.

METHODS

For empirical analysis, four male
samples, representing the different levels of the Abbad’s structure, were collected (Table 1). Proportional representation of the substructures in each
sample was considered. The samples
represent the Jrumiya division, the
Jburiya division, the Manasir group,

Abbad Tribe

167

and the Sakarna lineage of the Fqaha
group (Figure 2). Sampling from the
Sakarna lineage was based on a reconstructed family tree.

The average inbreeding coefficient
(Rao, 1988) was calculated for each of
the four samples, based on parental
relatedness. As a result of complex
cross-links and overlapping generations, consanguineous marriages beyond the first-cousin level were added
as matings within the lineage. According to structural, geographic, and historical factors, three of the samples
were further subdivided to construct a
mating matrix, in order to obtain a
more detailed picture of the mating
patterns within the tribe and its substructures.

RESULTS

The rate of the various mating
types, listed in Table 2, appear to be
variable among the four Abbad samples. However, similar tendencies can
be observed. From the total matings of
each of the examined samples, at least
one-third were marriages in the firstcousin category (from 32.1 per cent in
the Manasir group to 47.3 per cent in
the Sakarna lineage). Around half of
the matings were within the paternal
descent line, and nearly 90 per cent of
the total marriages involved mates
from within the Abbad. These mating
patterns were reflected in the estimated relative inbreeding coefficients,
which were lowest in the Manasir
group (F = 0.0146) and highest in the
Sakarna lineage (F = 0.0216).

According to the mating matrix (Table 3), the rate of marriages within
each subunit was directly related to the
represented structural level, e.g., the

rate ranged from 60 per cent in the
A’widi clan of the Sakarna to 77.8 per
cent in the Jrumiya division. Matings
between the Abbad’s substructures
were observed to be unevenly distributed. In the Jrumiya division, they
tended to be restricted to mates from
within the same geographical area,
i.e., the Jordan valley. The Jburiya
groups—Bqur, Rahamna, Jbara, and
Zyadat (BRJZ in Table 3)—displayed
nearly similar geographic constrictions. In the case of the inclusive and
widely dispersed Fqaha and Zyoud
groups (FQ-ZY in Table 3), matings
beyond their relevant units were nearly
evenly distributed among Abbad’s different subunits as well as among other
neighboring populations. In general,
geographic separation appeared to
have affected matings between the Jrumiya and the Jburiya divisions, but not

 

between the Wadi-Shta and A’rdha
Manasir (Table 3, Figure 2). On the
agnatic line level, represented by the
Sakarna, matings between the A’widi
clan and the remaining Sakarna clans
were clearly less frequent (7.5 per cent
and 8.6 per cent, respectively) than
those with the Fqaha and Zyoud
groups (25 per cent and 25.7).

Exogamous matings were observed
to be more common in groups residing
on the borders of the Abbad’s territory
(e.g., 16.7 per cent in the Jrumiya division) than in those groups living
within the tribe’s heartland (e.g., 4.7
per cent in the Jburiya groups (BRJZ)
living in Mahes, Ira, and Yerqa) (Figure 1).

The descent of the Sakarna lineage
and the pedigree of some randomly selected families from the A’widi and
A’skar clans are illustrated in Figure 3.

As aresult of large family size, families
were reduced to provide better perception. Only females with known spouses
were considered in the graphic, representing less than 10 per cent of the total
family tree.

Ahmad “Al-Sakran” is the ancestral father of the Sakarna lineage. At
the turn of the nineteenth century, he
sought refuge with the Windi tribe, in
south Jordan, from which he married
his second wife. The families of Ahmad’s sons A’bdulla and A’bdulaziz,
from the first wife, moved to Balga
and settled with the Abbad as part of
the Fqaha group. From this family,
the A’skar as well as six other clans
emerged. The A’widi clan are the descendants of Ahmad’s second marriage. The integration of the Sakarna
in the Abbad was marked by frequent
intermarriages with the Fqaha group as

well as with other elements from within
the Abbad (Figure 3). This phase was
followed by an apparent increase of
patrilateral cousin marriages in the
A’skar clan and of matrilateral parallel
or cross-cousin marriages in the A’widi
clan. A pedigree analysis confirmed
these general trends in mating patterns
of the Abbad as well as the otherwise
untraceable marriages between the
Sakarna lineage and the Manasir group
(Figure 3, Table 3).

In the last two generations, the rate
of cousin as well as exogamous marriages increased (Figure 3). Furthermore, from 41 newly married individuals (age 20-25 years) affiliated to
different Abbad groups, 19 cases of
patrilateral first-degree cousin marriages, 1 case of second-cousin marriage, and 20 exogamous marriages
were registered.

DISCUSSION

The empirical observations suggest
that the mating behavior of the Abbad
tribe was primarily influenced by two
factors: relatedness and geographic locality. The rate of the mating types in
the tribe was directly related to the de
gree of relatedness between the indi
viduals involved, while tribal affiliation
and geographic distance appeared to
have affected matings between the
tribal subunits (Tables 2 and 3). The
probability for any couple to marry decreases the less related they are (starting with first-degree cousins) or -the
more distant, geographically and in
their tribal affiliation they are.

Marriages in the first-cousin category were obviously more frequent in
the Abbad than in the camel-herding
Rwala tribe (Lancaster, 1981). The frequency of consanguineous marriages
was nearly similar to the reported values in the Jordanian population (=50
per cent). Yet, the rate of direct firstcousin marriages in the Abbad (17.3
per cent) was lower than the general
estimation of 30 per cent in Jordan
(Khoury and Massad, 1992). These observations are mirrored in the lower
inbreeding coefficients in the Abbad
(mean F= 0.018), compared with
the estimated rates in the Jordanian
(F = 0.0225) and in other Arab populations (Al-Awadi et al., 1985; Hamamy et al., 1989; Khoury and Massad, 1992; Nevo et al., 1992).

The mating behavior of the rural
Abbad tribe can thus be described as
occupying a middle position between
the less sedentary and the urban populations in Jordan. This finding might
imply that the primarily agricultural
economy of the Abbad had affected its

Abbad Tribe

i

171

matings, probably to keep the land
within its groups. Similar unpublished
observations on agricultural tribal populations in Jordan (e.g., the southern
Nua’imat villages and parts of the
Beni-Hassan tribe) and in Saudi Arabia (Katakura, 1977) strengthen this
suggestion.

In Abbad, families belonging to single lineages or groups are often concentrated in one region. They are either widely dispersed over this area or
build small clusters of a few houses in
the vicinity of their cultivated land. In
time, families grow larger. Depending
on the available space, families move
to, or use, the nearest empty land, so
that the boundaries between the different groupings will intercept over time.
In this process, the families or lineages
often become involved in a process of
reciprocal matings. The resulting mating types would then depend on the
degree of relatedness between the
neighboring families.

For example, the A’skar clan, which
revealed a high incidence of patrilateral cousin marriages, resides in a relatively large fertile area in Wadi-Sir,
while the A’widi, who joined Abbad at
a later time, had to press themselves in
the available spaces in between. This
land use probably led to the observed
frequent intratribal matrilaterally influenced matings by the A’widi (Figure
2,3). The previously described matings
beyond the agnatic lines, as well as the
recent high incidence of exogamous
marriages in the Wadi-Shta Manasir
(Table 3) can be related to these
“neighborhood relationships.”

In other cases, maternal links develop between neighboring units of
different ancestry. Cross-marriages
between families would result in the

172

emergence of new settlements, in
which all members claim to be related,
or even of common descent, regardless
of their actual paternal descent (e.g.,
Mahes and Yerqa) (Figure 1). In this
sense, previous observations of the
regionally typical “‘one village, one
‘tribe’ or clan” (e.g., Gulick, 1953;
Lutffiya, 1966) probably reflect similar
situations.

Maternal links could also lead to the
segmentation of descent lines. In the
Sakarna lineage, the distinction of the
clans was enhanced by differences in
the maternal ancestry of the first generations. This segmentation was evident in the descent of each clan and not
only in the A’widi clan (Figure 3). It
might be relevant at this point to mention that some Sakarna members do
not accept their common descent with
the A’widi.

In extreme cases, subunits of the
identical ancestries were found to be
allocated to different groups in the Abbad. These subunits, traced to have
segmented in a time prior to the Abbad, were attached to different tribal
groupings with which they developed
new relationships. When these groupings became part of the Abbad, recent
relationships, achieved through maternal links, were more relevant for the
segmented elements than the older,
and often neglected, ancestral lines
(e.g., the A’lawin of the Zyadat group
and the A’laiwat of the Jbara group
from the Jburiya division) (Figure 2).

Based on his study on the Rwala
tribe, Lancaster (1981) concluded that
mating behavior in an Arab tribe is
adaptable to its necessities or viability
and influenced by the “options and assets” the matings could provide for the
individuals involved, i.e., cultural and

material continuity. Applying this concept to the Abbad, we can argue that
through first-cousin marriages, families
can maintain their share of land intact,
while matings with the surrounding
families are utilized to consolidate relationships and provide new options.

The structure of the Abbad tribe
does not follow the genealogical manner and terms observed in different
Arab tribes (e.g., Oppenheim, 1943;
Peters, 1960; Al-Nassar, 1979; Lancaster, 1981), which interpret their history and structure in not necessarily
real ancestral terms. As already mentioned, the Abbad evolved some 250
years ago from groups of different ancestry that resided in the same area and
shared the same type of agricultural
economy. The relatively young history
of the tribe did not allow the development of a genealogical reasoned structure.

Tribesmen apply genealogical terms
to describe or reason relationships
between individuals or groups. Since
genealogies are patrilateral, longstanding relations between individuals
from different ancestral lines come to
be attributed to common paternal descent. The Manasir subgroups claim
common ancestry and often describe
the relationships between the single
agnatic lines in genealogical terms.
Before joining the Abbad, matings between Manasir lineages were reportedly very common so that they became
highly interrelated and had to be integrated as a single unit in the newly
formed tribe.

We might speculate that the structure of the Abbad tribe would have attained the same genealogical design
observed in other Arab tribes had it
emerged 200 years earlier. In the early

stage of Abbad’s history, matings between the different subunits were very
common. According to pedigree analysis, the entry of the ancestors of the
A’skar and the A’widi clans in Abbad
was marked by intermarriages with the
Fqaha group, to which they were allocated, and with other units from Abbad (Figure 3). Information submitted
by other units indicate similar conditions in their pedigrees.

In the absence of common ancestry,
the mating behavior of the diverse
elements that formed the Abbad may
be interpreted as a way to provide a
common denominator or cause, upon
which their unity can rest. This process
must be seen in the light of the hard
conditions, natural and man-made, in
which the people of the area lived
from the seventeenth century until
the 1950’s (Peake, 1958; Lewis, 1987).
Translated into biological terms, one
can understand the mating behavior
of the involved tribal elements, at this
early stage, as a method to increase the
effective size of the population i.e., the
number of reproductive individuals, to
ensure their survival.

In contrast, a military alliance between Abbad and the Beni-Sachr tribe
was formed in the nineteenth century
and lasted some twenty years. During
this period, no matings between the
tribes were reported. These facts

strengthen the role of intratribal matings in the make-up of the Abbad tribe.
Hence, the description of Arab tribes
as political entities (Tapper, 1990) does
not hold, at least for the Abbad tribe.

To summarize, the Abbad tribe can
be seen as an endogamic population
consisting of more or less inbred subunits. The unity of the tribe is achieved
by past and present relationships. To
be related, individuals have to intermarry. Relatedness, maternal links,
geography, and the type of economy
were the factors that affected the mating behavior of the tribe, the same factors that influenced the tribe’s makeup
and organization. Mating can thus be
understood as vital in the constitution
of Arab tribes.
