Brief Reports

Family Configuration and Family Size

ABSTRACT: In a sample of 61,829 families, the probability of having an additional child is
higher in those families with all children of the same sex as compared to those families with
children of both sexes. In addition, families with only boys were more likely to have an

additional child than families with all girls.

There is disagreement on the influence of family configuration on family
size. Several studies report that parents
are more likely to have additional children if all of their children are of the
same sex than if they have children of
both sexes (Fancher, 1956; Gray, 1972;
Gray and Morrison, 1974; Loyd and
Gray, 1969; Thomas, 1948), whereas
others report family sizes to be invariant
over various configurations (Ayala and
Falk, 1971; Waller, 1976). The lack of
agreement may be partially due to the
small sample sizes used in these studies.

This paper reports a test of the hypothesis with an adequate sample size.
The data are on the families of the
794,598 American high school students
who took the National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test in 1965 (Breland,
1973). All of the families with three
(n = 45,089) and four (” = 16,740) children were selected for analysis.

RESULTS

The expected number of children for
a given family configuration is based
on the relative frequencies in Table 1.
For example, the probability that a
third-born subject will have two elder
brothers is p = 0.2441; two elder sisters,
p = 0.2459; and a brother/sister combination, p = 0.51. The various probabili

ties were multiplied by the total number
of third-born children in families with
three children to obtain the expected
frequencies for each configuration.
Analogous procedures were used for
the four-child families.

The resulting expected frequencies
along with the observed frequencies are
presented in Table 2. Separate analyses
for both family sizes yielded similar
results, so a combined analysis is reported here. Table 2 reveals that families with children all of the same sex produce many more additional children
than expected, whereas the reverse is
true for families with children of both
sexes; y?(2) = 1100.888, p<0.001.
Whereas this value is highly significant,
with N = 61,829, the mean square contingency coefficient is only 0.0009, indicating that less than 1 per cent of the varlance in family size is explained by family
configuration.

Table 2 also demonstrates that the sex
of same-sex antecedent children is reJated to family size. If the first two or
three children were boys, the parents are

much more likely to have another child
than was the case when the first
children were girls, ,*(1)=
148.019, p < 0.0001.

The size of the sample makes these
results unequivocal for the population
involved. The population involved,
however, is restricted to the United
States and is clearly biased in favor of
white middle-class families. The results
should thus not be generalized to other
populations, particularly in developing
countries.
