A Vasectomy Service in a Free-standing
Family Planning Center: One Year’s

Experience

Margaret Sanger Research Bureau
New York, New York

Vasectomy, the male sterilization operation, is becoming a very popular form of
birth control in the United States. In 1960
an estimated 40,000 Americans underwent
the operation; the figure is now approaching
one million a year.

The first outpatient Vasectomy Service in
America was opened in October, 1969, at
the Margaret Sanger Research Bureau, Inc.
This was the first voluntary male sterilization clinic set up as an integral part of a
family planning service in a center that has
offered other family planning services for
fifty years. The service at the Sanger Bureau has served as a model for a number
of similar services that have since spread
all over the country in the past three years,
and it has clearly demonstrated patients’
interest in and acceptance of this method of
birth control. At present, vasectomy is
being performed at 129 clinics, 153 hospitals, and countless doctors’ offices.

ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY

The Vasectomy Service at the Sanger
Bureau was established as a demonstration
project to show that there is acceptance of
this method of birth control by the public
and that a large demand goes unmet because of presumed legal restrictions, the

unavailability of services, or the unwillingness of doctors to perform the procedure.
The guiding principle of the Vasectomy
Service was to make service the primary
objective, with research and training secondary.

ELIGIBILITY

There are no legal restrictions in the
United States for performing voluntary
sterilization in male or female adults seeking the operation. However, the Sterilization
Subcommittee of the Bureau’s Medical and
Scientific Committee, which is composed of
urologists, psychiatrists, and other medical
persons, originally developed the following
criteria—which have since been considerably modified—to guide the Service in processing applicants: ‘““The candidate must be
at least 25 years old, married or in a stable
relationship; he must have at least three
children if less than 40 years old, two children if he is 40-45 years old, one child if
46-50 years old, and if over 50 he is eligible
without any children.” However, proceeding
under the leadership of our Board of Directors, who recommended that “patients
be accepted for Vasectomy Service in terms
of the needs of the individual family with
the understanding that the doctor’s judg

304 Sobrero et al.

ment is paramount,” the decision to approve
the operation for candidates not fully meeting those basic criteria has been left to the
Director of the Bureau in consultation with
the psychiatric interviewer and the surgeon.

OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE

Persons making initial inquiries are sent
a brochure explaining the procedure and
answering the questions most commonly
asked, and an application form. After the
completed application is received and processed, an appointment is made for an initial interview and presurgical medical
evaluation.

At the initial medical interview, the
couple are seen together, and separately if
indicated. At this time, the procedure is
explained and the candidate’s eligibility is
determined. The irreversibility of the procedure, the possibility of death of children,
remarriage, and possible desire for return to
fertility, and the physical effects on the
male, and emotional effects on the husband
and wife, are discussed.

The medical evaluation includes medical
interview, physical examination, semen
analysis, blood studies, and urinalysis.
Every effort is made to complete the interview and the presurgical medical evaluation
in a single visit. Appointments for surgery
are scheduled not less than two weeks after
the medical evaluation.

The Bureau requires two azoospermic
postoperative semen specimens before a
letter of confirmation is sent informing the
patient that other methods of contraception
may be discontinued. The need for continued use of contraceptive measures until the
final confirmation of azoospermia is stressed.

Vasectomies are performed once a week,
on Fridays only, with patients scheduled for
morning or afternoon sessions, up to ten per
session. The actual surgery is performed
under local anesthesia. The removed segments of the vas deferens are stored in

Social Biology

separate properly identified fixative bottles.
If postoperative semen specimens repeatedly
show the presence of live sperm, the vas
segments are then sent to the Bureau’s
pathologist for evaluation, and if necessary
the operation is repeated.

During the first year of the Service, 6
failures to sever one of the vasa deferentia
occurred (a surgical failure rate of 2.5%),
4 of them in clients operated upon by physicians in training, 2 by general surgeons
not urologists. Four of these clients were
successfully reoperated; two declined the
reoperation (final surgical failure rate,
0.85%).

Postoperatively, the patient is given
written and oral instructions and provided
with a suspensory. Medication may be prescribed on an individual basis at the discretion of the surgeon.

SERVICE AND TRAINING EXPERIENCE

From the inception of the Vasectomy
Service at the Bureau until June 30, 1972,
1,426 procedures were performed, 236 of
them in the first year through September,
1970. The Service was originally designed
to perform a maximum of 500 operations a
year, or roughly 10 operations a week.

The Vasectomy Service facilities at the
Bureau have been utilized for training in
surgical technique of 65 domestic and foreign physicians, as well as for training of
a number of family planning workers in
administrative aspects and interviewing
techniques. The policies, procedures, and
forms have been widely distributed and
utilized as guides by other services.

ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST
YEAR CLIENTS

In November, 1971, a questionnaire was
mailed to the first 236 consecutive clients
who had had the operation during the
period October, 1969, through September,
1970. Eighty per cent of the clients (189)
Vol. 20, No. 3

replied to the first mailing, which, considering the time elapsed since the surgery and
the extent of the questionnaire (10 pages),
represents an excellent degree of patient response, presumably also reflecting the rapport established between Bureau staff and
Vasectomy Service clients.

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CLIENTS

The mean age of the vasectomized men
at the time of operation was 38.4 years, and
“the median, 39 years. Nearly two-thirds of
the men were between 30 and 45 years of
‘age, The wives were on an average 3.6 years
Fyounger than their husbands at the time
@vhen their husbands accepted vasectomy.
oo Except for three men who had no chilGren but still wanted to have a vasectomy,
“the range of children was from one to eight.
‘The mean number of living children of ac<feptors was 3.3, and the median was 3.4
Shildren.
= Nearly 88% of the men were white; the
‘Stemainder included blacks and others.
‘About 38% of the men were Catholic, 28%
£Protestant, about 18% Jewish, and the re“mainder divided between “other faiths” and
‘S‘no religion.” The large percentage of
“Catholics suggests that the influence of
‘eligious doctrine on an individual’s deci“Sion in the matter of birth control or steril§zation has been decreasing in recent years.
‘€ The men who elected vasectomy were
ighly educated. The average number of
school years attended for vasectomized men
was 13.8. In terms of occupation, about
58% of the men were in professional, managerial, or technical occupations, while
about 19% were skilled workers. In other
occupational categories, such as clerical,
sales, semiskilled, and unskilled workers,
the percentage varied from about 5% to
7%.
The median weekly income of the vasectomized men was about $232. About 28%
of the men had a weekly family income of

over $300; only about 5% indicated a
weekly family income of less than $100,

complications such as small hematoma,
bleeding, or infection. About 14% had subjective complaints such as pain, swelling,
discomfort, oozing, or a combination thereof,
which were expected as part of the normal
healing process.

The results of a followup survey one to
two years after surgery showed that postoperative complications in most cases were
mild, requiring no specific treatment and
little or no absenteeism. Of the respondents
in the followup survey, only two cases had
serious complications which persisted for a
long time after the surgery; one of them
had developed epididymitis, and the other

an infectious necrosis of part of the superficial layers of the scrotal skin, which healed
after local debridement and antibiotic therapy without compromising any other structure.

Presser (1970) in a world view report
had reported a wide range of complication
rates among studies done in different parts
of the world, varying from 0.0% to 80.0%.
While commenting on this extreme variability, she points out that this might be
attributed to the broad interpretations of
morbidity by the patient and by the
physician. In order to draw any definite
conclusion about postoperative complaints
and complications, more rigorously designed
followup studies are needed.

TIME TO REACH AZOOSPERMIA

It is important to stress that male sterility
is not accomplished upon completion of the
surgery, and that contraceptive measures
should be continued until azoospermia is
confirmed by postoperative semen analyses.
To neglect to advise the clients properly
about this point may result in very embarrassing and distressing situations.

The distribution of vasectomized men by
time to reach azoospermia is shown in
Table 2. Although most of the men (about
71%) became sterile within three months,

Social Biology

about 7% continued to show motile sperm
in their ejaculates for more than six months.
The average number of days to reach azoospermia works out to be 80 days.

No attempt was made to correlate the
occurrence of azoospermia with the total
number of postoperative ejaculates; this
may account for the apparent discrepancy
with the findings of Freund and Davis
(1969).

SUMMARY

The experience in establishing the first
outpatient Vasectomy Service as an integral
part of a family planning service in a center
that has offered other family planning services for fifty years is summarized. Administration and policy, eligibility and operational procedure are presented. Analysis of
the 236 clients operated upon during the
first year of operation as well as the results
of an inquiry into the patients’ reactions to
the surgery one to two years after it was
performed show that the nature of postoperative complications in the 189 respondents (80%) is generally mild, requiring
no specific treatment and little or no absenteeism in the population studied. There
were only two complications requiring absence from work. The surgical failure rate
was 2.5% (6 cases); four cases were re
