Mormon Fertility Through Half a

Century: Another Test of the
Americanization Hypothesis

Religion has long been recognized as an
important influence on fertility. A report
based on the Princeton Fertility Study
(Westoff et al., 1963), for example, found
religious preference to be a better predictor
than all other major social variables of a
couple’s fertility.

In light of the demonstrated importance
of this variable in fertility research, it becomes important to note that a substantial
body of literature on religion in America
today has documented a trend toward
“secularization” in American life and has
pointed to the erosion of traditional
religious beliefs and influence in certain
denominations (for example, Glock and
Stark, 1965).

In an attempt to investigate this secularization phenomenon with regard to influence on fertility, Judith Blake (1966)
examined the “Americanization” of Catholic reproductive ideals. Blake used statements and publications of the Catholic
clergy to demonstrate what this group
considered the ideal number of children
for their membership. Then, comparing
the stated fertility ideals of Catholics to
the clergy’s ideal and to the ideals of other

Americans, Blake concluded that the fertility ideals of Catholics were really more
like those held by other Americans than
like the reproductive ideals of the Catholic
clergy.

This analysis is important for students
of fertility, and of religion as well. Unfortunately, it has not been applied to other
religious groups. Further, it would seem
that such an analysis would be strengthened
if behavioral measures could be substituted
for the attitudinal measures used by Blake.
It is possible that members of religious
groups may express ideals at variance with
those of their religious leaders but eventually behave in accordance with the norms
set by the church.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints, or Mormon church, is another
religious group, like Catholics, with a high
fertility tradition. The state of Utah, site
of the church headquarters and with 71.3
per cent of its population claimed as members by the Mormon church,! had the

highest crude birth rate of any state in the
nation in 1970 at 25.9.?

It is the purpose of this paper to test
the “Americanization” hypothesis for this
religious group. Specifically we will (1) examine the literature of the Mormon church
to ascertain the reproductive ideals of
Mormon leaders for their membership,
and (2) examine the actual birth rates of
Mormons from 1920 to 1970 in comparison
with the birth rates of all Americans, Utah

residents, and the ideals of church leaders.

THE VIEW OF MORMON LEADERS

The position of the Mormon church on

A fertility-related matters, and particularly
eon the use of contraceptive techniques,
S has been thoroughly documented by HastOm,
coings et al., (1972). These authors examined
= the theological and historical supports for
=the church position and looked at the acSoceptance of contraceptive usage among
‘S various samples of Mormons, We shall
= review here only the major points of their
S analysis.
In general, the position of the Mormon
Ochurch is a pronatalist one. Historical
reasons for this view include the manner
in which the Mormon church began.
© Mormons migrated to the Salt Lake City
2 Basin in the mid-nineteenth century to
avoid religious persecution. High fertility
= was considered important since they were
& faced with a frontier existence where much
human labor was required in order to
survive.

Secondly, the practice of polygamy contributed to high fertility. During the early
days of the church, “statements against
polygamous marriages or favoring fertility
limitation were treated as synonymous”
(Hastings et al., 1972, p. 20).

Fertility 71
The practice of polygamy was the expressed basis for much of the hostility
directed against the Mormons, and antipolygamy laws, specifically the EdmundsTucker Act of 1887, made polygamy a very
difficult practice to maintain. On September
25, 1890, the church President, Wilford
Woodruff, wrote the following manifesto
to the members (Mullen, 1966, p. 191):

Inasmuch as laws have been enacted by
Congress forbidding plural marriages, which
laws have been pronounced constitutional
by the court of last resort, I hereby declare
my intention to submit to those laws, and
to use my influence with the members of the
Church over which I preside to have them
do likewise.

While this manifesto was generally supported by the membership, some did migrate to Mexico rather than abandon the
practice. Although polygamy was not continued in new marriages, the established
families were not broken up. Adherence to
the new doctrine against plural marriage
was given support by the membership and
violation of this doctrine is one of the few
reasons for excommunication within the
Mormon church.

Theological supports for high fertility
include the literal acceptance of the biblical
injunction in Gen. 1:28 to “Be fruitful
and multiply, replenish the earth, and subdue it.”

This injunction is but one aspect of the
theological reasoning. Mormons accept the
belief of the pre-existence of spirits and
during the temporal existence “the faithful
Mormon shares the sacred responsibility
of offering these spirits the best possible
hope for progress toward perfectibility and
exaltation, experienced in a mortal state by
membership in a ‘good’ Mormon family”
(Hastings et al., 1972, p. 21).

With such a belief system, it is not surprising that birth control is frowned upon,
and according to Ezra Taft Benson (1969a,
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

42, Spicer and Gustavus

p. 12), a member of the Quorum of the
Twelve Apostles:%

The world teaches birth control. Tragically, many of our sisters subscribe to its
pills and practices when they could easily
provide earthly tabernacles for more of our
Father’s children. We know that every spirit
assigned to this earth will come, whether
through us or someone else. There are
couples in the Church who think they are
getting along just fine with their limited
families but who will someday suffer the
pains of remorse when they meet the spirits
that might have been part of their posterity.

Further, the emphasis on family life
among Mormons is quite strong. Benson
(19695, p. 21) has said:

It has been truly stated that “salvation
is a family affair . . . and that the family
unit is the most important organization in
time or in eternity.”

The Church was created in large measure
to help the family, and long after the Church
has performed its mission, the celestial
patriarchal order will still be functioning.
This is why President Joseph F. Smith said:
“To be a successful father or a successful
mother is greater than to be a successful
general or a successful statesman... ,” and
President McKay added: ‘When one puts
business or pleasure above his home, he, that
moment, starts on the downgrade to soul
weakness.”

Oftentimes, David O. McKay, (1969,
p. 9), late church President, has spoken
on the sacredness and the purpose of marriage and family.

Marriage is a sacred relationship entered
into for purposes that are well recognized—
primarily for the rearing of a family ....
Teaching the young of both sexes in the
responsibilities and ideals of marriage so
that they may realize that marriage involves
obligation and is not an arrangement to be
terminated at pleasure. Teach them that
pure love between the sexes is one of the
noblest things on earth, and the bearing

has become the new Prophet-Seer-Revelator upon
the death of the church President.

Social Biology

and rearing of children the highest of all
human duties.

In addition, there is a general admonition
against the use of birth control devices.
In 1969, the President of the church,
David O. McKay, wrote:

We seriously regret that there should
exist a sentiment or feeling among all members of the Church to curtail the birth of
their children. We have been commanded
to multiply and replenish the earth that we
may have joy and rejoicing in our posterity.

Where husband and wife enjoy health and
vigor and are free from impurities that
would be entailed upon their posterity, it
is contrary to the teachings of the Church
artificially to curtail or prevent the birth of
children. We believe that those who practice
birth control will reap disappointment by
and by.

However, we feel that men must be considerate of their wives who bear the greater
responsibility not only of bearing children,
but of caring for them through childhood.
To this end the mother’s health and strength
should be conserved and the husband’s
consideration for his wife is his first duty,
and self-control a dominant factor in all
their relationships,*

The historical and theological bases,
strengthened by the emphasis on family
life, thus provide strong supports for
Mormon couples to maintain high levels
of fertility. However, the definition of what
constitutes sufficient fertility for the good
Mormon couple is not explicitly stated.

On one occasion, President McKay noted
(Hastings et al., 1972, p. 22):

Marriage is for the purpose of rearing a
family, and now is the time to do it. I admire those young mothers with four or five
children around them now, still young and
happy.

At another time, however, we find
Melvin J. Ballard, a Mormon apostle, say
4 This letter dated April 14, 1969, was addressed
to presidents of stakes, bishops of wards and
presidents of missions. According to Hastings,
et al. (1972, p. 25), “instructions to local officials
accompanying this epistle were to use personal
discretion in offering advice to members.”

ing to a mother after the birth of her
eighth child (Hastings et al., 1972, p. 24):

Now Sister . . . we must preserve our
strength to care for our children. It isn’t
expected that we should bring children in
to the world at the detriment of our health,
such that we can’t care for the ones we already have.

The leaders of the Mormon church are
not expected to practice celibacy as are the
clergy of the Catholic church. Since no
clear, ideal family size emerged from the
writings of church leaders, it was felt that
an examination of the number of children
born to the church Presidents might indicate some pattern. Four men served as
church President from 1920 to 1970. They
were, in order, Heber J. Grant (5 children),
George Albert Smith (3 children), David
O. McKay (7 children), and Joseph Fielding Smith (11 children).® Again, no clear
guideline is given.

The ideal number of children for the
“good” Mormon family is thus obscure
and apparently should vary in the eyes of
the church leaders with emotional and
physical circumstances. However, these
circumstances apparently should not include such secular considerations as economics, preferred lifestyles, or political
events. According to Elder Ezra Taft
Benson (1969a, p. 12):

The first commandment given to man was
to multiply and replenish the earth with
children. That commandment has never been
altered, modified, or cancelled. The Lord
did not say to multiply and replenish the

earth if it is convenient, or if you are
wealthy, or after you have gotten your

schooling, or when there is peace on earth,

or until you have four children. The Bible
says, “lo, children are an heritage of the

Lord: . . . Happy is the man that hath his
quiver full of them .
If an ideal number of children is not explicit, the admonition for consistently high
fertility is made quite clear.

MORMON FERTILITY

In the face of such strong religious supports for high fertility, what are Mormons
actually doing in comparison to other
Americans? Since the required number of
children is not clear, how is this injunction
to have many children translated by the
Mormon couple? We turn to an examination of Mormon crude birth rates between
1920 and 1970 in order to answer this
question.

The data on Mormon fertility were obtained from the Historical Department of
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints. The crude birth rates include worldwide church membership, and information
is not currently available which separates
these rates for the United States population
only, However, the majority of the Mormon
membership outside the United States is
found in developed nations with a Western
tradition.

The Mormon birth rates are computed
from membership rolls. Membership records are made when a child is blessed
(O-1 years) or when a convert is baptized
(age 12 or over). If an infant dies before
being blessed, a membership record is
automatically filed unless one of the parents
is non-Mormon and objects to having the
child placed on the membership rolls.

The church population as of December
31, 1967 (Table 1) was 2,615,744. However, the data on distribution of these
members will be based on the subtotal
figure of 2,351,582 as information for those
members in the “lost and unknown” and
“in transit” categories is not known.®

Eighty-one per cent of the Mormon
church membership in 1967 resided in the
United States. Of the United States membership, 38.4 per cent was found in Utah.
The vast majority of all United States
Mormons (83.7 per cent) are located in
the Western United States, with the top
ten states in membership totals being Utah,
California, Idaho, Arizona, Washington,
Oregon, Nevada, Texas, Colorado, and
Wyoming,

It is recognized that crude birth rates
do not take into account different age
distributions of populations, thus limiting
their usefulness in comparative studies.
Nevertheless, they are used here due to
lack of age-specific fertility data for the
Mormon population.

Table 2 provides the crude birth rates
for Mormons, Utah residents, and the
United States population at five-year intervals from 1920 to 1970.

It is clear that Mormons have had
higher birth rates throughout this period

total membership figures was obtained during a
personal interview on May 19, 1971 with Mr.
Charles Kleinman, Presiding Bishoprics’ Office,
Membership Department, Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City, Utah.

than either Utah residents or the population of the United States. While this ordering of the three populations with regard to
the level of the birth rates was to be
expected, the very great similarity in the
pattern of the birth rate among the three
populations is rather striking. These data
are presented graphically in Figure 1.

All three populations show a decline in
the birth rate from 1920 through the
Depression. In 1935, the rate started to
go up once again, with a sharp increase
during the post-World War II “baby
boom.”

This upward trend peaked for all three
populations in the mid-1950’s. There was
then a rapid drop in the birth rates until
1965, at which time both the Mormon and
Utah birth rates increased. The United

States birth rate continued to decline, but
at a slower rate. This latter period represents the “baby boom” babies coming into
the childbearing ages, a phenomenon which
would have a greater impact on the crude
birth rate among the younger Mormon
population than among the United States
population as a whole.

Through all of these increases and declines, the difference in the Mormon and
United States birth rates has been remarkably stable. In 1920, this difference was
10.3, and in 1970 it was 10.2. The difference in these two birth rates was greatest
in 1950 and least in 1925,

“should” have according to their leaders,
it is clear that the church generally supports high fertility. However, examination
of Mormon versus United States birth
rates, has indicated that Mormon couples
have apparently been responsive in planning their families to the same sets of
circumstances that have influenced other
Americans during this period, namely, economic depressions, wars, prosperity, etc.
This finding is consonant with the data
presented by Hastings et al. (1972) showing increased acceptance of birth control.
In this sense, we might conclude that
Mormon fertility behavior has indeed been
responsive to secular influences.

On the other hand, Mormons have also
shown extreme consistency in having more
children than other Americans are having.
The increase in Mormon and Utah birth
rates from 1965 to 1970 may have been
influenced by the exhortations of church
leaders during this time, as well as by the
entrance of the “baby boom” babies into
the highly fertile period. It may be that
the layman’s interpretation of “being fruitful and multiplying” is “having more
children than other people are having.”

Social Biology

It is interesting that this similarity in
patterns is obtained even though we have
used crude birth rates to make this comparison. The mechanism by which such
consistency is maintained is, of course,
not examined by these data.

Non-Mormon neighbors may serve as a
reference group for Mormon couples in
planning their fertility to exceed that of
others. A general family-size norm of the
Western culture, learned through mass
media and mass education, may serve as
such a reference point. General approval
for given numbers of children may be
communicated more subtly to Mormon
couples by their leaders than through written publications. Each of these explanations
and many others are possible for the observed patterns. They should certainly be
examined.
