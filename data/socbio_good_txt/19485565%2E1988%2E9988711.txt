Inbreeding Among Endogamous Groups
in Three Multicaste Villages
of Srikakulam District, Andhra Pradesh, India

ABSTRACT: In the present paper 702 families have been studied belonging to different endogamous groups in three multicaste villages of Srikakulam District, Andhra Pradesh. It is observed that 33.76 per cent of families are consanguineous marriages. With regard to the types
of marriages, 12.11 per cent are uncle-niece; 14.10 per cent are matrilateral cross-cousins;
5.84 per cent are patrilateral cross-cousins; 0.57 per cent are first cousins once removed, and
1.14 per cent are second cousins. There are only six couples (0.86 per cent) in intercaste marriages. The coefficient of inbreeding for autosomal and sex-linked genes, 0.045 and 0.059,
respectively, for Chakalis which are higher than Kalingas (F = 0.03; F1 = 0.038), Segidis
(F = 0.031; F1 = 0.041), Velamas (F = 0.026; F1 = 0.036), Vysyas (F = 0.027;
Fi = 0.034), Malas (F = 0.017; F1 = 0.026), and others (F = 0.026; F1 = 0.032). The ttests for mean marriage distances are statistically significant among all castes, but chisquares for intergroup difference of consanguineous and nonconsanguineous marriages are
statistically significant only among Kalingas and Chakalis, Vysyas and Chakalis, and Malas

and Chakalis.

The high rates of consanguineous
marriages among the populations of
Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have
been extensively documented (Dronam
Raju and Meera Khan, 1963; Centerwall and Centerwall, 1966; Sanghvi,
1966; Murty and Jamil, 1972; Rao and
Inbaraj, 1977, 1979, 1980). Studies in
many parts of the world have shown a
significant decline in the frequency of
consanguineous marriages (Pohlman,
1951; Deraemacker, 1958; Blanco and
Chakraborty, 1975, etc.). However, in
South India over the past few decades
consanguineous marriages have not declined significantly (Andhra Pradesh:
Dronam Raju and Meera Khan, 1963;
Sanghvi, 1966; Chakravartti, 1968;

Reid, 1973; Veerraju, 1973; Roychoudhury, 1976; Rami Reddy and
Papa Rao, 1978a, b; Papa Rao and
Rami Reddy, 1983; Venu Gopal Rao
and Murty, 1984; Chengal Reddy, 1984.
Tamil Nadu: Centerwall and Centerwall, 1966; Srinivasan and Mukherjee, 1976; Rao and Inbaraj, 1977; and
Roychoudhury, 1978. Karnataka: Roychoudhury, 1976. Kerala: Ali, 1968, and
Kumar et al., 1967).

Since the South Indian populations
are known to have practiced various
types of consanguineous marriages for
centuries, they provide an excellent opportunity for studying the genetic effects
of inbreeding. The present study is
aimed at understanding the pattern of

consanguinity and levels of inbreeding
in different ethnic groups (Kalingas, Segidis, Velamas, Vysyas, Malas, Chakalis) and other castes (including Jangam,
Patnaik, Viswa Brahmin, Dammala,
Kapu and Neyyala) from three villages
in Andhra Pradesh in South India.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data were collected from three
multicaste villages of Ambeerupeta,
Susaram, and Dandulakshmipuram in
Narasannapeta taluk, Srikakulam District, Andhra Pradesh (Figure 1). There
are altogether 702 families which include 210 Kalingas, 96 Segidis, 102 Ve
 

lamas (agriculturists); 65 Vysyas (traders), 80 Malas, (farm laborers), 52
Chakalis (washermen); 97 other castes
which include 28 Jangams (bards/folk
musicians), 30 Patnaiks (village accountants), 10 Viswa Brahmins (blacksmiths), 11 Dammalas (agriculturists),
16 Kapus (agriculturists) and 2 Neyyalas
(small businessmen).

Information on different types of
consanguineous marriages was ascertained from respondent families and village elders. The distance between the
birth places of spouses, called marriage
distance, was estimated in kilometers.
The coefficient of inbreeding F and Fl
was calculated according to Wright
(1922).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Various consanguineous and nonconsanguineous (including caste exogamous) marriages with their percentages
are presented in Table 1. It shows that
out of 702 families studied, 12.11 per
cent of marriages are of uncle-niece,
14.10 per cent are of matrilateral crosscousins, 5.84 per cent are of patrilateral
cross-cousins, 0.57 per cent are of first
cousins once removed, and the remaining 1.14 per cent are of second cousins.
The type of consanguinity by caste and
coefficient of inbreeding are reproduced
in Table 2.

It can be seen from Table 2 that the
overall rate of consanguinity is high
among Chakalis (50 per cent) compared
to other caste groups (Kalingas, 34.29
per cent; Segidis, 37.50 per cent; Velamas, 35.29 per cent; Vysyas, 29.24 per
cent, Malas, 25.00 per cent; and others,
28.86 per cent). The coefficient of inbreeding for autosomal and sex-linked
genes, 0.045 and 0.059, respectively, for
Chakalis which are higher than Kalingas
(F = 0.030 and F1 = 0.038), Segidis

ENDOGAMY

All the marriages (99.14 per cent),
except 1 out of the 96 among the Segidis,
2 among 80 Malas, 1 out of 52 Chakalis,
and 2 among 11 Dammalas have been
concentrated between individuals belonging to the respective division of the
same community. Only 6 exogamous
marriages (0.86 per cent) have taken
place among the men and women of the
different castes (Table 1). These exogamous unions indicate a small amount of
gene flow from one caste population to
another caste. The admixture is rather

insignificant from the point of view of
identifying the populations as endogamous units. Such small exceptions to endogamy can obviously be expected to
occur in all populations and does not
provide sufficient evidence against considering these caste populations as
breeding isolates. It is reasonable to expect a similarly small degree of admixture among other caste populations if
more data on marriages were available
for them.

It may be noted that the exogamous
marriages have not occurred between
any pair of the populations under study
and thus it can be assumed that the
twelve castes (See Table 2) inhabiting
these villages satisfy Wright’s island
model (Wright, 1969).

Another factor which contributes to
the breeding and genetic isolation
within each of these populations is a
high incidence of matings between
closely related individuals, whose frequency for all castes in three multicaste
villages ranges from 25 per cent to 50 per
cent. Their poor economy and preference for mates within kin groups are
some of the reasons for the higher incidence of consanguinity.

ISOLATION BY MARRIAGE DISTANCE

Although the twelve groups of populations have been treated as breeding
isolates, the wide area of continuous distribution of these populations calls for
an investigation into the nature and extent of the geographical breeding isolation within each of these three village
populations. For this purpose, the data
on distance between the birth place of
spouses (called marriage distance) have
been analyzed (Table 3). The Kalingas
show a low mean marriage distance of
9.25 + 0.97 kms. while Vysyas score a
higher mean distance of 31.23 + 4.98
kms. The Segidis, Velamas, Malas,
Chakalis, and others have a mean marriage distance that ranges from 11.64 to
28.17 kms. The low value for the Kalinga may be due to higher density of this
population in the neighboring villages.
Because of these low mean marriage
distances in these populations, groups of
populations within each division are isolated by distance and form small overlapping Mendelian populations, approaching a stepping stone model with
continuous variation of genetic traits between adjacent groups of people.
