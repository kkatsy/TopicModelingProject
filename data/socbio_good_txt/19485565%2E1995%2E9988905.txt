causes via the known general mortality.

The study of mortality by causes of
death plays a very important role in
the design of health intervention programs as well as in decision making
>, in terms of priorities for health care ac— tion. In many African countries mortality statistics themselves are incomplete; statistics on causes of death are
rarely available. Where they are available (mostly in urban areas), their reliability and their representativeness in
reflecting the national pattern of cause
of death are questionable. The exceptions to the above are few.

Faced with such problems of data
constraints, researchers have developed a host of techniques for the purpose of obtaining conventional data
using unconventional means. These
techniques, otherwise known as “‘indirect estimation techniques,” have been
applied to the estimation of infant and

ABSTRACT: This paper is a critical assessment of techniques used for the estimation of cause of
death structure in Africa in the light of contemporary theories of mortality. The technique mostly
used for the indirect estimation of cause of death structure is based on the mortality experience
in Western countries. With the marked differences in the epidemiologic transition experienced
in Western countries and those being experienced in African countries, it is not very likely that
an estimation of cause of death structure based on data from the former can accurately estimate
cause of death structure in the latter. This argument is supported in the paper through a
comparison of observed estimates of cause of death structure for some African populations with
indirect estimates. It is proposed that a better approach is to use a residual method whereby one
proceeds from nearly true estimates of cause of death rates to obtain estimates for unknown

child mortality, adult mortality, and
maternal mortality among others. Recently, indirect estimation techniques
have been extended to the analysis of
causes of death. As these techniques
are developed, they are evaluated, and
if found to be valid, they are subsequently applied to developing countries where the results obtained from
their application assist in decision
making.

The simplest way to validate the
performance of these techniques is to
compare their estimates with the observed values. In the absence of observed values, the evaluation of these
indirect techniques becomes problematic. It is against this background that
this article is written. As cause-ofdeath data in Africa are very scarce,
the validation of the techniques for the
indirect estimation of cause-of-death

structure cannot be a straightforward
matter.

The starting point for the indirect
estimation of cause-of-death structure
is recognition of the linear relationship
between overall mortality and causespecific mortality. This relationship
was first documented in the work of
Preston and Nelson (1974) based
largely on data from European populations. It has since been replicated by
other researchers, such as Palloni and
Wyrick (1981) using Latin American
data, and by Bah (1992) using Mauritian data.

The problem arises when the linear
model derived from those populations
studied is extended to other populations for the purpose of estimating
their cause-of-death structure. Is the
practice viable, or not? Using Omran’s
(1982) theory of the epidemiological
transition, one can reason both ways.
The theory “focuses on the complex
changes in pattern of health and disease in a society and on their demographic, socioeconomic and biological
determinants and consequences” (Omran, 1982). It proposes that disease
patterns shift over time so that infectious and parasitic diseases are gradually, but not completely, displaced by
degenerative and man-made diseases
as the leading causes of death.

According to the theory, the transition consists of three major successive
stages: the stage of pestilence and
famine with life expectancy at birth of
20—40 years; the stage of receding pandemic with life expectancy at birth of
30-55 years; and the stage of degenerative and man-made diseases with
life expectancy at birth of 70 years or
more. The theory further proposes
four models of the epidemiological

Social Biology

transition: the classical or Western
model; the accelerated variant of the
classical model; the delayed model;
and the transitional variant of the delayed model.

Based on this theory, one would argue that the causes-of-death structure
would be largely determined by life
expectancy (and corresponding to
the crude death rate). This approach is
an evolutionary one which assumes
that the progression from the stage of
pestilence and famine to that of degenerative diseases is a linear one. As
such, it would seem that the regression
model developed using data from
Western countries (which have undergone all the stages of the epidemiologic
transition) would be applicable to developing countries which are undergoing their epidemiologic transitions.

In criticizing Omran’s formulation,
Frenk et al. (1989) argue that between
the countries in the advanced stage of
the epidemiologic transition and those
in the initial stage lies a third group
that is undergoing a new transition experience quite different from that of
the developed nations. They describe
such countries as belonging to the
“protracted and polarized’ transition
model. This mode] is characterized by
the following features. (1) Overlap of
eras. The stages of the transition do not
follow a sequential order but exhibit
considerable overlap. (2) Countertransitions. The shift from high mortality
to high morbidity occurs not only for
degenerative diseases but also for infectious diseases as in some developing
countries. (3) Protracted transition.
The transition process is not clearly resolved as countries exhibit both infectious and chronic diseases. (4) Epidemiologic polarization. A polarization is

seen to occur between population
subgroups with the poor and rural populations succumbing to the pretransitional pathology while the urban populations experience posttransitional
pathology.

More recently, Omran (1993) modified the epidemiologic transition theory, taking account of the different
criticisms levelled against the theory.
Specifically, the idea of overlap of
diseases and the emergence of new
scourges like AIDS and the resurgence
of diseases like tuberculosis are now
included in the modification. Also,
Omran’s modification includes three
transitional variants—the rapid transitional variant, the intermediate transitional variant, and the slower transitional variant. To a large extent, this
modification has addressed most of the
issues raised by the different critics of
the older theory.

From these modifications to the epidemiologic transition theory, it would
not seem viable to apply a model based
on the epidemiological experiences of
one group of countries to another.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The method used here is relatively
straightforward. First, the regression
equations of Lopez and Hull (1983)
are used to obtain the cause-of-death
structure for certain African countries.
The countries selected for the validation exercise are those for which
reliable cause-of-death information
is available. Second, the estimated
cause-of-death structure is then compared with the observed one. The difference between the two is then explained using contemporary theories of

Cause of Death

249

mortality and making use of reasoning
based on internal consistency.

The basic equation for the indirect
estimation of the cause-of-death structure is given as:

M,;=a;+6;-M (1)

Where M; is the age-standardized
cause-specific death rate
for cause i (to be estimated)

M is the age-standardized
death rate for all causes
(given as input)

a; and b, are the fitted regression coefficients (obtained
from Lopez and Hull,
1983).

The regression coefficients a; and b;
fitted by Lopez-and Hull (1983) are
based on data compiled by Preston et
al. (1972). The data covered 165 national populations (mostly European
or “overseas European’), spanning
about one hundred years (1861 to
1964) and grouped into twelve broad
categories of causes of death. In order
to compute the standardized death
rates, Lopez and Hull used a “young
standard” population. This population
was unlike the “old standard” age
structure used by Preston and Nelson
(1974) which was inappropriate for use
in many African countries.

The cause-of-death groupings used
in some of the estimation are given in
Table 1. In comparing the estimated
cause-of-death structure with the observed one, we attempt to make the
cause-of-death categories as compatible as possible. The computations
were done using the author’s program
CAUSE.FOR written in standard
FORTRAN. The program uses as input data the crude death rate of a given

further regroups the cause-of-death

RESULTS

In the first application, we use data
on registered causes of death in urban
areas of Ghana in 1966. The urban
population comprised 15 per cent of
the total population, and the study period was from July to September. Table 2 shows a comparison between the

observed (urban) and the estimated
(national) cause-of-death structure using a cause-of-death grouping that allows for comparability. It would have
been better to compare estimates for
the urban area with the observed rates
for the same area. However, the estimates needed for mortality in the urban area were not available. Taking
into account that there is marked sea= sonality in mortality in Africa and that
‘ mortality patterns in rural areas are
5 quite different from those in urban
5 areas, the reported data can hardly
2 be said to be representative of the
national population. Nevertheless,
they allow rough comparisons. Table 2
shows a good agreement between the
model’s estimate for infectious diseases and the observed rates. For neo& plasms, respiratory diseases, and cardiovascular diseases, the model tends
to overestimate.
As a second illustration, the observed cause-of-death structure in rural Kenya is compared with the estimated cause-of-death structure (Table
). The observed data were obtained
from the demographic surveillance system of the Machakos project in rural
Kenya. The estimated cause-of-death
data were obtained using 1983 data.

© between the observed data and the estimated results than in the Ghanaian
case. Diseases of the respiratory system which appeared to be overestimated in Ghana now show very good
agreement with the data. However,
cardiovascular diseases appear to be
overestimated just as in the Ghanaian
case.

The results given above have shown
an overestimation of cardiovascular
diseases in Ghana and Kenya and an
underestimation in Mauritius. This difference is not a problem of methodology or data quality, but rather relates
to the differences in the epidemiological transition experienced in these
three countries relative to the countries

countries themselves are undergoing
different epidemiologic transitions.

In the cases of Ghana and Kenya,
both represent the delayed model, and
both are still in the early stages of
their transition, most likely the second
stage. At this stage, the incidence of
infectious diseases is much higher than
that of noninfectious diseases.

Mauritius, however, represents the
transitional variant of the delayed
model. Other countries belonging to
this model include Taiwan, South
Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Sri

Lanka, and Jamaica. These countries
experienced rapid mortality decline in
the 1940’s. A few decades later fertility
started to decline as well in response to
efficient, organized family-planning efforts supplemented by social development. Furthermore, the mortality decline in these countries, especially with
respect to infant and child mortality,
did not slacken but was sustained
(Omran, 1982).

Mauritius in the 1980’s saw a change
in its cause-of-death structure in which
noninfectious diseases began to pre

dominate over infectious diseases. This
period witnessed a rapid rise in cardiovascular diseases, even exceeding the
rates experienced by Western countries at similar levels of mortality.

The epidemiologic transition experienced in Western countries is fundamentally different from that experienced or being experienced in African
countries. This difference had been
described earlier by Omran (1971) in
classifying different experiences under
different models. One of the differences between these models lies in the
incidence of cancers and cardiovascular diseases. According to Hunt (1991,
p. 234):

Hypertension and coronary artery diseaseS were very rare in Africa in the
early part of this century. Both are
now emerging in certain population
groups and are likely to increase in
frequency and importance as causes of
morbidity and mortality.

Regarding the origin of these causes of
death, Hunt (1991, p. 236-237) writes:

With both diseases (cancers and heart
diseases), the patterns can be divided
between the conditions that have existed in Africa since before European
and Western influence arrived and those
that can be related directly or indirectly
to such influences.

Hence, for many African countries
where Western influence has been relatively less in terms of diet and life
styles, the cause-of-death structure is
characterized by a variation of different types of infectious diseases rather
than a variation of different causes of
death. As a result, an overall blanket
estimate of “‘infectious diseases’’ will
not be of much benefit.

With the exception of Kenya, the
model overestimated deaths due to

Cause of Death

253

respiratory diseases. This cause of
death has been much reduced due to
improvement in medicine and housing
conditions and no longer poses the
threat it did during the course of
the Western epidemiologic transition.
Hence, generally, the applicability of
the model is questionable for those
causes of death which have been
brought under control through internationally assisted intervention programs
in Africa.

In addition to the above, the regression model will not be applicable in
countries where “counter-transitions”
are being experienced because the uniform decline embodied in the regression model cannot capture rises which
follow declines.

If this regression methodology is
still to be employed in indirect estimation, then the epidemiological experiences of specific countries will have
to be considered. For example, in the
case of Latin America, the coefficients
obtained by Palloni and Wyrick (1981)
may be of some use. However, the
marked heterogeneity among the Latin
American countries will have to be
taken into account. The coefficients
obtained by Bah (1992) for Mauritius
may be useful if applied to other countries belonging to the same epidemiological transition model.

Alternatively, what we need is the
reverse of the direction taken in the
indirect estimation of cause-of-death
structure. Instead of using broad categories, we should now concentrate on
estimating rates for specific causes, using all available information. Grouping
together the rates for these causes, we
can obtain the rates for the residual
causes via the general mortality rate
(the rate of all causes combined).

For example, a reliable indirect estimation technique for estimating maternal mortality rates is that of Blum
and Fargues (1990) which can be used
to obtain fairly accurate rates for
maternal mortality. Cancer registries
(now emerging in some African countries like Zimbabwe) can be used to
obtain fairly accurate estimates of
cancer incidence and mortality. These
procedures can be followed by obtaining estimates of deaths from notifiable
diseases (readily available from ministries of health) and from deaths due
to traffic accidents (available from police records), etc. From these fairly reliable estimates, the known general
mortality can be used to obtain residual mortality from ‘‘all other causes.”
While this residual category could be
very broad, the technique used would
have provided upper limits for the
various causes included in the residual
category.

CONCLUSIONS

Life expectancy at birth in most African countries (with the exception of
some island populations like Mauritius
where mortality has approached that of
developed countries) ranges from 30 to
55 years. The major causes of death for
these countries can be grouped broadly
as follows: intestinal diseases, other
infectious diseases, airborne diseases,
maternal causes of death, accidents
and poisonings, behavioral diseases,
and complex and unexplained causes.

While these broad groups of causes
of death are common to many African
countries, there are many disparities
among their cause-of-death structures.
These disparities arise because of differences in environment, culture, cli

mate, education, income levels, population distribution, the availability and
accessibility of health services, the intensity of public health campaigns, and
a host of other factors. All these factors
contribute to the development of different epidemiologal profiles and to
different routes used in the process
of undergoing epidemiological transitions. This differentiation means that
in the estimation of cause-of-death
structure, broad regionalization will
not be useful. As much as possible, the
unit of analysis should be national or
if possible, subnational. Effort should
be directed to including some of the
sources of variation in cause-of-death
structures observed in Africa.

With the marked differences in the
epidemiologic transition experienced
in Western countries and those being
experienced in African countries, it
is not likely that an estimation of
cause-of-death structure based on data
from the former can accurately estimate cause-of-death structure in the
latter. This paper has used limited evidence to support this argument. We
propose that a better approach is to focus On specific causes for which tested
methods are available that can yield reliable estimates. These estimates can
then be used to obtain rates for residual causes if the general mortality rate
is known. The death rate for residual
causes can provide the upper limit for
the specific causes contained in the residual category.
