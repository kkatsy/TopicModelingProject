Effects of Social Status and Status
Inconsistency on Morbidity for the
Poor and Nonpoor: A Binary Variable

Multiple Regression Analysis

In previous epidemiological studies of
morbidity, attention has been relatively
concentrated on measuring the main independent effects of biosocial variables (biosocial attributes of the susceptibles) on the
vulnerability of individuals to disabling
conditions prevalent in a cross-sectional
population. Although social and demographic variables were included in the
analysis, they mainly served as controls.
Therefore, the relative impact from these
variables was not easily clarified. It is
expected, and often found, that the relationship between social factors and illness was
obscured since the ordinary cross-classification analysis limited its power in discriminating the synergistic from the interaction effects of independent variables on
the dependent variable. Moreover, difficulties may arise because (a) qualitative
data may not satisfy statistical requirements
necessary for the valid application of a
specific method, e.g., regression analysis;
and (b) demographic techniques in standardization limit the number of factors that
can be analyzed simultaneously.

For analyzing the effects of social vari
ables relative to stratification on the health
variable, a binary multiple regression technique is employed. It provides an excellent
alternative for further analyzing and overcoming problems encountered in low level
statistical measurement and is a reasonably
valid method to tease out main effects from
interactions that result from the combination of status factors.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The data source for this research is the
National Survey of Economic Opportunity
(1970) conducted by the Bureau of the
Census for the Office of Economic Opportunity in 1967. Since the focus of this study
is on work-limiting chronic conditions, the
sample was restricted to adult male heads
of families and other unrelated males between the ages of 25 through 64. Moreover,
in order to attain some degree_of homogeneity in the sample, only whites who
were in the labor force in 1966 were included. In this analysis, the total sample
consisted of 10,621 white adult males.

Two status dimensions, education and
occupation, were employed in this study.

Each status dimension is trichotomized
into high, medium, and low rank. Those
who have completed the years of schooling
for less than 9, 9 to 11, and 12 or more are
ranked as having low, medium, and high
educational status, respectively. Occupation,
defined as the longest civilian job of an
individual in 1966, is categorized into
white-collar occupations (high), blue-collar
occupations (medium), and others (including service workers and farm workers).
Thus, nine possible combinations of the two
status dimensions are categorized into three
broad groups. When two status dimensions
are either in the high, medium, or low
categories, there is obviously a consistent
status. When one status is high and the
other is low, there is a sharply inconsistent
status, The four residues of status combinations are considered as the moderately
inconsistent status (where there is onehigh-and-other-medium or one-mediumand-other-low status).

In the 1967 SEO, poverty status was
determined for each family (or unrelated
individual) by relating the 1966 income of
its members to a standard set of poverty
level income thresholds, used in federal
statistical reports to identify the poor.
These thresholds were developed by the
Social Security Administration (SSA) in
1964 and were further revised by a Federal
Interagency Committee in 1969 (Orshansky, 1969). The poverty income cutoffs
were adjusted by family size, the sex of
the family head, number of children under
18 years old, and farm-nonfarm residence.
The adjustments made for the SSA poverty
thresholds also take into account differences
in the cost of living between farm and nonfarm families. These thresholds are revised
in terms of annual changes in the consumer
price index. For example, in 1966, the
poverty thresholds ranged from $1,319 for
a female unrelated individual 65 years old
and over living on a farm to $5,903 for a

nonfarm family with a male head and seven
or more persons (from the forthcoming
report by Gladys K. Bowles, A. L. Bacon,
and P. N. Ritchey, “Rural-urban Migrants,
1967: A Comparison of the Demographic,
Social, and Economic Characteristics of
Rural-urban Migrants with Other Population Groups,” to be published by the University of Georgia and Office of Economic
Opportunity).

Those who lived under or at the poverty
threshold were considered to be in poverty;
whereas those who lived above the threshold were classified as not being in poverty.
It is expected, and often found, that
poverty in itself may have a significant
bearing on health. Therefore, the morbidity
factor is independently analyzed for two
subsamples, the poor and nonpoor. The
existence of chronic conditions caused by
a particular disease, injury, or impairment
which limited an individual’s ability to
work for more than three months is called
a work-limiting chronic condition or simply,
“morbidity” (Wan, 1971).

In this study, the additive effect of education and occupation variables on morbidity is examined using a binary variable
multiple regression technique in which all
the variables are binary (Boyle, 1970; Elwood, MacKenzie, and Cran, 1971; Feldstein and Butler, 1965; Shah and Abbey,
1971). Each variable represents a single
subclass of a factor and is assigned a value
of one if it is in the subclass, and zero
otherwise. Each factor (e.g., education) is
transformed into a number of regressor
variables (e.g., high and medium educational status) equivalent to the number of
the subclass minus one (Feldstein, 1966).
The use of binary variables does not involve
making any assumptions about the forms of
relationship and distribution (Suits, 1957;
Cox, 1970).

A regression equation is formulated as
follows, assuming no interaction:

M=a-+ BE, + Bok, +

where

M = 1 if one has morbidity, 0 if one does

not have morbidity;
a = intercept;

B; = regression coefficient for the 7-th
dummy variable;

E, = 1 if one has a high educational status,
O if one does not have a high educational status;

E,= 1 if one has a medium educational
status, 0 if one does not have a medium educational status;

O, = 1 if one has a high occupational status,
O if one does not have a high occupational status;

O, = 1 if one has a medium occupational
status, 0 if one does not have a medium occupational status;

a= an unobserved stochastic error with
E(u) = 0.

The above equation is further employed
in the analysis of two subsamples, the poor
and nonpoor. The proposed model estimates
the main effects of status factors (4 dummy
variables) on morbidity, and also provides
regression coefficients which can be used to
obtain predicted proportions of morbidity.
Empirically, it is possible to extend the
model by including more relevant factors
in the equation, and it may likely increase
the validity of prediction. In a review of
studies relative to status inconsistency, it

Social Biology

was found that “status inconsistents” employed as an interaction term in the analysis
may yield a positive increment in the dependent variable (Jackson and Burke,
1965). Thus, the present study will include
“status inconsistents” as interaction terms
in addition to the simple additive model. It
is hypothesized that “status inconsistents”
do exert a significant influence on morbidity, irrespective of poverty status. Moreover, it is expected that the additive model
including interaction terms may fit the data
better than the ordinary additive model in
the estimation of morbidity.

RESULTS

The regression equations for the simple
additive model including four dummy variables are shown in Table 1. The regression
coefficients Indicate the direction of relationships between status variables and
morbidity. In the first equation, an individual with low educational and occupational ranks has zero on all dummy
variables, and the predicted probability of
morbidity is 29.7, which is just the intercept of the equation. If one has high educational and occupational ranks, his predicted
morbidity condition is reduced by more
than 3 times, to 8.0 (ie, I= 0.297 —
0.133 — 0.085).

dicted proportions of morbidity and their
deviations for each category of status combinations. From equations (assuming no
interaction) in Table 1, we obtained predicted proportions (P). Then, the numbers
of predicted morbidity in each cell can be
calculated from the multiplication of P’s
to totals. There is no significant difference
between the observed numbers of morbidity
classified by two status dimensions compared with the numbers predicted by the
simple additive model (chi-square values =
3.05 and 2.90 for the total and not-inpoverty, respectively, with four degrees of
freedom). However, this is not true for persons living in poverty since the second
equation is not as accurate as the other two
equations in predicting morbidity (y? =
23.57; significant at 0.001 level).

Careful inspection of Table 2 reveals that
both the educational and occupation variables exert independent effects on morbidity. However, it seems that education has
more impact on morbidity than occupation.
Of all status combinations, with the exception of the case of low in both education
and occupation, those who had low-educa
tion and high-occupation status had the
highest observed proportion of morbidity
(26.9, 50.0, and 23.8 for the total, inpoverty, and not-in-poverty, respectively).
Subtracting the observed from the predicted
proportions of morbidity delineates the
term of interaction. If the deviation is in
the direction of observed-greater-than-predicted morbidity, we can ascertain the existence of interaction. This leads us to formulate a new prediction equation including
additive effects of education and occupation
and interaction terms, i.e., “status inconsistents” (Table 3).

The regression coefficients associated with
the interaction terms, which the morbidity
hypothesis would predict to be positive, are
in fact contributing a small increment on
the estimates of morbidity; yet, because
of a greater standard error than a regression
coefficient, we have to drop off a few interaction terms in the formation of new equations. Three equations including interaction
terms are given in Table 3.

Equation 4 has four dummy variables for
the additive effects and 3 dummy variables
for 3 forms of status inconsistency (conDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:33 08 December 2015

sistent, moderately inconsistent, and sharply
inconsistent). The coefficients of the four
status terms retain the same negative sign,
although all of them are reduced slightly in
size. For the three interaction terms, the
sharply inconsistent has a slightly higher
coefficient, independent of the additive
effects of education and occupation. The
estimated equations for the poor and nonpoor are slightly different since insignificant
terms have been dropped off from the
original equation (é-test was performed to
determine the significance of effect).
From Equations 4, 5, and 6 we obtained
new predicted proportions (P’) of morbidity
(Table 2). The chi-square test is again used
to detect significant differences in the
numbers between observed and new predicted morbidity. It is found that none of
these three equations will predict the numbers of morbidity significantly different
from the observed numbers. The chi-square
values are 0.147, 1.763, and 0.531 for the
total, in-poverty, and not-in-poverty, respectively. It is also worth noting that

moderately inconsistent, as well as sharply
inconsistent status, does have a significant
effect on morbidity for the total and the
nonpoor. Deviations of the predicted from
the observed morbidity are smaller for the
new additive-interaction model than for
the simple additive model.

Table 4 summarizes proportions of morbidity by comparing observed and predicted averages for three status inconsistent
groups of the total, the poor, and the
nonpoor. Morbidity increased as the level
of status inconsistency increased for the
nonpoor, but no such apparent positive relationship existed for the poor or the total.
The deviations of the predicted from the
observed proportions for 3 status inconsistent groups are presented on the right-hand
side of Table 4. Deviations obtained from
the additive-interaction model are smaller
than those of the simple additive model.
These lead us to confirm our hypothesis that
the additive-interaction model fits the data
better than the simple additive model in
estimation of morbidity. Moreover, the

CONCLUSIONS

The relationship between two status
dimensions (education and occupation) and
work-limiting morbidity is examined, using
data obtained from 1967 Survey of Economic Opportunity and analyzed by a
binary multiple regression method. An additive regression model does not adequately
explain the susceptibility of an individual
to morbidity by a single status dimension.
Hence, an alternative model using different
combinations of status ranks for education
and occupation was formulated to examine
the existence of interaction effects.

The results presented above clearly show
that interactions are not negligible in
morbidity study. The additive-interaction
model fits the data better than the simple
additive model in estimation of morbidity.
It is important to note that the binary
variable multiple regression analysis may
not only specify the main effects but also
detect interactions of social variables in

relation to morbidity. However, a valid
application of this technique should rely on
strong theoretical support in the explanation of interactions.

This research substantiates Jackson and
Burke’s findings (1965) in a stress-symptom study that status inconsistent terms
may have an adverse effect on health. The
findings pertaining to status inconsistency
and morbidity can be interpreted as an
indication of the association between social
stress and morbidity. It is plausible to draw
an inference concerning the underlying
etiological chains between social stress and
diseases. Furthermore, the findings of the
effects of education-occupation inconsistency on morbidity confirm Kas! and Cobb’s
conclusion that the payoff in morbidity
research (utilizing the concept of status
inconsistency) is most likely to come from
emphasis on education-occupation incongruence on men (Kasl and Cobb, 1971).
