Sex Differentials in Morbidity and Mortality

in the United States

ABSTRACT: Life expectation of females in the United States exceeds that of males, but females’
health while living appears worse. Based on self-reports of illness, females have higher incidence
rates for acute conditions, and a higher percentage of them have a chronic condition. The paper
examines sex differentials in mortality and morbidity for 1958-72, using national vital statistics
and Health Interview Survey data. The reversal of mortality and morbidity sex differentials in the
aggregate is due in part to a distribution effect, diseases with a male excess being weighted heavily
in mortality, but those with a female excess dominating morbidity. For specific conditions, sex
morbidity and sex mortality differentials are usually in the same direction, the sicker sex being
more likely to die. For several conditions, however, females have higher morbidity but lower
mortality than males. By incorporating diagnostic data, these reversals are attributed to females’
interviewing and illness behavior, rather than to higher physical morbidity.

The life expectation of females in the
United States exceeds that of males, at age
zero and all other ages. But the health of
females while living appears worse. From
illness survey data, females have higher
incidence rates for acute conditions, and a
higher percentage of them have one or
more chronic conditions. Moreover, when
ill, females are more disabled. They spend
more days of restricted activity and more
days in bed than males for an illness.
These facts are counterintuitive. Most
deaths are preceded by an episode of illness. It is reasonable that the sicker sex
should have higher death rates. How is it,
then, that females can be both more ill and
more longevous than men? I propose to
explain this reversal of sex differentials.

This paper first considers sex differentials in morbidity and mortality rates for
1958-72, demonstrating the persistence of
the sex reversal. Trends in sex differentials

are also examined to ascertain if they are
widening or narrowing in the United
States. Next, rates are disaggregated by
illness condition and by cause of death.
Examining the sex differentials attached
to component diseases and the relative
weighting of diseases to make up aggregate rates, the causes of the aggregate reversal are identified. Finally, sex reversals
attached to specific diseases are analyzed
in detail. These reversals apparently arise
from sex differences in interview and illness behavior, not from situations in
which the clinically sicker sex has lower
death rates.

DATA SOURCES

Mortality data are from National
Center for Health Statistics publications
(Vital Statistics of the United States, Volume 2, Part A, and Monthly Vital Statistics Reports) and from unpublished materials for 1970-72. Morbidity data are
principally from publications for the na

tional Health Interview Survey, conducted since 1957 by the National Center
for Health Statistics (Vital and Health
Statistics, Series B and 10).! The survey
covers the civilian noninstitutional population of the United States. Mortality data
cover all United States residents. The difference in coverage is slight, the survey
population being 99 per cent of the resident population in 1970.

SEX DIFFERENTIALS IN MORTALITY

In the United States, the excess of male
death rates over female rates has been increasing for several decades (Metropolitan
Life, 1974). Enterline (1961) has considered trends in sex mortality differentials
for 1929-58. In that period, the age groups
15—24 and 45-64 showed especially large
increases in the mortality gap between the
sexes, and Enterline identifies causes of
death which accounted for the trend.

Recently, Klebba and coworkers have
traced trends in age-specific mortality
rates and cause-specific rates for 1950—
69 (Klebba, 1971; Klebba et al., 1973,
1974). They find no appreciable change in
sex differentials for crude death rates. But
age-specific and cause-specific data show
changes masked by aggregation and by
faster aging of the female population in
this period. For both whites and nonwhites, male excess mortality has been increasing at most ages, except the very oldest and youngest (Klebba, 1971, p. 27;
Klebba et al., 1973, p. 30). Trends in sex
mortality ratios for leading causes are reported (Klebba et al., 1974) and also show

1T use the period 1958-72 rather than 1957-72.
The Seventh Revision of the International Standard
Classification of Diseases (World Health Organization, 1957) (hereafter ICDA) was first used to code
cause-of-death in the United States in 1958. In 1968,
the Eighth Revision (National Center for Health
Statistics, 1967) came into use. The 1967 mortality
data and July 1957-June 1958 morbidity data use the
Sixth Revision. It does not differ radically from the
Seventh Revision, but creating a time series of rates
and sex ratios for detailed conditions is simplified by
eliminating that year.

persistent changes in sex differentials,
which I will discuss. Trends in the size of
sex mortality ratios have provoked recent
attention not only for the United States
population, but also for Western populations generally (Preston, 1970; Retherford,
1970).

Let us consider recent sex mortality differentials in the United States. What
causes of death persistently show higher
rates for males than females in 1958-72? Is
male excess mortality for these causes increasing over this period?

Table 1 shows age-adjusted sex differentials for leading causes of death for
1958-72. Age-adjusted rates remove the
influence of the female population’s older
age distribution and faster aging in this
period.” Sex differentials are presented in
two ways: the ratio of rates for females
and males, and the difference of those
rates. The ratio is [Female Rate/Male
Rate]. The difference is [Female Rate —
Male Rate]. (Placing the female rate first
in these differentials is unconventional in
mortality analysis, but conventional in
morbidity analysis.) Table 2 summarizes
the direction and trends in sex differentials
over the period. Together, the tables show
a strong female advantage (i.e., male excess) in mortality, which is increasing.

For all causes of death combined, female rates are only 56-64 per cent of male
rates. Over the period 1958-72, the difference in rates has favored females strongly.
Per 100,000 population, 343 to 402 more
males than females died each year. The
sex ratio has decreased and the sex differ
2 For every year 1958-72, females are “older,”
having a higher proportion aged 65+ (Grove and
Hetzel, 1968; U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1974a).
This age difference contaminates comparisons of
crude period rates. Also, the female population is
aging faster than the male population. The proportion of persons 65+ increased 1.8 per cent for females
over 1958-72 but only 0.1 per cent for males. This
fact complicates analysis of trends in sex differentials, if crude rates are used. Age standardization
eliminates both of these problems.

SOURCES: For cause-specific age-adjusted rates, Klebba et al., 1974. For All causes age-adjusted rate, Klebbaet al., 1973. For 1958-67, Seventh
Revision of ICDA is used. For 1968-72, Eighth Revision is used. Standard population chosen for direct method of age adjustment is 1940 total
enumerated population. The full table with all years 1958-72 is available from the author.

* The causes shown are the leading ones for 1969 They appear in rank order. In 1972, the same fifteen conditions were leading, with these
changes in rank order: diabetes mellitus (6), certain causes of mortality in early infancy (7), cirrhosis of liver (8), arteriosclerosis (9), bronchitis/
emphysema/asthma (10), homicide (12), congenital anomalies (13). Eighth Revision ICDA codes are in parentheses after each specific cause.

t Under each title, three age-adjusted items are shown: death rate for total population, sex mortality ratio, and sex mortality difference, in that
order. Ratio is [Female Rate/Male Rate}. Difference is [Female Rate~Male Rate].

$ The rate is deaths per 100,000 live births. Rates are computed from Klebba et al., 1974, Table 4, for 1958-69. For 1970-72, numerators are
from National Center for Health Statistics, 1974a,c,f. Birth denominators are from National Center for Health Statistics, 19746,d,e.

§ The rate is deaths under age 1 per 100,000 live births. Rates are computed from Klebba et al., 1974, Table 5, for 1958-69. (In 1972, congenital
anomaly deaths under age 1 account for 64% of all deaths from that cause. See Klebba et al., pp. 46-47, for rationale of using former.) For

1970-72, numerators and denominators are from same sources as in footnote (¢}. For those years,

differences cannot be computed for those years.

ence has increased, both reflecting relative
improvement for females between 1958
and 1972.

Most of the fifteen leading causes of
death show a similar pattern in sex differentials. Fourteen of them have a male excess (thus, a sex ratio below 1.00 and a
positive sex difference). The exception is
diabetes mellitus. Over time, the female
advantage increases for five titles (Causes
No. 1, 2, 3, 5, and 13) in both the sex ratio
and sex difference. In addition, females’
disadvantage for diabetes mellitus (7) is
decreasing. For four titles (4, 9, 10, and
12), a female advantage is maintained,
showing no trend in one or both measures.
Three titles (6, 8, and 14) have “compet
ing” trends. Although the sex ratios show
relative improvement (or maintained advantage) for females, the sex differences
are narrowing, indicating relative improvement for males. The reason is simple: Death rates for these diseases have
declined sharply for both sexes from 1958
to 1972. In this situation, the difference in
rates can narrow while the sex ratio remains constant or even widens. I prefer
the sex ratio as a measure of relative mortality risks and therefore interpret the
trends for these three causes as favorable
to females.

Females’ advantage is eroding for only
two leading causes (suicide and peptic
ulcer). Death rates from suicide are in

creasing (especially in 1969-72), and female rates are rising faster than male
rates. Peptic ulcer death rates are decreasing overall, but more rapidly for males
than females.

In summary, males have higher death
rates than females for most leading causes,
and their excess mortality is increasing in
the period 1958-72. Where do females suffer a disadvantage in the leading cause of
death? Only in their higher rates for diabetes mellitus (which are, however, edging
closer to male rates) and their “catching
up” in suicide and peptic ulcer rates.
These three causes account for only 4.1
per cent of the 1972 deaths from leading
causes and 3.6 per cent of all 1972 deaths.
(Altogether, the fifteen leading causes account for 88 per cent of all 1972 deaths.)

Age-adjusted rates were also examined
for five other causes of death for the period

1968-72.3 The titles are syphilis and its
sequelae (ICDA 090-094); avitaminoses
and other nutritional deficiencies (260269); acute bronchitis and_ bronchiolitis (466); appendicitis (540-543); and
cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, and cholangitis (574, 575). These are not “leading”
causes, accounting for only 0.5 per cent of
all 1972 deaths, but they are of contemporary concern to epidemiologists and health
planners. Male death rates are higher than
female ratés for all of these conditions. For
four titles, the male advantage worsens
slightly or persists over the period. For
only one title (syphilis) are female rates
coming closer to male rates.

In addition, age-adjusted rates were
computed for fourteen more titles for

3 The age-adjusted rates are from unpublished
data, National Center for Health Statistics. A table
concerning sex differentials for these titles is in Verbrugge, 1975, p. 16. :

1958-71, to be compared with morbidity
titles later. These titles are all minor
causes of death. Table 3 shows that all but
one title (arthritis/rheumatism) have persistent male excess rates for the period
1958-71. Nine titles show trends favoring
females, compared to males. Only two
show any evidence of a worsening situation for females, compared to males.

In summary, Klebba (1971) finds that
male mortality rates rose for some important diseases in the 1960’s, after a period of
stationary rates. In addition, this analysis
demonstrates that males’ mortality situation worsened relative to females in that
period for most causes of death. (The 34
titles examined encompass over 95 per
cent of all 1972 deaths.) It is believed,
but not thoroughly demonstrated, that
changes in life-styles (smoking, alcohol
consumption, driving) have adversely affected males more than females, and that
these changes account for the deterioration
in their mortality rates.

SEX DIFFERENTIALS IN MORBIDITY

An abundant and continuous source of
illness data for the United States is the
Health Interview Survey. Respondents
report acute illnesses or injuries which required either medical attention or reduced
daily activity in the two weeks before interview and any chronic conditions which
restrict their activity or mobility. By confining reports to conditions which spur
medical attention or disability, the survey
data eliminate minor symptoms (those
above a private threshold of feeling sick,
but not severe enough to alter routine activities). Perception of such symptoms
may vary sharply across social groups.
Analyses of the data (Public Health Service, 1958-1962, and National Center for
Health Statistics, 1963-1974) tend to interpret the incidence and prevalence rates
as measures of physical illness. In that

Verbrugge

Social Biology

spirit, I discuss sex morbidity differentials
and their trends for 1958-72. Later, I shall
argue that a social interpretation of these
data is inescapable.

Like mortality data, the Health Interview Survey data encompass all disease
conditions (thus, the full range of codes in
National Center for Health Statistics, 1967,
and World Health Organization, 1957).
Also, they provide a yearly time series
which can be compared with annual mortality rates. In the following discussion,
morbidity rates are age-adjusted to the
same standard population as mortality
rates (see Sources, Table 1).

ACUTE CONDITIONS

Females experience more acute conditions per year than males do (Table 4).
The female excess for all acute conditions
varies from 9 per cent to 20 per cent between 1958 and 1972. Per 100 population,
females have 17 to 39 more conditions per
year than do males. For the five major
categories of acute conditions, female excess rates persist for infective and parasitic
diseases, respiratory conditions, and digestive system conditions.‘ Their rates are
7 to 30 per cent, 11 to 25 per cent, and 6 to
38 per cent greater than males, respectively. In terms of differences, the gap is
especially large for respiratory conditions.
Per 100 population, females have 12 to 27
more acute episodes than males do. Females also have excess morbidity for
“other acute conditions,” even when reproduction events are deleted (41 to 70 per
cent). Only for injuries do males have
persistently higher rates than females.

The sex differential for acute conditions
has remained quite stationary since 1958.
In Table 4, the ratios and differences fluctuate from year to year, but they show no
overall trend for “all acute conditions” and

* There are two minor exceptions. The sex ratio is
less than 1.00 for infective and parasitic diseases one
year; for digestive system conditions, another year.

denominators (population at risk), Grove and Hetzel, 1968, for 1958-59; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1974a, for 1960-69, 1971, and 19745 for
1970.For 1958-67, Seventh Revision of ICDA is used. For 1968-71, Eighth Revision is used. Standard population for direct method of age
adjustment is 1940 total enumerated population. The full table with all years 1958-71 is available from the author.

* In this table, causes are grouped so they match morbidity condition groups, discussed later. Eighth Revision ICDA codes used to compute
rates are in parentheses after each cause. This is the closest feasible match to the span of codes for the same morbidity condition (see Wilder, 1973,
p. 50 and Wilson 1973s, p. 49 for these codes). Seventh Revision ICDA codes used for the mortality rates are available from the author.

t “F” denotes improving position of females relative to males. “M” denotes improving position of males relative to females. “No trend (F)”
denotes a female advantage which is maintained over the period, but shows no trend. .

+ Under each title, three age-adjusted items are shown: death rate for female population, sex mortality ratio, and sex mortality difference, in
that order. Ratio is [Female Rate/Male Rate]. Difference is [Female Rate —Male Rate].

§ The span of codes used to compute rates differs for the Seventh and Eighth Revisions of ICDA. This computation artifact, plus any real
hate = diagnosis of these causes, produces marked differences in rates and sex differentials between 1958-67 (Seventh Revision) and 1968-71

ighth Revision). ,

' This title includes a leading cause of death (influenza/pneumonia in the respiratory group; cirrhosis of liver in the digestive group; and
accidents, suicide, homicide in injuries). The title is not counted in the text discussion of this table.

# Beginning in 1962, the number of deaths diagnosed as ICDA (511-517, $20, $22-§27.0, §27.2) drop sharply. Consequently, rates drop and
sex differentials change for 1962-67. '

** Mortality data are not disaggregated enough for 1958-67 to compute rates.

the fourth category.

the five categories. (One might claim a
slight improvement among males for
“other acute conditions” relative to females, but the evidence is slender.) In light
of males’ worsening mortality situation,
should we expect a declining female excess
in acute conditions? No, since the deterioration in male mortality is occuring mainly
for chronic conditions (Klebba, 1971).°

5 There is an interesting, though small, trend in
sex differentials for respiratory conditions. Female
rates show a slight improvement, compared to male
rates, (Both the sex ratio and sex difference decrease.) Recall that mortality data show a relative
improvement among females for bronchitis/emphysema/asthma. Most deaths occur from chronic forms
of these titles, but acute conditions are often precursors of chronic ones. There is suggestive agreement in
these trends.

CHRONIC CONDITIONS

.Per cent with chronic condition and
per cent limited by it.—Chronic conditions are more prevalent among females
than males, but they are more consequential for males. For 1957-67, Table 5 shows
that a higher per cent of females have a
chronic condition in each period measured. However, having a chronic ailment
tends to be more limiting for males. In all
years measured, a higher per cent of them
are completely unable to carry on the
major activity for their age group. Looking at age-specific prevalence, the difference is small for youths under age 17 and
widens for every successive age group. At

* For persons under age 17, the major activity is school. For women 17+, it is housework, job, or school. For men 17+, it is job or school. See

Wilder, (1974, pp. 51-52) for full definitions.

+ This category includes persons who have trouble getting around alone, who cannot get around alone (and need help to do so), and who are

confined to their houses.

$ In 1968, the Health Interview Survey began to emphasize only chronic conditions which limit activity or mobility. From that year on, there is
no split of “persons without a condition” and “those with a condition that poses no limitation.”

§ Calendar year(s).

ages 65+, the gap is remarkable, with 9 to
21 per cent more males than females
completely unable to do strenuous work of
any kind. In 1972, 28 per cent of all men
aged 65+ were disabled to that extent,
compared to only 8 per cent of women that
age.

The relationship between a chronic
condition and activity limitation are complex. Illness may restrict activity. But
some people change their roles to accommodate an illness, thereby reducing or
eliminating activity restriction. If females
are more able to alter roles than males, or
their roles are less strenuous, the, reported
differentials could appear, even, if the
sexes have identical prevalence of physical
illness. wh

How achronic condition limits mobility
is a better measure of physical severity.
Age-standardized prevalence shows that
males and females are similarly hampered

in their mobility by chronic conditions.
But the standardization masks different
patterns of the age-specific rates: Under
age 15, the sexes are equally limited. At
ages 15-44 and 45-64, more males are
limited, suggesting they have more severe
conditions. At ages 65+ , more females are
limited. However, the higher prevalence
at ages 65+ may simply reflect females’
older age distribution, rather than more
severe conditions at the same (elderly) age
as males. Overall, the pattern of agespecific rates suggests that females’
chronic conditions are less severe than
males’.

Over the period 1957-72, the situation
for females has been improving relative to
males. Both sexes show increasing per
cents with a chronic condition, but that
per cent is rising faster for males than
females. Thus, males’ advantage in this
regard is decreasing. The sex difference in

 

 

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

Vol. 23, No. 4

per cent unable to do their major activity
is widening, the per cent of limited males
rising quite sharply. Age-specific mobility
limitation data (not shown) reveal an increasing per cent of older males (45+) with
some mobility limitation, but a stable or
decreasing per cent of limited females.

Prevalence of specific chronic conditions. —Age-adjusted prevalence rates
were computed for selected diseases and
impairments which limit major activity.
When symptoms compel such restriction,
we can confidently assume that the respondent is indeed physically ill and, with
less confidence, that he/she has named the
disease correctly.

Of the 25 conditions with data for
1959-70, the majority (15) have a male
excess, which is shown in Table 6 by a sex
ratio below 1.00. These are principal
chronic conditions. Fifty-six per cent of all
people limited by chronic conditions in
1969-70 reported one of them. Including
three conditions with data for 1969-70
only and which show a male excess (cerebrovascular diseases, emphysema, hay
fever), the figure is 62 per cent. Excess
rates are largest for peptic ulcer, hernia,
and other respiratory conditions (which
include chronic influenza, pneumonia,
pulmonary congestion), the prevalence
rates often being more than twice those of
females.

Eight of the remaining conditions have
a female excess. Among people limited by
chronic conditions in 1969-70, 32 per cent
reported one of them. Including one condition with data for 1969-70 only (diseases
of kidney and ureter), the figure is 33 per
cent. The female disadvantage is most
pronounced for benign/unspecified neoplasms, hypertension, varicose veins, and
genitourinary conditions.

Two conditions show no persistent sex
difference: malignant neoplasms and “other circulatory system conditions.”

In summary, when we consider chronic

Morbidity and Mortality

285

ailments that force a person to restrict activity, a pronounced male excess appears
for the majority of conditions. Among
them are several leading causes of death.
Females have excess morbidity for one
important killer (diabetes mellitus) and for
less fatal conditions such as mental/nervous conditions, varicose veins, arthiritis/
rheumatism, and genitourinary conditions—causes of much greater morbidity
than mortality.

Between 1959-70, there are few discernible trends in sex differentials for
chronic conditions. In both the sex ratio
and sex difference, females appear to be
“catching up” to males in prevalence of
hernias. (Hernia rates have decreased, but
less rapidly for females than for males.) An
opposite trend: Males’ rates of visual impairments are worsening relative to females’. (Their prevalence rates have
increased; females’ have decreased.) The
overall male excess in morbidity is maintained. This stability is surprising; it does
not agree with mortality trends for chronic
diseases (Klebba, 1971). The poor match
of these trends has no obvious explanation.

Summary of Sex Morbidity Differentials.—Excess female morbidity is
found for most acute conditions and for
prevalence of chronic conditions generally. But excess male morbidity appears for
six chronic conditions which cause high
mortality: diseases of heart, cerebrovascular diseases, “other respiratory system
conditions” (which include influenza and
pneumonia), _ bronchitis/emphysema/asthma, peptic ulcer, and impairments (which
include congenital anomalies).° It appears
also for an acute condition (injuries) associated with high mortality (deaths from
accidents, suicide, and homicide). Moreover, males seem to have more severe
chronic conditions.

® For cerebrovascular diseases, data for only one
period are available.

In the period 1958-72, females’ excess
for acute conditions shows no sign of diminishing, but males’ excess for chronic
conditions is generally worsening. Males
are increasingly likely to have a chronic
condition and their limitation is increasing, relative to females. Male excess morbidity from chronic conditions which are
principal killers is stable, showing no signs
of increase.

COMPARING MORBIDITY
AND MORTALITY

Aggregated mortality data show higher
death rates for males. Disaggregation
shows their higher rates from most causes
of death. Aggregate incidence and prevalence data for morbidity show that females
are “sicker,” but disaggregation reveals
some prominent conditions with higher
male rates than female rates. (It is important to note that disaggregated data for
chronic conditions refer to limiting conditions. Aggregated limiting chronic conditions do show a male excess.) This urges a
comparison of cause-specific rates of
morbidity and mortality. For specific
conditions, does the sex with higher illness
rates also have higher death rates? Or are
there reversals, the sicker sex somehow
having a mortality advantage?

The answer to this should inform us
about the reversal of sex differentials in
the aggregate (higher female morbidity,
higher male mortality). The sex differential for “all causes,” or “all conditions,” is
a function of cause-specific sex differentials and of weights reflecting the relative
frequency of cause-specific deaths, or
illnesses, within each sex. The aggregate
reversal may be due to (a) different weighting of illness conditions and causes of
death to produce the aggregate rates or (6)
reversals in cause-specific rates (one sex
sicker, but the other more likely to die), or
(c) both.

Social Biology

Although both mortality and morbidity
data use the International Standard
Classification of Diseases (ICDA) codes,
their aggregation differs in published reports. Moreover, many mortality titles do
not differentiate acute and chronic forms
of a disease; they are combined in a single
title. These two features hamper comparison of morbidity and mortality data. The
closest possible match of morbidity and
mortality titles was made, and sex differentials for age-standardized rates were
compared. Because morbidity tabulations
have less detail than mortality data, it was
often necessary to aggregate cause-ofdeath titles and to compute agestandardized rates for that aggregation (an
unusual one, from the perspective of mortality tabulations). While this procedure
minimizes the first problem above, the
second problem has no solution, and many
cause-of-death titles are counted twice in
the table. Because of that difficulty, the
effect of the two factors noted above
(weights and component sex differentials)
on the aggregate sex differentials cannot
be separated quantitatively.

Table 7 compares sex differentials for
matched morbidity and mortality titles.
The 27 titles in Table 7 are the standard
titles for acute and chronic morbidity
tabulations (see titles in Table 6 and Wilson, 1973a, p. 49). (They are necessarily
used because of their greater aggregation
than mortality titles.)

For 22 titles, the match of ICDA codes
for morbidity and mortality rates is perfect
or near-perfect. For 5 titles, the match is
quite close, but the span of mortality codes
exceeds the morbidity codes, or vice versa.

Consider first the perfect-match and
near-match titles which show that the
same sex is disadvantaged for both morbidity and mortality. These twelve titles
accounted for 54 per cent of all deaths in
1970. Including the imperfect-match titles
which show no sex reversal, the titles ac

count for 67 per cent of all 1970 deaths.
Altogether, these fifteen titles include ten
leading causes of death: diseases of heart,
cerebrovascular disease, (chronic) influenza and pneumonia, diabetes mellitus,
(chronic) bronchitis/emphysema/asthma,
and peptic ulcer. Accidents, suicide, and
homicide are causes of death attached to
injuries; congenital anomalies, to impairments. Most of the fifteen titles are chronic
conditions.

Sex reversals appear for seven perfect/near-match titles. In all cases, females
have higher morbidity rates but lower
mortality rates. These titles accounted for
only 6 per cent of all deaths in 1970. (Digestive system codes are counted only once
in that figure.) Acute conditions are prominent in these titles. Two imperfectly
matched titles show a sex reversal: varicose veins and acute respiratory conditions. The former is a “true” reversal.
Since 1968, the number of deaths by sex
for each ICDA code is published. The
crude death rate for varicose vein conditions (ICDA 454, 456) is very small, but it
is greater for males than females. Whether

the reversal for acute respiratory conditions is true cannot be determined, since
the attached ICDA codes include many
conditions which are usually chronic and
rarely acute as causes of death.

Finally, there are two conditions which
sometimes have male excess morbidity,
sometimes female, but consistently have
male excess mortality. One condition has
female excess morbidity, but no persistent
sex differential for mortality. Strangely,
malignant and benign/unspecified neoplasms are two of these “mixed” cases.
Their differentials are consistent with the
hypothesis that females’ greater utilization
of health services (Aday and Eichhorn,
1972; Andersen et al., 1972) leads to
higher rates of neoplasm diagnosis among
them. Benign neoplasms are especially
likely to be found. Males may have higher
prevalence of malignant neoplasms, and
their higher death rates would reflect that
as well as late diagnosis (too late for control therapy). Benign neoplasms seldom
cause death, and the sexes show no difference in mortality rates for them.

The reasons for the aggregate reversal

Vol. 23, No. 4

of sex differentials are clear. It is due to
both “weights” attached to titles and the
presence of sex reversals for some titles.
First, leading causes of death do not tend
to be leading causes of illness. For 195872, the common cold, influenza, and other
respiratory conditions lead the list of acute
morbidity, with infective/parasitic diseases and various injuries next. Leading
the chronic morbidity list are heart conditions, arthritis/rheumatism, impairments,
and mental/nervous conditions. Few of
these morbidity titles are prominent causes
of death.

Moreover, acute illnesses are much
more common than chronic ones. In
1971~72, the United States population endured about 448 million acute conditions,
but only 26 million people had a limiting
chronic condition in 1972. Acute and
chronic rates cannot be pooled into one
list, since the former count conditions in
the numerator, while the latter count persons. Nevertheless, a scan of rates indicates roughly how a pooled list would rank
illness conditions, if a single counting convention were used. Chronic conditions
would appear far down the list, heart
conditions being about as numerous as
headaches (which restricted activity or required medical attention) in 1972. In
summary, radically different weights are
attached to diseases when they are illnesses than when they are causes of death.

Second, some titles do have sex reversals. In fact, these titles receive very different weights for morbidity and mortality. The combination of sex reversals and
of weights which reinforce them produces
the aggregate discrepancy.

Most leading causes of death show male
excess rates for both morbidity and mortality. The sicker sex does have higher
death rates, which is reasonable. (The sole
leading cause with female excess mortality, diabetes mellitus, also has female excess morbidity.)

Morbidity and Mortality

291

But the existence of sex reversals is
perplexing. Why do some specific deseases
show a reversal in the sex differential?
Why do females have higher morbidity
but lower mortality than males for nine
conditions?

In evaluating reasons for these reversals, the sources of morbidity and mortality data must be recalled. Cause-specific
death rates are based on death certificates.
While living, the decedents experienced
physical risks (acquired and/or intrinsic)
which led to death from one cause rather
than another. Sex mortality differentials
reflect systematic differences in those risks
for males and females. (Additionally,
Moriyama et al. [1966] have found a
modest per cent of inaccurate diagnosis of
cause-of-death. If sex biases exist in assigning cause of death, a sex mortality differential may arise from physician behavior, as well as decedent behavior.)

Illness rates are based on interviews.
Respondents have different physical vulnerability to diseases, due to acquired and
intrinsic health characteristics. To the extent the risks vary for social aggregates,
differentials in illness rates appear. But
two other factors enter illness data: interview behavior and illness behavior
(Mechanic, 1966).

The first factor refers to respondents’
cooperation during the interview, their
ability to recall illness episodes, their verbal skills in describing illness, and their
presence during the interview (vs. proxy
response about their illnesses). If interview
behavior differs for males and females, sex
differences arise in illness rates which do
not reflect different vulnerability to disease. There is no evidence that cooperation, recall, and verbal skills differ by sex.
But the self-reporting vs. proxy-reporting
does. Proxy respondents systematically
underreport morbidity of the absent person (Koons, 1973). Since the majority of
proxy interviews are for absent males
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

292

(Cannell et al., 1968, pp. 7-8, Laurent et
al., 1972, p. 12), a sex effect is introduced
into the data.

Second, numerous social and psychological factors have been postulated to account for higher reports of illness by females and their greater activity restriction
compared to males. Females may have
lower thresholds for perceiving discomfort, whether for social (Mechanic, 1972)
or biological reasons. Moreover, regardless of a threshold, females may be more
willing than males to report a perceived
discomfort (Barker, 1953; Chesler, 1972;
Ehrenreich and English, 1973; Mechanic,
1965; Phillips and Segal, 1969). In addition, females may be socialized (more so
than males) to take curative measures
when ill (Chesler, 1972). Females have
generally fewer time constraints than
males, which allows them to seek medical
attention and to restrict activity more
readily than males. When illness data are
limited to conditions which caused such
attention or restriction, an important sex
differential automatically enters the data
(Mechanic and Newton, 1965). The
Health Interview Survey rates for acute
conditions and activity restriction from
chronic ones are clear examples of this.

In summary, sex differentials in illness
may reflect sex differences in four factors:
interview behavior, illness behavior, acquired health risks, and intrinsic health
risks. Sex differentials in death reflect
primarily the last two. In general, the first
two (reporting) factors operate to produce
higher illness reports for females than
males. The last two (physical) factors tend
to generate higher illness rates for males
than females. Data on life style and exposure to environmental and occupational
hazards indicate that males lead “riskier”
lives which cause higher rates of injury,
illness, and death. Genetic factors which
disfavor males have also been postulated,
e.g., the protective action of estrogen

Verbrugge

Social Biology

against cholesterol synthesis. Higher male
fetal death rates and congenital anomaly
death rates are cited as evidence of inherent male weakness compared to females.

The relative impact of reporting and
physical factors on self-reported illness is
not known, nor have sex differences in
interview and illness behavior been
specified, especially with regard to Health
Interview Survey data. Nathanson (1975)
reviews several reasons for excess female
morbidity in aggregate data and suggests
that fewer role obligations and time constraints principally account for the excess.
No quantitative assessment of the factors
has been made.

Let us now consider the nine conditions
with sex reversals. When possible, an independent source with diagnostic rates is
used, to determine if females are physically sicker than males or if their interview
and illness behavior account for the excess
morbidity.

Dohrenwend and Dohrenwend (1969)
review evidence of mental/nervous disorders and conclude that females have more
neurotic symptoms than males.” These are
the most common mental disorders, but
they may not be the most limiting ones.
Psychotic disorders, which show no consistent sex difference, are probably the
chief cause of limitation from mental/ nervous conditions. Consider also data from
the national Health Examination Survey.
Adults filled out a questionnaire, in private, about 12 symptoms of psychological
distress. For all twelve, women produced
higher rates than men (Dupuy et al.,
1970). The sex differentials are smaller,
however, than for the Health Interview
Survey. (Are males more reluctant to report these symptoms to an interviewer?)

7 However, males have higher rates of personality
disorders than women. Both neurosis and personality
disorders are antisocial responses, and sex differences
may simply reflect different manifestations of stress
by males and females, or even physician preferences
in diagnosis.

Vol. 23, No. 4

Furthermore, research indicates a sex
bias among physicians, who tend to diagnose mental/nervous disorders in females
more than in males presenting the same
symptoms (Lenanne and Lenanne, 1973).
Assuming such diagnoses are reported in
the health interview, the physician bias is
perpetuated there. In summary, all evidence suggests that the reported excess
morbidity of females is due to social factors. Why males have higher mortality
rates attributed to these disorders remains
unexplained. It is unknown if physicians
have a sex bias in death diagnosis for
mental/nervous disorders.

There is some diagnostic evidence for
hypertension (without heart involvement).
The Health Examination Survey found
higher rates of definite hypertension
among males up to age 54, but a female
excess at older ages (Gordon and Devine,
1966, p. 13). Borderline hypertension
showed a male excess at most ages. In
contrast to these clinical data, the 1972
Health Interview Survey asked if respondents had the symptom “high blood
pressure.” Females show excess rates at all
ages (sex ratio varies from 1.14 to 1.71).
The Health Interview Survey data in
Table 6 refer to limiting conditions only;
there, the sex differential shows an even
larger female excess. (A table summarizing
the age-specific sex differentials from the
three sources is available from the author.)
The evidence clearly implies that females
are more likely than males to report hypertensive symptoms (because of earlier
knowledge of it, greater cooperation during the interview, or less proxy response)
and are especially likely to restrict activity
for it. The inflation of female reports occurs at all ages, even the oldest when females do have higher clinical rates of
hypertension.

No diagnostic rates for the total United
States population have been found for

Morbidity and Mortality

293

“other digestive system conditions.”*® In
1968, the Health Interview Survey asked
about symptoms of digestive conditions
(Wilson, 1973b). Seven disorders queried
are titles in “other digestive system conditions”: functional and symptomatic upper
gastrointestinal disorders, gallbladder conditions, chronic enteritis and ulcerative
colitis, gastritis and duodenitis, frequent
constipation, intestinal conditions, and
liver conditions (which include cirrhosis of
liver). For all but one of them, females
reported higher morbidity for adult ages.
The sex ratios are roughly of the same
magnitude found in Table 6. Do females
inflate reports of digestive symptoms, and
of limitation from them, despite a true
male excess in physical morbidity? The
data are insufficient for us to know.

No clinical data for the total population
have been located for varicose veins.
However, chronic circulatory conditions
were a special topic in the 1972 Health
Interview Survey. For varicose veins, the
age-standardized sex ratio is 3.88, larger
than the ratios for limiting conditions
(average 2.55). This symptom excess appears for all age groups. Apparently, females readily report varicose veins, but
afflicted females are less likely to be restricted by the ailment than afflicted
males. Do males have higher prevalence,
which is entirely masked by female reporting? Or, are male prevalence rates lower
but their conditions more severe, resulting
in higher mortality? The evidence is insufficient for us to choose one of these
explanations.

No clinical data for the total population
were located for diseases of kidney and
ureter, or titles in “other genitourinary
conditions” which apply to both sexes.
The 1973 Health Interview Survey

® There is some diagnostic evidence for teeth disorders, which are a small component of “other digestive system conditions.” For most ages, a larger per

cent of females than males have diagnosed periodontal disease (Kelly and VanKirk, 1965).

294

queried genitourinary symptoms. When
results are published, a comparison of sex
differentials for symptoms and limiting
symptoms (Table 6) can be made for these
two condition groups.

Finally, sex differentials in physical
morbidity for acute conditions (infective/
parasitic, respiratory, digestive) for the
total U. S. population have not been
found. The importance of interview and
illness behavior for these conditions may
be especially great. Acute conditions are
transient and uncomfortable, but they seldom force restricted activity. Chronic
conditions are not easy to forget, and they
often pose unavoidable barriers to activities and mobility. Sex differences in
interview behavior and health socialization can be expressed more easily for acute
conditions than for chronic ones.

In summary, for conditions with clinical
data for the U. S. population, the sex reversal disappears. Males tend to have
higher (or equal) morbidity rates and
higher mortality rates than females. Female reporting inflates the health survey
rates and causes the reversal. If clinical
data were found for the other conditions,
the same results might appear. But what if
a sex reversal persists between clinical
rates and mortality rates? This is possible,
if the sex with higher morbidity (most
likely, females) obtains earlier diagnosis
and control of a disease or if the sex has an
intrinsic resistance to degeneration from
the disease. If either medical attention or
genetic factors make female cases less severe than male cases, females can have
lower death rates even though their prevalence rates are higher. This situation has
not been found in the data, but it is plausible and consistent with females’: higher
utilization of medical services, as reported
in Aday and Eichhorn (1972) and Andersen et al. (1972).

If female interview and illness behavior
produce inflated morbidity reports, the

Verbrugge

Social Biology

inflation should appear for all conditions,
not only the nine with sex reversals. Indeed, if we look at the top panel of Table
7, sex mortality ratios tend to be closer to
1.00 for most illness conditions than for

comparable mortality conditions (see
tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus, heart
conditions, chronic bronchitis/emphy
sema/asthma, peptic ulcer, injuries, and
hemorrhoids). Possible, females’ reporting
behavior partially closes the gap which
would exist in physical morbidity data:?

CONCLUSIONS

This analysis demonstrates a worsening
of male mortality risks relative to female
risks in the United States between 1958
and 1972. Trends for chronic morbidity
also show an increasing disadvantage of
males, compared to females. For the leading causes of death, males tend to have
higher morbidity rates as well as higher
mortality rates.

The apparent contradiction (higher
acute incidence rates and chronic prevalence rates for females, but lower death
rates) is readily answered by disaggregation. Acute conditions are the most common causes of illness, but are rarely causes
of death. Chronic conditions are rather
infrequent causes of illness, but are principal causes of death. The different
weighting of titles to produce aggregate
morbidity and mortality rates largely accounts for the aggregate sex reversal. Diseases with a male excess are weighted
heavily in mortality. Those with a female
excess dominate morbidity.

But sex reversals in specific titles are
also a cause of the aggregate reversal. Examining these, we are obliged to acknowledge that the Health Interview Survey is a

9 The expectation that females inflate reports for
all conditions is simplistic. Certain conditions may be
more “embarrassing” to admit than others. If females
are less sensitive to embarrassment, their reports will
be especially inflated for these conditions, compared
to males.

social record of illness, not a purely
epidemiological one. Comparing sex differentials produced by survey and clinical
data, the tendency of females to inflate
illness reports is revealed. This inflation
seems pervasive, appearing in virtually all
specific conditions studied. How much
this inflation is due to females’ greater responsiveness in the interview, more selfreporting, higher symptom perception,
stronger socialization about health care, or
more freedom to take health action when
ill is not known, The answer can only be
found in individual-level data and through
