ABSTRACT: There is considerable variation in the length of the postpartum amenorrhea during
which breastfeeding suppresses fertility, both within and between societies. In this paper, we
investigate the association between breastfeeding and the resumption of menses and the impact
of various biological and social covariates thereon, using data from two retrospective surveys in
India. We use both univariate life table and multivariate time-dependent hazards techniques to
analyze the data. Most prior investigations related the impact of breastfeeding to postpartum
amenorrhea by taking duration of breastfeeding as a fixed covariate. However, breastfeeding
beyond the resumption of menstruation cannot affect the duration of menses. Accordingly, the
present study has a methodological focus in the sense that breastfeeding is treated as a timedependent covariate. We found that breastfeeding, age of mother at child’s birth, social status,
level of income, religion and caste (subcaste), and residential status have significant effects on
return of menses in Indian traditional society.

of breastfeeding increases the average
birth interval by 0.25 to 0.50 months
(Jain and Bongaarts, 1982; Smith,
1985). The exact physiological mechanism by which breastfeeding affects
postpartum menstruation are yet to be
fully ascertained. Research has shown
that suppression of ovulation operates
through stimulation of the nipples
either via direct neural pathways,
—through the release of the pituitary
“hormone prolactin, or both. The frequency and intensity of suckling as well
Sas the time between breastfeeding sesSsions are thought to be determinants of
othe process. Maternal nutrition may
nalso play a part, so that diet and physical activity levels of the mother need
~t0 be considered as possible influences.
gin traditional societies, the poorer segsqments of populations from developing
countries where demand feeding is the
Stule, it is extremely difficult to collect
‘sinformation on the impact of supplementary feeding on the frequency or
“on the duration of suckling.
While there are a number of studies
~from other countries showing the linkZage between breastfeeding and postSpartum infertility, only a few have
been undertaken in India. Further,
‘emany authors have used proportional
shazards models that take breastfeeding
Aas a fixed covariate to study the effect
of breastfeeding on PPA. When the
breastfeeding period is long, menses
are likely to return while the mother
is still breastfeeding. The duration of
breastfeeding thus may exceed the duration of PPA. Hence, the results from
taking breastfeeding as a fixed covariate may be biased due to that fact
that there is no effect of breastfeeding
on the PPA after resumption of
menses. Jones (1990) employed time

dependent multivariate hazards model
to examine effects of breastfeeding and
various breastfeeding covariates on the
return of menses based on longitudinal
Indonesian data. No such study has
been reported for Indian data.

This paper analyzes breastfeeding,
the mechanisms that influence PPA,
and the role of biological and sociocultural variables on resumption of postpartum menstruation in traditional Indian society using data collected in
two states, Assam and Uttar Pradesh
(UP). The study also has a methodological focus. We demonstrate that
the use of multivariate hazards models
permits detailed and penetrating analysis in which breastfeeding and its interactive variables are constructed in
a time-dependent specification. The
present analysis also is concerned with
the behavior of PPA for those mothers
who experienced return of menses
while breastfeeding and/or were amenorrheic and breastfeeding stopped.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data for research presented in
this paper derives from two retrospective surveys: (1) a study on effects
of socioeconomic factors on fertility
among scheduled caste populations in
the rural areas of Karimganj district,
Assam, conducted during 1988-89
(reference date of the survey, June 15,
1988) under the auspices of University Grants Commission (UGC), New
Delhi, and (2) effects of socioeconomic
factors on determinants of fertility in
eastern Uttar Pradesh carried out
during 1987-88 (reference date of the
survey, October 1, 1987) under the financial support of the Indian Council
of Medical Research (ICMR). The

common objectives of these two surveys were to obtain reliable data relating to fertility to facilitate the study of
socioeconomic and behavioral factors
affecting fertility and the estimation of
biocultural parameters of human reproduction in traditional societies.

Several sociocultural, economic,
and other factors accounting for variation in duration of lactation and fertility were also taken into account. In
addition to other information, we collected data relating to age at marriage
and total number of children ever born
and surviving, including details about
duration variables—lactation, PPA, et
cetera—for births occurring within the
last seven years for each married eligible female in the household. A couple
(or female) was defined eligible if both
the partners were alive on the reference data and the female was less than
age 50. Couples who did not adopt any
method of family planning to space and
limit births and in which both husband
and wife were normal residents of the
village constitute the sample studied in
the present analysis. Information on
the status of women—menstruating,
pregnant, amenorrheic, menopausal
—on the reference date was obtained,
and those who had attained menopause were excluded.

The Assam survey is confined to the
scheduled caste population—the backward and economically deprived class
in India. Karimganj district situated in
the southern part of Assam is predominantly a Bengali-speaking area, where
a large number of villages are identified as scheduled caste villages. If at
least ten per cent of the village population belongs to the scheduled caste,
the village is considered as a scheduled
caste village by the Directorate of Eco
Social Biology

nomics and Statistics, Assam. From
the list of scheduled caste villages of
the district, a sample of 39 villages was
selected by the method of simple random sampling. Then all the scheduled
caste households of the selected villages were enumerated. In the ICMR
survey a sample of 19, 8, and 29 villages was selected respectively from rural areas of Varanasi, Ghazipur, and
Azamgarh districts of the Eastern Uttar Pradesh (UP), predominantly a
Hindi-speaking area. The surveys included 1,805 scheduled caste households from selected villages in the
UGC survey in Assam and 3,931
households in the ICMR survey in UP.

The Assam survey was restricted to
the scheduled caste population, so a
grouping of subcastes was done for the
analysis, each subcaste having its own
distinct social organization and culture. Educational attainment among
these people is very low, and most are
still engaged in traditional occupations. Only a small number of persons
were employed in government or nontraditional private sector jobs. They
are placed in the lowest class of Hindu
society. On the basis of per capita income (PCI) in rupees, four economic
groups were formulated: (1) 50 Rs. or
less, (2) between 50 and 75 Rs., (3) between 75 and 100 Rs., and (4) more
than 100 Rs.

Several factors affect the social status
of the household. The expenditure of
rural households is determined not only
by their income but also by their aspirations of either maintaining their status
or achieving upward social mobility. In
the UP study, women were classified
into three social-status groups: low, medium, and high by an aggregated score
that takes into account of following fac

tors: (a) total household income, (bd)
household educational status, (c) housing, (d ) landholding, and (e) possession
of luxuries (for details, see Singh,
1990). The caste has a socioreligious
base. Therefore, according to the proximity of social position, the UP sample
has been subdivided into broad groups
of upper castes, middle castes, scheduled castes, and Muslims.
< Age of mother at birth of child is
known to be an important determinant
of PPA. In countries, such as India,
Ewhere preference for male children exists, it is believed that the breastfeedxing pattern depends on the infant’s sex.
In the present study, we examine the
~roles of women’s age and child’s sex on
"the duration of PPA.

ANALYTICAL METHODS

Michigan] a

We used life table analysis (Kalb‘=fleisch and Prentice, 1980) in this study
to assess the median duration of PPA
<and breastfeeding, and the proportion
‘of females resuming menses before
fixed periods. This method makes it
Zpossible to include data for those
women who have not yet resumed
‘gmenses or those who have not yet ter“eminated breastfeeding.
= Because of the interrelationship between many of the variables under
study, the use of life tables alone does
not show which factors are independently affecting the duration of PPA.
Factors other than simple lactational
status that might have an additional independent effect on the return of
menses can be identified through the
application of a multivariate hazards
model, a nonlinear regression technique which builds on a product-limit
life table (Cox, 1972). The value of this

Postpartum Amenorrhea 77

technique is that it permits a regression
analysis of censored data and provides
an estimate of the relative magnitudes
of the hazards to which different subgroups are subject.

In the present analysis, the principal
covariate of interest, the variable
breastfeeding, is time-dependent in nature. Hence, special statistical procedures need to be used to examine the
effects of breastfeeding on the PPA. To
overcome the problems of timedependency of the independent variable(s) and of the varying lengths of
time for which women were exposed to
the risk of menstruation, the assumption that the effects of the breastfeeding
covariate on an individual’s failure
probabilities are constant over the duration can be relaxed. The model allows
for time-dependency, either by redefining a covariate as a function of time
elapsed since the reference event, or by
introducing a variable that takes account of the individual’s status on some
process ancillary to that being studied.

Two types of hazards function denoted by hA(t,z), the instantaneous failure rate of PPA at time ¢ for a female,
are represented by

h(t,z) =ho(expiZB, + B2B()} 1)
h(t,z) =ho(texp{ZB, +B;D(0} (2)
where h(t) is the time-varying baseline
hazards function calculated for a specified reference group, and Z=(z,, 2»,
... 5 2} is a set of fixed explanatory
variables. In Model 1, B(t) is a dichotomous variable which is equal to unity
at failure times (return to menses) if
weaning occurs before resumption of
menses and equals zero otherwise. In
Model 2, D(t) is the time point of consideration for those who still are
breastfeeding. B,, B., and B3 are vectors of unknown regression coefficients

to be estimated. The hazards function
allows estimation of the relative risks
of the other groups in relation to the
baseline group by the exponent of the
regression coefficients, exp(.). Each element of the coefficients exp(.) represents the effect of the covariate on the
hazards function for the reference
group. When there is no covariate
present, the exp(.) term reduces to
unity. Values greater than unity indicate an increase in the relative risk of
resumption of menses for this group,
compared with the reference group,
whereas values less than unity indicate
a decrease in the risk.

RESULTS

Median durations of breastfeeding
calculated by univariate life table techniques, for Assam and UP, are presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
The overall median durations of
breastfeeding for females in Assam
and UP are 16 and 27.33 months, respectively. For every specific characteristic of females in this study, the median duration of breastfeeding was
longer in UP than Assam. There was a
maximum variation of six months
among the subgroups in median duration of breastfeeding in both states.
For Assam, the maximum variation
was exhibited among __ subcastes,
whereas in UP it was among castes.
The average duration of breastfeeding
following a male child was longer than
that following a female child. There is
a strong tendency toward the shorter
duration of breastfeeding for the
younger age groups of mothers.

The nonparametric generalized Wilcoxon Test was applied to ascertain
whether the differences among the

strata classifications of different subgroups regarding breastfeeding patterns are statistically significant. We
found that the classification of mothers
according to age of female at the time
of child’s birth, subcaste, religion, and
caste produced statistically significant
differences in the length of breastfeeding (not shown in the table) for both
Assam and UP. In addition, for UP,
social status, area of residence, and
mother’s education had _ significant
bearing on the length of breastfeeding.

Life table estimates of median duration of PPA and the proportion of
women returning to menses (for selected months) calculated for Assam
and UP are also presented in Tables 1
and 2, respectively. The overall median duration of PPA for Assam and
UP is longer (by more than three
months) for Bengali-speaking mothers. Tables 1 and 2 exhibit much variation in the median lengths of PPA
according to different selected sociodemographic characteristics of females. The variations in the median
duration of PPA under different characteristics for Assam data are about
four months, whereas for UP they are
more than ten months. Hence, for testing the significance of group homogeneity, the Generalized Wilcoxon Test
was applied. The groupings of PPA according to the age of female at birth,
subcaste, and household income for
Assam and age of female at birth, religion and caste, social status, area of
residence, and wife’s education for UP
are Statistically significant.

Substantial variation in the duration
of PPA among the subgroups can
be seen in Table 2 for the UP population. The length of PPA for females
of high-social-status households is

approximately one-fourth of that of
females from low-social-status households. Also, the average duration of
PPA for upper-caste Hindu females is
only one-sixth that of scheduled-caste
Hindu females. If only scheduled
castes in both populations are compared, the median duration of PPA for
Assam is shorter than that for UP. In
both states, as age of mother’s cohort
at birth increased, PPA also increases.
It can be seen that there is a correlation
between resumption of menses and (1)
age of female at birth, (2) mother’s education level, (3) social and economic
condition of the household and (4) religion and caste (subcaste).

The proportion of females returning
to menses according to all specified
characteristics in 3, 6, and 12 months is
smaller for Assam than for UP, but this
finding reverses for 18 months. More
than 90 per cent of Bengali females had
failed to return to menses at 3 months,
whereas at 18 months more than 90 per
cent had returned to menses. The corresponding figures for Hindu-speaking
females are more than 50 per cent and
more than 87 per cent, respectively.

Results from multivariate hazards
analysis considering breastfeeding as a
time-dependent dichotomous covariate (Model 1) are presented in Tables
3 and 4, for Assam and UP, respectively. After controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, we find by
regression analysis that breastfeeding
women at any given time are significantly less likely to bear a child than
the women who are not breastfeeding
at that time. Mothers having characteristics like a birth at younger ages and
higher social status have a statistically
significant greater risk of returning to
menses. The risk of return to menses

Postpartum Amenorrhea

81

also varies significantly by religion and
caste (subcaste) and area of residence.
In the present analysis, sex of child and
mother’s education has no significant
explanatory effect on resumption of
menses. Further, it is estimated and
found that the interactions of breastfeeding status and other covariates are
not statistically significant (not shown
in the table).

In Tables 3 and 4, we report the
results of fitting Model 2 specifying
duration of breastfeeding as a
time-dependent variable. We find that
breastfeeding duration has a significant
negative effect on the risk of return of
menses. For every additional month of
breastfeeding, there is about a 1.1 (2.7)
per cent reduction in risk of return to
menses for Assam (UP) mothers.
Thus, for Hindi-speaking women, a
woman breastfeeding for one year has
a relative risk of return to menses of
0.87 (0.72) compared to the risk for
women who never breastfed. The relative risks of return to menses are high
for females in age-at-birth groups 1, 2,
and 3 compared to those in age group
4, The risk of returning to menses was
high for a female following a male
birth. Females from lower income
groups of scheduled castes have a
higher risk of returning to menses than
females from the highest income
group. Scheduled castes (UP), the
middle caste, and Muslim women have
a slower pace of returning to menses
than upper caste Hindus. Among
scheduled castes, the Kaibarta/Other
subcastes have a higher/lower risk of
resuming menses than the Namasudra.
A female resident of Ghazipur/
Azamgarh has 1.17/1.1 times the risk
of returning to menses as compared to
a female resident of Varanasi.

DISCUSSION

In India, breastfeeding is an important part of the emotional bonding
between mother and child and is preferred to other types of feeding. Children are normally fed on demand and
night feeding is common since the baby
sleeps with the mother. It is also common for complete weaning to occur
only when the mother is again pregnant, although it rarely occurs before
the child reaches a particular age. In
the community under study, we found
that breastfeeding is common and
lengthy with most children receiving
breast milk for more than one year in
Assam and more than two years in UP.

Median duration of PPA for Assam
was found to be longer than UP by
more than three months. Results from
other studies based on Indian data are
consistent with our findings (Potter et
al., 1965; Srinivasan et al., 1989). We
note a similarity between living conditions of lower social classes in European countries in the nineteenth century and in developing countries today.
A Norwegian study (Liestol et al.,
1988) based on _ nineteenth-century
data also support this comparison.

The median duration of PPA found
in India in the present study is shorter
than that found in studies based on
Bangladesh (Huffman et al., 1987a)
and Indonesia (Jones, 1989). Average
duration was about 1.7 times longer in
UP than Assam. In the absence of data
on the suckling pattern and amount of
supplementation, it is difficult to analyze causes of these differences in the
duration of PPA. Also, if we compare
the duration of PPA for scheduled
castes in both states, we find that the
duration of PPA is longer in UP than

 

Social Biology

Assam. The subgroup scheduled caste
is found to have the longest duration of
PPA in UP. One possible explanation
might be longer night nursing among
scheduled-caste women.

The existence of distinct subgroups
of women with significantly different
rates of return of the menses, even
though they are breastfeeding, is consistent with the observation that actual
breastfeeding behavior is not homogeneous across the study group. The
present study did not provide any
information about supplementation
or child’s suckling habits. Younger,
higher-social-status and upper-caste
women may offer food supplementation earlier than other groups, because
they can afford it. Thus, they may have
slightly shorter average breastfeeding
durations and fewer night-time sessions than other groups which may be
one of the causes of shorter PPA for
these subgroups.

On the other hand, several studies
(Lunn et al., 1980, 1981; Ramchandran, 1987; Huffman et al., 19875) suggest that maternal nutritional status
may have a role in determining the return to fertility. Women belonging to
higher status groups usually get more
nutritious food and better medical care
than others. There has been speculation that the return of menstruation
during lactation may be delayed in undernourished women. This delay may
be due to the fact that poorly nourished
mothers produce less milk and might
thus have hungrier babies who suckle
more frequently and intensively, thus
lengthening the duration of PPA. As
shown in other studies, we found that
amenorrhea lasted longer for older
women than younger women. This
longer amenorrhea may reflect a bio

logical delay in hormonal mechanisms
responsible for ovulation.

As expected, we observe that the
duration of the postpartum infertile period is much shorter than breastfeeding. It is well documented that prolonged and intensive breastfeeding
increases the duration of PPA. By
constructing time-dependent specification of multivariate hazards models,

‘Owe investigated the effects of breastSifeeding on the duration of PPA in
more specific ways than have other reEsearchers. We observed that the cur3 rent status as well as duration of breastO feeding had a profound impact on the
< duration of PPA in a population where
lengthy and intensive breastfeeding is
a norm, after controlling sociodemo“graphic variables under study. We also
examined the interactive effects of
‘cbreastfeeding status and duration in a
‘S time-dependent setting with other ex«splanatory variables (not shown), but

the interaction effects were found statistically insignificant. Breastfeeding
and amenorrhea are undeniably correlated. Mothers belonging to a birth cohort group of 30 years of age and over
experienced a slower rate of return to
menses. In contrast, high-social-status
and upper-caste females exhibited a
faster rate of return to menses. Before
drawing any final conclusions, however, we feel that further studies are
necessary which consider simultaneously the nutritional status of both
mother and child and the breastfeeding
pattern in a traditional society.
