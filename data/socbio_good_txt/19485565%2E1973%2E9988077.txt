A Comparative Study of Fertility in

Mexico City and Caracas

Maria Davidson

International Statistical Programs Center
United States Bureau of the Census
Washington, D.C.

This paper compares the variations in
fertility among women in Mexico City,
Mexico, with those among women in
Caracas, Venezuela, in relation to certain
factors such as age at marriage, education
of woman, occupation of husband, labor
force status of women, religiosity, and
ideal and desired number of children.

DATA AND METHODS

The data for this paper are based on fertility surveys conducted by CELADE
(Centro Latinoamericano de Demografia)
during 1963-64. These surveys included
capital cities and selected small urban and
rural areas in seven Latin American countries. The objectives of these surveys and
a preliminary analysis of fertility in relation to certain factors have been reported
for three of the cities by Miro and Rath
(1965). Later, Miro and Mertens (1968)
analyzed fertility in relation to socioeconomic and attitudinal factors for all areas
covered in the surveys. Among other
studies based on the CELADE fertility
surveys two are especially pertinent since
they deal with data similar to those examined in this paper. One study is on the
reproductive behavior of women in Mexico
City, (Benitez Zenteno, 1970) and the

 

other deals with the fertility of women in
the Metropolitan Area of Caracas (Direccion General de Estadistica y Censos Nacionales, 1967).

This paper is concerned with the reproductive behavior of ever-married women.
The surveyed women in common-law marriages in Mexico City and Caracas are not
considered in this paper because they are
too few for the necessary cross-classifications. Thus, this paper is concerned primarily with factors related to the fertility
of ever-married women, ie., those in or
previously in legal unions.

The analysis utilizes the cross-sectional
method and the multiple regression technique. The cross-sectional method includes
mostly ever-married women. In the regression technique, the data are restricted
to married women with husband present.
Attention may first be given to the cumulative fertility of women in the two cities.

Cumulative fertility. It may be noticed
from Table 1 that the cumulative fertility
rates for all women and for ever-married
women tend to be higher in Mexico City
than in Caracas. For total women, the
excess is largest at ages 40-44 (29%) and
nonexistent at ages 30-34. Among those
ever-married women in Mexico City 25

__ * Because of the relatively high number of children ever born to women in consensual unions jn Caracas, the fertility rates for total women are close to those for ever-married women,

29, 40-44 and 45-49 years old, the excess
in fertility over their counterparts in
Caracas was by more than one child, The
considerably lower fertility of ever-married
women in Caracas may perhaps be explained by the relatively high percentage
of foreign-born (20%) in the population
compared with a low percentage (2%) in
Mexico City. The foreign-born persons in
Caracas are of European extraction; they
came to Venezuela either shortly before
or after World War II. They are generally
better educated and less fertile than the
native population. Since Mexico City is a
large, industrialized, modern city, one
might have expected lower fertility there
than in Caracas at least for women at
younger ages. However, even young women
in Mexico City are quite fertile. The available data do not offer an explanation for
the relatively high fertility of women in
Mexico City.

The average fertility differences between
Mexico City and Caracas became even
more striking in the distributions of
women by number of children ever born.
Thus, in Mexico City in 1964 the percentage childless among  ever-married

women 45~49 years old was 3.7% compared with 6.3% in Caracas and the percentage of women with six or more children in Mexico City was 37.6% compared
with 33.2% in Caracas.

To gain a better understanding of the
fertility pattern of women in Mexico City
and Caracas, it may be useful to examine
the parity progression ratios. It should be
mentioned that the parity progression ratios cannot be considered final except in
the case of women who completed childbearing. As expected, the parity progression ratios for women in Mexico City and
Caracas tend to decline with increasing
birth order, Nevertheless, the ratios tend
to be higher for Mexico City than Caracas
at the various ages and parities. For
women in Caracas the 4 to 5 ratio was
lower than 3 to 4 ratio for all except two
of the five-year age groups considered,
whereas for women in Mexico City this
held true for only three of the age groups
(see Table 2).

In measuring fertility, it is important to
consider age at marriage. Age at marriage
is, of course, simply the difference between
current age and the number of years

since the (first) marriage. In general, the
younger the woman marries, the more
children she has. First, women who marry
at an early age are at risk of childbearing
for a longer time than those who marry
later. Also they are usually of lower socioeconomic status, characteristics that are
associated with high fertility.

We may notice from Table 3 that the
cumulative fertility of ever-married women
standardized for age declines sharply with
increasing age at marriage in both Mexico
City and Caracas, Again, however, the fertility rates are higher for Mexico City
women than for Caracas women of comparable age and age at marriage. Specifi

cally, the excess of the fertility rate for
women.in Mexico City over that in Caracas is 10% for those who married at ages
below 18, 19% for those who married at
ages 18-19, 22% for those who married at
ages 20-21, and 39% for those married
at ages 25 and over. The data in Table 3
suggest that an efficient way of lowering
fertility is through an increasing age at
marriage. The latter is accomplished by
raising the level of educational attainment,
a factor that is next considered.

Education. Among social factors influencing fertility, education is frequently
mentioned as the most important. In general, fertility is inversely related to education. Women of high educational attainment tend to be less fertile than those of
low education. First, they tend to marry
later and, second, they are more efficient
in controlling family size. It may be noticed from Table 4 that at all educational
levels fertility rates are higher for evermarried women in Mexico City than for
those in Caracas. The excess is greatest
at the lowest educational level and smallest
at the highest levels. Thus, ever-married
women in Mexico City with secondary or
university education are but little more
fertile than women of corresponding educational attainment in Caracas.

‘It may be of interest to note that in
Mexico City and Caracas ever-married

women of low educational attainment contributed the highest proportion of children
ever born to their respective age groups.
For example, in Mexico City among women
25-29 years old 69% had no more than
primary schooling but contributed 75%
of all births to this age group. A similar
situation prevailed in Caracas. There,
among ever-married women 25-29 years
old, 68% had at most primary schooling
but contributed 74% of all births to this
age group. Among women 35-39 years old
in Mexico City, 72% had no more than
primary school but had borne 78% of all
children to this age group, whereas in Caracas among the 35-39 age group 75%
had no more than primary schooling but
contributed 78% of all births. Of women
45-49 years old in Mexico City, 74% had
at most primary schooling but contributed
83% of all births, whereas among women
of comparable age in Caracas 84% had at
most primary school education but had
produced 90% of all births to this age
group.

Husband’s occupation, It has long been
noted that occupation of husband has a
bearing on fertility of the woman. The
major difficulty arising from the use of
husband’s occupation is that a person often
does not remain in the same occupation
during his lifetime; it often happens that
the occupation of husband at the time of

the survey is not the same as at the time
of the birth of the child. Without complete
occupational histories it is impossible to
make corrections and to know the extent
of these changes in the occupation.
Despite these difficulties, the relationship between husband’s occupation and
fertility is revealing. It is a well-established
fact that the occupational status like educational attainment is inversely related to
fertility. This holds true for Mexico City
and Caracas. Also, at each occupational
level the fertility of couples in Mexico
City surpassed that of couples in Caracas.
As with education, the per cent excess was
inversely related to occupational class.
Women in Mexico City whose husbands
were in higher nonmanual occupations
were by 11% more fertile than women
whose husbands were in the corresponding
occupational group in Caracas; the excess
increased to 26% for wives with husbands
in lower nonmanual occupations and
reached 31% for wives with husbands in
manual occupations (see Table 5).

low fertility for whatever reason and thus
have the freedom to work. There are still
other women who work because they have
more children than their husbands can
support. The problem of causal sequences
can be resolved only in a longitudinal
study.

From the data shown in Table 6 it may
be noticed that relatively small proportions of women in Mexico City and in Caracas are working either at home or outside
the home. First, the majority of women in
Mexico City and in Caracas do not have
the necessary skills to be gainfully employed, and second, the norms of the society do not encourage married women
to be gainfully employed. Nevertheless,
ever-married women who work outside
the home are much less fertile than those
who do not work. In Mexico City, the
age-standardized cumulative fertility of
wives working at home is 6% higher than
that of nonworking wives (Table 6). One
could speculate that wives working at
home do mostly semiskilled or unskilled

Employment of wife. The relationship
between fertility and the wife’s work history is difficult to interpret not only because of the age factor but also, and primarily, because of the interrelations
between fertility and employment. Many
women wish to work and therefore try to
restrict their fertility. Other women have

associated with high fertility. In Caracas,
the data follow the expected pattern more
clearly but not completely. Nonworking

for wives working at home is actually a
little lower than that for wives working
outside the home. Each of the last two

numbers.

Table 7 presents age-specific fertility
rates by employment status of wives. The
last column shows per cent excess of the
fertility of the nonworking wives over that
of working wives. It may be noticed that
in Mexico City the average cumulative
fertility of nonworking wives is 2% lower
than that of working wives and the fertility of nonworking wives 20-24 years old
is 3% lower than that of working wives

in the corresponding age group. In most
of the older ages, the difference is in the
other direction but the excess fertility of
the nonworking wives does not exceed
14%.

In contrast, the excess fertility of nonworking wives is quite large in Caracas.
In the age group 20-24, the nonworking
wives in Mexico City show a 3% deficit
in fertility compared with a 65% excess
in fertility for the corresponding age group
of wives in Caracas. At ages 45-49, the

fertility of the nonworking wives in Mexico City is 1% lower than that of working
wives, whereas the fertility of the nonworking wives in Caracas in the comparable age group is 42% in excess of that of
working wives (Table 7). Our data do not
afford an explanation of the fertility behavior of working wives in Mexico City.
As already noticed, in Mexico City in contrast to Caracas there is in general a rather
small excess in fertility of nonworking over
working wives. To find an answer to this
puzzling problem one probably should
study the family structure in Mexico City.

Religiosity. Religion is almost universally found to be an important factor
affecting the reproductive behavior of couples. This may be particularly true of
Catholicism because the Catholic doctrine
teaches couples not to prevent births of
children except for important reasons. In
addition, there are official prohibitions
against the use of artificial means of birth
control, and this makes family planning
difficult for Catholics who respect these
proscriptions. There is, for example, in
the United States a persistent excess in
fertility among Catholic couples as compared with other religious groups. In the
United States the frequency of church
attendance tends to be directly related
to fertility, especially among Catholics.
However, church attendance is only one
component of religiosity (Ryder and Wes
Davidson

Social Biology

toff, 1971, p. 71). In this paper, religiosity
is measured by frequency of church attendance. Its scale is: once a week or
more, once or twice a month, less often,
never, not stated, no religion. The last
three categories were excluded in our tabulations because of very few cases.

The relationship between age-standardized cumulative fertility and religious participation is shown in Table 8. As noticed,
in Mexico City the cumulative fertility of
wives attending church once a week or
more is lower than that of wives attending
church once or twice a month or “less
often.” The fertility of wives in the last
two categories is practically the same. In
Caracas there is no difference between
fertility of wives attending church once a
week or more or once or twice a month.
However, wives who attend church “less
often” show a 31% excess in fertility over
those who attend church once or twice a
month.

In an attempt to explain this peculiar
relationship, the data on church attendance
were cross-classified by education. In Table 9, age-standardized fertility is shown
for ever-married women cross-classified by
education and religious participation. Because of the few cases, the three categories
“some secondary, completed secondary and
some university” were combined, It may
be noted from Table 9 that in Mexico
City and in Caracas wives with “none or

some primary education” who attend
church once a week or more tend to have
lower fertility than those who attend
church once or twice a month. And those
in turn who attend church once or twice
a month tend to have lower fertility than
those who attend church “less often.”
Thus, those who attend church “less often”
have the highest fertility among the three
categories. A plausible explanation for this
type of behavior may be that women with
low educational attainment who have fewer
children are able to attend church services
more often than those in the same educational class with more children.

In Mexico City and in Caracas, women
ever married with completed primary education and also those with secondary and
university education do not show a consistent relationship between frequency of
church attendance and fertility. For example, women in Mexico City with completed primary school who attend church
services once a week or more are the most
fertile. Those who attend church services
“less often” are less fertile, and those who

attend services once or twice a month are
the least fertile. In contrast, in Caracas
women ever married with completed primary education who attend church “less
often” are the most fertile, those who attend church once a week or more are less
fertile, and those who attend church once
or twice a month are the least fertile.
Contrary to expectations, in Mexico
City and Caracas there is no consistent
positive relationship between the frequency of church attendance and fertility.
Moreover, women with fewer children attend church services more frequently than
those with more children, The lack of a
direct association between fertility and
church attendance cannot be attributed
to the fact that better educated women are
more participating. The foregoing analysis
seems to indicate that frequency of church
attendance in itself does not directly influence fertility. There are probably other
intervening factors that neutralize the
effect of religiosity on fertility. A similar

from the 1964 CELADE fertility survey
(Gomez, 1968). In contrast, a study prepared by the Demographic Division of the
Venezuelan Census Office (Direccion General de Estadistica y Censos Nacionales,
1967) based on the 1964 fertility survey
concluded that there exists an inverse relationship between frequency of church
attendance and fertility.

The attitudes of ever-married women in
Mexico City and Caracas toward family
size are discussed in this section. Attitudes
toward and desires concerning family size
were studied in the United States for the
first time in the Indianapolis Study
(Whelpton and Kiser, 1958). Afterwards,
a number of studies concerned with factors
related to fertility included questions on
expected, ideal, and desired family size
(Freedman, Whelpton, and Campbell,
1959; Whelpton, Campbell and Patterson,
1966; Blake, 1966). Attitudes and desires
are of prime importance in determining
average family size in developed countries
where family planning is widely accepted.
For that reason, in fertility surveys women
are often questioned not only on actual
and expected but also on ideal and desired
number of children. The ideals of many
women are for more children than they
feel they can afford. This is not surprising,
because ideals in other areas of life frequently exceed reality.

Introduction of the concepts ideal and
desired number of children into fertility
surveys of developing countries should be
rewarding. Although only a small proportion of women in childbearing ages in these
countries practice birth control, it should
nevertheless be useful to find out how the
ideals and desires deviate from performance. There remains a problem with the
concept “ideal.” As defined in the CELADE
fertility surveys this concept is ambiguous.
The question enabling the respondent to
identify the concept ideal was phrased as

Social Biology

follows: What do you consider a suitable
number of children? One may ask for
whom the number is suitable, for the
women to whom the question is addressed,
for the average woman, or for the total
population. The concept of “ideal” number
of children as defined in the Growth of
American Family Studies was used in a
recent study by Ryder and Westoff.
(1971). They also criticized the concept
as being vague. Despite the deficiencies,
the concept is being used extensively in
the KAP studies.

We may compare briefly the number
of children considered ideal with the desired and actual number for ever-married
women in Mexico City and Caracas, Table 9
shows that the average number of children
considered ideal for ever-married women
in Mexico City is practically constant
for women up to age 39. Afterwards, the
number is somewhat higher. In contrast,
the average number of children considered
ideal for ever-married women in Caracas
is directly related to the age of woman.
This may reflect a decline in the ideal
number of children over the past generation. The average number of desired children differs little from the number considered ideal for women in Mexico City,
whereas in Caracas the average number
of desired children is slightly lower age
for age than the number of children considered ideal, It could be that ever-married
women in Mexico City do not distinguish
between the two concepts or they want a
family size that is considered “ideal.” Concerning the actual number of children, it
may be noticed from Table 10 that in
Mexico City and in Caracas ever-married
women under age 30 have fewer children
than the desired number, at age 30-34 the
actual and the desired number are virtually
the same and for women at older ages the
actual number of children surpassed the
desired number.

MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS

From the analysis of factors related to
fertility of ever-married women in Mexico
City and in Caracas in which we dealt
with only two variables at a time, we
proceed now to a multivariate analysis.
The method used is a linear stepwise regression technique. The independent variables are: age at first marriage, education
of wife, work status of wife, occupational
group of husband, desired number of children by wife. The dependent variable is
the number of children ever born to
women married, husband present. The
partial regression coefficients along with
their standard errors and the multiple regression coefficients are shown in Table
11. Since the calculations are made from
sample data, there is the problem of the
appropriate significance level. As an arbitrary rule, we assumed that a regression
coefficient at least twice as large as its
standard error is significantly different
from zero.

First of all, it will be noticed that for
both cities and for the ages under consideration all predictor variables except desired number of children are inversely
related to fertility as indicated by the
minus sign of the regression coefficient.
Among the five variables, age at marriage
is the only one that had a significant
independent effect on fertility for the wives
20-24 years old in Mexico City and in
Caracas. Although educational attainment
had no independent effect, it had an indirect effect upon fertility in that women
who attend school for many years postpone
their marriage and this delay may lead
to smaller families. For wives 25-29 years
old in Mexico City, age at marriage and
work status of wife had important independent consequences for the number of
children she had. The partial regression
coefficients indicate that a one-year delay
in marriage reduced fertility more than
wife’s work status. For wives 25-29 years
old in Caracas, each of the three factors,

age at marriage, occupation of husband,
and desired number of children had a significant independent effect on fertility.

We have already explained why age at
marriage had an effect on fertility. Concerning occupational status of husbands,
it is plausible that men in higher nonmanual
occupations may have planned and controlled their family’s size in order to be
socially mobile. For wives 30-34 years
old in Mexico City, the only independent
and significant influence on fertility was
age at marriage. The partial regression coefficient for this variable indicates that a
one-year delay in marriage reduced the
fertility of the wife by one child on the
average. In contrast, in Caracas for wives
30-34 years old, three factors, age at marriage, education, and desired number of
children, had independent significant effects on fertility. A one-year delay in marriage reduced the fertility of the 30-34
years old wives by 0.8 of a child, and an
increase of one year’s education reduced
the fertility by 0.3 of a child on the average. The desired number of children had
an independent, small but statistically significant, positive effect on fertility.

For wives 35-39 years old in Mexico
City, the regression equation includes only
three predictor variables, age at marriage,
education, and desired number of children.
Two of these variables, age at marriage
and desired number of children, had an
independent effect on fertility. Work status
of wife and occupation of husband did not
enter into the regression equation, because
the program terminated due to the insufficient level of the F ratio. For wives
35-39 years old in Caracas, the only independent effect on fertility was age at marriage (see Table 11). The other variables
under consideration exerted only an indirect influence on fertility.

From the foregoing analysis, it is clear
that the most important influence on fer
Fertility in Mexico City and Caracas

tility was exercised by age at marriage.
As suggested in a previous section, raising
age at marriage through better education
of women and through stimulating their
interests in careers could bring a lowering
of fertility. These processes are collectively needed for raising levels of living
of individual families and communities
as a whole.

SUMMARY AND FINDINGS

A comparative analysis of fertility behavior in relation to selected characteristics of ever-married women in Mexico City
and in Caracas, and a multivariate analysis of women currently married in the
two cities were presented in this paper. It
was found that the cumulative fertility
of ever-married women in Mexico City
was higher than that of ever-married
women in Caracas. In each city, age at
marriage was inversely related to fertility.
By age at marriage the greatest excess of
fertility in Mexico City over that in Caracas was that for women who married at
age below 18; the lowest excess was that
for women who married at age 25 and
over.

At each educational level, the fertility
of ever-married women in Mexico City
surpassed that of women in Caracas; the
excess in fertility was the greatest at the
lowest educational level and the smallest
at the highest level. In Mexico City and
in Caracas, employment of wives was inversely related to fertility. Again, the fertility of working wives in Mexico City
was considerably higher than that of working wives in Caracas.

As with education and employment of
wives, the level of husband’s occupation
was inversely related to fertility. Religiosity of wives controlled for education
showed no consistent relationship to fertility of ever-married women in either city.
The number of children considered ideal

for ever-married women in Mexico City
was very close to the desired number,
whereas for ever-married women in Caracas
the ideal number of children was larger
than the desired number. The actual number of children for ever-married women in
Mexico City and in Caracas surpassed the
desired number.

The multivariate analysis showed that
for currently married women 20-24 years
old in Mexico City and in Caracas age at

marriage was the most important variable
explaining fertility. For women in older
ages, other variables in addition to age at
marriage, became important in explaining
fertility.
