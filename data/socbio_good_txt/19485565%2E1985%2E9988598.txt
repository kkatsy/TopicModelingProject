ABSTRACT: The perinatal mortality rate is known to increase with parity. This parity effect is
shown to be steepest for ““O”’-type mothers, compared to mothers with blood groups A, B, or
AB. Thus, there is a heightened parity effect in mothers who are likeliest to be antigenically
dissimilar from their fetuses. This model may also be germane to other clinical conditions where
negative parity effects are observed. Matemal-fetal immunoreactivity is a likely explanation for
parity effects on perinatal mortality attributable to ABO incompatibility and may also contribute to the occurrence of negative parity effects in other conditions.

The paradox of pregnancy is that circulating maternal antibodies against the
histocompatibility antigens of the fetus
develop simultaneously with the specific
inhibition of immune reactivity against
the fetus as a graft (Simmons, 1971).
However, there are instances where
mechanisms of fetal immunoprotection
break down. Maternal immune attack
upon the fetus plays a central role in
pathologic conditions like Rh disease,
runt disease, autoimmune thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia, myaesthenia gravis and thyroiditis (Brent,
1971). Spontaneous abortion and perinatal death may also be consequences of
maternal-fetal immunoreactivity.

It is our contention that maternalfetal immunoreactivity may also contribute to other pathologic conditions in
which a “negative parity effect’ is observed. The development of maternal
antibodies to fetal antigens increases
with successive pregnancies (Doughty
and Gelsthrope, 1976), and maternal
immunoreactivity may therefore be expected, in certain circumstances, to ex
129

ert deleterious effects upon the course
or outcome of successive pregnancies.
Negative parity effects, i.e., an increased likelihood of untoward outcome
with increasing birth order, have been
described in connection with stillbirth
and perinatal mortality (Niswander and
Gordon, 1972), mental retardation (BeImont et al., 1972), specific learning disabilities (Nichols and Chen, 1981), infant characteristics (Waldrop and Bell,
1966), height (Belmont et al., 1975),
birth weight and placental size (Vernier,
1975), and IQ (Belmont and Marolla,
1973).

Maternal-fetal ABO incompatibility
is known to occasion an increased incidence of fetal wastage (Cohen, 1970).
Since it is likely that this phenomenon
has an immunoreactive basis, we
thought that perinatal mortality as a
consequence of ABO incompatibility
might be a good mode! for demonstrating how maternal-fetal immunoreactivity may be manifested as a negative parity effect. Since it is already known that
a negative parity effect exists for still

birth and perinatal mortality (Niswander and Gordon, 1972), the demonstration would require that the parity effect
for antigenically incompatible matings
should be demonstrably sharper. With
respect to ABO incompatibility, the
idea would be supported by the demonstration of a greater parity effect on perinatal mortality in children of O-type
mothers.

The data are from the British Perinatal Study (Butler and Bonham, 1963).
The perinatal mortality rate for a sample
of 14,732 pregnancies was related to maternal ABO type and parity (see Table
1). It is found that within each maternal
blood group, the perinatal mortality
rate increases with parity. As predicted,

The significance of this difference
was tested by analysis of variance with
orthogonal polynomial decomposition
(unweighted means). The interaction, birth order (linear) < maternal
ABO status (O vs. A, B, and AB) xX
perinatal mortality rate was significant
(F [1,14730] = 4.30, P< 0.05).

Parity effects on perinatal mortality
are most strongly felt by O mothers,
who are also most prone to develop an
immune reaction to fetal blood group
antigens. Heightened maternal-fetal immunoreactivity is thus manifest in a
sharper parity effect.

ABO Incompatiability 131

Since fetal ABO status was not available in the data base from the British
Perinatal Study, it was not possible to
perform a more incisive analysis of
materna]-fetal ABO incompatibility relative to parity effects and perinatal mortality. Nevertheless, the fact that
maternal-fetal incompatibility can contribute to and be demonstrated in the
slope of the negative parity effect may
be useful to research in other pathologic
conditions where negative parity effects
are known to exist. It is conceivable that
maternal-fetal immunoreactivity may
play a role in their development as well.
