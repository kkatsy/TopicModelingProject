ABSTRACT: A comprehensive benefit-cost analysis of the screening program to detect newborns
with congenital hypothyroidism in Wisconsin is presented. Congenital hypothyroidism, if left
undetected and untreated at an early age, can have serious irreversible effects on the growth and
development of the brain. The monetary costs of the detection and treatment program for congenital hypothyroidism were compared with the projected benefits (avoided costs) that result
from the prevention of the mental retardation associated with the disorder. Future costs and
benefits were determined using a 4 per cent, 7 per cent, and 10 per cent rate of discount. Net
benefits (benefits minus costs) for detecting and treating one individual with congenital hypothyroidism were approximately $98,200 ($141,700 — $43,500) using the 7 per cent rate of discount. Net benefits for detecting the 13 individuals with congenital hypothyroidism in 1981—

 

 

1982 totaled $1,277,000.

Neonatal thyroid screening programs
are designed to prevent congenital hypothyroidism and prevent, through
treatment, the mental retardation and
other serious complications associated
with this disorder. Public acceptance of
screening programs is partly based on
the perception that the costs of the program will be offset by the benefits derived from successfully preventing the
serious consequences of a particular disorder. In general, infant screening programs directed toward the prevention or
early detection and treatment of selected genetic and metabolic disorders
have been demonstrated to be good economic investments in preventive health
care (Barden et al., 1984; Bush et al.,
1973; Conley and Milunsky, 1975; Dussault et al., 19805, Laberge, 1980;
Layde et al., 1979; Scriver et al., 1977).
As concern over rapidly escalating costs
of health care increases, cost-benefit
analysis is increasingly accepted as one
useful way to estimate the potential eco
nomic value of established or projected
health programs. The following report
provides a comprehensive analysis of
the economic costs and benefits of the
program for detecting infants with congential hypothyroidism in Wisconsin.

Congenital hypothyroidism, if left
untreated, can have a devastating effect
on growth and development in general
and on development of the brain and
central nervous system in particular. If
treatment is delayed until clinical signs
of the disorder appear, irreversible
damage to the brain is likely. Unfortunately, during the first 8-12 weeks of
life, only 5 to 15 per cent of infants with
congenital hypothyroidism can be identified using clinical signs alone (Dussault
et al., 1980; Fisher et al., 1979; Mitchell and Larsen, 1980). Because of this
difficulty in early diagnosis, newborn
screening of every infant is a vital necessity.

Screening programs designed to detect congenital hypothyroidism have

185

186 Barden and Kessel

been in existence since 1972. Millions of
infants have been screened in developed
countries throughout the world (DeLange et al., 1979; Dussault et al.,
1980a, 19805; Fisher et al., 1979; Hulse
etal., 1980; Miyai et al., 1978; Walfish et
al., 1980). Approximately one in every
4,000-6,500 infants is born with congenital hypothyroidism. As more countries
initiate screening programs and report
results, considerable population variability may become apparent. Brown et
al. (1981) reported that the incidence of
congenital hypothyroidism was nearly
six times more frequent in white than in
black individuals in Georgia.

Congenital hypothyroidism can
result from a variety of abnormalities of
the thyroid system, including abnormalities of embryogenesis, inborn errors of
thyroid function, and endemic hypothyroidism (Fisher, 1980). Because of the
multiple etiologies of congenital hypothyroidism, in some cases there have
been difficulties in determining the specific cause of the thyroid system dysfunction and in establishing an appropriate
treatment protocol.

Most cases of congenital hypothyroidism are caused by abnormalities of
embryogenesis that result in agenesis,
hypoplasia, or ectopia of the thyroid
gland. These disorders result in primary
congenital hypothyroidism. Secondary
hypothyroidism is caused by disorders
of the pituitary. Thyroid stimulating
hormone (TSH) deficiency and panhypopituitarism are two examples. Tertiary hypothyroidism is the result of abnormalities associated with the
hypothalamus (Price et al., 1981). The
incidence of primary hypothyroidism
(1:4,000) is much greater than the incidence of secondary and tertiary hypothyroidism combined (1:68,000). Goitrous hypothyroidism, caused by defects

Social Biology

in thyroid hormonogenesis, occurs with
an incidence of 1:30,000 (Dussault et
al., 19805; Fisher, 1980).

Congenital hypothyroidism is one of
the most common preventable causes of
mental retardation (Fisher et al., 1979).
Early treatment of hypothyroid infants
is generally effective in preventing the
mental retardation associated with this
disorder (Dussault et al., 1978; Klein et
al., 1972; Raiti and Newns, 1971;
Vanderschueren-Lodeweyckx et al.,
1980). However, one study has indicated that neonatal screening and early
treatment may not be able to prevent
the mental retardation that may occur in
the 3-4 per cent of infants with congenital hypothyroidism who show clinical
signs of the disorder at birth (New England Congenital Hypothyroidism Collaborative, 1981). For these infants the
duration and severity of fetal hypothyroidism is believed to be most important
in determining the outcome of mental
development (Glorieux et al., 1983;
Morreale de Escobar and Escobar del
Rey, 1980).

The protection that early treatment
of congenital hypothyroidism extends to
the development of the brain as manifested by normal IO scores appears to
be somewhat less complete in regard to
the development of later, more subtle
manifestations of neuropsychological
dysfunction. Neuropsychological dysfunctions associated with untreated congenital hypothyroidism include hyperactivity and short attention span,
impaired spatial orientation, difficulties
in fine motor coordination, and difficulties in learning mathematics (New England Congenital Hypothyroid Collaborative, 1981). Infants detected through
the Quebec Network for Genetic Medicine Screening Program and treated at
an early age demonstrated evidence of

Vol. 31, No. 3-4

minimal disorders in the areas of

hearing-speech performance and practi
cal reasoning at the ages of 18 and 36
months (Glorieux et al., 1983). However, because of uncertainty concerning
the reliability of predicting future mental development from tests on children
below 4 years of age, no definitive statement concerning the long-term effects
of congenital hypothyroidism on neuropsychological development was made.
Several other investigators have indicated that impaired brain function was
evident in many hypothyroid subjects,
including some who were treated during
the first month of life (MacFaul, 1978;
Wolter et al., 1980). The conclusion that
may be drawn from these studies is that
early detection and treatment of infants
with clinically unrecognizable congenital hypothyroidism does result in normal
or near normal intelligence, but some
less serious neuropsychological manifestations of the disorder may still occur.

The Wisconsin Infant Health Screening Program for congenital hypothyroidism follows a two-tiered system of
testing in which T4 (thyroxin) is the primary marker and TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) is tested on those individuals with a low T4 value. A similar
procedure is utilized by the New England Regional Hypothyroid Screening
program (Mitchell and Larson, 1980).
The flow diagram for the Wisconsin testing program appears in Figure 1.
Briefly, the blood specimen is collected
by hospital staff on standardized filter
paper and sent to the Wisconsin State
Laboratory of Hygiene for analysis. T4
is tested by a commercially available radioimmunoassay test (Immunospot™ T4,
Meloy Lab, Virginia). TSH testing utilizes the Neonatal TSH Kit (Diagnostics
Product Corporation, Los Angeles, California). If the initial test for T4 is in the

Congenital Hypothyroidism

187

lower 10 per cent of the T4 assays for a
particular day, further analysis is done.
If the T4 result is in the lower 10 per cent
of samples and greater than 8.0 ug/dl,
and a subsequent TSH assay is less than

20 ulU/ml, the sample is normal. If the

TSH result is greater than 20 ulU/ml,
the sample is abnormal and the child is
considered to have hypothyroidism. If
the initial T4 assay is in the lower 10 per
cent of assays and is less than 8.0 ug/dl, a
repeat T4 assay and a TSH assay are
completed. If the second T4 result is
greater than 8.0 ug/di and the TSH
result is less than 20.0 ulU/ml, the sample is normal. However, if the TSH
result is greater than 20.0 uIU/ml the
sample is considered abnormal. If the
T4 result is less than 8.0 ug/d! on either
the initial or repeat test, but the TSH
result is less than 20.0 ulU/ml, the sample is reported to be possibly abnormal.
Once an abnormal sample is found, the
child’s physician is contacted by phone
and is sent a written report indicating
this finding. The physician is then responsible for following through with
subsequent tests to verify the results.

COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS

Cost-benefit analysis 1s one method
of estimating the potential economic
costs and benefits of a particular program. In the case of screening for congenital hypothyroidism, the program
costs represent the value of resources
used to detect and treat individuals with
the disorder. Program costs are compared with the avoided costs (benefits)
that result from the early detection,
treatment, and prevention of the many
developmental abnormalities associated
with the disorder if undetected and/or
untreated. These benefits include
avoided costs of institutionalization and
other residential care and services af

the present analysis, a net benefit value Program costs are presented as the

cost per sample and the cost to detect
one individual with congenital hypothyroidism. Benefits are presented as the
total avoided costs that result from the
detection and successful treatment of
each individual with congenital hypothyroidism. All values are expressed in
1982 dollars. If 1982 values were not
available, the most recent figures were
inflated to 1982 levels by using the gross
national product deflator for each intervening year (Statistical Abstracts of the
United States, 1981).

Because not all costs and benefits occur simultaneously, cost-benefit analyses must achieve comparability between
present costs and costs that take place in
future years by discounting the value of
future costs and benefits to present values. Discounting is necessary because a
given amount of money available today
is worth more than that same amount at
some time in the future. The difference
between the present value and the value
of that cost or benefit in the future represents the lost opportunity value of the
money involved. Assuming a 7 per cent
interest rate, we find that a $1,000
benefit that occurs in one year’s time is
worth only $935 in terms of present
value; a $935 investment today would be
worth $1,000 in one year’s time. The discounted present value (7 per cent discount rate) of a $1,000 benefit that takes
place in 10 year’s time is worth only
$508. The present value of $Y accruing
in n years at a discount rate of 7 per cent
is calculated as $ Y/(1.07)" (Hartunian et
al., 1981). Because of discounting future
costs and benefits to present value, costs
that take place in the distant future are
relatively less significant in terms of
present value than costs and benefits
that occur in the present or near future
(see Eastaugh, 1981, for a discussion of
discount rates).

Congenital Hypothyroidism

The appropriate discount rate to use
in cost-benefit analysis is a matter of
some concern. A high discount rate will
cause programs with high present costs
and with benefits that occur in the future
to be less attractive economically than
programs with similar costs and benefits
occurring in the present or near future.
Low discount rates give more weight to
costs that must be borne by individuals
of future generations. Some investigators feel that the discount rate should
reflect the average rate of growth of the
gross national product, i.e., 3-4 per cent
in recent years (Andreano and McCollum, 1983; Gramlich, 1981). Others believe that the discount rate should reflect
the rate of inflation or rate of interest
that could be obtained from a high quality bond or other private sector investment, i.e., 7-10 per cent. In some costbenefit analyses several discount rates
are used and the choice of which is appropriate for a particular situation is left
to the policymakers who evaluate a particular program. In the present study,
discount rates of 4, 7, and 10 per cent
were calculated. Although tables and
narrative use the 7 per cent discount
rate, values associated with the other
discount rates are given in the footnotes
of the relevant tables.

An important issue concerning costs
and benefits of prevention programs is
that of reproductive “compensation” or
“replacement.” In the case of disorders
that are prevented by termination of
pregnancy, the projected lifetime costs
of an individual with a disorder such as
Down syndrome can be viewed to be affected by whether or not the affected fetus is “replaced” by an infant with normal genotype (Hook, 1979). Andreano
and McCollum (1983) concluded that
the replacement case was not a relevant
consideration when determining the net
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

190 Barden and Kessel

benefits of an amniocentesis program.
However, in calculations concerning
congenital hypothyroidism, the abnormal child is essentially “replaced” by a
normal one as a result of early detection
and successful treatment with thyroid
hormone. The question of whether the
child with congenital hypothyroidism
will be completely normal in a neuropsychological sense is not entirely clear.
Because the major abnormalities associated with congenital hypothyroidism,
including mental retardation, are generally avoided by early detection and
treatment, the present study will assume
normality. Therefore, in calculating
benefits (avoided costs) of hypothyroid
screening, the consumption costs
($4,000) of a normal individual were
subtracted from the costs of care of the
untreated individual with congenital hypothyroidism. In addition, the difference between the wage earnings of an
average normal individual and the expected earnings of an individual with untreated hypothyroidism (or with treatment delated until the appearance of
gross clinical signs) constitutes lost productivity and is included as a benefit
when the “replacement” situation applies (Hook, 1979).

PROGRAM COSTS

The costs of the program to prevent
the serious developmental abnormalities associated with congenital hypothyroidism include the cost of screening and
detection and the subsequent costs associated with the treatment of those detected. Screening and detection costs included the costs related to the collection
of the blood specimen and the costs incurred for laboratory testing. Treatment
costs for individuals with congenital hypothyroidism were modest and included
the costs associated with periodic clinic

Social Biology

visits, blood tests, and the minimal cost
(approximately $20.00/year) for thyroid
hormone replacement medication.

The cost of collecting the blood specimen in the hospital was estimated to be
$4.60. This cost included expenses for
drawing blood, administration costs,
medical record costs, supplies, billing
costs, and overhead. Because one collection procedure provided the blood
specimens for four screening tests, the
cost of the hypothyroid portion was
$1.15 ($4.60/4).

All samples collected in relation to
the Wisconsin Infant Health Screening
Program are sent to the Wisconsin State
Laboratory of Hygiene for analysis. The
State Laboratory tests blood samples for
congenital hypothyroidism, phenylketonuria (PKU), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) and galactosemia. The
laboratory costs for each of these four
test procedures were allocated according to the commitment of personnel
(FTE) and the cost of supplies associated with each test. The laboratory cost
of testing for hypothyroidism was estimated to be $3.45 per sample (Table 1).
This cost included personnel salaries,
supplies and expenses, administrative
costs, and general laboratory overhead.

When the initial tests for congenital
hypothyroidism are determined to be
positive, recall tests must be done to verify the initial finding. The recall rate in
Wisconsin was estimated to be approximately 2 per cent. The great majority of
recalls were ultimately determined to be
due to false positive results of the initial
tests. The cost of recall was estimated to
add $1.60 to the cost of each sample
tested (Table 10).

The sum of the costs for collecting
and testing, including recall tests, was
the cost for processing each sample.
This cost was estimated to be $6.20 for
the period July 1, 1981 through June 30,
1982. The cost for processing each sample was then multiplied by the incidence
of congenital hypothyroidism in Wisconsin (1:6,500) to arrive at the cost for
detecting each case. The discounted cost
of detecting each case of congenital hypothyroidism was $40,300 (Table 10).

Treatment costs of individuals with

BENEFITS

The benefits that result from the detection and successful treatment of an
individual with congenital hypothyroidism are represented by the total cost of
the disease if left untreated. In the case
of congenital hypothyroidism, early detection before clinical manifestations of
the disorder appear is essential to prevent the mental retardation that is commonly associated with this disorder. The
benefits (avoided costs) generally comprise three elements: (1) expenditures
related to the lifelong care of an individual with congenital hypothyroidism
whose disorder was not treated until ob

192 Barden and Kessel

vious clinical manifestations of the disorder appeared; (2) loss of productivity
resulting from premature death or disability; (3) the pain, suffering, emotional deprivation, and changes in the
quality of life for the affected individual
and those associated with him/her
(Sorkin, 1975). Although this latter cost
constitutes an important and potentially large proportion of the total
benefits (avoided costs), it is difficult to
express in monetary terms and is generally not included in cost-benefit analyses. However, the social value of avoiding the cost of pain and suffering
associated with a particular disorder
should not be forgotten when evaluating
any prevention program and should be
as important as estimated monetary
costs and benefits when evaluating a
particular program (Mamunes, 1976).

Benefits (avoided costs) which can
more easily be expressed in monetary
terms include: cost of institutional care,
cost of foster care, cost of special education, cost of adult care and services, cost
attributable to the lost productivity of an
affected individual, and costs associated
with a mother who foregoes an income
to care for an affected child.

The avoided costs of institutional and
residential care and services for an individual with congenital hypothyroidism
represent a large component of the
benefits associated with the hypothyroid
detection program. In order to estimate
these costs over the lifetime of the individual, one must take into account the
increased mortality that might be associated with a particular disorder. Because
most cases of congenital hypothyroidism would eventually be identified and
treated, any excess mortality was that
associated with institutional living for
those whose mental retardation resulted
in their being institutionalized. The

Social Biology

present report used the 95 per cent of
normal survival rate suggested previously (Layde et al., 1979).

The anticipated level of mental retardation of an individual with congenital
hypothyroidism who is not detected and
treated at an early age is an important
consideration when estimating avoided
costs based on the proportion of affected individuals who would require institutional care, foster care, adult care
and services, and special education. The
amount of lost productivity also varies
according to the projected level of mental retardation. For the present analysis
it was assumed that 15 per cent of individuals with undetected congenital hypothyroidism would be severely mentally retarded (IQ 35 and below), 25 per
cent would be moderately retarded (IQ
50-36), 20 per cent would be mildly retarded (IQ 69-51), and 20 per cent
would have suboptimum intelligence IQ
85-70). Twenty per cent would have
normal intelligence.

In 1982 the cost of institutional care
at the Wisconsin Centers for Developmental Disabilities was approximately
$36,500/year. From this figure, $4,000
was deducted to reflect the personal
consumption costs which would have
been incurred by the family if the child
were normal and not institutionalized
(Sorkin, 1975). Consumption costs were
estimated from figures presented for a
family of four and included the estimated costs for food, housing, clothing,
medical care, and other necessities (Statistical Abstracts of the United States,
1981). In the present analysis it was assumed that institutional care would not
begin until age 5. The estimated longterm cost of institutional care for one individual with congenital hypothyroidism, assuming institutionalization from
age 5 to 70, was approximately
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

Vol. 31, No. 3-4

$325,000 (Table 4). However, because
only 15 per cent of children with this disorder would be severely retarded and
require long-term institutional care, the
average cost of long-term institutional
care per Child with congenital hypothyroidism was estimated to be approximately $49,000 (Table 9).

The annual cost of foster care was estimated to be $5,000 ($9,000 less $4,000
personal consumption costs). The discounted cost of foster care was estimated to be approximately $32,000 for
the years from age 5 to 20 (Table 5). For
congenital hypothyroidism, the average
cost per child for foster care, assuming
that 25 per cent of affected children
would require foster care from age 5 to
20, was $8,110 (Table 9).

Annual costs of adult residential care
and services was estimated to be
$12,000. This figure is admittedly a
rough estimate. The average cost for
adult nursing home care in Wisconsin
ranged from $30-$85 per day, with com

“Undiscounted costs for foster care were $5,000 per year ($9,000 less $4,000 cost for personal consumption). Undiscounted
costs for adult residential care and services were $12,000 per year ($16,000 tess $4,000 cost for personal consumption). Undiscounted and discounted costs have been adjusted to take into account a rate of survival estimated to be 95 per cent of normal

homes for the mentally retarded were
determined to be in the $10,000-$20,000
range, not including costs associated
with community services such as special
transportation, vocational rehabilitation, and controlled workplaces. The
discounted cost of adult residential care
and services for an individual who would
require adult residential care and services from age 20-70 was estimated to be
approximately $41,000 (Table 5). Using
the assumption that 40 per cent of individuals with congenital hypothyroidism
would require these services, the average cost per affected individual was estimated to be $16,510 (Table 9).

The total benefits (avoided costs) related to institutional care, foster care,
and adult residential care and services
was estimated to be approximately
$73,000. This figure incorporated adjustments to survival rate, 7 per cent discount rate, and assumptions of need for
these services based on the expected incidence of mental retardation associated
with the absence of screening, early detection, and treatment of individuals
with congenital hypothyroidism.

The cost of special education is another benefit (avoided cost) of a program that detects and successfully treats
individuals with congenital hypothyroidism. Costs of special education represent costs in excess of the costs of providing a normal education. The added
costs of special education were determined for individuals with severe
(SMR), moderate (TMR), and mild
(EMR) levels of retardation, utilizing
figures from a nationwide study of costs
of special education (Kakalik et al.,
1981). The total added cost of special
education, utilizing estimated rates of
survival and a 7 per cent discount rate,
was approximately $43,000 for the severely mentally retarded, $38,000 for

the moderately retarded, and $22,000
for the mildly retarded (Table 6). Based
on the predicted levels of mental retardation used above, the average cost of
special education was determined to be
approximately $25,000 per affected
child (Table 9).

“Costs of special education were derived from Kakalik et
al. (1981). Undiscounted and discounted costs have been adjusted to take into account a rate of survival estimated to be 95
per cent of normal survival rates. Normal survival rates were
obtained from National Center for Health Statistics Monthly Vital Statistics Report (1982) 31, p. 18.

’ Discounted costs at the 4 per cent discount rate were
$57,100 for severely retarded, $50,720 for moderately retarded, and $29,600 for mildly retarded. Discounted costs at
the 10 per cent discount rate were $32,700 for severely retarded, $28,440 for moderately retarded. and $17,300 for
mildly retarded. All costs are added costs of special education.

Children with mental retardation
place special burdens on other members
of the family. Often a portion of the
family’s potential income is foregone in
order to care for the child with special
needs. This loss is referred to here as lost
maternal income. The present analysis
assumed that one-half of mothers who
would normaily be employed if their
child were normal would choose not to

Vol. 31, No. 3-4

become employed if their child were
mentally retarded (Andreano and McCollum, 1983). Studies have indicated
that 45 per cent of mothers were employed if their child of 0 to 6 years of age
was normal (Statistical Abstracts of the
United States, 1981). Following this assumption, we estimate that 22.5 percent
of mothers with a mentally retarded
child would forego employment for a
child in the 0-6 year bracket. Thirty-one
per cent (one-half of 62 per cent) would
forego earnings for a child aged 6-18
years and 23 per cent would forego earnings for a child aged 18-20 years.

The discounted lost maternal income
for mothers with a retarded child with
congenital hypothyroidism was approximately $31,000 (Table 7). This figure
takes into account the expected percentage of working mothers and the estimated survival rate of the affected child
(Table 7). When this figure was adjusted
to include only mothers whose child was
not institutionalized or in a foster home,
the average lost maternal income from 0
to 20 years was estimated to be $13,000
per affected child (Table 9).

Lost productivity represented a substantial portion of the avoided costs associated with the prevention of the mental retardation. The estimated value of
the lifetime productivity of workers was
derived from Conley (1973). Although
Conley used a lower rate of survival in
his calculations than has been used in
the present report, the effect on overall
productivity costs was relatively small.
Values for 1982 were determined by ap- —
plying annual per cent changes in wage
rates for the period 1971-81 (Statistical
Abstracts of the United States, 1981).
Lost lifetime productivity values were
determined by subtracting the lifetime
productivity estimates of the retarded
subject from productivity figures for the
general population (Table 8). Using the
estimate that 40 per cent of subjects
would be moderately or severely retarded and 20 per cent would be mildly
retarded, the average lost lifetime earnings per affected individual was estimated to be approximately $31,000 (Table 9).

“ The per cent employed figures were based on the assumption that one-half of the mothers who would work if their child were
normal, would not work if their child were mentally retarded. Figures of the percentage of mothers who work varied from 45 per
cent to 62 per cent, depending upon the age of the child ( Statistical Abstract of the United States (1981), p. 389).

* Undiscounted costs are total costs based upon an estimated annual income of $11,100 for working women ( Statistical Abstracts of the United States (1981), p. 739). Undiscounted costs and discounted costs have been adjusted to take into account a rate
of survival of the hypothyroid child estimated to be 95 per cent of normal survival rates and the estimated per cent of mothers

employed.

“Lifetime productivity figures were derived from Conley, (1973) and brought to 1982 levels by applying the annual per cent

changes in wage rates for the period 1971-81 ( Statistical Abstracts of the United States, 1981). Conley’s figures were based on the
following assumptions:

(a) Earnings of mildly retarded were comparable to the earnings of the general population to age 25, Thereafter, earnings
decline to 86% of normal for males and 87% of normal for females:

(b) Earnings of moderately retarded workers were 20° of normal,

(c) Employment rates for mildly retarded workers were the same as for the gencral population up to the age of 25. Thereafter
they were 4% below average for males and 12% below average for females:

(d) Employment rates among moderately retarded workers were 45% of normal for males and 12% of normal rates for
females;

(e) Mortality rates were 25% above normal for mildly retarded subjects and 75% above normal for moderately retarded
subjects:

(f) The value of unpaid work was 25% of gross carnings for men and 37.5“ of gross earnings for women. The unpaid productivity for women mainly represented homemaking services.

> Lost productivity for the 46% ($40,970) and 10% ($23,050) discount rates were estimates based on extrapolations from

7% discounted figures from Conley (1973).

© Lifetime productivity figures were additionally discounted at 7% rate for the years 1982-2000, the 18 years before pro
ductivity begins.

hypothyroidism detected through the
Wisconsin Infant Health Screening Program ts presented in Table 10. The total
cost for detection and treatment was
$43,530 per affected individual. The total benefit (avoided costs) was $141,770.
The net benefit (benefit — cost) of detecting and treating one individual with
congenital hypothyroidism was estimated to be $98,240. In Wisconsin 13 individuals with congenital hypothyroidism were detected in the 1981-82 testing
year (Table 2). Thus, the total net
benefit of this screening program for
congenital hypothyroidism in Wisconsin
was approximately $1,277,000. Relatively modest program costs were

greatly offset by the anticipated benefits
of avoiding the mental retardation commonly associated with this serious disorder.

for T, and TSH $60. , $20. clinic charge. and $10 travel expense. If the recall tests were done at the State Lab, the cost per test was
$7.00, The cost for the test, clinic visit, and travel would be $37.00. Approximately 20% of recall tests are tested at the State Lab,
The average cost for recall tests was thus approximately $80.00. If 2% of all samples are recalled, the cost of recall per sample was
