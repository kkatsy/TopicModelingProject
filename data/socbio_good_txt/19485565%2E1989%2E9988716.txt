Do Gravidity and Age Affect Pregnancy Outcome?

ABSTRACT: Fetal loss has generally been found to vary with gravidity, previous experience of
fetal loss, and maternal age, but the literature is divided on the reasons for these associations. In
this paper we examine pregnancy histories obtained retrospectively from a nationally representative one-in-one-thousand sample of women in Australia aged 20 to 59 years. The relations of
fetal loss ratios with both gravidity and previous outcome are consistent with heterogeneity of
risk over the study population and a stopping rule, whereby high-risk women undertake more
pregnancies than low-risk women to achieve the same number of live births. Evidence is presented that elevated Joss ratios in the teens indicate not higher risk but a selection for short
gestation intervals, while loss ratios beyond the mid-thirties do not point unequivocally to a
substantial increase in risk at the older reproductive ages.

Fetal death is defined as ‘“‘death prior
to the complete expulsion or extraction
from the mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of
pregnancy” (World Health Organization, 1970, pp. 5-6). Studies conducted
in the 1930’s and 1940’s suggested that
about 10 per cent of pregnancies ended
in spontaneous abortion (United Nations, 1954, pp. 14-16) but by 1970 the
World Health Organization was suggesting an upward revision to 15—20 per
cent (World Health Organization, 1970,
pp. 20-21). Intrauterine mortality accounted for between 12 and 15 per cent
of pregnancies in eleven out of the
twelve studies cited by Léridon (1977, p.
63). In actual fact, many early losses are
unrecognized, so that the true incidence
of fetal wastage is considerably higher;
for example, the most recent clinical estimates, while lower than some earlier
ones, suggest an incidence of unrecognized fetal Joss (after implantation) of a
little over one-fifth of all pregnancies,
and thus a true incidence of about onethird (Wilcox et al., 1988).

Most studies of pregnancy wastage
have been based on hospital or clinic records or on questionnaires administered
to obstetric or gynecological patients.
Such women are not representative of
the female population in general. ObSstetric patients, for example, can provide information only on losses followed
by a pregnancy which has survived for
one or two months, while gynecological
patients may suffer from conditions predisposing to spontaneous abortion
(United Nations, 1954, pp. 12-14). An
alternative, and statistically preferable,
method of data collection is to sample
women randomly rather than on the basis of hospital or clinic attendance, pregnancy, or confinement, or some other
behavior related to pregnancy outcome
(Warburton and Fraser, 1964, p. 1; Léridon, 1976, pp. 320-322). Recall itself
may be a problem, whatever the sampling strategy, and may become poorer
the longer the period over which anamnestic information is sought. Moreover,
women, if selected randomly, might be
less willing to discuss sensitive topics

such as abortion, particularly induced
abortion, in an interview from which no
health-related benefit can be expected
than they would in a clinic-based study
where such information can be viewed
as part of their medical history (World
Health Organization, 1970, pp. 12-14).

Retrospective surveys have indeed
not been uniformly successful in recording pregnancy wastage. The median
proportion of pregnancies terminating
in a nonlive birth in 39 developing countries which participated in the World
Fertility Survey was only 7 per cent.
Levels no higher than 5 per cent were recorded in one-quarter of the surveys,
while levels of at least 15 per cent were
recorded only in three, and then only

_ because they were inflated by induced

abortion (Chidambaram et al., 1980, p.
25; Casterline, 1988). Surveys have,
however, been more successful outside
the Third World. Spontaneous fetal loss
accounted for 13 per cent of the pregnancies of a sample of women doctors in
the United Kingdom (Roman, 1984, p.
30) and for 17 per cent and 13 per cent of
the pregnancies of two cohorts of
women in a prospective study initiated
in 1935 (Wilcox et al., 1981, p. 549).

The data on which this paper is based
come from a recent national singleround retrospective survey of women
conducted in Australia. We examine the
bases of the observed relationships of
pregnancy loss with gravidity and with
maternal age.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The Australian Family Project conducted a national sample survey of onein-one-thousand households in Australia in 1986-87, interviewing 2,547
women aged 20-59 years. A primary
aim of the Project was to examine the

 

 

Social Biology

recent declines in marriage and fertility
in Australia, and the heart of the questionnaire was a series of life histories relating to marriages and consensual unions, childbearing, use of contraception
and labor-force participation (Bracher,
1987).

The questionnaire was designed to
simulate, as far as possible, a structured
conversation. Great pains were taken,
therefore, to ensure a logical and natural sequence of questions. The section
on childbearing closed with questions
about plans for more children or, if appropriate, the reason why the respondent had stopped childbearing. A question on pregnancy wastage followed,
and led into a block of questions designed to discover any fecundity impairments and thus to throw light both on
childbearing and on contraceptive use,
and then into a complete contraceptive
history.

The question on fetal loss was designed to elicit the number and type of
pregnancy losses experienced by each
respondent and their timing relative to
first marriage and live births. The question was carefully worded so as not to
suggest that. we were probing for induced abortions, the legality of which is
recent in Australia relative to the reproductive lifetimes of many of the respondents and also differs between states. At
training sessions interviewers typically
asked whether the question was really
about induced abortions, and we were
at pains to stress that spontaneous losses
were actually more common. No respondent refused explicitly to answer
this question, nor was any loss reported
without an indication of the birth interval into which it fell.

Nearly 30 per cent of interviewed
women had experienced a fetal death.
Of the 6,213 pregnancies reported in the

Vol. 36, No. 1-2

study 1.1 per cent ended in stillbirth,
14.0 per cent in spontaneous abortion,
and 2.9 per cent in induced abortion.
The overall level of spontaneous fetal
death agrees extremely well with levels
from the best studies conducted elsewhere. The data on late fetal death are
also of the right order of magnitude although comparisons with official statistics are hampered by interstate differences in registration practice and
definition, and by the fact that pregnancies reported in the survey did not necessarily terminate in Australia. Nevertheless, women aged 50~59, for example,
whose pregnancies were centered
around the late 1950’s, reported a ratio
of 19 stillbirths to 1,000 live births plus
stillbirths, while published stillbirth ratios for Australia in the 1950’s and
1960’s range from 18 down to 12 (United
Nations, 1970). Similarly, a stillbirth ratio between 1981 and 1986 of 9 per 1,000
live births and stillbirths accords well
with published ratios of between six and
eight (Australian Bureau of Statistics,
1986).

In the following analyses we follow
the practice of Léridon (1976) and Roman (1984) in grouping all spontaneous
fetal deaths, since ‘‘stillbirth” and ‘“‘miscarriage” were distinguished in the
questionnaire simply to mirror acceptable colloquial usage. We deal with multiple births by defining parity as the
number of live confinements rather than
the number of live births. Ectopic pregnancies were explicitly distinguished
from other spontaneous or induced
losses in only 0.14 per cent of pregnancies although the expected proportion is
about 0.4 per cent (Llewellyn-Jones,
1982, p. 196; Pharaoh et al., 1977, p.
34). We thus make no attempt to exclude such pregnancies although other
studies have done so, where possible,

 

Gravidity and Age 11

because of their different etiology (Roman, 1984). They are in any case so rare
that their inclusion will not significantly
alter our findings.

The induced abortion data are the
hardest to assess. Abortion is now available virtually on demand in New South
Wales and Victoria, which contain
three-fifths of the country’s population,
but not in the other states (Yusuf and
Briggs, 1985). Official abortion statistics
are available only for South Australia,
and only since 1970, when legislation
was amended there. For the last ten
years or so that state has registered 17
induced abortions for 100 live births
(Hart and MacHarper, 1987, p. 200).
Our survey data suggest a national incidence of induced abortion over the last
decade of only one-third this level, although the age pattern resembles South
Australia’s in that the highest ratios, between three and four times the overall
ratio, pertain to the recent pregnancies
of teenagers and women over 40.

While it would be incorrect to extrapolate from South Australia to the country as a whole, it is likely that some induced abortions were probably not
reported. Yet this underreporting may
not be a serious problem. Our focus is
on spontaneous losses, and recent studies have been singularly unsuccessful in
demonstrating that the risk of spontaneous loss is elevated by a previous induced abortion (Chung et al., 1982; Hogue et al., 1982; Chung et al., 1983).

Even with perfect reporting, induced
abortion is a nuisance factor in a study of
spontaneous abortion because of competing risks. Some pregnancies that are
deliberately aborted would have miscarried anyway; and some pregnancies miscarry while induced abortion is being
contemplated. Thus, the higher the proportion of pregnancies ending in in

12 Santow and Bracher

duced abortion, the lower the proportion ending in spontaneous abortion: for
example, when 37 per cent of pregnancies in Hungary terminated in induced
abortion only 8 per cent terminated in
spontaneous abortion (Czeizel et al.,
1984). This competition must be taken
into account when assessing the true risk
of spontaneous abortion (Susser, 1983;
Olsen, 1984).

Some analyses of spontaneous fetal
death simply exclude women who report an induced abortion (Léridon,
1976; Roman, 1984). The logic of excluding earlier events on the basis of
later behavior is doubtful, particularly
when incomplete pregnancy histories
are not excluded from analysis. Other
analyses exclude just those pregnancies
that terminate in induced abortion
(Pharaoh et al., 1977; Wilcox et al.,
1981). This precludes analysis on the basis of earlier outcomes particularly in
light of the problem of competing risks.
In our study, for example, as many as 30
per cent of pregnancies occurring after
an induced abortion were terminated by
a second or higher-order abortion, and
thus as few as 5 per cent ended in spontaneous fetal death. A third approach,
and the one followed here, is to censor
pregnancy histories at the first induced
abortion. This approach retains preabortion data, excludes post-abortion
data, and retains unbroken pregnancy
histories for sequential analysis.

Some preparatory work was necessary to determine ages at fetal death.
Dates of fetal loss were not sought directly, although interviewers were instructed to note any date volunteered by
the respondent or any more general
comment related to the timing of a fetal
death. In the absence of such information each fetal loss could be located
within an interval defined by the earliest

Social Biology

and latest dates at which the loss could
have occurred, related, for example, to
previous or subsequent pregnancies,
Sterilization, or menopause.

The upper and lower limits of the
timing of 32 per cent of fetal losses lay
within the same five-year age group. An
examination of interviewers’ jottings established dates for a further 36 per cent
of losses, one-third being in the form of
month and year and two-thirds in the
form of year only. Dates of the remaining 32 per cent of fetal losses were then
randomly imputed over the possible interval. The age distributions of losses
with known dates and of losses with imputed dates did not differ significantly.

RESULTS
GRAVIDITY AND MATERNAL AGE

Many studies have demonstrated
that pregnancy loss ratios rise with gravidity. Of eleven studies cited by Léridon (1977, pp. 64-66), for example, the
study with the median loss ratio (15 per
cent) exhibited a loss ratio at the first
pregnancy of 13 per cent, and at preg
nancy orders 6+ of 19 per cent. In

these, and other studies, loss ratios
tended to rise markedly only at the third
or fourth pregnancy, rather than linearly (see also Roman, 1984, p. 30).

A more complex relation has been
observed between pregnancy loss ratios
and maternal age. While ratios tend to
rise with age, particularly from the midthirties, they are sometimes higher in
the teens than the twenties. For example, five of Léridon’s eleven studies exhibited higher loss ratios in the teens
than at ages 20-24, and four of these five
studies had higher loss ratios in the teens
than at ages 25-29 (Léridon, 1977, p.
63). One study showed a proportion of
pregnancies terminating in spontaneous

Vol. 36, No. 1-2

abortion before age 25 (24 per cent) so
high that it was exceeded only by the
proportion terminating at age 40 or
above (34 per cent) (Pharaoh et al.,
1977, p. 35).

Univariate tabulations are not completely informative, however, because
gravidity is correlated with maternal
age. Cross-classification by pregnancy
order typically exaggerates the J- or Ushaped pattern with age, or reveals such
a pattern at the higher orders. Danish
data cited by Nortman (1974, p. 24), for
example, show loss ratios falling from 10
per cent to 9 per cent between the teens
and early twenties. Comparable ratios
for the first and second pregnancies
were not differentiated by age, but for
the third pregnancy were respectively 16
and 8 per cent.

The proportion of pregnancies terminating spontaneously in fetal death in
the Australian Family Project is tabulated by pregnancy order and age at termination in Table 1. While the loss ratios exceed many of those cited above
they show similar patterns with age and
gravidity, namely, increases with pregnancy order both within age groups and
overall, and a J-shape with age which is
exaggerated at the higher pregnancy orders. We will deal with the gravidity and
age effects in turn.

Wuat CAUSES THE RELATION WITH
GRAVIDITY?

Increases in loss ratios within each
age group with pregnancy order once
encouraged the belief that individual
risk increased with each pregnancy
(Warburton and Fraser, 1964; Naylor,
1974; discussion in Kline, 1978). This
belief was challenged by James as long
ago as 1963, and more recent work has
indeed failed to find a direct association

at the individual level between the risk
of spontaneous loss and gravidity (Kline
et al., 1978).

A number of studies have shown that
the proportion of fetal deaths at each
gravidity increases with previous experience of fetal death (Warburton and Fraser, 1964; Léridon, 1977; Yudkin and
Baras, 1983; Strobino et al., 1986).
Table 2, which tabulates loss ratios by
sequences of outcomes, O representing
a live birth and X a fetal loss, indicates

that this pattern is observable also in our

data. It is immediately clear that risk
does not rise simply with gravidity since,
for example, the proportions of second
and third pregnancies terminating in the
first fetal loss (12 and 14 per cent) differ
little from the proportion of first pregnancies (13 per cent).

Two possible mechanisms have been
suggested for the increase in loss ratios
with previous experience, and either

Social Biology

would lead to an apparent relation with
gravidity. The first, the “recurrence
risk” hypothesis, postulates that a woman’s biological risk of another fetal
death increases not with each pregnancy, but with each fetal death. Kline
(1978, p. 340-342), using a simple
model in which the probability of fetal
death was constant with age and gravidity but rose from 0.15 to 0.24 after the
first fetal death, showed that the recurrences risk hypothesis implies a simple
rise in loss ratios with gravidity. Yet the
postulated etiology of this mechanism,
which is related to maternal responses to
fetal or maternal antigens, is obscure
(Wilcox and Gladen, 1982, p. 168). |
The second, and simpler, hypothesis
posits heterogeneous risk, according to
which women vary with respect to their
innate risk of pregnancy loss, and selective fertility, whereby subsequent childbearing is not independent of earlier

outcomes. It is suggestive, although not
conclusive, that Wilcox and Gladen
(1982) were able to simulate gravidity
effects as large as those observed in real
data using a model in which the occurrence of spontaneous abortion was determined primarily by heterogeneous
risk and selective fertility. Except in one
respect, to which we shall return later,
our data are in excellent agreement with
their simulation. In both, an overall gravidity effect disappears when attention
is restricted to pregnancies preceded
only by successful outcomes. Moreover,
in our data the proportion of pregnancies terminating in a loss of a particular
order tends to decline with gravidity: for
example, the proportion of pregnancies
terminating in a second fetal death falls
from 29 per cent at the second pregnancy to 21 per cent at the third. This is
compatible with the notion of heterogeneous risk since a greater number of previous live births indicates membership
of a subgroup with lower risk (just as a
higher number of previous losses indicates higher risk). In contrast, the
recurrence-risk hypothesis predicts that
order-specific loss ratios should remain
constant with increasing gravidity since
risk rises only with the experience of a
loss. Whatever the correct explanation,
previous experience of fetal death is
clearly a very strong predictor of pregnancy outcome and is therefore incorporated into all following analyses.

Wilcox and Gladen (1982) noted that
heterogeneity could not of itself produce an overall gravidity effect, but only
in combination with selective fertility.

They argued that high-risk women are

overrepresented at the higher gravidities since they must undertake more
pregnancies than low-risk women to
achieve the same number of living children. In effect, what changes from one

 

Gravidity and Age 15

pregnancy order to the next is not the
risk for individual women, but their distribution according to risk.

Our data show strong patterns of progression to the next pregnancy order on
the basis of the previous outcome.
There is little differentiation after the
first pregnancy because the one-child
family is relatively uncommon in Australia. Thus, 84 per cent of women with
a live birth and 87 per cent of women
with a fetal loss undertook a second
pregnancy. However, the picture is
quite different from the second pregnancy onward. Eighty per cent of
women who still had no live birth after
two pregnancies undertook a third pregnancy and 89 per cent of women who
had only one; but only 58 per cent of
women with two live births undertook a
third pregnancy. The pattern becomes
progressively more distinct at each successive pregnancy order, with continuation rates rising both with the number of
previous fetal losses and the more recent
the last fetal loss is in the sequence of
previous reproductive outcomes.

Low-risk women are thus progressively filtered out of the population as
gravidity increases because they achieve
their reproductive goals with fewer
pregnancies, on average, than high-risk
women. The disaggregation of the sample is neatly demonstrated in Table 3 in
which fetal loss ratios at given pregnancy orders, controlling for the number of previous losses, rise monotonically as the sample is progressively
restricted according to the minimum
gravidity attained. For example, after a
first successful pregnancy, those women
who conceived again lost, on average,
12.1 per cent of their second pregnancies; but women who subsequently progressed to a third pregnancy had lost
17.8 per cent of their second pregnan

cies, while women who ultimately undertook at least five pregnancies had lost
22.9 per cent of their second pregnancies. Moreover, the tendency for loss ratios of a particular order to decline with
gravidity is maintained within each subset of the sample defined by minimum
gravidity.

We move now to a formal test that
the Australian Family Project fetal loss
data are consistent with heterogeneous
risk and selective fertility. Following the
lead of Sheps and Menken (1973) and
Léridon (1977), we propose a model according to which the risk of fetal loss is
distributed over the population as a
Beta distribution. It is then possible to
derive an expression for the number of
women who have i losses in j pregnancies with a given sequence of pregnancy
outcomes, there being ,C; different sequences for these women (Léridon
1978). The expression is a function of i
and j and the parameters of the Beta distribution, a and b.

The model posits that at each gravidity the distribution of women according
to the sequence of live births and losses
is a function of the parameters a and b,
and the fitting procedure will therefore
be disturbed by the dependence of continuation rates on previous history and
immediate pregnancy outcome. To remove this dependence, we applied the
overall continuation rate observed between successive pravidities to the distribution of women according to their precise sequence of pregnancy outcomes.
Weighted numbers of losses and live
births at the next higher gravidity were
then derived by applying the observed
loss ratios to the weighted numbers of
women. Both the total number of
women at each gravidity and the loss ratios were therefore preserved, but the
distribution of outcomes at each gravidity was a function solely of the loss ratios
at that and each previous gravidity. The
weighted observed distributions were
fitted to the expected distributions over

a and b, using a minimum chi-squared
procedure.

Table 4 summarizes the characteristics of the best-fitting model, showing
weighted numbers at risk at each gravidity and by previous number of losses,
observed and predicted loss ratios, and
chi-squared test statistics at each gravidity and overall. The fit is excellent and
indicates that risk is distributed over the
study population with a mean of 0.144, a
variance of 0.0144, and a median of
0.11. Ten per cent of the sample have a
risk less than 0.02 and 10 per cent a risk
greater than 0.31.

The extreme skewness of the distribution is illustrated graphically in Figure
1. We show also the distribution of risk
amongst the subpopulations that undertook at least three pregnancies, and at

least four pregnancies.' Naturally, in
these two cases no adjustment for differential continuation rates was necessary.
With means risks of 0.183 and 0.217, respectively, the distributions demonstrate the increasing disaggregation of
the sample according to risk as gravidity
increases: 10 per cent of women who undertake at least three pregnancies have
an innate risk exceeding 0.35, but 10 per
cent of those who undertake at least four
have a risk exceeding 0.44.

The answer to the question posed at
the beginning of this section is thus
clear. Our data are consistent with the
notion of heterogeneous risk and selec

tive fertility, and not with that of recurrence risk. This finding does not mean
that individual risk never rises as a direct
result of complications associated with a
fetal loss, but rather that this cannot be
the major cause of the patterns observed
in loss ratios according to pregnancy order and previous reproductive history.

Is THE AGE EFFECT REAL?

We return now to the question of an
age effect. The overall J-shaped pattern
which was exaggerated at the higher
pregnancy orders in the younger age
groups in Table 1 is shown even more
clearly in the upper panel of Table 5,
which is conditioned also on previous
outcome. Even after a successful first
pregnancy the proportion of second
pregnancies ending in fetal death at ages
15-19 (27 per cent) is twice the corresponding proportion at ages 20-24 (13
per cent). This gradient appears after an
unsuccessful first pregnancy and persists

at the higher pregnancy orders. Moreover, the loss ratios at ages 15-19 (and
also at ages 20-24, but less markedly)
rise with gravidity among women with
no previous experience of fetal loss, although the hypothesis of heterogeneous
risk predicts that these ratios should fall
slightly.

The answer may lie with selection for
short confinement intervals at the young
ages. Consider two women who marry
at exactly age 19 years and who each
conceive exactly six months later. A successful outcome implies a birth after
turning 20, because the length of livebirth gestation is on average nine
months and rarely less than seven. On
the other hand, with an average gestation of three or four months, an unsuccessful outcome is more likely at age 19.

To gauge the strength of this effect,
we set up a microsimulation model of
pregnancy histories. The simulation incorporated age-dependent fecundabil

ity and sterility, and constant outcomedependent lengths of gestation and
short post-partum amenorrhoea with an
additional protected period after a live
birth selected randomly from a range of
zero to six months. Exposure to the risk
of conception was initiated randomly
between the ages of 17 and 27 years and
ended with sterility. Two models were
constructed, and in both the probability
of fetal death was independent of age
and gravidity.

The first model incorporated a constant risk of 0.14. The second incorporated heterogeneous risk as a Beta distribution with mean 0.14 and variance
0.014, and a stopping rule with women
producing families of between one and
six children with relative frequencies of

0.05, 0.45, 0.25, 0.15, 0.05, and 0.05.
One-hundred-thousand pregnancy histories were simulated in each computer
run to reduce stochastic variation in relatively uncommon cells.

The results of the simulations, shown
in the central and lower panels of Table
5 to facilitate comparison with the data,
strikingly illustrate that the effect of limited exposure on age at termination is
very strong indeed. Even though the
risk of fetal death was independent of
age in both simulations, the resulting
loss ratios decline with age within each
pregnancy order, controlling for the
number of previous losses, just as they
do in the data. Even the orders of magnitude are the same. For example, our
data show the probability of a first fetal

death at the second pregnancy falling
from 0.27 at ages 15-19 to 0.13 at ages
20-24, to 0.11 at ages 25-29, and to 0.09
at ages 30-34. The constant risk simulation produced comparable loss ratios of
0.30, 0.14, 0.14, and 0.09, and the heterogeneous risk simulation, 0.29, 0.14,
0.14, and 0.08.

It is thus unnecessary, or even inadvisable, to posit higher innate risk of fetal death at the youngest ages on the evidence of loss ratios alone. In her
influential literature review on the effect
of parental age on pregnancy outcome
and child survival, Nortman (1974) concluded that biology poses ‘“‘a persistent
U- or J-shaped irreducible minimum of
reproductive risk with respect to age”’
(p. 4) and that ages of childbearing
should therefore be voluntarily restricted. Our findings challenge this
statement, at least in the case of fetal
death, since pregnant teenagers are not
at demonstrably greater risk of fetal loss
than women in their twenties with the
same previous sequences of reproductive outcomes. Since the artifact is produced by limited exposure, loss ratios
will tend to be spuriously elevated in the
age group in which women are first exposed to the risk of conception if many
women are exposed for only a short time
within that age group.

However studies may disagree about
teenage risk, they concur in finding an
increase in the risk of fetal death for
pregnant women from the mid-thirties
on. The loss ratios in the Family Project
data likewise tend to jump between ages
30-34 and 35-49, although this is not
the case for every gravidity and experience group. The problem is that the effect of limited exposure at the youngest
ages has an obverse side at the oldest
ages, namely, that terminations at the
oldest ages are more likely to be associated with longer confinement intervals

and are thus less likely to be fetal deaths.
Given that this effect dampens any real
age-related rise in risk, the observed increases in the loss ratios are impressive
and undoubtedly reflect a real effect of
maternal age at least from age 35.
Whether risk actually begins to rise in
the early thirties is impossible to judge.

We mentioned earlier that the pattern of loss ratios simulated by Wilcox
and Gladen (1982) differed from our
own in one respect, in that our orderspecific loss ratios tend to decline with
gravidity, whereas theirs tended to remain constant. For example, in one of
their simulations, the proportions of
second, third, and fourth pregnancies
ending in a second fetal death were 27,
26, and 26 per cent respectively; in the
other, the proportions actually rose,
from 19 to 21 and to 23 per cent (Wilcox
and Gladen, 1982, p. 169). Comparable
observed proportions as presented in
the final column of Table 3, are 29, 21,
and 21 per cent and 18 per cent at the
fifth pregnancy. The declining pattern is
consistent with heterogeneous risk and,
indeed, is demonstrated also in our own
simulation (lowest panel of Table 5), in
our predicted loss ratios (Table 4), and
in other data (Wilcox and Gladen, 1982,
p. 169).

The cause of this disparity seems to
be Wilcox and Gladen’s explicit quantification of an effect of maternal age. A
woman assigned the mean risk of 0.11 at
age 20, for example, had a risk of 0.15 at
age 30 and 0.33 at age 40. Since age increases with gravidity, this increase apparently offsets the expected declines in
simulated order-specific loss ratios.

Yet, with no allowance for a maternal age effect, our predicted loss ratios
sit very close to the observed values.
Moreover, similar loss ratios were predicted when reproductive histories were
censored at age 30. Admittedly, only

one-fifth of Family Project pregnancies
terminated at age 30 or older. Even so,
were risk to rise as strongly with maternal age as Wilcox and Gladen believed,
we might have expected a poorer fit in
Table 4; the excellence of the fit suggests
that their age effect is exaggerated.

The question of an age effect is thus
not simply answered. Further evidence
than elevated loss ratios is necessary to
show an excess risk in the teens. At the
other end of the reproductive age range,
our data are consistent with increased
risk from the mid-thirties onward, but
without supporting evidence from other
studies would be inconclusive. Thus,
our results suggest that the strength of
this age effect may well have been overestimated in the past.

CONCLUSION

Analyses of pregnancy wastage routinely include tabulations by gravidity
and maternal age. Variations in fetal
loss ratios are frequently interpreted as
reflecting changing risk at the individual
level, which leads to either implicit or
explicit support for the notion of recurrence risk. Moreover, an analysis that
simply reports observed relations with

 

 

Gravidity and Age 21

gravidity and age is uninformative because it does not attempt to address the
underlying causes of the observed relationships.

Our findings demonstrate that recurrence risk cannot be the primary determinant of observed patterns of loss ratios according to gravidity and previous
obstetric history. Rather, they indicate
that observed patterns according to gravidity and previous outcome are not
substantively interesting in themselves,
but reflect the operation of a fertilitystopping rule in conjunction with a
highly skewed distribution of innate risk
of loss. Our findings indicate also that
this innate risk is invariant with age at
least until the mid-thirties and may not
even rise particularly sharply beyond
that point.
