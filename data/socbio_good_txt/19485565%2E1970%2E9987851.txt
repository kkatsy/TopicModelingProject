Abortions, Chromosomal Aberrations,

and Radiation

It is well known that an appreciable proportion of recognized pregnancies end in socalled “spontaneous” or “unintentional”
abortions. Actual estimates range from 4 to
20% (Freire-Maia, Guaraciaba, and QuelceSalgado, 1964; Warburton and Fraser,
1959), but tend to cluster between 8 and
12% (United Nations, 1954). It seems reasonable to assume that the most probable
frequency of recognized abortions in general
populations lies roughly around 10%, the
extremes of the above-mentioned range
being mostly due to variables connected
with the sources of data, the gestational
period at which a woman is recognized pregnant, and the methodology of collecting information. In our investigations, for instance, it is impressive that among both
whites and Negroes and high and low socioeconomic levels frequencies of abortions
have been found at the approximate level of
10% (Freire-Maia, Freire-Maia, and QuelceSalgado, 1963; Freire-Maia, 19634, FreireMaia and Krieger, 1963; Marcallo, FreireMaia, Azevedo, and Simées, 1964). Since a
certain proportion of embryonic deaths
which occur at a very early stage escape observation, it is safe to assume that the “‘total” prevalence of spontaneous abortions is

 

somewhat larger than 10%, say around 25%
or higher (Tietze, 1953).

Prospective investigations—at least as
commonly performed—cannot be expected
to give much better estimates than retrospective ones in this area. Since the first
weeks of pregnancy still remain out of observation and the gestational age at beginning of observation varies according to a
number of variables (education, economic
level, race, number and outcome of previous
pregnancies, etc.) comparisons between
groups classified on the basis of these criteria
remain difficult, and estimates of total pregnancy wastage may still be far below real
rates (on the difficulties confronted in
prospective investigations of fetal deaths,
see, for instance, Taylor [in press]}).

ABORTIONS AND CHROMOSOME ABERRATIONS

Etiological factors involved in spontaneous abortions are largely unknown; but the
little we know permits saying that they form
an extensive, complex, and heterogeneous
array, including antigenic incompatibility,
lethal genes, endocrine disorders, gynecologica} disturbances, accidents, and psychological traumas,

In recent years, a number of investigators

102

Vol. 17, No. 2

reported data on the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in spontaneous abortions.
These data, comprising 21 samples with
rather different sizes (from 7 to 200), reveal
somewhat conflicting results: from 2% (in a
sample of 50) to 64% (in a sample of 25); the
largest sample (200) led to a frequency of
22%. The average of 21 samples was 19%
(United Nations, 1966). A more recent investigation on 372 spontaneous abortions
led to a frequency of 47% (Boué, 1969), In
spite of these somewhat baffling results, it is
now safe to admit that chromosomal aberrations are an important cause of spontaneous
abortions, since among 458 induced abortions only 2% showing chromosomal aberrations have been reported (United Nations,
1966). An investigation on 700 induced
abortions confirmed these results: 1.5% by
culture and 2.8% by the direct method
(Nishimura, 1969).

The question naturally arises whether the
different frequencies verified by different authorities are real or whether they simply
result from pure sampling accidents and/or
technological variables. The above-mentioned frequencies may still be underestimates, since they do not include minor aberrations, such as minute deletions, that escape observation with current microscope
techniques.

CHROMOSOME ABERRATIONS
AND RADIATION

The first data on radiation-induced chromosomal breaks in human cells were based
only on in vitro irradiations, They led to estimates of doubling doses of 3.3 r (Bender,
1957), 6 r (Dubinin, Arsenieva, and Kerkis,
1960), or much higher (Bédk, Fraccaro,
Fredga, and Lindston, 1962). Investigations
based both on in vitro and in vivo exposures
(Bender and Gooch, 1962) showed that
spontaneous aberrations (whose data are
used as base line for comparisons) occur at
higher frequencies in vitro than in vivo, the
induced rates being approximately the same

both in vivo and in vitro. The first estimates
of doubling doses, based on data obtained
only from in vitro observations, are therefore inflated. On the basis of new data,
Bender and Gooch (1962) calculated the
dose required to double the spontaneous
rate of somatic chromosomal breakage as
0.87 r; they admit, however, that “even this
estimate may be too high” (p. 530).

RADIATION AND ABORTIONS

On the basis of the above considerations,
it seems that abortions should be a very sensitive indicator for studies on genetic effects
of radiation in man, With such an indicator,
we would measure, naturally, the joint action of both gene- and chromosome-induced
mutations. For gene mutations, estimates of
doubling dose are generally between 25 and
100 r, say roughly around 50 r (for a review,
see Bellefeuille, 1961; see also Frota-Pessoa
and Saldanha, 1960). According to Kato,
Schull, and Neel (1966), it is unlikely that it
lies below 50 r, probably being of the order
of 100 r, ‘‘for radiation of the type emitted
by an atomic bomb and for mutations of the
type resulting in early death in the first
post-bomb generation.”

As regards chronic and fractionated irradiation of spermatogonia and odcytes, which
seems to be the most important type of irradiation to which man is subjected, the
doubling dose may well be larger than 100 r.
Thus, it seems that, as measured by the consequence of genetic effects of radiation exposure on the production of embryonic
deaths, chromosome aberrations could be at
least 50 to 100 times more important than
gene mutations.

Unfortunately, as far as we know, besides
our preliminary information (Freire-Maia,
1963); Freire-Maia, Freire-Maia, and
Quelce-Salgado, 1965; Freire-Maia, 1968),
only one report has so far been published
with frequencies of abortions in an “‘irradiated” and in a control group, on the basis of
data on pregnancies, the difference between

them being nonsignificant (Cox, 1964).
Some investigations pooled abortions and
stillbirths (Macht and Lawrence, 1955;
Crow, 1955; Tanaka and Ohkura, 1958;
Kitabatake, 1960, 1962). Only one of them is
suggestive of a radiation-induced genetic
damage (Tanaka and Ohkura, 1958). It is
interesting to observe that one series of data,
based on a relatively small number of observations (Kitabatake, 1960, 1962), is presented not on the basis of recognized preg

regards abortions plus stillbirths plus postnatal mortality (17.14% against 10.61%;
x? = 5.31; P < 0,025). No clear and consistent conclusion can therefore be drawn
from the whole of these investigations.

Our own data were obtained among Brazilian physicians, some of whom worked
with ionizing radiation (“irradiated group”)
and others of whom were not professionally
connected with it (control). The control
data are based on 1,449 pregnancies and the

Although the frequencies of abortions
(10.35% against 6.75%), stillbirths (1.99%
against 1.03%) and mortality from birth up
to the age of 5 years (5.69% against 3.14%)
are consistently higher in the exposed group,

led to the results shown in Figure 1. They
show that the well-known positive parity
effect on abortions is stronger in the irradiated sample. Since the accumulated doses
increase with time, this is exactly what
would be expected according to the radiogenetics theory. The values of ¢ for the six

comparisons referred to in Figure 1 are the
following from pregnancy 1 to 6+ (sixth
plus the subsequent pregnancies): 0.25, 0.20,
0.05, 1.27, 1.99, and 1.90, respectively. Only
the fifth (1.99) is significant in a two-tailed
distribution (P < 0.05), but the last (1.90)
is also significant in a one-tailed distribution. Assuming a linear regression between
abortions and pregnancy order, the value of
b, the regression coefficient, has been found
to be 0.0239 in the irradiated group and
0.0084 in the control, the former being about
three times larger than the latter. The difference between them is highly significant
(t = 3.78).

Our total data, when analyzed under
other criteria (sex ratio, morbidity, degree
of protection, etc.), do not show a complete
consistency with the above findings. However, on the basis of what is known of the
importance of chromosome aberrations in
the production of abortions as well as of the
low doubling dose for chromosome breakage,
and since abortions are probably the most
sensitive indicator of radiation-induced genetic damage in man, we believe that the
results presented in Figure 1 may well reflect
a radiation effect. It also seems to be of interest to mention that the totals including
abortions (i.e., “total mortality,” which includes abortions, stillbirths, and mortality
from birth up to and including the age of 20,
and “grand total,” that includes “total mor

tality” and morbidity) also show a regression coefficient with pregnancy order significantly larger in the exposed group than in
the control one.

SUMMARY

This short review focuses on four main
points: (1) frequencies of abortions in general populations; (2) frequencies of chromosomal aberrations in spontaneous abortions;
(3) estimates of doubling doses in the production of chromosome breakage; and (4)
frequencies of abortions in human groups
exposed to artificial sources of ionizing radiation as compared with those from nonexposed groups. Due to the low doubling
dose for chromosome breakage and the substantial contribution of chromosomal aberrations to the occurrence of abortions, abortions would be expected to be a very sensitive indicator of radiation-induced genetic
damage in man. The reviewed investigations
do not show a complete agreement, but
some of them clearly suggest the presence of
a radiation effect.
