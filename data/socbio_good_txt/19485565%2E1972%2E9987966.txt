Are Physicians Sympathetic to Superstition?

A Study of Hinoe-Uma
Kanae Kaku

Regional Medical Program of Hawaii
Honolulu, Hawaii

Hinoe-Uma, or “Elder-fire-horse,” is the
name of a year in the ancient Japanese
calendar which characterizes each year by
earthly and zodiacal signs with each named
year recurring in a sixty-year cycle. In
Japanese mythology, the horse is symbolic
of the midday and of the south, thereby
suggesting brightness, heat, and strength.
In the year name, it is combined with the
consuming element of fire, which races like
a swift red horse across the land. This
ancient symbolization of the year HinoeUma has become intertwined with the tale
of the tragic death of a young Japanese girl,
Yaoya-Oschichi, in 1682. After fire had
destroyed her home, she took refuge in a
temple where she fell in love with a young
page. He was not allowed to leave the
temple so that Yaoya-Oshichi could not see
him again once she had a new home. In
desperation, she set fire to the house so that
she could return to the temple. Arrested and
found guilty of this crime, she was condemned to die by fire. Since she had been
born in the year of Hinoe-Uma, there de
 

 

veloped the superstition that it was a bad
omen for a girl to be born in this year.

During the most recent year in which
Hinoe-Uma fell, 1966, the total number of
live births in Japan was 1,361,000, representing a decrease of 462,000 in number
or 25.3% from the preceding year. This
total is unusually small, and even smaller
than 1906, the previous year of Hinoe-Uma.
Nonetheless, the number of births in 1906
was the lowest in the twentieth century
until 1966. The 1966 decrease in total live
births compared to the trend of preceding
years was a significant reduction, and the
number returned to normal after this year.
This decreased fertility may be attributed
to the superstition of Hinoe-Uma. One
imagines that parents are apprehensive of
having a daughter and therefore avoid pregnancies in 1966. This paper intends to
study the specific effects of superstition on
births in Japan around 1966.

The materials of this study are mostly
derived from Vital Statistics of Japan from
1961 to 1967 published by the Japanese

were about 10,000 more girls than expected
for December, 1965, and January, 1967.
For January and December of 1966, 9,100
fewer girls than expected were reported
(Table 4). Therefore, almost all artifacts
occurred specifically at the beginning and
end of the year of superstition to the adjacent months of preceding and following
years.

It appears that there was an intentional
misregistration of female births away from
1966 to the adjacent “safe” years (1965 and
1967) which accounts for the significant
fluctuations in the sex ratio for all three
years.

In Japan, the change of date of births
was a common practice. A child born at
the end of a year was commonly registered
as born early the next year. This was because age was counted by the year, so that
a person born on December 31 became two
years old the next day. This was considered
especially unfavorable for girls. Another
custom was to postpone the date of birth to

April 2 or after, so that a child could start
school one year later and begin life advantageously according to the belief of the
people.

The previous year of Hinoe-Uma was
1906 in which the number of births was
1,394,000, a decrease of 50,000 or 4% from
the preceding year. It was 169,000 or 10.8%
less than 1,563,000 estimated on the 1907—
11 regression trend. The year 1906 was
the time of demobilization from the RussoJapanese War; yet, the decrease of births,
instead of a baby-boom, was particularly
conspicuous for females and the male sex
proportion soared to 0.5208, a figure not
seen either before or after that year. The
usual male sex proportion had been 0.5120,
so in 1906 there was an unusual proportional decrease in female births. In an attempt to avoid the year of Hinoe-Uma,
some superstitious parents apparently registered the daughters born in 1906 as births
in the adjacent years.

In 1906, parents did not need to have
medical proof of births. However, in 1966,

the physician’s or midwife’s birth certificate
was required. Consequently, the change of
date of birth needed professional cooperation. The cooperation was a rather easy procedure. A doctor or a midwife who attended
a birth of a girl in 1966 could just happen to
forget to fill in the date of birth on the page
of certification in the maternity handbook
issued by the government to every expectant mother, who is required to present
this handbook on her regular obstetric
checkups and for well-baby care later.

SUMMARY

The Japanese superstition about the year
of Hinoe-Uma or Elder-fire-horse is that it
is an unfavorable omen for girls to be born
in that year. In 1966, the year of HinoeUma, live births in Japan decreased by
more than 25% (462,000) from the expected regression trend. This decrease was
largely the result of family planning.

About 11,000 girls were registered in excess of the expected number in 1965 or
1967. This caused very significant statistical changes of the sex ratio for these three
years, being 0.5129 in 1965, 0.5184 in
1966, and 0.5129 in 1967. The normal
ratio based on live births for the preceding years would have been 0.5143.

It has been observed that the annual

Social Biology

changes in the sex ratio were caused by
changes which occurred in January and
December, 1966, and the adjacent months
of December, 1965, and January, 1967.

This phenomenon resulted from an intentional misregistration of female births
away from the year of superstition. Since a
physician’s or midwife’s birth certificate is
required for registration, some physicians
and midwives attending births of a girl in
1966 arbitrarily forgot to fill in the date
of birth on the certificate. Thus, superstitious parents could avoid registering their
daughters in 1966.

The same phenomenon happened sixty
years ago in 1906. Will it happen again in
2026, the next year of Hinoe-Uma, or will
the superstition have disappeared by the
twenty-first century?
