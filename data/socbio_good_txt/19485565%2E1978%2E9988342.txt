An Ecological Analysis of Urban
Therapeutic Abortion Rates

ABSTRACT: An exploratory ecological investigation of abortion was done in Winnipeg, Manitoba,
Canada, using 1971 data. Abortion patients (376) were located by census tract (104), and rates
computed per thousand females aged 15-45 years. Pearsonian correlation coefficients were
computed for the dependent variable and thirteen other demographic and sociocultural variables.
Significant associations (at the 0.01 level) were found between abortion rates and five variables.
Positive associations were found with the sex ratio, the proportion of females never married, and
the proportion of one person households, and negative associations with the proportion of single
family households and income level. Results being different from those of clinical studies,
statistical analyses of official abortion reports, a national patient survey, and studies of background factors involved in favorable attitudes to abortion, the study suggests that the characteristics of social areas as well as of persons involved should enter into explanations of behavior as

complexly motivated as therapeutic abortion.

Since 1970, the first full calendar year
after the Criminal Code Amendments on
Abortion came into effect in Canada, the
number of abortions performed legally in
“accredited hospitals” with a therapeutic
abortion committee has continued to increase. The rate of increase of reported
induced abortions was greatest between
1970 and 1971 when there was a change of
177.3 per cent (Canada, Minister of Supply and Services, 1977). In succeeding
years there was a sharp curtailment in the
pace of annual growth, which was 11.4
per cent between 1973 and 1974. Therapeutic abortions since 1969 have undoubtedly been obtained in large part for psychological, social, and socioeconomic reasons rather than on strictly. medical
grounds. For the most part, therapeutic
abortion represents unwanted pregnancy.

Numerous attempts have been made to
characterize the women who have abortions in Canadian hospitals. Earlier in the
decade there were clinical studies based on

records of patients who received legal
abortions at selected hospitals (Boyce and
Osborn, 1970; Berston et al., 1972; Saunders, 1971). Additional sources of information are the annua) reports on therapeutic abortions (Canada, Statistics
Canada, 1972 ff.) which describe the
background of women who have undergone therapeutic abortions in Canadian
hospitals. More recently, the national patient survey conducted by The Committee
on the Operation of the Abortion Law
(Canada, Minister of Supply and Services,
1977) obtained information about women
having abortions. The women in the patient survey represented a cross-section of
patients who obtained abortions in 1976.

From the different sources of information about women who have abortions in
Canadian hospitals, several generalities
emerge. These women have a higher level
of education; fewer are Catholic women
and there is an overrepresentation of
members of other religious groups; higher

rates are found as the number of pregnancles increases; there appears to be failure
of women involved in abortion to have
used contraceptive precautions or to use
them correctly (but not due to ignorance or
lack of exposure to such information); and,
as a recent trend, higher rates are found
among younger ages and unmarried.

To my knowledge, no ecological study
of the factors associated with abortion has
been reported (see appendix of References,
Canada, Minister of Supply and Services,
1977; Adams, 1973). This paper reports an
investigation to determine whether abortion rates are related to the social characteristics of areas of the city as well as being
more prevalent among patients with the
characteristics cited above. The study is
exploratory in nature, attempting to utilize
a method which has been productive in
providing explanations for a wide variety
of social phenomena, including mental illness (Faris and Dunham, 1939; Redick
and Goldsmith, 1972), crime and delinquency (Cressey, 1960), mortality (Quinney, 1964; Schwirian and Lagreca, 1971),
and morbidity (Mabry, 1958; Pollack
et al., 1968).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The procedure used was (1) to determine the distribution of abortion rates for
1971, by census tracts, in the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, and (2) to relate the
abortion rates to selected social and demographic characteristics of the 104 census tracts in the metropolitan area. Aside
from the fact that the investigator was
located in Winnipeg, the city had several
advantages. It is sufficiently large and heterogeneous to provide a sizeable number
of units (census tracts) to use in the statistical analysis; almost all abortions in 1971
were performed in one hospital which
meant that one set of records could be
used; and the Records Department of the

Nett

hospital was willing to make the records
available to the investigator for the purpose of obtaining the permanent addresses
of patients who had had a therapeutic
abortion. The year 1971, the second year
following the change of law, was chosen
because it was the first year since 1966 for
which census information was available.!

Addresses of the 376 Winnipeg patients
who had had an abortion in 1971 were
taken from the records.* Each abortion
performed was then plotted on a map of
the city, by census tract, and the rates for
each of the 104 census tracts were computed in the following manner:

Abortion rate
_ total number of abortions, 1971
total females, ages 15—45 years
x 1,000.

The average rate for the 104 census
tracts was 3.4 abortions, with a standard
deviation of 2.6. The map in Figure 1
shows the distribution by census tract.

The seventeen census tracts with rates
of 6.0 or more abortions per 1,000 females
at risk were Tracts 3, 7, 8, 13, 15, 20, 24,
35, 43, 45, 46, 47, 113, 132, 532, 541, and
553. All but the last five are located in the
inner city. Family Planning Clinics with
abortion counseling were located in Tracts
15, 25, 27, 35, and 46, as indicated on the
map.

Rates of over 9.0 abortions per 1,000
females at risk (two standard deviations
away from the statistical mean) were
found in five census tracts, Nos. 13, 24,
46, 113, and 532.3

1 In retrospect a better method may have been to
compute averages for 1970, 1971, and 1972 abortions, births, and illegitimate births for each census
tract, thus eliminating chance fluctuations that occur
in any given year.

2 Excluded from the study were patients who gave
addresses that were (1) out of province or out of the
country, (2) in Manitoba towns and cities other than
Winnipeg, and (3) rural route numbers which could
not be located on the map of Winnipeg.

which Family Planning Clinics were located raises a

The lowest rates, 1.0 or less per 1,000
women at risk, were found in Tracts 31,
33, 36, 40, 41, 51, 103, 111, 112, 120, 502,
§10, 531, 538, 539, 540. All except the first
six are located outside the inner city, or in
the suburbs.

In addition to abortion rates, thirteen
other demographic and sociocultural variables were selected for the study. The

clinics on the abortion rate in the same and neighboring census tracts. In future investigations, distance
from counseling facilities might be included as an
independent variable.

General Fertility Rate (total number of

by the total number of unmarried women
15~44 years, times 1,000) were computed
for each of the 49 statistical districts in
Winnipeg for which information was
available from the Winnipeg Health Department. From the Census Tract Bulletins for Winnipeg (Canada, Minister of
Industry, Trade, and Commerce, 1973,

1974) information was obtained from
which the following measures were computed for each of the 104 census tracts:
Child/Woman Ratio (children under six
years, divided by total number of women
in the childbearing years, times 1,000); Sex
Ratio (total males 15—44 years, divided by
females 15-44 years, times 1,000); Proportion of Never-married Females (in the
childbearing years); Proportion of One
Person Households; Proportion of Single
Family Households; Proportion of
Catholics; Proportion of Foreign-born (after 1945); Ratio of Migrants/Nonmigrants;
Education Ratio (university-educated divided by Grade 8 and under); Income
Level (average total income per household); and Female labor Force Participation Rate (females 15 years and over in the
labor force, divided by total females 15
years and over, times 1,000).

With the abortion rate as the dependent
variable and the thirteen demographic and
sociocultural measures as independent
variables, Pearsonian correlation coefficients were computed. The level of
0.01 was accepted for tests of significance.

RESULTS

The matrix of Pearsonian correlations,
along with an indication of significant
values, is presented in Table 1. Five of the
thirteen census tract characteristics were
significantly associated with Abortion
Rates (AR) for the areas. They were as
follows: Sex Ratio (SR); Proportion Females Never Married (FNM); Proportion
One Person Households (OPH); Proportion of Single Family Households (SFH),
negatively; and Income Level (IL), negatively.

VARIABLES

significantly correlated with Abortion
Rates, the two indicators of household,
One Person Households (OPH) and Single
Family Households (SFH), correlated
significantly with nine of the variables; Income Level (IL), with seven; Females
Never Married (FNM), with six; and Sex
Ratio (SR), with three.

Detailed examination of these intercorrelations reveals certain patterns. One
Person Households (OPH) is associated
with Females Never Married (FNM), Ilegitimacy Rate (IR), General Fertility
Rate (GFR), Proportion Catholic (C), Proportion Foreign-born (F-B), Female Labor
Force Participation Rate (FLFP); and
negatively with Child/Woman Ratio (C/
WR), Single Family Households (SFR),
and Income Level (IL). Single Family
Households (SFH) is correlated negatively
with Females Never Married (FNM), Illegitimacy Rate (IR), General Fertility
Rate (GFR), One Person Households
(OPH), Proportion Catholic (C), Proportion Foreign-born (F-B), Female Labor
Force Participation Rate (FLFP); and
positively with Child/Woman Ratio
(C/WR) and Income Level (IL).

Income Level (IL) is correlated negatively with Illegitimacy Rate (IR), General
Fertility Rate (GFR), One Person Households (OPH), Education Ratio (ER), Proportion Catholic (C), and Proportion
Foreign-born (F-B); it correlates positively
with Single Family Households (SFH).

Proportion of Females Never Married
(FNM) correlates with the following six
variables: negatively with Sex Ratio (SR),
Child/Woman Ratio (C/WR), and Single
Family Households (SFH); and positively
with One Person Households (OPH),
Migrant/Nonmigrant Ratio (M/NM), and
Female Labor Force Participation Rate
(FLFP). Some of the highest r’s occur in
association with this variable.

And finally, Sex Ratio (SR) correlates
with Females Never Married (FNM),

negatively, and with Illegitimacy Rate
(IR) and Child/Woman Ratio (C/WR).

INDEPENDENT VARIABLES NOT
SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED
TO ABORTION

Some of the variables not associated
with abortion rates were correlated significantly with the other independent
variables as can be noted above. Among
them are Illegitimacy Rate (with ten variables), Child/Woman Ratio (with eight),
General Fertility Rate (with seven); and
Education Ratio (with seven). Lower
numbers of associated variables exist for
Proportion Catholic (six), Proportion
Foreign-born (the same six as for C), Female Labor Force Participation Rate (six),
and Migrant/Nonmigrant Ratio (two).

DISCUSSION

Abortions in Winnipeg in 1971 were not
randomly distributed throughout the city;
they occurred more frequently to women
in areas of the city with certain social
characteristics. High rates of abortion
were generally found in the census tracts
of the inner city. A few abortions were
performed on women located in the suburbs, which for the most part had the lowest rates. The highest rates of all were
found in the notorious “Main Street” and
adjacent area, with its bars, cheap hotels,
and public housing project. Census tract
characteristics associated with abortion
are (1) a high proportion of persons residing alone, (2) a low proportion of single
family dwellings, (3) low average household income, (4) more men than women in
the childbearing ages, and (5) a high proportion of women in the childbearing ages
who had never married.

Although abortion does not appear to be
significantly associated with illegitimacy,
a low birth rate, or a high ratio of children
under six years to women in the childbearing years, these fertility factors are in turn

240

associated with both one person and multiple family households, as well as with a
low level of income. Two of them, illegitimacy and a high child-woman ratio,
are associated with a sex ratio imbalanced
in favor of males. The birth rate (GFR)
accounts for 64 per cent of the variance in
illegitimacy (ry = 0.80). Additionally, female labor force participation, although
not itself a factor in abortion, tends to be
higher in census tracts with some of the
characteristics associated with abortion,
notably other types of housing than single
family residence and a high proportion of
single females. Also found in those census
tracts where housing and income are poor
(two factors associated with abortion) are
high proportions both of foreign-born and
Catholics, two variables themselves not
significantly related to each other, but
similarly associated with the remaining
variables.

One of the most interesting aspects of
this investigation is that the results of
ecological analysis are quite dissimilar
from the findings of studies on the characteristics of abortion patients (Boyce and
Osborn, 1970; Berston et al., 1972; Saunders, 1971; Canada, Statistics Canada,
1972ff; Canada, Minister of Supply and
Services, 1977). They are also dissimilar
from the findings of investigations which
have described populations in terms of
their attitudes toward abortion.*

The fact that the several approaches to
abortion reveal different associated factors
does not mean that one is “correct” and the
others “incorrent.” On the contrary, it
would seem to indicate that to understand
so multifaceted an issue as abortion many
perspectives are required. Attitudes of

various segments of the population, backgrounds of individual patients, and residential characteristics combined should
give a more comprehensive picture of the
conditions under which abortion becomes
a choice for an unwanted pregnancy. The
fact that abortion patients (and persons
generally favorable to abortion in polls
and surveys) tend to be higher in socioeconomic status and _ non-Catholic,
whereas abortion areas in the city are low
in income level and more heavily Catholic,
for example, are not necessarily contradictory findings. Aside from the well-known
fact that attitudes and behaviors do not
always coincide, it could mean that this is
a situation similar to that discovered by
Trute and Segal (1977) in their study of
mental patients discharged to sheltered
care facilities. They found census tract
indicators of environmental circumstances
surrounding the residence rather than personal characteristics to be strongly related
to an individual’s level of social integration. Specific to abortion, itis possible that
the single woman, residing without family
supervision or kin ties in an inner city
neighborhood (characterized by low income and the associated factors of low
education, high proportions of foreignborn, and high proportions of Catholics as
well as both high birth rates and illegitimacy rates) is herself in the labor force,
educated, and non-Catholic.* In terms of
her personal profile she is more likely to
risk pregnancy, to be more favorable toward abortion, and therefore she is more
likely to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.

This hypothetical reconstruction, which
is only one of several possible “explana
> The high proportion of persons with Grade 8 or
less relative to the university educated, while not
significantly associated with abortion rates in the
census tracts, is certainly important in aggregate fertility patterns. As Table 1 shows, the education ratio
is significantly related to the other three kinds of

fertility behavior—the birth rate (GFR), the childwoman ratio, and the illegitimacy rate.

tions,” requires two further comments.
One concerns the abortion data themselves. The assumption may be questioned
that the permanent address given by a
patient upon entering the hospital, which
is located in Tract 27, was a correct one.
Establishing the validity of the data would
have been difficult considering the twoyear interval between abortion and use of
the records, but the researcher finds it
hard to see what motives a patient already
identified by name would have in falsifying her address for hospital records. The
second matter is the possible inference of a
middle-class bias in the “explanation” for
the apparent differences between aggregate and individual characterizations of
abortion predisposition. There is no intention of implying that the response of
lower-income persons to available medical
care for preventative services is negligible.
On the contrary, studies made in the
United States, summarized in Harkavey et
al. (1969) indicated that “when modern
family planning services are offered with
dignity and energy, the response of the
poor has been considerable.”

The general conclusion of this preliminary study is that abortion differentials
can be explained in terms of the structure
of population aggregates as well as with
reference to patient background and experience. With a factor analysis it may be
possible to determine more precisely the
nature of the associations between demographic, social, and cultural conditions, as
represented by the selected measures introduced into the correlation matrix of this
study. It suggests an investigation by census tracts of the women who have abortions.

Urban Abortion Rates

24.1

Even prior to the application of more
sophisticated techniques of analysis and
more inclusive factors, it is obvious that
the approach can provide useful information relevant to the practical and moral
issues centering around education and policy in this area of social behavior. At the
simplest level, merely knowing the location of women likely to have abortions
should be helpful for decisions about
where to locate family planning clinics or
mobile units. Beyond this, knowing the
social characteristics of areas with high
abortion rates should provide some insights into the kinds of birth planning educational programs most likely to be effective in reaching the population in those
areas. And finally, ecological findings
about the relationship between various attributes of neighborhoods and abortion
rates further recall that personal behaviors
are very closely tied to social conditions. It
serves as a reminder that not only educating persons, but also improving the quality of personal, family, and community life
is important if fertility behavior is to be
altered. |
