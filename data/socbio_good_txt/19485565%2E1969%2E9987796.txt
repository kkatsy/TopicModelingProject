On the Apparent Subfecundity of

Non-Family Planners

Jeanne Clare Ridley, Mindel C. Sheps,

 

Joan W. Lingner, and Jane A. Menken*

Studies of differential natality within
populations have indicated that women who
adopt family planning typically have a history of higher natality than a comparable
group of non-family planners. Such findings have usually been explained by postulating a higher incidence of sterility and subfecundity among nonplanners (Campbell,
1965; Stycos and Back, 1964).

It is possible, however, that other factors
also affect the natality of non-family planners. In many societies, women do not use
contraceptives until they have achieved
their desired family size. Consequently,
women who experience a combination of
circumstances favorable to attaining their
desired family size are more likely to
adopt contraceptive practices and to use
them effectively. On the other hand, failure
to have the number of children desired and
hence failure to become a family planner
may be due to two kinds of factors that
affect the reproductive process: those determining the components of the intervals
between births (Sheps and Perrin, 1964)
and those that influence the duration of
exposure to the risk of conception.

In order to study the nature of natality
differentials that might be produced by
factors other than subfecundity, relatively
simple experiments were performed using a
simulation model, REPSIM-A (Ridley and
Sheps, 1966). Chance variation in the
components of birth intervals, operating
through fecundability (the monthly probability of conception), through the probability of fetal loss, and through the durations of
pregnancy and of the postpartum nonsusceptible periods, is a basic feature of the
model. For example, even if all women have
the same probability of fetal loss, some
women through chance alone will have a
large number of fetal deaths and thus longer
intervals. Variation in the duration of exposure to the risk of childbirth was introduced
by varying the age at marriage or at sterility.

MODEL AND EXPERIMENTS

REPSIM-A simulates the detailed reproductive history of a hypothetical cohort of
women. The model provides for a woman’s
marrying, dying, becoming sterile, becoming
pregnant (with varying outcomes of pregnancy), and becoming a family planner; it
also provides for the dissolution of marriage
by widowhood or divorce. The probabilities
of these events may vary with age, marital
status, and, in some instances, with parity.
The time of occurrence of any event is de

termined by selecting a random number.
With the exception of family planning, the
model has been described in detail elsewhere
(Ridley and Sheps, 1966).

In the model, a woman is defined as a
family planner once she uses a contraceptive
method for spacing or limiting the number
of births. A woman may become a family
planner at the beginning of her first marital
union or after any live birth, the probabilities varying with parity. The effect of becoming a family planner is to reduce natural
fecundability by the postulated level of
contraceptive effectiveness, which may vary
with parity, Other input includes distributions of the number of children desired and
preferred spacing patterns, Provision for
preferred spacing before a woman attains
her desired family size is made through
specifying a distribution of the duration of
contraceptive use.

Since data on the differential natality of
planners and nonplanners are typically
obtained in surveys of married women,
classified by age as well as planning status
(i.e., ever-planners or never-planners up to
the time of the survey), we attempted to
simulate such data. The present computer
program tabulates women by family-planning status only at the end of the simulated
history. Therefore, the reproductive history
of each cohort, consisting of 1,000 women,
was simulated independently four times,
starting at age 15 but ending at different
ages. Results at ages 25, 30, 35, and 40 were
obtained.

To demonstrate more clearly the effects
of varying the experimental factors, we
decided to sacrifice attempts at realism by
keeping all other factors constant. Thus, for
each simulated cohort, identical assumptions were made regarding the level of fetal
loss, infant mortality, and lengths of the
nonsusceptible periods associated with pregnancy.! Natural fecundability was 0.10 for
all women at all ages. Since the aim was to
simulate survey-type data on surviving

25

married women, we did not include divorce,
widowhood, or mortality.

Further, since the object of the experiments was to study the effects of family
limitation, it was assumed that all women
wanted to prevent further births once the
desired family size was achieved. Consequently, at that point, a woman became a
family planner and used contraceptives
continuously thereafter. Hence, no distribution of spacing preferences was postulated. The desired number of births had a
mean of 3.7 and a standard deviation of
0.9, with the distribution given in Table 1,

Contraceptive effectiveness increased
from 50% at parity three to 90% at parity
seven and above. As will be seen in the simulated data, this relatively low effectiveness
resulted in an average achieved parity
appreciably higher than the average desired
family size.

A factorial design was used, each of two
factors (age at marriage and sterility) being
assumed to operate independently at two
levels. The variations yielded four different
types of cohorts which are designated by
number. For two cohort types, 590 and
592, age at marriage was a constant (exact
age 20).2 For the remaining two, 591 and
594, age at marriage was variable with a

of 3.0 years. In both cases, all women married. In two of the cohort types, 590 and
591, no sterility occurred before age 40. In
the other two, 592 and 594, age at onset of
sterility was variable (Henry, 1935). The
expected percentages of married and of sterile women in the cohort types where these
factors were varied are given in Table 2.

RESULTS

Table 3 presents results for the four
simulated cohorts at age 35. In each cohort,
nonplanners exhibit lower natality than
planners. The natality of planners remains
almost constant between cohorts, while the
natality of nonplanners fluctuates in response to the experimental conditions. Consequently, the magnitude of the differentials
between planners and nonplanners depends
on how the experimental factors affect the
natality of nonplanners.

Before becoming planners, all women in
Cohort 590 are exposed to the same probabilities of the various events. All women
marry at exact age 20 and remain fecund
throughout the period of observation. All
have the same constant fecundability, identical probabilities of fetal loss and infant
mortality, and identical distributions of the
nonsusceptible periods associated with pregnancy. Thus, the only variation between
planners and nonplanners is in the chance

factors affecting the components of the
intervals between births, yet, planners,
despite the use of contraceptives, have more
live births—an average of 4.2 as compared
with 3.6 for nonplanners. The explanation
for this differential is implicit in the cumulative parity distributions. For example,
9.9% of nonplanners have three or fewer
births, while planners all have at least four
births. Some women fail to achieve their
desired family size and hence do not become
planners. Stated another way, women who
through the operation of chance alone, attain high parities are selected as family
planners.

When a variable age at marriage is introduced, as in Cohort 591, the natality differential between planners and nonplanners is
double that observed when chance alone
operates (1.2 vs. 0.6). The planners here
have 4.4 live births on the average, while
the nonplanners have only 3.2. Clearly, the
planners are now selected on the basis of
having a longer marital duration than in
Cohort 590, while the nonplanners have a
shorter marital duration.

At this simulated age of 35 years, the
natality of planners in a cohort with sterility
(592) is the same as in Cohort 590. Sterility
does, however, reduce the natality of nonplanners to 2.9 births. When sterility and a
variable age at marriage are combined (594),
planners again have an average of 4.4 births
as in Cohort 591, while the average is decreased to 2.8 for nonplanners. The interaction between these two factors to some degree offsets the pure effects of each.

The experimental factors also strikingly
affect variability in the number of births.
For each cohort, planners have a standard
deviation of 0.8 or 0.9, giving a coefficient of
variation of 19% to 20%. In contrast, the
natality of nonplanners is more variable in
every cohort. The variation increases with
the introduction of a variable age at marriage, and more markedly when sterility is
introduced. This is due to the increased
incidence of parities of two or fewer among

Subfecundity and Non-Family Planners

27

nonplanners, as seen in the cumulative
parity distribution.

At age 40, the experimental factors also
affect the cumulative parity distributions of
planners (data not shown). Thus, 25% of
planners have four or fewer live births in
Cohort 590, but the percentage increases to
29% in Cohort 591, to 31% in Cohort 592,
and to 35% in Cohort 594. However, the

mean number of live births is still the same
in all cohorts (4.9 or 5.0).

It is of interest to note that the relative
homogeneity of natality behavior observed
among family planners in these simulations
has also been observed in real data. While
our results reflect the low variation in desired family size assumed in these experiments, they do suggest that in the presence
of relatively invariant desired family size
and effective contraceptive practice, little
variation is to be expected in the natality of
family planners.

Another aspect of the selection of planners is illustrated by the data in Table 4,
which shows the number of women in each
cohort type who are planners at specified
ages. Each of the experimental factors depresses to a greater or lesser extent the number of women in the cohorts who have become planners by age 40. While a variable
age at marriage (Cohort 591) increases the
number that have become planners by age
25 and even more so by age 30, slight de

creases are seen at ages 35 and 40 years.
Thus, the effects of earlier marriage are
offset by the women who marry later and
never adopt contraceptive practice.

On the other hand, sterility markedly
reduces the number of women finally adopting contraceptive practice (Cohort 592), an
effect also seen at earlier ages, but to a lesser
degree. Furthermore, when sterility is combined with a variable age at marriage (Cohort 594), it tends to counteract the influence of early marriage.

* Fewer than 20 planners in cohort.

The effects of these factors on the cohort
types previously discussed are further illustrated in Table 5, which presents the natality differentials obtained at different
ages. The effect of chance variation in birth
intervals alone (Cohort 590) produces a
differential of 0.8 in the mean natality of
planners and nonplanners at age 30. This
differential is reduced (by a fourth) at the
older ages. The addition of a variable age
at marriage (Cohort 591) produces a large

 

Social Biology

differential of almost 2.0 births at age 25,
the result of a number of early marriages.
This differential gradually declines with
increasing age but remains sizable, for
example, 1.0 at age 40. In contrast, the
addition of sterility (Cohort 592) produces
a differential of 1.1 births at age 30, but this
differential increases with age to 2.4 at age
40. When the three factors are combined
(Cohort 594), the differences are more irregular and at the various ages the influence of
each factor is more difficult to assess.

CONCLUSIONS

Our results support the hypothesis that
sterility is not the only factor contributing
to the low natality of nonplanners. Any factor, including chance variation, which acts
to depress the natality of some women, has
a role in the selection of family planners and
hence in the natality difference between
planners and nonplanners. With the rather
simple assumptions used here, the factors
studied have effects at each simulated age,
but their relative importance changes with
age. Therefore, it is to be expected that in
survey data differentials might be produced
at any age by a variety of causes. Thus, it
may be erroneous to attribute observed
differentials entirely to the sterility or subfecundity of nonplanners.
