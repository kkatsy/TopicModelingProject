ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study is to determine how children’s health conditions are related
to their mothers’ risk of divorce or separation. The study is based on data from over 7,000 children born to once-married mothers identified in the 1988 Child Health Supplement to the National Health Interview Survey. The effects of 15 childhood health conditions on the mothers’
risk of divorce are estimated with Cox’s proportional hazard models. Controlling for demographic, marital, and reproductive measures, we find that mothers’ prospects for divorce are affected both positively or negatively by their children’s health status, depending on the type of
childhood condition and, in the case of low birth weight children, timing within the marriage.
Women whose children have congenital heart disease, cerebral palsy, are blind, or had low birth
weight appear to have higher risks of marital disruption than mothers of healthy children. In
contrast, mothers whose children have migraines, learning disabilities, respiratory allergies,

missing/deformed digits or limbs, or asthma have somewhat lower rates of divorce.

Two questions about children’s health
and their mothers’ risk of marital disruption are addressed in this study. First, do
mothers of children with specific serious
or permanent health problems have higher
or lower risks of divorce than mothers
with healthier children? Second, is the relationship between divorce and children’s
health status explained by factors assoctated with both the risk of marital disruption and the onset of serious childhood
health conditions?

The two questions are motivated by
concerns about family well-being. The
impact of illness on families has long
been a policy consideration. Usually,
these effects are described in terms of
medical expenditures. What is less clear,
yet potentially as catastrophic, 1s how
family cohesion is affected when a child
has a serious health condition. Growing
evidence on the negative effects of divorce on children (Amato, 1993) raises
particular concern in this context. If di
vorce rates are higher than expected
among couples with children in poor
health, then the longer-term adverse consequences of a child’s poor health may be
exacerbated, especially for severe conditions. Alternatively, the presence of a
child in poor health may strengthen the
couple’s resolve to care for the child and
thereby reduce their chances of divorce.
Current knowledge about the relationship
between children’s health status and their
parents’ risk of divorce is limited.
Generally, the risk of divorce varies by
the number, ages, and timing of children.
Marital stability is greatest when children
are young and their total number is moderate (i.e., two to three children). Marital stability tends to be lower among couples
with five or more children (Heaton, 1990).
Older or premaritally-born children increase the chances of divorce for first marriages (Martin and Bumpass 1989; Waite
and Lillard, 1991; Wineberg, 1988). In contrast, the likelihood of divorce decreases

159

160

the longer a woman waits to have her first
child (Wineberg, 1988). This relationship
has not changed for marriage cohorts
since 1960, but the risk of divorce has
generally increased across marriage cohorts for any marital duration (Chadwick
and Heaton, 1992).

The evidence on divorce rates among
parents of children with serious health conditions is mixed. While studies from the
1970’s reported high divorce rates among
parents of chronically ill children (Finley et
al., 1979; Gath, 1977; Lansky et al., 1978;
Martin, 1978; Tew et al., 1974), most of the
recent research found no significant difference in the divorce rate of couples with seriously ill children compared to couples in
the general population (Hauenstein, 1990;
Longo and Bond, 1984; McCubbin, 1989;
Sabbeth and Leventhal, 1984; Yura, 1987).
Much of this past work, however, does not
control for potential confounders such as
the presence and number of other children,
or the timing of a child’s birth within the
life course of the marriage (Finley et al.,
1979; Gath, 1977; Hauenstein, 1990; Lansky et al., 1978; Longo and Bond, 1984;
Martin, 1978; McCubbin, 1989; Palfrey et
al., 1989; Sabbeth and Leventhal, 1984;
Silbert et al., 1982; Tew et al., 1974; Yura,
1987). Past work has also generally relied on
small, cross-sectional, convenience samples.

Exceptions are recent studies by Corman
and Kaestner (1992) and Mauldon (1992).
Based on the large, nationally representative 1981 and 1988 Child Health Supplements to the National Health Interview Surveys, both conclude that an unhealthy child
decreases the mother’s likelihood of being
married. The study reported here complements theirs by focusing on specific health
conditions (e.g., blindness, cerebral palsy),
instead of more subjective or broadly defined health measures (e.g., “disabled”).

Joesch and Smith

 

Social Biology

While subjective measures of a child’s
health status are useful in that they represent a summary of the parent’s view of the
child’s condition, such measures tend to be
based on circumstances at the time of the
survey rather than over the duration of the
condition: These summary measures may
also be limited by social desirability effects
and recall bias, and colored by the respondent’s marital status at the time the data are
collected (Angel and Woreby, 1988). Other
broadly-defined measures, such as total
number of physical health conditions, may
mask the range of marital effects experienced by parents, since milder and more severe conditions are treated equivalently.

An analysis of divorce rates by health
conditions raises the question whether specific conditions have inherent effects on the
divorce risk. It is not suggested here that
this is the case, but rather that more serious
conditions may impact marital quality differently than less serious conditions. While
it would be preferable to work with measures that assess directly how the quality of
a marriage is affected by the severity of a
child’s health problems, in the absence of
such information, different health conditions are used as indirect indicators.

CHILD HEALTH AND THE RISK
OF DIVORCE

The question remains why marriages
may be more or less stable when a sick
child is present, and why some conditions
may create stronger effects than others.
The literature suggests a number of mechanisms that can lead to positive as well as
negative changes in family dynamics.

Two theoretical perspectives predict
that marriages with seriously ill children
have higher divorce rates than those with
healthy children. First, Friedman et al.
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 44, No. 3-4

(1994) argue that the “uncertainty reduction principle” leads us to engage in behaviors that are likely to reduce uncertainty
about the future. While marriage in general
is a strategy for reducing uncertainty, “the
instability of marriages is yet another
source of uncertainty” (Friedman et al.,
1994, p. 383). Some childhood chronic
health conditions are so severe and permanent (e.g., cerebral palsy or congenital heart
disease) that they are likely to introduce
challenges and stresses to the family that
can destabilize a marriage, increasing parents’ uncertainty about the future and
thereby the probability that the partner who
expects to be the noncustodial parent after
the break-up seeks a divorce. For conditions
that are more episodic, not as severe, and
may disappear after some time (e.g., migraines, allergies), parents can be realistically optimistic that the child will improve
and that they can be active players in helping their child. The uncertainty reduction
principle predicts that parents in this latter
group will have divorce rates similar to parents of healthy children.

Second, within economics and sociology, some suggest that children represent
“marital-specific capital.’ Children as
marital-specific capital increase the net
gain from marriage, enhancing marital
stability (Waite and Lillard, 1991; Becker
et al., 1977). If a child is less able to meet
parental expectations (e.g., diminished
parental enjoyment and pride), then the
child’s marital-specific capital is lower
than anticipated, leading to a lower than
expected gain from the marital relationship and a higher divorce risk.

Alternatively, increased parental concern about the adverse effects of divorce
on a child with a chronic condition may
enhance rather than reduce marital stability. Prevailing social norms encourage

 

Children’s Health 161

couples with children to stay together
more than childless couples, and these expectations may be even higher for parents
of specia]-needs children.

Some perspectives suggest both positive
and negative marital consequences when
seriously ill children are present. Children
with special needs are likely to increase
their parents’ emotional and financial
strain. While the same could be said for
any marriage with children, the difference
with unhealthy children is the prospect of
long-term hardships stemming from additional medical and social support costs
(Birenbaum et al., 1990). On the other
hand, these additional costs, including the
possibility of losing health insurance (Berk
and Taylor, 1984), could increase the financial burden of single parenthood to such an
extent that a divorce becomes unattractive
to the likely custodial parent.

The added time needed to raise a child
with special needs can be considerable.
Marriages may be strengthened by either
increasing the specialization of roles (one
parent is the primary caregiver while the
other is the primary breadwinner) (Traustadottir, 1991), or through more equal
role-sharing (both parents share in both
roles). However, a parent’s role as caregiver can be over-specialized to the point
where it has a negative effect on their
marriage (Pearlin and Turner, 1987).

In summary, theoretical perspectives
suggest that a sick child may have a stabilizing or destabilizing effect on the parents’ marriage.

examined with the Child Health Supplement to the 1988 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS-CH). The NHIS js an
annual nationwide household survey of
the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. population. The 1988 NHIS-CH was administered to NHIS sample households with
at least one child under age 18 (Dawson,
1991). Within these households, one child
was sampled at random, providing information for 17,110 children between the
ages of 0 and 17. The survey was conducted with the adult family member who
knew “most about health related matters”
of the sample child, typically the mother.

In selecting the subsample for this study,
the following criteria were applied. First,
the sample child had to be born while the
biological parents were married to each
other. Second, the biological mother had to
be married only once; the questionnaire
was structured such that marital history information was ambiguous otherwise. Third,
at the time of the interview, the sample
child had to live with the biological mother.
Too few children of divorced families were
living with biological fathers to conduct a
meaningful analysis of this group. Fourth,
the onset of the sample child’s health condition had to occur while their parents were
married and over one year before the divorce or interview date. Conditions beginning during the year prior to a divorce may
be the result of the impending divorce
rather than a contributing cause.

For sample size reasons, divorces and
separations were combined into one category. The two marital states will be referred to as “divorced” for the remainder
the paper.

MODEL AND VARIABLE DESCRIPTION

One way in which the effect of a
child’s health could be assessed is by in
Joesch and Smith

Social Biology

vestigating its impact on marital quality.
In the absence of such data, indicators of
specific health conditions provide indirect
measures of the variety of psychosocial
and economic challenges introduced into
the family. Accordingly, children’s health
conditions were selected from the NHISCH to range in severity and permanency
and to be less likely subject to recall bias
with respect to the occurrence and the onset dates of these conditions. The latter
is particularly important for a divorced
mother who is recalling her child’s health
when the marriage was intact (Dawson,
1991). Drawing on Newacheck and Taylor (1992), the conditions examined here
are missing or deformed limbs/back/hands/
feet, severe headaches or migraines, allergies, asthma, deafness, speech defects,
blindness, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, congenital heart disease, low birth weight, developmental delays, learning disabilities, and
emotional/behavior problems.

Divorce hazard rates are analyzed with
Cox’ proportional hazard regression models. Each health condition is entered as a
dummy variable into its own regression.
In contrast to earlier studies, standard errors for parameters in the regression
models are estimated with SUDAAN 6.0
software (Shah et al., 1993) to account
for the complex NHIS-CH sample design. In addition, all results are weighted
to reflect national population estimates.

The divorce hazard rate is defined as
the probability of divorce at time #, given
the couple is still married just prior to ¢.
For children who remain free of the
selected health conditions (“healthy”
group), ¢ = 0 at the sample child’s birth.
Children who become 1] have two parts
to their lives: the portions before and after the onset of the health condition.
While children are healthy, they are conDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

sidered part of the “healthy” group. The
portion of the child’s record that occurs
after the disease is apparent is part of the
“4” group. For this group, ¢ = 0 at the
onset of the condition.

For marriages still intact in 1988,
marital duration is censored at the time
of the interview. Marriages ending
through spousal death are censored at the
time of widowhood.

Several covariates are included in the
model to address possible confounding.
The arrival of children, healthy or otherwise, may affect marital quality differently depending upon the stage of the
marriage. Generally, when children are
born into relatively new marriages, parents are more likely to experience divorce
than when children are born into older
marriages (Wineberg, 1988). Apart from
access to greater socioeconomic resources, older marriages are more stable
than younger ones because most unhappy
marriages have already dissolved during
the early years of marriage. The “length
of marriage at t = 0” covariate adjusts for
differences in the duration of marriages at
the time of birth/disease onset.

It is possible that there is an interaction effect between the onset of the health
condition and the duration of the marriage, that is, the effect may differ depending on whether the child is born earlier or later in the marriage. To address
this possibility, the analysis distinguishes
whether a low versus normal birth weight
child is born within the first two years of
the marriage or afterwards. The limited
number of cases for many health conditions did not allow a more detailed investigation of this issue.

The model further includes a measure
of whether the child was born less than
eight months into the marriage. Women

Children’s Health 163

who marry while pregnant may bear a
child who is at higher risk for health
problems due to the stressful nature of
the marriage and the decreased likelihood
of adequate prenatal care. These marriages are also at higher risk of divorce
(Wineberg, 1988).

Health problems of other family members may affect marital stability as well.
For other family members the NHIS does
not provide information on the dates of
disease onset beyond 12 months prior to
the interview. To consider the relationship
between family members’ health and
marital stability indirectly, the analysis
controls whether the mother or any sibling is unable to perform major activities
at the time of the interview. Being unable
to perform one’s major activity is most
likely the result of an ongoing chronic
condition that preceded rather than followed a divorce.

Additionally, the model contains maternal measures of the mother’s age at
marriage, her education, whether she is
African American, whether she had a
child premaritally, the birth order of the
sample child, and her marriage cohort.
Previous studies indicate that these factors are related to the risk of divorce
(White, 1990).

Other measures of socioeconomic status in the NHIS-CH that may be relevant
for a divorce analysis pertain to conditions at the time of the interview rather
than the time of the child’s birth or the
marriage. If these measures could be the
consequence of the child’s health status
or the divorce rather than precursor, they
were not used. For respondents who were
divorced by the interview date, no data
were collected on the child’s father while
the marriage was intact. Accordingly, no
father data were included in the analysis.

Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for
the covariates. The covariates are used to
estimate adjusted hazard rates.

RESULTS

Table 2 lists parameter estimates, unadjusted and adjusted hazard rate ratios
(RR), and their 95 per cent confidence
limits derived from Cox regression models for 15 health conditions. The results
are arranged from smallest to largest effect. The RR’s are based on comparisons
between the divorce hazard rates among
women whose children have selected
health conditions and the divorce hazard
rate for women with children in the
“healthy” group (i.e., the children who are
or were free of the 15 health conditions).
The unweighted number of children with
a given health condition and the number
whose mothers experienced a divorce are
listed in the last two columns of Table 2.

Marriages with children who have congenital heart disease, cerebral palsy, or
who are blind have divorce rates that are 2
to 3 times Aigher than those with healthy
children. However, marriages with children who have migraines, a learning disability, or a respiratory allergy have significantly Jower rates of divorce. Mothers
of children who have asthma or a permanent deformity or loss of limbs/digits also
have somewhat lower divorce rates.

The results presented in Table 3 show
that women who had a low birth weight
child were more likely to get divorced
than women whose child had a normal
birth weight if the birth occurred in the
first two years of the marriage rather than
later.

The effects of the control variables
(available upon request) generally support
findings of other recent longitudinal studies

 

Joesch and Smith

Social Biology

(Heaton, 1990; Waite and Lillard, 1991).
Mothers who are African American, had a
premarital birth, give birth to the sample
child at a young age, marry while pregnant,
are members of recent marriage cohorts,
and are unable to perform major activities
are more likely to divorce than mothers
without these characteristics.

DISCUSSION

This paper explores the effects of children’s health conditions on their mothers’
risk of divorce. Two questions were raised
for which preliminary answers are provided. First, we found that mothers of
children with serious or permanent health
problems have both higher and lower risks
of divorce than mothers of healthier children, depending upon the condition. Second, these relationships are not necessarily explained by confounding factors that
may affect both the risk of divorce and the
onset of the health conditions. After controlling for demographic, marital, and reproductive measures in addition to proxies
for mothers’ and siblings’ health, the same
health conditions had similar effects (positive or negative) on the risk of divorce.

It 1s recognized that condition-specific
analyses may incorrectly attribute effects
of one condition to another if they occur
together. For example, low birth weight
children are at greater risk of experiencing severe health conditions including
blindness, deafness, congenital heart disease, and cerebral palsy (Miller et al.,
1989). A model that examined the effects
of these health conditions and controlled
for low birth weight (not shown) found
insignificant effects for deafness and
cerebral palsy and significant effects for
blindness and congenital heart disease
similar to those reported in Table 2.

icant, the magnitude of these effects is

examining summary indices of health instead (Corman and Kaestner, 1992;
Mauldon, 1992) has its own limitations.

As an alternative, one could use information about the mother’s assessment of
how her child is affected by the condition
as an indirect measure of its impact on
the mother’s marriage. The NHIS-CH reports the mothers’ perceptions of how
much each condition “bothers” the child
during the past year and the limitations it
imposes on the child’s “daily activities.”
Newacheck and Taylor (1992) show, for

example, that for all mothers (married or
not), frequent headaches or ear infections
generate more “bother” to the child than
heart disease or cerebral palsy. On the
other hand, cerebral palsy limits the
child’s “usual activity” more than frequent ear infections, with heart disease
and frequent headaches both having intermediate effects. These findings suggest
that the relationship between a particular

childhood chronic health condition and
the mother’s perception is complex, but
also that these measures are imperfect because the mother was not asked to name
specific reasons as to why she perceives
her child’s condition the way she does. A
further problem is that some assessments
were obtained after a divorce.

A potential limitation of this study is
its reliance on a modest number of variables measured at or prior to the child’s
birth. Using the variables listed in Table 1
ensures that their values are not the result
of the child’s birth or health conditions.
Another concern is the possibility of reverse Causation, whereby a child’s health
status may be the result of the parents’
low marital quality. While this argument
does not apply to the observed protective
effects, it is also not likely to explain
the findings for blindness and congenital
heart disease. To examine the reverse causation scenario fully, future studies need
to secure more information about the marriage prior to the birth, including measures of marital quality and access to prenatal care.

Another possible limitation of the
study is its sample. As noted, women who
remarried after their divorce had to be excluded from the analysis. If mothers with
healthy children are more likely to remarry in the general population, then
their divorce rate in the sample is lower
than the true divorce rate. For health conditions that are associated with lower divorce rates, our results thus underestimate the real difference in the divorce
rates between the “healthy” and “unhealthy” groups and hence are conservative. However, since the remarriage rate
among mothers with young children
tends to be low overall, any bias in the results is likely to be small.

 

  

Children’s Health 167

Two other sources of biases may influence the results, although steps were
taken to minimize or identify their effects. First, divorced mothers may report
more health problems than married mothers (Angel and Woreby, 1988). This finding would suggest more reportedly ill
children among divorced families. Overreporting of childhood illness among divorced mothers is unlikely to be a problem for the protective effects observed
here. Second, if marriages with seriously
ill children comprise a disproportionate
share of bad marriages (where the quality
of marriages is unobservable), one would
expect a higher divorce rate for this group
and one could have argued for reverse
causation. Instead, protective effects were
found for several conditions, while two to
three adverse effects were observed for
conditions that are unlikely to be the result of bad marriages.

In closing, it is important to emphasize
that this study is based on a nationally
representative sample of children in 1988.
The children in this analysis had to be
alive to be part of the sample (a feature of
the NHIS-CH). As a result, children with
some of the most severe health conditions
were more likely to have died and were
thereby excluded from the sample. This
study is, therefore, not in a position to
discuss the impact of infant or child mortality on the marriage of surviving parents. In this light, the findings are probably conservative.

These initial analyses indicate the importance of children’s health for the stability of their mothers’ marriages. If some
children’s illnesses are more likely to
hasten the demise of marriages by contributing to family stress, it will be important to determine whether the children’s
health status declines further during the

post-divorce years It will also be important to identify characteristics of marnages
that do not dissolve despite the potential
stresses encountered from the children’s
medical conditions and whether there 1s an
interaction effect for the onset of a health
condition relative to the duration of the
mariage
