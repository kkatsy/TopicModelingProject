Chairman’s Opening Statement

Clyde V. Kiser*

 

Chairman, Session on Black Demography, Population Association of America

1971 Annual Meetings, Washington, DC.

The dynamics of population since World
War II have been especially active among
Negroes in this country. Over three-fourths
of the blacks lived in the South in 1940.
Today slightly over one-half dwell in that
region. In 1940, less than half of the blacks
lived in metropolitan areas. Today nearly
three-fourths live in metropolitan areas.

There has been vertical as well as spatial
mobility of the Negro. On a relative basis,
gains in occupation, income, and education have been greater among blacks than
among whites, but wide differentials still
exist.

With respect to births, the blacks conspicuously outdid the whites in the postwar
baby boom. They resemble the whites with
respect to patterns of decline in birth rates
since 1957. Reflecting in part the delay of
health progress among the blacks, the
recent proportionate gains in life expectency have been somewhat larger for blacks
than for whites.

In keeping with the growing interest in
the economic, social, and demographic
status of the blacks, a session on “Black
Demography” was held April 22~24, 1971,
at the meetings of the Population Associa
* Milbank Memorial Fund, New York, New
York,

tion of America in Washington, D.C. Several of the speakers and discussants had
previously participated in a conference on
“Demographic Aspects of the Black Community” which was held in October, 1969,
under the auspices of the Milbank Memorial Fund. The proceedings of that conference were published as Part Two of
the April 1970 Milbank Memorial Fund
Quarterly.

The papers and discussions presented at
the session on “Black Demography” are
brought together in the pages that follow.
It is believed that a wide band of reciprocal relevance exists between the two subjects “Black Demography” and “Social
Biology.”

In the initial paper, Dr. Reynolds Farley
of the University of Michigan presents
some indicators of recent demographic
change among blacks. His indicators are
based largely upon census data. In the
second paper Dr. Joseph S. Himes of the
University of North Carolina at Greensboro describes certain characteristics of
migration of blacks in the United States.
His paper is briefly discussed by Dr.
Daniel O. Price of the University of Texas
at Austin. In the third paper, Dr. Gordon
F. Sutton of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst assesses the mortality and

morbidity disadvantages of the black population of the United States. Dr. Paul B.
Cornely of Howard University presents a
discussion of this paper. In the final paper,
Dr. Grant Bogue of Western Illinois Uni
versity argues that the category “race’’ is
not needed in the census and in demographic analysis. A rebuttal to this point
of view is given by Dr. G. Franklin
Edwards of Howard University.
