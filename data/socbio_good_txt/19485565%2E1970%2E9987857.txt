Brief Reports

PTC Tasting and Dental Caries

Chung, Witkop, and Henry (1964) report
an association of higher risk for dental caries
in deciduous but not in permanent teeth
with nontasting of phenylthiourea (PTC).
Data collected on a Mexican population
some time ago permit us to test the association of nontasting of PTC to the number of
diseased, missing, and filled (DMF) permanent teeth of adults.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

One of us took a series of measurements
and observations on 296 adult males and 180
adult females in Paracho, Michoacan, Mexico, in 1948. Teeth were examined in daylight
without a dental mirror or probe. The number of missing and filled teeth recorded
should be reasonably accurate, but small
carious lesions would have been missed.
Nevertheless, there is no basis for biases in
the observation of DMF, especially since the
present use of the data was not contemplated at the time.

Phenylthiourea-impregnated paper was
used to determine taste sensitivity. Responses of “nada” (nothing) and “papel”
(paper) are classified as nontaster. All other

individuals tested are grouped together as
tasters; most said “‘amargo” (bitter). Although the paper test may not give satisfactory absolute values for calculating the frequencies of tasters and nontasters, it should
serve adequately for internal comparisons.
There is no reason to expect any bias since
the classification of tasters was done prior to
and without reference to the present analysis.
RESULTS

Nontasters occur significantly more frequently in males (79 of 296 = 26.7%) than
in females (13 of 180 = 7.2%). Because of
the small number of female nontasters in
this study, further analysis is limited to the
male series.

Preliminary analysis yields no statistically significant difference in number of
DMF between tasters and nontasters although the median number of carious teeth
in both young and old adult males tends to
be higher in nontasters than in tasters. The
proportion of adult males with few and
with many DMF differs little between
tasters and nontasters. Thirty-six sibships
in the present study contained both tasters

and nontasters of PTC. These yield 15 sister-sister pairs, 26 brother-brother pairs,
and 34 sister-brother pairs in which one
member is a PTC taster and the other is not.
The number of DMF teeth in tasters compared with nontasters respectively is larger
in 40, fewer in 29, and the same in 6. None
of these sets of data either singly or in combination excludes the probability of the difference between tasters and nontasters being
due to random variation at the P = 0,05
level by chi-square test.

DMF and age are highly correlated (r =
0.57), however. When the regression of
caries on age (an increase of 0.30 DMF per
year) is discounted, tasters have a mean of
2.54 fewer DMF per mouth than nontasters
and the difference is statistically significant
(t = 3.24, P < 0.01).

DISCUSSION

Chung et al. (1964) report a significant
relationship between diseased, extracted,
and filled (def) teeth in the deciduous dentition and taste response; PTC tasters have a
28% lower risk for caries. They found no
significant relationship with DMF of the permanent dentition. Tibera-Dumitru et al.
(1965) report, in both sexes in each of three
communities, adult tasters under age 40 or
50 had more dental caries than nontasters,
but the converse in subjects over 40 or 50

years of age respectively; our results are
consonant with those for younger adults in
Tibera-Dumitru et al. The differences among
the three studies (Chung et al., TiberaDumitru et al., and the present one) suggest
that more than one factor is involved and
that the relationship is complex. The interaction with race does not seem to be a factor
in our results. In general, Mexican Indians
seem to have lower frequencies of tasters
than do Europeans (Giles et al., 1968),
Nevertheless, although shovel-shaped incisors are a reasonable criterion for distinguishing proportion of Indian ancestry in a
mestizo population (see Lasker, 1953; PintoCisternas and Figueroa, 1968) the present
series yields no significant difference in
frequency of degree of shovel-shaped incisors between tasters and nontasters. The
finding of an association between nontasting
of PTC and dental caries remains to be
confirmed and explained.?

1In addition, a study by a junior-high-school
student (Robert A. Lasker, unpublished) of 50
fellow students aged 12.5-14.5 years of age employed
a serial dilution method for PTC taste threshold and
transillumination for the examination of the teeth.
Of 50 students, 8 were nontasters to serial dilution
#5 or less (i.e., 0.0081/100 or stronger solutions of
PTC). Of the 8 nontasters, 6 had above median and
2 had below median proportions of carious or repaired permanent teeth. The difference in affected
teeth between tasters and nontasters was not

statistically significant, but was in the same direction as that reported here.
