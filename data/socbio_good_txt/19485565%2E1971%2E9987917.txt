Intrinsic Rate of Natural Increase

among the Pahira

Fitness in the Darwinian sense is defined
in terms of the ability of an individual or of
a population to leave behind progeny. The
greater the number of progeny one leaves
behind, the higher one’s fitness to the particular environmental niche inhabited. Fitness
defined in this manner is therefore a function of the fertility and mortality patterns a
population experiences at a given point in
time. The best single measure of fitness is
considered to be the intrinsic rate of natural
increase, r, which measures the capacity of
a population to grow under the existing patterns of fertility and mortality, assuming a
stable population with an unchanging age
structure determined solely by its stable
fertility and mortality schedules and without in- or out-migration.

The importance in genetics of this population parameter, r, was appreciated fairly
early (Fisher, 1930), but it has only recently
begun to be applied by human population
geneticists (Roberts, 1968). Data from only
a limited number of populations are thus far
available. Comparative data from populations in different socioeconomic levels are
urgently needed, in order to assess their relative potentialities for survival and contribution to the genetic makeup of the future
population of a specified area, as well as of
the species as a whole.

Demographic information was collected
from the Pahira, a food-gathering tribal
community of eastern India, as part of a
population genetical survey of this community, beginning early 1963. The Northern
Pahira inhabit the foothills and slopes of the

Ajodhya hills in Purulia District, West Bengal, and the two groups of Southern Pahira,
those of the Dalma hills and the ranges beyond the Subarnarekha river, live in Singhbhun and Ranchi districts, Bihar. A detailed
report on the results of our survey has
been presented elsewhere (Basu, 1969) and
provides information we have not been able
to include in this brief report. Subsequently,
the data were further analyzed to calculate
the intrinsic rate of natural increase, by sex,
separately for the three partially endogamous subgroups of the Pahira—the Northern Pahira, Southern Pahira I, and Southern Pahira Ii. The values of r obtained are
presented here not only to provide. data
but also to demonstrate that this parameter
can be estimated for unsophisticated populations like the Pahira for which life tables
or birth and death registration data are not
available, from the kind of information obtainable by intensive surveys.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Extensive genealogies were collected covering the entire Pahira population. The information collected on every living individual was name, age, sex, residence, birth

place, marital condition, and position in an

extended genealogy. In addition, for adults,
information on children ever born, in order
of birth, sex and age or age at death of children, age at death of spouses (whenever
possible) in case of widows or widowers, sibs
by age or age at death and in order of birth
(as far as the informant could remember)
was collected.

The method followed in calculating r was
essentially that of Birch (1948) as described
by Roberts (1968) and the data are presented in Table 1. However, the proportion surviving to a given age (/,) and the mean number of offspring produced per person during
a given 5-year age period (mz) could not be
calculated directly in the absence of reliable
records either of age at death for most of
those who died after adulthood or age of
mothers at birth of the children who subsequently died. The difficulties were circumvented in the following ways.

Fairly reliable information on age at
death of children could be obtained from the
mothers. Taking elderly mothers only
(where the youngest child was around 20
years of age), the number of offspring ever
born and the number dying in 0-4, 5-9,
10-14, 15-19 age groups were counted. From
these numbers, proportion surviving to age
x were calculated up to lo (4s = all births
— deaths 0-4 / all births). If we consider the fact that some women in the population died young (for instance, during or
immediately after birth of the first child)
and their children died with them (due to
lack of maternal care), inclusion of these
women in our sample would have increased

Social Biology

our estimate of mortality and decreased that
of survival. In other words, the estimate of
mortality obtained from our sample which
comprises living elderly (S0-++) women only
probably underestimates the true mortality
and overestimates the true probability of
survival, Since some of the children born to
these women were around 20 at the time of
this investigation and therefore had not
lived long enough to die after 20, estimation
of /25 and over from these data did not seem
useful,

A small number of “adult sibships” (comprising adult sibs, where information was
collected from the sibs and not from their
parents who were long dead) in which the
ages at death of adult sibs were available
from the surviving ones or from the spouses
of the dead ones was used to calculate Joo
and over. It was assumed that the total
number of individuals in these “adult sibships” represented survivors over age 15,
i.e., these adults remembered those of their
sibs who survived to age 15 or over. This assumption is based on the fact that the earliest age at death of sibs mentioned by surviving adults is in the period 15-19. By
equating this number to the proportion surviving to age 15 (as obtained from the

“young sibships”) and projecting backward,
the total number of births in the ‘‘adult sibships” was estimated.

From the estimated total number of
births and the reported number of survivors
to age x (x = 20, 25, ...) in the “adult sibships,” calculation of the proportion surviving to age x was straightforward. Finally,
i, values for “young” and “adult” sibships
were put together. The assumption involved
in putting together the /, values for the
“young” and “adult” sibships is that the
mortality pattern has not changed over the
years. The same assumption is involved in
pooling together different cohorts in the
“young sibships” as in the “adult sibships.”’
The assumption does not seem unrealistic
since the way of life does not seem to have
changed to any considerable extent in this
population on which the effects of overall
modernization in the country have hardly,
if at all, made any impact.

The pedigrees used to calculate the m,
values were those in which the mothers, as
well as all the offspring ever born to them,
were alive at the time of this investigation
(so that the age of mothers at birth of each
child could be calculated from the difference
between the mother’s and the child’s age),
and those in which the dead offspring was
between two surviving ones so that the
mother’s age group at the birth of the dead
child could be estimated (e.g., if two surviving children were born at mother’s age 20
and 25, then the dead one born in-between
must have been born in the age period 2024).

These pedigrees were only a part of all
the pedigrees collected. For the pedigrees in
which the mothers lost many of the children
born to them, age of the mother at birth of
each child could not be guessed and therefore such pedigrees were excluded from this
analysis. The assumption implied in using
such mz values obtained from the kind of
pedigrees described above as representative
of the population is that there is no remark

able variation in fertility between the mothers who have lost many offspring and those
who have not. Further, the fact that some of
the mothers were still in their reproductive
period at the time of our investigation and
were expected to produce more offspring
implies that the m, values obtained were
underestimates of the true values, but
probably the differences were not large. Finally, several cohorts were pooled in calculating the m, values, on the assumption that
the fertility pattern had not changed over
the years.

The calculations of the J, values were
based on all pedigrees with mothers aged 50
or above and all reliable “adult sibships.”
The m, values were obtained from all pedigrees in which the mother’s age at birth of all
children could be assessed. However, these
pedigrees do not include all the pedigrees at
our disposal since some pedigrees lacking the
desired information had to be excluded.
Therefore, the estimates are subject to sampling variance and will have to be viewed
with caution. |

Once the /, and m, values were obtained,
the 4 /, mz figures were computed. The mz
values were halved on the assumption that
half of the total offspring born in a given
period were male and half female. The value
of r was obtained by iteration, trying out
different values of r until the column (e***)
(3 lL, mz) added up approximately to 54.5982
(i.e., e4). The choice of e* did not have
any special significance; other powers of e
(e7, e®, etc.) could be used instead.

The same procedure was followed for
calculating r for the male samples.

RESULTS

The results of our computation of r are
given in Table 2.

The rfemate values show that the Northern Pahira (N.P.) may be precarious but
the Southern Pahira (S.P.) I and II are
slightly better off. In genetic terms, considering females only, the N.P. gene pool is

relatively unfit, the S.P. I more fit and the
S.P. IT the fittest of all the three subgroups.
In general, this seems to be due to the increasing probability of leaving viable female
offspring (considering the 3 1, m, column in
Table 1) from the N.P., through the S.P. I,
to the S.P. JI. We do not have any medical
data on the relative prevalence of the different diseases affecting fertility and mortality
in the three subgroups, and therefore, the
selective forces responsible for the observed
fitness differentials cannot be conjectured.
However, it is worth pointing out that the
impression obtained from the 7temaie Values
agrees with that obtained from our computation of the index of total selection intensity, I, (Crow, 1958), presented elsewhere
(Basu, 1967): 1.133, 0.738, and 0.687 in the
N.P., S.P. I and S.P. II, respectively. The
reliability of both results seems increased by
agreement between the impressions given by
the r and the Z values, which were calculated
from the same kind of information, i.e., fer
tility and mortality, but on the basis of

somewhat different samples (for J most of
the pedigrees available were utilized, whereas for r only a small part of them were used).
If this trend of increasing capacity for
growth from the N.P., to the $.P. I and the
S.P. Il, in that order, has continued for a
fairly long time, it may explain the difference in the population sizes (N.P., 301; S.P.
I, 475; S.P. IL, 577) of the three subgroups;
if it should continue in the future, the S.P.
II component of the Pahira population as a
whole will gradually increase, with the result that the gene frequency of the Pahira

Social Biology

as a whole for any given locus will change
gradually in the direction of the S.P. II gene
frequency of that locus. This may be an important mechanism of microdifferentiation
of a population in the time-scale, not necessarily involving selective advantage or disadvantage of specific alleles, but merely as a
function of differential growth potentials of
its constituent subgroups. Similar analyses
of other subdivided populations are necessary in order to assess the importance of this
mechanism for human microevolution in
general,

The rmate Values differ from those of the
females. The male values are all positive,
and while the S.P. IT has the highest value,
as in the female, the lowest value occurs in
the S.P. I rather than in the N.P. The increasing capacity for growth from the N.P.
to the S.P. [and S.P. I, in that order, is not
apparent in the case of males. The sex difference is relatively slight in the case of the
S.P. II, but is more marked in the N.P. and
S.P. I. The 7 value is lower for males than
females in the S.P. I and S.P. II, but higher
in the N.P.

We do not offer any interpretation of the
sex difference. Small sample size leading to
high sampling variance of the estimate is a
possibility. Alternatively, the m, values for
males might have been underestimated.
When the information on children ever born
to a male was collected from the father
(when the mother was dead) fewer of those
children who died shortly after birth might
have been mentioned than when the information was collected from the women since
men tend to forget about these children
more than women do. This explanation does
not apply to the N.P., unless we assume that
in this case the women were more forgetful,
which seems to be unrealistic.

Another explanation may be the relatively lower fertility of males in the S.P. I
and $.P. II, not in the N.P. This explanation is suggested by the m, columns and the
net reproduction rates and a remarkably

Vol. 18, No. 2

higher probability of survival for the males
in the N.P. compared to the smaller and inconsistent pattern of sexual difference in the
J, values in the S.P. I and S.P. I. The relatively lower fertility of the males may be explained under the assumption that given the
prevailing social situation it is virtually impossible for a woman to live singly for any
considerable length of time and support
herself, but this is not true for a man. Thus,
a woman is constantly exposed to the chance
of reproduction while a man is not. Apparently this explanation does not apply to
the N.P. situation. The probability of an
individual to marry more than once cannot
be related to the individual’s fertility because in all three subgroups men have a
higher probability of marrying more than
once than females (Basu, 1969).

As a final comment, comparing the r values above with the r value of 0.0190 for
India as a whole during 1951-61, it appears
that while all but the N.P. female value suggest a moderate rate of growth for the

Brief Reports

Pahiras, the rates are lower than that of the
country as a whole. It seems that the
Pahiras are not partaking in the “explosive”’
population growth in India.

SUMMARY

The intrinsic rate of natural increase, r,
has been calculated for the Pahira, a foodgathering tribe of eastern India, to indicate
that this parameter can be at least tentatively estimated for an unsophisticated
population. The method of computation
and the assumptions involved have been
described, and the results are discussed in
the light of their probable implications.
