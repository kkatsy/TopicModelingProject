Risk of Mortality Following Widowhood:
Age and Sex Differences by Mode of Death

ABSTRACT: This study examines how spouses’ deaths from sudden or lengthy illnesses differentially affect the mortality risks of surviving widows and widowers by age. Using the Panel
Study of Income Dynamics, we find the mortality risk differs by gender, age, and type of
widowhood. For nonelderly ( < 65) widowers, there is an elevated risk when their wives died
suddenly. For older (=65) widows, the mortality risk is lower than that of comparably aged
married women when their husbands died after a long-term illness. These gender, age, and
mode-of-death differences are consistent with role theory and theories of social support.

A consistently reported health consequence of widowhood is an increased
risk of mortality among surviving
spouses. Considerable speculation regarding the reason for this elevated
risk of mortality exists. Some suggest
that bereavement raises the risk of
mortality (Stroebe et al., 1981; Stroebe
and Stroebe, 1993). Others hypothesize that major role changes following
the death of a spouse may trigger diseases that lead to premature death
(Bowling, 1987). Sanders (1983) speculates that the stress of caring for a terminally ill spouse may cause the caregiver spouse to ignore his/her own
health. Finally, Smith and Zick (1994)
argue that some spouses may share
lifestyles (e.g., smoking, drinking, living in poverty) that simultaneously diminish the longevity of both partners.

One dimension of the widowhood
experience that may link all of the
above perspectives is mode of death:
Did the first spouse die suddenly or
after a lengthy illness? Mode of death
may affect the couple’s shared lifestyle

(e.g., spending down into poverty to
meet the rising health care costs of
a spouse with a chronic illness), the
soon-to-be widowed spouse’s caregiving responsibilities, the pace at
which the surviving spouse must prepare for new roles, and his/her grieving
process. As such, mode of death may
be a key familial factor in explaining
widows’ and widowers’ elevated risk of
mortality.

The purpose of this study is to examine how widowers and widows differ
from their married counterparts in
their mortality risks depending upon
the mode of death leading to the widowhood event. This analysis focuses on
widowhood events that result from
deaths caused by long-term illnesses
versus widowhood events that result
from deaths that occur unexpectedly.
In this study, particular attention is
given to how mode of death affects the
relative risk of mortality by gender and
age after controlling for a number of
individual-specific socioeconomic and
demographic risk factors.

LITERATURE REVIEW
THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES

Four different theoretical models
can be used to generate hypotheses regarding the impact of type of widowhood (i.e., sudden or anticipated) on
the surviving spouse’s risk of mortality
and why type of widowhood effects
might vary with gender and age of
widowhood. Each of these models and
the hypotheses they generate are described briefly. The hypotheses associated with each model are summarized
in Table 1.

1. Psychiatric Models.—Why should
the nature of the first spouse’s death
affect the survivor’s health? Stroebe
and Stroebe (1987; 1993) appeal to several psychiatric models to answer this
question. First, drawing on theories of
depression, they note that positive reinforcement and social support formerly provided by the decedent are
quickly removed in the case of an unexpected death. More time is available
to the survivor to compensate for these
losses when the fatal illness develops
slowly. Second, psychoanalytic theory
suggests that guilt experienced by survivors following the unexpected death
of a spouse cannot be addressed since
the survivor does not have sufficient
opportunity to make restitutions. And
third, proponents of the learned helplessness perspective predict that deaths
that occur suddenly leave the survivor
with a severe sense of helplessness
since the perception was that nothing
could have been done to prevent the
death. Taken altogether, these psychiatric models generate the hypothesis
that sudden, unexpected deaths should
be more likely to precipitate elevated
risks of morbidity and mortality among

 

 

Social Biology

the surviving spouses than are expected deaths.

2. Role Theory.—Role theory predicts that sudden deaths should increase the surviving spouse’s risk of
mortality when compared to deaths after a prolonged illness. In addition, it
provides a rationale for why the effects
of sudden deaths may vary by gender
and age (Bowling, 1987; Osterweis et
al., 1984). For recent widowers, the
husband’s dependence on his wife for
daily home production activities may
leave him ill-equipped to assume these
responsibilities himself. While he may
attempt to take them on himself, he
may also purchase such services, call
on his children, if possible, to help out,
or remarry. In any event, he 1s unlikely
to replace completely the skills possessed by his former wife especially
when her death occurs suddenly. This
effect is predicted to be strongest when
the widower is older and the loss of
her household work activities would
be likely to exacerbate his alreadydeclining health.

In contrast, widows are less likely
than widowers to lose access to the
daily household production activities
(for which they generally take responsibility), but they are more likely to
lose substantial amounts of income
that had been provided by their deceased spouses (Burkhauser, 1990;
Smith and Zick, 1986). It is hypothesized that with a sudden illness, a
widow is less able to adjust her incomegenerating potential and as a consequence her economic status will often
decline, placing her health in greater
jeopardy. This relationship is likely
to be strongest when the woman is
widowed at a younger age, when she

3. Social Support Theory. —Informal social support has been shown repeatedly to affect numerous aspects of
health (House et al., 1988; Litwak and
Messeri, 1989). In the context of mortality following widowhood, it is hypothesized that married individuals
who die unexpectedly place their surviving spouses in greater jeopardy because there would be too little time to
marshall existing sources of social support. This finding may be especially
true for widowers who have relied on

their wives to maintain social ties with
family and friends. In the context of
this framework, elderly widowers are
hypothesized to be particularly vulnerable because of their long-standing inability or lack of experience in seeking
emotional support outside of the marriage in a time of crisis.

4. Caregiver Burden.—Research on
caregiver burden provides a contrasting hypothesis regarding mortality
following widowhood. Proponents of
this framework suggest that widowed
individuals whose spouses have died
after an extended period of illness
should be most likely to experience elevated risks of mortality. Since women
are more likely than men to take on
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

62 Smith and Zick

such caregiving responsibilities, it is
predicted that caregiver burden will
raise widows’ risk of mortality more
than widowers’. Furthermore, if
younger surviving spouses must tend to
the needs of their chronically ill partners while also meeting other responsibilities (e.g., market work), then they
may suffer the strains of doing too
much. This responsibility may lead
younger survivors to overlook their
own well-being to the point of increasing their own risk of morbidity and
mortality (Zarit et al., 1986). It has
also been suggested that longer-term
illnesses may increase attachment to
the dying spouse thereby enhancing
the grief experienced by the caregiver
(Vachon et al., 1982).

PAST RESEARCH FINDINGS

1. Post-Widowhood Mortality Studtes. — While no study has examined the
relationship between mode of death
and the surviving spouse’s risk of mortality, many studies have examined the
impact of widowhood more generally
on the surviving spouse’s risk of mortality. These studies, reviewed in detail
in Stroebe and Stroebe (1993), vary in
their sample frames, time periods, and
lengths of follow-up. Yet, the majority
find excess mortality among the widowed when compared to otherwise
similar married individuals. They also
report evidence of gender differences
(Bowling and Charlton, 1987; Helsing
et al., 1982; Jones, 1987, 1988; Kaprio
et al., 1987; Zick and Smith, 1991) and
age differences (Bowling and Charlton, 1987; Helsing and Szklo, 1981;
Helsing et al., 1982; Helsing et al.,
1981; Jones, 1987, 1988).

2. Post-Widowhood Morbidity Studies. —Numerous studies have investi
Social Biology

gated the effects of expected and unexpected deaths on the survivors’
psychological and physical morbidity,
but the research findings from these
latter studies have been equivocal.
Clayton et al. (1973) found little difference in psychiatric symptoms between survivors of unexpected and
expected deaths twelve to eighteen
months following widowhood. Sanders
(1983), however, reported that those
with medium preparation time for the
spouse’s death appear slightly better
off. In support of the idea that sudden
deaths are worse for the surviving
spouses, Parkes and Weiss (1983),
Lundin (1984a, 19845), and Ball (1977)
found that psychiatric morbidity is
elevated most for surviving spouses
with little warning. In contrast, Gerber
et al., (1975) reported that doctor office visits, feeling ill, and the use of psychotropic medications were greatest
among surviving spouses who endured
their spouses’ long-term illnesses.
Inconsistency in the results of these
widowhood morbidity studies suggest
that the effects of caregiving may dominate in some instances whereas loss of
social support, roles, and psychiatric
considerations may dominate in other
circumstances. In addition, some of the
variation in the results may be related
to differences in samples, research designs, length of follow-up, method of
measuring the forewarning of death,
and the timing of the interviews relative to the widowhood event. A common deficiency in many of these investigations is that the studies did not (or
could not) control for other basic socioeconomic and demographic factors
that have been found to affect both
widowhood and health (e.g., employment status, income, education) (Du

leep, 1986; Feldman et al., 1989; Verbrugge, 1983; Wingard, 1984; Zick and
Smith, 1991). .

In addition, in most of these analyses, the survivors were contacted only
after the widowhood event. It is unclear whether pre-widowhood levels
of morbidity account for some of
the post-widowhood differences, when
they were observed. Asking a surviving
spouse to recall his/her health prior
to the widowhood also poses problems
of measurement and recall bias. Also,
the initial samples selected may be
biased to the extent that survivors
whose health worsened or who died
soon after the widowhood event (i.e.,
the most severely affected), were not
included in such post-widowhood surveys.

Finally, these studies use a variety
of categorization schemes to classify
unexpected and expected widowhood
events. At one extreme, Lundin
(1984a, 19845) classifies an unexpected
death as one that occurred within two
hours of falling ill. In contrast, Gerber
et al. (1975) use a scheme where an unexpected death is defined to be one
where the onset occurred less than two
months prior to the death. Such differences in classification may also affect
the conclusions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The current. analyses are based on
incident cases of widowhood and a
comparison group of married couples
identified in the 1984 release of the
Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID). Since 1968, the Survey Research Center at the University of
Michigan has collected socioeconomic
and demographic data annually from

Risk of Mortality 63

the same 5,000 U.S. families that comprise the PSID (Survey Research Center, 1989). The PSID includes an oversampling of poor households. To
account for this oversampling, results
for age-sex-specific death rates reported below have been adjusted
by the use of appropriate sampling
weights to produce statistics that are
nationally representative of the U.S.
widowed population. The weights used
are generated by the University of
Michigan’s Survey Research Center,
and they correct for the oversampling
of poor households and any systematic
sample attrition that has occurred over
the years in the panel (Survey Research Center, 1989). While the PSID
data are based on a panel, it was not
possible to construct weights derived
from a single calendar year appropriate
for all respondents because spouse
deaths occurred over a wide range of
years. Accordingly, sampling weights
for all widowed persons were constructed by using their year-specific
PSID sample weights (the weights
change annually) from the year prior to
their spouses’ death. Applying these
weights then allows us to generalize
our findings to the mortality experiences of widowed individuals in the
United States during the 1970’s and
early 1980’s.

All Cox proportional hazards regressions (described below) are estimated without applying PSID sampling weights. Instead, variables that
form the basis for the nonsimple random sampling design of the PSID (poverty status primarily) are taken into account by including them as covariates
(DuMouchel and Duncan, 1983).

The PSID offers several advantages
over other data sets that might be used

64 Smith and Zick

for the current investigation. The primary advantage is that death certificate
information has been matched to panel
member records for over 80 per cent
of the decedents in the PSID. Such
information can be used to make an informed decision as to whether or not a
death was sudden or expected. Another advantage of the PSID is that it
contains extensive socioeconomic and
demographic information including
continuous age, difference in age between husband and wife, urbanicity,
recent spells of poverty, labor force
participation, education, whether or
not other household members lived
with the couple, and race. These variables will be included in the estimating
equations so that we might remove
their possible confounding effects.
Widows and widowers used for this
study are selected based on three criteria: (1) the widowed individuals were
age 25 or older at the time of widowhood; (2) any related adult surviving
the decedent (nearly always the surviving spouse) had to be interviewed the
year after the widowhood; and (3) the
individuals became widowed between
1971 and 1982. While the PSID began
in 1968, the sample is restricted to
those who were widowed between 1971
and 1982 in order to obtain at least
three years of prewidowhood information about the to-be-widowed household. It is also necessary to have at
least one year of follow-up information
after the year of widowhood in order to
determine whether the widowed individual died or not and to obtain some
post-widowhood information. For
most widowed households in the PSID,
the surviving spouse would be contacted and the deceased spouse’s death
would be recorded as having occurred

 

Social Biology

sometime during the previous year.
When both a widowhood and survivor’s death occurred within a year’s
time, other family members reported
that the deaths had occurred. Given
the long-standing involvement of the
study families, this method of ascertaining information on spouses’ deaths
that occurred less than a year apart
proved successful.

With these restrictions, there are
141 widowers and 351 widows identified in the PSID. These counts are
somewhat small and as a consequence,
the analyses based on these data are
suggestive. Nonetheless, the lengthy
followup period and the prospective
sample design for a nationally representative sample of married and widowed persons strengthen the power of
the analysis.

A sample of 1,782 married couples
who were married from 1968 to 1970
serves as an unexposed comparison
group. The mortality experiences of
these married men and women are
compared to the widow and widower
samples. A married individual is observed until he/she leaves the study by
his/her own death, the death of his/her
spouse, refusal or loss to follow-up for
some other reason. Couples who separated or divorced during the study are
not included in the analyses.

Death certificate information is
used to determine whether a spouse
died following a long-term illness or
suddenly. Death certificates for 80 per
cent of the deceased wives and 84 per
cent of the deceased husbands are usable. All listed causes of death recorded on the death certificate are used
to characterize the nature of the death
leading to the widowhood. The advantages of using multiple cause-of-death

Vol. 43, No. 1-2

information has been described by others (Israel, et al., 1986). Duration of
the disease leading to the death as described on the death certificate was
also considered when it was available
and unambiguous. All death certificate
coding has been done by a physician
who had extensive prior experience in
interpreting death certificate data.

Widowed individuals are divided
into three groups: unexpected, expected, and unknown. “Unexpected”
widowed individuals had spouses who
died within six months of the onset
of the condition(s) that led to their
deaths. Deaths in this group include,
but are not limited to, suicides where
no other conditions are listed on the
death certificate, automobile accidents
with no other chronic conditions
noted, and myocardial infarctions (MI)
where the decedent had no prior
chronic conditions reported on the
death certificate. Spouse deaths are
classified as ““expected”’ when they had
medical conditions that began more
than six months prior to their deaths.
These deaths were typically the result
of various forms of cancer, ischemic
heart disease, and cerebrovascular
disease. Deaths from MI’s that are accompanied by associated or contributing causes of death from atherosclerotic heart disease, cerebrovascular
disease, diabetes mellitus, or previous
MI’s are also treated as expected
deaths. The use of a six-month threshold in this classification scheme was
decided upon based on past research
(Clayton et al., 1973; Gerber et al.,
1975) and in consultation with nosologists and physicians.

Individuals are included in the “unknown” category if they had spouses
whose death certificates either contain

Risk of Mortality 65

too little information or ambiguous information about the length of their
medical condition, or whose death certificates could not be matched confidently to the PSID.

Table 2 summarizes the sample
sizes, person-years, number of deaths,
and death rates (deaths + personyears) in the PSID by age and gender.
Person-years are reported because
they provide descriptive background
information about the total number of
years surviving spouses were at-risk of
their own deaths, information that is
used in estimating the mortality rates
on which the proportional hazards regression models are based. Personyears for an individual are calculated
by adding the number of years s/he
lived after widowhood up to death or
the end of the study. For example,
person-year data help to distinguish
between two samples of 10 widows
each where all widows die, except that
for the first sample they all die one year
after widowhood and for the second
sample they all die 10 years after widowhood. In the first sample, 10 deaths
occurred during 10 person-years
(10 X 1 year of survival) while in the
second sample, the same number of
deaths occurred in 100 person-years
(10 X 10 years of survival). The second
sample has a much lower death rate (10
deaths/100 person-years = 0.10) than
the first sample (10 deaths/10 personyears = 1.00).

In Table 2, note that the 351 deaths
among married men produced the
351 widows. Simultaneously, the 141
deaths among the married women
yielded 141 widowers.

Mortality patterns are compared between married individuals and each of
the three widowed groups by age and

sex so that we might test the competing
hypotheses generated by the alternative theoretical models. The age comparisons are between those aged 2564, and =65.

Tables 3 and 4 list the estimated rate
ratios (RR) for all-cause mortality
based on Cox proportional hazards
regression models (Allison, 1984) for
men and women, respectively. Our interest in this study is to test whether the
mortality rate among surviving spouses
varies by the type of death experienced
by the deceased spouse. It is therefore
appropriate to use the Cox proportional hazards regression model because it explicitly treats the mortality
(or more generally, the hazard) rate as
the dependent variable, it allows the
mortality rate to be a function of numerous independent variables, and it
uses all available survival information
about widowed persons who died as
well as those who did not die during the
study period (i.e., records that were
right-censored). This model also does
not require that one specify the distribution of the mortality rate a priori.

These fully-adjusted estimates control for the possible socioeconomic and
demographic confounders noted earlier. While figures are presented for all
three groups, there are no hypotheses
concerning the “unknown” group.
Thus, while their rate ratios are presented for completeness, they will not
be the focus of the discussion.

Nonelderly (25-64 years old) widowers have the highest risk of mortality
when their wives die suddenly. The
risk is greatest for the younger (25-49)
widowers and somewhat lower but still
substantial for middle-aged (50-64)
widowers (not shown in Table 3; see
Table 2 for sex-specific death rates for

Risk of Mortality 67

men 25-49 and 50-64). This risk diminishes substantially for older widowers. While the risk of mortality declines
with age for unexpected widowers, the
risk tends to rise for expected widowers although the relative risks are all
below unity. In the elderly group, it
appears that both types of widowers
experience an advantage over their
married counterparts although these
differences are not statistically significant.

In general, the relative risks are
lower for widows than for widowers.
Nonelderly (25-64) widows whose
spouses died after a chronic illness experience a suggestive elevated mortality risk. For the elderly group, the figures swing in favor of the widows with
both unexpected and expected widows
experiencing lower mortality risks than
their married counterparts. And in the
latter case, the relative risk is statistically significant (p < 0.05).

DISCUSSION AND
CONCLUSIONS

The current analyses offer several
advantages over past widowhood mortality studies. First, socioeconomic and
demographic characteristics measured
immediately before (e.g., poverty, employment) and after (e.g., remarriage)
widowhood are controlled for here.
Second, the data are nationally representative, and they include a wide
range of ages for both widows and widowers. Many previous studies have examined only one sex or they have imposed age restrictions on samples that
are often from select geographic areas.
Third, the PSID offers a long follow-up
period during which deaths as well as

the linking of death certificate data to
the PSID contributed key information
about the nature of the spouses’ deaths

the underlying cause of death, age at

a careful review of all the information
on the certificates used in concert with
data collected from the PSID is viewed
as an improvement in the method for
classifying deaths as sudden or expected. The major limitation of this
analysis is the sample size. With such a
small sample, the reader should view
the conclusions that follow as suggestive rather than definitive.

The empirical evidence from the
widowers is somewhat consistent with
the hypotheses generated by the social
support and role theories. That is, widowers experience an elevated risk of
mortality when their wives’ deaths occur suddenly (rather than after a prolonged illness). But, the data do not
support the hypothesis that older widowers would be at greater risk than
nonelderly widowers.

The finding that widowers have
higher rates of mortality than married
men is consistent with previous prospective cohort studies (Parkes et al.,
1969; Mellstrom et al., 1982; Kaprio
et al., 1987; Helsing and Szklo, 1981).
While several of these previous studies
also found that younger widowers have
higher rates of mortality, it was not
known whether it was the impact of
simply losing a wife early in the life
span (regardless of the length of forewarning) or whether it was the mode of
death that was underlying this effect.
The present findings suggest that the
increased risk is due primarily to
deaths that occur without warning. It
may be that younger widowers, who
suddenly have to adapt to multiple
roles (e.g., father, mother, housekeeper, and breadwinner) with the
critical link in their social support network (i.e., their wives) now gone, have
the most difficulty adjusting.

In contrast to the widowers, there is
no statistically significant elevated risk
of mortality among nonelderly widows
and the older widows actually enjoy a
significant reduction in the risk of mortality 1f their husbands died after an extended illness. Perhaps these older
women have had time to prepare emotionally for the loss of their spouse. In
addition, after the death there is little

Risk of Mortality 69

need to adapt to new roles (i.e., after
age 65, children are almost always
gone from the house and both spouses
are usually retired from the labor
force), and social support networks are
often still in place. Taken altogether,
the results for the widows provide no
evidence in support of the caregiver
burden hypothesis but they do provide
some indirect support for the role theory, social support, and psychiatric
hypotheses.

The fact that the results differ for
widows and widowers suggests that the
behavioral mechanisms underlying
their risks of mortality may be different. While we speculated above on
what some of those differences might
be, larger panels that include data on
variables such as amount of and length
of caregiving, social support networks
and work and family roles, are needed
if more definitive tests of these hypotheses are to be made.

We also found that regardless of the
mode of death, older widows and widowers have lower mortality rates than
their married counterparts. Lower or
similar mortality rates among older
widows have been reported previously
(Helsing and Szklo, 1981; Kaprio et
al., 1987). This observed relationship is
likely to be the result of at least three
factors. First, with increasing age,
emotional changes associated with
widowhood that might affect the survivor’s health are more likely to be anticipated and therefore the mortality
consequences due exclusively to widowhood are reduced. Second, marriage affords health protection to its
members to the extent the illness is
amenable to informal intervention.
That is, a spouse may provide discernible health benefits for some conditions

(e.g., alcohol-related deaths, suicides)
but not for others (e.g., pancreatic cancer) (Gove, 1973; Litwak and Messer,
1989). Therefore, older married individuals may be at greater risk of diseases that are not as sensitive to the
benefits of marriage. Third, older,
married individuals may be the more
hardy members of their cohort by
virtue of the fact that they survived to
age 65 +. This could mean that stressful
life events such as the death of a spouse
may have smaller relative health effects on these “hardy” survivors.

The findings reported here raise a
couple of important conceptual and
intervention issues that merit future
research. First, differences in the way
unexpected and expected widowhood
events are measured may account for
the divergent findings in health studies
of bereavement. Fulton and Gottesman (1980) draw attention to the conceptual distinction between “‘anticipatory grief” and “‘forewarning of loss”
and argue that knowing that a spouse’s
illness is terminal does not necessarily
describe how the survivor will react
to the news. Vachon et al. (1977) reported that many widows of cancer
patients did not acknowledge the news
of their husbands’ cancer even though
they were explicitly told by a physician.
Further work is therefore needed to
understand fully the complex relationship between the type of death, the
length of forewarning, and individual

reactions to impending widowhood.
Moreover, interventions designed to
reduce excess mortality among the
younger widowed need to consider
the mechanisms that produce the diverse responses by gender following
unexpected and expected widowhood
events.

Second, the proposition that role
theory and social support systems may
explain the lower mortality risks of
older widows needs to be tested further. For example, more research is
needed to identify the range of strategies used by spouses to care for their
terminally ill partners and the extent to
which individual wives draw on their
social support networks to see them
through this stressful time. It would
also be important to know how variations in social roles affect the mortality
risks experienced by the surviving
spouse.
