Correlates of Voluntary
Childlessness in a Select
Population*

For several decades, social scientists and
demographers interested in population
processes have focused research efforts on
the formation of attitudes toward childbearing. Many variables, including race,
religious preference, social class, and social
mobility have been found to be instrumental in the formation of these attitudes
and in the subsequent fertility experienced
by the couples. However, little data can be
found on what factors predispose a couple
to negative fertility attitudes, that is, to
desire to have no children.

The lack of attention given to the
voluntarily childless couple, and indeed to
the childless couple in general, probably
stems from several factors. Firstly, the
phenomenon of childlessness, whether
voluntary or involuntary, is increasingly
rare. Table 1 shows the percent of evermarried women who were childless at
selected ages and dates from 1940 to 1967.
The total age group, as well as selected age
categories within the total group, have experienced steady declines in childlessness.
But to assume that this trend will continue

meetings Southwestern Sociological Association,

may be an error. With increasingly effective
means of contraception available, with
abortion laws undergoing examination and
change, and with increasing concern with,
and publicity over, growing population,
this trend may very well reverse itself.

Secondly, the neglect of the voluntarily
childless couple may be a result of the
tendency to view childlessness as just
another quantitative state of parity. It
would seem that there are important
qualitative differences associated with
childless and childed states, since those
who are presently childless are in violation
of the statistical and social norm to have
children.

Finally, were the above problems to be
ignored or deemed not prohibitive, the
design of a systematic study of voluntarily
childless couples is a formidable task.
Where would such couples be found? How
could the researcher be sure that the
childlessness was voluntary?

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In an attempt to bridge this research
hiatus and to begin to cope with the difficult problems of sampling, this paper
deals with the seventy-two childless

couples who during the last two years
applied to the Association for Voluntary
Sterilization (AVS) for help in obtaining
surgical sterilizations. Such couples, of
course, are not representative of the total
population of voluntary childless couples
in the country. It might be maintained
that these couples are more dedicated to
the idea of remaining childless than other
couples might be, since they are willing to
take this frequently irreversible step.

Undoubtedly there are couples who
have had such operations for the purpose
of preventing conception without the aid
of AVS. But the couples who come to
AVS are sometimes from communities
where it is difficult to obtain such operations. As one applicant stated rather bitterly: “I have tried to obtain a vasectomy
locally but Puritanism is still strong in this
part of the country and no consideration
whatsoever is given to private individual
judgments and wishes.” If this is often the
case, these couples may be the most flagrant norm violators of all.

They are described here, then, not as a
representative or probability sample of all
voluntarily childless couples. Instead they
constitute an availability sample. In fact,
they might best be treated as a separate
population since there is little basis for
estimating the degree to which even gross
demographic characteristics of the national

population of voluntarily childless couples
are represented by these seventy-two
couples. Nevertheless, it is hoped that detailed description of their characteristics
will provide theoretical and research leads
for further investigations of negative fertility attitudes.

DATA AND RESULTS

Table 2 gives preliminary descriptive
data on the applicants to AVS. The vast
majority of these applicants are males,
presumably since a vasectomy is a simpler
operation than a tubal ligation would be.
Most of them come from the northeastern
region of the United States. Table 2 also
shows that most of these couples come
from large urban areas. Indeed, while 12%
of them seem to come from very small
communities this is probably an overstatement of the numbers actually from isolated
small communities since some of the small
places included in that category are in
fact suburbs of very large metropolitan
areas.

The mean number of years these couples
have been married is 5.2, but half of them
have been married for Jess than four years
and two-thirds have been married for less
than six years before applying to AVS for
assistance. Finally, most of the couples
heard about AVS through some form of
mass media, including radio or TV, maga

zines, and newspapers. While most of the
applicants for the actual operations were
males, the magazines most frequently
mentioned as sources of information about
AVS, were McCalls, Redbook, and other
magazines traditionally thought of as
women’s publications.

Table 3 shows the age, religion, and
socioeconomic status of both husbands and
wives, as measured by their occupation,
education, and income. Also shown are
comparable data for the United States
population at selected dates. This enables

Voluntary Childlessness

 

279

some comparison of these voluntarily
childless couples with the general population on at least four of these characteristics.

The mean age of husbands in this sample
is 32 and of wives 29—the traditional
three-year difference in age found in most
populations. Over 50% of both husbands
and wives are less than 30. The decision
to be sterilized in order to prevent conception is apparently an early one. However, 17% of the husbands and 10% of
the wives are over 40, so that this decision
is not exclusively confined to extremely
young couples by any means.

Perhaps the most theoretically interesting finding concerning the characteristics
of these couples is the disproportionate
number among them who have no religion
whatever. Forty per cent of the husbands
and 36% of the wives fall into this category, as opposed to 4% and 1% of USS.
males and females respectively. Catholics
are under-represented among these couples
in comparison with their proportion in the
population, as might be expected given
the prohibition against birth control and
the value placed on children in this religion. But other religious groups are also
under-represented among the childless
couples, with two exceptions. Jewish men,
who comprise 11% of the childless husbands, constitute only 4% of the general
population. Secondly, both sexes in the
“Other Protestant” category are somewhat
over-represented among the 72 couples
when compared to national proportions.

By any of the three measures of socioeconomic status shown in Table 3 these
childless couples are clearly of higher
status than the United States population
in general. The occupational score used
here is a measure computed by using
standardized scores of income and education associated with each occupation in the
United States. If we compare the husbands

of the childless couples to the heads of
U.S. families in 1960 (a not entirely comparable group) it can be seen that the
childless husbands are much more likely
to be in the highest status occupations

The educational attainment comparison
is even more striking. Fully 62% of the

population could claim such an educational attainment in 1960. It is only fair to
point out, however, that since the childless
couples are largely below 30, their educational attainment is likely to be higher
than that for the entire U.S. population.
Table 3 also gives the educational attainment distribution for males and females
age 25-34 years in the United States in
1960. Still, the voluntarily childless couples
show a much higher educational attainment.

The distribution of income follows this
same pattern. The mean income of the
childless husbands is $8,860 while that
same figure for U.S. males in 1967 was
$6,159. Similarly with females there is
nearly a $2,000 differential in the income
of these childless wives and U.S. females
in 1967.

Table 4 gives the contraceptive and
pregnancy histories of these couples. The
great majority of them (89%) were contracepting at the time they requested
sterilization and had been doing so for a
number of years. Eight per cent had used
some form of contraception previously but
were not now doing so. Three per cent of
them had never contracepted.

Since most of the couples mentioned using various methods of contraception, the
percentages in this column do not add to
100 and multiple responses are included.

* The percentages here do not add to 100 since several
couples mentioned using several different methods.

Oral contraceptives were by far the most
frequent method of contraception used.
Condoms and diaphragms were less frequently used by these couples, and other
methods shown in Table 4 were not often
mentioned.

The mean number of years these couples
had been contracepting, by whatever
method, is 4.3. The largest group of them
had contracepted for five or more years,
with one couple reporting they had been
practicing birth control for 18 years. Apparently the decision to be sterilized is
not often a quick one made in reaction to
the inconvenience of contracepting. A disappointingly large percentage of these
couples did not report these data, most
probably due to the actual wording of the
question, which asked them to specify

282

when they began using contraceptives. It
could be that they could not remember or
that they did not feel these data were
relevant to AVS.

Finally, Table 4 gives the pregnancy
history of these couples. Apparently 71%
of them have never been pregnant, since
they are presently childless and have had
neither miscarriages nor abortions. Another
option exists—to bear a child and then
give it up by adoption—and these data
would not show how many couples have
done so. Six per cent of the couples have
had abortions, and 9% have had miscarriages, which may or may not have been
deliberately inflicted.

Table 5 shows the reasons these couples
gave on their applications for wanting to

be sterilized. Unfortunately, 24% of the
applicants said simply that they did not
wish to have any children—-making them
unusable for an analysis which tries to tap
reasons for not wanting children. Table 5
gives both the first reason given by the
couples in making their application and

Gustavus and Henley

Social Biology

the total reasons mentioned by the couples.
The most common reason given by these
couples was some concern for the world or
national population problem. The theoretica] question this finding raises is whether
this is a true reason which motivates these
couples or whether this is a socially acceptable reason they have seized upon with
the advent of population propaganda in
order to justify a decision they have already made. These data do not provide
answers to questions of this sort.

Health reasons were also important in
leading to this decision to seek sterilization. Included here were heart conditions,
blood problems, or other physical conditions, particularly of the wives, which
would make childbearing difficult at best.
These are presumably conditions out of
the direct control of these couples and
might not qualify them as strictly voluntarily childless.

Several of the couples mentioned deep
or time-consuming involvement with careers which would make child rearing
inconvenient. Typical of this kind of comment, made by 17% of the sample, is the
following:

Before my wife and I were married seven

years ago, we both expressed our desires

to have no children, so that we could do

justice to our work, unhindered. I am a

writer. My wife is deeply involved in

sculpturing. We both have jobs and come
home at night to our hobbies.

Eleven per cent of the sample simply
stated that they were too old to begin
their families now. In some cases these
couples married late, but in others no reason is given for not starting the family at
an earlier age.

A plain dislike for children was given
as a reason for wanting to remain childless
by 12% of the sample. Typical of this
kind of response are the following:

Both of us are too familiar with the smell
of sour pablum, diaper pails, and baby

bP]

““b.m.’s” and we find equally nauseating the
sound of crying, screaming, and infant
temper tantrums. These so called “joys of
parenthood” are definitely not for us.

Or the couple who said:

We are unable to tolerate the presence of
children for any appreciable length of time
and cannot imagine any circumstances in
which either of us would ever want children
of our own.

Some of the couples mentioned economic
problems which they felt prohibited them
from having children. Examples of these
couples’ comments include:

We are unable to afford the expenses of
pregnancy, child birth, child raising and
subsequent family illnesses . . . . An accidental pregnancy now would keep us living
in cheap apartments for the rest of our
lives.

One of the wives wrote:

Another reason we do not want children
are our financial problems. My husband
never finished school, and his low paying
job doesn’t really meet our needs, with the
high cost of living. It pays the bills and
there is none left over for saving. There
is no real future in his job. .. . We live in
a one bedroom 8’ by 31’ housetrailer and
it’s really too crowded for the two of us.
It will be several years, if ever, before we
can hope to do better. A new car must
come first, as our 14 year old Chevrolet
won’t stand up much longer without falling
apart.

Other reasons given by fairly small
proportions of the sample include some
mention of a preferred style of life, other
than professional ambitions, which would
be inhibited by children. Included here
are couples who intend to travel or who
enjoy solitude for its own sake. World
conditions, other than overpopulation,
were mentioned by 7% of this group.
These respondents were concerned about
war, pollution, crime, etc., and did not feel
such a world was a good place to bring
up children. Finally, nine of the couples
intend to adopt children, which, of course,

Voluntary Childlessness

283

does not make them voluntarily childless
at all.

Included in the category labeled “Other”
reasons were a smattering of couples who
were mentally retarded, who thought such
an operation would improve their sexual
life, or who said only that they were
frankly untrusting of the birth-control
methods available to them, for health or
effectiveness reasons.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

This has indeed been a cursory look at
a select population of couples who, with
the exception of nine potential adopters,
intend to be permanently childless. With
such limited data and given such a population, the most we can hope to do is pick
up a few leads as to what sorts of characteristics persons with negative fertility attitudes are likely to have and what they
perceive as some of the reasons behind this
attitude. Our data show that an average
couple in this group is likely to be living
in a large metropolitan area and to have
been married an average of about five
years. They are likely to be about thirty
years of age, to say they have no religion,
and to be of generally high socioeconomic
status. Most all of them have used some
method of birth control, usually the pill,
have been contracepting for a number of
years, and are not likely to have had a
miscarriage or abortion. Such a profile of
the average person in our sample, of
course, obscures as much as it enlightens.

Finally, in looking at the reasons for
wanting to remain childless, population
concerns and health considerations are the
two most mentioned reasons and if truly a
reflection of the couple’s rationale are not
“selfish” reasons which may be ascribed to
childless couples by society in general.
Reasons which might be more reasonably
associated with hedonism include career
commitments, style of life, or economic

284

desires. Disliking children and fear of pregnancy might be classified as “hang-ups”
which may or may not be associated with
selfish pursuits.

In future research on the voluntarily
childless couple, the strategy that might
be taken in locating these couples is not
clearly indicated by these data. It is clear
from the small percentage of the population which they comprise that random
samples of the population, unless quite
large, are not likely to unearth sufficient
numbers of them to do detailed tabulations. An availability sampling technique
might be tried in large communities—with
no hope of representativeness. These authors tried, prior to receiving these data
from AVS, to search out such couples in
several ways, including surveying couples
in apartments known to be one-bedroom
or smaller where the presence of children
was unlikely. This method of course turns
up mostly couples who are postponing their
childbearing, a few single people, and
several pregnant wives. Further, even

Gustavus and Henley

Social Biology

among the couples found who claim to be
permanently and voluntarily childless,
some of them will no doubt experience an
accidental pregnancy in the future and
keep the child. It is possible to place ads
in various newspapers and other community publication asking childless couples to
volunteer to answer a questionnaire. Such
a method is plagued by the usual problems associated with using volunteers in
any research.

Nevertheless, these two methods in concert, used over a period of time in a large
community, might yield another select
population like the one discussed here.
Certainly any additional data would be
useful, since as mentioned above, the
literature on these special couples with
negative fertility attitudes is so sparse.
