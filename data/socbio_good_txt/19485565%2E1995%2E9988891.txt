Effects of Lactation and Contraceptive Use

on Birth-spacing in Bolivia

ABSTRACT: Based on the 1989 Demographic and Health Survey of Bolivia, analysis of the joint
effects of breastfeeding and contraceptive use on birth-spacing showed the IUD to be the most
effective contraceptive method used to delay conception. Breastfeeding significantly lengthened
the birth interval, but only following second and higher parity births. In addition, conditions of
poverty appeared to further inhibit the return of fecundity and delay conception.

The goal of many policy makers
and family planners is to improve the
health of women and children by
eliminating unwanted pregnancies and
lengthening the birth interval through
the adoption of contraception. Breastfeeding, however, can also influence
these patterns, as can other maternal
characteristics. Both lactation and contraceptive practices, therefore, need to
be examined simultaneously in order
to evaluate their influence on birthspacing.

In this study, I examine factors influencing the spacing of births in Bolivia, one of the most impoverished nations of Latin America. I model the
joint effects of breastfeeding and contraceptive use on birth-spacing for a
sample of women giving birth between
1984 and 1989.

BACKGROUND

Lactation and contraceptive use are
both proximate determinants of fertility, that is, they directly affect fertility
and are the mechanisms through which
other social and cultural factors oper
ate (Bongaarts and Potter, 1983). At
the individual level, frequent and intense breastfeeding after giving birth
reduces a woman’s exposure to conception by lengthening the period of
postpartum amenorrhea. In addition,
the use of contraception further reduces the likelihood of another conception.

Breastfeeding, by stimulating high
prolactin levels, prolongs anovulation
and the period of postpartum amenorrhea (Jain et al., 1970; Habicht et al.,
1984; Gray, 1981). Over time, however, the contraceptive effect diminishes (Jain et al., 1970; Gray, 1981). In
general, the duration of infecundity
due to lactation does not appear to be
extendable much beyond two years
(Bracher and Santow, 1982).

The influence of lactation on the
duration of postpartum amenorrhea
depends on various other factors, making the relationship between lactation
and fertility difficult to define. Previous
studies indicate that the inhibiting effect of lactation on fertility is greatest
when modern contraceptive use is low,
lactation is unsupplemented, and the

nutritional status of the mother is low

(Van Landingham et al., 1991; Santow,
1987; Huffman, 1987; Ramachandran,
1987; Fink et al., 1992; Hull, 1987).

Past research has also found con
traceptive use to be negatively related
to breastfeeding, and this negative
relationship is not well understood
(Millman, 1985; National Research
Council, 1989). Some argue that both
breastfeeding reduction and contrawceptive use are, in part, brought on
S by development and lifestyle changes
as women adapt to employment out‘eside of the home. Previous research
© has found urbanization and increased

A education (indicators of development)
S to be associated with declines in tra$ ditional breastfeeding practices and
“increases in modern contraceptive
ss use (Cochrane, 1979; Ramachandran,
‘Ss 1987; Westoff et al., 1989; Da Vanzo
~and Starbird, 1991).

In Bolivia, development is limited.
ent majority of the population are
© rural farmers, and education levels,
‘Zespecially for women, are low. In
5 1988, the majority of childbearing-age
5 women had completed less than eight
>years of schooling (Instituto Nacional
— de Estadistica, 1989). Breastfeeding is
3g 8 almost universally practiced, and modSem contraceptive use is rare. There is,
§ however, some evidence to suggest
A that, at least in urban centers, the ma
jority of women desire to limit their
family size and want access to modern
contraception (Roosta, 1989). Other
studies of Bolivian women have found
that breastfeeding durations are declining in urban areas, in particular
among women from middle and high
income groups, women with higher education, women who work long hours,
and women who receive prenatal care
and information (Anaya, 1984).

Building upon this literature, and in
an effort to explore further these issues
in an impoverished setting, I address
the research question: How do breastfeeding and contraceptive use jointly
influence birth-spacing, an important
factor in child and maternal health?

In response to this question, I model
the simultaneous effects of lactation and contraceptive use on birthspacing. In addition, I include various
controls for family background and
birth characteristics. The relationships
between lactation, contraceptive use
and fertility are observed within a context of poverty as I focus on the lives of
women and children in Bolivia, one of
the poorest nations in Latin America.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
THE DATA

Data from the 1989 Demographic
and Health Survey of Bolivia are used
to examine breastfeeding practices,
contraceptive use, and birth-spacing.
The DHS provides a rich source of information on demographic processes
previously undocumented in Bolivia.
The Bolivian sample is of women aged
15 to 49 in 1989 and consists of 7 5923
completed interviews.

The DHS includes a birth history of
all live births of sampled women. More
in-depth information, including contraceptive use and breastfeeding information, is provided for live-births occurring during a five-year period prior
to the interview date. Because the information required by my objectives is
contained in the five-year histories,
women who bore children during this
period are the primary focus of the
analyses.

MODEL SPECIFICATIONS

I model the effects of lactation and
contraceptive use on birth-spacing as
shown in Figure 2. This fertility model
estimates the effects of a woman’s contraceptive use and lactation practices
following a birth on the likelihood of
her having another conception. In addition, controls for bio-demographic,
family background, and community
environmental factors are included in
the analyses.

The model analyzes the mother’s
experience translated into personmonths and focuses on the interval beginning with the birth of the index
child.! The event examined is the likelihood of a subsequent conception occurring following the birth of the index
child. The duration interval (dependent variable) is the period in months
from the birth of the index child (or
birth initiating the interval) to the conception date of the succeeding birth.
Cases are right-censored at the date of
interview if no subsequent conception
has occurred.?

1Due to the focus on birth-spacing, twins are excluded from the analyses. Just over 1 per cent of all
births in the survey were twins.

2For all of the analyses, only births occurring
during 1984 and 1989 are included. However, because the Total Fertility Rate in Bolivia is so high,
left-censoring was not found to be problematic.

The variables in the fertility model
and their operational definitions are
provided in Table 1. In order to control
for parity, the dependent variable—
the interval from birth of the index
child to a succeeding conception—is
analyzed separately by parity. The
following groups are examined: (1)
first birth to second conception, (2)
second birth to third conception, (3)
third birth to fourth conception, and
(4) fourth birth to fifth conception and
all higher order intervals.3

Using event-history techniques, the
fertility model is analyzed separately
for each of the birth intervals and assumes the form:

log A(t) = a(t) + bX + cY

where h(f) is a vector of birth intervals;
a(t) is a quadratic function of time; X
is a vector of lactation and contraceptive factors; Y is a vector of
bio-demographic, family background,
and community environmental controls; and b and ¢ are vectors to be estimated. I used survival table techniques to plot the hazard rate for each
dependent birth-interval grouping and
determined that a quadratic model be

3This last category simultaneously examines the
intervals from four births to fifth conceptions, fifth
births to sixth conceptions, and so forth, for all
higher parity intervals.

estimated. The event history analyses
are computed using the program CTM
(Continuous Time Models).

The main variables of interest are
lactation and contraceptive use. Lactation is a time-varying covariate that
indicates whether breastfeeding was
stopped or ever started. I expect the
stopping of lactation to shorten the period of anovulation and increase the
likelihood of a next conception. Measures of contraceptive use indicate the
type of contraceptive method used after the birth of the index child. And I
expect contraceptive use to decrease
the likelihood of a subsequent conception, depending on the effectiveness of
the method used.

Various controls for bio-demographic, family background, and community environmental factors are also
included in the model and defined in
Table 1. One important bio-demographic factor in regard to  birthspacing is a control for “‘replacement”’
behavior, which refers to compensating for the loss of an infant. A short
birth interval may be either the cause
or the result of a child death. Following
an infant death, breastfeeding generally ends, resulting in a short birth interval due to the early return of ovulation (Da Vanzo and Starbird, 1991).
In addition, if an infant dies, parents
may attempt to “replace” the death
with another birth, also resulting in a
short birth interval (Winikoff, 1987;
National Research Council, 1989). In
an effort to replace the lost child, parents may increase the frequency of intercourse and/or reduce contraceptive
use (Da Vanzo and Starbird, 1991).

In the model, the measures of contraceptive use indicate only the type of

Social Biology

contraceptive method used, not the
duration of use. Thus, the death of an
index child may measure shorter durations of contraceptive use and/or
increases in the frequency of intercourse —both proximate determinants
of fertility. Therefore, to control for
the occurrence of a prior death and
subsequent ‘“‘replacement”’ behaviors,
a time-varying covariate indicating
whether the index child died before
age two and prior to the conception of
the next child is included in the model.

Other bio-demographic factors included in the model are the gender of
the index child, and the age of the
mother at the index birth. In some cultures sex preferences translate into behaviors that either protect or place infants at risk. Sex preferences are not
dominant in Latin culture, therefore,
the effect of this factor is likely to be
weak. I expect age of mother at birth to
influence fertility negatively. Fecundity declines with age. Thus, the older
the mother at the birth of the index
child, the less likely a subsequent con- |
ception will follow.

Family background factors (defined
in Table 1), such as female education
and employment are likely to reduce
the probability of a following conception. I expect more highly educated
women (nine years of schooling or
more) and women who work full-time
for pay to have lower fertility than
women with little or no education and
women who work at home (Cochrane,
1979). Women with more education
generally desire relatively smaller families and have more reproductive
knowledge and access to contraception
than women with little or no education
(Lee and Bulato, 1983).
Vol. 42, No. 1-2

Partner’s education is used as a
proxy for socioeconomic status.* It is
likely that higher partner’s education
or socioeconomic status will decrease
the probability of a following conception. However, because it is a crude
measure, I expect its effect to be weak.
Again, women from higher economic
groups generally prefer smaller families and have access to better health

on the status of the first union at the

the Llanos region due to the large
concentration of indigenous groups in
the first two areas (see Table 1). In addition, because of development and
greater access to education and modern medical care, fertility is likely to be
lower in urban zones than in rural areas
(Roosta, 1989).

Ethnicity, indicated by the language
usually spoken at home, is important
because of the variations in fertility behaviors among the indigenous, mestizo, and white populations. Indigenous groups, compared to other ethnic
groups, have the highest fertility in Bolivia (Anaya, 1984). However, the
measure of language spoken in the
DHS does not isolate bilingual speakers from those who speak only one language; thus, many bilingual mestizos
are defined as Spanish speakers in the
DHS, although culturally they are
more like the indigenous population
(Alexander, 1982). This blurring of
the bilingual speakers with both the
Spanish and indigenous groups greatly
weakens this measure of ethnicity.

RESULTS

BREASTFEEDING PRACTICES AND
CONTRACEPTIVE USE

Most infants in Bolivia are breastfed
and durations of lactation are long,
with average weaning age being about
16 months (Anaya, 1984). Almost all
infants born between 1984 and 1989

>The Bolivian DHS measure of urbanization demarcates any center with a population of 2,500 or
more inhabitants as “urban.”’ Thus, it is not possible
to distinguish between residence in large metropolitan cites, such as La Paz, and small villages. The
effect of this variable, therefore, is likely to be
weak.

were breastfed—96 per cent. However, by the date of interview over
two-thirds of the infants had stopped
suckling. Modern contraceptive use in
Bolivia is very low; only about 12 per
cent of all married (formal and informal) Bolivian women were using modern contraceptive methods in 1989.

THE FERTILITY MODEL

In order to study the simultaneous
effects of breastfeeding and contraceptive use on fertility, I model the relationship between lactation and contraceptive use and birth-spacing with
controls for parity and other background factors. The results of these
multivariate analyses are presented in
Table 2. The cessation of breastfeeding
significantly increased the likelihood
of another conception for second and
higher parities. The conception rate for
second or higher parity births not
breastfed was approximately 1.5 to 2
times that of breastfed infants. However, breastfeeding firstborn infants
had no effect on the likelihood of a second conception. The lactation coefficient for first births is positive, but not
significant, regardless of other factors
introduced into the model.

All contraceptive methods significantly reduced the likelihood of a
following conception for all parities,
but the most effective method of contraception was the IUD.® IUD use

6Only about 2 per cent of contraceptive users for
all parities used barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms) compared to over 10 per cent who used
IUD’s. Because of the smaller number of barrier
users, these factors were combined. In addition,
hormonal injection users were combined with hormonal pill users, again because of the small number
of injection users. Traditional methods include the
rhythm method, withdrawal, and ‘“‘other”’ methods.

 

Social Biology

had the largest effect for all parities.
Women using an IUD following a third
or lower parity birth were six to seven
times less likely to conceive again than
were women who used no contraception at all. And IUD users with four or
more children were almost 40 times
less likely to conceive again than
women not using any contraceptive
method.

The use of oral and hormonal
contraceptives, as well as traditional
contraceptive methods, reduced the
likelihood of another conception compared to no contraceptive use at all.
Women who used oral or hormonal
contraceptives were about 2.4 to 4.7
times less likely to have another conception than women not using any contraception. And women who used traditional methods were two to three
times less likely to conceive again than
women not using any form of contraception.

The death of an index child before
age two increased the likelihood of a
subsequent conception at lower parities. Living second and lower parity
births were 1.5 to 1.7 times less likely
to be followed by another conception
than were children who died before
age two. At third parities, the effect of
a death was not significant, and for
fourth and higher parities the odds declined to 1.2. This finding suggests that
replacement behaviors, such as increased frequency of intercourse or reductions in the duration of contraceptive use, are more likely to follow the
death of a low parity birth (second or
lower parity) than a higher parity birth.

Over 59 per cent of the contraceptive users used the
rhythm method for all parities.

fOnly 1 per cent of first unions were formed after the third birth, so this variable was not included in the models for third birth

to fourth, and fourth to fifth, and subsequent intervals.

The desire to ‘“‘replace” a lost child
may diminish once a certain family size
is attained.

Entry into first union, either formal
marriage or cohabitation, increased
the odds of another conception compared to remaining single, as did remaining in a union following a first
birth. Most Bolivian women marry,
and their unions are relatively stable
over time. At the date of the interview,
85 per cent of the women were in
unions, and of these, 93 per cent were
still in their first union. However, because a complete marital history is not
available, the measure of union stability only corresponds to recently formed
unions. The weak effects reflect, in
part, weak measurement.

Sex of child was not significant in
any of the models, as expected. This
finding lends support to my contention
that gender preference is not important
in determining family size in Bolivia.
The age of the mother at birth of the
index child was negative and significant
for all parities. Older mothers, in par
ticular following high parity births,
were less likely to have another conception than were younger mothers.
Measures of mother’s education indicate that higher education (nine or
more years of school), compared to basic levels of schooling (1 to 5), lowered
the odds of another conception occurring. With the inclusion of measures of
contraceptive use in the model, the effects of higher education diminished,
except for third and higher parities.
For third and higher parities, nine or
more years of education, compared to
basic schooling, lowered the odds of
giving birth by about 1.5. Thus, in Bolivia, secondary schooling is associated
with contraceptive knowledge and use.
Mothers who work for pay were less
likely to have a subsequent conception
than mothers not working for pay. For
all parities, if the woman worked for
pay, she was about 1.3 times Jess likely
to have another conception than if she
did not. Employment outside the home
may indicate reduced exposure to intercourse or increased contraceptive

use, both of which lengthen the birth

interval.

Women married to partners with no
schooling were generally 1.4 to 2 times
less likely to have another conception
than were women whose partners had
basic levels of schooling. This result
was somewhat surprising and is discussed later. Having no partner at the
date of interview, compared to having

wa partner with little education (1 to 5
Syears), lowered the odds of conception
aby at least 2.5 times. This finding sugEgests that being single in Bolivia (widSowed, divorced, separated, or never
Cmarried), reduces a woman’s exposure
Sto intercourse and the risk of conception. Because it is measured at the date
“of interview, however, partner inforSmation does not necessarily correSpend with the birth history and must
e interpreted with caution.

Regional effects on family forma«tion emerged at higher parities. Living
pin the Altiplano and Valles regions,
‘Zcompared to living in the Llanos reSgion, reduced the odds of conception
Sby 1.3. The greatest concentration of
pindigenous peoples are in the Altiplano
and Valles regions. This same result
gs reflected in the coefficients for lan~puage spoken at home. Among women
swith four or more births, speaking
Qan indigenous language, compared to

speaking Spanish, lowered the odds of

conception by about 1.3.

Urban residence reduced the risk of
a subsequent conception for all except
third parity births. For second and
lower parity births, women living in urban centers were approximately 1.2
times less likely to have another conception than were rural women.

These findings reflect differences in

ated with ethnicity and urbanization.
Poor, rural, indigenous women generally do not attempt to limit family size,
but continue childbearing throughout
their fecund years. In contrast, highly
educated, urban women both limit and
space their births. Further discussion
of these results follows.

DISCUSSION
LACTATION

Breastfeeding by Bolivian mothers
prolonged the birth-interval and significantly reduced the likelihood of a subsequent conception, but only for second and higher parity births. Two
possible factors may account for differences by parity: (1) maternal health,
and (2) breastfeeding patterns.

Previous research indicates that
repeated pregnancies and poor nutrition deplete the mother’s body
and lengthen the period of postpartum
amenorrhea (Huffman, 1987; Carballo, 1987). In addition, studies of the
effects of nutritional supplementation
on lactating women determined that
fertility returned faster after the nutritional status of the mother improved
(Ramachandran, 1987; Fink et al.,
1992).

Mothers of firstborn children are
generally in better health than women
who have experienced additional pregnancies and deliveries. It is possible
that ovulation returns sooner following
the birth of the first child, despite long
durations of lactation. Similarly, the
contraceptive effect of breastfeeding
may be greater following repeated
pregnancies due to the depletion of the
mother’s nutritional status. Unfortunately, J am unable to evaluate mother’s nutritional status in this study.

Other studies, however, suggest
that variations in breastfeeding practices account for parity effects on fertility (Ramachandran, 1987). Breastfeeding practices may differ by parity
because initiating breastfeeding for the
first time may be more difficult than
subsequent breastfeeding experiences,
and thus the intensity of breastfeeding
may vary.

Breastfeeding is a learned behavior
and requires the coordination of several reflexes. The interplay of these
reflexes is often difficult to establish.
Because most women in Bolivia breastfeed their infants, their first lactation
experience generally follows the first
birth, and difficulties establishing and
maintaining lactation the first time may
reduce its contraceptive effect (Da
Vanzo et al., 1990). Thus, the lack of a
breastfeeding effect on fertility following the first birth may indicate differences in the intensity and frequency of
breastfeeding by parity, both of which
influence the duration of postpartum
anovulation (Ramachandran, 1987).

CONTRACEPTIVE USE

The use of the IUD (compared to
not using any contraception) was the
most effective method in lowering the
odds of another conception. However,
of all women sampled, less than 5 per
cent were IUD users, and less than
12 per cent used any form of modern
contraception. Once inserted, the effectiveness of the IUD, unlike other
forms of contraception, does not depend on a woman’s knowledge of
reproduction (as does the rhythm
method) or her behavior (as do oral
contraceptives or barrier methods).
Thus, little education is needed for

 

Social Biology

women to use the IUD effectively. For
other contraceptive methods, such as
the pill, diaphragm, or rhythm method
to be used more effectively, increased
education of women, especially in regard to reproduction and contraceptive
use, 1s needed.

For all parities, higher maternal education (nine or more years of schooling) lowered the odds of another
conception. This effect diminished at
lower parities, however, once contraceptive use was added to the model.
Thus, higher maternal education is
linked to increased contraceptive
knowledge and use at lower parities.
For high parity births (third and
higher), increased maternal education
lowered the odds of conception even
after contraceptive use was taken into
account. Thus, after three births,
higher education, compared to basic
schooling, reduced the relative risk of
conception independent of contraceptive use. Among women with three or
more births, it is probable that increased education, compared to only
basic schooling, not only promotes
contraceptive use, but also increases
the duration of use and the likelihood
that methods are used effectively (Da
Vanzo and Starbird, 1991).

FAMILY BACKGROUND AND COMMUNITY
ENVIRONMENT

For all parities, mothers whose current partner had no education were
less likely to have another conception
than mothers whose partners had a basic education. This result seems counterintuitive; one would expect education to be negatively associated with
fertility. Higher education is generally
associated with the desire to limit total

Sthe ability to space births (Cochrane,
£1979). Most poor, indigenous women
‘Sin Bolivia do not practice family limi‘station or stopping behavior, but do en2gage in behaviors, such as prolonged
“lactation, that influence birth-spacing.
‘In addition, other factors, such as maternal health and nutrition interact
with lactation and influence the length
sof the birth interval.
3 In the fertility model, partner’s edSucation provides a crude measure of
Esocioeconomic status, and in this case,
Ano education is possibly an indicator of
extreme poverty. As shown in Table 3,
a higher percentage of current partners
with no education work in agriculture
and farm their own land compared to
educated partners. The higher the education level of the partner, the lower
the percentage who farm their own
land and the higher the percentage
who receive a regular salary from nonagricultural work. This suggests that
education and occupation effects inter
n

act producing an index of poverty.
Men with no education generally are
poor, subsistence level farmers compared to those with at least some education.

In Bolivia, peasant farmers in general lack access to waste removal systems, potable water, and modern
health services which influence overall
health and nutritional status (Anaya,
1984). In addition poor farmers in the
Altiplano and Valles regions are able
to farm only one or two crops a year.
They must confront harsh ecological
conditions that often result in the total
loss of a harvest. Vegetables and staples are the primary crops, and there is
little access to markets. Families who
live in such conditions of extreme poverty are more likely to suffer from
malnutrition and disease, and poor
health and nutrition negatively influence fecundity (Huffman, 1987; Carballo, 1987; Ramachandran, 1987;
Fink et al., 1992). Low nutritional status extends the period of post partum

amenorrhea, especially among lactating women.’ In addition, poor health
can depress fecundity by increasing
the risk of fetal loss. An increase in
the occurrence of fetal loss will result in longer birth intervals. Only
conceptions ending in live births
were included in this analysis. Therefore, conceptions ending in spontaneous abortion were not accounted for.

In the fertility model, conditions of
poverty were further compounded by
race for high parity births. Both region
and language spoken significantly influenced the odds of conception following four or more births. Indigenous
speakers and those living in highly indigenous regions were less likely to experience another conception than were
Spanish speakers or those living in the
Llanos region. Again, it is probable
that indigenous women live in conditions of severe poverty which inhibit
fecundity. Especially after multiple
births, indigenous women, and those
living in highly concentrated indigenous regions are more apt to have poor
health and limited access to health services, clean water, and waste removal
systems. Disease and malnutrition are
products of their impoverished environment.

Thus, lactating women living in
impoverished households and communities are likely to experience long
periods of postpartum amenorrhea.
Although poorer women may have
higher total fertility than women with

7Jnteractions between lactation and partner’s
education (available from the author), although not
significant for all parities, were in the expected direction. Results indicate that living in poverty extends the effect of lactation on anovulation, further
reducing the likelihood of another conception.

Social Biology

higher socioeconomic status, extreme
conditions of poverty, in which many
Bolivian peasants live, may depress
fecundity and lengthen the time to conception. In addition, the negative effect of poverty on fecundity is exacerbated by multiple pregnancies.

The results of this fertility model
highlight the need to improve the
health of women and their children, especially those living in extreme poverty, by eliminating unwanted pregnancies and reducing total family size.
Efforts to improve the health and wellbeing of the indigenous and poorest
population must be coupled with increased contraceptive use in order to
space and limit births, in particular, as
the negative influence of poverty on
fecundity is reduced.

However, with increased education
(i.e., at the primary and secondary levels) and contraceptive use, it is essential that traditional breastfeeding
practices not decline to the detriment
of Bolivian children. Hence, the need
to introduce effective contraceptive
methods, and at the same time to promote and support breastfeeding, remains a major policy issue for health
planners in developing countries such
as Bolivia.

Although my results emphasize the
importance of lactation and contraceptive use in fertility regulation in Bolivia, greater understanding of the links
among breastfeeding, contraceptive
use, and the health and well-being of
women and children in poverty is required. In particular, further research
is needed to elucidate the negative relationship between breastfeeding and
contraceptive use, particularly in the
context of the developing world.
