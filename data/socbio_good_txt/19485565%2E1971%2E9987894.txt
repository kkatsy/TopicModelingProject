Five years ago, when it was expected that
i the acceptability of the pill and the intrao uterine device might match their effectivesness, high, even extravagant, hopes were
‘g held for these two modern contraceptives.

because of evidence that terminators of the
IUCD are finding their way to a variety of
procedures outside the program.

port an entire family-planning program, it
is still worth assessing how much may be
accomplished by a single contraceptive in
order to acquire more perspective on how
much of the job has to be shouldered by
supplementary procedures—alternative contraceptives, abortion, and sterilization. The
purpose of this paper is to present first results from a computerized matrix model and
more specifically to estimate the impact of
the IUCD consistent with given ages of acceptance and retention rates. The intrauterine device is selected over the pill for
discussion because its continuation rates in
mass programs have generally been more
favorable than those of hormonal contraception.
BACKGROUND

Two kinds of contraceptive impact must
be distinguished: first are demographic effects on the population in terms of births
averted and birth rates lowered; second are
the benefits to individual couples in terms
of aiding them to space and limit births.

The number of births averted by a contraceptive depends on the number of acceptors and on births averted per acceptor. In
populations where contraception is not yet
widespread, the most likely acceptors of

program contraception are couples (1) who
have all the children they want, i.e., have
a limiting rather than a spacing motive;
(2) who believe themselves still fertile; and
(3) who have not yet found their way to a
satisfactory contraceptive (Potter, Freedman, and Chow, 1968, p. 850, 851). Acceptors tend to have shorter open intervals from
last birth than nonacceptors (Berelson, 1969,
p. 370, 371). Presumably a recent delivery
makes the issue of family limitation more
salient and serves notice of continued fertility. This selection is important because
a recent birth heightens chances that the
couple are still fertile. As a result of a lower
proportion sterile, their fecundity tends to
be higher than that of coeval nonacceptors
by a relative amount that increases with advancing age.

Among couples seeking to limit rather
than to space births, births averted per acceptance of a contraceptive depend principally on three factors (Potter, 1969, p. 417420; Wolfers, 1969). First is the couples’
fecundity and the prospect that they will remain fertile during usage of the contraceptive. Second is the Jength of usage and its
outcome in accidental pregnancy or not.
Third is the degree to which the program
contraceptive is substituting for other family-planning measures and the relative efhcacy of these procedures,

Because of its close relation to her current
and prospective fecundity, a woman’s age
at time of acceptance is of great importance.
If most marriages are being contracted while
the bride is in her teens or early twenties, if
there is little spacing of births, and if mortality is fairly low so that typical family-size
objectives are 3-5 births, then the mother’s
mean age at attainment of desired family
size is likely to be in the neighborhood of 30
years, though with a wide dispersion around
this mean. To the extent that there is late
marriage, deliberate child spacing, or high
infant mortality forcing compensatory births
and encouraging larger family-size targets,

Social Biology

the mean age at last desired birth will of
course rise above 30.

At the beginning of a national familyplanning program, with little contraception
and mostly abortion having been practiced
previously, all couples at or beyond desired
family size who believe themselves still fertile are prime candidates for the recommended contraceptive. Consequently, the
program obtains a good response from women in the last third as well as the middle
third of the reproductive period. As a result,
mean age of mother at first acceptance of
program contraception in several Asiatic
programs (Mauldin et al., 1967, Table 3)
falls mostly in the range of 32 to 34 years.

After several years of program activity,
many of the women 35 and over have already tried the recommended contraceptive
and either are practicing it or have finished
with it. More and more, the eligible candidates, when they are not spacers, are limiters
who have recently reached desired family
size and are in their late 20’s or early 30’s.
Hence, as observed in Taiwan or Korea, the
average age of [UCD acceptors has been progressively declining toward a value nearer
30 years (Berelson, 1969, p. 362; Freedman
and Sun, 1969, p. 18).

Accordingly, in what follows, age 32.5
years may be taken as a typical age of acceptance while 27.5 signifies a rather young
age and 37.5 an age considerably older than
average.

THE MODEL

The present model is designed to follow
the residual fertility of a cohort of women
who at the same exact age, directly following
a birth, have an intrauterine device inserted.
The model is of the expected-value type
based on procedures of matrix multiplication. Its computer program, ACCOFERT,
and the derivations of parameter values are
described in a technical appendix available
on request (Potter, ms.).

The perspective is biostatistical. At any

time during the reproductive period a woman either is already sterile or if still fertile
she is in one of three states: fecundable,
anovulatory, or pregnant. During the third
month of pregnancy she is exposed to the
risk of abortion, During the ninth month
of pregnancy, she faces a risk of stillbirth.
These risks of spontaneous fetal wastage increase with advancing age. Following an
abortion, the anovulatory period is one
month; following a stillbirth, the anovulatory period is distributed with a mean of 2
months and a standard deviation of 1.2; following a live birth it is distributed according
to a Pascal distribution, though with the
two parameters progressively changing to
give a mean and standard deviation that increase with age. During an anovulatory
month a woman cannot conceive, while during a fecundable month chances of conception are governed by her natural fecundability. This natural fecundability declines
as she ages. The onset of secondary sterility
may occur any month unless she is pregnant.
It is assumed that sterility cannot interrupt
a pregnancy, but risk of sterility accumulates during a pregnancy and therefore may
happen directly following it. The conditional
monthly probabilities of becoming sterile if
nonpregnant and fertile at start of the
month or if just terminating a pregnancy
are also treated as functions of wife’s age.

 

One-method Family Planning 3

FECUNDITY PARAMETERS

Parameter values respecting fecundability, risk of spontaneous fetal wastage, and
length of postpartum anovulation are summarized in Table 1 and are more precisely
defined in the aforementioned appendix.
These assumptions are chosen to fit with the
results of a series of statistical analyses of
Taiwan data by A. K. Jain (1969, 19698,
1970). In the second to last column of Table
1 are given the birth intervals expected of
still fertile women if the fecundity parameters characteristic of a specified age were
to remain constant. These expected intervals increase from slightly over two years at
the start of the reproductive period to three
and a half years near the end of it, with a
gain of 10 months between ages 20-24 and
35-39 years.

From the work of L. Henry, (1961, p. 85),
it is posited that the proportions sterile at
ages 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 are 0.03, 0.06,
0.10, 0.16, and 0.31 respectively. Proportions sterile at intermediate ages are derived
by linear interpolation. From these proportions sterile at exact age x are calculated the
age-specific conditional probabilities of becoming sterile during a month if still fertile
at the start of the month. Above age 40
years, it is assumed that the proportion
sterile increases linearly to 1.0 at age 46.5
years. This latter figure was reached by a

trial and error procedure. Successive values
in half-year steps between 45 and 50 years
were tried to determine which value would
generate ratios between the birth rate for
ages 45-49 and those for ages 20-24 and
25-29 most in keeping with ratios observed
in two Asiatic samples presumably practicing little family limitation (Tuan, 1958, p.
43-45; Smith, 1960, p. 107-112).

Some of the implications of these adopted
fecundity assumptions are displayed in Table 2. From the top row one sees that in the
absence of contraception a woman having a
birth at age 20 can expect to average approximately 20 years to onset of secondary
sterility during which period she will average 8.3 births. Incidentally, this latter estimate is 0.7 higher than the average completed family size of 7.6 births reported by
Tuan for a sample of rural Taiwan women
aged 50-64 at time of survey (in 1952) and
still married at age 50 (Tuan, 1958, p. 47).
However, if the 4% childless are removed
from Tuan’s sample in order to increase
comparability with the assumptions underlying ACCOFERT, average family size increases to 8.0; and it is likely that eliminating the minority of women marrying after age 20 would raise the estimate to 8.3 or
above. It may also be argued that the
ACCOFERT figure of 8.3 births is broadly
compatible with a mean final parity in the
Cocos-keeling sample of 8.8 (Smith, 1960,

Social Biology

p. 111), since the latter value is enhanced by
early marriage.

If a woman has produced a birth at age x,
she cannot have become sterile earlier. Her
age at last known birth becomes her age at
which sterility risk commences (Col. 1 of
Table 2).1 As this age increases from 20 to
37.5 years, the interval to next conception
or to onset of sterility whichever occurs
sooner (Cols. 2 and 3) becomes increasingly
longer and more variable as a function of
declining fecundity. The mean number of
fecundable months during this interval (Col.
4) exhibits a like progression. However, near
the end of the reproductive period, the trend
reverses with the length and variability of
intervals to the next event of conception or
sterility becoming much smaller, and likewise for the number of fecundable months
within these intervals. By way of explanation, the entries of Column 5 show that
while secondary sterility rarely intervenes
before next conception when the mother is
37.5 years or younger, it does so more than
half the time when she bears a child as late
as age 42.5 years. To conceive again, such
an old mother must do it promptly. The
long intervals to next conception that might
be expected from her low fecundity are pre
1 This simplifying assumption is not strictly correct because the husband may be the cause of
sterility. More strictly, then, assuming no extra
marital relation, the risk of sterility starts with the
birth date less 9 months.

vented from realization by the intercession
of sterility.

As noted already, if a woman has produced a birth at age x, she cannot have become sterile earlier. Hence, the older her
known age at a birth, the older becomes her
expected age at onset of secondary sterility.
This progressive increase in the expected
age at onset of sterility is important because
it means a larger potential fertility at advanced ages than would otherwise be the
case. For example, according to Columns 5
and 6 of Table 2, expected additional births
and pregnancies following a birth at age 37.5
years are still 1.5 and 2.0 respectively.

ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT CONTRACEPTION

Another set of assumptions relate to effectiveness of the IUCD and the length of its
retention. Effectiveness refers to the proportionate reduction in fecundability effected
by the device in situ. From another analysis
(Potter et al., 1970, p. 98, 99) is obtained
an estimate of 0.95 effectiveness. Assumptions about retention are guided by unpublished results from a life-table analysis by
A. Hermalin and L. P. Chow of data from
the second Taiwan island-wide follow-up
study of IUCD acceptors. The data are
coded in terms of “multiple segments”
rather than just first segments. If a woman’s
first segment of IUCD use is followed by a
reinsertion without a pregnancy intervening, the second segment is combined with
the first to form a multiple segment. It is
estimated that these multiple segments include about 90% of all reinsertions.?

Life-table data on IUCD retention typically show during the first few months a
drop in the conditional probability of terminating useful wearing of a device during the
month if wearing it usefully at the start of
the month. These conditional probabilities
then level off at a value which is high at
young ages and progressively lower for older

ages of acceptors (Freedman and Takeshita,
1969, p. 251-254). To allow for the relatively higher discontinuation rates of the
first few months, a proportion of immediate
droppers of the device is postulated. A
methodology similar to that of Mauldin,
Nortman, and Stephan (1967, p. 7, 8) is
used to estimate the proportion of women
not immediately dropping the IUCD and
the constant monthly conditional probability of discontinuing the IUCD typical for
each five-year age group of acceptors. For
lack of data, the parameter values derived
for age group 35-39 years are ascribed to
age group 40-44 years.’

The basic life-table data and parameters
estimated from them are assembled in Table
3. The last column lists expected lengths of
retention, which range from 22 months for
acceptors age 20-24 years to nearly 60
months for acceptors aged 35-39 years. Actually, these expectations are an oversimplification of what occurs in the model. The
useful wearing of a device may be ended by
sterility, by accidental pregnancy, or by
dropping it (i.e., by expulsion or removal).
Leaving aside the onset of secondary sterility, the conditional monthly probability of
terminating the [UCD rises for a time after
a birth as the proportion of wearers passing
beyond anovulation and therefore becoming
subject to the risk of accidental pregnancy
rises. Later the probability of terminating
declines very gradually as a consequence of
the slow decline of natural fecundability.

Contraception affects fertility by holding
women in the fecundable state longer than
would otherwise be the case. Intervals from
birth to next conception or to secondary

* Twenty-four months after insertion, the relative frequency of pregnancy, expulsion, and removal
as reasons for terminating the first segment are 0.16,
0.29, and 0.55. Reinsertion rates after pregnancy,
expulsion, and removal are 0.19, 0.65, and 0.09.
Multiplying reinsertion rates by respective frequencies and standardizing so that the three products sum to 1.0, one obtains for pregnancy 0.11, for
expulsion 0.62, and for removal 0.17. Thus, rein
sertions following pregnancy account for a little
more than 10% of total reinsertions.

sterility, whichever occurs sooner, are longer
and more varied in the presence of the
IUCD than without it. Compare Columns 2
of Tables 2 and 4. In Table 4, the length and
variability of these intervals (or their fecundable component) increase with rising age
of acceptor only up to age 32.5 years and
are lower for acceptors aged 37.5 or older.
The truncating effect of secondary sterility
is demonstrated in the last column of Table
4, While half of the older acceptors do not
have another conception because of sterility,
only 16% of the next younger group of acceptors have this experience.

RESULTS

The main results are contained in the
next two tables. Table 5 portrays the excess

fertility of women who adopt the LUCD at
specified ages, but then after finishing with
the device lapse into nonpractice of family
limitation. It is apparent from the top panel
of figures that for women accepting in the
middle of the reproductive period one multiple segment of the IUCD unsupplemented
by further birth control results in a considerable excess fertility. For example, for
acceptors aged 32.5 years, the expectation
exceeds two unwanted births.

We may also consider what happens if
after terminating the IUCD the women resort to repeated abortion, but to no further
contraception. See the lower panel of figures
in Table 5. A great many abortions are needed to eliminate further births, at least if the
woman is 32.5 years or younger when the

device is inserted. This large number of
abortions reflects partly the length of the
period between terminating the device and
onset of secondary sterility, but also reflects
the brevity of intervals between consecutive
abortions when contraception is not practiced. In contrast to a live birth that entails
9 months of pregnancy and perhaps a year
of anovulation, an abortion entails only 3
months of gestation and perhaps one month
of postabortion anovulation. Furthermore,
without contraception the span of fecundable months needed for a conception averages
under a year. An implicit assumption is that
the induced abortions are done in a medically competent manner and therefore do
not increase the risks of secondary sterility.

From a population standpoint, a basic
measure of impact is births averted per
multiple segment of IUCD. For a given age
of acceptance and for given effectiveness and
retention of the device, births averted will
be maximal when the device is not substituting for other measures of family limitation. The case of nonsubstitution may be
operationalized by taking a cohort of women
who adopt the IUCD at a given age x, practice it for one multiple segment, and then

lapse into nonuse, and compare this cohort
with the same cohort when they practice
nothing from age x onwards. Differencing
the mean number of fecundable months to
next conception of the two cohorts (i.e., subtracting entries of Col. 4, Table 2 from those
of Col. 4, Table 4) gives the net delay of next
conception per segment of IUCD (second
column of Table 6). Differencing additional
births per woman of the two cohorts (i.e.,
subtracting values in Col. 2, Table 5, from
those of Col. 5, Table 2) yields births averted
per segment of IUCD (third column of
Table 6). Delaying the next conception
shortens the residual reproductive period
when additional births are a possibility. By
stipulating nonpractice of family limitation
after the next conception, the births foregone by the given shortening of the residual
reproductive period are maximized.
Despite this maximization, the estimated
births averted per multiple segment of
IUCD prove to be less than one. Reaching
a maximum among acceptors aged 32.5
years, the impact is less among younger acceptors because of their shorter retention
and is less amongst the oldest acceptors
mainly because of the truncation of useful

wearing time of the device by secondary
sterility. Of course in populations such as
Korea and Taiwan, there is considerable
substitution of the TUCD for other contraception or abortion (Chang et al., 1969). Allowing for substitution tends to lower estimates of births averted still further. Also,
because substitution is more common among
older than among younger acceptors, allowing for substitution tends to lower the age
of acceptance at which a maximum effect is
registered.

We may also ask the worth of a multiple
segment of IUCD in terms of abortions obviated. Here we take a cohort who adopt
IUCD at a given age x, practice it for one
multiple segment, and then rely on repeated
abortion, and compare this cohort with the
same cohort when they rely on repeated
abortion from age x onwards. Differencing
total abortions per woman of the two cohorts for different ages at acceptance yields
the estimates of abortions obviated that are
found in the last column of Table 6.

DISCUSSION

It is apparent that one multiple segment
of JUCD characterized by the discontinuation rates seen in Taiwan—and the rates in
other national programs are much the same
—typically falls far short of meeting the
family limitation needs of a mother who
reaches desired family size in her late twen
Social Biology

ties or early thirties. The exception is the
mother who has experienced no pregnancies
during a long period of nonprotection and
who therefore is assured of being seriously
subfecund if not sterile. Such a woman is
unlikely to accept a device anyway. According to the results above, with the exception
just noted, if a woman’s marriage remains
intact until the end of her reproductive period and if her last desired birth occurs at
age 32.5 or earlier, her expected residual
fecundity averages 3 births, or more. Therefore, if by itself a multiple segment of [UCD
averts no more than 0.85 births on average,
it is doing less than 0.3 of the job required.
If the mother tries to cope by following a
segment of IUCD with repeated abortion,
an average of 5 or more abortions are required to eliminate further childbearing unless the abortions are so badly done that
they are causing pathology.

When the mother accepts the IUCD late
in her reproductive period, say after age
37.5 years, the problem of additional excess
births is reduced by virtue of her limited
potential fertility. However, excluding delayed marriage or earlier recourse to induced
abortion, the late insertion implies that she
has already experienced excess births. In
any case, even given late insertion, the completeness of protection against subsequent
births to be gained by a multiple segment
of IUCD varies depending on the duration

to onset of sterility, the length of retention,
and whether the segment terminates in pregnancy or not. The fact that length of retention varies so greatly from one wearer to
another is not to be forgotten. According to
the data and estimates underlying Table 3,
although women aged 35-39 average nearly
60 months of retention, an appreciable minority, namely 26%, terminate within a year
and thus derive only fleeting protection.

Of course, what is actually happening to
program clients in Taiwan is quite different
than depicted above, according to results
from the second island-wide follow-up study
of IUCD acceptors. These data include information about the fertility and contraceptive status at the time of interview of the
acceptors who have already terminated the
IUCD (Freedman and Takeshita, 1969, p.

346-348). Thirty months after the original
insertion, less than half are still wearing a
device, but only 14% have had another
birth owing to heavy recourse to other procedures. Twenty-six per cent are practicing
contraception other than the IUCD or have
been sterilized. Of the 27% not currently
protected by contraception or sterilization,
almost four-tenths have aborted all subsequent pregnancies and another three-tenths
have had no further pregnancies, suggesting
subfecundity or secondary sterility.
