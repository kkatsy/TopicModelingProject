third-birth intentions or uncertainty.

The use of fertility intentions as a predictor of reproductive behavior continues
to be under considerable debate (e.g.,
‘= Bongaarts, 1992; Hendershot and Placek,
1981; Westoff, 1990; Westoff and Ryder,
1977). The center of the debate focuses
on the predictive ability of the preference
and intention questions asked in fertility
surveys. The usefulness of these quesyg tions has been challenged on the grounds
'S that individuals’ ideal family sizes may
= change over time and in response to the
changing social contexts in which childbearing decisions are made (Tan and Tey,
1994). Critics have pointed to the significant number of unwanted births in survey
data as evidence of the ineffectiveness of
intentions as predictors of actual fertility,
and of the difficulty in accessing contraception (Bongaarts, 1992, p. 102).

In response to this challenge, demographers and social biologists have made
considerable efforts to develop and assess

ABSTRACT: Using data from the 1995 Canadian General Society Survey (GSS-95), we study the
intention to have a third child among a sample of women and men who have already had two
children (N=505). Our results show that 15 per cent of the respondents intend to have a third
child, Nearly 20 per cent of the respondents are uncertain about their fertility intentions. We
found that the same factors that predict intentions also predict uncertainty, and that the effects
of these predictors are remarkably similar. In particular, intentions and uncertainty generally
decline with age, but increase with regular church attendance, remarriage, and being Catholic.
Unlike earlier studies, we found that the sex of previous children has virtually no impact on

erences, desires, and intentions.’ Their
findings suggest that most preference and
intention questions are generally valid
and useful (Bongaarts, 1992, p. 102):
“Survey measures of women’s desire to
continue childbearing are considered generally reliable, and although desired family size is subject to some bias ..., it,
too, largely serves its intended purpose.”
Several studies since Bongaarts (1992)
have further confirmed that fertility is primarily an intended behavior, and that fertility intentions provide fairly accurate
forecasts of subsequent fertility (e.g.,
Miller and Pasta, 1995; Schoen et al.,
1997; Tan and Tey, 1994; Thomson and
Hoem, 1996). Developments in contraceptive technology and new treatments
for infertility have now made fertility less

Placek (1981), and Footnote 3 in Bongaarts (1992, p.
108).

constrained by physical and biological
factors. Couples can use contraceptive
methods to control their fertility, and
many infertile couples can be treated effectively to become parents. Therefore, it
is reasonable to believe that conscious
fertility intentions govern the reproductive process.

The importance of intention studies
extends beyond population projection.
Another primary concern of these studies
has been to model and examine the patterns of uncertainty in childbearing decisions. Uncertainty arises particularly in
the stages of the life course where minimal family size has just been attained, but
an additional child would not necessarily
be unacceptable (Morgan, 1981, p. 267).
Patterns of uncertainty are not only important because ignoring them introduces
biases in the estimates of intended (parity) fertility, but because aggregate uncertainty has significant policy implications.
For example, if substantial numbers ‘of
couples indicate that they are uncertain
about whether they want a (another)
child, rather than deciding that no (further) children are intended, it is possible
that these couples may choose to have a
(another) child if there are positive reinforcements. “Uncertain” couples are the
most likely to be influenced by periodspecific factors, such as socioeconomic
conditions and population policy (Morgan, 1981).

Although the patterns and determinants of fertility intentions have been
well documented in the literature (e.g.,
Axinn et al., 1994; Laumon et al., 1988;
Lee and Khan, 1978; Miller, 1992; Namboodiri, 1974; Radecki and Beckman,
1992; Scanzoni, 1976; Waite and Stolzenberg, 1976; Westoff et al., 1963), little attention has been given to uncertainty in

Third Birth Intentions 97

fertility intentions. There are, however, a
few exceptions. For example, Morgan
(1981, 1982, 1985) made a series of attempts to document the changes in the
trends of fertility intentions and uncertainty between 1965 and 1976 using
American national survey data. He found
a dramatic decline in women’s intentions
to have more children, particularly at
higher parities, over this eleven-year period. The same period also witnessed a
rising level of uncertainty about having
additional children. Using similar data
sources, Sloane and Lee’s (1983) study
confirms these trends in intentions and
uncertainty and found that the sex of the
child(ren) the couple already had exerts a
profound influence on women’s subsequent fertility intentions, and on the level
of certainty about these intentions.
Although these studies provide valuable insights into the patterns of reproductive intentions and uncertainty, they
are limited in several ways. One limitation is the lack of appropriate social and
demographic controls in the analyses.
Previous explanations of intentions and
uncertainty are limited to age, parity, and
the sex of previous children. Other factors, such as education (Miller, 1992;
Radecki and Beckman, 1992), labor force
participation (Waite and Stolzenberg,
1976) and gender role attitudes (Scanzoni, 1976), are also related to fertility intentions. Another limitation is that while
the response variable has three categories
(i.e., “yes,” “no,” “don’t know”), it is invariably modeled as a simply binary response in these studies. Multiple options
in the intention question are not considered as competing choices and modeled
simultaneously (Maddala, 1983). Further,
though not necessarily a limitation, all
four studies are based on data collected in

the 1960’s and 70’s. Rapid social changes
in socioeconomic conditions, and advances in medical and contraceptive technology, make their findings less relevant
today than they were twenty years ago.

In this paper we attempt to address
each of these limitations. We employ national data from a recent Canadian survey
and consider a range of individual-level
characteristics that are known to influence reproductive intentions and behavior. We model multiple categories in the
response variable simultaneously and examine how individual characteristics may
influence the probability that an individual will choose any particular option
when responding to the fertility intention
question.

Our paper focuses on third-birth intentions and uncertainty. There are sound
theoretical reasons for this focus. First, as
in many industrial countries (e.g., Hoem
and Hoem, 1989; Kravdal, 1992; Wright
et al., 1988), a large part of Canadian fertility decline is attributable to the decline
in third-birth rates (e.g., Balakrishnan et
al., 1993). Second, the third birth is important in and of itself as it represents the
dividing line between below and above
replacement-level fertility (Wright et al.,
1988, p. 489). Third, the social norms
against childlessness and one-child families have been persistent throughout most
of the century (Balakrishnan et al., 1993;
Ryder, 1973). Census data confirm that
the two-child family has been the most
common family size in North America in
recent decades. Therefore, it is logical to
assume that the minimal acceptable family size may well be two for a large number of couples, and that many couples
may eventually have two children (cf.
Morgan, 1982). Thus, our knowledge and
understanding of the factors that influ

will become increasingly important.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
- DATA

The data used in this study are drawn
from the 1995 Canadian General Social
Survey (GSS-95). The GSS-95 is the
tenth round of the General Social Survey,
conducted by Statistics Canada. The survey was based on a national probability
sample of 5,914 women and 4,835 men
(N=10,749) aged 15 and older, excluding
residents of the Yukon and Northwest Territories, and full-time institutionalized residents. Telephone interviews were used to
collect the data, with an overall response
rate of 80.7 per cent.”

The GSS-95 focused on the family. It
collected detailed information on marital
and childbearing histories, reproductive
intentions, family values, and gender role
attitudes, as well as socioeconomic characteristics. The measurement of fertility
intention is based on the question, “Do
you intend to have a/another child sometime?’ The question was asked to respondents only if (a) they were currently
in a marital or cohabiting (heterosexual)

The overall response rate of 80.7 per cent is quite
reasonable for a large national probability survey like
the GSS-95 (N= 10,749). The rate is also comparable to
other Canadian or American national surveys. For example, the 1990 Canadian General Social Survey (GSS90) had a response rate of 73 per cent. The response
rates for the 1984 Canadian Fertility Survey (CFS) and
the American 1987-88 National Survey of Families and
Household (NSFH) were 70 per cent and 75 per cent,
respectively. Further, we have no reason to suspect that

there are significant systematic biases introduced

through nonrespondents.

If the respondent was unclear about the question,
the interviewer was allowed to explain that intended
children do not include step- and adopted children.

union, and (b) the female partner was under the age of 50. Consistent with prior
research, we excluded the respondents/
their partners who were pregnant, and
those who were sterilized either due to a
natural cause or through a surgical procedure.* To study the third birth, we further
restricted the sample to respondents who
had two children of their own at the time
of the survey. With these restrictions, our
study sample includes 253 women and
252 men (N=S05).

MEASURES

As noted, the dependent variable in the
analysis is fertility intention. It is a trichotomous variable indicating whether the

respondent gave a “yes,” “no,” or “don’t

know” response to the survey question on
intention. The proportions of the respondents who chose each of the options are
0.15, 0.66, and 0.19, respectively.

Previous studies of fertility intentions
have generally focused on the effects of

‘The primary reason for excluding pregnant respondents (and respondents with pregnant partners) is that for
these respondents, a third child is almost a certainty.
Since our focus is on third birth intentions (not the decision to terminate a pregnancy), including these respondents would introduce biases in our estimates of intentions. Further, Morgan (1982) argues that omitting
surgically sterilized respondents overestimates the proportions of respondents who either intend more children
or are uncertain about their childbearing plans. These respondents are indeed those who are most certain they
will not have any more children. We estimated separate
models that treated respondents (or their partners) who
were sterilized as not intending any more children and
found results similar to those reported here. (These results are available from the authors upon request.) However, because we had no information on the date of surgical operations or the timing of sterilization, we felt that
the key explanatory variables could not be considered to
be causally prior to sterilization and would therefore
have to be excluded from the analysis. For these reasons,
and to be consistent with most other studies (e.g., Miller,
1992; Sloane and Lee, 1983), we chose to report the results excluding sterilized respondents/ partners.

one or more social demographic characteristics. There has been relatively little
theoretical work on intentions.* However,
we believe that theories of fertility behavior should be utilized in the explanation
of fertility intentions and uncertainty. Indeed, Rindfuss et al. (1988) have shown
that the variables that determine fertility
are also relevant to fertility intentions.
They conjecture that socioeconomic and
other background variables may affect
fertility behavior through intentions, a
hypothesis that is consistent with Fishbein’s (1972) behavioral intention theory.

In this study we consider several explanatory variables that are known to be
important to the process of making reproductive decisions. The theoretical framework underlying our analysis is two-fold.
First is the assumption that when couples
decide to have a (another) child, they attempt to improve their welfare by comparing benefits and costs (Becker, 1981).
Second is that childbearing decisions are
made in the context of current social and
cultural conditions. We consider several
individual characteristics that may directly or indirectly reflect the benefits and
costs of having a (another) child. We hypothesize that they also affect reproductive intentions and uncertainty.

Table 1 provides operational definitions
and descriptive statistics for the covariates
used in the analysis. In brief, we consider three variables measuring respondents’ socioeconomic status (SES). We use a
dummy variable indicating whether the respondent was currently employed outside

‘There are a few notable exceptions. For example,
Werner et al. (1975) use Fishbein’s (1972) behavioral intention model to explore the psychological meaning of
having a third child. Miller (1994) develops a motivationdesire-intention model to explain reproductive behavior.

of the home. We measure personal income on a 12-point continuous scale.
Like most large surveys, the percentage
of missing income responses in our study
sample is substantial (20 per cent). To
avoid a significant reduction in sample
size, the missing values were replaced
with the mean income. A dummy variable
for missing values is included in the regression analyses. Further, education is
coded on a 6-point continuous scale,
ranging from elementary school (or less)
to university degree. The mean educational level is some post-secondary
school education. Earlier research has
shown that the effects of SES, particularly education, on fertility intentions are
gender-patterned (Mason and Taj, 1987;
Radecki and Beckman, 1992). Because
an increase in SES tends to raise the (opportunity) costs of childbearing, we anticipate that SES has a negative impact on
third birth intentions, particularly for
women (Becker, 1981).

The effects of cultural factors on fertility intentions and behavior have been
well documented (e.g., Hirschman, 1994).
We consider four variables for cultural
background. Three dummy variables are
used to indicate whether the respondent
was (a) Catholic, (b) residing in the
province of Quebec, and (c) born in
Canada. Religiosity is measured by
church attendance. We expect that being
Catholic and/or a regular church goer increases the desire for a third birth (e.g.,
Namboodiri, 1974; Westhoff and Ryder,
1977; Thornton et al., 1992). While Quebec has been predominantly Catholic,
Quebec fertility has been persistently below the national average over approximately the past three decades. Indeed, the
French-English dualism has been the
most distinct demographic characteristic

Third Birth Intentions

 

of the country throughout its history (Balakrishnan and Wu, 1992). For these reasons, we anticipate that Quebeckers are
less likely to intend a third child than
non-Quebeckers.

We also use eleven variables to capture the influences of demographic determinants on fertility intentions and uncertainty. We use a dummy variable for
gender (Mason and Taj, 1987). Age is
measured in years, and we include a quadratic term to test the curvilinear effect of
age. We anticipate a negative effect of age
on third birth intentions (e.g., Morgan,
1981, 1982). Union status is a dummy
variable indicating whether the respondent was in a marital union or in a cohabiting union. The effect of union status has
not been systematically examined, probably because cohabitation is only a recent
phenomenon. Because cohabiting unions
are considerably less stable than marriages (Wu and Balakrishnan, 1994), and
the desire to invest in union-specific capital such as children declines with perceived risk of union disruption (Becker et
al., 1977), we should expect that cohabiting couples are less likely to intend a
third birth than married couples.

Age at first union is used as a proxy
for the cost of the partner/marital search.
A younger age at first union may reflect a
shorter search, which may result in a poor
match (Becker et al., 1977). Thus, a
younger age at first union may lead to a
less stable union and lower the probability of intending a third birth. We use a
dummy variable indicating whether the
current union was a remarriage. However,
the effect of remarriage is ambiguous. On
one hand, because remarriages tend to be
less stable than first marriages (White and
Booth, 1985), remarried individuals may
be less likely to intend a third birth than

102

individuals in their first marriages. On the
other hand, remarried people at Parity 2
may want another child (with their current spouse), because one or both of their
children may have been born in the previous marriage.

We use three dummy indicators for
heterogamy in unions: one for a difference in past union/marital status between
the partners, and two for age-discrepant
partnerships (i.e., husband/male partnerolder and wife/female partner-older partnerships). A discrepancy between the
partners’ characteristics may result from
attempts to reduce search costs, thereby
increasing the chances of a mismatch.
This increased chance of mismatch
should reduce the incentive to invest in
union-specific capital such as children.
Thus, heterogamy should decrease the
desire for a third child.

Three variables are included for the
characteristics of the two children that the
respondent has had. Both age of the second child and (second) birth interval are
measured in years. Age of the second
child is used as a proxy for the (possible)
third-birth interval. A younger age of the
second child may suggest a shorter thirdbirth interval if a third child is intended.
We anticipate that the likelihood of intending a third child increases when the
respondent’s second child is younger, and

the (second) birth interval is shorter.

Birth intervals are seen as important determinants of fertility in the sense that
they are proxies for fecundity (Bongaarts,
1978), although birth intervals are less
important in societies where fertility is
regulated through contraception. The sex
of previous children is measured as a trichotomy indicating whether the children
are both boys, both girls, or one boy and
one girl. Following Sloane and Lee

Wu and Wang

Social Biology

(1983), we expect that the likelihood of
intending a third child increases when
both children are of the same sex.

We use the number of siblings as a
measure of parental fertility behavior. The
idea that parental fertility and preferences
affect fertility behavior has been well supported in the literature (e.g., Axinn et al.,
1994). A large number of siblings is expected to increase the desire for a third
birth. Finally, we include a composite index for gender role attitudes. The index is
constructed by summing seven attitudinal
items, each of which is measured on a 5point Likert scale (Cronbach’s a=0.53).
The item wordings and the percentage
distributions are provided in Table 2. In
line with earlier studies, we anticipate that
egalitarian gender role attitudes lead to a
reduced probability of intending a third
birth (Rindfuss et al., 1988).

STATISTICAL MODELS

As the dependent variable is a trichotomy with three choice categories, the
multinomial logit model (Maddala, 1982)
is used. Following the growing literature
on probablistic choice models, we estimated a generalized logit model by specifying the ratio of the probability of taking
the ith alternative (e.g., giving a “yes” response) to the probability of taking some
standard alternative (e.g., giving a “no”
response). To be consistent with prior
studies (Morgan, 1981, 1982; Sloane and
Lee, 1983), we estimated models for two
contrasts: the probability of giving a “no”
response versus the probability of giving
the other two responses, respectively. The
two multinomial logit models can be
written as:

(1)
(2)

Prob(y=1)/Prob(y=k)=exp(B,*x)
Prob(y=ji)/Prob(y=k)=exp(B i X)

RESULTS

Our empirical analysis begins with a
descriptive account of reproductive intentions and uncertainty as observed in

1995. Table 3 presents data on birth intentions by age and parity.° To provide a
baseline group for comparison, we relaxed parity constraints in sample selection. Thus, the data presented in the table
include all respondents who met the selection criteria, apart from parity, discussed earlier. Table 3 shows that the percentage of yes responses decreases with
age and parity, which is consistent with

example, at parity 0, 86 per cent of the
respondents under age 30 intend to have
a child. The percentage of yes responses
declines to 73 per cent for the 30-34 age
group, and 35 per cent for respondents

with age. While less than 8 per cent of the
respondents under age 30 intend to remain childless, this percentage rises to 12
per cent for the 30-34 age group, and to
56 per cent for those aged 35 and over.
The age pattern of uncertainty at parity 0
is clearly not linear. It appears that only a
small fraction of people under 30 are uncertain about their fertility intentions. Uncertainty rises in the early 30’s and declines thereafter. However, the proportion
of uncertain responses is not trivial. Overall, 9.4 per cent of childless respondents
are uncertain about their fertility plans,
compared to the 19.4 per cent of respondents who intend to remain childless.
Table 3 shows similar age patterns of
fertility intentions at parity 1. It is interesting to note that virtually the same proportion of people under age 30 at parity

1, as at parity 0, intend to have a (another) child. These results may reflect the
emerging norms for two-child families in
North America (e.g., Balakrishnan et al.,
1993). Further, as expected, the percentage intending another child declines with
age. Compared to the data at parity 0,
there is considerably more uncertainty
about fertility intentions among individuals in their 30’s and older. The percentage
of no responses is nearly doubled for the
30-34 age group, although it changes little for the other two age groups.

We turn now to the data on couples at
parity 2, who are the focus of our paper.
We again observe similar age patterns of
intentions and uncertainty. The parity pattern emerges when we compare across
the parity tables. Overall, childbearing intentions decline with age and parity. The

converse is the case for child-stopping.
Additionally, there is considerable uncertainty involved in fertility intentions. The
degree of uncertainty is generally low at
young ages, but rises in the early 30’s and
declines thereafter. Uncertainty also increases with parity. Nearly one-third of
respondents under age 35 are uncertain
about whether they want a third child.

Intentions and uncertainty not only
change with age and parity, they may also
be affected by the sex composition of
previous children. Table 4 shows that individuals who have a pair of same-sex
children are more likely to intend a third
birth than individuals who have children
of different sexes. The degree of uncertainty about a third child is also higher
among individuals who have children of
the same sex. While the direction of this
relationship is consistent with prior studies (e.g., Sloane and Lee, 1983), the significance of the effect is rather limited
(p=0.075). As shown, the effect of the
sex of previous children fails to reach the
significance level once we remove the effects of other variables.

Tables 5 and 6 show parameter estimates from a series of nested multinomial logit models of fertility intentions
and uncertainty. As noted, we estimated
models for two probability contrasts: (1)
yes versus no, and (2) uncertain versus
no. Table 5 reports the parameter estimates for the first set of contrasts (intention models), and Table 6 for the second
set (uncertainty models). In modeling intentions, we begin with the observed effects of SES, cultural background, demographic determinants, and gender role
attitudes, by modeling them separately.
The estimates for these specifications are
presented in Models | through 4 in Tables 5 and 6. In Model 5, we combine the

Third Birth Intentions 105

parameters of Models 1-4 to examine the
net impact of these characteristics. In
Model 6, we add three interaction terms
to test the hypothesis that the effects of
SES on intentions vary between women
and men.

We first look at the intention models.
Table 5 shows that the effects of SES indicators (work, income, and education) have
generally negative but insignificant effects
on intentions (see Model 1). The estimates
remain insignificant after other variables
are added (see Model 5). However, when
we add the interaction terms to the model
(see Model 6), we find that employed
women appear to be less likely to intend a
third child than nonemployed women,
which is consistent with the economic theory of fertility, while the reverse appears
to be true for men.’ The negative effect of
women’s employment on fertility intentions supports the notion that the (opportunity) costs of having additional children
are particularly high for employed mothers. All in all, our results suggest that SES
has limited impact on intentions.

The effects of cultural background on
intentions are evident in both the reduced
and the full models (see Models 2 and 6
in Table 5). As expected, we find a positive effect on Catholicism on intent for a
third child. Specifically, our results show
that the odds of intending a third child
are about 2.57 (e2*4/2) times higher for
Catholics than non-Catholics (see Model
6). Also consistent with our expectations,
church attendance has a positive effect.

"Holding other variables (including the intercept)
constant, we find the estimates for the four work X
sex subgroups are as follows: employed women
(—0.313=0.242 +0.138—0.693), nonemployed women
(0.589), employed men (0.797), and nonemployed men
(-1.073).

Further, the effect of nativity is negative
and significant, suggesting that intent for
a third child is more common among foreign-bom Canadians than native-born
Canadians. Given the lower level of fertility in the Province of Quebec, we anticipated that Quebeckers are less likely than
non-Quebeckers to intend a third child.
While the signs on the estimates are consistent with this expectation, the effects
are not significant at the 10 per cent level.
We consider a number of demographic
determinants. Table 5 shows that age appears to have a negative curvilinear effect
on intent for a third child, which is generally consistent with our earlier bivariate
analysis. Whether people are in marital or
cohabiting unions does not have a significant effect, nor does the age at which
they entered into their first unton. However, whether the current union is a remarriage does matter. Our results show
that the odds of intent for a third child are
nearly eleven times (e2*!-!%) higher for
remarried people than people in other
types of unions. This finding supports the
idea that remarried people may want a
third child because one or both of their
children may have been born during a previous marriage. Many remarried couples
want children from their current union.

Heterogamy in union status also has a
significant impact. As expected, heterogamous union status appears to decrease the
intent for a third birth, probably because of
higher perceived risk of union instability.
However, age differences between partners
does not have a significant effect. Further,
none of the characteristics of the children
has a significant impact, nor does the number of siblings. Finally, gender role attitudes
appear to have a positive though marginally
significant effect. As anticipated, individuals who hold more traditional gender
role attitudes are more likely to intend a
third child, which is consistent with prior
studies (e.g., Rindfuss et al., 1988).

Table 6 presents the parameter estimates for uncertainty models. Caution is
needed to interpret the estimates in the
table. Since we model the contrast of
don’t know versus no, a positive estimate
means a greater likelihood of choosing
don’t know (being uncertain) over no (intent for child-stopping). Similarly, a negative estimate indicates that the respondent is less likely to choose don’t know
over no. Again, we focus on the full
model (Model 6) in our discussion.

Table 6 shows that education has a marginally significant effect on uncertainty regarding a third child. People with higher ed

models, we find that Catholics are more
likely to be uncertain about their intentions than non-Catholics. Our data also
show that church attendance does not have
a significant influence on uncertainty. It
could be that regular church attendance
may help people decide their fertility

goals. Further, the degree of uncertainty
appears to be higher among non-Quebeckers, which is consistent with the lower fertility rate observed in Quebec. Finally, nativity does not show a significant effect.
Turning to the demographic determinants, we observe that the (main) effect

Vol. 45, No. 1-2

of gender is not significant. Again, age
has a negative curvilinear effect on uncertainty as in the intention models. Together, these results suggest that both the
desire for a third child and the degree of
uncertainty may initially rise in early
stages of the life course, then decline
rapidly as one ages. The concave effect of
age on uncertainty is congruous with our
earlier bivariate analysis.

Although union status remains insignificant as in Table 5, age at first union
shows a significant effect. We find that
people who delay entering into their first
union tend to be more uncertain about a
third child than those who enter at a
younger age. This finding is in line with
the view that a delayed entry into first
union may lead to a better match, which,
in turn, encourages couples to invest in
children. Further, we find that remarriage
has a positive impact. The degree of uncertainty is considerably higher among
remarried people than people in other
types of unions.

Consistent with the intention models,
we find that heterogamy in union status
discourages couples from having a third
child. Heterogamy in age is also significant. Child-stopping appears to be more
likely intended in partnerships that involve an older woman and a younger
man, and less likely when they involve an
older man and a younger woman. While
the negative effect of age difference may
be due to higher perceived risk of union
instability, it could also reflect the negative effect of a woman’s age on intentions. That is, a third birth is more likely
to be contemplated when the female partner is relatively young, and possibly in
early childbearing years.

Table 6 also shows that none but one
of the characteristics of previous children

 

Third Birth Intentions 109

is significant, and neither is the number
of siblings. As expected, we find that a
long child-spacing interval is associated
with the intention for child-stopping. Finally, gender role attitudes have a positive effect, suggesting that the degree of
uncertainty about a third child is higher
among people who hold more traditional
gender role attitudes.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We have aimed at improving our understanding of the intention to have a third
child among a recent sample of Canadian
women and men who have had two children. From an economic perspective, we
envision that individuals attempt to improve
their welfare when they decide whether
they want a third child. In this study we
consider a set of individual characteristics
that reflect some of the benefits and costs,
as well as other factors known to be important, and examine how these characteristics
may influence reproductive intentions.

Our empirical analysis suggests several conclusions. First, consistent with
prior studies (e.g., Morgan, 1982), age is
one of the most important factors influencing fertility intentions. We found that
third-birth intentions decline rapidly with
age. When the effects of other factors are
removed, intentions and uncertainty initially increase with age, and then decline
rapidly. These findings tell a consistent
story; intentions and uncertainty rise
when the female partner is relatively
young, and having a third child is a possibility. Intentions decline, and certainty
(about stopping) increases when the “biological clock” sets in, and the possibility
of having additional children diminishes.
The generally negative effect of aging is
also consistent with the well-supported

 
 

 

finding that fecundity declines with age
(e.g., Menken, 1985).

Second, we question whether the sex
of previous children actually affects fertility intentions, as previous research has
suggested (e.g., Sloane and Lee, 1983;
and Williamson, 1976). While individuals
who have same-sex children may appear
to be more inclined to consider a third
child than those who have children of dif
= ferent sexes, the effect of the sex of pre“vious children disappears when we reSmove the influences of other variables.
E Indeed, virtually none of the characteristics of the children that couples already
oo had has an impact. We suspect that the
co importance of sex preferences in repro= ductive decisions may have abated in re~~ cent years partly due to the rising number
of childless and one-child families, and to
Sothe changing norms about family sizes.
Third, it is not SES but cultural fac= tors such as religious affiliations and reli‘6 giosity that determine reproductive intentions. We found that Catholics and regular
church attenders are most likely to intend
‘ca third child. While some studies have
- shown a declining impact of religion, parS ticularly Catholicism, on fertility behavior
Bin the 1970’s and early 1980’s (e.g., WestSoff and Jones, 1979; Balakrishnan and
‘= Chen, 1990), the influence of religion reOmains, or reemerges, in reproductive intentions as in the process of union formation and dissolution (e.g., Lehrer and
Chiswick, 1993; Sander, 1993).

Fourth, we found that remarriage is
the most important demographic determinant, and that remarried persons are more
likely to consider having a third child
than people in other types of unions.
While the positive effect of remarriage
may be due to the fact that at least one of
the two children that the respondent had

ich

Wu and Wang

Social Biology

may have been born in the previous marriage, there is also a selection effect present. Because cohabitation has been a
popular life-style choice among divorced
individuals (Wu and Balakrishnan, 1994),
those who choose to remarry tend to be a
select group who are more committed to
the partner or the institution of marriage,
which may also explain why remarried
individuals may want to invest more in
children. The effect of remarriage is interesting partly because remarriage has
been traditionally viewed as an incomplete social institution in which childbearing is discouraged (Cherlin, 1978).
As more people remarry and consider
having children with their new partner,
remarriage increasingly becomes a socially acceptable setting for childbearing.
Since remarriage rates remain high, we
would expect more children to be born
into remarriages in the years to come.

Finally, our analysis suggests that the
same factors that predict intentions also predict uncertainty, and that the effects of these
predictors are remarkably similar. These
findings lend support to Morgan’s (1981, p.
267) contention that uncertain intentions
may take a middle position between firm intentions to continue or to stop childbearing.
Fertility intentions are better conceptualized
as an ordinal variable. Perhaps it may be
more realistic to view reproductive motivations and intentions as a multi-dimensional
continuum (cf. Morgan, 1981, p. 269). Recent work by Miller (1992, 1994) is particularly encouraging in that he views reproductive motivations, desires, and intentions as
separate constructs which gauge, sequentially, different stages of the reproductive
decision-making process.

The survival of any society partly depends upon how efficient its members are
at replacing themselves. Aggregate shifts

in third-birth rates have important ramifications for the future state of Canadian society. This study has shown that 15 per
cent of respondents at parity 2 intend to
have more children. Almost 20 per cent of
respondents at parity 2 are uncertain about
their fertility plans. If “uncertain” couples
are indeed in a transitional stage between
childbearing and child-stopping, and their
decisions are most likely to be influenced
by period factors (see Morgan, 1982), then
knowledge of how these couples are distributed in social groups will be important
to policy-makers so that they can design
and implement social policies that ensure
the future well-being of our society.
