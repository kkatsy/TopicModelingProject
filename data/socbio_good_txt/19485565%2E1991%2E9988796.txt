S ABSTRACT: A regression model expressing the age-specific fertility rates at a given point of time
S as a variable dependent upon the same at the preceding points of time has been developed by
© Das Gupta for purposes of fertility projection. The model, judged by the values of the multiple
5 correlation coefficients, appears to work very well with the U.S. data set, and it also produces
9 9 limiting values of the fertility rates when the projection is carried far into the future. The
A conditions of convergence of such a model have been determined in this paper according to which
oo the model’s usefulness for purposes of long-term projection of fertility rates appears to be severely

In a very interesting paper, Das
Gupta (1989) has presented a multiple

regression model to project ageY specific fertility rates at time ¢ from the

same at preceding time periods. Using
different notations his model can be
expressed as

folt) = Boa + BiaF(t-1)

10
+ Bog fa-i(t—i)
j=

+ B;,

i=

(fa+i(t— 1) + fa+ilt—2) )
(1)

where f,(t) is the age-specific rate at
age a in year ¢ and

Ft—1) = Sfilt—1) 2)

is the total fertility rate in year f-1. The
multiple correlations for all ages were
found to be quite high ranging from a
minimum of 0.845 at age 49 to a maximum of 0.999 at all three ages, 41, 42,
and 43. In fact, out of a total of thirtysix multiple correlations computed for

every single year of age in the age interval (14,49) all but five were greater
than 0.99. One of the interesting results that emerges out of the empirical
investigation of this model is that the
age-specific fertility rates and other
functions based on them stabilize after
reasonable lengths of time. Das Gupta
(1989, p. 267) has noted that ‘‘More research is needed to decide how many
independent variables should be used
in the multiple linear regressions and
what should be their precise
definitions. ... A prudent choice of
the variables in the multiple regressions should lead to convergence of the
age-specific fertility rates to some stable values, although this cannot be
proved mathematically.”

The purpose of this note is first.to
show that the convergence or lack of it
can be established in a straightforward
manner when the coefficient of B,,,

e., the total fertility rate is the sole
independent variable in (1). Second,
under certain simplifying but realistic
assumptions the same conclusion can

also be drawn, when additional variables, in the form of linear functions of
the age-specific fertility rates, like
those in (1), are included in the model.
These will be dealt with separately in
the next two sections.

CONVERGENCE WITH ONE
INDEPENDENT VARIABLE

Let us begin by writing the linear

model as
fit) = Bog + BigF (t-1) (3)

where the total fertility is the only in- |

dependent variable. Summing both
sides of (3) over a, we get

where —_
Bo= >) Boo | (5)

and : a |
By = > Bia (6)

The recurrence relationship in (4) can
be used to write the following for

t=1,2,...,
as
F(1) = By + B, F(O) (7)

F(2) = By + B, FQ) =
By + BoB, + Bt FO). (8)

and so on. The general expression for
t =n, (n>0), can be written as
F(n) = Bo(1+B,+By+--+ B~") + B,"F(0). (9)
It is easy to see that only when

(9) converges to _

CONVERGENCE WITH MORE
THAN ONE INDEPENDENT
VARIABLE

We begin the proof by first writing
fat) = (m(a) + 8,()) FO) (42)
where (a) is-some sort of an average
of the ratio of the age-specific fertility
rate to the total fertility rate. The average may be based on the time span
covered by the model Equation (1)
which in Das Gupta’s example is 38
years. The variable 6,(t) is a measure
of the deviation of the rate in year ft
from the average m(a) where the latter
is independent of t. We can expect that
5,(t) assumes only small values positive
as well as negative. Its expected value
for any a. and any ¢ can be taken as
zero.
Observe that the substitution of (12)
in (1) produces another expression of
the identity in the form of

f(t) = Cog t+ CigF(t-1) + C,,F(t-2) +
+ Cip,F(t-10) + E (13)

where the C’s are linear compounds of
the m’s and E is a linear compound of
6’s with weights proportional to F's.
Now we introduce our simplifying assumption that a linear function of a
large number of these 6,(t) with unrelated weights can be assumed to be
equal to zero. Therefore,

E=0 (14)

which makes f,(#) a linear compound

of F(t)s with known coefficients.
Next, summing (13) over age a, we
get

F(t) = Cy + C,F(t-1) + C,F(t-2) +
--- + CipF(t-10) (15)

where
C; = Sin >= 1, Zs === 10. (16)
a

The solution of (15) can be obtained by
the application of the principles of the
generating function or of those of the
mathematics of stable population. In
the following, we have used the latter
approach by first writing (15) in terms
of its continuous form as

F(t) = Co + f9Fte-u)ctuldu (17)
Equation (17) differs from the traditional Lotka’s integral equation due to
the presence of the constant Cp. A similar equation appeared earlier in a different context (Mitra), and it was
solved by differentiating (17) with respect to ¢ under the standard assumption of continuity and differentiability
of F(t). That operation reduces (17) to
the standard form of Lotka’s integral
equation as

F(t) = [°F t-u)Cluldu (18)
where we make the additional assumption that the differentiation can be carried under the integral sign.

As 1s well known, the limiting value
of the solution (Keyfitz, 1968) of the
integral equation (18) is

imo (t) = Qe* (19)

in which Q and w are constants. Also
> 0 according as

w=

P= f 7 Clujdu< = > 1. (20)
It may be noted that w can be compared with the intrinsic rate of growth
and P with the net reproduction rate of
the traditional stable population
model. Accordingly, the convergence
of (15) and therefore of (13) is guaranteed only when w<0 or P<1. In
that case,

Ick" (t) = 0 (21)
due to (19) and, therefore,
Mel (t) = K (22)

where K is a constant. Substitution of
(22) in (17) produces the following for
the limiting value of F(t) as

K=Cy)+KP (23)

where P is given by (20).
Since Cp and P are known, the limiting value of F(t) is now known as

K= 71% (24)

from (23) and the same of f,(t) as

C 10
falt) = Coa + T= Py Ci (25)

by the substitution of (24) in (13). Similarly, the parameters which are linear
compounds of f,(t) can be shown to
have their respective limiting values.

In conclusion, it may be noted that
the regression model will produce a
limiting value of F(t) only when w <0
or P< 1. Further, when w=0 or P= 1,
F(t) will keep on increasing linearly,
and its pattern of growth will be exponential when w > 0 or P> 1. This may
be verified for large t (Mitra, 1983) by
following the steps similar to those outlined in (21) and thereafter.

DISCUSSION

Since the shape of the trajectory of
F(t) and therefore of f(a,t), is completely determined by the value of P, it
follows from (20) that the convergence
of the trajectory to a limiting value is
by no means guaranteed in any projection exercise. Fortunately, the model
converges in Das Gupta’s example
with the U.S. data. It is also possible
that in the same example the model
may still converge to different limiting

values when the number of terms on
the right hand side of (1) is changed. In
that case, the different trajectories obtained in the process can be used for
generating alternative sets of population projection. However, as has been
shown in this paper, the model’s usefulness for purposes of long-term population projection remains in doubt
due to the severity of the restriction implied by the condition of its convergence.
