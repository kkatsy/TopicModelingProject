In the Fall/Winter 1995 issue of Social
Biology, Dominique Meekers entitled her
article “Immaculate Conceptions in SubSaharan Africa: Inconsistencies in the Timing of First Sexual Intercourse and First
Birth.” In the introductory paragraph, she
notes “a significant percentage of parous

first sexual intercourse. I refer to this phe

nomenon as ‘immaculate conceptions’.

 

 

This is not a proper use of the term “immaculate conceptions.” It does not refer to
“virgin births,” but, as the New Encyclopedia Britannica notes, is a “Roman Catholic
dogma asserting that Mary, the mother of
Jesus, was preserved free from the effects
of the sin of Adam (usually referred to as
‘original sin’) from the first instant of her
conception.”
