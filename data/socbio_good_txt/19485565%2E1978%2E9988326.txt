ABSTRACT: Chromosomally normal 46,X Y males can have 47,X YY male offspring as a result of
fertilization of a normal ovum by a YY spermatozoon, produced by nondisjunction in the second
meiotic division or by mitotic nondisjunction of the Y chromosome in early stages of embryonic
development of a 46, XY fetus. If such meiotic and mitotic nondisjunctions were random events and
if these were the only source of 47,X YY males in the population, the incidence of 47,X YY males
would remain constant. Two cases have been reported, however, in which 47,X YY males produced 47, X YY male offspring. If there are 47,X YY males who are asource of 47,X YY malesinthe
population, there is the possibility that the incide.:ce of 47,X YY males is changing. A discretegeneration model is presented which describes (1) the change in incidence of 47,X YY males from
one generation to the next; (2) the incidence at equilibrium; and (3) the incidence as a function of the
probability thata 47,X YY male has a 47,X YY offspring, and as a function of the mean number of

 

offspring of 47,X YY males relative to the mean number of offspring of 46,XY males.

In considering the incidence of the
47,X YY male in the population, one generally assumes that the fathers of 47,X YY
males are 46,XY males. Such 47,X YY
males may result from fertilization of a
normal ovum by a YY spermatozoon produced in gametogenesis by nondisjunction
in the second meiotic division or may be
produced by mitotic nondisjunction of the
Y chromosome in early stages of embryonal
development. If there were no systematic
variation in the frequency of occurrence of
the mechanisms by which 46,XY males
produce 47,X YY male offspring, and if all
47,XYY males were the offspring of
46,XY males, the incidence of the 47,X YY
karyotype would remain constant.

In contrast to cases of other sex chromosome variants in which sterility is the rule
(e.g., 45,X and 47,X XY), instances have

been documented in which 47,X YY males
have produced chromosomally normal
offspring (e.g., Thompson et al., 1967) and
47,X YY males (Tzoneva-Maneva et al.,
1966!; Sundequist and Hellstrom, 19692).
Viable YY spermatozoa could be produced
in the 47,X YY male by primary nondisjunction in the second meiotic division asin
the 46,X VY male or by secondary nondisjunction. These cases of 47,X YY fatherson pairs provide evidence of a second
source of 47,X YY males in the population
and raise the possibility that the incidence
of 47,X YY males is changing.

We now present a discrete-generation
model which assumes that 46,XY males
and 47,X YY males can produce 47,X YY
male offspring and which describes (1) the
change in the incidence of 47,X YY males

‘The father and son were 46,XY/47,XYY
mosaics, with the latter cell line predominating.

2 The putative father of an illegitimate 47,X YY
male had a 47,XYY karyotype. The Y/E ratios of
both males, as well as blood typing, provided evidence of paternity.

from one generation to the next; (2) the
incidence at equilibrium; and (3) the incidence as a function of the probability thata
47,XYY male has a 47,XYY offspring,
and as a function of the mean number of
offspring of 47,X YY males relative to the
mean number of offspring of 46,X Y males.
Since the model demonstrates the relationship between the incidence of 47,X YY
males and reproductive characteristics of
46,XY males in comparison to reproductive characteristics of 47,X YY males, it
delineates the kinds of data which would be
required for a better understanding of the
population aspects of the 47,XYY
karyotype.

THE MODEL

We propose a discrete-generation model
using standard modeling techniques. The
assumption of nonoverlapping generations
is commonly made in population genetics;
it yields results which can be generalized to
overlapping generations, but with a loss of
clarity. The model describes: Ap, the
change in the incidence of 47,X YY from
one generation to the next; ~, the incidence
of 47,XYY males in the population at
equilibrium; and y, the incidence of the
production of 47,X YY males by 46,XY
males. These parameters are defined as
functions ofr, the probability of a47,X YY
male having a 47,X YY offspring, and of
N,/Ne, the ratio of the mean total number
of offspring of 47,X YY males reaching reproductive age to the mean total number of
offspring of 46,X Y males reaching reproductive age.

Let the mean number of male offspring

The change in the prevalence of 47,X YY

provided estimates for r and N,/N, are

ESTIMATION OF p

The incidence of 47,X YY males is approximated by the prevalence of 47,X YY
males in randomly selected or consecutive
newborn males. Thirty-five 47,X YY males
have been detected in six samples of newborn males totaling 37,634, resulting in a
prevalence of 0.0009, or approximately 1
in 1,000 (Hook and Hamerton, 1977). If
one assumes that differences in prevalence
among the studies from different geographic areas reflect random rather than regional variation, the estimation of the incidence is based on a large sample size and
should therefore be reasonably accurate.

ESTIMATION OF 7

If the supernumerary Y chromosome of
47,X YY males segregated randomly and
gametes were equally viable, the value ofr
could be determined on the basis of probability. The four types of expected gametes
and the probability associated with each
type would be: X (1/6), Y (1/3), XY (1/3),
and YY (1/6). Accordingly, 1/6, or approximately 17 per cent, of the offspring could
be expected to be 47,X YY males. Also,
47,X YY males would be expected to produce 47,X XY offspring and twice as many

 

supernumerary Y chromosome during
gametogenesis in 47,X YY males has been
reviewed by Hultén and Lindsten (1973).
Several 47,X YY males studied had only
normal XY bivalents. However, YY bivalents have been noted in the cells of two
47,X YY males and identified by fluorescence in one case. This finding confirms
that, at least in some 47,X YY males, a
supernumerary Y chromosome can be
perpetuated throughout rather than being
eliminated from the process of gametogenesis.

One method of estimating ¢ is to determine what per cent of spermatozoa of
47,X YY males are YY-bearing. Diasio
and Glass (1970) found 5 per cent YYbearing spermatozoa in 1,000 ejaculate
spermatozoa of a 47,KX YY male. In this
subject, 70 per cent of the 1,000 spermatozoa contained one Y chromosome (or
XY) in comparison to 36 to 49 per cent in
spermatozoa of normal controls. Faed etal.
(1976) found 1.6 per cent YY-bearing
spermatozoa in 250 ejaculate spermatozoa
of a 47,X YY male in contrast to 0.8 per
cent of a normal control; Chandley et al.
(1976) found 2.4 per cent in 1,600 spermatozoa of a 47,X YY male, and Hultén
and Pearson (1971) found 2.9 per cent
Y Y-bearing testicular spermatozoa.

In contrast to the studies of 47,X YY
males, Diasio and Glass (1970) found no
YY-bearing spermatozoa in spermatozoa
of an unspecified number of 46,X Y males;
Sumner et al. (1971) found an average of
1.3 per cent of Y Y-bearing spermatozoa in
4,000 ejaculate spermatozoa of four subjects, three of whom were attending a subfertility clinic; and Pawlowitzki and Pearson (1972) found an average of 1.3 per cent
in 10,692 ejaculate spermatozoa of twelve
healthy fertile subjects. These studies
suggest that the percentage of Y Y-bearing
spermatozoa may be higher in 47,X YY

males than in 46,X Y males, but substantially lower than the 17 per cent expected if
the Y chromosome segregated randomly.
Thus, there is no evidence that the additional Y chromosome segregates randomly,
but there is evidence that it is not always
completely eliminated in the process of
gametogenesis.

Questions have been raised on optical
grounds about the validity of inferring the
presence of two Y chromosomes in
quinacrine-stained spermatozoa displaying two fluorescent spots or F-bodies
(Roberts and Goodall, 1976). The optical
attenuation coefficient is sufficiently great
that Y chromosomes located deep in the
head of spermatozoa would not be detected
and other chromosomes and _ artifacts
fluorescing less brightly than the Y located
near the surface would be detected. Interobserver variability in the intensity of
the fluorescence required for a spot to be
counted would have a significant effect on
the threshold at which other chromosomes
would become visible and on the resulting
counts of F-bodies. Initially, DNA measurements using Feulgen microdensitometry suggested that the two F-bodies
represent two Y chromosomes (Sumner et
al., 1971). More recently, DNA measurements using integrating microinterferometry indicate that DNA measurements of spermatozoa with two F-bodies
do not differ from those of spermatozoa
with one F-body, suggesting that many are
not YY-bearing (Sumner and Robinson,
1976). The incidence of 47,X YY males, 1
in 1,000, is lower than the percentages of
YY-spermatozoa feported in 46,XY
males. YY-bearing spermatozoa may not
be as viable as normal spermatozoa and/or
the percentages reported may represent
substantial overestimations due to technical problems in identifying YY-bearing
spermatozoa. In either case, it is likely that
the percentages of YY-bearing spermatozoa reported for 47,X YY males will
be overestimations of r.

Social Biology

ESTIMATION OF N,,/N,

An estimate of V,/N2, the ratio of mean
total number of offspring of 47,X YY males
to mean total number of offspring of 46,X Y
males, depends upon estimating the viability and reproductivity of 47,X YY males in
comparison to 46,X Y males. This ratio is
determined by factors such as (1) viability
of the 47,X YY fetus, (2) 47,X YY infant
mortality, (3) fertility of the 47,X YY male,
and (4) the reproductive characteristics of
47,X YY males.

To date, no47,X YY male has been identified in chromosome studies of spontaneously aborted fetuses (Boué et al., 1976),
suggesting that this chromosomal variant
does not result in a reduced fetal viability.
Longitudinal studies of 47,X VY males detected in surveys of newborns were begun
in the 1960’s, and no cases of 47,X YY infant mortality have been noted. Jacobs et
al. (1974) reported that nine of the ten
47,X YY males detected in their investigation were phenotypically normal at birth,
and that the tenth had a minor abnormality, namely, bilateral clinodactyly. In a
survey by Lubs and Ruddle (1970), two of
three 47,X YY males detected had minor
neonatal complications. At one year of age,
none evidenced developmental retardation; and at two years, all were doing well.
Valentine et al. (1971) have reported that
none of the four 47,X YY males detected in
their survey showed physical abnormalities. At four years of age, three were
normal, and one had borderline intelligence and behavioral problems. These
findings on randomly selected 47,X YY
males constitute the only direct data on the
viability of 47,X YY male infants and
suggest a probability that a 47,X YY male
will reach the age of reproduction which is
roughly equivalent to the probability for
46,XY males.

Gametogenesis has been studied in four
47,X YY males detected in a survey of a
general population (Skakkebaek, 1973), all

of whom were found to have impaired
spermatogenesis. Three of the four had reduced sperm counts resulting from the presence of tubules with spermatogenic arrest
as manifested in testicular-biopsy specimens. The fourth 47,KYY male had
tubules with complete spermatogenesis,
but with a reduced number of spermatids.
Although one of the 47,X YY males had a
son, these data on 47,X YY males who
were not detected in an institutionalized or
fertility clinic population strongly suggest
that the fertility of 47,X YY males may on
the average be lower than that of 46,X Y
males.

To our knowledge, no data have been
published on the mean number of offspring
of 47,X YY males in comparison to that of
46,X Y control males. It may be significant
that the prevalence of 47,X YY males in
mental-penal institutions is elevated. The
nature of the relationship between the elevated prevalence and the supernumerary
chromosome is unclear (Hook, 1973);
nevertheless, the possibility exists that
47,X YY males have a reduced mean

number of offspring as a function of incarceration and subsequent lack of opportunity
to reproduce.

In summary, there have been no direct
studies of the viability or reproductivity of
the 47,X YY male which would indicate
that N,/N. differs from 1. The data on
gametogenesis in 47,X YY males strongly
suggest that NV,/N. may be less than 1.
However, since this parameter has not
been systematically investigated, a range of
values of V,/N, will be assumed in the discussion of the relationship of V,/N, tof and

Y.

47,X YY males are 47,XYY if random
segregation and equal viability of gametes
are assumed. If one assumes that YY gametes have no advantage in regard to
segregation or viability, then 0.17 marks
the upper theoretical limit of r. The lower
limit is more difficult to specify without
systematic research on gametogenesis in
47, X YY males and chromosome studies of
offspring of 47,X YY males. It is evident,
however, that, for 7 equal to or less than
0.17, variations in r have very little effect
on f. When N,/N,j is less than 1 (e.g., 0.5),
as may be the case if 47,X YY males have
reduced fertility, the effect on fis even less,
as is also shown in the figure. A theoretical
implication is that if 47,X YY fetuses of
47,X YY fathers were systematically
aborted, there would be no appreciable
change in the incidence of this
chromosomal variant in the population.
Figure 2 shows the values ofy fora range
of N,/N. values from 0.0 to 2.0, for f =
0.0009 and r = 0.00, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.17.
For r = 0.00 to 0.05, y does not change
appreciably as V,/N» varies. Also, for these
values ofr and for somewhat larger values,
y = p. Thus, an intervention that would
either increase or decrease the mean total
number of offspring of 47,X YY males rela
tive to the mean total number of offspring
of 46,XY males would not appreciably
alter the relationship betweeny and #. For
example, if one assumes that the lower
limits of r and N,/N. are 0.03 and 0.5,
respectively, and that the upper limits are
0.05 and 1.5, respectively, then 0.00063 =
y = 0.00077. This example demonstrates
that, if one had accurate estimates of r and
N,/N2, y could in turn be estimated. The
resulting value of y would predict the
proportion of 47,X YY males who could be
expected to have 46,XY fathers and the
proportion of those who could be expected
to have 47,X YY fathers.

DISCUSSION

Whereas extensive research has been
addressed to determining the incidence of
47,X YY males in the population, little attention has been given to the factors which
contribute to variations in the incidence.
We have focused here on the evidence that
there may be two types of 47,X YY males in
the population, namely, those who are
offspring of 46,X Y males and those who
are offspring of 47,X YY males. In the
proposed discrete-generation model, we
have described variation in the incidence of
47,X YY males as a function of r, the frac

tion of the total offspring of a47,X YY male
which is 47,X YY, and N,/Nz, the ratio of
the mean tota) number of offspring of
47,X YY males to the mean total number of
offspring of 46,XY males. The general
conclusion which can be drawn is that,
within the probable ranges ofr and N,/No,
any reduction iny or N,/Nz has no appreciable effect on the incidence of 47,K YY
males in the population. Thus, the free reproduction of 47,X YY males has no appreciable effect on the incidence in the
population.

The proposed model draws attention to
the fact that little is known about the reproductive characteristics of 47,X YY
males. Assumptions have been made about
the ranges within which r and N,/N2 are
likely to fall, but itis possible to study these
parameters empirically. One could ascertain the mean fraction of offspring of
47,XYY males who are 47,X YY males,

47,XYY Males 93
that is, the probability thata47,X YY male
will have offspring of the same karyotype.
One could also ascertain what the mean
number of offspring of 47,X YY males is
compared to 46,X Y normal controls. Less
central to the proposed model, but of equal
interest, is the question whether 47,K YY
males have more normal male than female
offspring, and whether 47,X YY males
have 47,X XY offspring. Also, the nature
and degree of impairment of viability and
function of YY-bearing spermatozoa relative to normal spermatozoa needs to be
examined.
