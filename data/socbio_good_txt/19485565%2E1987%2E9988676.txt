ABSTRACT: Biosocial characteristics of 265 mentally retarded and 253 nonretarded children
comprising 518 handicapped children from eastern India were studied to discern characteristics significantly associated with the retardates. The children studied were consecutive referrals between January 1977 and April 1981 to the Centre for Handicapped Children, Institute
of Child Health, Calcutta. Comparison of retarded and nonretarded children showed the
incidence of mental retardation to be significantly associated with age of children, age of
mothers, parents’ socioeconomic class, family size, birth order, tempo of motor development, and family history of psychiatric iliness. The proportion of retardates was higher
among the handicapped girls than among boys, and the level of retardation was significantly
associated with sex. Implications of findings are discussed.

According to the World Health Organization (1977), the prevalence rate of
“persistent and socially handicapping”
mental health problems among children
aged 3~15 years in developing countries
is roughly similar to that estimated for
the developed countries. As far as one
of these problems, mental retardation, is concerned, the number of retarded children in India was estimated
to be 1.4 to 1.8 million in 1966 (McHale
and McHale, 1979). Official sources indicate that currently there may be at
least two million such children in the
country (Institute of Child Health and
Hospital for Children, 1980).In all age
groups an estimated 3 to 5 per cent of India’s population suffer from various degrees of mental retardation (Sen, 1976).
The Indian Planning Minister himself
expressed concern in 1984 at the level of
mental retardation among children, estimated at 0.5 to 1 per cent (Hindustan
Times, 1984).

206

Children who are, in general, exposed to disease, infection, malnutrition, poor health care and living conditions, and “‘reproductive casualty” (i.e.,
low birth weight, prematurity, pregnancy hazards, toxemia, etc.), are often victims of mental retardation. The
relationship of poverty and deprivation
to retardation is, however, associative
and not casual (Begab, 1976). According to the All India Institute of Medical
Sciences, about 1.5 million children are
born every year in India with genetic disorders (Verma, 1981). Genetic factors
are considered to have a predisposing
role in the development of mental disorders, although the precise nature and
importance of this role is not clearly
known (Coleman and Broen, 1976).

In the above context, information on
various psychosocial and biosoctal characteristics associated with mentally disordered persons is essential for a proper
understanding of the problems. There

fore, an attempt is made in this study to
gather and present information about
such characteristics for a group of
“handicapped” children from the eastern region of India. About half of
these children were mentally retarded,
and the rest showed signs mostly of
emotional disturbance and learning disability but not retardation. The major
aim of the study, within its limited
scope, is to compare the retarded children with their nonretarded counterparts to find out in which characteristics
do the former differ significantly from
the latter.

This is a fact-finding pilot study and
not an epidemiological survey. It may,
however, ultimately help develop the
“reference frame” needed for a population sample survey.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Materials for the study were derived
from the exhaustive and wellmaintained case records at the Centre
for Handicapped Children, Institute of
Child Health, Calcutta. “Handicapped
children” refers to persons 3-21 years
of age who suffer from physical and/or
mental impairments. They include
“mentally retarded, hard of hearing,
deaf, speech impaired, visually handicapped, seriously emotionally disturbed, orthopedically impaired or
other health-impaired children, or children with specific learning disabilities
who by reason thereof require special
education and related services” (GlorScheib, 1982). The Centre, however,
deals with and attends to handicapped
children primarily showing mental retardation, emotional disturbances, and
learning disabilities caused by other impairments.

Mentally Retarded Children

 

207

Of the cases considered in this study
almost all were referrals to the Centre
from the different departments of the
Institute of Child Health itself; only a
few cases were referred by the Students
Health Home and other hospitals in
Calcutta. After a clinical examination,
each case was investigated by the Centre. A detailed interview was held with
both the parents of the child to collect
the relevant background information
about the parents themselves, the family, the home, and the child.

Diagnosis of the defect was then
made and therapy prescribed after a
thorough and prolonged psychodiagnostic examination of the child. The
psycho-diagnostic appraisal consisted of
an in-depth interview with the child and
administering a battery of standard tests
for assessing intellectual functioning,
perceptual-motor development, adaptive behavior skills, emotional and social maturity, etc. All the information
obtained from interviews, clinical findings, and test results were kept in the
form of a case record.

During the four and a half-year period between January 1977 and April
1981, about 550 cases of handicapped
children (on an average, 120-125 cases
a year were attended to by the Centre.
After considering the reliability of information supplied, we selected 518 out of
the 550 cases for the study.

A few points may be noted here regarding the reliability of data and representativeness of the sample studied. In
addition to the clinical examination of a
child, necessary diagnostic tests were
carried out whenever needed. A
qualified child psychiatrist assessed the
psychiatric symptoms. The interview
with parents was elaborate and probing.
The psycho-diagnostic examination,

 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

208 Pakrasi et al.

which often spread over two days, was
conducted by one or the other of the two
trained women psychologists (S.
Chowdhury and M. Chakraborti, the
two coauthors) working at the Centre.
A uniform testing procedure was followed by both. Doubtful cases were
seen by both psychologists before a diagnosis was made. Results of interview
and testing were entered in standard record forms by the two psychologists. As
data for the present study were gleaned
from these case records, it may be reasonably assumed that such data had a reliability greater than could be attained
through a population survey.

The data had one major limitation.
Parents were asked to recollect significant events and behavior in their children’s life which had occurred some
years earlier. Information supplied,
therefore, suffered from recall lapses.
Many of the parents had no clear perception or understanding of what mental impairments could be as compared to
physical handicaps. They often failed to
seek timely help or intervention for their
affected children until the symptoms intensified and the condition deteriorated.
Such delay further suggested the problem of recall lapse.

The sample of children dealt with was
not truly a representative sample of the
handicapped child population, as it was
not obtained through any systematic
population sampling, nor did it properly
cover the entire eastern region of India.
The majority of children were -from
West Bengal, and over one-half of them
came from the Calcutta Metropolitan
District alone. The number of cases
from the adjoining states of Assam, Bihar, Orissa, and Tripura was naturally
small.

Nevertheless, the sample had certain
special merits. Though it was not a ran
Social Biology

dom sample, it was a truly consecutive
series. The Institute of Child Health is
meant solely for children, and any child
who is referred to its Centre for Handicapped Children is attended to. There ts
no scope for personal selection or rejection. Further, the records showed that
the composition and characteristics of
the sample varied little from year to
year. Keeping in view the enormous
practical difficulty in terms of time, energy, resources, and even feasibility of
conducting an epidemiological survey,
an institutional sample like the present
one may be the most feasible alternative
to a population sample, especially in a
developing country where literacy and
health-consciousness among the population are low. The data and findings
presented in the study are therefore to
be viewed in the light of these considerations.

RESULTS

For each child, basic information was
obtained on the following: (1) age; (2)
sex; (3) diagnosis of defect; (4) level of
intelligence (IQ); (5) mother’s education and age at the time of child’s delivery; (6) sociocultural group; (7) socioeconomic class; (8) family size; (9) birth
order; (10) motor development; (11)
mother’s health during pregnancy; and
(12) family history of psychiatric illness.

To get an overall idea about the sample, we first classified the 518 cases according to major variables of age, sex,
and diagnosis. Of these, 265 (167 boys
and 98 girls) were primarily diagnosed
as mentally retarded, though 87 also had
other syndromes. The remaining 253
cases (171 boys and 82 girls) were nonretardates suffering mainly from emotional disturbances and learning disabilities caused by other impairments. The

ages of these children ranged from 1
year 10 months to 16 years 2 months.
Later, 13 cases (7 retardates and 6 nonretardates) were excluded because they
were over 15 years of age. Another five
cases (retardates) were dropped because of incomplete information. The
elimination of these 18 cases resulted in
a final sample size of 500 children.

The final sample of 500 cases (consisting of 253 mentally retarded and 247
nonretarded children) was used for the
subsequent statistical analyses. A chisquare test was applied to evaluate the
significance of differences found between the two subgroups, retarded and
nonretarded, in respect to different
characteristics.

DISTRIBUTION OF HANDICAPPED
CHILDREN BY SEX AND DIAGNOSIS

The distribution (number and per
cent) of 518 handicapped children according to sex and diagnosis of defects is
presented in Table 1. The diagnostic
categories are arranged on the basis of
frequencies of cases. The following salient features may be noted: (1) a little

 

less than two-thirds of the children are
male; (2) a little more than a half of the
children are mentally retarded; (3) children with emotional disturbances constitute the second largest group (17 per
cent), followed by those who suffer
from speech and hearing defects (14
per cent); (4) in every diagnostic category, except one, the number of male
children is greater than that of female
children; (5) there are two cases of autism and one case of phenylketonuria
without retardation (certain cases of
PKU may develop normal or even superior intelligence, see Kolb, 1968;
Coleman and Broen, 1976); (6) among
male children, a little less than one-half
show mental retardation (either alone
or with another syndrome), whereas
among female children 54 per cent are
mentally retarded.

A detailed breakdown of only the
mentally retarded children is shown in
Table 2. It is seen that (1) undifferentiated mental retardation accounts for a
little more than half of all retardates and
(2) Down’s syndrome is present in 14
cases. Late maternal age is said to be asDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

sociated with the birth of Down’s syndrome children. It is interesting that for
12 of the 14 children with Down’s syndrome, mothers’ age was below 30
years; (3) there are more cases of mental
retardation with epilepsy than with any
other syndrome; (4) there are three retarded children with autism.

AGE, SEX, AND MENTAL RETARDATION

The distribution of children by sex,
age, and mental retardation is given in

Table 3. Since the sample size is small,
two-year intervals have been followed in
dealing with the age distribution. The
largest number of children are between
5.1 and 7.0 years, followed by children
7.1-9.0 years. Children between 5.1
and 11.0 years comprise 56 per cent of
the total sample. In each age group, except the youngest, male retardates exceed females. Children in the lowest age
group (3.0 years and below) account for
only 8 per cent of cases. The number of

Vol. 34, No. 3-4

retardates rises steadily up to 7.0 years
and then decreases with the advancing
ages of children.

Examination of the age distribution
(Table 4) shows that among the children
7.0 years or less nonretardates outnumber retardates, while among children 7.1
years and over there are more retardates. There is a strong association between age of the children (below or
above 7.0 years) and the number of
mentally retarded (x? = 12.75 with 1
d.f., significant at 1 per cent level).

LEVEL OF MENTAL RETARDATION

Table 6 shows the distribution of
mentally retarded children classified according to sex and levels of retardation.
Of the final sample of 500 cases, 253
were mentally retarded. Following the
standard American Association of Mental Deficiency system (Grossman,
1977), the retardates have been sorted
out under four groups, namely, mild,
moderate, severe, and profound. Since
the IQs of 7 children (5 males and 2 females) could not be measured accurately, they have been excluded, leaving
246 cases with measured JQ’s. There
were 88 cases of borderline retardation.
However, “the borderline category is no
longer labeled as borderline mental retardation, but rather as borderline intelligence”’ (Lavigne and Burus, 1981),
and such cases are not usually included
in incidence figures of mental retardation. Accordingly, these cases were
treated as nonretardates.

The distribution of 246 retardates follows the usual trend (Coleman and
Broen, 1976). By sex, profoundly retarded females are three times more numerous than males, while in the other
three groups the males outnumber the
females. Among males, the moderately

retardated constitute the largest component followed immediately by the mildly
retardated.

The chi-square test indicates a significant association between the degrees
of retardation and the sex of the children
(x? = 8.98 with 3 d.f.; significant at the 5
per cent level). Proportionately, there
are more males than females in the moderate and severe categories, while the
opposite is true in the case of mild and
profound categories.

MOTHER’S EDUCATION, AGE AT DELIVERY
AND RETARDATION OF CHILD

The World Health Organization has
pointed out that children reared by very
young mothers and those brought up in
nuclear families with very many children
are more likely to show problems in psychological development (WHO, 1977).
It is also advised that late pregnancies,
of mothers aged 30 years or more,
should be avoided to prevent the birth of
retarded children, especially those with
Down’s syndrome (Stern, 1968). Again,
better education of the mother is expected to generate greater awareness

about judicious childbearing and efficient childrearing practice in a small
family.

Table 7 gives the distribution of retarded children by mother’s education
and age at delivery. The mothers have
been considered under four broad agegroups: (1) below 20 years (teen-age),
(2) 20-24 years (young), (3) 25-29
years (adult), and (4) 30 years and
more (older). As relevant information
about age and education was not available for 27 mothers, they are excluded.

Of the 491 mothers, the teen-agers
alone account for a little less than onefourth cases, while young mothers aged
20-24 constitute the largest group. The
number is the lowest for older mothers,
over 30 years.

About 53 per cent of the mothers are
literate or have some few years schooling (Level 2). Illiterate mothers (Level
1) are present in about 1 per cent of the
cases. About 35 per cent of the mothers
are in the group with the highest level of
education (Level 3), having completed
secondary school or higher, with about
10 per cent of the educated mothers in
Level 3 being university graduates.

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

Vol. 34, No. 3-4

Among the smallest educational
group, illiterate mothers, 61 per cent
have mentally retarded children.
Among the literate or more educated
mothers, the proportion of such children varies between 48 and 50 per cent.
However, no significant association is
found between mental retardation and
level of mother’s education (x? = 3.42
with 2 d.f.).

On the other hand, the proportions
of mentally retarded children born of
mothers of different ages (disregarding
education) are observed to vary significantly. The ¢-values for the differences
between the proportions of retarded
children among the teen-aged and
young mothers, and again among the
young and older mothers are 3.19
(p <0.01) and 2.77 (p< 0.01), respectively. However, no significant difference exists between the proportions obtained among the young and adult
mothers.

SOCIOCULTURAL GROUP
AND MENTAL RETARDATION

Table 8 shows the frequencies of retarded and nonretarded children classified under two broad sociocultural
groups, namely, Bengali and nonBengali according to parentage of chil

dren. Further breakdowns of the sample
by sex and religious affiliation are shown
in Table 9. The number of children with
Bengali parentage is three times greater
than that of non-Bengali ones (Table 8).

In both the sociocultural groups the

However, the chi-square test indicates
that neither sociocultural group

incidence of mental retardation.

significant association between socioeconomic class and incidence of mental

FAMILY SIZE AND MENTAL RETARDATION

The children under study have a sibship size between 0 and 9. For the purpose of analysis, the family size has been
dichotomized as (1) small (with 1, 2 or 3

children) and (2) large (with more than 3
children). The number of retarded and

Small families are found in a little
more than two-thirds of all cases, and in
these families the proportion of mentally retarded children is less than that in
large families. The chi-square test confirms that the incidence of mentally retarded children is significantly associated with family size (x? = 5.62 with 1
d.f.; significant at the 5 per cent level).
The larger the size of family, the higher
is the incidence of retarded children.

BIRTH ORDER AND MENTAL RETARDATION

Table 12 shows the distribution of
mentally retarded children by birth order. Reported birth orders of the children range from 1 to 11. The children of
the first two birth orders constitute 71
per cent of all cases, but those who belong to Order 1 are the single major
group. A recent study in India has
shown that the first-born child is the
most frequent sufferer of mental retardation (Nanda et al., 1981).

Pakrasi and Halder (1973) observed
that in the states of East India the children maintain higher proportions in

birth orders 1 and 2 than in higher orders, and this is true for India as a whole
(U.S. Census Bureau, 1978; Agarwala,
1972; Gulick, 1971). Thus, higher occurrences of first- and second-born children
in the present study tally well with the
all-India pattern. The chi-square test
confirms that there is a significant association between the birth order of the children and mental retardation (x? = 11.64
with 4 d.f.; significant at the 5 per cent
level).

MoTOR DEVELOPMENT
AND MENTAL RETARDATION

Although the sequence of motor development is the same for all children,
the rate of development is known to be
closely associated with the intelligence
of the child (Illingworth, 1957). Based
on information on the specific age (in
months) of attainment by a child of
some gross motor development like
creeping, crawling, sitting, standing or
walking, the children have been divided
into two groups: (1) those showing a delayed tempo of development, and (2)
those showing an appropriate (timely)
development.

Table 13 gives the distribution of retarded and nonretarded children according to the tempo of motor development. In over half the cases motor
development is delayed. This delay oc

curs more frequently among the mentally retarded. Per 100 children with delayed motor development, as many as
67 are retarded, but among children
with appropriate and timely motor de

MOTHER’S HEALTH DURING PREGNANCY
AND MENTAL RETARDATION

Mother’s health during pregnancy is
very likely to influence the growth and
development of the offspring. The effect
is serious if she suffers from diseases like
anemia, hypertension, measles, small
pox, jaundice, uterine bleeding, excessive vomiting, etc. The distribution of
handicapped children by their mother’s
health during pregnancy is presented in
Table 14. Of the 500 mothers, a majority (59 per cent) reported no illness during pregnancy although a sizeable proportion of their children were mentally
retarded. Mentally retarded children
did occur in a higher proportion among
the mothers who reported being ill during pregnancy. However, no statistically

significant association between mother’s
health during pregnancy and mental retardation is found (x? = 1.76 with 1
d.f.). This finding agrees with that of
Ramanujam et al. (1969).

FAMILY HISTORY OF PSYCHIATRIC ILLNESS
AND MENTAL RETARDATION

WHO (1977)authorities have noted
that (a) variations in the psychosocial
development of children are strongly associated with the quality of parent-child
interaction, and (b) children reared by
mentally disordered parents show an increased rate of mental health problems.

In the present study, some mothers
of the handicapped children are found
to be psychiatrically ill. Information
elicited about presence of any psychiatrically ill person in the paternal or maternal side of the family does suffer in
many cases from recall lapse. Misreporting or underreporting thus puts a serious
limitation to such information. Nevertheless, the presence of psychiatrically
ill kin on the paternal side of the families
(including father) of the handicapped
children is reported in 27 per cent of
cases. The presence of such ill kin on the
maternal side (including mother) is
noted in 22 per cent of cases.

The distribution of children with and
without mental retardation by family

history of presence or absence of psychiatric illness is shown in Table 15. That
familial/hereditary factors play any
significant role among the handicapped
children under study can be inferred
with respect to family history of paternal
kin only. The chi-square test confirms
that there is a significant association between mental retardation and presence
of psychiatrically ill relatives on the paternal side (x? = 4.64 with 1 d.f. significant at the 5 per cent level); but this is
not true for the family history of maternal kin (x* = 2.55 with 1 d.f.). The findings are thus in partial conformity with
the conclusion of a previous study (Ramanujam et al., 1969).

DISCUSSION
IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY

Along with the United Nation’s special concern for the world’s disabled persons during 1981, there was a renewed
interest in India in understanding the
problems of the mentally disabled children. The present study was a direct outcome of such nation-wide interest and
activities. The study shows that in the
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 34, No. 3-4

sample of handicapped children studied
significantly more retardates (a) are in
the age group above seven years; (5) are
born to relatively young mothers; (c)
had come from low socioeconomic class
families (manual workers); (d) belong
to relatively large families; (e) are of first
and second birth orders; (f) had delayed
motor development; and (g) have a family history on the paternal side of psychiatric illness.

Of the various findings, some trends
need further study. Since mental health
problems are more common in boys
than in girls (WHO, 1977), the male
predominance among the handicapped
children in the present study conforms
with world experience. However, the
relative predominance (not the absolute
number) of retardates among the handicapped female children evokes special
interest. In a sociocultural setting
where, in general, greater family care is
lavished upon the male child, and the female child survives amidst varying degrees of deprivation and neglect, why
should proportionately more retarded
girls (54 per cent of all female handicapped) then boys (49 per cent of all
male handicapped) be brought for treatment?

It seems possible that various stressful factors have tended to increase the
risk of mental disorders in female children. However, numerically fewer
handicapped female children are, in
general, brought for proper care to Indian hospitals (Dube, 1970; Sethi et al.,
1967; Verghese and Beig, 1974). The
present sample is no exception, with
only a little more than one-third of the
cases being female children.

It is likely that in seeking medical facilities available at low cost in the Child
Hospital, the parents, though belonging
to different sociocultural groups, socio
Mentally Retarded Children 217

economic classes, and education levels,
did not discriminate between male and
female children. Otherwise, they would
not have brought proportionately more
of earlier born female than male retardates. It needs to be ascertained (1) if in
Indian society retarded female children
do actually occur in greater frequency
than retarded males, or (2) due to
changed attitudes and motivations the
retarded children of earlier birth orders,
irrespective of sex, are currently given
special attention by the parents. Again,
in a society where adolescent female
marriage, repeated motherhood, and
uncontrolled fertility still prevail to a
large extent (Government of India,
1978), it may be reasonably assumed
that both the teen-aged (below 20 years)
and the older (30 years and more) mothers are in general exposed biologically to
higher risk of “reproductive casualty”
(Begab, 1976). Could it be argued that
because of this higher risk, the mothers
of the said two extreme age groups have
borne significantly higher proportions of
mentally retarded children than are
borne by the young and adult mothers
(20-29 years)?

Compared to the major group of
Bengali parents, the minor group of
non-Bengali parents have brought to the
Hospital a relatively higher proportion
of retarded children. Certainly, it is not
to be inferred that the problems of retardation abound in the non-Bengali families. Rather, it is more likely that the
families which have sought intervention
and care for retarded children constitute
the more motivated and forwardlooking segment of the non-Bengali society at large. The afflicted non-Bengali
parents seem to be highly concerned
about the problems of management and
training of their retarded children, and
this has in turn led them to seek the

218 Pakrasi et al.

help of the hospital as early as possible.

It has been stated that scientific study
of mental disorders requires knowledge
of their social determinants (Davis,
1938). In the present paper an attempt
has been made to focus on some determinants which are appropriate to the
stratified society at large in eastern India. As observed in previous studies
(Gupta, 1970; Kaur and Sen, 1974),
here also the incidences of retardation in
children are more frequent in lower socioeconomic (manual worker) classes.
But in India families of low socioeconomic status are a large majority of the
population and they are very widely subject to a culture of poverty. Consequently, it is not unusual that the mentally retarded children from these
families would in general outnumber
their counterparts coming from the families of high socioeconomic status. Under the circumstances, one has to ponder seriously over what Begab (1976)

Social Biology

has pointed out in stating that an overwhelming majority of the retardates are
no doubt poor, but only a small portion
of these poor are really retarded. This
small portion is generally concentrated
in those families where the mothers experience poor nutrition, inadequate education, and high fertility. The root
cause of retardation in these families has
still to be specified, but depending upon
available evidences it may be said that
quality of life rather than level of income
acts as the prime determinant of mental
health problems including retardation.
