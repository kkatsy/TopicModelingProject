Demography of the Shirishana

John Fred Peters

This paper is an attempt to describe the
demography of the Shirishana of Brazil
during a fifteen-year period beginning immediately following their contact with civilization in 1957. Prior to that period, they
had lived in complete isolation from Westerners and in isolation from other Indian
tribes for at least two decades. Demographic study of the Shirishana yields
unique data on fertility and mortality of a
preliterate society, particularly during the
initial years of Western contact. Such
studies are rare because of the difficulty
in gathering such data. The demographer
is often not present to make such studies
at that crucial time of culture contact.

The Shirishana are a primitive people
located 3 degrees north latitude and 62
degrees east longitude on the Mucajai
River in north Brazil, just 70 miles south
of the Venezuelan border. There were 118
people in the tribe in 1957 when they first
traveled downstream to make contact with
civilization in an effort to obtain metal
tools (Peters, 1973). They had lived in
total isolation since 1940 or 1941 when, in
an attempt to acquire cutlasses and axes
from the semicivilized Carib Maiyongongs,
they killed ten people in a series of raids.
The Shirishana fled their area of habitation

 

 

on the Uraracoiera River and settled near
the Mucajai River.

REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE

It is only recently that demographic
studies of nonindustrial societies have become a topic of interest. Two notable exceptions are the works of Carr-Sau iders
(1922) and Krzwicki (1934). Carr-Saunders’ writings on fertility in primitive
societies can be summarized as follows:
(1) the fertility levels of primitives are
generally quite low; (2) the primitive society seeks a population level appropriate
to its resources and technology; (3) voluntary and involuntary factors such as prepubertal intercourse and prolonged lactation as well as abortion and prolonged
abstention from intercourse restrict population; (4) abortion is more frequent
among nomadic peoples because of the
difficulty of transporting more than one
suckling child. Krzwicki does not differ
basically from Carr-Saunders, although the
former’s empirical work indicates that
fewer children are born per woman in
primitive societies than in preindustrial
Europe.

More recently Ford (1945) has made
the following significant findings about

58
Vol. 21, No. 1

primitive peoples: (1) there is a universal
concern that the adult woman bear children; (2) abortion and infanticide are
performed universally, but strong social
pressures limit these practices; (3) almost
all societies attempt some method of preventing conception.

Lorimer’s work (1954) indicates a grave
deficiency in all previous studies of reproduction in nonindustrial societies, because
social factors were not adequately con
wn Sidered. Societies with wunilineal descent
S and “corporate” kinship groups were found
55 to tend to generate strong cultural motives
e for high fertility. From Lorimer’s view,
9 social disorganization might increase or de© crease fertility, depending upon the “apaS thetic acceptance of circumstances.”
During the past decade, there has been
an increased concern to relate social biological factors to demographic studies of
nonindustrial societies. Nag (1962) has
done a cross-cultural analysis of 61 socieS ties, showing that postpartum abstinence,
the period of lactation, venereal disease as
well as possibly the practice of polygny
are factors which mitigate against high
.2 fertility. His analyses do not give evidence
that early marriage, premenarcheal sexual
relations, or dietary habits affect the rate
of fertility with primitive groups. WynneEdwards (1962) focused upon the social
context in relation to population, by emphasizing social stress, superstition, availability of food, and social conventions.
In more recent works Kunstadter (1972)
and Chagnon (1972) have addressed themselves to social structure and demography
in nonindustrial societies. Kunstadter maintains that present-day primitive small
communities do not fit the classical “‘transition” theory due to the small population
and effects such as disease and availability
of medicines. Chagnon contends that social
factors, and in his case, aboriginal warfare
and threat patterns constitute a unique

social structure directly affecting the population.

Increasingly, demographers of nonindustrial societies have indicated apprehension
about generalizations from present larger
societies. Emphasis has increasingly been
toward an understanding of social factors.
It is directly in this perspective, that of
social variables affecting a primitive society, including Western contact, that this
paper has been written.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The writer first made contact with the
Shirishana in 1958 and remained as a
permanent resident in the tribe until early
1967. During this time, the language was
learned and reduced to writing, information regarding myths, legends, and folklore
was learned, and ethnological data was
recorded. Beginning in 1959, a record was
kept of all births and deaths. After the
writer’s absence, other Westerners living
with the tribe continued to record births
and deaths.

In October, 1972, the writer returned to
the Shirishana for two months of concentrated field research, during which time
he resided in the Indian communal houses.
By means of participant observation and
informant work, data was collected in regard to abortion, infanticide, births, and
deaths. Inquiry was made with respect to
causes of death, marriage, marriage separation, widowhood, sex norms, and perceptions regarding conception. Because of the
small population and the writer’s previous
acquaintance with most individuals in the
society, it was possible to extend the information to include statistics of births
and deaths beginning at the time of the
Shirishana’s first contact with Westerners
in 1957.

The birth records were used as the basis
of calculating the ages of all those born
since 1957. The time interval between all

siblings born between 1957 and 1972 was
recorded (44 spacings in 1,556 months)
and showed a mean interval of 35.3 months
(Table 1). Abortions or infanticides were
included in these statistics when known.
The 35-month sibling interval was changed

to 36 months to allow for a simple calculation of three year intervals between siblings born before 1957. Since age deference
is rigidly observed in the kin structure, it
is considered that estimated ages were
fairly accurate. Where individuals had no
living siblings, informants were able to
indicate whether the subject was older or
younger when compared to another Shirishana of approximate age.

Data on migration was determined by
recall. Informants could identify the arrival of immigrants with other specific
events such as the death of a particular
individual, or before the arrival of-a new
Western family, etc.

RESULTS
AGE-SEX DISTRIBUTION

The author constructed age-sex pyramids
for 1957, 1962, 1967 and 1972. There is
no resemblance to a stable population, except in the population under 39 years of
age in the 1972 pyramid. The trend toward
greater stability is due to three factors.
First, resident missionaries introduced penicillin and other medicines to combat disease and illness. This was particularly
significant during the Shirishana’s initial
contact, when their resistance to Western
diseases such as colds, tuberculosis, whooping cough, and measles was minimal. Second, it is believed that the ideology of the
Westerner affected abortion and female
infanticide practices. Third, there were
relatively few childbearing women in the
1957 and 1962 population. This situation
was somewhat altered by the acquisition
of non-Shirishana women into the tribe by
stealth, raids, or wife purchase.

In 1957 the sex ratio of the total population was 149; but in subsequent fiveyear periods this was decreased to 131,
119, and finally to 108 in 1972. The
reduction in female infanticide, plus an
immigration population sex ratio of 48
contributed to this balance. Between 1957
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 21, No. 1

and 1972, the total number of female
births exceeded the male births (46:40)
and the male deaths exceeded the female
deaths (31:22), also contributing to the
balance of the sex ratio. It is evident that
the age distribution and sex ratio fluctuates
considerably in a small population which
is particularly vulnerable to warfare, raids,
and disease.

GROWTH RATE

The yearly rate of natural increase has
been —5.1, 1.7, and 4.2 from 1957-62,
1963-67, and 1968-72, respectively (Table
2). The yearly growth rate has been 1.0,
2.9, and 7.3 for each of the five-year
periods, respectively. These calculations
have been made on the base population
in 1957, 1962, and 1967. The entire popuJation has increased by 58 per cent since
1957.

The first five years saw a decrease in
population due to a low birth rate because
of few women in the fertile years. At the
same time, there was a high death rate
partially due to diseases resulting from
contact with Westerners, for which the
Shirishana had little resistance. The 1963—
67 period had a more normal growth. Immigration was minimal. The 1968-72
period had a high growth rate due to
immigration, a high birth rate, and a low
death rate.

CONCEPTION AND BIRTH
The Shirishana perceives conception as
taking place at coitus. However, concep
Demography of the Shirishana

61

tion is not dependent upon the meeting of
the sperm and the egg. The sperm is simply
deposited in the vagina. Conception occurs
only through repeated acts of coitus, a
single act not being sufficient. Coitus also
is practiced during pregnancy because this
activity is thought to assure the proper
full development of the fetus. If several
men perform coitus with the same woman
and conception occurs, all the men involved are considered to be the biological
father of the offspring. Out of 100 Shirishana children and adolescents, 29 were
reported to have one father, and 71 were
reported to have more than one biological
father; in one case, seven biological fathers
were reported.

Although there is no evidence that the
fertility rate is higher where polyandry
is practiced, it is conceivable that the frequency of coitus is higher in such a marriage form. However, as already indicated,
the dominant marriage form changed from
polyandry to monogamy between 1958 and
1972.

It is said that conception can be prevented by a woman drinking a particular
liquid, or by rubbing a root upon the
woman’s abdomen, In the former case, the
woman may request the drink because she
does not want to be bothered with pregnancy or children. The drink was not
available prior to the contact in 1960
with the neighboring Marashitheli tribe.
This drink is not recommended to a nursing woman because the milk will cause the

lactating child to become ill. Sterility of
this nature can be made void through the
efforts of particular shamans.

Should a man become angry at a married man or a woman, because sex has been
denied, he may, in revenge, rub a root
upon the woman’s abdomen, supposedly
causing sterility. This behavior is considered an extremely grave offense, because
a woman’s fertility is highly valued.

Apart from these “black magic” means
of birth control, two other methods are
practiced. There is considerable postpartum
coitus restraint. An immediate subsequent
pregnancy would hinder the development
of the lactating infant. Furthermore, should
pregnancy occur, the fetus is aborted.

Data were gathered on 31 living women
in 1972, and informants indicated that a
total of 21 abortions or 0.71 abortions
per mother were performed. The majority
of these women are still in their fertile
years. Abortions are performed for three
reasons: (1) when the female is considered
to have become pregnant by an undesirable
male; (2) when pregnancy occurs before
the infant lactating is not yet two years of
age; and (3) when pregnancy takes place
when the female is still young, usually
under 15 years of age. It is believed that
early pregnancies will hinder the full development of the fetus in future pregnancies. Abortions are performed by a vigorous
hand manipulation of the abdomen or by
tramping upon the abdomen when the pregnant woman is prostrated on the ground.

Infanticide was practiced when the infant was considered abnormal, or when a
male was desired but a female was born.
Although no twins had been born since
1958, the Shirishana indicated that one of
the infants would be killed should twins
be delivered. Usually, the husband or close
relatives determine whether infanticide will
be practiced. It is expected that if the
mother has already had two consecutive
female offspring and the third is also a

Social Biology

female, the infant will be killed. The women
who bear only females are stigmatized.
Generally, a pregnant woman who has
borne only females wears a necklace or
bracelet loaned from another woman who
has given birth to several males, This practice is thought to enhance the chances of
having a male birth. There is one woman
who has had four consecutive female births
since 1960 and has not killed one. The
father of these girls, although socially pressured to kill the females at birth, adamantly
refused to do so because of a strong conviction that this would displease God. This
is directly due to the influence of the residing missionaries. The above instance
suggests that there may have been a decrease in infanticide since 1958.

When infanticide is practiced, the infant
may be thrown into the river, abandoned
in the jungle, or choked by placing a stick
across the throat and applying pressure
to the ends of the stick.

Table 1 indicates the child spacing for
all conceptions between 1957-72, including known abortions. The 44 instances of
child spacing included all ages of fertile
women and covered a range in child spacing
from 17 months (a stillbirth) to 70
months. The average spacing was 35.3
months, or approximately three years.

The Shirishana women who are married
and have borne children were placed into
four categories: young married women,
women married eight years or more, recent
menopaused women, and aged women.
These categories were chosen because some
data on infanticide and abortions are not
available for the aged; older women are
likely to have had more offspring deceased;
and younger women will have had the use
of medicines during the pre- and postnatal
periods. The estimated ages, conceptions,
offspring, the living offspring, abortions,
infanticides and stillbirths have been listed
for each woman (Table 3).

ried in early adolescence, having 21 conceptions (1.9 per female) of which 15 are
currently living (1.36 per female). The
mean age of this group is 19.6 and the age
range is 15-24 years. Three deaths, two
abortions, and one infanticide were reported.

There are eight women who have been
married at least eight years and are still
fertile. These eight women had 45 conceptions (5.6 per female) of which 31 off
springs are living (3.9 per female). The
mean age of this group is 29.75 and the
age range is 25-36. Five deaths of offspring,
seven abortions, one stillbirth, and one
infanticide were reported.

There are four in the group of recently
menopaused women. They have had 41
known conceptions (10.1 per woman) and
have 32 living offsprings (8 per female).
The mean age of the group is 46.3 and the
age range is 43-48. There was one death,

two abortions, three stillborns, and three
infanticides reported for this group.

There are four aged married women who
raised their entire family in the Shirishana
tribe. Actual data on number of conceptions, deaths of offspring, infanticides, and
abortions is not known although the author
is aware of 14 births, 7 deaths, and 3 (all
by one woman) infanticides. Because of
the women and offspring living a longer
period of time, possibility of death would
be greater than in the other three categories. The estimated average age of the
mothers is 63 years with a range between
59 and 68.

This table indicates that the number of
living offspring per married female has increased since the presence of the Westerner, very likely due to the availability of
medicines. There is some evidence of a
decreasing rate in infanticide. Actual frequency of infanticide among the aged
women is difficult to obtain, and the figures
used in Table 3 are considered conservative. It is felt that the Western ideological
stance of the value of human life, regardless of sex, has contributed to a decrease
in the frequency of infanticide. Although
the accessibility of medicines for the Shirishana has prolonged life and presumably
reduced the infant mortality rate, the
exposure to Western diseases, often acquired from Brazilians living downriver,
has shown its toll on the death rate.

MARITAL PATTERNS AND FORMS

It is rare to find a female over six years
of age who is not already promised in
marriage to a male. Marriage takes place
some months after a female has passed
puberty. There is no ceremony.

The female expresses great fear of coitus
during early marriage, but is encouraged
by her mother not to resist the sexual
desires of her husband. At the same time,
the girl is not to become pregnant because

Social Biology

she is considered extremely young (usually
13 or 14 years). Early pregnancies are
said to harm the development of the fetus
in future pregnancies.

The male is usually considerably older
than the female spouse. Table 4 indicates
the age of the living or first spouse. There
is an age range of the husband being 49
years older than his wife, to the rare reverse extreme of the wife being 25 years

older than the husband. The average age
difference is 12.7 years; the standard deviation, 13.97. In almost all cases, the marriage takes place some four to sixteen
months after menarche. Currently, the men
are usually between 18 and 24 years in age
at marriage, although in one extreme case
the husband was 60 years old. Age difference between husband and wife is often
greater where the wife has been acquired
in a raid, More recent marriages, especially
where bride service is involved, show less
difference in age between the spouses. The
only two known exceptions where the females were not married shortly after
puberty occurred when the two eligible
men in the tribe proved inappropriate because of hostility between the families.
The women eventually married men from
another tribe some six years later.

In 1957 there were 14 polyandrous, one
polygynous, and two monogamous marriages; in 1972, there were one polyandrous,
two polygynous, and 34 monogamous marriages. When there is a great age difference
between the spouses, there is high possibility of polyandry occurring. Even in the
monogamous unions, coitus outside of the
union is socially permissible between the
wife and the husband’s brother.

Table 5 indicates the marriage form and
known extramarital associations of women
who have been married between one and
seven years, and more than seven years.
This categorization was made because if
the marriage form is to change during the
woman’s fertility, it will likely have taken
place during the first seven years of marriage. In the group that had been married
seven years or more by 1972, two women
were polygynous, one having had rare and
one having had no other sexual relationships. The fact that the husband of this
polygynous union was a powerful shaman
may have contributed to the relative high
fidelity. Seven women were monogamous,

two of whom had frequent other sexual
relationships, two had rare encounters, and
three had virtually no encounters. Factors
relating to fidelity were the number of
eligible males, the beauty and seductiveness of the female, and the suitor’s fear of
the husband. Of the women married for
more than seven years, eleven had been
polyandrous, that is, had at least two men
at one time cohabitating with them. In
all cases, sexual relations with other men
had been frequent.

Among the more recently married, one
woman was polyandrous and had no other
sexual unions. Two women were polygynous and had rare or no other sexual relationships. Eighteen women were monogamous; two had frequent, four had rare,
and twelve had no sexual relationships
with other men. Monogamy is much more
common among younger women. Polyandry
has generally been fraternal and has generally occurred only after two or three
children have been born.

The data gathered in field research suggest that approximately eight or nine
months may pass before a marriage is likely
to “stick.” In one such brief union, the
male was small in stature, and reportedly
afraid of having coitus with his rather
stout wife. In two cases, younger brothers
of the initial husbands forced the termination of the unions by means of their
amorous behavior and acquired the women
as wives. In two other cases, the women
simply did not desire the men, and so left
them. In another instance, the husband
died before the girl’s menarche. The father
then gave the girl to a young man who was
making bride price for a younger daughter.
The older girl refused coitus with this man,
had a series of relationships with other
men, aborted at least twice, and eventually
fled from the tribe (Peters, 1971). She is
now considered sterile.

Marriages initially appear to be somewhat fluid in nature. The spouses may
separate after several months of cohabitation, even though months or years of bride
payment and bride service have been made.
Since 1965 there have been nine separations involving 14 males and females. Five
individuals were still single in 1972, although three of these five had marriage
prospects. The birth of a child or of children seem to assure the permanence of
young marriages. Polyandrous marriages
may become monogamous if one of the
husbands acquires a new wife. Any marriage could be terminated when the female
reaches menopause.

If a widower is young, he is likely to
remarry. Widows remarry only if they are
still considered fertile, and if there are
eligible men available. If the deceased husband was a powerful shaman, his wife may
be permitted to marry only his surviving
brothers. Otherwise, his spirits would kill
his widow. Widows and widowers still experience coitus without marriage. Middle
Social Biology

aged widows often become desirable mates
for younger single men, who seek coitus
but not marriage. There is no social stigma
against a child born to a widow under
these conditions.

A woman who has been acquired through
raids is frequently raped in the new community by a number of men, particularly
if she is young and attractive. Fights between the men erupt. These sexual relations diminish as one male lays specific
claim and shows jealousy toward the
woman.

Children that have been born because
of polyandrous or other culturally acceptable sex relationships are nurtured by the
mother, as well as by the recognized fathers.
Even though the progenitor may not reside
with the mother, he still may bring game
or fish to the mother to cook for his offspring. During times when the child is
sick, he will feel responsible to provide
adequate food.

MIGRATION

Although there was no immigration between 1941 and 1959, immigration in subsequent years had a marked effect upon
the age-sex composition in the population.
The immigration for the 1960-72 period
was 35 and consisted of a sex ratio of 48
for the total immigrant population. Sixteen
of these women came as wives for Shirishana men and were of the age of high
fertility, thus contributing almost immediately to the natural growth of the population. Ten others had not yet reached
puberty at the time of immigration and
therefore would eventually contribute to
the natural growth rate. Other immigrants
were three single men marrying Shirishana
women and some younger members of
nuclear families.

Of the 18 female immigrants who entered the tribe since 1960 and were immediately married to Shirishana men, seven

were purchased, eight were taken captive
in raids, two were stolen, and one was
given to avenge a Shirishana male. During
the first five-year period, immigrant women
produced two offspring. During the subsequent years, the accumulated total was
9 and 27 respectively. Since the majority
of these women were below 30 years of
age, they will continue to contribute substantially to the natural growth of the
population.

There has been one case of emigration,
a female of 22 years of age. Her espoused
husband died when she was 10 years of
age. She disliked the husband subsequently
given her (Peters, 1971) and was later in
Demography of the Shirishana

volved with several other men. Then, likely
because of social pressure, she left for the
neighboring Aicas.

DEATHS

Four informants were asked to state the
cause of death of 47 of the 53 members of
the tribe. Their responses are indicated
in Table 6.

A total of 21 deaths were either entirely
or partially attributed to spirits. This number represents 45 per cent of the total
deaths investigated. Individuals who consider themselves cursed by a spirit resign
themselves to death, showing no effort to
regain health. In the event that the death
is considered due to enemy witchcraft, as
was reported to be the case in at least 13
instances, the desire for revenge stimulates
further possible deaths.

Table 7 shows average age at time of
death by sex in five-year periods. Except
for the 1968-72 period, more males have
died than females. The females have died
at a younger age than have the males in
the 1963-67 and 1968-72 periods.

During the fifteen-year period, there
have been two cases of infant mortality
in each of the five-year periods of research,
These six cases are insufficient to do any
analysis on infant mortality rates.

Table 8 indicates frequency of mortality
by year and life stage. The death rate is
calculated using 1957, 1962, and 1967 as
a base, respectively. The first five-year
period had a high percentage of deaths in
the old-age (45-74) and later adulthood

(25-44) categories. The 1968-72 period
had a very high frequency of deaths of
children six years of age or younger, most
of whom died rather suddenly. In one unusual case, a four-year-old Aica immigrant
of a few months was shot, simply because
he irritated another twenty-year-old Aica
who had immigrated ten years previously.
This table does not show the age-specific
death rate. The impact of the presence of
Westerners has helped reduce the death
rate from 42 in the 1957-62 period to a
death rate of 16.3 in the 1962-72 period.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

The Shirishana could not be considered
a stable population during the time of the
research. The sex ratio was high, and the
percentage of fertile women was low in
1957, mitigating against any sizeable population growth. The initial contact with
Brazilians and North Americans exposed
the population to diseases for which they
had little resistance, further limiting population growth. On the other hand, the availability of penicillin and other antibiotics
reduced the death rate considerably. Although there is no conclusive evidence, it
is believed that the high rate of infanticide
and abortion has decreased since Western
contact. Because of the resident missionaries’ efforts to contact other tribes, the
Shirishana were introduced to other groups.

Social Biology

With the access and availability of Western
goods, wives were purchased or stolen, and
in some cases, villages were raided. These
and other nonviolent forms of migration
contributed much to the percentage of
fertile women among the Shirishana.

There were not enough post-menopause
women in the variant forms of marriage
to determine whether polyandry has any
significant relationship to rate of fertility.
There is also no evidence that magical
forms of birth control are effective. Cultural beliefs about conception may affect
fertility, in that single acts of coitus are
said not to cause conception. Postpartum
practices of sexual avoidance do prevent
a high fertility.

A contrast of the population pyramid of
1957 and 1972 indicates a closer approximation to a stable population in the 1972
year period. Had the Shirishana been victims in raids, or had they not themselves
raided, the pyramid would have been considerably altered. Primitive societies which
do not exceed 200 in number fluctuate considerably due to raids and political alliances (Chagnon, 1972), the sex ratio, the
availability and use of medicines, and the
desire for Western goods.

The research confirms Lorimer’s position
(1954) that populations in nonindustrial
societies cannot be adequately comprehended unless social factors are understood.

Among the Shirishana, this has particular
reference to the customs of abortion, infanticide, magical means of contraception,
marriage form, kinship structure, and eligible marriage partners, raiding, and the
use of black magic in causing deaths.
Furthermore, Lorimer also alludes to circumstances which lead to social disorganization such as war and Western contact.
This research affirms Nag’s study (1962)
indicating the effect on population growth
wn produced by sexual abstinence during the
S period of lactation. Nag found that only
the Yap population in his sample of 61
'e nonindustrial societies was significantly
3 affected by practices of infanticide. The
A Shirishana are another.

rather than two households as in 1958. I
suggest that the social structure is the
prime variable in such segmentation. This
area requires further research.

The application of the demographic transition theory to small nonindustrial societies requires further modification. The
first period is not considered as being high
in births, as recorded for preindustrial Europe (Kundstadter, 1972; Neel, 1970).
The second period, during which the birth
rate remains relatively the same but the
death rate decreases considerably, is dependent upon such factors as degree of
exposure to nonindigenous diseases, availability of medical facilities, and the social
organization of the primitive society.
