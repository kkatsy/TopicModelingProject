ABSTRACT: This study evaluates the impact of the Trivers-Willard (T-W) effect on human
populations, using demographic data collected from vital registration data in Venezuela. The
evaluation of the sex ratio at birth (SRB) and of fetal and infant deaths supports the existence
of T-W effect in the Venezuelan population in extreme conditions. This T-W effect was observable in the SRB but not at later ages and is related to the marital status of the mother. The results
indicate that the investment in females associated with environmental adversity is greater than
the investment in males associated with good environmental conditions.

Parental investment is ‘‘any investment by the parent in an individual offspring that increases the offspring’s
chance of surviving . . . at the cost of
the parent’s ability to invest in other
offspring” (Trivers, 1972). Trivers
(1972) proposed that parents could invest differentially by sex according to
their resource predictability, parents
with better resource predictability
could invest more in the sex with
higher reproductive variance. In humans, departures from equal investment by sex are possible for groups of
different socioeconomic status (SES),
which is an indicator of resource predictability (Trivers, 1972; Trivers and
Willard, 1973). Therefore, parents
with higher SES may invest more in
sons, and parents with lesser SES may
invest more in daughters.

Trivers and Willard (1973) proposed
that a given correlation between human sex ratio at birth (SRB) with socioeconomic status was a confirmation
of their prediction. To evaluate the impact on a population of this effect, the

amount of the sex ratio deviation must
be taken into account at birth or at any
other moment during the lifespan of an
individual from conception to death, to
detect the age when differential investment exerts its effect on the survival
of the offspring. If T-W effect poses a
high population impact, a significant
distortion of demographic indicators
should be observed when comparing
for different socioeconomic indicators.

The sex ratio equilibrium depends
on the relative costs of each sex and
their mean reproductive success
(Fisher, 1930). The departures of this
equilibrium within a population can respond to ecological strategies to maximize the reproductive success of different sectors (Trivers, 1972). This
work will not focus on the central tendency of the sex ratio in a population,
but on its deviations.

The evaluation of the sex ratio at
sperm maturation, survival of the
sperm, and conception can be very
hard to accomplish in practice (Bean,
1990; Fiala, 1980; Martin, 1990). Sex

biases in fetal mortality during the first
stages of gestation can be very difficult
to measure, given the possibility of
early losses passing unnoticed. Nevertheless, sex biases at birth and mortality through perinatal, infant, child, and
adolescent periods can be easily measured from the vital registration data
that is normally recollected through
the population offices of several countries.

Evidence from several species supports the Trivers-Willard (T-W) hypothesis (Austad and Sunquist, 1986;
Blaffer-Hrdy, 1988; Clutton-Brock et
al., 1982, 1984, 1986; Gosling, 1986;
McClure, 1981). Even apparent departures from the T-W prediction can be
explained as special characteristics of
the social structure or mating arrangements of that species, which explain
the convenience of the reallocation of
resources according to other criteria
(Altmann et al., 1988; Gomendio,
1990). Nevertheless, in humans, rela
tively few efforts have been made to

test directly the T-W hypothesis although indirect evidence exists
(Clutton-Brock et al., 1985, 1986; Trivers and Willard, 1973).

Several studies have evaluated the
differential parental investment for sex
in humans, strongly suggesting its existence. From eleven authors who reported their results evaluating directly
the T-W effect, nine presented significant effects in the predicted direction,
and the other two had not controlled
relevant variables or had wrong mechanisms for hypothesis testing (Brittain
et al., 1988; Chagnon, 1979). The results of the studies that point to a T-W
effect in humans present evidence of
sex biases in mortality and sex biases in
allocating resources and care.

SEX BIASES IN MORTALITY

a.—Dickemann (1975, 1979) reported a higher incidence of female infanticide and a higher sex ratio (more
males than females) in upper socioeconomic levels of some European and
Asian famili¢s between the sixteenth
and nineteenth centuries, especially in
India, and related it to other behaviors
that conferred a reproductive strategy
to maximize reproductive success of
higher status families;

b. —Parents report greater bereavement at the death of a healthy male in
comparison with the death of an unhealthy male or a daughter (Littlefield
and Rushton, 1986);

c.— Voland (1988) reports the presence of differential mortality by sex
in Germany during the seventeenth,
eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries,
finding that land-owners were the only
ones not showing a higher male infant
mortality;

d.—Contemporary North American society presents a higher male
postneonatal mortality in all socioeconomic levels, but this higher male mortality is less marked at increased educational levels of both parents and
changes with the mother’s age. Married women have less marked male infant mortality than women without a
stable pair-bond (Abernethy and Yip,
1990).

SEx BIASES IN ALLOCATING RESOURCES
AND CARE

a. —Fifteenth and sixteenth-century
Portuguese nobility allocated economic resources differentially by sex
and by relative nobility position. This
allocation was related to the reproductive success of these societies, where
the females of the lower nobility, reVol. 43, No. 3-4

ceiving dowries, and the males of the
higher nobility receiving estates, outreproduced their counterparts (Boone,
1986);
b.—Ifalukese higher status males
spend more time with their sons and
lower status males spend more time
with their daughters (Betzig and
Turke, 1986);
c.—Contemporary North American
— society leaves legacies only in higher
a echelons of society, and legacies for
2 2 males are of a higher amount than
E those for females (Smith et al., 1987);
d.—The parents of the Mukogodo
tribe (Cronk, 1989, 1991), one of the
poorest neighbors of East African populations, may invest more milk and resources for medical attention in female
infants, which have higher reproductive success than their brothers, and
they have a female-biased sex ratio between birth and 4 years of age.
e.—North American mothers of
higher SES have a higher probability of
= supplying maternal milk to males and
= wait time for the next child when a
5 male was born, while mothers of lower
@SES have a higher probability of
y breastfeeding females and have longer
'g birth spacing for the next child when a
‘e girl was born previously (Gaulin and
= Robbins, 1991). The presence of a res© ident partner with the mother exerts a
higher effect in the parental investment
than income (a SES indicator), suggesting that psychological support may
be very important (Gaulin and Robbins, 1991).

EVIDENCE AGAINST THE T-W EFFECT

Chagnon et al (1979) presented evidence against the T-W prediction from
Yanomami society, given the fact that

Sex Ratio

259

although the leaders of the tribes had
nearly double the reproductive success
of other males, they did not present
any sex ratio bias in their living children. Nevertheless, this work has not
taken into account that there may be
an absence of correlation between the
fathers and the offspring characteristics, as these men have several wives
and their relative higher resource predictability might not be at the disposition of the individual offspring. In fact,
a higher correlation between females’
resource predictability and the sexratio of their children (Trivers and
Willard, 1973), would be expected in
polygamous societies.

Brittain et al. (1988) found no correlation between mortality sex ratio
bias and economic change. Nevertheless, they did not explore the association between the socioeconomic strata
of their population and the sex ratio,
but they compared the sex ratio according to the economic indicators of
the French West Indian population
along the years. The sex ratio biases of

the populations are related to the rel
ative costs and reproductive success of
each sex as it has been presented by
other authors (Fisher, 1930; Myers,
1978). Trivers and Willard (1973)
make predictions about the dispersion
of this central tendency or equilibrium
point within the populations, not about
the total sex ratio value of the population, which means that these types of
hypotheses are complementary and do
not contradict each other (Oksanen,
1981).

One argument presented against the.
T-W effect (Johansson, 1984; Brittain
et al., 1988) suggests that very poor
societies present a high incidence of
female infanticide. Nevertheless, the

studies that compared female infanticide within the Bangladesh population
during a famine between 1974 and 1975
(Bairagi, 1986) and infant mortality
statistics (Bhuiya et al., 1989; Das
Gupta, 1987) found a selective disadvantage for female children in richer or
higher-educated strata of the societies.
Thus, here a higher SES could improve
female infant nourishment conditions
in more educated sectors of the population (Bairagi, 1986), but it did not, as
is predicted by the T-W effect.

The evolutionary causes for behaviors need some possible proximal
mechanism to explain the mechanisms
of action of that evolutionary cause
(Wilson, 1975). The proximate mechanisms for the T-W effect in humans
can be physiological, behavioral, or
both (Cronk, 1991; Gaulin and Robbins, 1991).

Socioeconomic indicators and psychological well being, as well as hormonal equilibrium, can be very important and related to different aspects of
human behavior (Cronk, 1989). In humans, evidence points to the importance of hormonal equilibrium for sex
ratio of the offspring (James, 1987,
1989, 1990a, 19905). Physiological and
behavioral proximate mechanisms
could affect the offspring before and
after birth and could act through the
mother and the father, although Trivers and Willard (1973) suggested that
the mother should be responsible for
the differential investment effect. After birth there can exist also behavioral
differences between the sexes for allocating resources like feeding, medical
attention, access to education, or any
other resource that could be invested
differentially (Bairagi, 1986; Chen et
al., 1981; Cronk, 1989, 1991; D’Souza

Chacon-Puignau and Jaffe

Social Biology

and Chen, 1980; Fix, 1990; Nadarajah,
1983).

Clutton-Brock and Iason (1986)
have proposed that hormonal mechanisms mediated by environmental conditions may be-responsible for the sex
ratio variation. After birth, proximate
mechanisms could be related to hormonal changes after psychological and
physiological distress in the mother
(Gaulin and Robbins, 1991) affecting
milk production or psychological welfare. It has been proposed that milk
production diminishes with psychological distress (Huffman and Lamphere,
1984). Nevertheless, the sex ratio relationship with hormone levels changes
between species. The same hormone
may have opposite effects on the SRB
in different species (James, 1989).
None of the behavioral or physiological changes needed for the differential
investment need to be conscious, not
even in the human species, to have
some populational impact (Gaulin and
Robbins, 1991).

In this paper we explore in a crosssectional study the differences in the
sex ratio at birth (SRB), and fetal and
infant deaths (males/total births) between sectors of the Venezuelan population, evaluating then the population
impact of the Trivers-Willard effect.
Some evidence indicates that the marital status of the woman influences the
potential parental investment that can
be allocated to the offspring (Abernethy and Yip, 1990; Gaulin and Robbins, 1991). Moreover, legal and consensual unions show differences in
partner selectivity (Jaffé and Chac6nPuignau, 1995), pair stability (Ebanks
and Loaiza, 1989; Potter and Ojeda,
1982), and indicators of pair interaction such as coital frequency (Ebanks

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 43, No. 3-4

and Loaiza, 1989). This evidence
points to the need for evaluating the
SES effect on SRB differentially, according to the couple’s marital status.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This study used the 1988 and 1990
Venezuelan death and birth registers,
respectively. These data were provided
by the Venezuelan Central Office of
Statistics and Information (OCEI),
which stores, checks, and organizes the
information, which is highly reliable
according to internal consistency measures.

The data on fetal and infant deaths
(N = 87,229) included information
about gestational time (fetal deaths) or
age of the child, place of medical attention (hospital or clinic), presence or
absence of medical attention at the moment of death, birth order, number of
previous dead siblings, age, and educational and occupational level of the
mother.

The birth registers (N = 577,976)
included information regarding marital
status of the mother and years of relationship between parents, place of
birth, medical assistance during birth,
type of birth, birth order, number of
previous fetal deaths, parents’ ages,
educational and occupational levels. A
comparison of both parents’ ages, education, and occupational levels was
also included, with three categories for
each (man with a higher level than
woman, equal levels for both parents,
or woman with a higher level than
man) and the type of pair according to
the literacy of both members (both literate, both illiterate, woman illiterate,
or man illiterate).

Marital status was classified as: mar
Sex Ratio

261

ried (legally established couples), unmarried (couples living together without marriage), and single (women who
do not live with the father of their
child).

Educational level was classified in
four categories: did not finish primary
school, finished primary school, did
not finish high school and finished high
school or higher education. Occupation was classified according to the educational level needed to perform the
task: white collar worker, clerical, blue
collar, and home or no occupation.

The data were processed initially using an IBM-4381 mainframe and further processing was made through the
SPSS software package and specially
designed calculus work sheets in personal computers.

We used a stepwise discriminant
analysis to evaluate the influence of the
variables studied on the probability of
the child born being a male or a female. This procedure allowed us to
control for the high correlation that exists between several of the variables of
the study (parents’ ages, education,
and occupational levels). The first discriminant analysis included mother’s
marital status. After finding significant
results for this variable, separate discriminant functions were performed
for each marital status (single, unmarried, and married mothers).

We report the sex ratios at birth for
the categories of all the variables used
in this work, including those that entered in the discriminant analysis, and
the percentage of deviation of this sex
ratio from the “global” sex ratio for
each marital status. A univariate comparison for every variable is also presented, with the chi-square significances of association tests.

RESULTS

The sex ratio at birth (number of
male births/number of total births =
SRB) for the Venezuelan population
was 0.5124, which coincides with the
usual levels, that are around 0.5098
and 0.5169 (Teitelbaum, 1972; Chahnazarian, 1988) and is almost identical
to the sex ratio reported for Venezuela
by other authors using independent databases (0.5127, Feitosa and Krieger,
1992).

The first stepwise discriminant analysis over the SRB yielded a significant
result (Wilk’s lambda converted to chisquare = 57.416, df = 7; p<0.0001)
and included the marital status of the
mother, which allowed us to perform
separate discriminant analysis for the
three marital status categories. The
SRB for married and cohabiting (unmarried) mothers was very similar
(0.512 and 0.514, respectively), but
lower for single women (0.508).

The discriminant functions for the
three marital status categories were all
significant (Table 1) for the different
variables studied and explained in all
cases small but significant percentages
of the variance in the SRB. The biological and sociodemographic variables
evaluated share a higher percentage of
the variance with the sex of the new
born for single compared to married .

and unmarried mothers, suggesting
that the T-W effect may be more powerful in women who do not live with a
male partner.

From the 15 variables included in
the discriminant functions, six were
entered for the married couples, seven
for the unmarried couples, and eight
for single females (Table 2). Only
birth’s cohort size and number of born
children entered all the marital statuses’ discriminant functions, suggesting that these variables are consistently
related to sex ratio. Other variables
differed according to marital status
(Table 3). None of the other variables
that entered the discriminant functions
were shared by unmarried and single
mothers. Medical assistance and type
of pair according to literacy entered in
the two discriminant analysis functions
for mother’s cohabiting with a partner,
married or not. Mother’s education
and occupation entered the married
and single parents’ discriminant functions. None of the father’s characteristics entered the single or married status
functions.

Most of the variables that entered
the discriminant functions also presented significant associations with the
chi-square evaluation. Nevertheless,
results differed according to the type of
statistical evaluation. The results of the
variables that entered the discriminant

function and presented significant deviations with the chi-square analysis indicate that the SRB increases

—for married mothers, when it is not a
multiple birth, with medical assistance,
when the mother has a high educational
level, and when both parents are literate;

—for unmarried mothers, where the
birth corresponds to the first child with
medical assistance during delivery,
when the father has completed a high
educational level and is relatively
young, and when both parents are literate and of similar ages;

—for single mothers, when the birth is
for the first child in relationships less
than one year in length, and when the
woman has completed at least high
school.

The percentage of deviation from
the sex ratio of the population varied
little, although significantly, with a
maximum deviation of —6.77 for those
pairs where the mother is married and
having a multiple birth. The negative
deviations are larger in magnitude than

the positive deviations, their mean
value being —1.352 compared to 0.728
for the positive ones (t value = 7.01;
p <0.001).

There is heterocedasticity in the
SRB deviations when comparing data
for the three marital statuses (BarttletBox’s F=5.899; p=0.003). The
higher range of dispersion was found
for the SRB’s of single women
(-—5.1670 to + 4.1140) and of married
mothers (—6.777 to +1.923) in comparison with unmarried mothers
(-2.765 to +2.214).

The sex ratio of fetal deaths was
0.562 and for infant deaths was 0.574.
There were no differences in these sex
ratios for any of the SES indicators.
Differences were found for type of
birth and gestational time for the fetuses, presenting a higher male mortality for single births (0.565) and early
gestational times (0.593). Infant deaths
presented a higher sex ratio for mothers between 30 and 34 years of age

“Sex ratio at birth. percentage of deviation from mean sex ratio for that marital status. and chi-square significance of the association

between the sex ratio and the variable.

DISCUSSION

The secondary sex ratio (0.5124)
and the stillbirth sex ratio (0.5621)
found were almost identical to those
reported for the Venezuelan population by previous studies that used different databases (0.5127 and 0.5620,
respectively) (Feitosa and Krieger,
1992). This agreement, and the organization and quality control of the data
by OCEI and by us suggests that the
database was highly reliable for these
analyses.

All the conditions necessary for the
T-W effect to appear are present in the
Venezuelan population:

1.—There are deviations from the
equilibrium point of the sex ratio ac
cording to SES indicators, i.e., some
parents have a higher probability of having males and others have a higher prob- .
ability of having females.

2.— Variance in reproductive success
is higher for males than for females in
contemporary Venezuelan populations
(Jaffé et al., 1993);

3.—The survival probability and potential reproductive success of children
may be predicted by parents’ SES and
by children’s health indicators,

The results from the univariate and
multivariate methodologies are different signaling the importance of multivariate approaches to control for the
effects of correlation between the data.
The results for mothers of all marital
Statuses coincide with/the TriversWillard prediction, as follows:

266

1.—Miultiple births imply less investment than single births, given the higher
morbidity and mortality risk for the
newborn;

2.—The absence of medical assistance and at least one parent’s illiteracy
is an indicator of extreme poverty,
which is associated with lower SRB;

3.—Higher educational level of both
parents is associated with higher SRB;

4.—A first child with a young father
(for unmarried pairs or single women)
or from a mother in a very recent relationship (single women) can receive a
higher amount of: parental investment,
as the reproductive period is just beginning;

5.~—Similar socioeconomic conditions between both members of the pair
(unmarried couples) can improve the
stability of the couple, raising the potential paternal investment in the future.

Besides providing evidence for the
possible existence of the TriversWillard effect at birth in the Venezuelan population, and the similarity of
the results with previous reported associations for SRB (Chahnazarian,
1988; James, 1989, 1990a, 1990b), our
data point to other interesting phenomena which are not directly included in the original T-W considerations:

1.—The T-W effect on differential
sex survival in this population exerts its
effects very early, previous to conception or during the development before
birth;

2.—There is a very high stability of
the sex ratio in the population;

3.—Negative effects of socioeconomic status on SRB are of higher magnitude than positive ones;

4.—The Trivers-Willard effect differs according to the type of marital status of the woman, which can be an indicator of potential paternal investment.

Chacon-Puignau and Jaffe

Social Biology

Fetal and infant mortality indicated
no effect on SRB for any of the socioeconomic indicators, different from
what has been observed in contemporary North American society (Abernethy and Yip, 1990). The only effect
observed was that fetal sex ratio was
higher for earlier pregnancy times. It is
possible that the differential parental
investment exerts its effect on mortality before delivery, very early during
the development period or before
conception, given the relatively high
amount of energy invested before
birth. Differential mortality should occur early in the period of parental investment (Maynard Smith, 1980). This
finding implies that evaluating the sex
ratio distortion in North American society could be very helpful in understanding the results of differential
mortalities (Abernethy and Yip, 1990),
given the possibility of a higher impact
of the T-W effect in this group. It is
also possible that there exists differences in the type of data evaluated, or
in reporting procedures.

The stability of the SRB is evident,
since only small percentages of change
are observed, even in relatively extreme conditions. Moreover, the negative deviations of the sex ratio according to socioeconomic indicators are
of higher magnitude than the positive
ones, suggesting that environmental
adversity leads to an investment in females that is greater than that in males
occasioned by environmental advantage.

It is possible that in Western contemporary cultures the Trivers-Willard
proposition exerts its effect through
sex biases in allocation of resources
(favoring males) in good socioeconomic conditions and sex biases in

mortality or differential probability of
birth (favoring females) in extreme
poverty conditions. This hypothesis is
also supported by Abernethy and
Yip’s results (1990), where higher male
mortality is less marked at increased
educational levels of both parents and
of married women. This proposition
means that in extreme poverty conditions, the T-W effect leads to higher
birth or survival probability for females; in very good conditions, resource allocation for males is enhanced.

This stability of the SRB is more
pronounced in unmarried mothers
compared to married and single mothers, according to ranges of dispersion
and canonical correlation of the SRB.
Results indicate that the T-W effect on
SRB varies according to the mother’s
marital status. Being single reduces the
probability of bearing a male, in comparison with mothers cohabiting with a
male (married or not), and implies a
higher association of socioeconomic
factors with the sex of the child.

This higher relationship between
socioeconomic indicators and a male
birth probability for single mothers can
be related to the fact that single women
can be expected to depend in their
rearing activities more on themselves
than on their partners, and thus, socioeconomic factors are more important.

This finding coincides with findings
of previous studies where single mothers had a lower mean lactating time for
males than the mothers with a coresident male (Gaulin and Robbins, 1991)
and with the results that indicate that
the relative female advantage at infant
survival was higher when the mothers
were not married (Abernethy and Yip,
1990) in contemporary societies. Thus,

the economic and psychological support of a cohabiting male in Western
culture appears to be important.
Nevertheless, results for married
and unmarried mothers differ, and that
is probably related to the relative
amount of parental investment that
mothers might expect from their partners and from themselves. The father’s
characteristics entered the discriminant functions only for the SRB of unmarried mothers, indicating that the
relative investment that these partners
can provide is relevant when the
mother has a coresident male, but the
union is not legally established, i.e.,
she expects little or no support from
her partner as in single women. Age
similarity, which can be an indicator
of pair stability as it reflects higher age
assortativeness, entered to predict the
SRB for unmarried pairs, indicating
that the stability of the pair can be relevant for future investment, as it has
been reported that consensual unions
are less stable in time (Ebanks and
Loaiza, 1989). Thus, as Trivers and
Willard (1973) predicted, the mother’s
characteristics are more important for
the differential parental investment,
but the presence of a father and his
possibilities of support seem to be important, especially when he is present,
but the union is not legally established.
The higher dispersion in the SRB
deviations found for married couples in
comparison with unmarried ones can
be related to the characteristics of the
type of pair and deserves further attention. This dispersion could be related
to the differences found between these
types of union in selectivity, stability,
and reproductive success. It is possible
that socioeconomic factors can exert
their effects on the relationships in a

268

more accentuated way in couples that
may stay together during times of low
pair cohesion (married couples) due to
legal conventions than in couples that
stay together without any legal procedure (unmarried mothers).

The fact that the presence of a male
cohabiting with the female and the stability of the pair bond has an impact on
male’s birth probability suggests the
relevance of socioeconomic and psychological conditions on the SRB, as
has been proposed earlier (Abernethy
and Yip, 1990; Cronk, 1989; Gaulin
and Robbins, 1991).

If the differential parental investment for sex is an adaptive response,
we might expect parents to increase
their reproductive success through this
mechanism (Clutton-Brock and AIlbon, 1982; Clutton-Brock and Iason,
1986; Blaffer-Hrdy, 1988). Higher reproductive success of males born in
higher socioeconomic status families
and of females in lower strata must still
be proven.

This work focuses on the sociodemographic determinants of the sex
ratio at birth. Nevertheless, considerations about the proximate mechanisms that are related to these associations may be very relevant. Coital

frequency is the proximate variable
more clearly related to the sex ratio
at birth, with higher coital frequency
enhancing the probability of a male
(Chahnazarian, 1988). Hormonal levels, such as gonadotrophins, estrogens,
progesterone, and testosterone, for
both parents, may also affect the sex
ratio at birth (James, 1987a, 1987b,
1989). The differences in sex ratio at
birth due to the sociodemographic
variables presented here may be mediated through the proximal action of coital frequency or hormonal changes.
There exists evidence of consensual
unions having a lower coital frequency
than legal unions (Ebanks and Loaiza,
1989). In this study, this finding could
be maintained for single but not for
cohabiting women.

Race is another factor consistently
related to the sex ratio at birth (Chahnazarian, 1988), with a lower SRB for
the Afro-American group. In Venezuelan history, interracial marriages have
been the most common kind of union.
If there is any consequence of racial
differences on sex ratio at birth, it
could hardly be evaluated in this country since ethnic differences exist in very
few sectors of the population.
