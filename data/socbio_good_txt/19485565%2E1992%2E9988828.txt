ABSTRACT: The opportunity for intensity of selection is studied in two backward caste groups
with different occupations, namely Yadava (pastoral) and Vadabalija (fishing) of Bheemunipatnam Taluk of Visakhapatnam District, Andhra Pradesh. The amount of selection intensity
is found to be higher in Vadabalija (0.8583) than Yadava (0.5827). The contribution of mortality
to the total index of selection is greater in Vadabalija (0.6095) than in Yadava (0.3326). When
consanguineity is considered, the fertility components of selection intensity (0.1885) are lower in
the consanguineous group of Yadava than in the nonconsanguineous group (0.2845), whereas in
Vadabalija they are higher in the consanguineous group (0.5261) than in the nonconsanguineous

group (0.2223).

Selection, one of the micro-evolutionary forces is responsible for gene
frequency variation in a population
which in turn could be deciphered
through differential fertility and mortality. This was first devised by Crow
(1958) using census data on birth distribution. Changes in differential fertility and mortality components due to
socioeconomic and cultural factors
have an effect on natural selection
(Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971).
Studies on the Indian tribal and caste
populations (Murty and Ramesh,
1978; Barua, 1976; Rao and Murty,
1984; Rajanikumari et al., 1985; and
others) have supported this observation. The inbreeding also influences
the intensity of natural selection as its
effect is found to be greater on mortality than fertility (Cavalli-Sforza et
al., 1971). The present paper reports
on selection intensities in relation to
inbreeding among two endogamous
caste groups—the Yadava and the Vadabalija.

The Yadava is a pastoral community
while the Vadabalija is a fishing community. Both are socially backward.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Reproductive histories and family
pedigrees were obtained from the Yadava and the Vadabalija of Bheemunipatnam Taluk of Visakhapatnam
District, Andhra Pradesh, India, during 1986-87. Necessary information
was collected from 310 Yadava and 273
Vadabalija women through interviewschedule method. For the estimation of
Selection Intensity (I), only the reproductive histories of 114 Yadava and
135 Vadabalija women, who had completed their fertility are considered.
The method of Crow (1958) is adopted
in the calculation of Index.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

From Table 1, it is evident that the
mortality component (/,,) is higher in

Vol. 39, No. 3-4

Vadabalija (0.6095) than in Yadava
(0.3326), while the fertility component
(J;) is almost equal in both groups.
However, the differences of these components between consanguineous and
nonconsanguineous in each group is
not uniform, though the frequency of
consanguineity (Rajeswari, 1988) is
lower among the Yadava (33.46 per
cent) than the Vadabalija (35.71 per
=cent). It can be noted that (Table 1)
higher selection intensity is associated
with higher mean live births and higher
Smortality component (71.1 per cent)
Aand the corresponding low fertility difcoferential (28.99 per cent) may be due to
‘inadequate sample size and higher prereproductive mortality. In the Yadava,
=the fertility component of selection inratensity (0.1888) is lower in consanguinSeous than in non-consanguineous
"5 (0.2845) which is in contrast to the Va= dabalija.

groups with low inbreeding levels (Rao
and Murty, 1984). The index value (1)
ranges from 0.23 to 3.69 in 64 populations from all over the world (Sphuler,
1973), whereas in Indian caste populations, it ranges from 0.24 to 2.11. A
value greater than 1 is mostly restricted
to tribal and a few caste populations
(Pattusalis and Malas). Studies on rural populations (Mala, Madiga and
Malia) exhibit middle order values and
Vaddes and Malas exhibit the lowest
value.

In the present study, it is observed
that selection is due to mortality component rather than fertility component. Hence, there is more scope for
selection to act through differential
mortality than fertility. The higher
mortality among these populations
may be due not only to their socioeconomic, cultural, and other environmental factors but also to some genetic
factors.
