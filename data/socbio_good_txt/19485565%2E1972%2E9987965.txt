Socioeconomic Status, Migration,

and Morbidity

Georgia, Athens, Georgia

Most studies exploring the relationship
between morbidity and social factors have
been purely demographic in nature; that
is, they have investigated differentials in
morbidity and their relationships to other
demographic vital events, namely migration and mortality in the population. Recently, however, many have come to suspect
that factors in the social structure or social
organization have an important, if not a
crucial, bearing on the occurrence of morbidity. One of the central theses underlying
this view is that inconsistencies among significant aspects of the individual’s position
within the social and cultural structure
result in the development of social stress
which subsequently has an adverse effect
on his physical and mental health. It is
also expected, and often found, that groups
of persons constantly exposed to social
strains that may induce unpleasant, threatening social and psychological stress have
high probabilities of living in poor health
conditions.

Although recent studies have also suggested a possible inverse relationship between social class and differential rates of
morbidity, they have generally neglected
other sociogenic sources of stress which may
exert some influence upon the total course

51

of ill health. For example, most social
epidemiological studies focus upon the prevalence of morbidity in terms of social
status rather than upon a detailed comparative analysis of morbidity by controlling
for migration and residence status. This
lack of differentiation and control may tend
to obscure the relationship between social
class and illness.

To review current knowledge on the
relationship of sociocultural factors to the
occurrence of chronic illness, a few studies
of social stress are cited as of possible
etiological relevance (Jackson, 1962; Jackson and Burke, 1965; Dodge and Martin,
1970; Kasl and Cobb, 1969). Several investigators have utilized macro-sociological

_ variables as alternative indicators of socially

induced stress which has often been considered as having an adverse effect on health
conditions. These major variables are social
class (Meile and Haese, 1969; McBroom,
1970), social mobility (Lystad, 1957;
Kantor, 1965), migration (Malzberg and
Lee, 1956), status integration (Dodge and
Martin, 1970), and population density
(Christian, 1968). However, most studies
have investigated the independent effect of
the main variables rather than the interactive and synergistic effects of the multi

variates on the dependent variable. Thus,
explanations for the relationships between
social factors and illness were always inconclusive. Consequently, most generalizations derived from these studies only posit
an implicit indirect association between
social factors and illness. |

The conceptual framework of the present
study is that various population groups
have different vulnerabilities to disease and
that different levels of social-psychological
stress induced by different social strains
(stressors) lead to differential rates of morbidity. Social strains may be characterized
by three selected macro-sociological variables—status inconsistency, socioeconomic
status (SES), and migration-residence
status. These factors are considered as
sociogenic sources of stress which is defined
by its prolonged and unpleasant stimulating
condition. The variation in total morbidity
rates is expected to be relative to the different risks of the population groups exposed
to these three social-etiological factors (see
Figure 1).

It is postulated that the occurrence of
morbidity varies directly with the multiplicity of social strains a population experiences. The objectives of this investigation
are twofold: first, to demonstrate the

existence of a linkage between the prevalence of morbidity and sociogenic sources
of strain; and second, to detect the interactive effects of social strains on morbidity.
The central concern of this study is to
explore the probable synergistic impact of
social strains on ill health.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The information was obtained from data
collected in household interviews in the
nationwide Survey of Economic Opportunity conducted by the Bureau of the Census
for the Office of Economic Opportunity in
February, 1967. The major purpose of this
survey was to provide a comprehensive
picture of the economic wellbeing of the
population for the calendar year 1966.
Sociodemographic information pertinent to
the primary objective of the survey was
obtained from respondents in stratified random samples representing the total population of the United States.

The study population used in the testing
of the hypotheses is limited to adult male
heads of families and other unrelated males
between the ages of 25 through 64. This
limitation overcomes the irregularities that
would be introduced by using a more
heterogeneous universe. Data on health and

physical conditions were obtained by the
reporting of work-limiting chronic conditions rather than by a health examination
of the population. Therefore, the results as
such may present a conservative (minimum) estimate of prevalent conditions in
the adult male population in the United
States.

In this study, the three sources of social
strains—status inconsistency, socioeconomic
status (SES) and migration-residence status
—were utilized as independent variables;
the work-limiting chronic condition of the
population is the dependent variable. Three
status components—occupation, education,
and income—were ranked in accordance
with a person’s relative position in the total
study population.

Occupation referred to the longest civilian job of an individual in 1966 and was
classified into two basic groups using the
1960 census occupational types with whitecollar workers having the high status and
with blue-collar workers having the low
status. Educational levels were measured
by the highest grade of completed schooling
and by using the median as the cutting
point; those with 11 years or more of education were ranked high and those with less
than 11 years were ranked low. Income
levels were calculated by using the percapita family income which is the quotient
of the 1966 total family income divided by
the number of persons in the family. The
mean per-capita family income of $2,500
was used as the cutting point to determine
high and low income categories. Thus, each
status component was dichotomized into
high (H) and low (L) categories. The
eight possible combinations of the three
status components are: HHH, HHL, HLH,
LHH, HLL, LHL, LLH, and LLL.

The SES level was determined by two
broad categories: those with two or more
high rankings had a high-status level and
those with two or more low rankings had

Socioeconomic Status, Migration, Morbidity

93

a low-status level. When all status components were either in the high or low
categories, there was obviously a consistency of status. The other six combinations,
where the level of one of the components
differed from the levels of other components,
were all inconsistent. Inconsistent patterns
were further categorized by SES level:
HHL, HLH, and LHH were defined as
inconsistent high status; and HLL, LHL,
and LLH were defined as inconsistent low
Status.

Several questions on migration and residence background were asked in the 1967
SEO survey. Migration status was determined by the answer to the question, “‘Has

. ever lived more than 50 miles from
here?” Two observations of residence were
made: one at age 16 and another at the
survey year, 1967. Residence background
refers to rural or urban. Migration status
was cross-classified by residence so that
six generic patterns of migrant-residence
status were developed.!

The existence of morbidity caused by a
particular disease, injury, or impairment
which limited an individual’s ability to work
for more than three months is called a
work-limiting morbidity or simply “morbidity.” Morbidity rates were computed

-from the number of persons with work
limiting chronic conditions per 1,000 of
population at risk and were further adjusted
by age using the total estimate of adult
males in the 1967 United States population
as the standard population. An index of
relative risk is used to indicate the differences in the distributions of morbidity rates
in various population groups at risk. Then,
the synergistic effect of social strains was

variables. The standard error of ageadjusted rates was calculated as follows:

where R was the morbidity rate of a particular population group and J the total
population of a particular group for computing the rate. Critical ratios were used
to examine the significant differences of
age-adjusted rates between two population

values divided by the standard error of this difference. It is a measure of statistical significance. The

only 5% of the total study population were
Negroes, the variability of morbidity patterns they accounted for was very small.
There were marked variations of morbidity
rates by age; therefore, crude morbidity
rates were adjusted for age. Only one major
working hypothesis was formulated for the
analysis of the data. It was assumed that
the SES level itself was important and that
the morbidity rate of the high- and lowstatus levels would differ significantly, irrespective of status inconsistency and
migration status.

Table 2 indicates that the morbidity rate
is about 1.8 times higher among those in

the low than in the high SES group. Controlling for status inconsistency, this difference is more apparent, particularly among
those with consistent statuses. There is, in
fact, a confounding effect of SES level on
status inconsistency, i.e., the consistency
groups are the combination of two status
patterns, HHH and LLL. Hence, the relationship between status inconsistency and
morbidity is obscured. The data confirm
the generalization that persons in the low
SES groups are likely to be found disproportionately in poor health conditions, and
persons in the high SES group are found in
better health conditions. Table 2 also re

veals that SES level apparently exerts more
impact than status inconsistency on illness.

A simple twofold dichotomy of migration
status does not provide a clear picture of
morbidity differentials. Thus, migration
status was cross-classified into six patterns
by two observations (at age 16 and at the
survey year) of rural and urban residences.
The prevalence rate is slightly Jower for
migrants than for nonmigrants. An examination of Table 3 shows that migrants with
a rural background had substantially higher

all migrants. Both urban-to-urban migrants
and urban nonmigrants were far better off
in terms of health conditions. It is worth

noting that rural-to-urban migrants were

also living in poor health even though they
were slightly healthier than rural-to-rural
migrants and rural nonmigrants.

status patterns was made using migrantresidence status as a control factor (Table
4). A substantial difference in the prevalence rate of morbidity was still persistent
between the two SES levels. The results
were again summarized in a matrix table,
indicating different risks in having higher
morbidity rates among the four status
patterns within a particular migrantresidence group. These four status patterns were ranked in ascending order. There
was an inverse relationship between status
level and relative risk of morbidity among
all except urban-to-rural migrants. The
same inverse relationship existed among
rural nonmigrants, but not among urban
ponmigrants, The critical ratio in examin‘ng the significant difference between two
rates for two SES levels shows that the

value is above the 5% level of significance
(Tables 4 and 5).

CONCLUSIONS

The results of this analysis support the
general postulate that morbidity differentials are greater in the low than in the
high SES levels. The expected differences
for migrants and nonmigrants were not
very striking. Somewhat as expected, SES
levels played a significant role in determining morbidity differentials, irrespective of
status inconsistency and migration status.
Considerable differences according to SES
levels still existed after the age effect was
partialed out. However, such status differences in morbidity distributions did not
generally exist among urban-to-rural migrants; high SES migrants had higher

morbidity rates than those of low SES
levels in the inconsistent status group.
This finding indicates that there are interactive effects between status patterns and
urban-to-rural migrants on morbidity.
The results of this study seem to imply
that differential exposure to social etiological factors, mainly sociogenic sources of
stress, may account for significant proportions of the differences in the health conditions of the populations. An individual
exposed to more than one possible etiological factor in his life experience has a relatively greater morbidity risk than the sum

of the risks of individuals each exposed to
one factor alone. The foregoing discussion
pointing to the complexity of the relations
between social factors and illness is not
intended to derive a highly powerful predictability of ill health by social factors;
rather, it is to explicate the possible social
etiological linkage between social structure
and illness.

In conclusion, a crucial question needs
to be answered: Do the synergistic effects
of social factors on work-limiting morbidity
reflect (1) the differences in utilization of
medical care and services or (2) the cumu

lative and chronic impact of sociopathogenic
factors on ill health? The answers to this
question should prove helpful in the planning of social and welfare policies to promote health programs, since preventive
programs for chronic illnesses may then
focus upon uncovering and minimizing
social etiological factors associated with
disease.
In summary, this study has attempted to
contribute to the further understanding of
in the social epidemiology of morbidity and
Q the sociogenic factors leading to it. Perhaps
Oit will stimulate more research in utilizing
& demographic data in the identification of
8 the social risk factors in the course of ill© ness. Using this approach, preventive pro< grams might be developed which would
ci lead to the control and reduction of
