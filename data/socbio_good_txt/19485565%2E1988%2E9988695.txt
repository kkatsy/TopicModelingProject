BSTRACT: Cumulative fertility is analyzed for four regions of Mexico, based on World Fertility

urvey data of 1976-77: the State of Baja California, the Northwest region, the State of Jalisco,
wand the Northeast region. Based on stepwise regression methodology, the study compares
esults for twelve subsamples of married respondents, three age categories by four regions. The
oAlependent variables are children ever born and children ever born in the last five years.
Migration, urban, educational, and occupational variables are included as independent
~wariables. Regression results reveal level of education is the major, and negative, influence on
fertility. Other results include specific negative effects for prior occupation, size of place of
+fesidence, and childhood place of residence. Fertility effects appear different for migration
rigin and destination regions, but more similar for younger ages. Effects of migration on

rtility are small.

2 Since about 1940 Mexico’s populaAtion growth has been rapid. Its populaStion in 1984 was estimated at 81.7 mil‘dion versus a 1980 population of 69.9
Snillion. One set of current projections
Andicates a year 2000 population of 112.8
“million, assuming a decrease in fertility
“rates over the projection period (PopuYation Reference Bureau, 1986).
& Previous rapid growth in Mexico has
Sbeen accompanied by major problems,
such as a large volume of international
migration to the United States, rapid urbanization, and several strong patterns
of internal migration within Mexico, especially to Mexico City and the MexicoU.S. border regions. The current Mexican government has recognized possible
deleterious implications of these trends
for Mexico’s wellbeing. It has strongly
encouraged fertility contro] and
adopted an official policy of population
decentralization, which encourages residents of Mexico’s large cities, especially

Mexico City, to migrate to mediumsized cities.
This study has the following goals:

1. to study the effects of selected socioeconomic variables on fertility in four
regions of Mexico; |

2. to study differences in effects on fertility between Baja and its two important
sending regions; ~

3. to appraise the relative influence of migration on fertility for the regions;

4, to interpret the underlying causation if
important effects are found;

5. to relate the research results for the
borderlands samples to research findings of a larger ongoing research project on the Mexican borderlands.

To understand better Mexico’s present and prospective population growth/
distribution problems, it is important to
understand in depth its past problems.
The present study is part of a larger project funded by U.C. Mexus and the
UCR-Mexico Collaborative Research
and Training Group to study historical

population growth, distribution, and
change throughout Mexico.

Other segments of this project include municipio-level studies of the
Mexican borderlands region (Pick et al.,
1986, 1987, 1988c) a study of migration
flows to Baja California (Butler et al.,
1986), studies of Mexican interstate migration patterns (Fukurai et al., 1987,
1988), and a description of numerous socloeconomic variables in Mexico (Pick
et al., 1988a).

PREVIOUS RESEARCH

This section looks at general trends in
Mexican fertility, including results from
the World Fertility Survey, briefly discusses related trends in U.S.—Hispanic
fertility, and examines several reports
and studies of regional fertility in Mexico.

Since 1970, fertility has dropped
significantly in Mexico. The Mexican
Total Fertility Rate (TFR) dropped
from 5.9 in 1976-77 to 4.4 in 1986. By
comparison, the U.S. TFR was 1.8 in
1986. The Mexican crude birth rate
dropped from 44.2 per 1,000 in 1970 to
32 in 1986. The U.S. crude birth rate
was 16in 1986. The drop in Mexican fertility stems from a number of factors, including increasing availability and prevalence of contraception, increasing
literacy and education, increasing female employment, and more emphasis
on family planning by the Mexican government (Wulf, 1982; International
Family Planning Perspectives, 1982).

In recent years, there have been especially significant gains in contraception and education. For example, based
on results of the 1981 Mexican Rural
Family Planning Survey, Wulf reported
that from 1977 to 1981 the percentage of
Mexican woman of reproductive age

 

Social Biology

who practiced contraception increased
from 31 to 41 per cent while in the same
period the Mexican TFR dropped by 15
per cent.

Education has proved important in
previous studies as a negative influence
on Mexican fertility. In recent decades,
Mexican educational progress has been
major. Education, as measured by per
cent of population 6-14 years old matriculated in primary school increased
from 45.3 per cent tn 1940 to 59.2 per
cent in 1970 and to 64.8 in 1980 (Zambrano, 1979; Secretaria de Programacion y Presupuesto, 1984). Although
great strides have been made, education
in Mexican rural areas remains backward. For example, in 1970, the per cent
of schools offering a full six years of primary education was 89.9 per cent for urban schools, versus 19.6 per cent for rural schools. However, in the 1980’s the
latter percentage remains low and will
continue to dampen Mexican educational prospects.

One of the major national surveys of
Mexican fertility was the Mexican
World Fertility Survey or WFS (also
known as the Encuesta Mexicana de Fecundidad), conducted in Mexico between July 1976 and March 1977. Regional subsamples from this survey
provide the data for the present research
project. The following discussion gives
some background on the survey and
some of its major findings (Secretaria de
Programacion y Presupuesto, 1978,
1979a, b; c; World Fertility Survey,
1980).

The Mexican Survey was a nationally
representative, stratified, clustered area
sample based on 2 or 3 stages and utilizing three questionnaires—community,
household, and individual. The latter
contained the WES core questionnaire
as well as additional questions specific to

 
Vol. 35, No. 1-2

Mexico and was successfully administered to 7,310 interviewees.

Among the most important WFS
findings for Mexico were the following:

1. Mexican fertility decreased in the early
1970’s (Gross Reproduction Rate decreased from 3.46 in 1967-69 to 3.00 in
1973-75), but still remained relatively
high (Total Fertility Rate was 6.15 in
1973-75).

2. Educational level and fertility had a
significant negative relationship. For
instance, age-standardized cumulative
fertility equalled 5.1 for respondents
with no schooling, 3.4 for primary
school graduates, and 2.1 for secondary school graduates.

3. Desire not to have additional children
increased rapidly with the number of
children and was correlated with educational level, size of place of residence, and economic development of
the region.

4. Median age at marriage increased with
more recent cohorts, greater education, and urban residence.

Although the present research focuses on Mexican fertility, it is impor2 tant to mention briefly studies of
> Mexican-American fertility, both be> cause of their methodological relevance
3 and because Mexican fertility, espe"S cially in the Mexican borderlands, indi< rectly affects U.S. ~Hispanic fertility. In
= perhaps the most comprehensive study
A to date of U.S.—Hispanic fertility, Jaffe
et al., (1980) used 1970 U.S. census data
to analyze five ethnic subgroups of the
Hispanic population. The study’s major
findings included generally higher Hispanic (versus Anglo) birth rates and a
very strong negative influence of education on fertility. An important indirect
research conclusion is that relatively
high Mexican fertility levels will contribute to raising U.S. fertility levels due to
the continuing substantial net migration
of Mexicans into the United States.

Mexican Fertility 139

Other studies of Hispanics have included examination of effects of generation and length of U.S. residence on
Hispanic fertility (Bean and Swicegood,
1980-81; Bean et al., 1983).

Another relevant research area concerns fertility levels and causative factors in Mexican regions (Garcia y
Garma, 1979; Hernandez et al., 1982;
Hicks, 1974; Holian, 1970 and 1983;
Pick et al., 1986, 1988c; Pillet, 1980;
Poblab Staff, 1980; Seiver, 1975; Zambrano, 1979). Of these studies, four are
pertinent to the present research.

Seiver (1975) studied Mexican fertility by weighted log linear regression
techniques with samples from the 1960
and 1970 Mexican censuses of the 32
federal entities (i.e., 31 states plus the
Federal District). He selected the adjusted child-woman ratio as a dependent
variable. For independent variables,
Seiver used measures of income, education, urbanization, occupational status,
industrial composition, labor-force participation, and sex-ratio. The variables
which accounted for the largest proportion of variance in fertility were income
and sex ratio, which had positive influences in both 1960 and 1970. Other
important independent variables were
percentage economically active in white
collar occupations (negative effect) and
education (negative effect). This study
gives a valuable set of benchmark results
for 1960 and 1970 census data and is also
methodologically sophisticated.

A second study is that of Garcia y
Garma (1979). She sought to study fertility differences between regions and
between rural and urban areas. She analyzed fertility for the federal entities and
investigated the relationship of fertility
with socioeconomic variables. Data
were obtained from the Mexican censuses of 1960 and 1970 and from Mexi

140 Pick et al.

can vital statistics of 1969, 1970, and
1971. She concluded that these latter
data were acceptable, although some
analysts regarded them as inaccurate
(e.g. Bruch et al., 1980). A General
Marital Fertility Index, which consists of
a weighted average of median number
of children per married women over all
fertile age groups, was used. A general
Fertility Index was estimated by multiplying the Marital Fertility Index by an
Index of Proportion of Women Married, which assumes negligible fertility
of single women.

The General Fertility Index was used
as the dependent variable and a group of
“Intermediate Variables” as independent variables. These latter were surrogates for the well-known intermediate
fertility variables of Davis and Blake.
The regression analysis indicated that
the most significant influences on the Index were per cent of women widowed,
separated, divorced, and median age of
sexual union.

Garcia y Garma then proceeded to
construct a two-dimensional graph
which, for each federal entity, presented
the following information: (1) combined
effects from the significant intermediate
variables; (2) effects of socioeconomic
factors, level of modernization in 1960,
and standard of living in 1970; (3) General Fertility Index; (4) Marital Fertility
Index; and (5) Index of Proportion Married. The two-dimensional analysis
showed a wealth of information, too
lengthy to detail here. It is clear from the

graph that there is large regional varia
tion in Mexican fertility and some of its
correlates. This variation led Garcia y
Garma to divide the Mexican states into
four groups on the basis of fertility.
Based on a sample from Mexico City,
Zambrano (1979) studied the relationship between fertility and levels of edu
Social Biology

cation, using data from a special 1970
survey On migration into Mexico City.
The analysis indicated the education at
all levels, from primary to university,
had the effect of reducing fertility. This
is true even when factors such as social
class and occupation are taken into account. Zambrano selected as a fertility
measure the median number of children
born living, by three age groups of
mother, 15-24, 25-34, and 35+. The
effect of education was nearly always
sharply negative. He divided occupation
groups into employers, salaried employees, and manual laborers. There were
inconsistent occupational effects on fertility with salaried employees generally
having lower fertility.

Pick et al. (1986, 1988c) studied socioeconomic effects on fertility in the
Mexican borderlands. These studies are
unique in utilizing the municipio as a
sampling unit. Subsamples included urban, rural, state, and border sampling
units. Stepwise regression was used,
with children ever born to women 20-29
and child-woman ratio as dependent
variables, and literacy, labor-force participation (male and female), unemployment, underemployment, income,
urbanization, and immigration as independent variables. Results indicate that
literacy has the most important and negative effect on fertility. In the overall
sample, the pair of labor-force participation variables exert important and opposite effects, female negative and male
positive. Other secondary effects are
noted for employment (negative), low
income (mixed), urbanization (positive), female underemployment (negative), and immigration (positive).

Survey (WFS). The present study utilizes four regional subsamples consisting
of data on all respondents for the State
of Baja California, the remainder of the
Northwest region (consisting of the
states of Baja California Sur, Sinoloa,
Sonora, and Nayarit), the State of Jalisco, and the Northeast region (consisting of the states of Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas). Hereafter, the remainder of
the Northwest region is referred to as
the Northwest.

A previous study of migration to
Baja California concluded that there
was a steady immigration stream from
1900 to 1980 from a consistent group of
states along the western Pacific coast
(Butler et al., 1986). For example in
1980, in terms of the percentage of total
lifetime migrants to Baja California
from an origin state, the major sending
states were Jalisco (19.9 per cent of immigrants), Sonora (12.0 per cent), and
Sinoloa (11.8 per cent). In 1970, these
respective percentages were 22.8, 11.8,
and 10.7. Although specific data for
Baja California are not available, Vasquez’s study (1984) for the Mexican borderlands region would indicate this internal stream is also an important one
for staging of international migrants to
the United States. Furthermore, studies
of migration streams for Mexican undocumented international migrants to
California reveal the same major states
of origin (especially Jalisco and Sinoloa)
as for the internal migration stream to
Baja California. (Jones, 1984; Cantu,
1986).

It is the intent of the present study to
compare levels of fertility and socioeconomic influences on fertility for two major origin regions (i.e., Jalisco and the
Northwest region) and the destination
region (1.e., Baja California) of this major internal migration stream.

Mexican Fertility

141

  

The Northeast region is also included
for comparison, since it is the principal
destination region of a major internal
migration stream in eastern Mexico, and
it is also likely an important region for
the staging of migrants to the United
States (Vasquez, 1984; Jones, 1984).
Results for Baja California and the
Northeast will be compared to determine if there are similarities and/or differences in fertility.

For each region, the WFS subsamples are further subdivided by age and
marital status as follows: married, 1524; married, 25-34; married, 35-49;
and single, 15-24. The subsampling is
necessary to control for age and marital
status. The subsamples, single women
25-34 and single women 35-49, are excluded because their sizes are too small
(less than 12) to allow for multivariate
statistical analysis. Also, because most
questions utilized in the study concern
marital events, the subsample of single
women 15-24 contains data for relatively few variables.

Subsample sizes are shown in Table
1. They vary in size from 15 (Baja California, single, 15-24) to 169 (Northeast,
married, 35-49). The total population
of the four regions constitutes 21.0 per
cent of the Mexican 1980 population.

The following dependent variables
were selected for the regression analysis: (1) children even born (CHILDEVBORN), and (2) children born in the
past five years (CHILDEVBORN
(—5 yrs)). These variables were selected because they are the best available indicators of fertility among the
WFS survey variables, and they cover
different portions of the life span: (1) refers to cumulative lifetime events while
(2) refers to events in the last five years.

Of the selected independent variabies, nine are dummy variables. DefiniDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

because of the large number of missing

Stepwise regression analysis was performed on the dependent variables. The
minimum criteria for entering variables
was an F'level of 1. The number of steps
selected varied from 1 to 4 by subsample
and was determined based on the relative significance levels for steps as well
as the importance perceived by the investigators of variables for a particular
subsample.

RESULTS

Cumulative fertility shows little variation by region (Table 5). The only regional variation of note is somewhat
lower fertility in the Northeast. On the
other hand, by age category, there is the
anticipated large increase in completed
fertility, approaching a mean level of
about 7 children per woman for the age
category 35-49.

Children born in the last five years is
shown in Table 6. There are consistently
high values for age categories 15-24 and
25-34, dropping by about 50 per cent for

Ssame measures of fertility based on the
‘5 Mexican census of 1980. After taking
pate account an overall 15 per cent drop
— in fertility, these data generally corres3 8 pond to the WFS. However, it should be
g noted that while fertility dropped signi5 ficantly compared to that of 1976-77 for
4 the two older age groups, it remained
virtually the same for age group 15-24.
Also, the fertility rates for the Northwest and Jalisco are significantly higher
than for Baja and the Northeast. This
difference reflects the generally low regional level of fertility in the Mexican
borderlands states compared to the medium level of fertility for the “sending
regions”’ of the Northwest and Jalisco. It
is likely the Northwest’s relatively lower
values in the WFS data is a sampling artifact. Hence, we conclude that for the

of Mi

migration stream to Baja California, origin regions are significantly higher in
cumulative fertility than the destination
region. The fertility drop may be the
result of better educational and economic conditions at destination; or, as
results from a study in Korea suggest
(Repetto, 1979), it may result from an
accumulation of migrants, as migrants
overall have lower fertility than nonmigrants which persists even at the destination due to problems finding permanent
housing and the lack of extended family
members for child care. Present regression results will be discussed later relative to this drop. Also, on the basis of
raw data, the two “‘destination regions,”’
the Northeast and Baja California, show
comparable results.

Mean values for the independent variables are presented in Table 3. If we examine the inverse variable MIGSTAT,
1.e., per cent not migrant, regional differences are apparent (see Table 8).
Baja California has significantly more
migration occurring than the other regions. This is seen especially for the two
older age categories with 95~98 per cent

of the population being migrants. These
high. values reflect Baja California’s
rapid growth, and related high inmigration rates for the period, 1930-70. By
age, Baja California, Jalisco, and the
Northeast reveal significant decreases
by age in per cent nonmigrant, whereas
for the Northwest there is no perceptible
change by age in per cent nonmigrant.
Lack of change is particularly due to the
oldest age group, which is considerably
less migratory for the Northwest than
the overall mean for age group 35-49, a
finding which is unexplained.

For the migration variable NUMPLACES there is considerable age and
regional variation (see Table 9). Baja
California consistently has the highest
migration rates. The reason may be
Baja California’s proximity to the United States, which encourages immigration from other Mexican states in order
to participate in the twin-city border
economies and/or to migrate to the
United States. For a region, one would
expect the cumulative number of moves
to increase with age. This is indeed the
case for Baja California, for which there
is about a one-half move average in
crease for each age category. However,
for the other three regions, a significant
age increase does not occur between age
category 25~34 and 35-49. Our interpretation is that expected age increases
are offset by cohort-related decreases.

Sizeplace (i.e., a measure of size of
place of residence at the time of the survey, as defined in Table 2) shows that
the urbanization of the respective regions is Clearly inversely related to recent fertility, a finding for Mexico corroborated by others (Garcia y Garma,
1980; Pillet, 1980).

CHILDPLACE and PCHILDPLACE! show consistent differences
among regions. For most subsamples,
Baja California has the highest percentage of town/city origin. This finding correlates with a previous study (Butler et
al., 1986) which revealed that from 1950
to 1980 the bulk of Baja California’s immigrants originated in Jalisco, which is
highly urbanized. In 1980, by census
figures, Jalisco was 76 per cent urban

respondent’s partner.

ized, fifth among the federal entities. Its
high urbanization is also reflected in Jalisco’s high values for SIZEPLACE.
Another consistent regional difference
is relatively lower percentages of town/
city origin for the Northwest and Northeast. While this finding may be explained for the Northwest as due to its
more rural nature, for the urban Northeast, it is likely due to significant histori“cal rural-to-urban migration streams
(Browning and Feindt, 1969, discuss
such migration for 1960 and earlier).

Literacy, measured by LITERACY
and PLITERACY, for most samples is
highest for Baja California. Also, it decreases significantly between age categories, reflecting less educational attainment for older cohorts. It is nearly 100
per cent for subsamples of single
women. This finding corroborates other
studies which indicate greater education
for single versus married respondents of
similar age.

147

Occupational differences among the
subsamples are reflected in values for
PRIOROCCUP, i.e., occupation prior
to marriage, and LASTOCCUP, ie.,
last occupation since marriage. For the
purposes of regression analysis these
variables were coded as dummies (0 if
the respondent did not work; 1 if the respondent worked). As seen in Table 3,
51-66 per cent of respondents worked
prior to marriage, whereas only 11-38
per cent worked after marriage. Thus, it
may be inferred that the transition from
single to married status resulted in about
30-40 per cent of respondents stopping
work.

When analyzed in more detail, the
results for variables PRIOROCCUP
and LASTOCCUP reveal rather sharp
differences between regions for certain
occupations. For example, for age 25~
34, the percentage of currently employed respondents in the Professional/
Managerial category for Baja California, the Northwest, Jalisco, and the
Northeast were 2.3, 4.7, 5.8, and 5.6 per
cent respectively. For Clerical Workers,
these per cents were 9.1, 5.5, 12.5, and
18.3. No attempt is made in this paper to
analyze these distinctions further, except to note that they differ significantly
enough to warrant further investigation.

In contrast to a preponderance of respondents not currently working, virtually none of the respondents partners
was not currently working. The results
for partners seem remarkably low given
Mexico’s unemployment problems.
However, Mexican census results also
reveal a very low level of male unemployment. For instance, for the nation,
the per cent unemployed for males, as
measured by the category ‘“‘desocupados” divided by the economically active
population, was a mere 0.55 per cent,
while a startling 26.9 per cent did not
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

specify a response (Secretaria de Programacion y Presupuesto, 1984, Table
9). It is important to note that many of
the present sample respondents’ partners assigned to an occupation and
counted as employed, may actually be
underemployed.

RESULTS OF THE REGRESSION ANALYSIS

The key objectives of the regression
analysis were to answer the questions:

1. What are the significant fertility influences in the regions by age and sex
categories for lifetime fertility and fertility for the last five years?

2. What are the important common fertility determinants for the four regions?

3. Are there significant differences in influences on fertility between Baja California and the two important migration sending regions to Baja
California?

4, Do fertility influences in Baja California resemble those in another “‘destination” region, the Northwest?

5. Are there significant influences of migration on fertility?

SOCIOECONOMIC INFLUENCES ON
LIFETIME FERTILITY BY AGE AND REGION

Analysis results are consistent between regions for lifetime fertility. For
all the lifetime fertility regressions, variables which are significant are few and
consistent in direction. For instance, 73
per cent of the significant variables are
either LEVED or PRIOROCCUP. The
direction of effect of these variables is
consistently negative. The most significant results for the different age categories follow.

Ages 15-24.—For Baja California,
the Northwest and Jalisco, LEVED has
the most significant and negative effect.
This finding agrees with many previous
studies in Mexico and elsewhere which

 

Social Biology

show that more educated women tend
to have lower fertility.

Occupation also influences fertility.
For the Northwest, working since marriage significantly increases fertility. A
possible explanation is that the wife’s
working increases family income allowing for support of more children. However, working opposite to this explanation is reduced time available for
childbearing. Because this effect occurs
significantly only one other time in the
fertility regressions, it is likely an effect
for a particular cohort in a particular region. Another significant occupational
effect, for the Northeast, is a negative
one from working prior to union. This
effect, which occurs several other places
in the regressions and in prior research,
may be explained by an accompanying
increase in age at marriage. Although
the women in the subsample were currently married, they may have been
married for only a short time and thus
had less childbearing time. Also, for the
Northeast, the positive effect of partner’s literacy is in opposition to the
standard explanation.

Ages 25-34.—For Baja California,
there is a significant negative effect for
PCHILDPLACE. This effect, and/or a
related negative effect for CHILDPLACE, occurs significantly in two
other regressions. These effects imply
that urban childhood origin for either
marital partner (or both) reduces later
childbearing, results which agree with
those of Lee et al. (1983). Generally, rural fertility is significantly higher than urban fertility in Mexico (Wulf, 1982).
The present results show that rural (or
urban) childhood residence leads to specific patterns of later childbearing. Perhaps early rural or urban cultural/environmental influences shape later childbearing attitudes and behaviors.

The significant negative influence of
LEVED for all regions except Baja is
consistent with overall results.

For Jalisco, there is a significant negative effect from PRIOROCCUP and
for Bajaa significant positive effect from
NUMPLACES.

Ages 35-49.—The results are somewhat weaker, less consistent, and less
readily interpreted for this age category
than for the younger age categories. The
weakening may be due in part to the
longer time period during which childbearing occurs. Asa result, childbearing
of respondents varies to a greater extent
in the appropriateness of timing relative
to the independent variables. The most
significant influence is again the negative one of LEVED.

LEVED is not present in the regression for Baja California, which was true
for the previous age categories. The
weakening of educational effect in Baja
over age 25 may be due to the extra importance of the high rate and volume of
inmigration between 1930 and 1970 to
Baja California. For these age categories, variables related to migration
and urbanization (NUMPLACES,
PCHILDPLACE, and SIZEPLACE)
displace education from its normal dominant position as a fertility influence.

For the other three regions, in addition to education, occupation (LASTOCCUP for the Northwest and
PRIOROCCUP for the Northeast) exerts significant negative effects.

SOCIOECONOMIC INFLUENCES ON
FERTILITY FOR LAST FIVE YEARS BY AGE
AND REGION

Again, the regression results are gen
erally consistent among regions and age
categories. For all the regressions for
fertility for last five years, three varia
Social Biology

bles account for 69 per cent of the significant results and are consistent in direction. These variables are LEVED,
SIZEPLACE, and CHILDPLACE,
and are consistently negative.

Ages 15—24.—-Education, the dominant variable, exerts a consistently negative effect. The other nonmigratory
variable, LITERACY, has a surprising
positive effect for the Northeast. This
effect is contrary to a general conclusion
of the research concerning education’s
dampening effect on fertility. LITERACY is assumed to have an effect similar to LEVED. Therefore, this result is
regarded as spurious.

Ages 25~34.—For Baja and the
Northwest, LEVED is again dominant
and negative. For Jalisco, SIZEPLACE
is the most important, and negative, effect. This variable is also present for the
oldest ages. Since it was not present for
Jalisco for the CHILDEVBORN dependent variable, its influence is hypothesized to be due to an effect, particular to Jalisco, in which recent fertility
(i.e., last 5 years) for older age categories is decreased for residents of larger
urban areas. Such an effect may be due
to social conventions prevalent in Jalisco. This effect could only be confirmed by further special surveys in a
size range of urban areas tn Jalisco. For
the Northeast, the most significant effect is a negative one for CHILDPLACE. A possible explanation is that
an urban childhood leads to lowered fertility expectations. There is also a significant negative effect from partner’s literacy. One interpretation of this effect
might be that partner’s literacy is acting
as a substitute for respondent’s education. However, the correlation of PLITERACY and LEVED is —0.152. Instead, a better interpretation is that

lower literacy in the partner leads to a
less informed couple and hence lower
fertility.

Ages 35-49.—For the oldest ages,
the two most important general results
are the disappearance of LEVED as a
significant dependent variable and the
lack of consistency of results among regions indicating regional differences. In
contrast to children ever born, this lessening of consistency of results between
regions may not be ascribed to a longer
period of childbearing, but must reflect
greater importance of region at older
ages. LEVED doesn’t appear in any regression. By contrast, for dependent
variable CHILDEVBORN, ages 35- 49, LEVED was significant in two out of
four regressions. In other words, differ

ences in educational levels affect cumuJative cohort fertility, but not cohort fertility for the last 5 years. An
interpretation is that fertility, ages 35—
49, which averages 0.80 for the four regions, is often unplanned and sporadic
(fertility is lower for this age category.)
Hence, this older fertility is less dependent on careful planning, a function of
educational level, and more on chance
events.

The results for Baja California are remarkably similar for CHILDEVBORN
(—5 yrs.) and CHILDEVBORN. The
most significant variable, SIZEPLACE,
has a negative influence. In Baja California, this result means that older age
fertility is reduced in the large cities of
Tijuana and Mexicali, relative to the

smaller cities and towns. This reduction
may reflect better social and economic
conditions and/or improved contraception for the average household in these
two large border cities.

For the Northwest, LASTOCCUP
exerts the most important (but nonsignificant) negative influence. This finding is
explained by the oft-repeated reason
that working status detracts from time
and energy for childbearing.

For Jalisco, SIZEPLACE has a significant negative inftuence. This effect is
interpreted similarly to that for the age
category 25-34. The comparison between CHILDEVBORN (—5 yrs.) and
CHILDEVBORN made for those ages
also holds true here, mainly that recent
fertility for the older ages is decreased
for residents of larger urban areas.

Finally, for the Northeast, the important variables differ completely from
results for CHILDEVBORN, ages 3549, They resemble CHILDEVBORN
(—5 yrs.), age 25-34, due to the most
significant negative influence of
CHILDPLACE. A possible explanation is that urban childhood may condition women to lower fertility expectations.

DISCUSSION

The major result from the analysis
presented in this paper is a significant
negative effect of respondent’s educational level on fertility. Although far
from universal, this result is present
across a variety of age groups, regions,
and for both dependent variables. Out
of twenty-four regressions, it is significant in fourteen instances. Although
many explanations are possible, two are
particularly relevant here: (1) Education leads to greater access to and understanding of contraception; and (2) edu
Mexican Fertility

1§3

cation leads to a greater tendency
toward work activities. In the latter explanation, greater education increases
the desire and opportunities for a
woman to work, reducing emphasis on
and time available for childbearing.
Also, education and work both lead to
delayed marriage, which decreases fertility in terms of years available for
childbearing.

There is much support in the Mexican fertility literature for education’s
importance. At the individual level, Holian (1970, 1983) and Zambrano (1979)
noted the great importance of education. However, these studies had few
control variables or competing independent variables. Holian found a highly
significant negative educational gradient even after controlling for urban
level. The gradient was present for married respondents, but weakened for consensually married respondents. This
weakening cannot be investigated in the
present study because of small sample
sizes for consensually married respondents.

At the municipio level, Pick et al.
(1987, 1988c, ms.) found a significant
negative effect for a variable related to
education, namely literacy. Because of
the high correlation of education and literacy, only literacy was included, for
collinearity reasons. Literacy is discussed here as a proxy variable for education. Study results revealed literacy as
dominant and negative, and this is true
across major rural, urban, and border
subsamples. However, this correspondence must be qualified by noting the
difference in units of analysis, i.e.,
municipio level versus individual level in
the present research.

Seiver’s (1975) state results for 1960
and 1970 show significant negative effects for education, although it has

fallen back to second or third place in
importance. Again, the unit of analysis
is different from that in the present research. Other state studies mentioned
earlier (Hicks, 1974; Garcia y Garma,
1979) did not include education or literacy as independent variables.

It is important to note that the
present education effects weaken for the
oldest age group. For children ever
born, this finding may reflect a cohort effect. The childbearing of older cohorts
occurred largely in the late 60’s and 70’s
when the contraceptive knowledge argument was less relevant because of less
prevalent contraception and the female
occupational argument was less relevant
because of lower female occupational
participation. For children born in the
last five years, the same arguments
largely hold true because respondent’s
educational level is presumed to be
rather stable from younger to older
childbearing ages.

Major secondary effects on fertility
were noted in selected subsamples for
prior occupation, size of place, and
childhood place of residence. Prior occupation is of greatest importance, visa-vis the other independent variables,
for the Northeast region and the youngest and oldest age groups. This finding is
similar to those in Korea (Repetto,
1979) and corresponds with related findings of increased age at marriage due to
work in Korea (Repetto, 1979) and in
Mexico (Garcia y Garma, 1979; World
Fertility Survey, 1980). The specific effect for the Northeast is unexplained. A

prior Mexican study showed a similar ef
fect for Mexican borderlands municipios (Pick et al., 1988c, ms.), in which
female labor force participation, ages 15
to 29, was significant and negative for
the overall, high urbanization, rural,
and nonborder adjacent subsamples.

 

Pick et al.

However, eastern and western subsamples did not differ in the effect, so a selective effect corresponding to the
present Northeast subsample was not
corroborated. In the other prior studies
considered, only Seiver (1975) included
a similar variable, again female labor
force participation, and no significant
effects were noted.

Size of place also reveals a selective
effect, significant and negative for the
younger and middle age categories in Jalisco, as well as for the oldest age category in Baja California. This negative
urban effect has much support in the international fertility literature for a variety of units of analysis and study methodologies. In studies of Mexico, the most
relevant result at the individual level is a
strong negative urban effect noted by
Holian (1983), controlling for marital
status and education. In Seiver’s (1975)
state-level study, urbanization domi
~ nated in importance for 1960 and 1970.

Similarly, municipio-level results reveal
a dominant and negative urbanization
effect only for the U.S. border adjacent
subsample.

In the present research, the negative
effect of childhood place of residence is
significant only for the Northeast region, and without clear explanation. We
speculate that the negative direction
results from a strong association between childhood and present places of
residence. If it is assumed that social
patterns of childhood place of origin are
maintained, even after migration, the
argument may have merit. However,
this argument is weakened by the fact of
heavy rural-to-rural migration in Mexico In the 60’s and 70’s.

A question addressed by the present
study is the degree of similarity or difference in fertility effects between sending
regions and destination for the major

historical migration stream to Baja Cali
fornia. Study results reveal) that effects

are very similar between the Jalisco and

Northeast sending regions and Baja for

the youngest age category but dissimilar

for the older age groups, although less
so for children ever born in the last five
years. It is important to mention that
many studies indicate that the young
adult population is highly migratory.

i, Hence, effects are likely to remain the
S same for most migrants after arrival, at
= ~~ least while still in the young age group.
‘© For older females, effects on fertility are
® different, so it would be of interest to
A know for migrants, if effects after arrival
% resemble more effects of origin or destiG! nation. Unfortunately, the present data
2 do not allow such an analysis.

In a limited way, the effect of migration on fertility can be assessed by looking at the relative importance on fertility
of migration status and number of places
= ever lived. Overall, the effects are mi° nor, with three significant exceptions,
= two negative effects of migration status
and one positive effect of number of
places. The former correspond with pre— viously mentioned findings in Korea
© (Repetto, 1979). The apparent contradiction of the latter is unexplained. Such
hypothetical causal pathways as migration’s disruption of childbearing or high
fertility resulting in more stopping
places should be looked into.

In the group of prior Mexican studies
reviewed earlier, only Pick et al. (1986,
1987) included an independent variable
concerning migration. In that study
the only significant migration effect is a
negative one on child-woman ratio in
U.S.-border—adjacent municipios. In
the present study, the Baja California
subsample is closest to a “U.S.-border—
adjacent”’ one, since a large percentage
of Baja California’s population is con

tained in the border-adjacent municlipios of Mexicali and Tijuana. Curiously,
the only significant migration effect for
Baja California is a positive one, Opposite to that in the prior study.
However, comparability of the results
suffers from different fertility measures,
geographic units of analysis, and time
points.

CONCLUSION

The major findings of the present
study are as follows:

1. Mean fertility as measured by children ever born was 4.34 for the 1976-77
WES samples versus 3.69 for the Mexican census of 1980. Fertility varied
somewhat by region, with the highest
and lowest values in Jalisco and the
Northeast, respectively. Expected agerelated changes in fertility were noted.

2. Regression analysis revealed respondent’s level of education was the
major, and negative, effect on fertility,
across a variety of ages and regions, although the effect weakened in the older
age groups. This result has substantial
corroboration in the literature.

3. Significant and specific effects, all
negative, are present for prior occupation, size of place of residence, and
childhood place of residence.

4. Fertility effects were compared for
origin versus destination of the major
historical migration stream to Baja.
Overall, there are major differences in
fertility levels and effects on fertility be- _
tween the origin regions of Jalisco and.
the Northwest and the destination region of Baja California. However, the
effects were similar for the youngest age
category.

5. Effects of migration on fertility are
minor and call for further analysis.
