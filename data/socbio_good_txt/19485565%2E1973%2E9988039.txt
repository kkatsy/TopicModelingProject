Premarital Pregnancy: A Record

Linkage Analysis

Alan M. Sear

Department of Applied Health Sciences

New Orleans, Louisiana

The primary concern of this paper is the
prediction and analysis of premarital pregnancy, one of the components of population
growth. It is becoming increasingly clear
that fertility rates are most easily changed
by meeting the established needs of a population, rather than by creating needs where
none previously existed or trying to change
attitudes that exist but are opposed to the
changes desired. To the extent that premarital pregnancies in the United States
are unwanted pregnancies (or at least not
strongly desired), their identification is, in
effect, the definition of a target group whose
fertility rates should be easily lowered, resulting in a lower rate for the total population.

The data on premarital pregnancy used
here come from the linkage of marriage and
birth records rather than from interviews
and thereby avoid many of the problems of
response bias. There is no opportunity for
the persons involved to refuse to respond or
to falsify their responses, an important asset
in studying a topic as sensitive as premarital
pregnancy. On the other hand, the analysis
is restricted to the data present on the marriage and birth records, including their
accuracy and completeness. Obviously there

 

is no opportunity to probe into a response
or ask additional questions on the basis of
a previous response. Despite this liability,
the method of record linkage is probably
one of the most useful tools available to
social science in the study of sensitive
topics such as fertility and sexual behavior.
Previous isolated studies have shown that
rates of premarital pregnancy vary systematically with age, occupational status, ruralurban residence, marriage officiant, religion,
and race; but none have analyzed these
variables simultaneously for the same population over time to see how they produce
their effects. In general, the literature indicates a negative relationship between age at
marriage and premarital pregnancy (Christensen, 1963a; Lowrie, 1965; U.S. Public
Health Service, 1970; Monahan, 1960),
although several of these studies indicate a
slightly curvilinear association, with the
highest incidences of premarital pregnancy
at the youngest and oldest extremes of
those marrying for the first time.
Christensen and Meissner (1953),
Dooghe (1968), and Monahan (1960)
have all shown a clear inverse relationship
between premarital pregnancy and occupational status (or a similar indicator of

185

socioeconomic status) for whites. However,
in controlling for race, the Monahan study
found no similar trend for blacks.

Data on rural-urban differences are very
scanty, principally due to classification
problems resulting from migration. There
is slight evidence for higher rates of premarital pregnancy for urban residents than
rural farm residents (Christensen, 1953).
Kinsey et al. (1948, p. 455) also found that
urban males at all age and occupational
levels were more frequently involved in premarital intercourse than were rural males.
This higher rate of intercourse does not
necessarily imply that urban males are
more frequently involved in premarital
pregnancy.

Pratt (1965), Christensen (19635), and
Monahan (1960) have shown that premarital pregnancy occurs more frequently in
couples eventually married by civil ceremonies than in those married by religious
ceremonies, when the couples are white.
However, Monahan found for blacks that
rates of premarital pregnancy were higher
for those married by religious ceremonies
than those married by civil ceremonies. It
should be noted that the marriage officiant
is of no use as a predictor of premarital
pregnancy, since the pregnancy precedes
the marriage ceremony.

One study has related religion to premarital pregnancy (Barber, 1967) and
showed that in religiously homogeneous
marriages Protestants had the highest rate,
Catholics an intermediate rate, and Jews
the lowest rate of premarital pregnancy.
The same study also found that rates of
premarital pregnancy were slightly higher
for interfaith than intrafaith marriages.

Race has been found to be strongly
related to premarital pregnancy with blacks
displaying higher rates than whites (USS.
Department of Health, Education and Welfare, 1962; U.S. Public Health Service,
1970; Monahan, 1960), No research has

been done on premarital pregnancy rates
for interracial marriages.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The parent populations for the present
study consisted of all marriages and births
in the state of Indiana for the years 196267. There were approximately 286,000
marriage records and 550,000 birth records
provided by the Indiana State Board of
Health on magnetic tape prepared from the
vital records of the state. From the parent
marriage population were selected all records for Lake County, Indiana (Gary,
Hammond, East Chicago, etc.), in which
(1) the marriage license was issued in Lake
County and/or the groom listed Lake
County as his county of residence, and (2)
the record indicated a first marriage for
both bride and groom. Lake County was
selected for study because of the social and
cultural heterogeneity of its population.
The application of these criteria reduced
the parent marriage population to 19,325
cases (see Table 1 for the characteristics of
this population).

From the parent birth population were
selected all records meeting the following
criteria: (1) all cases in which the birth
was attributed to a resident of Lake County
(whether or not it occurred there); (2) all
cases meeting the previous criterion which
represented a first birth to the mother; (3)
all cases meeting the two previous criteria
which were classified as legitimate by the
birth attendant. Application of these criteria reduced the birth population to 14,275
cases.

The marriage and birth files obtained in
this way were then linked on a 32K IBM
7094-1 using a modification of two-staged
linkage methods developed in studies by
Newcombe et al. (1959), Newcombe and
Kennedy (1962), and Kennedy et al.
(1964). Comparison of the marriage file of
19,325 records and the birth file of 14,275

records yielded 6,943 linked records which
were accepted initially or on the detailed
comparisons. Removal of linkages with
negative weights from the detailed comparisons (indicating a low probability of
the validity of the linkage) left 6,359
marriage-birth linkages. Thus, first births
were found for 32.9% of all marriages
(45.2% for 1962 marriages alone). Failure
to match could have been the result of
migration out of the search area after martriage there, no birth during the period for
which the records were searched, or mistakes in the records which caused valid
linkages to be rejected as invalid.

DETERMINATION OF PREMARITAL PREGNANCY

In determining percentages of premarital
pregnancy for a population with record
linkage, the Jength of record search must
be taken into account because short interval searches include a relatively higher
proportion of short interval births, thus
artificially inflating the proportion classified as premaritally pregnant. In the
present study, search spans varied from
zero to a maximum of six years. It is possible, however, to determine the magnitude
and direction of bias caused by the inclusion of short search spans from the data in
Table 2.

This table compares the composite population (1962~67 marriages) with the 1962
marriage population alone on the distribution of relevant characteristics. Column
%A-%B indicates percentage differences
between the distributions, with positive
deviations indicating overrepresentation of
a particular level of a variable in the composite population, relative to what the
linkages for the 1962 marriage population
alone indicated.

In the present study, two criteria were
employed simultaneously in the determination of premarital-postmarital pregnancy.
The first was the interval between marriage

and birth of the first child (4;= Dy —
Dy); where D, is date of birth and Dy», is
date of marriage. No negative values were
possible because the validity of linkages
was based, in part, upon the date of marriage preceding the date of birth. A negative value would have indicated an illegitimate birth as opposed to a premarital
pregnancy. The second criterion was the
weight of the infant at birth. These criteria
were combined according to a method developed by Pratt (1965) in which specific
birth-weight cutting points are associated
with time intervals between marriage and
birth. This information along with the
calculation procedures was put into a subroutine of the linkage program so that
pregnancy category was determined automatically. The definitions of premarital
(P;) and postmarital (P2) pregnancy used
here are as follows:

Py = [04 < 195] or
P, — (ty = 295] or

where: P;= premarital pregnancy; P2=
postmarital pregnancy; ¢, — time interval
between marriage of the couple and birth
of the first child (in days); W> = weight of
the infant at birth (in grams); W, = birth
weight cutting point from Table 3 (in
grams). Table 3 contains the time intervals
and their respective birth-weight cutting
points.

This method of assignment is based upon
three assumptions which are stated below
(Pratt, 1965, p. 164).

1. The interval from marriage to first birth
is uncorrelated with birth weight. Other
things being equal (such as age and race
of the woman), first births at any one
week after marriage will have the same
distribution by gestation and birth weight
as first births at any other week.

2. Birth weight is approximately normally
distributed within each week of gestation.

3. Births in the sampled population have a
distribution of birth weight and gesta

tion similar to that for a selected clinical
population for which reasonably reliable
data on gestation as well as birth weight

[196 <4, 294 and W,>W,);
[196<

can be obtained. This assumption is required precisely because we cannot obtain accurate gestational data from birth
records.
The third assumption above is concerned
with the similarity between the clinical
population for which data are available
and the actual population to which they are
applied. More recent research (Gruenwaid,
1968; Myrianthopoulos and Naylor, 1967)
has shown that human birth weight is a
function of racial, age, and socioeconomic
factors. Infants born to blacks, younger
mothers, and mothers of lower socioeconomic status tend to weigh less than those
born to whites, older mothers, and mothers
of higher socioeconomic status, Thus, the
present method used to estimate premarital
pregnancy may slightly underestimate the
actual frequency for blacks, younger
mothers, and mothers of lower socioeconomic status.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Nominal variables may be used in linear
multiple regression analysis after converting
them to binary form (Kendall, 1961).
These binary variables are then used to
estimate the intercept in the linear model.
When binary variables alone are used as
independent variables and the dependent
variable is continuous with the error term
normally distributed, the regression model
is equivalent to the analysis of variance
model (Cook, 1971).

Regression models with binary dependent variables violate one of the assumptions underlying linear regression analysis—
that the error term is homoscedastic. Goldberger (1964) has shown, however, that
this liability does not bias the estimate of
the regression coefficients, but it does lower
the efficiency of the parameter estimates.
This should be taken into account in the
interpretation of the 6 coefficients obtained
in the present analysis.

The structural equation in which premarital pregnancy is the variable to be explained has the following form:

Y= xo-+BiXi + BoXe
+ B3X3....-+ BaoX20 + €

where: Y = premarital pregnancy; «9 =
intercept; X14==groom’s age; Xs57=
groom’s occupational status; Xs_19 = residence (husband’s and wife’s); Xi1-14=
religion (husband’s and wife’s); X15-17
= ethnicity (husband’s and wife’s) ; X13-20
= race (husband’s and wife’s); B;—= 120 = parameters to be estimated; and e =
error term.

premarital pregnancy because of the inclusion of short record search spans. The
relative positions of categories should not
be affected however (see Table 2 for estimates of the direction and magnitude of
bias).

The expected direct relationship was
found between age at marriage and rate of
premarital pregnancy, with the high of
62.6% found for grooms 18 and less and
the low of 16.4% for those 25 and more.

The relationship for race was also as
expected. The highest rate of 54.6% was
found for blacks and the lowest of 23.7%
for whites. The interracial marriages (7 =
15) had a premarital pregnancy rate inter

mediate between those of the racially
homogeneous marriages (33.3%). Thus,
premarital pregnancy is more likely to
occur in interracial than white marriages,
but less likely than in homogeneous black
marriages.

The expected inverse relationship between occupational status and premarital
pregnancy appeared, but the difference between the medium and low levels was very
small (0.8%). The introduction of age as
a test variable into the basic relationship
(those at the younger age levels are less
likely to have completed training which
would allow them to score high on a scale
of occupational status) revealed a more
curvilinear relationship with the highest
rate for the medium occupational status
level and the lowest for the high and low
levels (Table 5). Thus, either coding probJems in the vital records are obscuring the
relationship, or there is no particularly
marked relationship between occupational
status and premarital pregnancy for the
total population.

Premarital Pregnancy

191

For the intrafaith marriages, Protestants
had the highest rate of premarital pregnancy (32.5%), Catholics an intermediate
rate (18.2%) and Jews the lowest rate
(16.7%). Intrafaith marriages taken together had a lower rate of premarital pregnancy (27.5%) than did interfaith marriages (34.3%). All of the findings with
respect to religion were congruent with
expectation.

A surprising finding was that foreignborn couples had a higher rate of premarital
pregnancy than did couples of mixed
ethnicity (21.1% versus 17.9%). Introduction of religion as a test variable into
the basic relationship revealed that foreignborn Catholics had a rate of premarital
pregnancy almost twice as high as foreignborn Protestants (Table 6). It is likely that
these Catholics are relatively recent arrivals
from Central America and Puerto Rico,
given the incidence of Spanish surnames in
the marriage and birth records. Additional
analysis, however, would be required to

ascertain whether or not this is actually the
case.

Another result congruent with expectation (but with no previous data for comparison) was the highest rate of premarital
pregnancy for urban couples (28.9%), an
intermediate rate for couples of mixed
residence (21.4%), and the lowest rate for
rural couples (19.1%). This analysis is of
particular importance in that it overcomes
the bias found in previous descriptive analyses which determine rates of premarital
pregnancy for geographic areas rather than
for individuals.

REGRESSION ANALYSIS

Table 7 contains the results of the binary
regression analysis and indicates that a

total of 14.96% of the variance in the dependent variable was explained by the
independent variables used here. Age and
race accounted for 92% of this with r°
values of 7.86 and 5.92% respectively.
None of the other variables accounted for
more than 1% of the variance, and altogether they accounted for only 1.18%.
Thus, despite the interesting relationships
described in the previous section, the variables used here have little value, by themselves, in predicting premarital pregnancy.
The beta weights in Table 7 also bear
noting. The highest weight of 0.4169 was
found for the comparison between grooms
18 or less with those 25 or older. The next
highest weight was found for the comparison of grooms age 18 or less with those age

comparisons and the black-white race comparison yielded ¢ values which were significant at the 0.001 level. In addition, the
other-rural category for the residence variable was significant at the 0.001 level. Because of the relatively large number of
cases in the “Other” category, additional
work needs to be done to determine who

the “Others” are. Two other regression coefficients were significant at the 0.05 level,
those involving the mixed racial and black
comparison and urban-rural residence comparison. The only other comparisons which
approached statistical significance involved
occupational status and the mixed residence
category.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

The present study has analyzed the distribution and correlates of premarital pregnancy in Lake County, Indiana, for couples
married between January 1, 1962 and
December 31, 1967. The descriptive analysis showed that premarital pregnancy rates
were highest for marriages in which the
groom was 18 years of age or less, both
spouses were Protestant (for intrafaith marriages), both spouses were born in the
United States, and both lived in an urban
area at the time of marriage. The multiple
regression analysis of the same data found
that only 14.96% of the variance in the
dependent variable was explained by the

 

Social Biology

predictor variables used here, and 92% of
that was attributable to age and race (7? =
7.86% and 5.92% respectively).

Thus, despite the interesting descriptive
relationships found, the variables used here
accounted for little of the variance in the
dependent variable. The next step in the
investigation of premarital pregnancy should
involve attitude variables in addition to
the statistically significant structural variables found here. In a sense, the present
study tapped these attitudes, because it is
certainly not age or race in themselves
which is determining premarital pregnancy,
but rather constellations of attitudes
(values) associated with particular levels
of these variables. In addition, interactions
between the structural variables used here
need to be examined.
