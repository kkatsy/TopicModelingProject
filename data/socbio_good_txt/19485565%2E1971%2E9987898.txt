Sexual Frequency and Contraceptive Pills

The purpose of this paper is to report the
effects of contraceptive pills on the frequency of sexual activity as observed during
a double-blind placebo study in which various parameters of behavior were noted
daily.

In studies previous to this, we obtained
evidence suggesting that estrogen increases
and progesterone decreases the probability
of sexual activity in humans (Udry and
Morris, 1968). A large body of data shows
that these hormones do thus influence
mating behavior in Rhesus monkeys (Michael, 1968). It follows that because of their
hormonal nature, contraceptive pills might
biologically affect sexual behavior. Michael
(1968) has shown this is indeed the case in
the Rhesus. When the female monkey receives a combined mestranol and ethynodiol
diacetate contraceptive, her male partner
becomes less and less efficient in reaching
ejaculation, and after six or seven months
may not ejaculate at all despite prolonged
efforts. When she receives mestranol, then
mestranol with chlormadinone acetate in
sequential fashion, her partner becomes less
efficient but is not quite so handicapped as
in the former instance (Michael, 1969).

In humans, in all careful studies to date
of the side effects of contraceptive pills, it
has been concluded that there is no signifi
40

cant effect on sexual behavior. When
changes have been reported, they have usually related to a small proportion of the women studied, and they are about as likely to
consist of an increase as a decrease. Behavior has been measured in terms of subjective
changes in female libido, or subjective assessment of changes in average frequency of
intercourse, through questions such as, “For
the last cycle, please indicate whether you
had orgasm nevev......, sometimes......, or frequent......, whether you had intercourse once
per month......, twice per month......, once a

whether your libido was frigid....... weak......,
or marked........"., Methodological problems
seriously limit the reliability of previous
findings in humans (Garcia, 1967; Wallach,
1968; Goldzieher, 1968; Rodgers and Ziegler,
1968; Nilsson and Solvell, 1968; Bakke,
1965; Kane 1969; Kane, Treadway, and
Ewing, 1969).

One study, however, is particularly convincing concerning the potential of certain
oral contraceptives to cause decrease of sexual activity. Grant and Mears (1967) recorded the complaints of women receiving
many different contraceptive agents and
found that highly progestogenic formulations (combined pills) caused up to 34% of
those taking them to complain of depression

and loss of libido, while highly estrogenic
regimes (sequentials) caused these complaints far less often. Now that highly estrogenic pills are suspect because of an apparently greater association with thromboembolic disease, it is even more important to
find out whether or not progestogenic contraceptives affect sexual activity, and how
much progestogen it takes. We selected for
this experiment agents containing 2 mg of
norethindrone, an amount of progestogen
much Jess than those used in earlier formulations, but more than that in current use
or projected for the future.

In this study we assume that physiological effects on sexual behavior due to contraceptive pills will be prominent during the
first two cycles of use, as are other physiological effects about which complaints are
common (nausea, tender breasts, breakthrough bleeding, etc.) (Goldzieher, 1968;
Tyler et al., 1964, 1966; Board, 1966). Psychological effects are controlled through the
use of a placebo comparison group.

Although long-range physiological effects
on sexual behavior also deserve attention,
we cannot address ourselves to this problem
here. Masters and Johnson have anecdotally
reported that after two to three years of
contraceptive pill use some women find it
more difficult to attain orgasm (see McCary, 1967). Since progesterone in large
doses is said to have a sedative effect on female sexual behavior (Greenblatt, 1952), we
look to our data to show whether a small
dose will directly influence female response.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Married women currently contracepting
by some method other than the use of a contraceptive pill were recruited to take part in
the study. Women were not accepted: if
they had used a contraceptive pill or had
been pregnant in the previous three months;
if they had used a contraceptive pill in the
past, but had to give it up because of side
effects or medical contraindications; or if

Sexual Frequency 41

they had some contraindication to oral contraceptive use at the time of the study.
Twenty-five participants were recruited
from a group of women attending public
family-planning clinics and forty-five were
recruited through invitations to graduatestudent wives and to women in a religious
congregation. The women were paid to
participate. Of the 70 women originally recruited, 7 dropped out on their own (2 because of weight loss and cramps, respectively, which they attributed to to the medication; and 5 presumably because of changing
their minds about participating), and 7 were
asked to drop out by the research staff because of failure to follow directions accurately. The final group consisted of 56 women,
15 from the clinics and 41 from the other
groups. Of the 56, 5 were flagged because of
irregularities in their data contributions and
were dropped from the analysis reported
here. It should be noted that adding their
data does not significantly affect the results.
Graduate-student wives were most heavily
represented in the 51 remaining.

The women were randomly divided into
three groups. All were to record daily on a
data slip covering the previous 24 hours
whether or not they had menstruated,
whether they had had intercourse and/or
orgasm, their daily mileage clocked on a
pedometer, and the answers to questions
about how they felt and whether or not their
husbands had wanted intercourse. These
slips were mailed into the research office
daily in pre-stamped, pre-addressed envelopes.

For the first cycle of participation (beginning with the first day of a menstrual period
and bracketed by the next menstrual bleeding), the women in all three groups wore
pedometers and sent in their daily slips. After the first cycle, one group took mestranol
0.1 mg combined with norethindrone 2.0 mg
(Ortho-Novum-2); the second group took
0.08 mg mestranol, then in the last six pills
of each cycle 0.08 mg mestranol combined

with 2 mg norethindrone (Ortho-Novum
SQ); and the third group took lactose
placebos.

The lactose and the active pills were each
stuffed into capsules and looked identical;
they did not resemble commercial contraceptive pills. The capsules were given the
participants in beaded strands of sixty, with
instructions to take them continously in
consecutive order according to the numbering on the strands, until they were all used
up. Women taking capsules containing active ingredients were actually taking them
on a 20-day-on, 8-day-off cycle, the intervening capsules being stuffed with lactose.

Stuffing of the capsules, capsule numbering, and random assignment of the women
to groups were done by the university hospital pharmacy in order to ensure a doubleblind study. Since we were focusing on
side-effects and not on contraceptive efficiency, there was no problem in managing a
double-blind placebo study. Participants
were reminded that they must continue
their usual method of contraception, since
neither they nor the investigators would
know whether the medication they were
taking could protect them from pregnancy.

All the women sent in data for at least
three cycles, one on no medication and two
during which they took the capsules. Women taking combination pills were invited
to continue for a fourth cycle, during which
time, unknown to them but known to the
investigators, they would be given placebo.

Social Biology

These women were singled out because, as
suggested above, a more progestogenic medication was expected to cause a greater incidence of “decreased libido” than the more
estrogenic formulation, and we wanted to
be able to demonstrate, in those most apt to
be affected, recovery from the possible hormonally-induced depression of sexual activity. Ten women agreed to continue for this
fourth cycle.

Characteristics of the women are shown
in Table 1.

RESULTS

this latter amounts to the number of days

in the cycle. When data were missing, however, for any cycle day, calculations were
based only on those days for which data
were available. There was no significant
difference in the frequency of intercourse
across the three groups of women or between
one cycle and any of the others (two-tailed
i-test applied; P = 0.05 level of probability
used for determination of significance
throughout the analysis).

as indicated above. There was no significant

the three groups of women or between one
cycle and any of the others.

also reported. Although it appears that the
group receiving the placebo had a lower rate
of orgasm per intercourse, there was no significant difference among the three groups
or between any of the cycles compared to
any other.

In order to discover whether age might
influence the effects of the contraceptive
pills, the data were analyzed as above after
breaking into halves at the median age. No
changes emerged.

Because of the allegation that contraceptive pills affect the capacity of women to
respond with orgasm and because our initial
analysis revealed no change, we divided the
groups according to whether the women’s
orgasm rates were above or below the
median rate and looked to see whether perhaps the response of more orgasmic women
was affected differently from that of less orgasmic women. No difference appeared.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The women participating in this study
knew that they might be in a group receiving placebo only and that although the pills
being studied were oral contraceptives, they
had to continue their regular method of contraception to avoid pregnancy. We believe
this situation tended to minimize the women’s expectations for any change in sexual
activity due to the medication; at least it
did not cause alteration in the usual pattern
of coitus-related preparation.

It is possible that women who had used
oral contraceptives in the past and felt their
sexual lives had been adversely affected did
not volunteer to take part in the study
(causing an underrepresentation of susceptible women). Women reporting any serious
reactions were discouraged from participating. On the other hand, several volunteers
stated they felt that the pills had affected
their emotional well-being in the past, and
they were interested in the experiment to
find out if it had been “all in the mind.” At
the end they were informed what they had
been given and were allowed to judge for
themselves. The most serious appearing and
persistent complaints came from two women who were given placebo. There actually
were no complaints relating to “libido” or
sexual frequency.

Our data for the first two cycles of use of
these particular oral contraceptives are
clear: Average sexual frequency is not affected. Considering that 2 mg of norethindrone is a considerably larger amount of
progestogen than that in current use in combined pills, and a tremendously greater
amount than the microdoses projected for
the future, the results suggest that depres
Social Biology

sion of sexual frequency due to a direct physiological effect of progestogens used as contraceptive agents will not be a problem.
This does not preclude changes which might
occur later, perhaps secondary to other effects of the hormonal contraceptives on the
body.

We believe this study makes one further
contribution. It demonstrates a means of
separating physiological and psychological
effects of contraceptive pills, a problem
which has been considered very difficult but
necessary to solve (Wallach and Garcia,
1968; Kane et al., 1969).

SUMMARY

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of contraceptive pills on the
frequency of sexual activity. Fifty-one married women contracepting by some means
other than contraceptive pills were divided
at random into three groups to receive placebo, mestranol 0.1 mg and norethindrone
2 mg, or mestranol 0.08 mg, then mestranol
0.08 mg with norethindrone 2 mg, in a
double-blind fashion for two cycles, after
one cycle of observation without medication. Reports of sexual intercourse, orgasm,
and other data were mailed daily to the investigators. No significant change in average
sexual frequency was observed as a consequence of the medication.
