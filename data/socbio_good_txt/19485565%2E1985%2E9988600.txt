Relationships Among Companies of Militia in
the Colony of New York in 1760 Estimated by an

Analysis of Their Surnames

ABSTRACT: Surname, analysis, a technique to estimate genetic relatedness, is applied here to
differences within and between eight militia companies (N = 782) mustered for New York Colony in 1760. Universal service laws of the time imply that militias are unbiased community
samples. Colonial American populations are of interest due to their heterogeneous migrant origins, balanced by effects of large kin groups. The surname of each militiaman was checked for
identity to that of all others within and between the eight companies. Assuming surnames derive from common ancestry, fractions of name identity index relatedness. Within-company relatedness is high, below only that found in genetic isolates, probably due to enlistments together
of kinsmen. Between-company relatedness is the lowest yet recorded, apparently because of the

diverse origins of these populations.

One of the objectives of biological
anthropology is to determine the origins
of the differences found within our species. Considerable research has been
done on smal! relatively isolated groups,
but studies of national populations are
much more difficult. Furthermore, tracing genetic and anthropometric traits
sometimes can point to relationships.
Over longer time spans, however, environmental changes (including those
based on changes in the culture) may
not only influence morphological characteristics but may also alter the optimal
fitness of good genetic traits and lead to
changes in the equilibrium values for
polymorphisms such as blood groups.
Despite well-known limitations (e.g.,
Morton et al., 1976; Ellis and Starmer,
1978; Lasker, 1978a, Roberts and Roberts, 1983; Weiss et al., 1983), an analysis of surname distributions can easily
reveal something of the genetic structure of those societies which have used

hereditary surnames for some length of
time. The method can also be applied to
historical populations (c.f. Sedlund,
1971; Souden and Laster, 1978; Kiichemann et al., 1979; Swedlund and Boyce,
1983).

Potentially, the surname method can
also be applied to historical data to estimate degrees of relationship among
groups of people other than samples of
breeding populations. In this note we
examine the surname patterns of men
listed in eight company muster rolls of
militia in the colony of New York in the
year 1760 to attempt to estimate
whether relatives tended to enlist together (Third Ann. Rep., N.Y.S. Historian, 1898).

could best be described by a half matrix
comparing every individual with every
other. Since surnames apply only to
male lines of descent, coefficients of relationship among surnames only sample
a tiny fraction of lines of descent even
within a modest period of time (less than
one in a billion in thirty generations), so
the method can only lead to statistical
statements about populations. To reach
these statements we can compare the
surname of every individual with that of
every other and score the fraction that
are identical as in Figure 1.

surnames from a common ancestor) the
genetic relationship of the men of one
company to those of the other would be
estimated as half of 4/36 by the logic established by Crow (1980). In this example the first five names are drawn from
Captain Clinton’s Company raised in
Ulster County, N.Y. and the remaining
four names are from Captain Mor’s
Company raised in the County of
Queens. Thus, the relationship can be
partitioned: 3 of 10 squares, hence a relationship coefficient of 1/2 x 3/10 =
0.15, within the Ulster County Company, zero in 6 = Qin the small sample
from Queens, and 1/2 X 1/20 = 0.025 be

tween the two groups. In this way we
have calculated the commonality of surnames among all the men and officers in
eight companies of New York Militia.

RESULTS

Table 1 shows within-company relationships compared with that between
companies. How do we interpret these
results? First of all, the within-company
relationship is high. Only genetic isolates studied yield higher levels of relationship (c.f. Crow and Mange, 1965).
The high value within companies of the
colonial militia may result from brothers
and other close kin joining up together.

New York law required that all men
enlist themselves in a local militia company (Vollmer 1947), so we consider
these records to be unbiased samples of
local male populations. Since names
were recorded on the militia rolls in no
obvious order, we are assuming that the
mustering officer simply had the men
line up and enrolled them as they appeared. A common pattern is the sequential listing of four of five German
Social Biology

born men, a group of Irish together, and
so on — precisely how you would expect
a group of men to sort themselves in a
line. More to the point, men of identical
surname often appear serially on the roll
of a specific company. This implies relatedness; but we must make both conservative and liberal estimates of this relatedness since we have been unable to find
further corroborative evidence. Our
most limited assumption (which minimizes the estimate of close kin) includes
only a few pairs where there is at least a
twenty-year age difference between the
two, and the son is identified (“‘Issack
Betherton, Issack Betherton, Jr.”’). Of
the 782 men in the eight companies
there are only four pairs which fit this
criterion among 610,742 possible pairs
of men. We believe that this figure underestimates the number of close kin.

A more realistic assessment is arrived
at in the following way. Within companies, those men of the same surname who
appear serially and who are close in age
may be assumed, for this argument, to
be brothers. There were 34 such men in
17 pairs, plus 6 additional men in two tri

ple sets (which produce an additional 6
“brother” pairs). Overall, then, there
are 40 “brothers” in 23 pairs. To these
and the 4 father-son pairs mentioned
above one can add 3 other “father-son”
pairs where there are 2 men of the same
surname appearing together on the roll,
but with age differences of at least 20
years. Thus, there were 27 pairs of first
degree relationship among 610,742 possible pairings. Since first degree kin have
a coefficient of relationship of 0.5, the
average coefficient from these pairs is
22.1 x 10~°.

As a much broader index of relatedness, we simply counted all of the pairs
who shared the same surname by the
method shown in Figure 1. From these
we calculated the coefficients of relationship shown in Table 1. Assuming
that kinsmen on the mother’s, mother’s
mother’s and father’s mother’s side etc.
are as likely to have enlisted together as
those on the father’s side, each pair with
the same surname represents as much
kinship in the population as a pair of
brothers and the average relationship
rises to 1218 X 10~° within company and
345 x 10-° between companies as
shown in Table 1. Thus, the surname
analysis suggests more than an order of
magnitude relationship among these
men—even between different
companies—than that deduced from
trying to identify fathers, sons, and
brothers.

CONCLUSION

Relationship by isonymy between
companies is the lowest yet recorded.
Oxfordshire (Kiichemann et al., 1979)
and Kent (Souden and Lasker, 1978)
villages had higher values in the eight

eenth and nineteenth centuries. The low
values between companies are obviously caused by the heterogeneous origins of the recruits rather than by isolation of the regions where the militia
units were recruited. Only 31.1 per cent
were born in the colony of New York,
an additional 28.7 per cent were born in
other colonies, 4.4 per cent in England
and Wales, 19.6 per cent in Ireland, 1.7
per cent in Scotland, 12.8 per cent in
Germany, and the remaining 1.7 per
cent in France, Holland, Italy, and the
West Indies. Since there is essentially no
commonality of surnames between
these European countries (and very little intermarriage in the period since hereditary surnames were established),
this offsets the inclusion of relatives in
the military units and gives a modest
overall level of relationship of 0.00046—
the same as Raspe and Lasker (1980) reported between the Scilly Isles and
mainland England and Wales and approximately the same as found in the cities of Reading and Kidlington in England today (Lasker, 1978); Lasker et
al., 1979). The levels of relationship between companies of the colonial militia
of New York in 1760 are thus among the
lowest reported anywhere and reflect
the very diverse origin of the colonists.
