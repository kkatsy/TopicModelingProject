Low-migration Standard Metropolitan
Statistical Areas

ABSTRACT: Socioeconomic determinants of fertility and mortality were estimated by regression
analysis for 29 low-migration SMSA’s located in the eastern part of the U. S. A low-migration
sample was chosen to maximize length of life history within the regions. Independent variables
included per cent nonwhite, gross and net migration, population, density, medical care, welfare,
per cent Catholic, education, income, and labor force participation. Density was measured by an
index based on the census inventory of urban land. Mortality results include effects of migration
on older nonwhite life expectancy, an inverse effect of density on life expectancy for older whites,
specific income and educational effects on older life expectancies, different causative factors for
e(50) and e(1,50), lack of influence of medical care (except for the nonwhite male), and significant
infant mortality multiple correlations only for the nonwhite female. For nonwhite fertility, the
inverse influences of per cent nonwhite and net migration 1960—70 were of greatest importance.
White fertility showed a negative relationship with medical care and a positive one with nonwhite

male e(0).

The present study looks at regional,
ethnic, and socioeconomic differences in
1970 mortality and period fertility for 29
U.S. Standard Metropolitan Statistical
Areas characterized by low in-migration
and net migration from 1960-70. No prior
work has coincided with this research in
all aspects of design, although a relatively
small number of past investigations have
partially overlapped it.

An early regional fertility study was
Keyfitz’ comparison (1952 and 1953) of
fertility and distance from the city for
French Catholic families in Quebec and
English Protestant families in Ontario.
For each cultural group, a small sample of
individual families was studied by a compartmental analysis of variance technique.

Collver and Langlois (1962) concluded
that among a varied group of nations fertility was inversely correlated with female
labor force participation. A similar nega
tive result was shown by Collver (1968) for
all ages of mother and for both whites and
nonwhites in a sample of 65 SMSA’s
in 1960. The negative correlation was
stronger for whites and in younger
childbearing ages.

Biggar and Butler (1969) did a multiple
correlation and regression analysis of fertility for all North Carolina counties in
1960. White fertility was shown to be
primarily related to population characteristics (positively to population change,
1950-60, and to per cent white women of
ages 15~44) whereas nonwhite 1960 fertility was strongly linked to population and
socioeconomic factors (negatively to nonwhite per capita income and positively to
per cent nonwhite farm workers).

Heer and Turner (1965) performed regressions of fertility, measured by the
child-woman ratio, against eight population, labor force, and literacy variables for

69

70

local administrative units in eighteen
Latin American nations. Closer to the
present investigation was a later study by
Heer and Boynton (1970) of differences in
fertility in 591 U.S. counties in 1960. Fertility was measured as the ratio of actual to
expected births. Variables found to have
the greatest contribution to r? were per
cent Roman Catholic (positive factor), a
density index (negative), and proportion
nonwhite (positive).

In a study of the effect of ten demographic and socioeconomic characteristics
on the total fertility rate in 1961 for 29
regions of the Italian province of Venezia
(De Sandre, 1971), the independent variables of most importance for regression (in
order of size of standardized coefficients)
were per cent of voters Christian Democrat (positive), amount of urban centralization (negative), persons per room
(positive), per cent with secondary
education (positive), and female employment (negative).

In a nonregional research project on
ethnic and age differences in fertility (children ever born) for the entire United
States in 1960 and 1970, Pohlmann (unpublished) attributed the greatest importance to age at first marriage. However,
the use of a cohort measure would appear
to account for much of the explanatory
power of this variable. For whites in 1970,
female income was clearly second in
influence, but for Blacks several variables
were of secondary significance, particularly female education and housing adequacy.

Regional studies of mortality are even
fewer in number than those of fertility. In
England, Melvin-Howe’s investigation
(1968) of geographic differences in
mortality used the excellent data of the
British National Health Service. The
mortality measure chosen was death rate
standardized against the age distribution
of the whole British population. The areas

Pick

Social Biology

picked were not uniform, but a mixture of
geographical units, such as towns, counties, etc. A regional trend towaru higher
mortality in the northwest of England and
Wales was noted. Using the census tracts
of Houston for areas, Roberts et al. (1970)
correlated the variables of social class, per
cent Black, and per cent Spanish surname
against mortality for six disease categories
and total death rate. Both social class and
ethnicity were concluded to be factors
influencing mortality levels of various
diseases.

The major differences of the present research from the past studies just reviewed
are the mode of sample selection (low
in-migration areas), the inclusion of both
mortality and fertility as dependent variables, the division of mortality indices into
various portions of the life span, and the
introduction of a density index standardized for land use. The present research
determines the relationships of white and
nonwhite life expectancy and period fertility to each other and to seventeen population and socioeconomic variables for selected metropolitan areas in 1970. The criteria for choice of SMSA’s in the sample
was low gross and net in-migration 1960—
70. It was reasoned that in metropolitan
areas with higher levels of in-migration,
local vital rates do not reflect adequately
the area’s own social and _ health
conditions, but are altered by a large
component in the population of recent
in-migrants who are heavily affected in
their present vital rates by previous fertility and mortality factors from other regions. These migrants are assumed to take
varying periods for assimilation. This
past-history determinant has _ been
documented for fertility (Matras, 1973),
socioeconomic characteristics in Argentina
(Germani, 1966), and in the United States
among Blacks (Beale, 1971).

The exact criteria for selection of
SMSA’s were the following: (1) less than

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 24, No. 1

15 per cent net in-migration 1960-70 for
the white and nonwhite populations taken
separately; and (2) less than 16.1 per cent
gross in-migration 1965-70 for whites and
less than 10.6 per cent gross in-migration
1965-70 for Blacks (in both cases, excluding annexation). The following additional
criterion was also imposed: (3) The nonwhite population must exceed 13,500.
This allows sufficient size to compute fertility and mortality rates for five-year age
groups. Thirty-one SMSA’s were selected,
and all happened to be located in the eastern half of the United States. However,
the New Haven and Bridgeport SMSA’s
did not have proper age-specific birth
statistics due to their complicated township composition and were excluded. In
Table 1, in-migration levels for the sample
are compared with those of 73 other
SMSA’s not included in the sample.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Eighteen dependent and 17 independent
variables were chosen. The variables and
their values are shown in Table 2.
Dependent variables 1-4, 17, and 18 were
also included as independent variables in
two or more of the regressions. The mode
of calculation and justification of choice of
these factors are given below. For
dependent variables:

Y1 Life expectancy from age 0, e(0),
for white males in the SMSA.
e(0) for white females in the

SMSA.

Y3 e(0) for nonwhite males in the
SMSA.
Y4 e(0) for nonwhite females in the

SMSA.

males in the SMSA.

Infant mortality rate for nonwhite
males in the SMSA.

Y14 e(50) for nonwhite males in the

Y15 e(50) for white females in the
SMSA.

Y16 e(50) for nonwhite females in the
SMSA.

Y17 Gross reproduction rate (GRR) of
the white population.

Y18 GRR of the nonwhite population.

The above were calculated using standard demographic computer programs
(Keyfitz and Flieger, 1971) from five-year
population data (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1973), and from five-year fertility data
and five- and ten-year mortality statistics
(National Center for Health Statistics,
1974). The ten-year data were divided into
five-year periods by linear interpolation of
the national five-year white and nonwhite,
male and female, age distributions in
1970. Life expectancy was considered the
best general standardized measure of
mortality at a single time point.

Prior studies used as indices of fertility:
period measures (crude birth rate, total
fertility rate, child-woman ratio), cohort
measures (children ever born), and a
period index including birth expectation
(ratio of actual to expected births). A
cohort measure was not chosen because
this study intended to look at the immediate effect of 1970 socioeconomic factors on the fertility of the entire age range
of women associated with a region. Cohort

the women were living elsewhere. The (1965-70).

GRR was considered superior to other
measures because it averages five-year
rates for the whole childbearing period.

The independent variables were:

X19 Per cent of population nonwhite
(nonwhite population divided
by total population).

X20 Net migration rate (1960-70).

The latter is calculated by the vital rate

method of subtraction of natural increase
1960—70 from total increase 1960-70 (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 1971).

The latter was for the non-Negro
portion of the population (U.S. Bureau of
the Census, 1973), which is considered
sufficiently close to the white segment due
to the tiny percentage of other nonwhite
minorities in the metropolitan areas
chosen (see Table 1). The reason for including both net and gross in-migration,
each for a different time span, is that these
are the only sets of SMSA migration data
available for 1960-70, and they measure
somewhat different groups of migrants.

74.

X23 Population size (total population
of the SMSA in 1970).

X24 Population density index.

Many previous studies using land density have calculated density as persons per
square mile for the SMSA. It was felt that
this ratio is inadequate for some comparisons because of the irregular pattern of
land use within these urban areas. One
SMSA, such as Nashville, might be mostly
or entirely within city limits, whereas another might include large amounts of agricultural land, preserve, governmentowned forest or park, or other undeveloped government lands (e.g., Baltimore, Buffalo, Bakersfield, Evansville). A
new density index was constructed which
takes the urbanized area as the basic city
unit. The urbanized area (population
within the city limits plus contiguous incorporated or unincorporated suburban
units of 2,500 population or more per mile
plus certain contiguous suburban areas of
lower density) is a more logical metropolitan unit than population inside city limits,
since it includes the suburban population
found to be of large magnitude in the 1970
census (Hauser, 1971) and to be highly
variable in SMSA’s. The density index is
defined as follows:

Population of urbanized
area plus population of
towns and cities of 2,500
population or more outside
the urbanized area (within
the SMSA) plus the population of the remainder of the
SMSA population (= total
SMSA population).

of the remainder of the
SMSA population (calculated at 1 square mile per
1,000 population).

Data for the index are available (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 1973). The density
estimate of 1,000/square mile for the population outside the urbanized area and
outside other towns or cities was obtained
by averaging census estimates of land
areas of the smallest towns. It is considered that this estimate for rural population
offers greater accuracy than averaging
arbitrary amounts of nonurbanized land
as is done in conventional calculation of
SMSA densities.

X25 Medical care index.

This index is computed as 3.31 X hospital beds per capita plus nonfederal physiclans per capita (American Hospital Association, 1972; Haug et al., 1971). The
weighting factor of 3.31 was calculated to
equalize the separate variances of the two
terms above. These two factors were
chosen over others, such as hospital admissions and hospital daily census,
because it was felt that the latter partially
measure admissions policies and the proportions of inpatient versus outpatient care.
An error introduced into this index is the
lack of standardization for percentage of
persons in the metropolitan area with
substandard health, but no comparative
data exist for such a standardization. The
health care available to nonwhites is less
accurately measured by the above index
than for whites, because it does not show
areas that are particularly strong in
minority group physicians, hospitals, and
medical training (e.g., Nashville) or areas
that are weak.

X26 Welfare (nonwhite).

This variable is estimated as average
public assistance or public welfare income
(for nonwhite families receiving this
income) X per cent of the nonwhite fami

lies receiving this income (U.S. Bureau of
the Census, 1973). A similar variable is
not introduced for the white population,
since the average value of the measure for
whites is so much lower than that for
nonwhite and hence of little demographic
importance.

X27 Per cent in the labor force for the
white male population 16+ in
the SMSA.

X28 Per cent in the labor force for the
white female population 16+ in
the SMSA.

X29 Per cent in the labor force for the
Black male population 16+ in
the SMSA.

X30 Per cent in the labor force for the
Black female population 16+ in
the SMSA.

Data were from the U.S. Bureau of the
Census (1973). Labor force includes unemployed workers, but excludes persons
in school. Again, the statistical error in
substituting Black for nonwhite population is very small.

X31 Per cent Catholic in the SMSA
(compiled from archdiocese records, Glenmary Research
Center, 1976).

X32 Per cent high-school graduates for
whites, 25+ in the SMSA.

X33 Per cent high-school graduates for
Blacks, 25+ in the SMSA.

Bureau of the Census (1973). The white
population was approximated by subtraction of the Black population from the
total.

X34 Income for whites in the SMSA.

X35 Income for Blacks in the SMSA.

The average income of all families and
unrelated individuals for the total and
Black population (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1973) was used to estimate average income of whites by subtracting the
Black total payroll from the SMSA total
payroll and averaging the remainder.

Fertility and Mortality

Some error was introduced by miscounting of nonwhites other than Blacks.

RESULTS

Simple correlations appear in Table 3.
For calculation of fertility and mortality
measures, a computer program was written to sort and interpolate vital statistics
into five-year age groups for input into a
standard Keyfitz and Flieger LIFE and
LOTKA routine. For the independent
variables, software was created to convert
raw census and other data into the
measures employed. All the secondary
data were then analyzed using a
correlation program designed for this
study and the UCLA Biomed step-wise
multiple regression program (Dixon,
1973). Age distributions were studied by
PYRAMID graphics (Pick, 1974) and a
sex—age gap routine.

Before proceeding to the correlations,
results of a separate age structure analysis
should be mentioned. Age structures for
one ethnic group showed little variation
among metropolitan regions. Instead, different features occurred consistently between the white and nonwhite structures
with the most notable differences as follows: (1) the nonwhite age distribution in
each SMSA was more tapered than the
white; (2) the depression age gap is present
for white distributions, with the exception
of Nashville, but is generally flattened or
nonexistent (in one-third of the cases) for
nonwhite distributions; (3) the sex ratio for
age groups 75+ is on the average 29 per
cent larger for nonwhites (Table 4).

In an attempt to understand (3), the
sex—age gap differences in life expectancies
were compared in Table 5. The larger
sex-age gap in e(50) for whites would
partly account for (3), but only complete
historical life expectancy and migration
records could fully explain this effect.

relationships within and between the sets
of dependent variables. For ¢(50), malefemale correlations are significant for
nonwhites but insignificant for whites.
White, nonwhite correlations for ¢(0) and
e(50) are significant only for males. These
results will be explained by the later regressions in which dissimilarity of
explanatory factors between male and female is greater for whites than for nonwhites, and dissimilarity of factors between whites and nonwhites is greater for
females than for males. The lack of any
correlations within the set of e(1,50)’s is
due to greater differences among categories in susceptibilities to suicide, homicide,
accidents, and other common causes of
deaths for ages 1 to 50. The correlation
between GRR(NW) and GRR(W) is quite
high (ry = 0.60). However, it will be shown
below that explanations are quite different
for the two GRR’s.

The only significant correlation between
fertility and mortality occurs between e(0)
(white female) and white GRR (r = 0.53).
Since these relationships are not important
in regression, they are probably caused by
a mutual strong correlation to some third

factor. Correlations between life expectancy variables and the independent variables are consistent with the results of the
regressions and will be taken up below.
The only significant correlation within the
group of infant mortality variables is between infant mortality of nonwhite males
and white females (ry = 0.63). There is no
apparent reason.

A number of important relationships
hold between the independent variables.
Net migration (1960-70) is linked to inmigration of whites (1965~70). Inmigration to these SMSA’s is inversely
related to population size in a feedback
relationship noted by Hauser (1971). As
expected, total population and density are
positively correlated. Labor force participation variables show strong intercorrelations except between males and females
for whites. Income and education variables are also strongly intercorrelated. For
females, there are significant positive
relationships of labor force with net
migration and in-migration. Possibly with
greater influx of migrants, there is more
expansion in business hiring of women.
There is a logical positive relationship be

RESULTS OF THE REGRESSION ANALYSIS

Table 6 summarizes the results of linear
regression analysis. For infant mortality,
the only significant multiple correlation
was for nonwhite females. White income
is the most important contributing factor.
Since infant health care comprises a nexus
of private and public economic-medical
factors, higher white income may tend to
lower relative health benefits for the
nonwhite infant female. The negative
influence of density possibly reflects an
environmental health effect.

As expected from the shape of the mortality curve, there are strong similarities
between e(0) and e(50). The following
analysis for e(0) will apply also to e(50)
unless otherwise noted. Total] life expectancy of white males is most heavily linked
inversely to density and white  inmigration. This density effect is not apparent at younger ages (note results for
e(1,50)). At older ages, density is the
largest factor for whites of both sexes.
That such an effect is negative is possibly
due to a current medical theory that many
health benefits of dense locations are offset
by the resultant environmental pollution,
congestion, stress, noise, etc. (Hexter and
Goldsmith, 1971; Lave and Seskin, 1970;
Selikoff et al., 1968). The negative effect
of white in-migration may be due to competitive stresses from an increasing labor
pool. Similarly, benefits of greater education may ease such competitive factors.

For the older portion of the white male
life span, density dominates in importance, displacing white in-migration and
education. A possible explanation is that
occupational causes of mortality differences, dependent on in-migration and
educational level, become less important
at older ages due to increasing retirement.
Also, perhaps the older white male’s un
Fertility and Mortality 79

usual sensitivity to density is due to his
suburban location, where intracity differences in such environmental effects are
greater than between central cities.

For the white female, a negative effect
of density is again noted, with an explanation similar to that for white males.
There is not the increase in density’s importance above age 50, probably because
of less change in competitive forces at retirement.

For nonwhites, greater similarity in central city environment may reduce the density’s importance. Also, perhaps under the
same density stress healthy nonwhites are
less inclined to leave an SMSA than are
healthy whites.

The negative effect on older white female life expectancy of nonwhite income
may be due to a series of medicaleconomic factors, where relative economic
access to health care may be marginally
lowered with increasing nonwhite income.
The positive influence of nonwhite education may reflect health benefits of higher
educational level in the metropolitan region.

An important variable in accounting for
nonwhite male e(0) is white female labor
force participation. The cause responsible
may be marginal stress increase to the
nonwhite male of job competition from the
white female. The positive effect of white
male labor force participation lacks explanation. Although the positive relation to
GRR(W) is not readily understood, the
linkage to medical care is obvious. It
should be mentioned that for the study in
general, medical care appears in only 3 out
of 12 life expectancy regressions and is of
dominant importance only once. The
remaining factors are interpreted similarly
to those for white males. Markedly different factors account for e(0) and e(50) for
the nonwhite male, a negative relation
with net migration being the most significant for e(50).

For the nonwhite female, the life span is
related strongly to nonwhite in-migration.
Possibly the in-migration stream allows
greater expansion of access to female preventative health and medical care. The
opposite tendency with white in-migration
and net migration might involve employment competition or less access to health
care services. The advantages of higher
income level on nonwhite female e(0) are
obvious. Higher per cent of high-school
graduation appears to contribute its health
benefits prior to age 50. However, the percentage of 1970 high-school graduation for
persons 25+ is composed to a large extent
of persons under age 50. For all females,
results for e(50) are highly similar to those
for e(0).

Regression analysis of e(1,50) differs extremely from that of e(50). This difference
is attributed to causative factors of death
specific to the two portions of life. Unlike
older ages, from ages 1 to 50 accidents and
violence are of major importance (accounting for 37 per cent of the life table 1(x)
column for males and 20 per cent for females in the U.S. in 1964). For the white
male, the positive relationship of e(1,50) to
welfare and to nonwhite male employment
may be due in turn to less violence by
nonwhites. Higher education levels for
whites may raise e(1,50) because of job
health benefits. For the white female

— e(1,50), the inverse effect of white GRR

may only be hypothesized as stress from
greater childbearing leading to increased
cancer or heart disease. Again, higher
employment rates for the husband would
lead to more income and job-related
health care. The positive effect from nonwhite GRR is without an apparent reason.
In general, e(1,50) has much less influence
from the structural forces of migration and
density than at ages over 50. For the nonwhite male, e(1,50) is positively related to
medical care and population size, which
likely also reflects better health care. The

Fertility and Mortality

81

negative link with per cent nonwhite is
unexplained.

For GRR of whites, an inverse relation
with level of medical care is of greatest
import. The reason may be greater availability and exposure to birth control
information and wider use of contraception. The second factor in importance, e(0)
of nonwhite males, is perhaps due to
greater life expectancy in the entire male
population, as white e(0) is highly
correlated with nonwhite e(0). Longer life
expectancy reflects a healthier male population and thus a greater tendency to favor
childbearing. Density’s positive effect on
the fertility of both ethnic groups has no
ready explanation. The result is similar to
that of De Sandre (1971) for density
measured by persons per room, but opposite to the findings of Heer (1970) for density caleulated as distance from other
cities. The apparent lack of importance of
per cent Catholic contrasts with Heer’s results for 1960 counties.

Different influences account for nonwhite fertility, the most significant being a
negative relationship with per cent nonwhite. Perhaps there is a desire in small
nonwhite populations in areas with low
past migration to reproduce more in order
to retain or increase their size to a level
they consider adequate. The inverse
influence of net migration may be linked to
the above explanation, in that a larger rate
of net in-migration 1960-—70 was a factor
which generally increased the percentage
nonwhite in the period 1960-70. A higher
level of white in-migration also may be
causative in increasing nonwhite fertility.
The positive influence of density is again
unexplained.

The lesser contributors to nonwhite
GRR are nonwhite income (negative) and
white male labor participation (positive).
The first is interpreted as convergence
toward family-size norms typical of
greater income, while the second can be

explained as indirect competition leading
to less availability of jobs for nonwhite
males and a consequent increase in fertility. Higher net migration, creating a more
expansive job market for nonwhites, may
lower fertility because employment would
tend to reduce emphasis on childbearing.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Regional, ethnic, and sex variations in
period fertility, life expectancy, infant
mortality, and age structure were examined for 29 SMSA’s in the eastern half of
the United States in 1970. The SMSA’s
were chosen on the basis of low inmigration and ranged in size from 232,000
to 4,800,000. The age structures revealed
ethnic variation with a more tapered nonwhite distribution and with greater proportionate numbers of nonwhite males at
older ages. There was an increase with age
in the proportionate size of sex—age gap in
life expectancy of whites relative to nonwhites; but these differences were not
large enough to account for the larger sex
ratios for nonwhites at older ages.

Consistent geographical trends in fertility or life expectancy were not apparent.
These vital indices were explained in
terms of seventeen population and socioeconomic characteristics, including size,
density, medical care, welfare, migration,
labor force, ethnic composition, religion,
income, and education. Density was
measured by an index which excludes land

Social Biology

to which persons are not likely to relate.
Important regression results obtained are
dissimilarity between ¢(50) and e(1,50),
negative effects of density on older white
life expectancy, enhancement of total life
expectancy by income and education (except for the white female), specific effects
of migration on older hfe expectancies,
explanation of white period fertility by
medical care (negative) and density (positive) and of nonwhite period fertility by
per cent nonwhite (negative), migration,
and density (positive). Except for the
nonwhite male, there is surprisingly small
simple or multiple correlation of life expectancy to the medical care index. Infant
mortality is correlated with the
independent variables only for the nonwhite female.
