ABSTRACT: A sample survey was conducted of a nationwide voluntary association whose purpose
is to challenge societal pressures to have children and to provide support for those choosing to
remain childless. The membership was predominantly under 35 years of age and married, almost
entirely Caucasian, disproportionately concentrated in the higher education and income categories, and not committed to religion. Asked to rate the importance of various reasons for their
decision not to have children, members under 35 years of age most frequently cited the deleterious
effect of children on personal independence, the responsibility of rearing a child, and the
interference of children with the marital relationship. Two out of three members ‘under 35
intending to have no children reported pressures to have children, with the media, friends, and

coworkers (but not parents) most often named as the leading sources.

The traditional premise in American
society that children are a desirable aspect
of marriage has recently been challenged
by two studies based on national sample
surveys (Institute for Social Research,
1974). In the words of one:

The best of all possible worlds, for most
Americans, is to be newly married and not
have children. . . . Almost as soon as a
couple has kids, their happy bubble bursts.
For both men and women, reports of happiness and satisfaction drop to average, not to
rise again significantly until their children
are grown and about to leave the nest.
(Campbell, 1975, pp. 38, 39)

These studies have been supplemented by
a July 1975 national poll conducted by
The Gallup Organization (1975) for
McCall’s magazine. Parents with children
under 18 years of age were asked if they
would again have children. Ten per cent
reported that they would not and 3 per

cent were uncertain, with women giving
these responses more often than men.

There thus exists a substantial number
of Americans whose happiness has been
negatively affected by children and who
are willing to express their dissatisfaction
with parenthood. The 10 per cent in the
McCall’s survey reporting they would not
have children again represent approximately 5.5 million adults (McLaughlin,
1975). Such extensive dissatisfaction
would seem almost certain to generate a
large pool of childless individuals unwilling to become parents, despite the influences of the American ideal of parenthood
(Blake, 1974) to which these individuals
are subjected. This pool had become sufficiently large by early 1972 to permit the
establishment of the National Organization for Non-Parents (NON) to identify
and attack sources of pronatalism, to publicize the advantages of the child-free life
style, and to provide group support for
those choosing that life style. To accomplish these objectives, NON does not engage in political action, but is educational

and social in nature and has a nationwide
membership with 62 local chapters in 31
states.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In November, 1975, the authors sent a
ten-page questionnaire to a sample of
NON members obtained by systematic
sampling. Every third person on the national organization’s membership roster
who had paid dues for 1975 and who resided in the United States was selected for
the sample. (There are an unknown number of individuals who belong to local
chapters but who have not paid dues to
the national organization and do not appear on the latter’s membership roster.) A
total of 420 members received the questionnaire, and 334 completed it, a return
rate of 80 per cent. The return rate was
obtained with a single mailing of the
questionnaire, reminder postcards sent to
the entire sample a few days later and to
nonrespondents approximately three
weeks after the questionnaire, and notices
of the survey in the NON membership
newsletter before and during the datagathering period.

The 80 per cent return rate compares
well with the 73 per cent obtained by Barnett (1974) in a survey of the membership
of Zero Population Growth where a comparable procedure but substantially shorter questionnaire was used and with the 74
per cent, 75 per cent, and 82 per cent
obtained in three mailed questionnaire
surveys of Sierra Club members between
1969 and 1972 (Bartell and St. George,
1973; Devall, 1970).

Four lines of sociological research have
a bearing on the present study and help
predict the NON membership profile.
First is research on membership in voluntary associations generally. Using national
survey data, Hyman and Wright (1971)
report that the majority of Americans are
not members of a voluntary association

 

 

MacDonald Social Biology
but that the probability of membership
increases with education and is higher
among white-collar than blue-collar occupations. Second is research on the population control movement; NON has obvious
relevance to the movement and, indeed,
has described itself as “a population and
personal rights organization” (National
Organization for Non-Parents, 1975). This
line of research consists of two studies
(Barnett, 1971, 1974) on the membership
of Zero Population Growth and will be
used in the discussion below to provide a
comparison with the findings of the present study on the demographic characteristics of NON members. Third is research
on the correlates of support for women’s
rights. Welch (1975) reports that support
among women for the women’s liberation
movement increases with education, occupational status, and liberalism and declines with increasing age and religious
orthodoxy. Fourth is research on the diffusion of innovations; in view of the strong
American ideal favoring childbearing
(Blake, 1974), voluntary childlessness
would seem to be an innovative concept.
A review of research found that early acceptance of innovations is associated with
high education and income and with low
levels of dogmatism and rigidity (Rogers,
1962).

The preceding research thus leads to the
expectation that NON members will be
concentrated among those: (1) in the
higher echelons of education, income, and
occupation; (2) in the younger age groups
(which can also be expected from the fact
that the focus of the organization is on the
childbearing years); (3) possessing a liberal, nonrigid, nondogmatic, nontraditional philosophy.

RESULTS

We will begin by examining the distribution of NON members on variables
most relevant to the nature of the organi

zation. Where the data exist for a relevant
comparison, NON members will be compared with the members of Zero Population Growth (ZPG) since, as indicated
above, NON describes itself as a population organization in part. There is some
overlap in the membership of the two organizations; 29 per cent of the NON respondents in the present survey reported
that they were members of ZPG, but since
ZPG is numerically much larger, NON
members constitute only 4 per cent of the
current ZPG membership.

It should be noted that the ZPG data
were gathered approximately five years
prior to the current survey and that the
size of the ZPG membership has declined
drastically in this time. However, in the
period between his two surveys, Barnett
(1974) found no change that was statistically significant at the 0.05 level in the
distribution of the key demographic variables describing the membership. These
surveys, while conducted less than a year
apart, spanned a doubling of membership
size and suggest that the distribution of
demographic variables is relatively insensitive to substantial alterations in number
of members.

Let us first deal with the marital characteristics of NON members. Only a minority were single—16 per cent reported
themselves to be single and never married
and 6 per cent reported themselves to be
divorced. Four out of five were thus currently married—69 per cent, married and
never divorced; 6 per cent, married and
previously divorced; 1 per cent, married
and previously widowed; and 2 per cent,
separated. The married members, moreover, appeared to enjoy being married,
since 50 per cent had been married six
years or longer and only 12 per cent had
been married two years or less.

NON members are not only predominantly married, but they are also predominantly in their childbearing years. In

National Organization for Non-Parents

299

terms of age, they are similar to, though
slightly older than, the members of Zero
Population Growth (Barnett, 1974). The
mean age of the NON sample was 31 years
and the median was 29 years, with 12 per
cent under 25, 44 per cent 25-29, 24 per
cent 30-34, 10 per cent 35-39, and 11 per
cent 40 or over. However, even though
concentrated in their childbearing period,
few NON members have children or intend to have children. Only 9 per cent in
the sample as a whole, and only 3 per cent
of those under 35 years of age, have children. Of those who were childless and in
their prime childbearing years (i.e., under
35), the vast majority intend to remain
childless; 93 per cent intend to have no
children while 3 per cent intend to have
one child and 4 per cent intend to have
two.

In terms of measures of achievement,
NON members are disproportionately
well-educated compared to the general
United States population (for which information was obtained on persons 14
years of age and older from U. S. Bureau
of the Census, 1974). Only 12 per cent of
the NON membership had not gone to
college compared to 76 per cent of the
United States population as a whole. Seventy per cent of NON members had at
least a bachelor’s degree; by contrast, only
11 per cent of the American people have
four or more years of college. Thirty-three
per cent had a graduate (master’s or doctoral) degree, but only 4 per cent of the
United States population has five or more
years of college.

Unfortunately, a comparison of the
educational attainment of NON members
as a whole with that of the population as a
whole is potentially misleading. The probability of acquiring a college education is
highest in the very age categories in which
NON members are concentrated. To determine whether the educational attainment of the NON membership is indepenDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

main disproportionately in the ranks of the
well-educated.

Comparing the educational levels of
NON and ZPG members is complicated
by differences in the frequency and level of
students in the two organizations. Approximately four out of ten ZPG members were
students (Barnett, 1971), but only one out
of ten NON members was a student. All of
the students in NON were in college, 30
per cent being prebaccalaureate and 70
per cent being postbaccalaureate. However, in ZPG, one out of seven students
was in high school, and’ those in college
were twice as likely to be at the undergraduate level as at the graduate level,
exactly the reverse of the situation in
NON. Thus, the educational level of students in NON was higher than that in
ZPG. However, among nonstudents, the
distribution of education was almost identical in the two organizations.

One of the curious findings of the survey
is that while NON members surpass the

 

eral population (calculated for all persons
in the United States in 1974 from U. S.
Bureau of the Census, 1976, p. 106) is in
the 25-34 age range, since two-thirds of all
members are in this age bracket. Among
those 25-34 years old, the proportion earning $10,000-$14,999 is somewhat larger in
the membership than in the population (36
versus 23 per cent), and the proportion
earning at least $15,000 is twice as large in
the membership as in the population (26
versus 13 per cent). Even greater differences, however, are found between the
membership and the population in high
educational categories. Among those
25-34 years old, the proportion holding a
bachelor’s degree is three-and-a-half times
larger in the membership than in the population (71 versus 20 per cent), and the
proportion holding a graduate degree is
more than four times larger (35 versus 8
per cent). NON members, in short, have
achieved higher levels of income and education than the population as a whole, but

Vol. 23, No. 4

their achievement in the realm of education is greater than their achievement in
the realm of income.

A further indication of the socioeconomic status of NON members is found in
their distribution on the status scores for
589 occupations developed by Nam et al.
(1975, p. 571) which, using 1970 census
data, specify “the approximate percentage
of persons in the experienced civilian labor
force who are in occupations having combined average levels of education and income below that for the given occupation.” Excluding those who were students
or unemployed, an open-ended question
on occupation showed that almost half (47
per cent) of the members were in the top
20 per cent and that almost one-fourth (23
per cent) were in the top 10 per cent.

The relatively high achievement level of
NON members can be partially attributed
to the fact that they generally were reared
in small families or were born before any
siblings. Both of these factors have been
found linked to high achievement in education, income, and occupation (Orshansky and Bretz, 1976; Terhune, 1974;
Wray, 1971). Fifteen per cent were only
children, 32 per cent had just one sibling,
and 53 per cent had two or more siblings.
In the population as a whole, children
born to women who were 50-59 years old
in 1975 (and who were 20-29 years old

National Organization for Non-Parents

301

when the average NON member was
born) were likely to come from larger families: 6 per cent were only children and 19
per cent had just one sibling (calculated
from U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1973).
In terms of birth order, 38 per cent of all
members were the first children their parents had. Thus, slightly over half were
either only children or the first-born (15
per cent + 38 per cent = 53 per cent).

One of the most distinctive features of
NON members uncovered in the present
study is found in their religious affiliations
and particularly in the changes that have
occurred between the religions in which
they were raised and those with which
they now identify. Table 2 provides the
distribution of the respondents’ original
and current religious orientations and the
distribution for the United States population as a whole. The latter is from a 1957
census bureau survey assessing religious
identification; being two decades old, it
suggests the original religions of today’s
population, but it has also been employed
as “the most reliable” estimate of the current religious distribution of the population (Steinberg, 1973, p. 102).

In terms of the religions in which NON
members were raised, Table 2 indicates
that Protestants and Catholics are slightly
underrepresented in the membership and
that Jews, agnostics, and other religious

orientations are overrepresented. This distribution is remarkably similar to that
found in Zero Population Growth (Barnett, 1974). In terms of current religious
identification among NON members, the
religious groups continue their pattern of
overrepresentation or underrepresentation, but except for Jews, the magnitude of
the over- or underrepresentation is markedly enhanced as the result of substantial
shifts in affiliation.

United States population as a whole. A
1955 Gallup poll found that only 4 per cent
of all Americans reported a change in religious affiliation (Gallup, 1972). Moreover, of those NON members who
changed, four out of five shifted to no
formal religion—57 per cent became agnostics and 22 per cent became atheists.

NON members, then, do not have a
strong commitment to religion. This fact is
further shown in their frequency of attendance at religious services, with seven out

in each religion changed. (Because of the
small numbers raised as atheists and in
other religions, the changes of these individuals are not shown.) The most stable
group was of agnostics, with two-thirds
not changing. Jews were the second most
stable group, with approximately threefifths not changing. Protestants were less
stable, with two-fifths still identifying
themselves as such. Catholics were the
least stable, only 29 per cent remaining
with the Church.

Perhaps the major distinction lies between Jews and agnostics, on the one
hand, and Protestants and Catholics, on
the other; the majority of the former did
not change while the majority of the latter
did. However, because the latter two
groups were numerically larger, a majority of the entire membership (57 per
cent) had changed from the religious orientation in which they were raised. This rate
of change seems far larger than in the

of ten reporting that they “almost never”
attend. Only 10 per cent said they attend
“about once a week.” By comparison, 40
per cent of the American population attends church weekly (The Gallup Organization, n.d.). |

Several additional membership characteristics are of interest and may be summarized briefly:

1. There are slightly more females than
males in NON. Forty-four per cent of the
respondents were male, and 56 per cent were
female.

2. The membership is almost exclusively
Caucasian. Only 1 per cent of the respondents were nonwhite. The same was true of
Zero Population Growth (Barnett, 1974).
3. About three-fourths of the members have
belonged to the organization at least one
year, and four out of ten reported being
members 24 months or more, indicating
more than a fleeting commitment. The median length of membership was 17.5 months.
4, Inresponse to the question, “Which of the
following best describes your political orientation?”, 18 per cent of the respondents selected the alternative “strongly liberal”; 46

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

Vol. 23, No. 4

per cent, “moderately liberal”; 18 per cent,
“middle of the road”; 16 per cent, “moderately conservative”; and 2 per cent, “strongly
conservative.”

In the remainder of the analysis, we will
focus on member characteristics associated with the decision not to have children. The discussion will be confined to
members (1) who are and intend to remain
childless and (2) who are under 35 years of
age and thus in their prime childbearing
years. A number of demographic factors
examined previously will be evaluated for
their effects, if any, on these characteristics. However, tests of significance will
not be used. Not only do serious questions
exist concerning their applicability and
utility in social research (Morrison and
Henkel, 1970), but the respondents in the
survey constitute a large proportion (specifically, 26 per cent) of the total membership, rendering such tests less useful than
where a small sampling fraction exists for
the purpose of generalizing to the membership as a whole. Thus, reliance will be
placed solely on measures of relationship
strength. Goodman’s and Kruskal’s gamma will be used where two ordinallevel variables are involved, and Cramér’s
V, which is identical to the phi coefficient
in the case of 2 X & tables, will be used
where one of the variables is nominal.
Gamma and, in the case of 2 X 2 tables,
V? specify the proportion by which errors
in predicting the dependent variable will
be reduced over random guessing by
knowing how individuals score on the independent variable (Blalock, 1972; Champion, 1970).

The data to follow are largely concerned
with attitudinal characteristics, and the
reader is cautioned not to infer that these
characteristics motivated the members to
join NON or existed prior to joining.
There is evidence that the attitudes of social movement participants are to a significant extent acquired after joing an

303

organization and through socialization in
the organization (Morrison, 1967) and that
the attitudes of the members of an organization can shift substantially in the course
of a year (Bartell, 1974), which is less time
than most members had belonged to
NON.

Respondents under 35 who are and intend to remain childless were asked at
what age they decided not to have children, and a mean of 5.1 years and a median of 4.1 years were found to have
elapsed since the decision was made. The
ages at which the decision was made
ranged from 10 through 32 years, with a
mean of 22.5. One fifth reached the decision prior to turning 20, an additional fifth
reached the decision at age 20 or 21, and
another fifth made the decision at age 22,
23, or 24. Sex made a difference here, with
females more likely than males to decide in
the early ages (see Table 4). Education,
too, had an effect, with the higher educational levels making the decision later.

What reasons do these NON members
give for their decision to be child-free?
Respondents were asked, “How important
to you personally is each of the following
as a reason for not having children?” Fifteen statements were given, and respondents were provided with four alternatives, namely, “very important,” “of some
importance,” “of no importance,” and
“uncertain.” Table 5 presents the statements and the distribution of responses to
each among NON members under 35 who
are and intend to remain childless. (Those
responding “uncertain” or giving no response are deleted from the distributions
in Table 5, since they numbered 10 per
cent or more on only three statements,
namely, Nos. 10, 13, and 14, with the
highest incidence being 14 per cent in the
case of statement No. 13.)

little doubt about the relative importance
of these statements, since the statements
constituted four of the five which were

the lowest percentage), indicating that
personal independence is a vital consideration in the decision not to be a parent. In

come, marital status, occupational status
(measured by the scale developed by Nam
et al., 1975), religion in which the respondents were raised, sex, and number of
years married—we found only one to have
a clear effect. This was number of years
married (gamma = 0.48), with the incidence of “very important” declining from
those married four years or less (94 per
cent) to those married ten years or more
(73 per cent).

“Adequately caring for and rearing a
child is a heavy responsibility” was rated
“very important” by the second-highest
proportion (and “of no importance” by the
second-lowest proportion). Examining the
eight demographic variables, sex (V =
0.27 ina2 X 3 table) and income (gamma
= 0.14) were found to have an influence
on responses to the statement. The rating
of “very important” was more frequent
among females (80 per cent) than males (54
per cent) and declined across five income
categories from under $5,000 (75 per cent)
to $20,000 and over (59 per cent).

“Having children intrudes on the relationship with your spouse” was considered
“very important” by the third-highest
proportion (and “of no importance” by the
third-lowest proportion). Sex (V = 0.21 in
a2 X 3 table), age (gamma = 0.21), marital status (V = 0.29 in a 2 X 3 table),
religion in which the respondent was
raised (V = 0.14 in a 3 X 3 table), and
number of years married (gamma = 0.15)
affected responses to the statement. The
proportion considering the statement
“very important” was higher among females than males (71 versus 56 per cent);
declined with age from under 25 years (79
per cent) to 30-34 years (60 per cent); was
higher among those married and never divorced (68 per cent) than among those
single and never married (50 per cent); was
higher among those raised as Protestants
and Catholics (67 and 68 per cent, respectively) than among those raised as Jews (42

305

per cent); and increased with number of
years married from under 5 years (65 per
cent) to 10 or more years (82 per cent).

“My spouse does not want children”
was deemed “very important” by the
fourth-highest proportion. Sex affected responses (V = 0.18 in a2 X 3 table), with
males considering the statement “very important” more often than females (66 versus 53 per cent).

The last statement rated “very important” by at least half of the respondents
under 35 intending to remain childless was
“rearing a child is financially expensive.”
Education (gamma = 0.22) and religion in
which the respondent was raised (V = 0.11
in a3 X 3 table) were related to responses
to the statement. The incidence of “very
important” ratings was higher among
those with no college (62 per cent) and
some college (68 per cent) than among
those who had a bachelor’s degree (43 per
cent) or a graduate degree (44 per cent),
and it was higher among those reared as
Protestants (57 per cent) than among those
reared as Catholics (47 per cent) and lowest among those reared as Jews (40 per
cent).

Before turning to other aspects of the
survey, let us look briefly at the other arguments where there were interesting effects by the demographic variables. “I
simply do not like children” was related to
education (gamma = 0.26), those with a
graduate degree (12 per cent) being much
less likely to rate it “very important” than
those with no more than a bachelor’s degree (30-35 per cent for bachelor’s degree,
some college, and no college).

“Rearing a child would interfere with
my career” was related to sex (VV = 0.34 in
a2 xX 3 table) and to number of years
married (gamma = 0.16). Females were
more likely than males to rate the statement “very important” (52 versus 25 per
cent), and those married ten or more years
were less likely than those married five to

nine years or under five years (20, 45, and
44 per cent, respectively) to rate it “very
important.”

“Other parents don’t seem to get that
much satisfaction from having children”
was related to sex (V = 0.12 ina 2 X 3
table), education (gamma = 0.16), and religion in which the respondent was raised
(V = 0.18 ina 3 X 3 table). Females were
more likely than males to rate the argument “very important” (33 versus 22 per
cent). The incidence of “very important”
declined as educational attainment increased (from 44 per cent among those
with no college to 20 per cent among those
with a graduate degree). Those reared as
Jews (5 per cent) were less likely to consider the statement “very important” than
those raised as Catholics (30 per cent) or
Protestants (35 per cent).

“Children reduce the happiness of marriage” was related to sex (V = 0.10ina2 X
3 table) and religion in which the respondent was raised (V = 0.22 ina3 X 3 table).
Females considered the statement “very
important” more often than males (48 versus 38 per cent), and those reared as Jews
(7 per cent) considered it “very important”
less often than Catholics (44 per cent) or
Protestants (50 per cent).

“T don’t think I’d be a good parent” was
related to age (gamma = 0.19) and to educational level (gamma = 0.37). The incidence of the “very important” rating declined with age, receiving the approval of
55 per cent of those under age 25, 45 per
cent of those ages 25-29, and 33 per cent
of those ages 30-34. It also declined with
education, receiving the approval of 58
per cent of those with no college, 56 per
cent of those with some college, 43 per
cent of those with a bachelor’s degree, and
21 per cent of those with a graduate degree.

Respondents who were planning to remain childless were asked about their parrents’ knowledge of and attitude toward

their decision not to have children. The
question was followed by the alternatives
appearing in Table 6, which presents the
distribution of responses by those under 35
years of age who intend to have no children. Altogether, 72 per cent of the respondents reported that their mother
knew of the decision, and 65 per cent reported that their father knew. Mothers
were almost twice as likely as fathers to
know and to approve of the decision or to
know and to have mixed feelings about it.
On the other hand, fathers were over three
times as likely as mothers to know of the
decision but not to have indicated how
they felt about it. There were some differences by sex, with V = 0.24 ina 2 X 9
table for the mother and with V = 0.28 in
a2 9 table for the father. With regard to
mothers, females more than males reported that she knew and approved of the
decision (25 versus 12 per cent), and males
more than females reported that she knew
of the decision but had not indicated how

With regard to fathers, females more than
males stated that he knew and approved
of the decision (14 versus 6 per cent), and
males more than females stated that he
knew of but had mixed feelings about the
decision (31 versus 11 per cent).

We next turn to the  pronatalist
pressures experienced by NON members,
continuing to confine our analysis to those
under 35 years of age who intend to remain childless. Sixty-three per cent stated
that they felt pressures to have children,
with the proportion being slightly higher,
among females than males (68 versus 59
per cent). Respondents reporting pressure
were asked to rank the three leading
sources in the order of their importance
from a list of fourteen alternatives: mother, father, both mother and _ father,
mother-in-law, father-in-law, mother-inlaw and father-in-law equally, brothers
and/or sisters, brothers-in-law and/or
sisters-in-law, other relatives, spouse,
friends, coworkers, media, other.

Perhaps most notable was the lack of
agreement on the rankings, with no single
alternative being the choice of more than
one-fourth of the respondents. In ranking
the most important source of pressure, 16
per cent designated the media, 14 per cent
designated friends, and 13 per cent each
designated their mothers and coworkers,
with the other alternatives each being designated by less than 10 per cent. In ranking the second most important source of
pressure, 23 per cent each selected friends
and the media, 15 per cent selected coworkers, and 10 per cent each selected
their mothers-in-law and other relatives.
The remaining alternatives were each selected by Jess than 5 per cent. In ranking
the third most important source of
pressure, 25 per cent chose the media, 20
per cent chose friends, 14 per cent chose
other relatives, and 13 per cent chose co
chosen by no more than 6 per cent.

It should be noted that the spouse was
selected by fewer than 5 per cent as the
first, second, or third source of pressure.
This is consistent with the answers of currently married nonseparated respondents
under 35 intending-to have no children to
a question on the degree of spousal agreement with their decision to remain childless. Eighty-seven per cent indicated that
the spouse “strongly agrees” with the decision, and an additional 7 per cent reported that their spouse “moderately”
agreed; only 4 per cent stated their spouse
disagreed with the decision.

The data show that no single source of
pronatalist pressure predominates, but
they also show that three sources—media,
friends, and coworkers—are consistently
selected by a substantial proportion of the
respondents. The three together were chosen as the most important sourceby 43 per
cent, as the second most important source
by 61 per cent, and as the third most important source by 58 per cent. Furthermore, the responses suggested the media
were slightly more important than friends
and that friends were slightly more important than coworkers.

In what pronatalist arguments are the
pressures manifested? Respondents were
asked, “How often do you personally encounter the following arguments urging
you to have children?” Eleven statements
were presented together with the alternatives “very often,” “sometimes,” and
“never.” The statements and the distribution of responses to each appear in
Table 7.

“Tt is selfish not to have children” was
the argument most frequently encountered
“very often” and the only argument encountered “very often” by more than half
of the respondents. Educational level

X 3 table) had an effect on responses. The
proportion reporting that they encountered the argument “very often” was lower
among those with a graduate degree (41
per cent) than among those with a
bachelor’s degree or less (where percentages ranged between 56 and 58). Members
raised as Catholics reported encountering
the argument “very often” more than those
raised as Jews or Protestants (70, 55, and

responses to this argument. Females were
more likely than males to report encountering the argument “very often” (53 versus 37 per cent). The proportion of respondents reporting the argument “very

among those under 25 to 42 per cent

raised as Protestants or Jews (57, 41, and
40 per cent, respectively).

“You are intelligent and responsible
and can raise the kind of person your
country needs” was experienced “very often” by the third-largest proportion of respondents. Educational level (gamma =
0.32) had a bearing on responses, with the
proportion reporting the argument “very
often” increasing with education (from 19
per cent among those with no college to 44
per cent among those with a graduate degree).

“Vou'll never be a complete man or
woman until you become a parent” was
the last argument encountered “very often” by more than one out of four respondents. Sex affected responses (V = 0.21 in
a 2 X 3 table), females being twice as
likely as males to report the argument
“very often” (37 versus 19 per cent).

One of the most notable aspects of the
data in Table 7 is that only one argument
was reported “very often” by half or more
of the respondents and only three by onethird or more. Formal pronatalist arguments thus do not appear to be an important feature of the pressures to have children experienced by two out of three NON

members, suggesting either that the
pressures are manifested in more subtle
nonverbal forms or that the intensity of
the pressure is not great. Unfortunately,
the questionnaire used in the survey did
not include items with which to assess
these possibilities.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Members of the National Organization
for Non-Parents possess a number of distinctive characteristics which should be
emphasized. Members are generally young
and married; only one in five was 35 years
of age or older, and only one in five was
single. The membership was almost entirely Caucasian, and its education and
income (though education to a greater extent than income) exceeded that of the
United States population as a whole.
Members did not have a strong commitment to traditional, formal religion; three
out of five had changed from the religion
in which they were raised, and the vast
majority of these individuals became
atheists or agnostics. Members’ achievements in education and income and their
lack of commitment to religion suggest
that their values differ markedly from
those of the general population, a question
studied elsewhere (Barnett and MacDonald, unpublished).

Members in their prime childbearing
years (i.e., under 35) who were and intended to remain childless were examined
on a number of characteristics relevant to
their decision not to have children. The
decision had been made a median of 4.1
years earlier. The most important reasons
for the decision were reported to be the
effect of children on personal indepen

dence, the responsibility involved in rearing a child, the perceived interference of
children with the marital relationship, opposition by the spouse to having children,
and the financial expense of childrearing.
The parents of the majority knew of the
decision, but only a small minority of the
parents approved of it, with females receiving the approval of their parents more
often than males. Approximately two out
of three reported experiencing pressures to
have children, with the media, friends,
and coworkers (but not parents) most
often named as the leading sources. However, only two pronatalist arguments were
encountered often by a majority or close to
a majority: “It is selfish not to have children” and “you will be unhappy when you
get older, especially after you retire, if you
do not have children.”

By way of conclusion, it is probably
correct to state that the National Organization for Non-Parents represents the first
organized attempt in history to challenge
openly the strong pronatalist pressures in
society. Sociological and psychological research on childlessness is scarce (Fawcett,
1970), in part because of the success of
pronatalist pressures in suppressing voluntary childlessness (Veevers, 1974), and to
the extent NON succeeds in increasing the
incidence of the child-free life style, such
research can be expected to become more
common. However, members of social
movement organizations such as NON
undoubtedly differ from nonmembers having the same general goals (Hornback,
1974, Chap. 2), and thus the present study
should add as much to research on social
movements as to research on voluntary
childlessness.
