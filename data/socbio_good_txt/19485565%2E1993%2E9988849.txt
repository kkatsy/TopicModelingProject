ABSTRACT: Both breastfeeding initiation and duration increased in Peru during 1977-86. .Although one would have expected that the average incidence and duration of breastfeeding would
have declined as a result of changes in population characteristics, the potential for an overall
decline was more than overcome by changes in behavior. A net increase in initiation and duration
is shown for all subgroups of interest. The largest absolute increases are documented for children
who, in 1977, were the least likely to be breastfed and who were breastfed for the shortest

durations.

In developing countries, breastfeeding is one of the most important determinants of infant health during the
first year of life (Habicht et al., 1986;
Holland, 1987; Knodel and Kintner,
1977; Millman and Cooksey, 1987;
Palloni and Millman, 1986; Palloni
and Tienda, 1986; Pebley and Stupp,
1987). Besides being a clean source
of important nutrients, breast milk
provides the infant immunological
protection against disease. Prolonged
breastfeeding further contributes to a
child’s wellbeing through stimulating
the emotional ties between the mother
and the child and through causing
longer birth intervals (for a review, see
VanLandingham et al., 1991).

Reports of an apparent decline in
breastfeeding initiation and duration in
many developing countries during the
1970’s and early 1980’s have focused
renewed attention on the determinants
of breastfeeding behavior (Chayovan
et al., 1990; Stewart et al., 1991; Trussell et al., 1992; Zohoori et al., 1991)
and have led to the adoption of breast
feeding promotion as one of WHO’s
and UNICEF’s top policy priorities
(Grant, 1988). Concern over diarrheal
disease, one of the leading causes of
child morbidity and mortality in most
Third World societies, has also focused
more general attention on weaning
practices (Ashworth and Feachem,
1985; Chayovan et al., 1990; Feachem
and Koblinski, 1984).

Most analyses of differentials in
breastfeeding duration have examined
breastfeeding behavior only at one
point in time rather than over time.
Designing successful policy interventions requires a better understanding
of trends and changes in differentials
over time. For example, much of the
reported decline in breastfeeding duration may be due primarily to changes
in population characteristics over time
rather than to behavioral changes
within subgroups of women. The results from a recent study (Guilkey et
al., 1990) that examined changes in the
determinants of breastfeeding behavior in the Philippines between 1973 and

1983 are instructive in this regard. Although breastfeeding initiation had declined in the Philippines over this tenyear period, the decline was explained
almost entirely by shifts in population
characteristics over time (the different
characteristics of women in the two
samples) rather than by behavioral
changes within population subgroups.
Women in all residence and education
“subcategories had increased their duiration of breastfeeding. Similar results,
based on data from both the World
EFertility Surveys (WFS) and the De® mographic and Health Surveys (DHS),
shave been reported by Grummer<— Strawn (1991a) for fifteen developing
=-countries. The author found that
"changes in the distribution of women

© Peru than in most other Latin American countries, and between the mid1970’s and mid-1980’s, breastfeeding
duration in Peru increased more substantially (by two to three months, depending on the measure used) than in
other developing countries (Trussell et
al., 1992). Furthermore, as one of
Latin America’s poorest countries,
Peru has one of the highest child mortality rates in the region—112 per

ley, 1989). Information on changes in
breastfeeding behavior over time can
thus provide valuable insights to health
policy makers responsible for the design of breastfeeding promotion campaigns and child health interventions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Our analyses use data from two nationally representative retrospective
surveys: the 1977-78 WFS and the
1986 DHS. Details of the sampling
and data collection procedures for the
two surveys can be found elsewhere
(Instituto Nacional de Planificacién,
1979; Instituto Nacional de Estadistica, 1988).! These surveys collected
comparable data on socioeconomic
status, mother’s background, and demographic characteristics. They also
obtained similar information on
breastfeeding initiation and duration.
“Breastfeeding” refers to any breastfeeding, whether or not children are
given supplemental foods. Both surveys asked questions on whether a
child was ever breastfed and, if so, for
how long. These questions, however,
were asked for a different subgroup of
births in the two surveys: in the WFS,
for the last and next-to-last births only
(Ferry and Smith, 1983),? in the DHS,

IWhile both surveys used a multi-stage cluster
sampling technique, our analysis implicitly assumes
that a simple random sample was employed. As a
result, the standard errors we report are slightly underestimated. We do not expect that accounting for
the complex sampling procedures would substantially affect our conclusions.

2If the woman was currently pregnant, breastfeeding information on the next-to-last child was
not included in the file, because of the decision to
code breastfeeding information in terms of open and
last closed birth intervals. For currently pregnant
women, the last closed interval was defined as the
interval between the last birth and the current preg

for all children born within five years of
the survey date. Under the assumption
that women do not breastfeed a child
after the birth of a subsequent child,
one can determine in both surveys
whether or not each child was still being breastfed at the time of the interview.?

The differences in data collection
had important implications for our
choice of methodology. An analysis of
trends over time requires using a
comparable sample of children and
eliminating problems that might arise
from the way information was obtained for the dependent variable of
interest. For these analyses, we considered two alternative approaches. To
study duration and its determinants,
we could have employed retrospectively reported ages at weaning with
techniques of survival analysis. We decided against this for two reasons.
First, retrospective reports commonly
display heaping at durations of 6, 12,
and 18 months (Lesthaeghe and Page,
1980; Trussell et al., in press). Although such heaping could represent

nancy. These women did not have an open interval
(Trussell et al., 1992).

3In the DHS, women were asked explicitly
whether or not they were currently breastfeeding
their most recently born child. In the WFS, if
women reported that they had ever breastfed a
child, they were then asked for how many months
the child had been breastfed. “Still breastfeeding”
was an acceptable coded response. In the WFS,
women thus could have reported an intended duration of breastfeeding for currently breastfed children. For this reason, when the reported duration of
breastfeeding exceeded the current age of the child
in the WFS, these cases were coded as still breastfeeding. This coding approach was previously
adopted by Knodel and Debavalya (1980) and Trussell et al. (in press). Also, in the WFS standard recode data file, all women who were currently pregnant were coded as not currently breastfeeding. To
produce comparable estimates from both surveys,
we coded all currently pregnant women in the DHS
as not currently breastfeeding.

real preferences for weaning times,
previous research has demonstrated
that the age heaping that is common in
retrospective reports primarily reflects
misreporting of weaning times (Grummer-Strawn, 1991a). Haaga (1988) has
further shown that the tendency to report that a child was weaned at popular
durations differs by subgroups; such
variations in reporting could have affected our estimates of differentials
and trends over time.

Second, an unbiased analysis of
breastfeeding duration requires a sample of all births from a given reference
period. Otherwise, estimated durations would be biased upward because
of the exclusion of births from women
with short birth intervals (John et al.,
1988). Because the WFS collected information only for the last two births,
we would have been forced to narrow
the reference period to roughly two
years to have data for all births in the
WFS. Such a restriction, however,
would have led to an underestimate of
the mean duration of breastfeeding
since all infants would not have been
weaned within this time period.

An alternative approach that overcomes both of these problems is to
use current-status data, which indicate
whether a child was currently being
breastfed at the time of the survey.
John et al. (1988) have shown that
current-status measures produce unbiased estimates of mean survival time.

“Trussell et al. (1992) have demonstrated that,
on average, durations of breastfeeding based on
data for current status are shorter than those based
on retrospective data from the WFS, whereas this
relationship is reversed in the DHS. This discrepancy is likely caused by misreporting of ages at
weaning in retrospective data. Current-status data
are considered more reliable because respondents
can more easily report their current behavior than
recall the date of some previous event.

For the analysis of breastfeeding duration, we restricted our sample to singleton, live births born to ever-married
women? within five years preceding the
survey. Sample sizes were 6,657 for
the WFS and 2,943 for the DHS. Because the length of breastfeeding can
be truncated by the death of the child,
the influence of mortality on trends
and differentials in breastfeeding behavior had to be separated from the
effects of socioeconomic and demographic factors. Therefore, we first examined trends in breastfeeding behavior among all and surviving children
between the two surveys to determine
the contribution of any decline in mortality to the observed change in mean
duration. All subsequent analyses of
the relative effects of population and
behavioral change over time were
based on surviving children only.

By including all surviving children in
calculations of breastfeeding duration,
the duration measure we report implicitly combined information on whether
or not children were ever breastfed,
and among those that were, the age at
weaning. To analyze the duration of
breastfeeding among only those who
were ever breastfed would have required truncating the reference period
to roughly two years, since information
on whether the child was ever breastfed could be obtained only from the
retrospective data.

In addition to examining changes in
breastfeeding duration, we also conducted a separate analysis of trends in
breastfeeding initiation among surviv

Peru the WFS collected data only for such women.

ing last-born children only.® For these
analyses, our sample sizes consisted of
3,560 surviving singleton live births
from the WFS and 1,816 from the
DHS. In summary, we analyzed two
measures of breastfeeding behavior:
(1) mean duration among all surviving
children, and (2) proportion ever
breastfed among surviving last-born
children only.

METHODS

The estimation of the mean duration of breastfeeding from currentstatus data was calculated by summing
the proportions currently breastfeeding each month:

59
CS-Mean='4S(0) + Ys@ (1)
1=1

where we define the survivorship
curve S(i) = StllBF(i)/N(@), where
StllBF(i) represents the number of
children aged i still being breastfed,
N(i) represents the total number of
births 7 months ago, and survivorship is
understood in this context to be the
proportion still breastfed (GrummerStrawn and Trussell, in press).

The use of current-status data in a
multiple regression format, on the
other hand, is more problematic and
has been considered by several authors
(Diamond et al., 1986; McDonald,
1981; Vanderhoeft, 1982; Page et al.,
1982; Trussell and Rodriguez, 1990).
In related research, we have compared
several proposed techniques and found
one method to be particularly flexible

*By restricting the analyses of initiation to lastborn children only, we slightly overestimated the
proportion ever breastfed. Based on data from the
DHS, the proportion ever breastfed among all surviving children born in the five years before the sur
vey was 95.3 per cent. Among surviving last births,
the proportion was 95.8 per cent.

and parsimonious in the analysis of
current-status data (Grummer-Strawn,
1991b). This method involves the use
of logistic regression in which the baseline log-odds of currently breastfeeding each month are modeled with a natural cubic spline. A cubic spline is a
series of third-degree polynomials defined separately for specified age intervals. The age segments are joined together at specified points called knots,
and constraints on the polynomials ensure that they join together smoothly
(for a discussion of splines in regression analysis, see Smith, 1979; Wegman and Wright, 1983). Fairly few
knots can produce a smooth yet flexible survivorship curve that falls monotonically with increasing duration. In
our analysis, we fitted natural cubic
splines by using four age intervals:
0-12, 12-24, 24-36, and 36-60 months
(for a definition of natural cubic
splines, see McNeil et al., 1977). Estimating the multivariate model involves
including four variables needed to define the spline function along with chosen determinants of breastfeeding behavior:

Social Biology

The dependent variable is coded
“1” if the child was currently breastfed, and “‘0” otherwise. Coefficients on
the explanatory variables (the Bs) have
the standard interpretation as in any
logistic regression model: positive coefficients raise the log-odds of still breastfeeding at any duration. Thus, positive
coefficients indicate a longer mean duration of breastfeeding. Logistic regression techniques are also used in the
analyses of breastfeeding initiation,
where the dependent variable is coded
“1” if the child was ever breastfed and
0 otherwise; positive coefficients in this
case indicate a higher probability that
the child was ever breastfed.

VARIABLE SELECTION

Several previous studies have discussed models of breastfeeding behavior and various individual, household,
and community-level factors associated with breastfeeding initiation and
duration (Akin et al., 1981; Laukaran
et al., 1981; Popkin et al., 1983). We
based our choice of explanatory variables (Table 1) on both theoretical considerations and the availability of comparable data from both surveys. To
capture residential and regional variations in breastfeeding behavior, we included two factors that distinguished
between urban and rural residence and
regions of the country. The coastal and
the selva (jungle) regions were combined into one category because we
found that these two regions had no
significant differences in breastfeeding
behavior. Both factors measured influences of modernization, access to
breastmilk substitutes, and modern
health care providers. Besides current
residence, we included the woman’s
childhood place of residence. This vari

able reflected values acquired during
childhood that were not necessarily
captured by the woman’s current residence.

To account for the influence of the
family’s economic well-being, we relied on commonly used proxy measures
(husband’s education and occupation)
available in both the WFS and the
DHS. Although mother’s education
and her work status are also proxy

measures for the household’s economic status, results from previous research suggest that both have an independent influence on breastfeeding
behavior. Mother’s employment status
at the time of the two surveys incorporated both current work status and
occupation.? We examined a number

of specifications of this variable but
found no differences in the effects of
agricultural, manual, and service occupations (not shown).

Our demographic variables included sex of the child, maternal age,
and family composition. The family
composition variable combined information on parity and the number of
siblings less than five years old in the
household. Young siblings may compete with the infant for the mother’s
time as well as for resources (e.g.,
food) but may also increase the value
of time the mother spends at home. We
experimented with a number of specifications of this variable but found no
significant differences among births of
orders two and above when the presence of young siblings was incorporated into the covariate; thus, birth order was merely dichotomized (first
versus higher order births). We also incorporated a variable denoting the
presence of older siblings (aged 7-15),
who may contribute to family resources by working or providing child
care. Maternal age was included to
capture cohort effects. Finally, we included a variable on prior use of contraception; such practice would indicate contact with modern health care
providers and, generally, would indicate less traditional attitudes toward

was asked if she was currently working or had ever
worked. In the DHS, a more restrictive question
was asked first: “In the past 7 days, have you
worked?” Further questions, however, refined the
definition of work by asking the woman whether she
had worked (but was on vacation, sick leave, etc.),
whether she received “cachuelo,’’ and whether she
worked in a family business or farm. We relied on all
of these questions to define work in the DHS, since
we believed that such a definition was closest to that
specified in the WFS. Occupation was available
from both surveys for currently working women.

childrearing. Preliminary analyses indicated that ever-use of modern methods was a more powerful predictor of
breastfeeding behavior than current
use, perhaps because the effects of current use were confounded by such factors as pregnancy, infecundity, or current desire for pregnancy.®

RESULTS
TRENDS IN BREASTFEEDING BEHAVIOR

Both breastfeeding initiation and
mean duration increased in Peru between 1977 and 1986. At the time of
the WFS, roughly 90 per cent of all
children were ever breastfed; this proportion had increased to about 95 per
cent by the time of the DHS, a decade
later (Table 2). The mean duration of
breastfeeding increased by 3.0 months
(from 13.2 to 16.2 months) —a 22.7 per
cent increase. The trends in both initiation and duration were statistically
significant at a 95 per cent level. Since
the death of a child could truncate the
duration of breastfeeding, breastfeeding was observed to be about a month
longer among children who survived to
the time of the survey than among all
children. Mortality among children
under five declined between the two
surveys (Hill and Pebley, 1989). Not
surprisingly, the observed increase in
duration was somewhat smaller among
surviving children (2.8 months). Thus,
a small portion of the increase in mean

8It could be argued that mother’s work and contraceptive use were endogenous to the model and
thus caused a bias in the estimated coefficients and
standard errors. To test this, we examined results
from models with and without these covariates.
There were no important differences in the significance levels or sizes of the coefficients for any of the
other explanatory variables from those presented
here.

duration (0.2 months) appeared to be
due to a decline in mortality (Table 2).

Because our measure of mean
duration combined information on
whether or not the child was ever
breastfed, and among those that were,
the age at weaning, a small proportion
of the observed rise in mean duration
could also be attributed to the increase
in the proportion of children ever
breastfed. If the increase in breastfeeding initiation were taken into account,
the increase in mean age at weaning
among surviving children who were
ever breastfed would be about 2.2
months (WFS: 14.3/.917 = 15.6; DHS:
17.1/.958 = 17.8; calculated from Table 2) instead of 2.8 months. Thus,
both breastfeeding initiation and duration clearly increased in Peru from the
mid-1970’s to the mid-1980’s.

Table 3 provides mean durations of
breastfeeding and proportions ever
breastfed among surviving children by
the explanatory variables of interest
for both the WFS and the DHS. Both
the incidence and mean duration of
breastfeeding were highest in rural
areas and in the sierra (the Andean
mountain region) and tended to be

inversely related to socioeconomic
status. Children whose mothers had
ever used modern contraception (especially the pill) were considerably less
likely to be breastfed—and for shorter durations—than children whose
mothers had ever used modern contraception. For all categories of our explanatory variables, breastfeeding initiation and mean duration increased
between the WFS and the DHS. Although increases in breastfeeding initiation could have confounded the estimates of mean duration, we should
note that in only one subcategory of
our explanatory variables (no siblings
<5 years old in the household) could
increases in breastfeeding initiation
account for the observed rise in mean
duration. In most remaining subgroups, only a relatively smail proportion (less than 25 per cent) of the
increase in breastfeeding duration reported in Table 3 could be attributed to
the rise in breastfeeding initiation. The
absolute changes in both initiation and
mean duration were most pronounced
among children of women who were
least likely to initiate breastfeeding
or who breastfed for relatively short

durations during the 1970’s. As a result, socioeconomic differentials appeared to have narrowed between the
two surveys. These results suggest that
some important changes in the determinants of breastfeeding behavior may
have taken place during the decade under analysis.

To remove the confounding effects
of correlations among the predictors of
breastfeeding, we analyzed breastfeeding differentials in a multiple regression framework (Table 4). To simplify
discussion, we present results from a
pooled dataset from the WFS and the
DHS. These analyses used a dummy
variable coded ‘0’ for the WFS and
“1” for the DHS.° This approach allowedustotestforchangesinthedeterminants of breastfeeding behavior over

with the other covariates. A statistically significant interaction indicated a
change in the effect of the variable (or
behavior) between the two surveys.
In general, a similar set of population characteristics was associated with
both breastfeeding initiation and duration. For example, children of rural
women and women living in the sierra
were more likely to be breastfed and
were breastfed for longer durations
than children of mothers living in Lima
or other regions of the country. These
results likely reflected more traditional
attitudes on childrearing among rural
and sierran women. The results may
also have indicated lack of access to
breast milk substitutes and distance
from modern health care professionals. Consistent with previous studies of
breastfeeding behavior, we found that
children whose mothers were educated, grew up in cities, and were pill
users were less likely to be breastfed
and were breastfed for shorter durations than children of women in the

reference category. Higher socioeconomic status was also negatively associated with breastfeeding initiation and
mean duration. The effects of husband’s occupation were significant,
however, only for manual and service
occupations compared to agriculture.
Husband’s education was associated
negatively only with mean duration.
Two of the most striking differences
between the determinants of breast
 

feeding initiation and duration were related to mother’s employment status
and her age. First, women who worked
in professional occupations breastfed for shorter durations than other
women but were not less likely to initiate breastfeeding. Second, women
who were older were less likely to
initiate breastfeeding than younger
women, but we found no significant association between maternal age and

breastfeeding duration. These results
suggest a positive association between
maternal age and duration among children who were ever breastfed. Competition among young siblings for
mother’s time did not result in shorter
breastfeeding duration or lower levels
of its initiation. Rather, the presence
of young children was positively associated with both initiation and mean
duration. The presence of older siblings also had a positive effect on
breastfeeding duration, but was not associated with its initiation.

The interaction terms in the bottom
of Table 4 reflect behavioral changes
between the two surveys. We included
in our model only interactions significant at the 10 per cent level or below.
The most important changes in the determinants of breastfeeding initiation
were related to the regional and residential covariates. The positive influence of residence in the sierra strengthened over time. The increment to the
log-odds :of ever breastfeeding increased from 0.44 in the WFS to 1.30
(0.44 + 0.86) in the DHS. Residential
differentials, on the other hand, narrowed between the two surveys, although only the differential between
Lima and other urban areas narrowed

‘by a statistically significant amount.

Also, although children whose fathers
were in sales or service occupations
were among the least likely to be
breastfed in the mid-1970’s, they were
the most likely to be breastfed in the
mid-1980’s.
We also found several significant
changes in the determinants of breastfeeding duration. In the mid-1970’s,
children of women working in professional occupations were breastfed for significantly shorter durations

than children of nonworking women
(B = —0.90). This differential was virtually nonexistent in the 1986 DHS
(B = —0.90 + 0.88 = —0.02). Differentials by husband’s education were
likewise eliminated. The effects estimates increased from ~—1.02 in the
WES to —0.20 (-1.02 + 0.82) in the
DHS. The effects of husband’s occupation also changed between the two
surveys. In the WES, children of manual workers breastfed for significantly
shorter durations than children whose
fathers worked in agriculture; in the
DHS, the relationship was reversed.
We also found that female children
were breastfed longer than male children in the DHS but not in the WFS.
Finally, ever-use of modern contraception, other than the pill, was associated
with shorter breastfeeding only in the
WES; in the DHS, the effect was eliminated and perhaps even reversed.

PREDICTED INCIDENCE AND DURATION
OF BREASTFEEDING: RESULTS FROM A
SIMULATION EXERCISE

To help interpret changes in breastfeeding behavior over time, we performed a simulation exercise that
calculated predicted proportions of
children who were ever breastfed and
mean durations of breastfeeding based
on coefficients estimated separately for
the two surveys.!° To do so, we calculated a predicted value for each child
and then obtained a mean value for all
children in the sample.1! Predicted val
10These regressions used sample weights to accurately reflect population values.

11Predicted durations were calculated by numerically integrating the area under the survivorship
curve. The height of the survivorship curve at each
age was Calculated by taking the anti-log of the predicted spline function.

mean of the predicted value of all

within subgroups over time. Several
important changes occurred in the population characteristics between the two
surveys. For example, women’s average educational attainment rose rapidly, a larger proportion of women
used modern contraceptives—at least
partly because of an increase in the
availability of modern contraceptive
methods—and women became more
integrated into the labor force. Given
such changes in population distribution, we might have expected decreases in breastfeeding incidence and
duration. On the other hand, women

within specific subgroups may have become more likely to breastfeed, and to
breastfeed for longer durations.

To examine the effect of behavioral
changes within subgroups, we predicted how breastfeeding initiation
and duration would have changed weré
breastfeeding behavior, but not the
population distribution, allowed to
change. This simulation could be accomplished in two ways. First, we
applied the DHS coefficients to the
WFS data to obtain predicted values
in our simulations. These results
showed what breastfeeding incidence

not identical (not shown); it thus made
a difference which survey we treated as

breastfeeding initiation and duration
had behavioral changes not occurred.
The proportion of infants who were
ever breastfed would have declined by
1.6 percentage points, and the mean
duration by 1.0 month, had there been
no changes in behavior. Behavioral
changes that took place during the decade, however, more than compensated for the declines predicted by
shifts in population characteristics. A
net increase in both breastfeeding initiation and mean duration resulted. In
fact, this was true in every population
subgroup. The net effect in all cases
was an overall increase in the proportion of children who were ever breastfed, and in mean duration. Finally,
since increases in breastfeeding initiation confound the estimates of mean
duration, note that in the results based
on the multivariate analysis, increases
in breastfeeding initiation could not account for the rise in mean duration for
any subgroup.

DISCUSSION

Most of the changes in characteristics of women between the WFS and
the DHS would have predicted a
decline in both breastfeeding initiation and duration in Peru. In contrast,
our analyses demonstrated that both
breastfeeding initiation and duration
increased in Peru between 1977 and
1986. Although increases in the proportions of children who were ever
breastfed accounted for a small portion
of the observed rise in mean duration,
in no subcategory of interest did such
increases account for all of the observed rise in mean duration.

Furthermore, although changes in
the distribution of women across pop

ulation subgroups would have been expected to lead to decreases in both the
proportion of children who were ever
breastfed and the mean duration of
breastfeeding, the potential for decline
was more than overcome by changes in
behavior. For all categories of our explanatory variables, we found a net increase in breastfeeding initiation and
duration. The largest absolute increases in both initiation and duration
generally occurred among children of
women who were least likely to initiate
breastfeeding and who breastfed for
shorter durations than other women.
These findings were similar to those reported by Grummer-Strawn (1991a)
for a number of other developing countries. Our results thus suggest that declines in breastfeeding initiation and
duration that are attributable to modernization in developing countries are
not inevitable. This fact has important
implications for health policy makers
and those concerned with such potential declines in developing countries.
Two factors could account for the increases we found in breastfeeding initiation and duration in Peru between
1977 and 1986. In the 1980’s, the Ministry of Health began breastfeeding
promotion campaigns and encouraged
breastfeeding during diarrheal episodes as a key component of its policy
to combat diarrheal morbidity and
mortality (Altobelli, 1988; Instituto
Nacional de Estadistica, 1988). Because the effectiveness of such campaigns likely depends on access to
health care professionals and the
news media, increases in breastfeeding initiation and duration among urban women, among highly educated
women, and among women who were
users of modern contraceptives (and

242

thus had contact with modern health
care professionals) may indeed reflect
that the campaigns are having a positive impact. The severe economic
downturn during the first half of the
1980’s may also have played a role in
increasing both breastfeeding initiation
and duration, since breast milk may
have served as a substitute for other
infant foods. Economic circumstances
are likely to have influenced behavior
among the poor and the uneducated.
Like the more socioeconomically advantaged women, these women were
more likely to ever breastfeed their
children and to have done so for longer
durations in the mid-1980’s than a decade earlier, although the increases
were of smaller magnitude.

The reasons behind the observed
changes in behavior have important
implications for future trends. If the

economy is a key factor here, we might
expect some decline in breastfeeding
initiation and duration, at least among
the poor, if the economy improves. On
the other hand, if breastfeeding promotion campaigns are responsible for
the observed changes in behavior, the
increases are more likely to have a lasting impact.
