Human Sex Ratio as a Function of the
Timing of Insemination Within the

Menstrual Cycle: A Review

Elizabeth Murphy Whelan

Demographic Materials, Inc.

Our oldest historical records document
that man has been persistent in his attempts to unravel the mystery of human
sex determination (Cederqvist and Fuchs,
1970). Sincere, well-meaning philosophers
and medical researchers have presented a
myriad of “critical” factors which they felt
could have a preconception influence on the
sex of a child. Everything from lunar forces
to autosuggestion to aperitifs of wine and
lion’s blood have at some point held the
spotlight as the most effective means of preselecting the conception of either a son or
a daughter.

In addition, since the time of Hippocrates, there has been support for the hypothesis that the timing of intercourse within
the menstrual cycle is an important variable in determining the sex of the forthcoming child. However, the early insemination timing theories were not well
grounded in the facts of human reproduction and the physiology of sex determination. They revolved around the belief that
menstruation and ovulation occurred simultaneously; that is, that human females, just
as lower animals experienced vaginal
bleeding at the time of maximum fertility.

 

 

 

Even among those guided by these similar,
although incorrect, views about reproductive processes, there was no agreement as
to which portion of the cycle favored male
or female conceptions.

What follows is a review of the various
historical hypotheses that linked human
sex ratio to cycle day of insemination and
a presentation of the conclusions of the
most recent research in this area.

POSTMENSTRUAL INSEMINATION

Hippocrates was possibly the first to present the argument that male births were
most likely to result from coitus in the immediate postmenstrual period. According to
Guillemeau (cited in Guttmacher, 1933, p.
162):

Hippocrates writes in his booke (concerning

superfoetation) of the means how to get

man or woman childe. Hee that will beget

a son must know his wife as soon as her

courses are staved, and then try to the ut
most of his strength; but if hee desire to get

a daughter, hee must company with his wife

a good while after her courses or at the
time when she hath them.

During the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, a number of researchers, some of whom determined coital dates

by ascertaining when their subjects’ soldier
husbands were home on leave, presented
data which supported Hippocrates’ hypothesis. As indicated in Table 1, the per

ones, favored male conceptions. Dechman
and Tucker based their timing advice on
variations of the “‘parental strength” theory
of sex determination. Presenting what he

centage of male births following early cycle
insemination was reported by these researchers as being between 52 and 84 per
cent, as compared with a male birth percentage of between 13 and 52 per cent for
inseminations on days 15-23.

However, not all the data presented in
the early 1900’s supported the view that
early inseminations favored males. For
example, Blumenfeld (1925, cited in James,
1971) found that “postmenstrum” conceptions yielded only 43 per cent males. Similarly, Nurnberger (1918, cited in James,
1971), using data supplied from the German War Office, reported a slight increase
in male births (55 per cent) when insemination took place during days 15-23 following the beginning of the menstrual flow, as
compared to a 51 per cent prevalence of
male births when insemination occurred in
the first 9 days of the cycle.

INTERMENSTRUAL INSEMINATION

Dechman (1916), Tucker (1925), and
Carr (1938) were among those who claimed
that intermenstrual inseminations, not early

termed the ‘Law of Latent Reserve Energy” (for which he reserved a copyright),
Dechman (1916) claimed that the sex of
a child was the result of a struggle between
the egg and sperm, the victory going to the
one that was weakest at the time of conception. In response to what Dechman
called the “Law of Preservation of Kind,”
the victorious cell then engendered a child
of the “opposite” sex. The timing advice
which resulted from this rather enigmatic
pattern of events was that couples desiring
a male should focus intercourse midcycle
when the egg was allegedly deteriorating.
The egg would thus “win” the struggle,
which would lead to the conception of a
child of the “opposite” sex, in this case
a male,

Tucker (1925), who also believed in midcycle insemination for male births, discarded the “latent reserve energy” theory
and merely claimed that the child was always the opposite sex of the parent who
was “stronger” at the moment of insemination. Tucker thus maintained that since a
woman was naturally weak at or around

Vol. 21, No. 4

the time of her menstrual flow, prospective
parents seeking a son should focus their
coital activity in the intermenstrual phase
of the wife’s cycle when she was in her full
vigor.

Carr (1938) agreed with Dechman and
Tucker’s timing advice, for a different reason. He believed there was a natural struggle between the “female” egg and “male”
sperm, but that the victor cell directly
determined the sex of the child without any
“crossover” activity. His fundamental law
was that all female germ cells strive to
produce a girl; all male germ cells, a boy.
Thus, during the intermenstrual phase when
the egg was allegedly in an advanced stage
of aging, the sperm would easily win the
struggle, and a male conception would
result. As stated by Carr (1938, p. 27), it
“appears that the life of every boy is a
spark caught by the flickering failing torch
of the dying mother germ” while a girl
originates “in full flame of mother power.”

Much earlier, in 1863, French veterinary
surgeon Thury had observed that queen
bees lay their female eggs first. He assumed
this general theory was also applicable to
humans and therefore recommended that
couples seeking sons have intercourse some
13-17 days after the beginning of the wife’s
menstrual period (cited in MacFadden and
Clinton, 1935). Thury based his theory on
the belief that the sex of the child was a
function of the age of the ovum, the more
fully ripened ovum leading to a male, the
imperfect one resulting in a female. Thury
believed that insemination during the
transition from the female to male ovum
phase might result in a hermaphroditic
child.

PREMENSTRUAL INSEMINATION

At least three independent twentieth
century writers vigorously denied that early

or middle cycle inseminations were desirable
for male births.

Cox (1923), who claimed that any
woman with ordinary common sense and
careful observation could determine the
duration of her own ovum, generally agreed
with Thury’s theory that the sex of the
child was determined by the age of the
ovum. However, Cox counseled would-be
parents of a boy to postpone coitus until
around day 21 of the wife’s cycle to ensure
that the ovum had matured to the fullest
stage of its development.

McElrath (1911) also recommended late
inseminations for male conceptions, although he arrived at his conclusion in a
different manner. McElrath wrote that a
male birth followed the fertilization of
a newly released fresh ovum. Intercourse
around the nineteenth day of the cycle
might trigger ovulation well before it would
have occurred spontaneously (that is, just
before menstrual flow), and thus a fresh
ovum could be fertilized immediately after
its release from the ovary. McElrath felt
that at least two pieces of sociological evidence supported his theory. Conceptions
occurring during the first month of marriage
were more likely to be male since it was
the prevailing custom to schedule weddings
about two weeks after the end of the menstrual flow. Conversely, according to McElrath, illegitiriate births were more likely
to be female, since harlots were less likely
to abstain from intercourse in the days
during and just after the menstrual flow,
thus maximizing the probability of fertilizing a “stale egg.”

MacFadden (1935) was also a member
of the school that advocated late insemination for male births. In addition to correlating intercourse patterns with moon
phases, he recommended intercourse on
the 21-23 days of the cycle, or 5 to 7 days

before the next menstrual period, to increase the odds of a male birth.

CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT TIMING
OF INSEMINATION AND HUMAN
SEX RATIO

More recent attempts to evaluate the
effect of insemination timing within the
menstrual cycle on the human sex ratio
have taken note of four important facts
of reproductive physiology, which have only
been documented relatively recently. First,
human ovulation usually occurs some 12 to
16 days before the beginning of the next
menstrual flow (Odell and Moyer, 1971).
Second, the duration of fertility of the female ovum is some 6—24 hours (Hartman,
1936). Third, the sex of the child is determined by the fertilizing sperm. Fourth, the
normal fertility duration of the human
sperm is 28-48 hours (Odell and Moyer,
1971).

Given these observations, the hypotheses
about insemination time and sex outcome
have become very specific and focus on the
time of ovulation, the period of ovum survival, and the interval of sperm survival.
However, due to the variations In menstrual
cycle lengths and the related fluctuations
in the temporal relationship of ovulation
and the menstrual flow, the “potential
fertile period” of a large group of women
necessarily covers more than 3 or 4 days.

Reporting on Kleegman’s (1966, 1954)
data on the sex of children of women
who had undergone artificial insemination,
Shettles (1970, 1961, 1960) indicated that
insemination immediately before ovulation
favored male births while earlier insemination more frequently resulted in female
babies; that is,

With exposure to pregnancy 2 to 24 hours

before ovulation, the babies were predom
inantly male (78%); with exposure to
pregnancy 36 or more hours before ovula
tion, the babies were predominantly female
(Rorvik and Shettles, 1970a, pp. 53~54).

Social Biology

In a popular book (Rorvik and Shettles,
19702) and in numerous popular articles
(Moreau, 1973; Ennis, 1972; Irwin, 1970;
Rorvik and Shettles, 19705), Shettles
recommends that couples who want a boy
should engage in coitus just before the
moment of ovulation when the egg is high
in the Fallopian tube and the reproductive
tract tends to be very alkaline. On the other
hand, he suggests that couples desiring a
daughter have intercourse in the early part
of the cycle and avoid coitus in the two days
prior to ovulation. Shettles claims that
androsperm are incapacitated by acid secretions in the reproductive tract. Since androsperm have a natural tendency to swim
faster than gynosperm, intercourse occurring at or shortly after ovulation when the
reproductive tract is likely to be alkaline
should lead to a higher probability of impregnation by an androsperm. However,
Shettles’ two main premises have been
challenged: Barlow and Vosa (1970) and
Rothschild (1960) questioned his methodology for identifying androsperm and gynosperm, and Diasio and Glass (1971) present
data which suggest that his theory that an
alkaline environment favors androsperm
mobility is not supported by laboratory
tests.

Shettles’ conclusions are based exclusively on artificial insemination statistics
and are in conflict with a number of the
early twentieth-century reports which suggested that postmenstrual natural insemination favors male conceptions (see Table
1, adapted from James, 1970). Guerrero
(1971, 1970) appears to have resolved this
conflict by presenting a series of data for
both artificially and naturally inseminated
women. Like Kleegman (1966, 1954) and
Shettles (1970, 1961, 1960), Guerrero notes
an excess of girls following artificial insemination three or more days before ovulation
(as indicated by an upward shift in basal
body temperature) or one or more days

Vol. 21, No. 4

after it. On the other hand, he reports that
the opposite trend is observed for natural
insemination. An excess of boys is associated with inseminations taking place four
or more days before the shift or one or more
days after it. The probability of males resulting from natural insemination is decreased in the days around the thermal
shift.

The underlying causes of this marked
differential in the effect of insemination
timing between natural and artificial insemination are yet unclear. Perhaps the
physiological changes that occur during the
menstrual cycle and those which may occur
during sexual intercourse but not during
artificial insemination (particularly female
orgasm) play a significant role in the selection process of androsperm and gynosperm.

DISCUSSION

The late nineteenth century and early
twentieth century observations that inseminations early in the menstrual cycle favor
male births, the artificial insemination
statistics which correlate inseminations at
ovulation with increased male births, and
the Guerrero (1971, 1970) data which appear to resolve those apparent discrepancies, all suggest that the timing of
insemination within a woman’s menstrual
cycle may play a role in determining the
sex of her child. More clinical research
which correlates date of insemination, menstrual-cycle day, and sex outcome is necessary to further elucidate this relationship.

Sex Ratio and Timing of Insemination

383

In the collection and presentation of data
in this area, it is important that both sensitive and standard means of ovulation
detection be employed to avoid confusion
in methodology. For example, Benendo
(1970) uniformly identified the time of
ovulation as “14 days before the beginning
of the menstrual flow,” thus rendering his
results incomparable to those of Kleegman
(1966, 1954) and Guerrero (1971, 1970)
who relied on individual basal body temperature readings.

In addition to further research on the
correlation of menstrual histories and insemination dates, more information is
needed about the biological factors which
may be operative in bringing about the
insemination timing effect. For instance,
if shifts in vaginal or cervical pH are
important in determining various sex ratios,
one might expect that contraceptive failures
associated with those birth control methods
which may alter the pH of the reproductive
tract (the progesterone-only pill, vaginal
spermicides, intrauterine devices) would
reflect a skewed sex ratio. Similarly, one
might note an unusual sex ratio among
women who consistently had orgasm prior
to insemination.

A closer analysis of anthropological,
demographic, and epidemiologic data on
natural variations in the sex ratio would
also be invaluable to both the evaluation of
clinical hypotheses related to insemination
timing and to the development of new areas
of investigation.
