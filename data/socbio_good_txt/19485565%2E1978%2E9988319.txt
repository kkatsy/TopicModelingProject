Contemporary Views of Euthanasia:

A Regional Assessment

ABSTRACT: A survey of euthanasia attitudes of 245 college students at six universities in three
regions of the United States was completed using two scales which assessed ideological position
toward and behavioral endorsement of euthanasia actions. Geographical region, religious participation, mass media, class rank, socioeconomic status, and personality (locus of control) were
associated in various ways with the scales employed. In addition, the attitudinal and behavioral

dimensions were moderately associated.

We know that Americans in general
hold strong feelings about issues concerning life and death. Psychology Today
(Shneidman, 1970) received responses
from over thirty thousand readers to a
questionnaire about death—ten thousand
more responses than a previous all-timehigh response to a survey on sex. Recently,
national focus has been directed to the
Karen Ann Quinlan case where parents of
the comatose young woman waged and
finally won a court battle for permission to
turn off life-supporting machines. Besides
this nationally publicized case, the general
aftermath of the Supreme Court decision
on abortion and breakthroughs in surgery,
organ transplants, and life support systems have engendered a new interest in
euthanasia.

Several books illustrate the increased
interest in this highly debatable concept
(Williams, 1973; Maguire, 1974; Russell,
1975; Wilson, 1975). The authors discuss
medical and social changes that have occurred and their implications for legislative bodies, definitions of death, medical
ethics, the law, and religious considerations.

Wilson (1975) noted that a review of the
literature on euthanasia reveals considerable debate and disagreement over various
issues. “Arguments for death with dignity
inspired by instances of hopeless suffering
are countered by arguments warning of
the dangerous consequences of assuming
the right to take life” (p. 47). According to
Wilson, this debate developed and will
continue for three principal reasons: the
complexity of medical and legal factors,
conflicting societal values, and the taboo
nature of the topic of death.

Wilson (1975) refers to a 1937 Fortune
survey which showed that 50.5 per cent of
respondents rejected while 45 per cent approved of euthanasia when permission
was obtained from the family and/or medical board. A poll conducted in 1962 indicated that over 30 per cent of American
doctors concurred that euthanasia was
justifiable in certain cases. Of this group,
40 per cent approved of the practice for
severely defective infants, while 41 per
cent called for states to enact legislation to
allow this practice under specific guidelines (Russell, 1975). In addition, of a
thousand geriatric nurses responding to a

62

Vol. 25, No. 1

questionnaire, most believed that elderly
and dying patients should be allowed to
die free of the typical push to save life
(Russell, 1975). Russell asserts that “studies have shown also that most people fear
prolonged dying much more than they fear
death” (1975, p. 168).

The American Institute of Public Opinion noted how little attitudes toward
euthanasia changed between 1936 (39 per
cent favorable; 45 per cent unfavorable)
and 1950 (37 per cent favorable; 54
per cent unfavorable) (Wilson, 1972).
However, a 1973 survey by Louis Harris
revealed that 62 per cent would favor
passive euthanasia and 38 per cent would
oppose it, while only 37 per cent would
favor active euthanasia and 53 per cent
would oppose it. A Gallup Poll, also completed in 1973, showed that 53 per cent of
the respondents agreed that a doctor
should be allowed to terminate a person’s
life when he or she is terminally ill and
the family request it (Wilson, 1972). Further, Beswick (1970), in assessing attitudes
toward the question of taking life, reported that a single predictive attitude did
not prevail: “A person’s favouring one
kind of killing is not a reliable indication
of whether he will favour other kinds of
killing” (p. 120).

The United States is a pluralistic society
and attitudes toward euthanasia are
reflected on a number of demographic factors (Wilson, 1972; Russell, 1975). Religious affiliation accounts for some of the
difference, Catholics being more opposed
than Protestants. Being involved with a
specific person over the life-death question
also influences one’s attitude.

We believe it is important to ascertain
the attitudes toward euthanasia of respondents who are just now achieving adulthood and to determine how these attitudes
are affected by age, sex of subject, religious affiliation and activity level, and
geographical region of the nation. How

strongly held are pro and con positions on
mercy killing? Do people change their attitudes when confronted with actual experiences of death with family and
friends? Is it possible to differentiate between a passive ideological stance on
euthanasia and a more active-participant
ideological position? These were some of
the main questions which guided us in our
study of 245 college students on various
aspects of euthanasia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
INSTRUMENT CONSTRUCTION

A search of the available research on
euthanasia failed to uncover an adequate
assessment tool. Therefore, two measures
were constructed to assess college students’ views on euthanasia. Previous research on college students’ concept of personal control suggests that one can maintain a cultural ideological belief in such
values as the Protestant Ethic but not see
them as being personally applicable to
one’s own behavior (Gurin and Epps,
1975). Thus, the first measures euthanasia
ideology while the second assesses agreement with specific euthanasia behaviors.

Initially, a series of items were written
which reflected anti- and pro-euthanasia
beliefs. These items were administered to
103 male and female undergraduate students at the Utah State University. Each
item was responded to with a five point
Likert-type scale ranging from strongly
agree to strongly disagree. These items
were then intercorrelated and correlated
with a total score. Table 1 summarizes the
correlative evidence for the Euthanasia
Ideology Scale’s internal consistency. The
four items which reached the specific validity criteria were also administered to a
group of 25 undergraduates with a retest
three weeks later. The test-retest correlation reached significance at the 0.05 level
(y = 0.81).

* Euthanasia scores for Items 1! and 2 are scored in the strongly disagree direction; the converse is true for the remaining two items.

Second, six behavioral items (Table 2)
were constructed from actual euthanasia
cases reported in the media. Using a dichotomy suggested elsewhere (Maguire,
1974; Russell, 1975; Wilson, 1975), we
constructed active and passive behavioral
episodes. Active items measured endorsement of behavior requiring personal initiative leading to early life termination.
Passive items measured endorsement of
refraining from initiating life-sustaining
techniques.

Additional validation evidence was collected during the investigation to be reported here. Concurrent validity for the
two newly constructed scales was assessed
by comparing the responses of the 245 undergraduates to a euthanasia scale previously constructed for use in Australia
(Beswick, 1970). Beswick’s Killing Scale
correlated significantly with the Euthanasia Ideology Scale (ry = 0.54), Active (7 = 0.67) and Passive (r = 0.65)
Euthanasia Behavioral Items, and the
total sum score for the latter two scales (r
= 0.71). Contrary to our expectations that
ideological beliefs would be only moderately associated with personal actions,
ideological responses were significantly

correlated with behavioral items. Furthermore, agreement with passive
euthanasia behavior was likewise associated with agreement for active behavioral decisions (see Table 3). Therefore, we
were unable to analyze active and passive
scores separately and have chosen instead
to use a total behavioral score measure.

PROCEDURE

A total of 245 undergraduates in classes
in family studies and human development
programs at six universities across the
United States were administered the
Euthanasia Ideology Scale, Euthanasia
Behavioral Items, Beswick (1970) Killing
Scale, and the Levenson (1974) InternalExternal Locus of Control Scales. The instructors in the respective universities
administered the instruments in group
settings and monitored the data collection
process according to directions set up by
the investigators. The students were asked
to cooperate with the research program,
and background information on each subject was collected to determine media
awareness, mobility, socioeconomic status, and previous experience with death
in their respective families. These types of

data were collected in order to determine
what effect, if any, they would have on the
ideology and behavioral items of the
euthanasia scales.

RESULTS

A series of stepwise multiple regression
techniques were completed in three separate analyses where nineteen demographic variables were regressed on the dependent measures of Euthanasia Ideology,
total Euthanasia Behavior Score, and the
Beswick Killing Scale. For each of the
euthanasia measures, the nineteen predictor variables were entered one at a time
into the stepwise multiple equation until
no additional factor could add_ significantly (p < 0.05) to the prediction of
the outcome measures. Only those variables which contribute significantly to one
or more euthanasia measures will be discussed here.

EUTHANASIA IDEOLOGY

Four of the independent variables accounted for 26 per cent of the shared variance (see Table 4). Religious participation,

the strongest predictor variable was negatively associated with holding proeuthanasia ideology. The geographic factor indicates a significant West-to-East
pro-euthanasia relationship. Students in
the East (mean, 16.16; SD, 3.44) were
more pro-euthanasia than students in the
Midwest (mean, 14.45; sp, 3.21) or the

West (mean, 12.71; SD, 4.79). The class
rank factor further indicates a liberalizing
effect over the four years of a college experience. Finally, grade point average was
likewise associated with pro-euthanasia
attitudes. The latter factor is typically
viewed as a behavioral index of academic
achievement, implying that academically
successful students are more likely to endorse euthanasia ideology than are less
scholastically inclined students.

EUTHANASIA BEHAVIOR SCORE

Once again, religious participation appeared as the single most influential factor
in predicting endorsement of passive and
active euthanasia behavior (see Table 5).

The more highly involved students were in
religious activities, the less likely they
were to endorse euthanasia behavior. In
addition, a university attendance factor
was found, similar to the geographicregion regression pattern in the first statistical series, which suggests a West-to-East
ideological endorsement. Brigham Young
University students were least likely to
endorse euthanasia behavior (mean,
18.31; SD, 1.31), followed by students
tested at Utah State University (mean,
24.35; SD, 1.38) and the University of
Montana (mean, 24.97; sp, 3.36). Students at the University of Nebraska
(mean, 26.87; SD, 1.31) and the University
of Texas (mean, 27.94; SD, 1.29) endorsed
euthanasia behavior more than the

former, but less se than those at Florida
State University (mean, 30.23; sD, 1.45).
Furthermore, birth order was negatively
associated with endorsement of euthanasia
behavior. Later-borns were more likely
than first-borns to endorse euthanasia behaviors. Finally, belief that powerful others control one’s life was also positively
associated with support for euthanasia behavior.

Religious participation was again negatively associated with euthanasia attitudes
(see Table 6). Belief in the controlling na

ture of powerful others, a West-to-East

were predictive of euthanasia attitudes.

ADDITIONAL FACTORS

Several additional factors which were
expected to have some relationship with
euthanasia attitudes failed to reach an acceptable level of significance. Specifically,
the size of town from which the student
came, the degree of previous mobility, experience with the pain and suffering of
someone terminally ill, and death in the
family were, unexpectedly, not associated
with euthanasia ideology development or
endorsement of euthanasia behavior.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In summary, the present investigation
has provided an assessment device which

Euthanasia

67

allows researchers to examine the relationship between ideological stance and behavioral endorsement. Although previous
research suggests an active versus passive
dichotomy, these data provide little evidence for making such a distinction. Furthermore, ideological beliefs were consistently associated with behavioral endorsement. These data showed consistently, but not dramatically, that ideology
and behavioral dimensions covary. Thus,
it can be said that to some degree
euthanasia attitudes are predictive of endorsement of euthanasia behavior.

In addition, our data show that attitudes toward the issue of euthanasia are
influenced by religious participation, geographical region, mass media, age as
reflected by class rank, and socioeconomic
status, and that the influence of geographical region is somewhat masked by the
factor of religious participation. Perceived
ability to chart one’s destiny versus external control of one’s life was most likely to
interact with a pro-euthanasia ideology in
the middle class. However, endorsement
of euthanasia was not directly affected by
locus of control or socioeconomic status.

While we were surprised that degree of
mobility and familiarity with pain, suffering, and death were not associated with
either of the research constructs, this fact
can perhaps be partially explained by the
age and life-experience variables. Our population members are young, nonmarried, are not likely to have witnessed the
death of parents and other loved ones, and
have recently left the confines of family
security. For such a sample, acceptance of
euthanasia may be a denial of the pain and
grief associated with death. Also, these
students may have had a hard time placing themselves realistically in a euthanasia/death-related situation since few
have had direct experiences with pain,
suffering, and death.

The religious and regional differences

are important as variables but also point
to subtle factors operating within regions.
Students in the Midwest and West are
more likely to have been reared in and
reflect a life style free of urban sprawl and
congestion which may make them more
pro-life. They may reflect an attitude of
“room for all” and a more pristine feeling
for nature at work.

The data suggest that as more people
receive a college education, pro-euthanasia attitudes are likely to increase.
With an increase in the impact of mass

et al. Social Biology
media, more of the population influenced
by post-high-school education, and the
long-term secularization of society, we
project more general acceptance of both
passive and active euthanasia. In addition, it should be noted that our sample
population represents youthful America.
As persons grow older, it is believed that
their religious beliefs tend to be influenced
by secular or scientific orientations (Schibles, 1974), which also suggests an increase in pro-euthanasia attitudes in years
to come.
