A previous study from this laboratory (Milner and Calitz, 1968)has shown the mean strength of the B erythrocyte antigens of South African Caucasians and Asiatics to be very similar. The Bantu were found to have considerably stronger antigens. The coefficient of variation of the quantitative assays on the Bantu and Caucasians was found to be Email andsimilar, while that of the Asiatics was much greater. A classification of the Asiatic samples bysect indicated that the strength of the group B antigens might vary from sect to sect.
This paper presents the results of quantitative assays of the B antigen in the four main ethnic groups occurring in theAsiatic population of Durban and its immediate environs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Twenty-eight cell samples from each of the four main ethnic groups in Durban and immediate surroundings were assayed.The Tamil, Telegu, and Hindi donors were selected on the basis of home language, and the Moslems by religion. The blood was taken into acid citrate dextrose (NIH formula A), and the cells were stored at 4 10° C for up to 48hours before testing.

The same anti-B serum was used throughout these experiments. I t was prepared by pooling ten samples obtained from unstimulated group A donors. The serum had an agglutinating titre of 1/256 by the conventional doubling dilution technique and gave log-probit regression lines that were straight in the range 12% to 97% agglutination (Solomon, Gibbs, and Bowdler, 1965).
The method used for quantitation of haemagglutination was exactly as described previously (Milner and Calitz, 1968).The data was analyzed as a percentage of the control after the manner of Solomon, Gibbs, and Bowdler (1965).
RESULTS
Table 1 gives various statistical parameters of the findings.
Variance analysis of thedata showed significant differences between theTamil-and Telegu-speaking people (P < 0.01), between the Tamil- and Hindi-speaking people (P < 0.01), and between the Telegu-speaking people andtheMoslems (P < 0.05).
Where there were no significant differences between the observed variances, the / test was used todetermine whether the ob-

served means differed significantly or not (see Table 2).
Where there were significant differences between the observed variances, the MannWhitney U test was used (see Table 3). There were significant differences between all except the Hindi-speaking Hindus and Moslems.
ORIGINS OF THE ASIATICS OF NATAL
The Tamil-speaking people of Natal came from the provinces of Trichonopoly, Tanjore, North and South Arcut, Salem, and Chingleput (Kuper, 1960, andMistry, 1965) (see Fig. 1). The Telegu-speaking people camefromthe Andhra province, mainly from the districts of Vizagapatam, East and West Godavari, Kistna, Guntur, Nellore, and Chittoor.
The Tamils have their own language, script, and literature; for unknown reasons they took over the caste system of the Aryan Hindus from the north (Nowbath, 1964, p. 41). The Telegu, on the other hand, practiced the Dravidian tribal system of culture and also developed their own language, script, and literature, called Andhras (Nowbath, 1964). While both the Tamil and Telegu are Hindus by religion, they differ in certain beliefs and customs; for example, on the occasion of Deepavali (a religious festival known as the Festival of the Lights) Telegus become vegetarians, like the Hindispeaking people, while the Tamils do not. It is thus obvious that the Tamil and Telegu differ ethnically and geographically from the Moslems and the Hindi-speaking people of the northern part of India and also differ linguistically and culturally from each other.
The Hindi-speaking people of Natal came from the north and north-eastern parts of India, mainly from the provinces of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal (Kuper, 1960).
The Moslems in Natal came predominantly from the provinces of Kathiawar,

Surat, and Porbandar, and the Moslems who stayed in Durban belong predominantly to the Sunni sect (Kuper, 1960).
The Mohammedans of the subcontinent of India may be divided into two classes: the pure Mohammedans from the Mogul and Pathan conquering races, and Mohammedan converts who differ little racially from the surrounding Hindu population from which

they originally sprang. South African Indian Moslems were of the second class, many of them representing families converted as little as 200 years ago (Kuper, 1960; Nowbath, 1964). Ethnically, therefore, one would not expect to find major differences between South African Moslems and the Hindi-speaking Hindus. The quantitative studies presented here appear to confirm this.
I t would seem that the strength of B antigens can be used to show relative subtle ethnological differences. Gibbs, Akeroyd, and Zapf (1961) showed that differences existed between the strengths of the B antigens in Caucasians, Negroes, and Mongoloids, and previous studies from this laboratory

have shown differences between Caucasians, Bantu, and Asiatics (Milner and Calitz, 1968). This work demonstrates differences between people of the same ethnic group.
