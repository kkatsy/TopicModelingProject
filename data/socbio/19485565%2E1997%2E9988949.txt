ABSTRACT: In the United States, national health status data pertaining to Asian and Pacific Islander (API) Americans are rarely disaggregated. By aggregating API data, however, the poor health status of some API groups is often masked by the favorable health status of others. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: (1) to compare mortality rates of the five major ethnic groups in Hawaii (Caucasians, Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, and Hawaiians) and (2) to explore methodological issues related to comparative studies of API health indicators. Standardized and agespecific mortality rates and 95 per cent confidence intervals for major causes of death were estimated for 1990 based on Hawaii vital records and population data. In general, death rates were highest for Hawaiians and lowest for Japanese and Chinese, illustrating the importance of API data disaggregation and suggesting that special attention be paid to improving the health of Hawaiians. Methodologically, the study demonstrated that, while some compromises in analysis are required, legitimate comparisons across API groups can be made if data sets are available.

Investigators of Asian and Pacific Islander (API) Americans have been calling for the disaggregation of API-associated data for almost two decades, yet, due to relatively small numbers of API Americans, aggregation remains a common practice in demography and health. Hawaii, with its large number and proportion of API groups, allows disaggregation of at least four major API groups--Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, and Hawaiians--although methodological issues are still of concern. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: (1) to compare 1990 mortality rates of four major API groups in Hawaii with Caucasians and (2) to explore methodological issues related to comparative studies of health indicators across small ethnic groups.
Taken as a whole, the Asian and Pacific Islander (API) American population is the most rapidly growing ethnic category in the United States. While API

Americans are often discussed en masse, the API label, in fact, encompasses over 30 distinct cultural groups. For example, Asian Americans include third- and fourth-generation Japanese Americans, well-educated and English-speaking Chinese immigrants from Hong Kong, their less Westernized cousins from mainland China, and non-English speaking refugees from the countries that comprised Indochina. The Pacific Islander group includes Hawaiians, who are indigenous to the Hawaiian islands, as well as recent immigrants from Samoa, Tonga, and Micronesia (Takeuchi and Young, 1994).
Although rapidly growing, API Americans still account for a small percentage of the total U.S. population (about 3 per cent), numbering about. 7.3 million in 1990 (Takeuchi and Young, 1994). Many state and national surveys tend to combine data from these disparate API groups. When combined, the data suggest

213

that API Americans are healthier than the general population in the United States, and API Americans have thus been referred to as the "model minority" (Tanjasiri et al., 1995). There is evidence, however, that this "lumping" of different ethnic groups into an API category results in the masking of the poorer health status of some groups by the better health status of others. For example, previous studies have suggested that age-standardized mortality rates for Chinese, Japanese, and Filipinos are below those of Caucasians, while cancer mortality rates for Hawaiians are substantially higher than those for Caucasians, Chinese, Japanese, and Filipinos (Gardner, 1994; Lin-Fu, 1988; Yu and Liu, 1992).
In addition, API American mortality estimates for the United States have been questioned due to problems with the data. First, API Americans may be undercounted. While the U.S. Bureau of the Census estimated a 2.7 undercount of API in the 1990 census, a study in New York's Chinatown estimated an 18 per cent undercount by the census (Sung, 1991). Second, API respondents are usually undersampled in national studies, which may require that data be aggregated across years to build numbers. For example, Liu and Yu (1985) pooled 3 years of National Health Interview Survey data (1976-78) to yield stable estimates; still, they noted serious problems with this method. Undersampling is also an issue for longitudinal public health studies on Asian Pacific populations, where small absolute numbers in some categories reduce statistical power to detect significant over-time changes (Takeuchi and Young, 1994; Yu and Liu, 1994). Third is the issue of differential classification of ethnicity over time and across studies and states. To illustrate, an

examination of linked birth and infantdeath files from 1983 through 1985 revealed inconsistencies between birth and death data, with error rates as high as 33 per cent for Chinese, 49 per cent for Japanese, and 78 per cent for Filipinos (Hahn et al., 1992). Another study, which tested agreement of demographic data items collected by the census with death certificates, found that only 224 of the individuals in the sample were classified as API on both documents; 33 who were classified as API in the census were Caucasian on the death record and another 12 who were Caucasian in the census were API at death (Sorlie et al., 1992). In addition, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) has changed the way race is classified and statistics are reported. For example, the race classification procedure changed in 1969 to assign a respondent of mixed race to the first race listed; prior to this change, respondents with a mix that included black were always coded black. In addition, mortality data for Filipinos and Other Asians or Pacific Islanders were shown for the first time in 1979, and for Hispanics in 1984 (NCHS, 1994). Taken together, these constraints can lead to inaccurate estimates of rates and faulty comparisons (Hahn, 1992; Hahn and Stroup, 1994; Osborne and Feit, 1992).
In response to these problems, researchers who are concerned with improving our knowledge of the health status of API groups have recommended that federal agencies (1) expand and standardize API race/ethnic classification, (2) oversample API populations in national surveys, (3) develop more culturally appropriate survey measures, and (4) provide funds to the five states in which 68 per cent of all API live (California, Hawaii, New York, Illinois, and Texas) to support a thorough collection and analyses of data on their

API populations (Tanjasiri et al, 1995;Yu and Liu, 1992).
Looking at state-based estimates, the Asian American Health Forum's (1990) estimate of crude mortality rates for API groups in California represents one of the few available. While they found large mortality differences among API groups, the rates were not age-standardized and differences may be due partially to differences in age structures among the API groups. For example, the high death rates found for Japanese Americans in California may be an artifact of an older age structure for the Japanese group, most of whom are descendants of immigrants from the last century. Similarly, the relative low death rate for the Vietnamese group may be due to the fact that this group just started immigrating in 1975 and boasts few elders (Min, 1995).
The State of Hawaii has collected and analyzed vital statistics by ethnicity for almost a century and has found differences in mortality and life expectancy among the state's major ethnic groups. Although methodological issues are also of concern in Hawaii, the state has instituted a number of controls to assure the integrity of its vital records and the construction of mortality rates (see Methods). The state also boasts relatively large numbers of residents of API descent. Analyses of 1970 and 1980 surveillance data suggested that leading causes of death were similar across groups (heart disease, cancer, and stroke), but that mortality rates were highest for Hawaiians, intermediate for Caucasians and Filipinos, and lowest for Chinese and Japanese (Gardner, 1984; Johnson, 1989). In this study, 1990 mortality rates for these five groups were compared to see if ethnic differences persisted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Even with relatively desirable data for API health research in Hawaii, we still encountered data problems, including small numbers for certain ethnic groups by cause of death and by age, fluctuations in data across years, inconsistency in ethnicity coding in various data sources, and changes in ethnicity definitions and disease classifications over time. Methodological steps taken to overcome these problems are summarized here.
The death data were derived from Hawaii computer files of death records in the vital statistics system. Data were requested by gender, ethnicity, age, and cause of death by International Classification of Disease (ICD) code. The five major ethnic groups included in our analysis were Caucasian, Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian, and Japanese. Of the state's population of 1,108,229 in 1990, about 26 per cent were Caucasian, 23 per cent were Japanese, 19 per cent were Hawaiian, 15 per cent were Filipino, and 6 per cent were Chinese (Hawaii Department of Health, 1991). Smaller groups were omitted from the analysis, including African-Americans (2 per cent), Koreans (1 per cent), and several other groups which each account for less than 1 per cent of the population, e.g., Vietnamese, Laotian, Thai, Samoan, Micronesian, and Tongan. For analysis, death data were grouped in 10-year age intervals with an exception of the first two age groups (<1, 1_4; 5-14, 15-24, 25-34, 3 5 ^ 4 , 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, and 85+). Grouping data into 10-year, rather than 5-year, intervals was necessary due to small numbers in some age groups for some ethnicities. However, we required at least this many age categories to compensate

216

for the vastly different age structures among ethnic groups. For example, while Japanese comprise 23 per cent of the total population, they account for 40 per cent of the population age 60 and over. On the other hand, Hawaiians, which comprise 19 per cent of the total population, account for only 7 per cent of individuals 60 and over (Hawaii Executive Office on Aging, 1995). We also combined several ICD categories to achieve reasonable numbers for each cell, thus providing rates for death from all causes, from all heart diseases, and all malignant neoplasms. To deal with death data fluctuations year to year we used 5 years of data around the decade to calculate the average number of deaths for the decade. For example, for 1990, we obtained death data from 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992 and took the mean. As in other states, cause of death is certified by the attending physician; the remainder of the death certificate, including ethnicity, is completed by the funeral director (Hahn and Stroup, 1994; Rosenberg, 1989). Number of deaths by gender and major cause for 1990 are shown in Table 1.
Population data were based on the U.S. census but adjusted according to the ethnic distribution obtained through the state's own surveillance system (which collects more detailed data on ethnicity than does the U.S. census) and smoothed for seasonal fluctuations by a procedure developed by the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii (Wilken, 1994). Hawaii's Health Survey, established in 1969, is modeled after the U.S. National Health Survey and, in 1990, obtained data from a 2 per cent sample of households. In it, a respondent's ethnicity is determined through an algorithm based on the ethnicity of one's parents (up to two ethnicities per parent). If all four parental

codes are the same, that ethnicity is assigned. If a person is of mixed ethnicity and Hawaiian is mentioned, the person is classified as Hawaiian. If a person is of mixed ethnicity and Hawaiian is not mentioned, then the person is assigned the first ethnicity mentioned, which is considered the ethnicity that predominates. This method differs from that used by the U.S. census and results in a significantly different count for some ethnicities. For example, 30 per cent fewer Hawaiians are counted by the census compared to the state's surveillance method (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992). Because the Hawaii Health Survey method better matches the classification practice for the death certificate, it was chosen as the denominator over the U.S. census data (Yang et al., 1996). Population data for the five ethnic groups by gender and age strata for 1990 are displayed in Table 2.
We calculated both the standardized (to the 1940 population) and age-specific mortality rates, which were expressed per 100,000. The 95 per cent confidence intervals were estimated using a method developed by Mantel that is appropriate for poisson-type distributions such as death (Haenszel et al., 1962).
We originally intended to present mortality data for the major ethnic groups back to the turn of the century. However, our plan was hindered by three methodological concerns. First, classification of disease, through the ICD system, has changed over the century. Second, classification of ethnicity changed over time. Prior to statehood, territorial census takers assessed ethnicity through discussion with the respondent, recording the predominant ethnicity. When the federal census procedure was adopted, individuals were forced to choose a single ethnic cat-

malignant neoplasms are shown in Table 3. For all causes of death and heart disease, death rates for males were significantly higher than those for females in all five ethnic groups; however, for malignant neoplasms, death rates for males were significantly higher than for females only among Japanese. Comparing ethnic groups, standardized mortality rates were highest for Hawaiians, lowest for the three Asian groups and intermediate for Caucasians.
Age-specific mortality rates are displayed graphically in Figure 1 while their actual values and the associated confidence intervals are shown in Tables 4 through 6. The equations in the last column of each table illustrate the significant differences in mortality for various ethnic groups. For example, "H>CA>CH,F,J" denotes that the mortality rates for the Chinese (CH), Filipino (F), and Japanese (J) did not differ significantly from each other, but were significantly lower than rates for Caucasians (CA) and Hawaiians (H) and, additionally, that the death rate for Hawaiians was significantly higher than the rate for Caucasians. A look at Figure 1 suggests that, in general, ethnic variations in mortality rates were small and insignificant in the early age strata but were significantly, and some cases dramatically, different in adulthood.
All Cause Mortality Rates.--In general, for both males and females, Hawaiians had significantly higher all-cause mortality rates than at least one other ethnic group in all age strata from 14-24 to 65-74. Caucasians had the second highest death rates among the five ethnic groups; in some age strata Caucasian rates were statistically similar to those of Hawaiians while, in others, they were significantly lower than those for Hawaiians

but significantly higher than those for the three Asian groups. The Chinese and Japanese groups usually had the lowest death rates in each age strata. Table 4 provides the actual rates and the intergroup comparative equations for 1990.
Heart Disease Mortality Rates.--In general, the same pattern is seen for heart disease mortality rates, with rates highest for Hawaiians, intermediate for Caucasians, and lowest for the three Asian groups. Death rates for Hawaiians were significantly higher than all others only in the 45-65 age strata. For the 65-84 age strata, Caucasian and Hawaiian death rates are statistically similar, but both are significantly higher than rates for one or more of the three Asian groups. Table 5 provides actual rates and inter-group comparative equations.
Malignant Neoplasm MortalityRates.-- For malignant neoplasms, the Native Hawaiian mortality rates are again highest of the five groups. Caucasian rates are second highest and the death rates for the three Asian groups are significantly lower than the other two groups at several age strata. Detail is provided in Table 6.
DISCUSSION
The findings concur with those reported nationally that Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino Americans have substantially lower mortality rates than do Caucasian Americans and that Hawaiians have high cancer death rates (Gardner, 1994; LinFu, 1988; Yu and Liu, 1992). Additionally, this study found that Native Hawaiian mortality rates were generally higher than other groups for heart disease and all causes of death. These patterns were also evident in the 1980 death rate comparisons (not shown in tables). Taken to-

gether, these findings validate the variance in health status among these API groups and underscore the importance of looking to states with high proportions of API to provide estimates of mortality for specific API subgroups. Implications of these findings are discussed on several levels.
First, this study calls attention to methodological issues confronted in longitudinal and comparative health research of small ethnic groups, including small numbers in some categories for certain ethnic groups; differences in age structures of various populations; inconsistency in definitions of ethnicity and coding in numerators and denominators; and over-time changes in coding and classification of ethnicity and disease. To com-

pensate for known differences in age structure among major ethnic groups, we estimated age-standardized rates as well as age-specific rates for 11 age categories. The latter procedure exacerbated the problem of small numbers per cell, requiring us to present only mortality rates for all causes and two major disease categories, total heart diseases and all cancers. (We did not have the statistical power to demonstrate significance in ethnic differences in rates for other causes of death.) Because inconsistent definitions of ethnicity between numerators and denominators can lead to erroneous estimation in mortality levels, our choice of denominator (U.S. census vs. the Hawaii Health Survey) was crucial. The implications of our choice were consequential,

of programs that have provided special opportunities for education and land ownership for Hawaiians (Blaisdell and Mokuau, 1991). Over-time changes in the classification of disease were also a concern. Thus, this study compromised by focusing on 1980 and 1990 death rates, instead of examining the mortality trend over the century.
Second, this study demonstrates the usefulness of increased detail when discussing health status of API Americans. Aggregation of API American statistics masks the successes of some groups and problems of others. Upon closer inspection of these groups, investigators are finding that health status of Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino Americans may be better than that of Caucasians (Yu and Liu, 1994). Although this study showed few significant differences among these three Asian groups, and large differences between these Asian groups and the Native Hawaiian group, this is not to say that just analyzing Asian Americans separately from Pacific Islanders will suffice. There is growing evidence that the health status of other Asian American groups, like Koreans and South-East Asians, may be worse than that of Caucasians (Gold, 1992; Min, 1995; Ying and Hu, 1994). Unfortunately, the absolute numbers of South-East Asian and Korean residents in Hawaii were too small for our analysis.
Other studies have also found significant within-group differences when examining ethnicity. In the case of Hawaiians, an earlier study by the authors found significant death rate differences in mortality rates among full, part, and nonHawaiians, with full Hawaiians exhibiting significantly higher rates than part Hawaiians (and both full and part Hawaiians exhibiting significantly higher rates

than non-Hawaiians) for all causes of death, heart disease, and malignant neoplasms (Braun, Look et al., 1996; Braun, Yang et al., 1996). Ethnicity is also confounded by birthplace and current residency. For example, Liu and Yu (1985) found that among API dwelling in the United States mortality rates for foreignborn API are significantly higher than mortality rates for U.S.-born API. Kieffer and colleagues (1995) found that Hawaiians living in Hawaii had better birth outcomes (e.g., lower neonatal morbidity and infant mortality) than Hawaiians living on the U.S. mainland even after controlling for prenatal care and sociodemographic differences. Ethnicity is often confounded by socioeconomic status (SES) as well. While the link between low SES and poor health has been well established (Navarro, 1990; Pappas, 1994), efforts to develop standard definitions and collection mechanisms for research focused on relationships between health status and socioeconomic status is still in its infancy (Moss and Krieger, 1995). Taken together, these considerations suggest that ethnicity alone is not an ideal independent variable for health analysis. Future studies of health status are needed to test the relative impact of SES and other variables that confound ethnicity (Link and Phelan, 1996).
On the level of health care policy in Hawaii, the findings indicate that special attention be given to improving the health status of Hawaiians, whether the root cause of their poor health status is ethnicity, SES, or something else. This special attention would require working with Native Hawaiian organizations and leaders to identify successful intervention strategies and concentrating services in communities where Hawaiians reside. In fact,
