ABSTRACT: The prevalence of cigarette smoking in the United States has declined over the past few decades. However, some leveling-off in prevalence rates has been observed in recent years, and the rate for teenagers and young adults has even turned upward. This paper considers four alternative scenarios of future cigarette smoking patterns in the United States for the population 25 and over and measures the impact these different scenarios would have on excess mortality due to smoking and on the sex and age distributions of deaths. Scenarios reflecting higher levels of smoking prevalence produce considerably more deaths than scenarios tied to lower levels. As many as two and one-half million excess deaths would take place in the decade of the 2020's if a high prevalence, rather than low prevalence, assumption proves correct. Even when a constant prevalence, assumption proves correct. Even when a constant prevalence assumption is compared with a moderately-declining prevalence assumption, as many as one million excess deaths would be generated during that decade alone. Lowering smoking prevalence rates would also change the population sex ratio by reducing deaths for males more than deaths for females, and by contributing to the aging of the population. The results are interpreted in terms of the overall impact of smoking on mortality and with regard to public and private policy decisions related to cigarette smoking.

Although tobacco was a major agricultural crop in the United States from the earliest times in the country's development, users of tobacco in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were more likely to chew it or smoke it in cigars than to smoke it in cigarettes, Those who were cigarette smokers were most apt to roll their own, since manufactured cigarettes had not yet become widespread. The production of manufactured cigarettes in the United States began to climb sharply early in the twentieth century and reached a peak in the middle of this century (U.S. Public Health Service, 1956).
The cigarette smoking prevalence rate for men reached 54 per cent by the

early 1950's and has since declined steadily to about 25 per cent. For some cohorts of men, as many as 66 per cent of them smoked cigarettes when they attained young adulthood. The cigarette smoking prevalence rate for women, who tended to take up smoking much later than did men, reached well over 30 per cent by the mid-1960's and has likewise fallen to about 25 per cent. For some cohorts of women, the rate reached 44 per cent by young adulthood (Cowell and Hirst, 1980; National Cancer Institute 1991; National Center for Health Statistics, 1994). The trends in cigarette smoking prevalence by age since 1955 are shown in Figure 1 for men and Figure 2 for women.

The apparent decline in cigarette smoking in recent decades is generally attributed to admonitions from the Surgeon General about the health hazards of smoking and the subsequent strong campaigns to get smokers to quit. While these campaigns seem to have been very successful, studies done within the past few years have recorded a rise in the smoking habits of teenagers (CDC, 1995; Nelson et al., 1995) and plateaus in the smoking prevalence of adult men and women (CDC, 1994). These changes are reflected in Figures 1 and 2, where the general decline in smoking as well as the more recent upturns and age- and sex-variations can be observed.
Research done by us and others has strengthened the conclusion that cigarette smoking, especially heavy smoking, leads to a high risk of premature death (Nam, Rogers, and Hummer, 1994; Doll et al., 1994). Based on our analysis of data for the 1986 period, among persons reaching age 25, those who never smoked lived 18 years longer than those who were continuing heavy smokers. Quitters and those who smoked lightly had intermediate ages at death. Even when demographic, socioeconomic, and other health risk factors are introduced into the analysis, the fatal consequences of smoking persist. With those factors controlled, the odds ratio of dying during the 1985-87 period was over twice as great for continuing heavy smokers as for never smokers and nearly four times as great for late quitters as for never smokers (Hummer, Rogers, and Nam, 1995).
What does this portend for the future? What are likely to be the mortality consequences of future smoking

patterns? In this paper, we estimate the long-run outcomes by assuming four different future smoking scenarios and calculating the number of deaths that would result--and consequent sex and age patterns of death--by decennial years up to 2050.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The four smoking scenarios are labeled high, upper medium, lower medium, and low, and are based on varying assumptions about future trends in smoking prevalence specific to sex and age categories for persons 25 and over. The assumptions are:
High.-- Rates increase to 1983 agesex-specific levels by 2000 and remain at that level until 2050. This assumption reflects the recent increases in smoking prevalence rates among young people. Since 1983 levels are only moderately higher than levels of recent years (see Figures 1 and 2), this is a conservatively high assumption.
Upper medium.-- Age-sex-specific rates remain at 1992 levels until 2050. This is essentially a constant assumption, which reflects recent leveling off of adult prevalence rates and a position that one-fourth of the adult population will remain smokers regardless of efforts to have them quit. The constant levels can be used as a base against which to measure the effects of the other three assumptions.
Lower medium. --Age-sex-specific rates of decline between 1983 and 1992 are extrapolated to 2050. This assumption is predicated on the notion that recent upturns in smoking prevalence are temporary departures from a trend, and that further reductions in smoking prevalence are possible. The decline

experienced in the 1983-92 period was moderate and gradual, so that continuation of that level of decline will result in a substantial minority of remaining smokers by the year 2050.
Low. --Age-sex-specific rates fall linearly to zero by 2020 and remain at that level. This assumption is based on the possibility that cigarette smoking can be completely eliminated within the next quarter of a century and emerge again. Although probably not highly realistic, this assumption can also be used as a base against which to measure the other three levels of smoking patterns.
Smoking prevalence rates distinguish between those who currently smoke and those who do not. We further divided these categories by differentiating the prevalence rate between current light smokers (less than a pack a day) and current heavy smokers (a pack or more per day), and the nonprevalence rate between never smokers and quitters (with quitters further differentiated according to how long since they quit). This last distinction was found in our research to be critically related to mortality risks. The subcategories were estimated by assuming that the relative distribution of them within each age-sex group in the 1985-97 NHIS surveys remained constant over time.
The result of the several assumptions was a set of tables (not presented here) showing by sex, age, decennial year, and smoking-prevalence scenario, the percentage distribution of persons by smoking status. The numbers related to each percentage (shown in Table 1) were derived by multiplying the percentages by the corresponding medium-assumption population pro-

jections by age and sex for each year according to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (Day, 1993). The associated number of deaths expected in each cell was determined by multiplying the population numbers by the age-sexsmoking status-specific mortality rates generated from the 1985-87 study (Hummer, Rogers, and Nam, 1995). These rates were assumed to remain constant over time. Consequently, the only variables in this analysis are the alternative temporal smoking scenarios and the changing population size by age and sex.
Clearly, this model is oversimplified for projecting deaths related to smoking in the future. We do not allow for variations in several of the conditions we specify, and we do not take into account such variables as causes of death, the interactions among variables, and possible changes in the nature of smoking habits (such as increasing or decreasing the volume of smoking or altered patterns of inhaling). We also do not allow for lag times between smoking and mortality. Nevertheless, our results should give a good preliminary indication of the mortality consequences of alternative smoking trends. We intend to elaborate the model at a later time and to see if the results change significantly.
RESULTS
This paper examines mortality between 1990 and the middle of the next century in terms of differences generated by varying patterns of cigarette smoking. We analyze the impacts of four alternative smoking trend scenarios on: (1) the number of expected excess deaths due to variations in

cigarette smoking, (2) the extent of excess male mortality due to such variations, and (3) differences in the age distribution of deaths resulting from varying smoking patterns.
Previous studies have determined the total number of deaths attributed to cigarette smoking (Peto et al., 1992; National Center for Health Statistics, 1994; Bartecchi et al., 1995; Thun et al., 1995). Most such estimates for the United States in recent years put the number above 400,000.
The objective of our analysis is not to recreate such an estimate, but rather to discover how many deaths would take place under different smoking regimes. Differences in the number of deaths for the several smoking scenarios provide estimates of the effect of varying assumed smoking trends in the population. Thus, in Table 2, we estimate differences in the number of deaths as a consequence of the U.S. adult population following the smoking trend implied by the High assumption as opposed to the Low assumption and as implied by the Upper Medium assumption versus the Low Medium assumption.
Using the High/Low comparison, we find an excess of roughly 85,000 deaths in the year 2000 if the High, as opposed to Low, scenario takes place. By the year 2020, the annual discrepancy reaches almost 240,000 deaths; by the year 2050, the single-year disparity approaches 500,000 deaths. The High and Low assumptions represent extremes in that the High assumes some rise from the present in smoking prevalence while the Low assumes rapid reduction in smoking prevalence to a zero point by 2020. We, therefore, introduced a much more conservative

comparison--that of the Upper Medium versus Lower Medium assumptions. This comparison gives the answer to the question of how many excess deaths there would be if specific smoking rates remained constant as opposed to declining at a modest rate. In this case, 24,000 more deaths would take place in the year 2000 if the rates stayed constant, and this disparity would rise to almost 100,000 more deaths annually by 2020 and about 168,000 annually by 2050.
Since the previous estimates are for individual years only, we also estimated the excess number of deaths each decade according to each comparison of assumptions (Table 3). Given the High/Low comparison, about three-quarters of a million excess deaths would occur during the first decade of the next century if the High assumption was met, and this number would increase to nearly four million by the decade of the 2040's. Comparing the Upper Medium and Lower Medium assumptions, about 428,000 excess deaths would take place in thefirst decade of the next century if the Upper Medium assumption held up, and this number would rise to over one and one-half million by the decade of the 2040's.
What are some of the demographic impacts of the variations in deaths associated with each smoking scenario? Because females live longer than males, there are proportionately more females who die at the older ages. Thus, we focus here on the change in the sex ratio rather than the sex ratios themselves. Our aim is to determine whether smoking contributes to the masculinization or feminization of death at different ages. Table 4 shows

comparison, but the magnitude of reductions are lower. On balance, declines in smoking would have the effect of reducing deaths to males more than deaths to females.
The age distribution of deaths is likewise affected by the course of smoking prevalence. Apart from the fact that the adult population will age more rapidly in the future because of basic demographic changes, lowering of smoking prevalence will accelerate that population-aging process by shifting ages at death to later points inthe

life cycle (Table 5). This effect isexpected to be more pronounced for men than women.
The fact that patterns of sex ratios and agedistributions both change with variations in smoking patterns indicate that the demographic and smoking variables are synergistically related.
CONCLUSIONS
Cigarette smoking has been definitely linked to a higher risk of premature death, and this risk is greatest for

those individuals who continue to smoke heavily and those who stopped smoking but only after they presumably had incurred a serious illness. The greater the prevalence of cigarette smoking in the future, the greater will be the expected number of deaths in the population which occur prematurely. In this paper, we estimated the number of such excess deaths for the adult population in future years using four scenarios of future trends in smoking prevalence within categories of sex and age. We also determined the extent to which the sex-age composition of the adult population would be affected by the alternative smoking scenarios.
We find that the number of excess deaths generated by comparing scenarios representing higher and lower levels of smoking prevalence are substantial. To illustrate, when we compare the scenario that allows for a slight rise in current smoking prevalence with the scenario that assumes a decline in prevalence to a zero point by the year 2020, we find a difference of about 85,000 deaths in the year 2000, and the excess number rises to a quarter of a million deaths in the year 2020, and to one-half million in the year 2050. This scenario translates into three-quarters of a million excess deaths during the first decade of the next century, two and onehalf million excess deaths in the decade of the 2020's and almost 4 million excess deaths in the decade of the 2040's.
One might question the choice of comparisons since they are based on extreme, although possible, assumptions. We thus shifted our comparisons to a more conservative basis by comparing the two medium smoking-prevalence assumptions--one that regards

smoking prevalence as remaining constant and one that allows for a continuing modest decline in smoking rates. Based on this set of comparisons, we find a difference of over 24,000 deaths in the year 2000, and the excess number rises to almost 100,000 by 2020 and to almost 168,000 by 2050. Over a decade, this would mean about 428,000 excess deaths in 2000-09 if prevalence rates do not continue their decline, and this number would increase to over 1.1 million excess deaths in the decade of the 2020's and over 1.6 million excess deaths in the decade of the 2040's.
The effects of the varying smoking scenarios on the sex and age composition of the adult deaths is less dramatic, but significant. Lower smoking prevalence rates would change sex ratios in the population by reducing male deaths more than female deaths at each age. It would also shift deaths from younger to older adult ages, thereby contributing further to the aging of the population that is already produced by basic population dynamics.
The projection model developed here is based on the Census Bureau's medium assumption and overlooks a range of potentially complicating variables that could alter the results we have obtained. These variables encompass other changing population characteristics that differentiate smoking habits, as well as alterations in the types of cigarette smoking and in the frequency and intensity of smoking. We have distributed the smoking status populations according to the Census Bureau's projections, and then determined the resulting mortality rates.
An alternative approach to applying the derived mortality rates to the

Census population projections would have been to substitute our mortality assumptions for the ones used by the Census Bureau in their projections, and then see how future population age and sex composition would be affected. This substitution may result in somewhat different numbers of estimated deaths by smoking category.
Another option would be to use multistate analysis to project separately each smoking status subpopulation. The multistate approach would begin with the population distributed by smoking status and provide mortality rates by status, but allow individuals to either stay in one status or to move to other statuses. This alternate approach, while potentially yielding less accurate population counts, would increase the effects of smoking on mortality by cumulating high mortality risks on a concentrated subpopulation of smokers and thereby statistically increase mortality among males, leading to a greater gender gap, and mortality at the younger ages, further retarding the aging of the population. Unfortunately, the multistate approach requires smoking status transitions and explicit assumptions about migration, fertility, and smoking status distributions below age 25.
We believe that the variables accounted for in our model--differing smoking prevalence rates by sex and age, distinctions among current and former smokers, and reasonable population projections by sex and age-- lead to fairly robust estimates of persons by smoking status in future years. Elaboration of the model would give the estimates greater specificity, but it is unlikely that it would alter them greatly. Thus, our findings can be used

as general estimates of the effects of smoking on future age and sex distributions of deaths and on overall mortality, and as baseline numbers for future estimates of the effects of smoking using different approaches, including the multistate approach.
What implications do these findings have for understanding the overall impact of cigarette smoking on mortality? It is clear that lower levels of cigarette smoking in a population, have the effect of sharply reducing the number of "excess deaths" that would obtain if higher levels of smoking were in force. Because of the widespread nature of cigarette smoking, even allowing for declines in recent decades, the numbers of smokers in the United States are substantial, and any reduction in the smoking prevalence rate would lead to many fewer deaths at a younger given age. The type of projected future estimation of smoking patterns an their mortality consequences presented here adds to the evidence that smoking is a major component of the national mortality picture for adults.
What implications do these findings have for public and private policy decisions related to cigarette smoking? The emphasis placed on smoking prevention by public health agencies is clearly justified by this and other research. People who have never smoked have the lowest mortality risks in the population. Quitting smoking is beneficial for survival prospects, although it may not be beneficial if a smoker quits only after a serious illness is incurred. For those who cannot quit smoking, a significant reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked would serve to lessen mortality risks. The net result of efforts to bring about these shifts will
