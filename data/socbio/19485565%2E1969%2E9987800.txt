With the prodigious growth of medical genetics during the past several decades, numerous new "subspecialties" have evolved, such as molecular genetics, dermatoglyphics, immunogenetics, and pharmacogenetics; undoubtedly, many more will appear. Thus, a human geneticist investigating a particular genetic trait or disease in one or more kindreds has a potential wealth of highly specialized genetic consultants available to him. However, the obvious problem with which he is immediately confronted is how to locate these specialists, or more precisely, "Who is doing what and where?" Because of this dilemma, we decided to formulate a world-wide medical genetics information source, listing the units, their directors, and their available special services. We therefore compiled an International Directory of Genetic Services, which was published under the auspices of The National Foundation in May, 1968.
Reference sources for the Directory included the following: (1) the roster of the American Society of Human Genetics;

(2) the rosters of certain genetic societies in Europe and Asia; (3) previous publications of lists of genetic clinics in the United States; (4) information from the Human Genetics Units of the World Health Organization; (5) questionnaires which were completed at the Third International Congress of Human Genetics held in Chicago in September, 1966; (6) the list of Birth Defects Centers of The National Foundation; (7) catalogues of all medical schools indicating any type of identification with medical genetics; and (8) correspondence with colleagues throughout the world. Questionnaires, with space allocated for recording identifying information, services offered, and other units known to them in their own area or nearby countries, were sent to these geneticists and to the directors of genetics units.
As available services were ascertained, an extensive list of genetic services was drawn up. This list was later culled to incorporate only major headings (Table 1). Correspondence following publication of the Directory has indicated a need to include several

additional services in the next edition. The major objective of the International
Directory of Genetic Services is to expedite the dissemination and exchange of epidemiologic, medical-genetic, socioeconomic, and genealogic information pertaining to hereditary disorders. For example, medical-genetic information involving newly-described hereditary syndromes can often be elucidated through the accumulation of medical data

and England, and others in Ohio, Illinois, Nebraska, and California, an investigator might decide that the accumulation of genetic data is an insurmountable problem. However, through use of the Directory, he may correspond with geneticists from the several locations and through the exchange of information regarding these relatives, he might add significantly to scientific knowledge from an in-depth investigation.

on the greatest number of ascertainable family members. Knowledge of the full spectrum of clinical variations in a particular hereditary syndrome could provide insight into its pathogenesis and could aid in its classification. However, because of extensive population mobility and migration, particularly in Western culture, it is not always possible for one investigator to accumulate complete family data. For instance, if a proband resides in New York and some of his relatives live in Germany, Denmark,

correspondence has indicated that this objective is now being realized; hopefully, it will come to fruition in many important genetic studies. Sharing of genetic information not only advances scientific knowledge among the units involved, but also could contribute to humanitarian needs through provision of genetic counseling services.
As an illustration of the above points, we recently had an opportunity to assist a colleague with a family investigation. Specifically, we received a telephone call from a
