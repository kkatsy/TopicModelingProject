ABSTRACT: Data from the 1988 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey is employed to determine the existence of a relationship between the amount of education a woman has and her intent to cease childbearing. The findings are that with increasing levels of education, a female's desire to cease reproduction also increases. However, this relationship is obscured if parity is not controlled.

In less developed countries, increasing female education is acknowledged to be a major antecedent to fertility decline. However, in many of these countries, there has been evidence of considerable increases in levels of female education without the expected fertility decreases. Ghana, one such country, has experienced a substantial advance in female education in the three decades since independence with no significant decrease in fertility. The proportion of females who have ever attended school increased from 21 per cent in 1960 to 62 per cent in 1984. Yet, the first comprehensive national fertility data, the 1979 Ghana Fertility Survey, estimated the total fertility rate (TFR) of 15-44 year old women at 6.30 for the 1975-79 period; the 1988 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey places the TFR at 6.11 for the 1985-88 period (Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, 1989).
The lack of any significant fertility decline also continues to characterize many other sub-Saharan African countries. Numerous linkages between female education and fertility have been

documented. Increasing female education has been shown to have diametrically opposing effects on fertility. More emphasis has been placed--in terms of documentation--on the suppressor effect of education on fertility. On the other hand, there is evidence of an inducing effect of education on fertility, for example, when increasing levels of education reduce sterility and improve health.
For high fertility countries, development and an incipient emergence from poverty are critically dependent on the lessening of high fertility. Any hope for a reduction in fertility is in turn predicated on an increasing proportion of women (or, more precisely, families) who want no more children. The logic underlying the existence of an inverse relationship between levels of female education and fertility (see, for example, Caldwell, 1980) also suggests that more education for females should be positively related to a desire to cease childbearing. If a distinct association exists between level of education and reproductive cessation then the argument for promoting increased female

education persists, even in the face of a lack of aggregate fertility decline.
Earlier researchers have suggested that the early stages of fertility decline are associated with changes in family size ambitions (Knodel, 1977; Knodel and van de Walle, 1979). BourgeoisPichat (1967) suggested that fertility decline in nonindustrial countries is associated with a decrease in the number of children women had from a six- to a two-child norm. Others (e.g., Namboodiri, 1972) stress the notion of a sequential fertility decision-making process and the need for parity-specific analytical consideration.
Analysts of the fertility of less developed countries (LDC's) have begun to concede that the lack of a fertility response to the family planning push by people in LDC's is essentially a result of a desire to have large families. Caldwell and Caldwell (1990) suggest that fertility in these countries is a rational result of the social, economic, and cultural conditions prevailing. Westoff (1988) shows that, contrary to previous beliefs of the existence of a substantial KAP-gap, the unmet need for contraception is rather small. The implication is that fertility limitation remains an uninteresting prospect for these people. At the same time, Caldwell and Caldwell (1990) outline factors which will almost definitely lead to a reduction of fertility. While the consensus seems to be that sub-Saharan Africa has not experienced any fertility decline, Oheneba-Sakyi (1989) indicates that there is evidence of very recent changes in fertility behavior in Ghana.
One way to anticipate what the future holds in terms of a fertility decline is to ask women what their future in-

tentions regarding fertility are. As indicated earlier, female education is regarded as a concomitant of fertility decline. This study investigates the relationship between female education and the intention not to have an ensuing child. The premise here is that the data will provide evidence of higher levels of schooling inducing higher reproductive cessation intentions.
Further, by using a question that evokes a parity-specific response, another contribution of this study is to evaluate the parity-specific nature of the education-fertility-intentions link. If it can be ascertained that an unambiguous relationship exists between female education and the fertility intention, after controlling for parity, even in the face of an unclear relationship without parity-specific control, then a stronger argument for promoting increases in female education exists. Methodologically, such a finding would also stress the necessity of parity specificity in the analysis of fertility or intentions.
Finally, this study endeavors to show that contrary to presumptions that fertility control is uninteresting to people in sub-Saharan Africa, more educated females do have more interest in ceasing reproduction than their uneducated, or less educated, counterparts. Deriving from this information then would be a policy prescription that advocates a more vigorous promotion of female education.
EDUCATION AND FERTILITY: AN AMBIGUOUS LINK?
The level of female education is generally perceived to be inversely related to fertility. However, it is widely

acknowledged that increasing female education in developing countries influences certain proximate determinants (e.g., health, and breastfeeding), which may in turn act to raise fertility. The inverse relationship usually found is believed to be a result of a change in perception of the costs and benefits of childbearing; these operate through affected demand, supply, and regulation costs of childbearing (Cochrane, 1979; Caldwell, 1980; Blake and Del Pinal, 1982; Cochrane, 1983).
Increasing levels of female education have also been recognized to reduce overall fertility in traditionally resistant areas of high fertility. Fargues (1989) argues that fertility in the Moslem world has fallen partly because of the erosion of education inequalities between sexes. Aside from demographic (through age at marriage) and economic (cost versus benefits) influences, psychological factors stemming from increased education help lower fertility by projecting women into the world outside their family circle. Retherford and Ogawa (1976) state that increases in female education account for a substantial fraction (about 25 per cent) of the fertility drop in Korea between 1960 and 1970.

excluded in an attempt to ensure that women in the analysis are at least past the age of primary school completion and are at least eligible, with respect to age, to have some secondary education.
In addition to the age restriction, infecund women are dropped from the study since their intentions are not relevant to the study. After these omissions, 2,490 women remain. These women are presented in three educational categories: no education, some primary education, and at least some secondary education.
The dependent variable in the study is dichotomous in nature; the definite intention not to have another child is coded one, while all other intentions or plans for having more children (women who want more, and those who are undecided or unsure) are coded zero. The most restrictive definition of a negative intent to continue childbearing is used in order to derive a conservative assessment of the education/intentions link. The question in the survey essentially asked women whether they would like to have a/another child. Possible responses were; have another, no more, cannot get pregnant, and undecided or do not know.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data used in the study came from the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, a nationally representative sample survey of 4,488 women aged 15-49 and a subsample of 943 husbands. The survey was carried out between February and June, 1988. For the purpose of the present study, the analysis is restricted to the women aged 20-49. Women under age 20 are

RESULTS
A description of the women in the study is given in Table 1. The mean number of years of schooling for women with some primary schooling is 7.7 years, whereas it is 11.8 years for women with at least some secondary education. The uneducated women have a mean age of 32.8 years and, as expected, are slightly older than the women with some primary education

tentions, introducing parity into the equation reveals otherwise. There is a general trend of a higher level of desired stoppage of childbearing with increasing education at all parities above parity one.
Less than half of the uneducated women at each parity definitely want no more children at all parities prior to

parity six. For women with only some primary schooling, it is only at parity five that half desire no more children; and for secondary educated women, this occurs at parity four.
The results of a logistic regression are presented in Table 5 to summarize the effects of education on the cessation intention, controlling for parity.

The dependent variable is dichotomous, with women who definitely want no more coded "one," and women in all other categories coded "zero." As in the interpretation of logistic regressions (Morgan and Teachman, 1988; DeMaris, 1990), the dependent variable is the logarithm of the odds of definitely not wanting another child. The independent variable, education, has three categories with the omitted category being the uneducated women. The number of living children is introduced as a control variable. The coefficient for each of the education categories (e.g., secondary schooling) can then be interpreted as the magnitude of increase/decrease to the logarithm of the odds of not wanting another child, of being in the particular educational category (having secondary schooling) relative to the omitted category (no schooling), holding other variables (e.g., parity) constant.
The findings reinforce those in Table 4. Without controlling for parity, level of schooling does not significantly alter the log odds of cessation intentions. After controlling for parity, however, increasing education is significant in raising the log odds of the

intention to cease childbearing. Controlling for parity, primary schooling increases the log odds of the intention to have no more children by a magnitude of 0.74 relative to uneducated women; having at least a secondary education raises the log odds to 1.49 relative to the uneducated.
DISCUSSION
It is important to recognize the necessity for parity-specific control in fertility analysis. Without controlling for parity here, no relationship was observed between fertility and the cessation intention. However, once parity was introduced a clear relationship emerged.
The results of this study counter claims that people in sub-Saharan Africa are not interested in fertility limitation. On the contrary, educated women obviously are interested. A problem may exist, though, in the ability to translate this intention into reality. This finding implies that there is an urgent need for more research into why, even though the intention exists, there is no result in terms of decreased fertility. Perhaps existing patriarchal
