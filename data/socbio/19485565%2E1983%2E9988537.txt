ABSTRACT: Methods for assessing the gain of life expectancy by reducing the risks of death are examined. Depending on the method used, overestimation and underestimation of life expectancy may occur. Although the gain in life expectancy is not a linear function of the per cent reduction in mortality, a linear approximation may be used when the mortality rate is low. When themortality rate ishigh, linear approximations tend to overestimate theyears gained. A method using the parameter H(i) developed byKeyfitz (1977) isadequate for low mortality rates such as with neoplasms. However, when mortality rates are high, as they are for cardiovascular-renal diseases (CVD), Keyfitz's method tends to underestimate the gain in life expectancy. For CVD, Keyfitz's estimation is adequate below the 20 per cent reduction range. The magnitude of overestimation and underestimation are numerically evaluated based onthe 1964 United States male mortality statistics.

In order to compare our results with those of Keyfitz (1977), the methods in the previous section have been applied to the United States male mortality statistics for 1964. Figure 1 gives the added years of life at birth associated with a 100 IT per cent reduction in CVD, neoplasms, and MVA. These calculations were carried out using Equation (1), the exact expression for

tion is grossly inadequate for CVD. For example, in a 10 per cent reduction of CVD, the linear approximation overestimates the gain in expectation of life by approximately 90 per cent. In a 30 per cent reduction of CVD there is an overestimation of nearly 70 per cent. Conversely, the estimates based on the parameter i/W are adequate within a 20 per cent reduction range for CVD and the entire reduction range for neoplasms and MVA.
Figure 2 further compares these three approaches for CVD. The estimate using the parameter H(' is analogous to taking a tangent at a very small per cent reduction of CVD. It can be linearly extrapolated up to about a 20 per cent re-

duction level. Beyond this level Keyfitz's method would lead to an underestimation.
Calculations according to Equation (1) are more tedious when compared to the approximation in Equation (2). The same is true for calculations of H® values. The linear approximation is more convenient for computation but gives appropriate results only if one is accumulating small reductions in each of the competing causes or only for causes which make a small contribution to the total mortality.

life expectancy associated with a partial reduction of certain causes of death can be approximated by a convenient linear function when the mortality rate is as small as it is for neoplasms, the second leading cause of death today in the United States. For CVD, the first leading cause of death, this linear approximation tends to overestimate the added years of life. Consequently, the linear approximation should not be used in this type of calculation for public health policy analysis. While estimates based on a convenient parameter developed by Keyfitz are adequate within a 20 per cent reduction range for CVD, they tend to overestimate beyond this range. The "exact method" should especially

be used for CVD, in view of the continuing downward trend in diseases of the heart, combined with the need to examine the effect of the downward trend for long periods of time.
A practical method to approximate the exact line for partial elimination on the cause of death when the mortality rate is high is to calculate the gain in life expectation at a 50 per cent elimination and a 100per cent elimination. Connecting these two points, and the 50 per cent point with the origin, gives a good estimation for the curve. This method gives a reasonable approximation for CVD.
When the appropriate formula is used, it should also be noted that the basic assumption of independence among
