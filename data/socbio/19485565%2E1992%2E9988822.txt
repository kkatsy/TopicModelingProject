ABSTRACT:Using 1979-87 Hawaii vital record data on single live births, this study compares by nativity status of the mother the maternal characteristics and pregnancy outcomes of resident Filipino women. Among ethnic minorities in the United States, the pregnancy outcomes of U.S.-born mothers have been reported to compare unfavorably to their foreign-born counterparts. In this study, unequivocally preferential pregnancy outcome indicators were not observed for foreign-born women. Contrary to expectations, a significant, but modest, increase in therisk of preterm delivery was found for infants of Philippines-born mothers, along with a less favorable mean birth weight and gestational age. As a growing minority population in the United States, the atypical determinants and patterns of pregnancy outcome in this population warrants further investigation.

Investigations of factors related to pregnancy outcome have infrequently considered the role of maternal nativity status. Nevertheless, rates of low birth weight, intrauterine growth, and infant mortality have been observed to vary between foreign-born and nativeborn mothers of the same ethnic group. In the United States, the pregnancy outcomes of black and Hispanic U.S.-born mothers have been reported to compare unfavorably to their foreign-born counterparts (Cabral, 1990; Kleinman, 1991; Valanis, 1979a, 19796; Ventura, 1985; Williams, 1986) and the better pregnancy outcomes of foreign-born compared to U.S.-born minority populations in the United States have been cited as an indication that considerable further reduction in ethnic disparities in pregnancy outcomes is possible (Kleinman, 1991).

Among Asian ethnic groups in the United States, the extent to which disparities in pregnancy outcomes exist among women of native versus foreign nativity has yet to be fully explored. In the State of Hawaii, births to Filipino mothers comprised approximately 16.5 per cent of the total single live births to resident mothers during the period 1979 to 1987. Among the prominent ethnic groups in this multi-ethnic environment, infants of Filipino mothers demonstrated one of the highest percentages of low birth weight (8.8 per cent). The factors underlying this differential in birth weight have not been completely identified, and a paucity of information is available regarding the maternal sociodemographic and prenatal care utilization characteristics of U.S.-born Filipinos. Further, little is known regarding the potential

than 18 years of age and single and less likely to be 35 years of age or older. High educational attainment, defined as more than a high school education for adults and two years above grade level for adolescents, was found for more than one-half of the Philippinesborn mothers. Philippines-born mothers demonstrated higher percentages of both low and high educational attainment, indicating a greater variation in educational levels than Hawaii-born mothers.
Table 2 presents pregnancy outcome indicators by nativity status. No significant differences in preterm, low birth weight, and small for gestational age percentages were observed between the two nativity status groups. The mean birth weight and gestational age of infants of Philippines-born mothers were significantly lower than those of Hawaii-born mothers. However, the actual difference in these measures between the two groups was modest. The infant and neonatal mor-

tality rates of infants of Philippinesborn mothers were lower than those of Hawaii-born mothers, but the between-group difference in these indicators was not significant.
Birth weight distributions and birthweight-specific neonatal mortality rates are displayed for each nativity group in Figure 1. The birth weight distributions of the two groups were nearly identical with only a slight shift toward higher values notable for the Hawaii-born distribution. Modestly improved birth-weight-specific neonatal mortality rates were apparent for the Philippines-born group in the 2,500 to 3,500 gram range.
The results of the logistic regression analyses of maternal characteristics on low birth weight and preterm delivery are provided in Table 3. Elevated risks of low birth weight were found for single marital status, primiparity at all ages, parity 1-4 for women 30 years or greater, and low educational attainment. No difference in low birth

weight risk was found for nativity status. Adequate prenatal care reduced the risk of low birth weight and preterm delivery. However, after taking into account the maternal factors under study, a higher risk of preterm birth was found for the infants of Philippines-born mothers. Births to unmarried mothers, to mothers less than 18years of age, and to primiparas 30 years of age or more also demonstrated higher risks of preterm birth.
DISCUSSION
Previous investigations of the relationship of nativity status to pregnancy outcome in the United States have

reported more favorable outcomes among foreign-born women (Cabral, 1990; Kleinman, 1991; Valanis, 1979a, 19796; Ventura, 1985; Williams, 1986). Several interpretations for these findings have been offered. Underreporting of mortality due to departure from the United States prior to an infant's death has been suggested as a potential explanation for lower postneonatal mortality rates of infants of foreign-born mothers (Kleinman, 1991). Variations in socioeconomic status and positive health behaviors have also been proposed as factors that underlie foreign nativity status advantages in pregnancy outcome (Valanis, 1979a). It has further been suggested

Vol. 39, No. 3-4

that individuals who elect to immigrate may be physically and emotionally healthier, although this potential benefit may be offset by the trauma of relocation into a new environment and culture with a distinctive health care system (Kleinman, 1979).Finally,socioeconomic deprivation, inadequate social support networks, and cultural isolation in subsequent generations may inhibit the maintenance of pregnancy outcome levels found among new immigrants.
In this study of births to Filipino mothers in Hawaii, unequivocally preferential pregnancy outcome indicators were not observed for foreign-born women. Contrary to expectations, a significant increase in the risk of preterm delivery for infants of Philippinesborn mothers was found after controlling for maternal and prenatal care factors (Table 3). This group alsodemonstrated a less favorable mean birth weight and gestational age. Infant mortality indicators were not significantly higher for infants of Hawaii-born mothers. These findings are in contrast to those that were hypothesized, based on previous reports of markedly more favorable pregnancy outcomes to foreign-born mothers. Two possible approaches to these results emerge. First, why were the pregnancy outcomes of Hawaii-born mothers not worse, particularly given the greater proportion of high risk maternal characteristics observed in this group? Alternatively, why were the pregnancy outcomes of Philippines-born mothers not better?
Investigations of pregnancy outcome in the Philippines have reported mean birth weight and gestational age values of approximately 3,010 grams

and 39.0 weeks, respectively (Adair, 1988, 1989; Barnes, 1991). The mean gestational age of Filipino births in Hawaii is in keeping with those findings from the Philippines. However, these data suggest that Filipino infants born in Hawaii, as compared to the Philippines, are on the average over 100 grams heavier. While higher levels of teenaged and single marital status pregnancies are notable among Hawaii-born mothers, these risk factors may, in part, be offset by the availability of well-established community support mechanisms, prenatal and postnatal care services, and nutritional-related education and practices.
Among Philippines-born mothers, a notable proportion (approximately 22 per cent) indicated a father associated with the military. It is unclear whether the proposed healthier status of selfselected immigrants also applies to U.S.-military-related immigrants. Association with the military does provide access to a health care system. However, social support networks may be more difficult to establish and maintain due the frequency of relocation. The large proportion (31 per cent) of births to single mothers in the Hawaiiborn group, where information was not available on the father, precluded further analysis of this factor.
The environment and multi-ethnic population of Hawaii is unique and Filipinos are but one of many ethnic groups in a population that lacks a clearly predominant ethnic majority. The vast majority of Filipino immigrations to Hawaii during the last quarter century were facilitated by the family unification provisions of the U.S.Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (East-West Center, 1985; Nordyke,
