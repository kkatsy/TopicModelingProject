ABSTRACT:For the present study three castes representing three socioeconomic levels have been selected from Andhra Pradesh, South India. Members of the wealthier castes married consanguineously more frequently than did the members of the lower-ranking castes. The consanguineous unions among all the castes are found to be more fertile than are nonconsanguineous unions. Indeed, fertility increases with degree of relationship of the spouses. Number of pregnancies and live births are significantly (P = 0.01) higher among consanguineous unions (among all the castes). However, the difference in the number of surviving offspring between consanguineous and nonconsanguineous unions is not significant among the wealthier castes. This suggests that child mortality is higher among the offspring of consanguineous unions in spite of their greater wealth.

higher frequency of consanguineous marriages (47.20 per cent) than the Nellore Taluk (44.31 per cent) which is represented by Kodur village in this study. The same trend is observed even in the case of individual castes in their relative distribution of marriages in the two taluks.
If we consider the frequency of related marriages without resorting to regional variation, the Devanga rank highest with 48.26 per cent followed by the Desuri Kapu (47.46 per cent) and the Mala (40.63 per cent). Higher castes like the Desuri, Kapu, and the Devanga have higher frequencies of consanguineous marriages than the untouchable lower caste, the Mala, because highercaste people are more prone to marry among relatives so that they can avoid splitting their moveable and immoveable properties through dowry or bride price. That is also one of the reasons for having more extended families among the Desuri Kapu (36.82 per cent) and the Devanga (22.62 per cent) than among the Mala (19.29 per cent). The extended family is found to be most prevalent among the Desuri Kapu which is the politically, economically, and socially dominant agricultural caste among the three (Reddy, 1981).
Out of the total marriages (2,524), 18.98 per cent are between uncle (MB) and nieces (ZD), 21.79 per cent are between first cousins (FC), and 4.99 per cent are among cousins beyond first cousins (BFC). Uncle-niece marriages are found to be slightly higher in Nellore Taluk (19.33 per cent) than in Sullerpet Taluk (18.63 per cent) whereas cousin marriages are more frequent in Sullerpet Taluk (FC = 23.52 per cent; BFC = 5.05 per cent) than in Nellore Taluk (FC = 20.05 per cent; BFC = 4.93 per cent). The Desuri Kapu

caste exhibits a higher proportion of uncle-niece marriages (22.46 per cent) than the Devanga (17.78 per cent) and the Mala (16.01 per cent), while in the latter two castes first-cousin marriage (D = 24.59 per cent; M = 21.61 per cent) predominate. This is true in both regions.
First-cousin marriages occur more frequently than uncle-niece and distantcousin (beyond first cousin) marriages in the sample population. This trend is not altered even across regions and castes except in respect to the Desuri Kapu, where there is a higher prevalence of uncle-niece marriages than other types. Members of Desuri Kapu, being a landowning community, try to live in extended families irrespective of the sex of their siblings, thus leading to 48.07 per cent of their extended families being brother-sister-centered extended families (Reddy, 1981). In this type of family, the maternal uncle waits for his sister's daughter to come of age and marries her to keep the family's assets together over generations. Where sister's daughter (ZD) marriage is practiced over generations, sister's daughter will be the same as mother's brother's daughter (MBD), i.e., ZD = MBD. In such cases of ambiguity, the relationship of ego to his nearest blood relative (sister's daughter) is considered, and the spouse is treated as ZD although in relationship she is also his MBD. I have treated such types as ZD (uncle-niece) marriages in this study.
EFFECTS OF INBREEDING ON FERTILITY
Studies in the United States (Eaton and Mayer, 1954; Pearson, 1902; Fisher, 1949), in Europe (Darwin, 1875; Darlington, 1960; Book, 1956), in South America (Freire-Maia and Azevedo,

1971), in Japan (Schull et al., 1970; Schull and Neel, 1972; Yamamoto et al., 1972; Schull, 1973), in India (Reid, 1973; Mukherjee et al., 1974; Basu, 1975; Ramesh, 1979), and in FrenchCanadian (Philippe, 1974) populations have revealed higher fertility rates among consanguineously related married couples than among nonconsanguineous couples.
Lower fertility rates among nonconsanguineous couples have been noted in an Italian population (Contario, 1969), in an urban population of southern Brazil (Marcallo et al., 1964), and in a Goyigama caste population in rural Sri Lanka (Reid, 1976). A few studies in the United States (Arner, 1908; Slatis et al., 1958), in Europe (Sutter and Tabah, 1952), in Kurdistan Jews (Goldschmidt et al., 1963), in India (Rao and Inbaraj, 1977), and in Jordon (Cook and Hanslip, 1966) have shown that there is no difference in fertility levels among consanguineous and nonconsanguineous couples.
In the present study, the inbreeding effects on fertility are assessed on the basis of a comparison of the number of pregnancies, number of live births, and surviving offspring to at least age of 21 years between consanguineous and nonconsanguineous couples. A total of 2,524 married women has been considered for this purpose.
The mean number of pregnancies is observed to be more than four in consanguineous couples (DK = 4.57; D = 5.20; M = 4.79), while it is observed to be below four in nonconsanguineous couples (DK = 3.14; D = 3.65; M = 3.47) among all the castes under study. Similar values have been observed in the mean number of live births also (DK = 4.24; D = 4.69; M = 4.40, and DK = 3.11; D = 3.50;

M = 3.37 in consanguineous and nonconsanguineous couples respectively). Not much difference has been observed between consanguineous and nonconsanguineous couples in the mean number of surviving offspring among the Desuri Kapu (C = 2.83; NC = 2.83) and the Devanga (C = 3.06; NC = 2.92), while this difference is greater in the Mala (C = 3.14; NC = 2.85).
In the pooled sample of all the three groups, the mean number of pregnancies, live births, and surviving offspring among consanguineous couples is 4.85, 4.44, and 2.99 respectively, as against 3.41, 3.32, and 2.87 among nonconsanguineous couples. In general, the results indicate that consanguineous couples are more fertile, having more pregnancies, live births, and surviving offspring than nonconsanguineous couples. The inbreeding effects are statistically significant on all the fertility parameters studied in the pooled sample. In the individual castes, significant effects are observed only on number of pregnancies and live births. Significant inbreeding effect is found to be absent in respect to mean number of surviving offspring among the Desuri Kapu and the Devanga while it is present among the Mala (Table 2). This differential effect of inbreeding on surviving offspring may be attributed to the differential history of inbreeding among the three castes.
Similar uniform inbreeding effects on fertility variables are noticed in both the regional subsamples (of Nellore Taluk and Sullurpet Taluk) of all the three endogamous caste groups investigated. However, in the regional comparison, significant inbreeding effect on surviving offspring is observed only among the Mala of Nellore Taluk (Tables 3 and 4). This deviation of the Mala in general and the Nellore Taluk Mala in particular

CONCLUSION
The present study finds positive relationships between wealth and/or social level, the frequency of consanguineous marriages, and fertility. Among the three South Indian caste groups, members of the wealthier castes married consanguineously more frequently than did members of the lower-ranking castes. Within each caste, wealthier individuals were more likely to marry relatives than were the less wealthy. Moreover, the consanguineous unions as a group were significantly more fertile than were nonconsanguineous unions. The association of greater wealth or social rank with greater fertility could be construed to result from the presumed better health and material means of the higherranking groups. Paradoxically, however, while the wealthier groups are more fertile than the lower ranking groups, the difference in the number of

surviving offspring between consanguineous and nonconsanguineous unions is not significant. This suggests that child mortality is higher among offspring of consanguineous unions in spite of their greater wealth. This finding could indicate that any deleterious consequences of inbreeding are being experienced postpartum rather than in conception and carrying to term. It is hoped that further research in the area will clear up this interesting paradox.
