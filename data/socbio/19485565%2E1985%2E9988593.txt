ABSTRACT: Hierarchical regression analyses and response surfaces were used in an investigation of relationships between sibling variables and adolescents' perceptions of their family environments, after the impact on the perceptions of earlier family measures was taken into account. The analyses involved Australian adolescents and included 260 Anglo-Australian, 120 Greek, and 90 Southern Italian families. Regression models included terms to test for possible linear, interaction, and curvilinear associations between the sibling and family environment variables. The analysis suggested the propositions that: (a) parents from different ethnic groups create different learning environments for their children and that there are ethnic-group variations in how children perceive their family environments, (b) there are ethnic-group variations in relationships between sibling variables and adolescents' perceptions of their parents' support for learning, and (c) within ethnic groups the relationships between sibling variables and perceived parental support for learning differ, depending on whether the support of fathers or mothers is being considered.

that adolescents' perceptions of family environments have an important influence on their eventual educational attainment (e.g., Gottfredson, 1981; Hauser et al., 1983; Jencks et al., 1983; Campbell, 1983). It was decided, therefore, that in this analysis the learning environments of families would be assessed by the adolescents' perceptions of the support for learning they had received from their parents. Relationships between sibling variables and adolescents' perceptions of family environments may, however, merely represent associations between surrogate environment variables and the perception measures. Research that has investigated relations between sibling variables and cognitive performance, for example, has often indicated that the size of such associations is reduced when social context measures are included in the analyses (e.g., Record et al., 1969; Marjoribanks et al., 1975; Kunz and Peterson, 1977; Valendia et al., 1978). In this study, therefore, relationships between the sibling and perceived environment variables were examined after taking into account the impact on the perception measures of family social status and family environment measures that were assessed when the adolescents were five years younger.
In an alternative explanation of sibling influences on cognitive performance, Page and Grandon (1979) have proposed that the significant associations found in many studies may merely be an artifact of the pooling of subpopulations (see also Melican and Feldt, 1980; Valencia et al., 1981). They have suggested that investigations of sibling correlates of individuals' attributes should be conducted within different social groups. As a further refinement to this study, the relations between the sib-

ling and environment measures were examined in different ethnic groups.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In 1977 the family learning environments of approximately one thousand 11-year-old Australian children were assessed in an analysis of the environmental correlates of their academic achievement (Marjoribanks, 1979, 1980). During 1982 resources permitted the longitudinal study of half the earlier sample. For the latter investigation two parallel pools of families from the original study were formed. The purpose of the substitute pool was to provide a set of alternate families that could be used if families from the first pool could not participate. For this study the sample included 260 Anglo-Australian, 120 Greek, and 90 Southern Italian families. In the Greek and Southern Italian families both parents had migrated to Australia, and they indicated that Greek or Italian was the language typically spoken in their respective homes. Families were classified as Anglo-Australian if both parents were born in either Australia or England and English was the only language spoken in the home. Each of the families in the second survey had a 16-year-old child, and the analyses related to those adolescents. Findings from the investigation need to be interpreted within the limitation that the sample was not random. Throughout the analyses, however, adjustments were made for the design effects of the sample. Significance levels of all statistics were adjusted using the formula: standard error of sample estimate = (design effect)1/2 x simple random sample standard error (Kish and Frankel, 1974; Ross, 1978).

ENVIRONMENT MEASURES
During the initial survey, family learning environments were defined by three dimensions that were labeled parents' aspirations for their children and parents' instrumental and affective orientations toward learning. Parents' aspirations were assessed by the educational and occupational aspirations that parents expressed for their children. Instrumental orientations were defined by an equally weighted composite of parents' achievement orientations for their children, parents' concern for English within the family, and their involvement in reading. Affective orientations were gauged by the sum of the parents' concern for independence and their individualistic- collectivistic achievement-value orientations (see, Marjoribanks, 1981).
A family environment scale, in the form of a semi-structured home interview schedule, was used to obtain responses from parents. Interviewing in homes was conducted by experienced social-survey interviewers. Scores on the items making up each of the environment dimensions were factor analyzed, using principal component analyses, to generate factor scales. The initial family learning environment was measured, therefore, by factor scales that assessed parents' aspirations, and instrumental and affective orientations. In the initial interviews social status data were also collected, and family social status scores were constructed from equally weighted composites of the occupations and education of parents. Information was also obtained from parents about the number of children in their families and the birth-order positions of those children.
In the follow-up study, five years

later, a structured questionnaire was used to gather information about the adolescents' perceptions of their parents' educational and occupational aspirations for them, the encouragement they received from their parents, and their parents' general interest in their education. From the responses two scales were constructed and they were labeled as adolescents' perceptions of their father support and mother support for learning. Each of the environmental dimensions used in the study had a theta reliability estimate greater than 0.75.
RESULTS
Because of the relatively limited sample sizes in the Greek and Southern Italian groups the data were not examined separately for females and males, which is a further restriction of the study. The shapes of the profiles of mean family environment scores for each ethnic group as shown in Figure 1. Scores for the figure (and for later figures) were standardized with means of 50 and standard deviations of 10, calculated over the total sample. The profiles indicated that Anglo-Australian families were characterized by parents who expressed relatively modest aspirations for their children and had strong instrumental orientations and independentindividualistic affective orientations. In contrast, the Greek and Southern Italian parents indicated higher aspirations for their children, weaker instrumental orientations, and dependent-collectivistic affective orientations. Greek adolescents perceived their parents as providing supportive learning environments while the Anglo-Australian and Southern Italian adolescents had perceptions of relatively weaker parental support for learning. When the three ethnic groups

For the adolescents' perceptions of father and mother support for learning, therelations to ethnicity were 0.283 and 0.271, respectively. That is, these initial findings indicated moderate to large ethnic-group differences in the

family learning environment dimensions.
The first investigation of the relationships between the sibling and environment variables involved an analysis of zero-order correlations. In Table 1the results indicated that in each ethnic group the adolescents' perceptions of their parents' support for learning had moderate associations with family social status andparents' aspirations.

ception measures were related, however, only to the instrumental orientations of the Anglo-Australian parents and to the affective orientations in the Southern Italian group. Sib size and birth order had modest relations to the Greek adolescents' perceptions of both father and mother support for learning, and they were associated with the father-support scores for the AngloAustralian adolescents. Although these results indicated that the sibling variables had either negligible or modest relationships to the perceived environment measures, they did suggest ethnic-group variations in the nature of the associations.
Relations between the variables, within each ethnic group were investigated further by plotting regression surfaces that were generated from twostage hierarchical regression models. In the hierarchical models, product terms were included to test for possible interaction effects among the variables while squared terms were added to examine for possible curvilinear relationships. Previous studies have indicated the

presence of interaction and curvilinear associations between sibling measures and individuals' attributes (e.g., Rankin et al., 1979; Knight, 1982; Zajonc, 1983). The regression models were of the form: Z = aX + bY + cX-Y + dX1 + eY2 + constant, where Z, Xand Y represented measures of the adolescents' perceptions of their parents' support, earlier family environment variables, and the sibling variables, respectively. In the analyses, interaction and squared terms that were not related to the perception measures were deleted from the regression models and associations with the remaining predictor variables were reexamined.
The results in Table 2 indicated that after accounting for the influence of family social status and parents' instrumental orientations, sib size made a significant contribution to the variation in the perceived father-support scoresof Anglo-Australian adolescents and to the mother-support scores of Greek adolescents. When affective orientations were included in the regression models, sib size was related to both perception
