ABSTRACT: Demographic, social, and economic influences on cause of death are analyzed for Mexico in 1990. The paper draws on epidemiologic transition theory and empirical studies as a framework to examine effects of 28 independent variables in four groups--demographic, sociocultural, economic, and housing/health/crime--on standardized mortality by cause. Data at the state level are mostly from the Mexican census of 1990. Effects are analyzed through spatial analysis and regression. The principal causes of death reveal distinctive geographical patterns. The regression findings only partially validate hypothesized effects. Overall, the most important predictors are crowding, housing characteristics, marriage and divorce, and manufacturing workforce. By variable group, there are effects for specific causes of death. For instance, hypothesized direct economic prosperity influences are present for one cause category, mixed for two, and refuted for cancer and heart disease. The findings are discussed and interpreted relative to the research literature and reveal differences from epidemiologic transition theory, effects that are specific to Mexico, and divergence from some of the patterns in advanced nations.

The present study has the objectives to describe the contemporary cause of death patterns in Mexico, to examine the socioeconomic factors that are associated with particular causes of death, and to interpret the factors relative to a conceptual framework. The study also compares the relative importance of major groups of socioeconomic factors on cause of death. The paper utilizes the techniques of spatial analysis and multivariate statistics. Although there have been several studies that examined causes of death in Mexico (Fernandez, 1983; Rabell and Mier y Terán, 1986; Camposortega Cruz, 1988, 1989a; Perez Astorga, 1980,1988), those studies did not analyze socioeconomic influences associated with cause-specific mortality. The present paper intends to explore and determine what are such factors and to compare their relative intensities and differences.
The paper first discusses general mortality changes, presents a conceptual

framework, and examines patterns of cause-specific mortality. Then the paper turns to a series of regression models to analyze groups of socioeconomic factors associated with cause-specific mortality. The paper ends with a discussion of the findings and conclusions.
From 1950 to 1993, Mexican life expectancy lengthened overall by twenty-one years, a remarkable increase. Male life expectancy in 1993 was sixty-six years and female life expectancy was seventy-three years (Population Reference Bureau, 1993). By comparison, U.S. life expectancies at birth were seventy-two years for males and seventy-nine years for females in 1990 (National Center for Health Statistics, 1993). The average Mexican standardized mortality rate was 5.0 in 1990, with relatively little variation by state.
As seen in Table 1, the distribution of cause of death in Mexico changed in the 1980's. The leading causes of death in

1990 were cardiovascular, followed by trauma, nutritional/metabolic/endocrine/immunity (abbreviated as NMEI), respiratory, and cancer. These five causes accounted for two-thirds of Mexican deaths in 1990. There were some major shifts in cause of death 1979-1990, with increases in cardiovascular, nutritional, and cancer, and decreases in respiratory and infectious/ parasitic diseases. This shift reflects social changes that took place in the 1980's. In particular, declines in respiratory and infectious/parasitic categories reflect improved environmental conditions regarding sanitation, pollution, and public health. On the other hand, the increase in cardiovascular mortality may stem from dietary and lifestyle changes, while the relative increase in cancer deaths may be due to environmental and dietary alterations. The decrease in undefined diseases is linked to improved statistical accuracy in designation of cause of death.
Overall, trends in cause of death reflect the benefits from greater emphasis on sanitation and public health, but deterioration stemming from dietary, stress,

and pollution factors. Despite an increase in population size, the total number of deaths decreased slightly between 1979 and 1990, which reflects a substantial lowering in the crude mortality rate, as well as age structural shifts in the 1980's.
In the present study, variables were examined spatially through use of a geographic information system (ESRI, 1996). The spatial analysis was useful in determining the geographical patterns of cause of death in 1990 and changes in patterns since 1980. For instance, spatial patterns for cardiovascular and cancer are highly similar, but differ from the other causes. Cardiovascular and cancer rates show higher levels in the more economically advanced parts of Mexico, including the border states and Mexico City, and lower levels in the poorer and less developed areas such as the Bajio and south. The results of this analysis are useful in informing the regression analysis later in this paper. Similar spatial study was done for all the independent variables. Several of the spatial findings are included in the results section and others are described elsewhere (Pick and Butler, 1994).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study examines socioeconomic influences on cause of death through descriptive and multivariate statistical techniques. The analysis is done at the state level, i.e., the sample is the thirty-two Mexican federal entities, which include thirty-one states plus the Federal District. The study seeks to determine demographic, social, and economic influences on death rates by cause of death. The level of analysis is macro, i.e., at the state level, rather than micro, i.e., at the individual level. Any effects and social patterns discovered represent socio-economic effects of aggregated attributes of the states as a whole on the aggregated mortality for entire states. The emphasis on state-level effects in the present study has the weakness of not reflecting individual effects. On the other hand, the macro effects are useful in understanding broad macro trends and associations for causes of death. Many studies in Mexico and elsewhere have examined trends in cause of death for aggregates of states or larger entities, for instance at the national level (for example, see Preston, 1975; Rabell and Mier y Terán, 1986; Perez, 1988; Jiménez, 1995) and have provided important macro-level findings and conclusions. In the present analysis of Mexico as a whole, an individual-level nationwide analysis was not possible due to lack of national data sets containing mortality as well as a substantial socioeconomic attributes.
The mortality data are compiled from the state death registration system by the federal government and appear in the Anuario Estadístico (INEGI, 1991). Although the Mexican vital registration system has been criticized (for instance, Bruch et al.,

1980; Garcia y Garma, 1988), it improved in the latter part of the 80's and in the 90's due to more comprehensive and more accurate registration (INEGI, personal communication, 1997). Although not as accurate as vital registration systems in the United States and Western European nations, the contemporary Mexican data are considered by the present investigators to be accurate enough for the purposes of this analysis that focuses on associations with socioeconomic factors.
To accomplish the present study, we adjusted the mortality rates through a process of standardization, which was necessary in order to adjust for differences in the age structure between states. The method used is indirect standardization (Keyfitz and Flieger, 1971). The standard population selected is the nation of Mexico, 1990. The method adjusts the cause-specific death rate of the given population by a factor that is the ratio of the number of cause-specific deaths in the given population divided by the number of cause-specific deaths based on the mortality rates of the standard population and the age structure of the given population. More specifically, the standardized causespecific mortality rate for each state is adjusted by a factor d/Summation (MJ3^, where d represents the total cause-specific deaths in the state, Ma is the age-causespecific death rate for the nation and Pa is the population of a five-year age group for the state. It is important to mention that, since the age distribution of the population has small variation between states, indirect standardization in this instance has only a modest effect on values.
The statistical models are designed to assess the associations between selected independent variables and mortality dependent variables. The associations are

studied through simple correlations and regressions, based on a standard statistical package (SPSS Inc., 1995). All correlations are Pearson type.
The regression analysis is organized into two submodels. In both submodels, standardized mortality rate for the five major causes of death constitutes the dependent variable. In the first submodel, all twenty-eight socioeconomic variables are eligible as independent variables, based on a stepwise regression algorithm, with the number of steps fixed at four. This submodel is intended to test which are the most significant individual factors associated with cause-specific mortality. The submodel seeks to validate the postulated influences of the independent variable on each cause of death.
A second submodel examines the influence of each group of independent socioeconomic factors on each cause of death. In this instance, a somewhat different regression technique is applied. For each group of factors--for instance, demographic--the cross-correlations of the independent variables are examined to reduce collinearity. The variables in each group are reduced down to the four that eliminate the largest amount of cross-correlation between independent variables. Then the resulting four variables are forced into the regression equation. This submodel has the goal to ascertain (1) whether each variable group has an overall significant effect on each cause of death, and (2) to analyze which independent variables are most influential for each of twenty regressions, that is, one regression for each combination of independent variable group and cause-ofdeath dependent variable. It is expected that the most significant independent variables will show general correspon-

dence between the two submodels. Taken together, the two submodels will enable determination of both the most important independent variable effects, as well as the groups of independent variables that are most important and what variables within groups are the most significant.
Although other methodologies could be employed including factor analysis, this choice of methodology has the advantage of appropriateness to small sample sizes (7V=32) and to preserving the group classification stemming from conceptual theory and empirical literature. Also, the methodology is appropriate to the sample's entirely numeric variables.
POSTULATED MORTALITY INFLUENCES
The overall framework of this study is that mortality is influenced by a variety of demographic, social, economic, and health attributes. The conceptual approach draws on epidemiological transition theory (Omran, 1977, 1982) and also is based on empirical bodies of evidence regarding social and economic influences on mortality (Kitagawa and Häuser, 1975; Guzman, 1989; Camposortega, 1989a, 1989¿>; Preston and Taubman, 1994). Epidemiologie transition theory is regarded as a part of demographic transition theory (Rockett, 1994; Kirk, 1996). It postulates that there are four stages in the drop in mortality: (1) famine and pestilence, (2) lowering pandemics, and (3) degenerative and manmade diseases (Omran, 1977), as well as a fourth stage more recently added, (4) hybristic, or mortality affected strongly by behavior and life-style (Rogers and Hackenberg, 1987). The progression of mortality lowering through these stages can last for centuries as occurred in Europe or occur over decades as in developing nations in the twentieth century (Omran, 1977).

Movement from Stages (1) through (3) has been influenced in rough time order by rising standards of living, improved nutrition and alterations in diseases, medical progress, and public health programs, while more recent movement to Stage (4) has been influenced by behaviors and lifestyles of people (Omran, 1977; Rogers and Hackenberg, 1987).
The theory of epidemiologic transition is meaningful to Mexico in the mid to late twentieth century and to this study. Major Mexican progress on control of infectious diseases occurred in the 1940's and 1950's, while chronic diseases have become progressively more important in the second half of the century (Camposortega, 1987a). Mexico has begun to move somewhat into Stage 4, since lifestyle influences such as violence, drugs, and diet have become more important in recent decades. Epidemiologic transition theory is appropriate for Mexico due to the extreme spatial differences in both the levels of mortality and the factors affecting mortality (Rabell and Mier y Terán, 1986; Pick and Butler, 1990, 1994; Jiménez, 1995). In other words, different regions of Mexico are in different stages of relatively rapid epidemiologic transition, so all the theoretic factors postulated may be important today. Mostly following epidemiologic transition theory, the present paper classifies independent variables into four groups. The housing, health, and crime group reflects the influences of public health, sanitation, and the social environment; the sociocultural group reflects social status and the macro level aspects of lifestyle; and the economic prosperity group contains aggregated economic attributes that reflect rising standards of living. Data were not available at the state

level in Mexico on changes in the nature of diseases and behavioral elements, so those aspects of transition theory are excluded. Specific hypotheses for attributes are covered later in this section.
In addition to the justification of these groups from epidemiological transition theory, there have been studies predominantly in advanced nations of the importance of socioeconomic factors in mortality. A large U.S. study based on individual records (Kitagawa and Häuser, 1973) showed substantial effects for income, occupation, education, and race. A recent literature review of studies of determinants of older mortality, mostly in the United States, confirmed the importance of social and economic factors (Preston and Taubman, 1994). There are numerous empirical studies for advanced nations that have confirmed consistently that higher social and economic status is correlated with lower mortality rates, both for total mortality and for a variety of causes of death (for instance, Bassett and Krieger, 1986; Feldman et al., 1989; Page and Kunz, 1980; and Williams, 1990). In Mexico, there have been relatively few studies of socioeconomic determinants of mortality at the national level. Partly this has related to problems historically in the vital registration system (García y Garma, 1988). Among the existing studies are those of Camposortega (1989b) noting urban-rural mortality differences and of Mojarro and Nunez (1975) describing impacts of education and housing for infant mortality.
In addition to the three variable groups stemming from epidemiologic transition theory, a fourth demographic group was added. The most obvious demographic variable influencing mortality, namely age, is already controlled for by utilizing

156

standardized mortality rates. In Mexico, the lowering effect on mortality of urban versus rural location has been confirmed as an important demographic influence (CEED, 1970; Mojarro and Nunez, 1975; Garcia y Garma, 1983; Camposortega, 1989&). Another important demographic influence on mortality is nuptiality, as seen for the United States (Gove, 1973; Kisker and Goldman, 1987; Hu and Goldman, 1990; Zick and Smith, 1991; Lillard and Panis, 1996) and Bangladesh (Rahman, 1993). Although the researchers could not locate similar Mexican studies, nuptiality is postulated to be a mortality influence especially since the family is regarded as strong in Mexico.
Based on this conceptual background, the independent variables are categorized into four groups: demographic, socio-cultural status (SCS), housing/health/crime (abbreviated henceforth as HHC), and economic prosperity. The groups have the advantage not only of identifying the significant associated independent factors but also of comparing the relative explanatory power of the groups with each other.
This section discusses in more detail the choice of specific independent variables, which are listed in Table 2. For the demographic group, the urban indicators are urbanization, defined in Mexico as the ratio of persons living in places of 2,500 or more to all persons (INEGI, 1992), and urbanization change 1950-90. The nuptiality attributes included are marriage and divorce. It is expected that states with higher marriage rates and lower divorce rates will have reduced mortality due to enhanced familial caring for the health of spouses and other family members. On the other hand, studies have indicated that divorced persons have increased mortal-

ity compared to married (Zick and Smith, 1991).
The SCS characteristics included are well known ones of literacy, secondary education, professional/technical/managerial occupations, agricultural occupation, indigenous language, religion, and race. In Mexico, the predominant racial distinction is between the mestizo and indigenous, i.e., Indian population segments. There is not a sharp demarcation between these two groups, since the mestizo population was formed historically from a mixture of Indian and Spanish populations. For this paper, indigenous is measured by the per cent of population who speak an indigenous language. Indigenous language knowledge is independent of knowledge of Spanish, i.e., some indigenous language speakers may know Spanish and others may not. In conformance with SCS results on racial differences in the United States and elsewhere, it is expected that the lower the racial status, i.e., the higher the proportion of indigenous population, the higher the mortality (Pick, 1977; Preston and Haines, 1991; Mantón et al., 1987; Otten et al., 1990; Behrman et al., 1991). In the context of racial differences in the United States, studies have indicated that blackwhite mortality differences are largely due to socioeconomic differences (Keil et al., 1992; Mutchler and Burr, 1991), and the same may be true in Mexico, although studies have not been done.
The last SCS variable is non-Catholic religion. In Mexico, several studies point to the dominant Catholic majority population tending to have higher social and economic status. For example, in a study of socioeconomic effects on fertility, the proportion non-Catholic increased the fertility (Pick et al., 1989a), a direction of effect on

diseases, i.e., cardiovascular and cancer, but to be neutral for the other causes of death. From the standpoint of transition theory, this variable relates particularly to the fourth (hybristic) stages.
Crime is mostly associated with the fourth transition stage, since it is behaviorally controlled. The crime variable of penal sentences per capita is expected to influence trauma mortality but not to affect the other causes of death.
The last group of attributes is economic prosperity. It is important in epidemiologic transition theory in providing for rising living standards and has also been widely confirmed as generally beneficial in advanced nations through empirical studies (Preston andTaubman, 1994).
There are eleven indicators of the level of economic prosperity for a state, including economic activity, unemployment, underemployment, public investment by the federal government in the state, value of corporations, new mortgage value, the proportion of workforce for three categories, prevalence of telephones, and motor vehicle ownership. With the exception of workforce characteristics, these variables are expected to lower the level of mortality. Such a relationship is supported by economic models that have been constructed and tested based on the consumption of items that maximize a utility function for improved health. These models postulate that consumers can consume items that will improve health status (see for example, Rosenzweig and Schultz, 1983) and that greater economic resources will improve health or mortality levels. They have, however, had limited empirical testing.
Three aggregate workforce variables are included. The personal services and commercial workforces are postulated to

decrease mortality rates for all cause of death categories, since services reflects a more advanced economy. However, the manufacturing workforce is postulated to increase cancer and respiratory mortality, through the counteracting detrimental environmental and pollution effects. The effects of an elevated manufacturing sector may be expected to be exacerbated in Mexico compared to the United States, because there are weaker environmental controls in Mexico (Sanchez, 1990; U.S. President, 1993). Manufacturing workforce is not hypothesized to influence the other causes of death.
The hypotheses on the broad impacts of variables from the four categories of independent variables are briefly summarized in Table 2. The variables are drawn from two data sources, the 1990 Mexican Census of Population (INEGI, 1992) and the Anuario Estadistico in 1991 and 1992 (INEGI, 1991-1992). The data are entirely for 1990, except for two 1980 characteristics, in the Housing/Health/Crime Group. They are Hospitals Per Capita, and No Meat and Eggs, i.e., the per cent of census respondents having no meat and eggs in their diet. No meat and eggs was dropped for the 1990 Mexican census (INEGI, 1992), and the hospital data by state were not available for 1990; these variables were considered important enough to the study to utilize the data for 1980. For these attributes, we assume that the geographical distributions did not change very much in the decade of the 1980's.
RESULTS
Since age structure does not vary much between Mexican states (Pick and Butler, 1994), the age-standardized annual mortality rate is significantly corre-

lated (r=0.78) with the crude annual mortality rate. The standardized mortality rate, in turn, is strongly positively correlated with the NMEI and respiratory mortality rates, and also with cardiovascular mortality. However, it is not correlated with trauma or cancer mortality. It is not surprising that these three causes of death are also significantly intercorrelated.
Cancer mortality, shown in Figure 1, is very strongly linked to cardiovascular mortality (r=0.86). In fact, this correlation is the highest among all the mortality cross-correlations. The reason for this very strong association is that both causes-of-death have high values throughout the border region, as well as the Federal District and Jalisco. However, for both attributes, the outlying Mexico City megalopolitan region, i.e., the states surrounding the Federal District, has moderate to low mortality. For these two causes, the consistently high values throughout the border region is remarkable and will be examined further in the discussion.
Spatially, the respiratory mortality rate, shown in Figure 2, has higher values in the Federal District, Mexico, Puebla, and surrounding states, as well as Jalisco. This finding reflects the well known air pollution effects stemming from the major metropolises of Mexico City, Puebla, and Guadalajara and influencing surrounding areas. Respiratory mortality is mixed in the border region, and moderate to low in the south and Yucatan peninsula. In the latter regions, environmental and pollution factors are more favorable. This spatial pattern is dramatic and contrasts sharply with cancer mortality (Figure 1) as well as the other cause of death categories. NMEI is correlated with respiratory and has a similar spatial pattern. Trauma has a polyglot spatial pattern; for

instance trauma is high in several highly advanced states (Baja, Jalisco, Mexico) and at the same time very high in the poor states of Zacatecas, Guerrero, and Oaxaca. The reason for this polyglot pattern may be the vagaries of such influences as state safety regulations, terrain, state criminal laws and enforcement, and the "climate" for mortal crimes and suicide. Overall, trauma is higher in Baja California, the western mountain states, south, and southeast.
On the basis of simple correlations, there are many strong associations between independent attributes and causes of death. It is important to note that the associations are much stronger for individual causes of death than for standardized total mortality. In fact, the only significant simple correlation for standardized total mortality rate is an inverse relationship with underemployment. On the other hand, all cause-specific mortality variables have many significant simple correlations, except for trauma. The enhanced associations point right away to the importance of disaggregating mortality into its causespecific components. This rich set of relationships would be largely hidden by studying only total mortality. On the other hand, for purposes such as population projections, etc., it is often more appropriate to utilize aggregated mortality.
The lack of simple associations for trauma mortality is explained by its unusual polyglot geographical distribution. The strongest respiratory association is with manufacturing workforce, which is not surprising since manufacturing is a source of air pollution, especially given Mexico's weak environmental regulatory enforcement (U.S. President, 1993).
Cardiovascular and cancer mortality have the strongest simple associations

high crowding occurs in more rural and lower socioeconomic-status parts of the nation. However, those areas in the south region tend to have improved diet (more vegetable-based, lower fat) and lower psychological stress, factors that lower cardiovascular-disease risks (Black, 1992). Divorce is associated with increased cardiovascular risk because of the wellsubstantiated reduction in familial caring in divorced/separated populations versus married populations (Kisker and Goldman, 1987; Hu and Goldman, 1990). This effect may be amplified in a Catholic nation, for which the divorce rates are much lower than in the United States. The associations noted here refer to those at the state level, i.e., effects on the entire population of divorced persons rather than on individuals.

ronment and NMEI diseases is unknown and worthy of further investigation. The influence of marriage in lowering NMEI mortality may be ascribed to the benefits of married populations having enhanced familial care-giving (Kisker and Goldman, 1987; Hu and Goldman, 1990; Rahman, 1993).
4. Respiratory.--Respiratory mortality is linked significantly with manufacturing workforce, marriage, crowding, and literacy. The strong effect of manufacturing is due to environmental pollution, in particular, air pollution. In spite of Mexico's strong environmental regulations, they are enforced with laxity (Sanchez, 1990; U.S. President, 1993), and the nation's urban areas suffer from bad air pollution, much of it from industrial sources (Lacy,

crowding is similar to its explanation for cardiovascular, in particular that it indirectly is tied in a macro sense to reduced diet and higher living stresses. The inverse association for housing without toilet is similar to that for crowding. Agricultural occupation's influence may be due to exposure to environmental contaminants and pollution, which are more severe in Mexico than in the United States due to considerably less environmental enforcement.
Overall, the most prominent variables that stand out in predicting cause-specific mortality are crowding, housing characteristics, marriage and divorce, and manufacturing workforce. These attributes are not predominantly SCS ones but rather from other groups.
REGRESSION RESULTS: SUBMODEL II
The results of the regressions by groups of socioeconomic variables indicate considerable differences in effects within groups for different causes of death. These regression results are summarized in Table 4, which shows, for each group, results for the five cause-ofdeath categories. As discussed earlier, each regression is constrained to include only selected independent variables for that group. These results are first summarized by cause of death, before examining the results for the group hypotheses.
1. Cardiovascular.--All four groups are highly significant; in particular, the regressions have overall significance at the p = 0.01 level. The Demographic Group has a strong positive influence of divorce, with similar interpretation to the stepwise results. The SCS Group is dominated by the association with professional/technical/managerial occupation, which reflects a postulated SCS effect.

The Housing/Health/Crime Group is dominated by the inverse crowding effect, which also was most important for the stepwise regression results and is similarly interpreted. The Economic Group has the strongest association with value of new mortgages, followed by public federal investment. Both these effects reflect economic prosperity, with the interpretation that enhanced prosperity leads to higher standards of living and more support for public health, care services, and facilities.
2. Trauma.--Only the Economic Group has a significant trauma effect. Within this group, the only significant association is underemployment. The explanation is the same as noted previously. The lack of influence of other demographic and social groups points to trauma not being linked to socio-cultural factors, but rather associated with other sets of factors not in this study. For example, government regulation and aggregate job stress and lifestyle indicators might be looked into.
3. NMEL--For NMEI, the Demographic, SCS, and Economic Groups show significant regression results. For the Demographic Group, urbanization has become the most important variable. Urban location may possibly increase these diseases due to urban stress factors; this interpretation calls for further epidemiological research. The influence of marriage was apparent in the stepwise regressions and already has been discussed. Although the SCS regression is significant, none of its individual attributes is. For the HHC Group, the only significant individual association is a reverse one with crowding. This finding is unexplained and calls for further research. The Economic Group has the already-noted

effect of manufacturing workforce, a direct effect of telephones, and an inverse effect with corporation value. Corporation value directly reflects the economic prosperity of a state and supports the benefits to NMEI disease of improved standard of living.
4. Respiratory.--For respiratory, only the Economic Group is significant overall. Within this group, only manufacturing workforce is significant as an individual factor, a result that is explained similarly to that for the stepwise regression.
The paucity of group results for respiratory is surprising, since the stepwise result was strong, having four significant associations. This finding implies that for respiratory, there are combined influences of attributes across several attribute groups. In other words, respiratory effects act synergistically between groups rather than within groups.
5. Cancer.--For cancer, all groups reveal significant associations, pointing to strong and broad socioeconomic linkages. The individual effects within the Demographic Group are divorce and urbanization. More urbanized areas tend to have greater environmental degradation, which is associated with enhanced cancer risk (Henderson et al., 1991). The SCS Group has a single significant association, professional/technical/managerial occupation, which is opposite to the usually cited effect in U.S.-based research studies that higher SCS leads to reduced cancer mortality. This finding for Mexico, however, highlights the heightened cancer mortality in more advanced regions of the nation. An intermediate explanation may relate to increased environmental pollution, and worsened diet, i.e., diets with higher content of fat and carcinogens (Henderson et al., 1991). For

the HHC Group, the only individual association is an opposite one with crowding, an effect already noted for the stepwise results. The Economic Group has positive associations with telephones, value of mortgages, and taxes and duties collected. These influences point to the detrimental influence of economic prosperity on cancer mortality. Poorer areas' lowered risk of cancer mortality (see Figure 1) is not surprising given their improved diets and lowered environmental contamination.
Comparing the four groups on overall statistical significance of the regressions (see Table 4), the Economic Group has the highest overall model fits, explaining between one-third and sixty per cent of rsquare. The other three groups reveal less and roughly equal overall model fits, explaining between one-tenth and sixty-five per cent of r-square. In particular, these groups are weak and have nonsignificant model fits in explaining trauma and respiratory causes of death.
DISCUSSION
The research results point to strong socioeconomic influences on cause-specific mortality in Mexico. The most important cause-specific effects are due to crowding, housing characteristics, marriage and divorce, and manufacturing workforce. The prominence of these attributes may be better understood by considering Mexican society. Crowding has different connotations in Mexico than in the United States. In Mexico, crowding is strongly inversely associated with urbanization. The most metropolitan states are those with the least household crowding, while very rural areas have increased household crowding. As a consequence,

166

Pick and Butler

Social Biology

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

crowding becomes an inverse proxy variable for urbanization, and the interpretations of crowding effects become more understandable and more keyed to the mortality literature. For instance, crowding's reduced effects on cardiovascular and cancer mortality may be re-stated as urbanization's increasing effects. This explanation is plausible, since many epidemiological studies link environmental degradation and diet with both causes of death. In Mexico, the urbanized states have amplified environmental degradation, since strong environmental regulations have heretofore been only weakly enforced. Likewise, the diet in Mexico's metropolitan areas is much fattier and more meat-based, factors linked to both cancer and cardiovascular disease (Henderson et al., 1991; Black, 1992).
Poor housing characteristics have greater mortality impact in Mexico than in the United States. First, because Mexico is a developing nation and still has substantial infectious diseases, housing attributes such as lack of running water may be directly linked to the spread of disease, whereas this is rarely true today in the United States. Second, housing characteristics are correlated to SCS. Hence, they may be serving as proxies for SCS, although some directionality of SCS effects may be different from the mortality literature, largely based on advanced nations.
Marriage and divorce are well-known factors from the mortality literature that influence disease and mortality (Gove, 1973; Kisker and Goldman, 1987; Hu and Goldman, 1990; Rahman 1993). The underlying reason is that marriage fosters caring for the health of family members, while divorce and single status tend to reduce such caring and lower overall health. The marriage/divorce factors may

be even greater in Mexico, since marriage is a stronger social norm in Mexico than in the United States, and divorce is still socially proscribed in Mexico. The wellknown family structure effects may be amplified in Mexico compared to many advanced nations.
The prominent effect of manufacturing workforce is helped by lowered environmental enforcement in Mexico. Hence, the environmental degradation caused by manufacturing is amplified in Mexico versus the United States. Uncontrolled plant emissions in Mexico's largest cities is an indication of this problem, although some of the worst cases in Mexico City have recently been ameliorated (Pick and Butler, 1997).
The hypotheses of group effects are only partially validated by the research findings. The extent of validation may be summarized as follows.
I. Demographic.--The hypotheses on marriage and divorce are validated. The results on demographic indicators of an advanced society are partly confirmed and partly refuted. For instance, there are neutral effects from urbanization instead of the positive effects hypothesized. The reason is that some cause-specific mortality, specifically cardiovascular, respiratory, and cancer, are neutral or reduced in rural areas, due to particular features of a developing nation.
II. Socio-cultural Status (SCS).--In Mexico, higher socio-cultural status generally tends to increase cause-specific mortality, rather than reduce it as hypothesized. This hypothesis is validated for the causes of trauma, respiratory, and cancer. No influences are noted for either indigenous language or religion. The lack of effect of indigenous language stands in sharp contrast to the United States where

Vol. 45, No. 3-4

Causes of Death

167

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

black-white differences in mortality level and causation have been strongly documented (Pick, 1977; Mantón et al., 1987; Otten et al., 1990; Behrman et al., 1991; Preston and Haines, 1991). One explanation for the lessened ethnic differences in Mexican death causation is that the economic advantages of mestizo, i.e., nonindigenous, status may be offset by less healthy diet and greater exposure to environmental degradation and stress.
III. Housing/Health/Crime (HHC).-- The hypothesis that better housing improves mortality rates for all causes is not supported. In particular, low crowding is associated with higher cause-specific mortality for cancer, cardiovascular, and NMEI.
IV. Economic Prosperity.--The hypotheses have mixed results. The postulated positive effects of economic prosperity are validated for trauma, mixed for NMEI and respiratory, and refuted for cardiovascular and cancer. This finding points to economic prosperity being a complex factor. For some death causes, it serves to build and enhance health services and facilities; for others, these advantages are overwhelmed by the detriments of more environmental degradation, less healthy diets, and other adverse changes to lifestyle.
In terms of epidemiological transition theory, the biggest surprise is the theoretically opposite findings for various indicators of economic prosperity for chronic illness categories. Instead of rising standards of living lowering cancer and heart deaths, they contribute to raising them. For respiratory and NMEI categories, there are adverse effects from manufacturing workforce. Transition theory would favor manufacturing as a reflection of economic productivity, but this may be

overshadowed by the detrimental environmental effects of this sector in Mexico. On the other hand, the trauma category is fully in concert with transition theory. For the socio-cultural group, the effects are opposite of those expected from transition theory for chronic categories, with higher professional occupational status increasing chronic mortality, although respiratory findings are in the expected direction. For the housing/ health/crime group, there is lack of confirmation of the theory, in particular, the hypothesis of beneficial effects from improved housing is refuted for cancer, cardiovascular, and NMEI. The SCS and HHC results for chronic diseases indicate that these disease categories are more favorable in states with lower average social status and poorer quality housing. Although opposite to transition theory, these results may be due to the reduced long-term susceptibility of poorer, less well-housed populations to these major chronic diseases due to improved diet, external environmental conditions, and lifestyle. The demographic group is not relevant to this theory, as mentioned earlier.
Overall, the theory is not supported from the standpoint of this particular study in Mexico in 1990. Part of the reason may be that present-day Mexico has some unique factors that overwhelm ordinary theoretic considerations. In particular, factors associated with cities and urban areas, places with higher social and economic status, are linked to adverse air pollution, other environmental impacts, urban stresses, less favorable diet for chronic disease categories, and other adverse impacts. The theory may have applied better earlier in the century during the earlier history of mortality transition,

168

or presently by enlarging the attribute scope of empirical studies.
Future studies might be enhanced by adding factors for the hybristic stage, i.e., behavioral and life-style attributes not available in Mexico for this study. For respiratory death, the particular influence in Mexico of air pollution as seen through spatial analysis and evident among other things from Mexico City's status as the world's most air-polluted major city (Lacy, 1993; Pick and Butler, 1997) may call for inclusion of specific air-contamination variables not generic to epidemiologic transition theory as well as other environmental variables. For instance, state air pollution attributes would be valuable, but are currently unavailable from the Mexican government.
CONCLUSIONS
Mexican mortality dropped substantially since the mid-twentieth century. In the latter half of the century, it has been overshadowed by fertility and migration as demographic components of change. However, as fertility continues to drop and the Mexican population ages, mortality will become a more important population change factor (Ham, 1995).
The present research has the goal of examining the influences of socioeconomic factors on standardized cause-specific mortality. The data are drawn from Mexican government sources, mostly from the Mexican census of 1990. The study utilized GIS and statistical methods, principally regression analysis, to describe the geographic patterns of cause-specific mortality and to construct models to test hypotheses regarding the effects of socioeconomic factors. These factors are divided into four groups--demographic, socio-

cultural status, housing/health/crime, and economic prosperity.
The major results of the study are the following:
1. The principal causes of death have very distinctive geographical patterns, with cardiovascular, NMEI, and cancer mortality higher in the more advanced parts of the nation, in particular, the border region and major metropolitan states. The patterns for trauma and respiratory mortality are more complicated and are not explained by simple urban or SCS gradients.
2. Hypotheses were established for effects from the major groups of socioeconomic effects, based on epidemiologic transition theory and mortality literature, as well as Mexican-specific factors.
3. The hypotheses were tested through use of correlation and regression analyses, combining stepwise and fixed entry of variables.
4. Results revealed significant effects for all causes of death. In a separate set of regressions for each group of independent variables, most results were significant, especially for cardiovascular, NMEI, and cancer mortality. For trauma and respiratory mortality, only the economic group regressions were significant.
5. Overall, the most important predictors of cause-specific mortality were crowding, housing characteristics, marriage and divorce, and manufacturing workforce. These predictors are not predominantly SCS or economic factors, as often pointed to in the mortality literature, but rather other types.
6. The hypothesized effects are only partially validated. In particular, for the Demographic Group, marriage/divorce effects were validated, but the other effects are mixed. For the SCS Group, SCS

factors tend to increase cause-specific mortality, rather than reduce it as hypothesized. No influences are noted for indigenous language or religion. For the Housing/Health/Crime Group, the hypothesis of housing's positive influence for all five causes was refuted for cancer, cardiovascular, and NMEI, with no effects present for the other twocauses.For Economic Prosperity, there were mixed results. The expected direct effects of economic prosperity were confirmed for trauma, mixed for NMEI and respiratory, and refuted for cardiovascular and cancer. The implication is that economic prosperity must be viewed as a more complicated mortality factor than it seems at face value.
7. The theoretic framework of epidemiologic transition theory is not well supported for this particular study for Mexico in 1990.Although the study results indicated high statistical importance for economic or standard of living influences, the directions of effects are mostly opposite to those postulated in transition theory, especially for chronic causes of

death. For the variable group of sociocultural, the directions of effects are mostly opposite to those postulated in transition theory, especially for chronic causes of death. For the variable group of socio-cultural, the direction of effect for chronic diseases is opposite to the theory, although respiratory conforms to it. For the housing, health, and crime group, the effects are theoretically opposite forcancer, cardiovascular, and NMEI.
8. Future studies of influences on causes of death at the state level may benefit by enhanced state-level data for hybristic influences and for air pollution, which is a specific feature of contemporary urban Mexico. The Stage 4 factors may help to provide greater support for epidemiologic transition theory.
9. Generally, many preconceptions about Mexican cause of death influences have to be altered. The reason is that Mexico is a unique developing nation and diverges from some accepted theory and empirical results that have been mostly based on advanced countries such as the United States.
