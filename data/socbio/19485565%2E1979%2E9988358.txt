ABSTRACT: This research examines the infant mortality/socioeconomic status relationship in Toledo, Ohio, for the years centering around 19S0, 1960, and 1970 in order to depict variables that contributed most to infant mortality for each time period. Zero-order correlation coefficients demonstrated that the relationship has widened mainly as a result of an increasing inverse neonatal/socioeconomic pattern which was due in part to a "cause-period cross-over effect" (exogenous causes of death were contributing to deaths in the neonatal period in 1970). Further examination suggested that the status variables through which the differentials were operating have shifted from one time period to another. In 19S0, crowded housing conditions and unemployment were primarily responsible; in 1960, it was housing and income; and in 1970, marital instability and income predominated. This paper suggests that as new social phenomena emerge they quickly affect sensitive indicators of well-being such as the infant mortality rate.

The infant mortality rate has historically been regarded as a very sensitive index of differences in the levels of social and economic well-being among various population groups (Newsholme, 1910; Woodbury, 1925). Writing early in the present century, Newsholme (1910, p. 28) stated that "infant mortality is the most sensitive index we possess of social welfare and of sanitary administration, especially under urban conditions." He also stated that the economic and social conditions prevailing in a population are inversely related to mortality levels in general, but especially to child mortality.
Over the years, the infant mortality rate has remained relatively consistent and sensitive to socioeconomic differences on an international level (Hauser, 1959). Although numerous studies suggest that infant mortality continues to be highly sensitive to socioeconomic differences on an international level (Stockwell, 1966; Ekanem, 1972), a number of recent stud-

ies have raised questions concerning the precise status of this traditionally inverse relationship within an advanced, relatively low-mortality country such as the United States (Willie, 1959; Stockwell, 1962; Donabedian et al., 1965).
Although the traditional pattern has been one where infant mortality was inversely associated with levels of socioeconomic status, several recent studies have presented evidence to suggest that this relationship was changing in the United States. Among these is the study by Willie (1959, pp. 225-226) who found that "little association was demonstrated between infant mortality rates and the socioeconomic status level of ecological areas in Syracuse, New York." On the basis of his observations, and since the vast majority of infant deaths in the United States occur during the neonatal period, Willie concluded that socioeconomic status factors appeared to exert little effect on the patterning of the distribution of infant mortality rates.

StockwelPs (1962) study of Providence, Rhode Island, was consistent with Willie's findings. Of the five socioeconomic indexes used, only income exhibited a significant inverse relationship to infant mortality. However, infant mortality still appeared to be sensitive to differences in other components of socioeconomic status (e.g., occupation and education) when analysis was restricted to the postneonatal component, or to that segment of infant mortality where the major causes of death are farther removed from the physiological processes of gestation and birth. Neonatal mortality, on the other hand, which accounted for the vast majority of infant deaths, and where the major causes of death were more directly associated with birth (e.g., birth injury, prematurity), displayed a random pattern when related to socioeconomic status. On the basis of this
evidence, Stockwell (1962, pp. 110-111)
concluded:
we might now be at a point where it is time to reconsider the assumption pertaining to the infant mortality rate being the most sensitive index we possess of the level of social and economic well-being characterizing a given population group . . . it may well be that the approximate inverse relationship noted between socioeconomic status and postneonatal mortality (where the infectious diseases continue to take the heaviest toll), will eventually be eliminated. Should this be the case, the future could see an even greater decline in the significance of infant mortality as an index of socioeconomic status.
Both of the preceding studies contain the implicit suggestion that where infant mortality was low, and where the major proportion of infant deaths take place during the neonatal period and are due to endogenous causes (e.g., immaturity, birth injuries, congenital malformations, postnatal asphyxia), the traditional negative correlation between infant mortality and socioeconomic status would be blunted. This is because these causes are

primarily physiological in origin and were not thought to be influenced by environmental differences. However, it was believed that the postneonatal deaths which take place between the ages of one month and one year would continue to exhibit an inverse relationship with socioeconomic status because the major causes of death at these ages (e.g., infectious diseases, accidents) are farther removed from the physiological processes of gestation and birth and are more directly related to environmental factors.
In explaining this apparent blunting of the relationship between total infant mortality and socioeconomic status, Willie and Stockwell suggested that it was due to improved public health measures and the effectiveness of improved medical techniques in fighting infectious causes of death (Stockwell, 1962), as well as to improved sanitary codes, housing regulations, and the occurrence of practically all births in hospitals (Willie, 1959). Moreover, it was anticipated that a continuation of these trends would likely promote a further blunting and perhaps even an elimination of this mortality differential. However, this does not seem to have occurred.
On the contrary, an examination of the findings and conclusions of more recent studies show that considerable confusion exists today concerning the nature of the relationship between infant mortality and its component parts to socioeconomic status. On the one hand, in a longitudinal study of Chicago between 1930 and 1960, Kitagawa and Hauser (1973) found a considerable narrowing of the socioeconomic differential in infant mortality. On the other hand, data for New York City (Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences, 1973) indicate that the traditional inverse relationship also applies to the neonatal component of infant mortality. This has been demonstrated for New

York City (1961-63) by father's occupation (Shapiro et al., 1968). It may also be noted that this relationship is not unique to the United States, but has also been observed in other industrialized lowmortality countries (National Center for Health Statistics, 1966; 1968a; 19686). Finally, in one other study of trends among states it was noted that the state data comparing the infant mortality/socioeconomic status relationship remained unchanged from 1938 to 1968 for occupation and education, while for per cent black, the relationship increased (Brooks, 19756), a finding which was contrary to expectations.
It should be obvious from the preceding discussion that the relationship between infant mortality and socioeconomic status is a topic requiring continued research. The evidence currently suggests that this relationship is markedly inverse (Brooks, 1975a, 19756; Markides and Barnes, 1977). Further, because they are due to different causes and are therefore likely to require different remedial programs, the neonatal and postneonatal components of infant mortality need to be examined separately in relation to the various socioeconomic variables to determine adequately the nature of this relationship. The aim of the present research, a longitudinal study of the relationship between infant mortality (total, neonatal and postneonatal) and selected measures of socioeconomic status in the city of Toledo, Ohio, is to present data to try to clarify some of the present confusion and to enhance our knowledge and understanding of this relationship.
Since most research in this area examined socioeconomic differentials referring to the widening or narrowing of the subgroup gap based on various measures of education, occupation, income, etc., these same studies neglected to assess the overall impact and to differentiate the socioeconomic variables that were most sensitive

to infant mortality. Specifically, the main purpose of this research is to examine the overall infant mortality/socioeconomic status relationship and to identify the variables that contributed most to infant mortality for each time period.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The present research on the relationship between the components of infant mortality and various measures of socioeconomic status employs an ecological approach. The basic unit of analysis is the census tract of mother's usual residence. In order to calculate infant and component mortality rates, infant deaths and live births for each of the same 53 census tracts centering around the years 1950, 1960, and 1970 had to be known. From the Bureau of Vital Statistics, Toledo Department of Health, data on infant deaths were collected for the periods January 1, 1949 to December 31, 1951 and January 1, 1969 to December 31, 1971. For the central census years 1950 and 1970, data on live births were collected for each tract from microfilm records. The infant deaths and live births for the period, January 1, 1959 to December 31, 1961 were obtained from data tapes provided by the Ohio Department of Health.
In calculating rates, we used the conventional procedure of relating the average number of deaths occurring during the three years for each time period covered to the number of live births in the central census year. This procedure minimizes the possible influences of chance fluctuations in the year-to-year number of infant deaths. Socioeconomic characteristics of the population in each census tract were obtained from the 1950, I960, and 1970 census of population and housing census tract statistics published by the Bureau of the Census.

status on infant mortality was the squared semipartial correlation coefficient. The semipartial correlation coefficient (sr) measures more directly the contribution of each variable to the variation of the dependent variable. In other words, it is the correlation between all of Y and Xi from which X2 has been partialled. It is a semipartial correlation since the effects of X2 have been removed from Xt but not from F. The effect of X2 is taken out only from the independent variable ATi by performing a simple linear regression of X2 on Xi, and then this residual of Xi is correlated with the dependent variable (Nie et al., 1975; Cohen and Cohen, 1975).
The semipartial correlation squared (sr2) is interpreted as the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (Y) uniquely associated with an independent variable (Xi); thus, sr2 is the increase in the squared multiple correlation (R2) when the independent variable (Xt) is added to the other independent variables (X2 · · · n). Therefore, the sr2 enables the researcher to evaluate the impact of the residualized independent variable with the total Y variance (Cohen and Cohen, 1975).

Associating independent and dependent variables in this fashion would permit an intuitive grasp of the dynamics of importance, dominance, and explanatory power of socioeconomic status on infant mortality for each of the three time periods under investigation.
RESEARCH LIMITATIONS
A limitation of ecological research involves the problem of making inferences about individual characteristics using aggregate data and commiting what is known as the "ecological fallacy." As long as one recognizes the limitations of ecological research and does not make inference from the aggregate to the individual level, ecological relationships are important, both theoretically and practically. A main advantage of such studies is that their geographic specificity provides a valuable guide to structuring local governmental programs of health care that are usually implemented on a geographic basis.
RESULTS
The three time periods under investigation yield a peculiar component percentage change for total, white, and nonwhite infant mortality as shown in Table 1. For the white population, total infant and neonatal mortality declined consistently and markedly from 1950 to 1970, while the postneonatal rate remained unchanged between 1950 and 1960 and declined only slightly between 1960 and 1970. For nonwhites, on the other hand, all rates declined markedly between 1950 and 1960, but the 1960-70 decade saw a continued neonatal decline offset by a sizeable increase in the postneonatal mortality rate. This latter increase was so great that it resulted in a slight rise in the nonwhite total infant mortality rate during the most

recent period. The exact significance of this increase is unclear, but it may reflect the increase in the number and proportion of blacks, particularly lower socioeconomic status blacks, in the Toledo population. The net effect of these trends has been an overall marked decline in overall infant mortality, and especially neonatal mortality, while the postneonatal mortality rate has risen slightly.
The component percentages shown in Table 1 are fairly consistent for the total, white, and nonwhite population from 1950 to 1960. However, the 1970 component percentages are markedly different from both 1950 and 1960 for the three population groups. The percentage of infant deaths in the postneonatal period increased from 1960 to 1970, and conversely the percentage of deaths in the neonatal period declined appreciably during this period, where 67.7 per cent and 32.3 per cent of infant deaths occurred in the neonatal and postneonatal periods for the total population, respectively, compared to 76.2 and 23.8 for the neonatal and postneonatal period in 1960.
CAUSE TYPE AND PERIOD OF DEATH
This section briefly analyzes cause and period of death for the three time periods under investigation. A two-group causetype classification was used (endogenous and exogenous).
Endogenous causes of death usually correspond to neonatal mortality (birth-1 month) because these causes are directly attributable to the birth process. Exogenous causes, on the other hand, generally correspond to postneonatal mortality (1 month through 11 months) and are usually attributable to environmental factors. The following causes of death and the corresponding cause of death codes were included in each broad endogenous and exogenous category (World Health Organization, 1957):

population in 1970. The per cent of white infant deaths occurring in the postneonatal period were 21.6, 23.9, and 29.3 in 19S0, 1960, and 1970, respectively. The per cent of infant deaths occurring in the exogenous cause type were 20.9, 22.2, and 43.7 per cent for the same years. These trends indicate by period definition that more infant deaths occurred in the postneonatal period in 1970, and by cause definition, exogenous causes had a higher percentage than the per cent of infant deaths in the postneonatal period. Exogenous causes of death were contributing to more than their share of postneonatal deaths. That is, exogenous causes of death were contributing to deaths in the neonatal period. This occurred for the total and white population but not for the nonwhite population. Thus, the white population contributed to the overall pattern in 1970.
In sum, the cause of death analysis suggested that for both the total and white populations, exogenous (postneonatal) causes, rather than endogenous causes, were increasingly contributing to neonatal deaths. In 1950 and 1960 the correspondence between per cent-component mortality and per cent-cause type were similar. In 1970 this was not the case, implying a "cross-over effect," that is, one type of component mortality was caused in part by the other mortality components cause of death. In this case, a portion of neonatal deaths were due to exogenous causes. This is what likely explains the inverse neonatal pattern and the observed widening of the overall infant mortality/ socioeconomic status differential of other recent research (Brooks, 1975a, 19756; Markides and Barnes, 1977; Adamchak and Stockwell, 1978).
These trends could be due to adverse social and economic conditions or could indicate that medical advances have prolonged and/or are prolonging the infants'

lives into the second and subsequent months (e.g., infants who would have normally died in the neonatal period have survived into and died in the postneonatal period).
THE IMPACT OF SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS
ON INFANT MORTALITY
The major aspect of this study focused on the infant mortality/socioeconomic status relationship using correlational procedures. Zero-order correlation coefficients are provided in Table 3. A comparison of the three time periods indicates that infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality have a negative relationship with those measures that are direct indicators of status (e.g., education, occupation, income, and single housing units), and a positive relationship with the remaining variables that are inverse indicators of status. Although some correlation coefficients are modest, all but three are in the predicted direction and for the most part are statistically significant at the 0.05 level. Most coefficients become increasingly stronger from 1950 to 1970, thus supporting the hypothesis of a widening socioeconomic mortality differential. The only variable that deviated from the predicted direction was female labor force participation. A negative association was predicted between infant mortality and its components and female labor force participation, but such association was found only for total infant mortality in 1950 (not significant) and for postneonatal mortality in 1950 and 1960 (significant at the 0.05 level). In 1970, however, this variable was significantly correlated in a high positive direction with all three infant mortality rates. Thus, contrary to expectations, it appears that this variable has emerged as a negative index of status; the lower the status, the higher the percentage of females who are in the labor force which coincides with the matriarchal family

were the only sr2's that were statistically significant in 1950 for total infant mortality.
In 1960, the squared semipartials were statistically significant for high school education, median income, unemployment, marital instability, and single housing units. Education and unemployment declined slightly while crowding declined from uniquely explaining 14.6 to 1 per cent of the variance in infant mortality. In 1970, housing status variables explained very little, while the economic and family status variables clearly explained most. In fact, marital instability uniquely explained 13.2 per cent of the variance in infant mortality in 1970 (sr2 = 0.132, p < 0.001). In 1960, the largest 5r2>s were dispersed throughout the three status types, and in 1970 both family and economic status were strong predictors. It was clearly evident from Table 4 that socioeconomic status accounted for more variance in infant mortality in 1960 than in 1950 and more in 1970 than in 1960.
The bottom of Table 4 shows the multiple correlation (/?) and its square (explained variance R2) for all nine variables (eight independent variables and the control variable). R2's for 1950, 1960, and 1970 explained 24.5, 34.0, and 65.7 per cent of the variance in infant mortality, respectively. The large increase from 1960 to 1970 indicates that socioeconomic status variables became more sensitive to infant mortality during that decade.
Table 4 shows that in 1950 and 1960 no clear-cut status type pattern existed for neonatal mortality. In 1950 unemployment uniquely explained the largest amount of the variance (4.6 per cent) in neonatal mortality, but it was not statistically significant. In 1960, single housing units explained 7.2 per cent (sr2 = 0.072, p < 0.05). Income and unemployment also reached the 0.05 level of significance in 1960. In 1970 for neonatal mortality,

the same five variables were significant as in total infant mortality. The family status variable, marital instability, uniquely explained 8.4 per cent of the variance, the highest in 1970. For each successive period, socioeconomic status had become more sensitive to neonatal mortality. This was also evidenced in the R2's. In 1950, 1960, and 1970 all variables taken together explained 13.5, 29.7, and 41.8 per cent of the variance in neonatal mortality.
Postneonatal mortality has traditionally been very sensitive to socioeconomic status as shown in Table 4. In 1950, all sr*'s except for marital instability and single housing units were statistically significant. Education and crowding uniquely explained 17.7 and 29.1 per cent of the variance in postneonatal mortality, respectively. In 1960, all 5r2's were significant, with income, female labor force participation, and single housing units uniquely explaining the most variance in postneonatal mortality (s^'s = 0.152, 0.128, and 0.145, respectively).
From 1960 and 1970 all sr2's declined, indicating that the individual uniqueness of each independent variable explained less variance in postneonatal mortality. However, the i?2's of all variables considered increased from 39.3 per cent in 1950 to 43.9 per cent in 1960, and finally to 49.2 per cent in 1970, thus explaining nearly half of the variance in postneonatal mortality at the most recent date. The increments in the R2's for postneonatal mortality were not as great as infant or neonatal mortality, however, indicating that the importance of this component's contribution to the infant mortality/socioeconomic status relationship had become relatively less important.
So that we may view the relationship between total infant mortality and socioeconomic status longitudinally, Figure 1 shows sr2's graphically. In 1950, crowding (housing variable) and unemployment

contribute most to infant mortality. In 1960, single housing units (housing variable) and income (economic variable) uniquely explained the most variance in infant mortality; and in 1970, marital instability (family variable) and income dominated. Marital instability (family) increased most from 1950 to 1970, and crowding (housing) had the largest decrease for the same period.
In 1970, marital instability (family variable) explained the most variance, with income (economic variable) explaining the next highest amount. Since family type variables, specifically marital instability, emerged as the dominant infant mortality explanatory variable with income placing second, it appeared in 1970 that differences in infant mortality were working through the amount of degree of family

disruption. In 1960, it appeared that infant mortality differentials worked through housing variables, and in 1950 one dominant type did not emerge which further substantiates those assertions by Willie, Stockwell, and others that infant mortality was at that time not very sensitive to differences in socioeconomic status. However, in 1960 and more so in 1970, clear-cut patterns emerge, with family status dominating in the most recent period and increasing explained variance of dominant variables for all three mortality measures.
SUMMARY, DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
First, the correlational analysis set out to determine if infant mortality and its

components had become more sensitive to socioeconomic status over the three time periods as measured by eight indicators of socioeconomic status. Secondly, it sought to identify the variables that contributed most to explained variance in total infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality. Both goals were accomplished.
Although the total infant and neonatal mortality rates declined from 1950 to 1970 in Toledo for the total and nonwhite population, and all mortality components rates declined for the white population, it was easily discernible that the increasing postneonatal rate for the total population was primarily operating through the nonwhite population. It was also discernible that socioeconomic mortality differentials as evidenced by zero-order correlation coefficients successively widened from 19S0 to 1970, and the overall widening differential resulted from an increasing neonatal differential.
The major findings of the cause-ofdeath analysis were the "cause-period cross-over effect," and the changing percentage of infant deaths in each mortality component. That is, in 1970 postneonatal causes (exogenous) were contributing to neonatal deaths, perhaps indicating that the population of Toledo has experienced adverse social and economic conditions where infants in the neonatal period were expiring from infectious and accidental causes. Also interacting is the fact that a higher percentage of infant deaths were occurring in the postneonatal period in 1970 than in 1950 or 1960. This could simply indicate that declining social and economic conditions increased the per cent in the postneonatal component, or that a more complex mechanism is operating as advances in medicine are prolonging the life of the infant. Infants who normally would have died in the first month of life (neonatal period) may have survived into the second and subsequent months, thus

increasing the postneonatal percentage component.
Using squared semipartial correlation coefficients between socioeconomic type variables and total infant mortality as well as its separate components identified the socioeconomic status influence on the type of mortality. From 1950 to 1970, total infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality converge into a consistent socioeconomic pattern. In 1950, crowding (housing variable) was the dominant variable for total infant mortality. For neonatal mortality, unemployment dominated, and economic status variables and crowding (housing variable) emerged as influencing postneonatal mortality suggesting that in 1950 the postneonatal component influenced total infant mortality much more than neonatal mortality.
In 1960, single housing units and income, in that order, were the dominant variables that emerged as the most sensitive predictors for total infant mortality.
For neonatal mortality in 1960, income, unemployment, and single housing units dominated and for postneonatal mortality all eight indicators were significant. This indicates that although not perfectly consistent, both neonatal and postneonatal mortality were beginning to coincide in explaining the infant mortality/socioeconomic status relationship. However, postneonatal mortality was still stronger. This convergence was also observed in the total R2's which indicated that neonatal mortaility was gaining in explained variance.
In 1970, marital instability (family status) and income (economic status) emerged for all three mortality rates. This convergence was also acknowledged in 1970 with the postneonatal total Rz being only modestly higher than the R2 for neonatal mortality instead of more than three times as large in 1950. This suggests that in 1970, family status, and specifically
