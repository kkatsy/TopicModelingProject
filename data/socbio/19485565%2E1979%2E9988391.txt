ABSTRACT: We report a significant pole-to-equator gradient in fatal congenital defects of the central nervous system whose rates increase directly with increasing latitudes in either hemisphere of the American continent. This gradient was not observed in deaths due to malformations of other organ systems and is in the opposite direction to the well-recognized one between latitude and childhood mortality.

An opportunity for studying possible associations between latitude and birth defects was provided by an internationally sponsored ten-country investigation of childhood mortality conducted by fifteen collaborating groups in widely scattered areas of the American continent (Puffer and Serrano, 1973; Munan, 1973). Interlaboratory comparability was achieved because differences in data collection, case ascertainment and diagnostic criteria between areas were minimized by procedures described below.
For eight of the fifteen areas selected for this analysis, longitude varied less than 8°while latitude varied widely (78°). Since the basis for selection of study areas was interest and willingness of researchers to participate rather than their geographic location, the shape of the study area as a narrow swath extending over about half of the distance between poles was entirely fortuitous (Figure 1). It is also important to underscore that the objective of the collaborative investigation was to study childhood mortality, not to test the

strength of latitude or longitude relationships to disease distributions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The field inquiry began with the identification of death certificates of children under five years of age dying during a two-year period in each area listed in Table 1 and continued with a review of clinical and autopsy records and with household interviews. The investigation thus excluded stillbirths. Data on pertinent circumstances surrounding each death were entered onto pretested and standardized questionnaires and examined in each area by a group of pediatricians, obstetricians, pathologists, and epidemiologists with a view to ascribing an accurate cause of death.
All data collected on approximately 37,100 childhood deaths (of which 27,600 were infants under one year of age) were again reviewed centrally by a separate expert group appointed by the Pan American Health Organization/World Health

Expressions of cause-specific infant mortality rates usually have as the denominator the number of live births. In the cities under study, birth registration varied in the degree of completeness. In several areas additional birth data were obtained by examining hospital and baptismal records and estimating the number of home deliveries from midwives and similar sources (Puffer and Serrano, 1973).
Mortality rates are assembled in Table 1 and classified by the degree of latitude of each area under study. They are analyzed for significance of pole-to-equator gradients in either hemisphere using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. This nonparametric statistic provides a useful approximation for estimating concomitant variations in small series. As used here, the geographic areas are ranked from 1 to 8 as you move from lowest to highest death rates and from lowest to highest latitude. Spearman's formula follows:

where d is the difference between two ranks and n is the number of pairs of observation.

Organization. The procedure assured consistency in the application of criteria to define principal and associated causes for each death and thereby reduced bias due to differences in diagnostic practices among study areas.
The following are the criteria used for inclusion of data in this analysis: (1) congenital defects leading to death during the first year of life; (2) congenital defects diagnosed as the underlying cause of death; and (3) deaths occuring in urban centers situated in a narrow north-south band less than 10°wide.

Death rates due to all congenital defects combined did not have well-defined hemispheric clines, nor did those due separately to congenital malformations of the circulatory system, of the digestive system, or to mongolism. (Table 1). Only birth defects of the central nervous system had a statistically significant latitudinal gradient (r = 0.79), with rates diminishing as the equator was approached from either pole.
Rates for congenital defects of organ systems other than those specified above, consisting mostly of malformations of re-

spiratory, musculo-skeletal, or genitourinary systems are combined and listed under "Other" in Table 1. These also showed significant latitude associations. This gradient, however, was based upon two fewer rates than the others, and at the same time the dates were also less reliable due to lower frequency of occurrence.
Of note in Table 1 is the well-known correlation between high childhood mortality and low latitudes. The direction of this correlation is opposite to that noted for the relationship of fatal nervous system anomalies to latitude.

It would be unproductive to regard the significant gradients in congenital defects of the central nervous system as odd observations simply because no ready explanation becomes apparent. To view them as reflections of more general poleto-equator mortality gradients is contrary to known facts, and to ascribe them to differentials in diagnostic practices would also be unrewarding. As stated, other congenital defects more difficult to diagnose than malformations of the nervous system do not show clines (Table 1).
Several studies dealing with the relationship between latitudes and congenital malformations have appeared. One, based on world-wide data, supports the hypothesis that the earth's geomagnetic fields and cosmic rayflux, differing in intensity as you move away from the poles, are importantly associated with the distribution of fatal congenital malformations of any type (Wesley, 1960). A study by Alter (1963) found that a more northern community had significantly higher incidence of anencephalic births than a more southern one in the North American hemisphere.
Reports on variations in anencephaly and spina bifida with longitude have also

been reported and reviewed (Hewitt, 1963; Elwood 1976). Longitudinal disease-specific patterns in North America are described, showing the incidence of anencephaly, spina bifida, and hydrocephalus declining from east to west with no difference or increase.in other kinds of malformation. Geographic variations in anencephaly interpretable in part by human migrations, mineral content of water, cosmic radiation and other factors have been more recently analyzed and discussed (Elwood, 1977, 1979; Archer 1979).
This paper cannot fully examine and explain the latitude dependency of deaths due to defects in structures arising out of the neural tube. A more detailed sociobiologic and environmental assessment would be needed, focusing on the role of maternal age, parity, and nutrition; of birth rank of the newborn; of socioeconomic, ethnic, genetic, and environmental variables of the family; and especially of incidences of congenital defects in aborted fetuses.
A suggestion was proffered on the nature of the correlation of central nervous system birth defects with latitude, namely,
