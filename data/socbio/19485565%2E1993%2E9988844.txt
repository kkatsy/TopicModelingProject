ABSTRACT: Mexico has a large and rapidly growing labor force. This paper projects the Mexican national labor force from 1980 to 2005, with varying assumptions of vital rates, economic activity, and international migration. Projections are also made for the urban and rural components of the Mexican population, assuming inter-component migration flows. Results indicate that the Mexican labor force will grow over the projection period at an average annual rate of 907,000 to 1,183,000 workers; will age slightly; and will have a much higher proportion female. Implications are discussed in terms of Mexican-U.S. migration, possible agreements on free trade, and global trends in workforce.

The Mexican population has grown substantially in the twentieth century, from a level of 25.8 million in 1950 (SPP, 1955) to a level of 69.7 million in 1980 (Nunez and Moreno, 1986) and to a preliminary census estimate of 81.1 million in 1990 (Population Reference Bureau, 1990).' Mexico's population growth in the 1970's and 1980's slowed, as fertility rates dropped. For example, Mexico's Total Fertility Rate (TFR) dropped from 6.5 in 1970 (Nunez and Moreno, 1982) to 3.8 in 1989 (Population Reference Bureau, 1989) and to a medium estimate of 3.4 for 1990 (Camposortega, 1989). However, since fertility decline exerts a delayed effect on reducing population growth (Keyfitz, 1971), decline or levelling of the total Mexican population is not expected to occur until the second quarter of the twenty-first century.
1This preliminary Mexican census national total is controversial and undergoing discussions and debate (Population Reference Bureau, 1990). By comparison, earlier totals projected for 1990 included 86.7 million for 1989 (Population Reference Bureau, 1989) and 85.8 million for 1990 (SPP, 1988).

In the period 1940-80, the Mexican national labor force increased rapidly, at a rate roughly proportional to the period's rapid population growth (Alba, 1984¿>). Economically active population increased from 5.9 million in 1940 to 22.1 million in 1980 (SPP, 1985). During this period, the Mexican economy demonstrated the capacity to absorb most of this massive increase in labor supply. However, since 1980, signs of decreasing ability to do so are apparent. For instance, one indicator of labor oversupply is the large number of Mexican undocumented migrants flowing to and residing in the United States. In the 1980's the latter number was estimated in the range of 1.5-3.5 million (Levine et al., 1985; see also Bean et al., 1983), with 100,000 to 200,000 net migrants estimated as entering the United States from Mexico every year (Heer, 1979; Espenshade, 1990). An estimate postdating the 1988 U.S. Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) indicates a total of 1.01 million undocumented migrants

resident in the United States in 1989,of which 0.83 million were born in Mexico (Woodrow, 1990). Labor oversupply is also reflected in the recent growth of the informal labor force in Mexico. Informal labor force is defined as a labor force that is nonsalaried, underemployed, often temporary, and employed at organizations that are not legally constituted (Anderson, 1988; DeSoto, 1989).
Economic problems are often associated with oversupply of labor, including unemployment, underemployment, and reduction in salary levels. In the 1980's and continuing into the 1990's, Mexican economic problems have been major, involving a huge national debt, currently devaluation, and lack of competitiveness. Labor oversupply was partly overshadowed by these other problems.
In the early 1990's, there is the serious prospect of the signing of a North American Free Trade Agreement that would ease restrictions of flows of trade and labor between Canada, the United States, and Mexico. If passed, such a multifaceted agreement would likely increase employment opportunities in Mexico, contributing to reduced flowsof low skilled labor from Mexico to the United States. This would relieve some of the problems of growing labor oversupply inside Mexico and help improve the Mexican economy. At the same time, migration pull factors in the United States may be enhanced by a Free Trade Agreement, in order to relieve sectoral labor shortages in the United States.
Some of the changes anticipated for the Mexican labor force are reflective of trends in the global labor force, including the development of young,

increasingly educated, and mobile workforces in developing nations parallel with the aging of the workforce in advanced nations. This study will examine projected Mexican changes in light of expected worldwide change and will identify similarities and differences.
Changes in the Mexican labor force over the past fifty years provide a backdrop for considering the present situation. From 1940 to 1960, the Mexican economy was mostly prosperous, with the labor force approximately doubling from 5.9 to 11.3 million persons. This labor force increase was absorbed about evenly between the agricultural arid nonagricultural sectors of the economy (Alba, 1984a). Agricultural labor demand increased due to expansion in cultivable land area and slow growth in mechanization. During this period, the urban proportion of the population increased from 37 per cent to 51 per cent, and growth in the urban sector offered numerous new jobs that accommodated the larger labor supply without adverse effects.
Beginning in the mid-60's, major changes impacted the national labor force situation. First, the agricultural sector of the economy stabilized, and from 1960 to 1980 the agricultural labor force increased by only 14 per cent compared to a 140 per cent increase in the nonagricultural labor force. The overall labor force increased from 11.3 to 22.1 million persons.
Another change in recent decades has been the substantial growth in the informal labor force. This phenomenon is reflected in the 30 per cent of the economically active population having an unspecified occupation in the 1980 Census of Population (Rendon and

Salas, 1986). The informal labor force is difficult to estimate, and few research studies have looked into it. Anderson (1988) identified socioeconomic correlates of the informal labor force in the northern border region as measured by the following proxy variables from pooled data for the 1950-80 censuses: (1) the proportion of economically active population in the insufficiently specified category and (2) the per cent of economically active workers earning less than the legal minimum wage. She ascertained several factors which predicted the extent of the informal labor force including rural-urban minimum wage differentials and female labor force participation.
Another change in the period 1940-80 has been a major rise in female economic activity, as seen in Table 1. Female labor force participation increased dramatically over the forty years, although it slowed during the decade of the 1960's. The growing female economic activity is associated with increased educational attainment of the Mexican population, reduced childbearing, and changes in family norms regarding female work (Kasarda et al., 1986; Pick et al., I989a,b).
Several studies have estimated the net migration flows of labor force, largely undocumented, from Mexico to the United States (Heer, 1979; Espenshade, 1990; Woodrow et al., 1990). One estimate put the annual netflowof undocumented population at 82,000 to 232,400 for 1970-75 (Heer, 1979). More recently, the annual flow of undocumented population from Mexico to the U.S. was estimated at 115,000 for the 1979-86 period (Woodrow et al., 1987). Espenshade (1990) cites an

annual increase of 190,000 in the early 1980's for net Mexican undocumented population resident in the United States, plus an annual flow of 85,000 legal Mexican migrants. However, few studies have examined the MexicanU.S. migration flows in terms of labor supply, i.e., utilizing models that take into account the internal Mexican labor supply.
One study examining labor supply and demand for the entire Caribbean Basin concluded that the economies of Mexico and the Caribbean countries would be unlikely to provide enough jobs to keep up with labor supply (Espenshade, 1990). An implication of this imbalance is pressure for increased migration from Mexico to the U.S. The Espenshade study was based on labor force projections done in the mid 80's by the International Labour Office (ILO, 1986). Garcia y Griego's cohortcomponent multiregional projection of Mexico's labor force assumed two regimes of migration from Mexico to the United States for 1990-2010: a medium one assuming annual net migration to the United States at 190,000 per year and a "drastic change" regime with annual net migration of 400,000 per year (Garcia y Griego, 1989). The study speculated that the supply of migrants from Mexico to the United States in the 1990's would be determined much more by the economies and population dynamics of the two countries than by the consequences of implementing IRCA (Garcia y Griego, 1989).
The Garcia y Griego study differs greatly from the present research in its projection methodology and assumptions. Major distinctions include the following: (1) Garcia y Griego projects

total population and concentrates on the increases in total population of Mexicans resident in the United States. (2) He disaggregates the projection by three regions, one consisting of Mexican citizens resident in the United States. By contrast, we project only for population resident in Mexico. (3) His assumed fertility rates are about 12-17 per cent higher than those in the present study, since he adopted middecade rates from the Mexican census (1985), rather than the lower revised rates of Camposortega (1989), based on a later survey. His study focuses on emigration of population from Mexican regions as a source of U.S. labor supply (without actually estimating labor force based on economic activity rates), whereas the present study focuses on the much larger Mexican internal population and labor force.
The present study projects the Mexican labor force supply for the period 1980-2005. It has the following objectives: (1) to estimate the age-specific Mexican labor force for 1980-2005 based on assumed regimes of fertility, mortality, rates of economic activity, net international migration, and Mexican internal urban-rural migration flows; (2) to project similarly the urban and rural labor force components;
(3) to describe the age-sex distribu-

tions and average age of total, urban, and rural workforces; (4) to evaluate changes in sex composition of the labor force, under varying assumptions; (5) to analyze the consequences of changes in the age structure of the labor force, including making comparisons relative to the United States; and (6) to discuss implications of the findings in terms of the two nations' economies and international migration policies, Mexico's population control policy, prospects for a North American Free Trade Agreement, and trends in the global workforce. The present research expands existing literature by estimating the components of projected Mexican labor force--in particular, age, sex, and urban/rural components--and by analyzing binational and global implications of changes forecast in components.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The labor force projections are based on standard methodology which first performs a cohort-component population projection and then multiplies by age-specific economic activity rates (Shryock and Siegel, 1976). The population projections are made utilizing mortality rates, which are assumed to decrease for the projection period,

and Low, Medium, and High regimes of declining fertility rates. Projections are done for the entire nation, as well as for the urban and rural segments. Urban and rural projections incorporate fertility rates, which are assumed to differ between urban and rural population segments, and age-specific rural-to-urban and urban-to-rural migration flows, which are postulated to vary over the projection period.
A Medium and a High regime of age-, sex-specific economic activity rates are assumed, both of which change over the projection period. Economic activity rates are postulated not to vary between the urban and rural segments of the population.
Also incorporated in the projection mode are two regimes of net international migration. Low Regime allows for a fixed volume of net international emigration from Mexico of 100,000per year. In accord with historical trends, nearly all of this flow is to the United States. The 100,000 figure corresponds to the 82,000 lower bound of estimated annual net emigration flow from Mexico to the United States of undocumented migrants (Heer, 1979). It approximates half of the 225,000 volume of annual net emigrants assumed by recent official Mexican census projections (SPP, 1988).
The High Regime of international migration assumes a linear increase from 115,000 annual net emigrants in 1980-84 to 175,000 in 1990-94 and to 235,000 in 2000-04. From 1990 onwards, the High Regime approximates the Mexican census's figure of 225,000, but is less than Espenshade's estimate of 275,000 for the early 1980's. It should be noted that, for the 1980's, the High Regime is less than Heer's up-

per value of 232,000 for 1970-75. By comparison, the present Lowand High migration regimes have levels of emigration about half those postulated by Garcia y Griego (1989). However, his high regime (termed "drastic change") is intended to explore the maximum possible upper bounds, whereas the present high regime is intended to be more within the bounds of existing literature and government estimates.
The set of projection regimes for Total Population is summarized in Table 2. The Urban set of projection regimes is analogous to that for Total Population, and is labelled UlMa, UIMb, . . . U2Hc. Likewise, the Rural set is similar and labelled RlMa, RIMb, . . . R2Hc. Overall, there are three sets of twelve projection regimes for a total of 36 projections. Theprojection software was written in FORTRAN and based partly on modified standard FORTRAN life table and population projection routines (Keyfitz and Flieger, 1971). An updated PYRAMID computer graphics program was used to examine age structures (Pick, 1974).

For U.S. males age 20-54, the patterns remained nearly constant over fifty years, while showing about 5-6 times as much "tapering," compared to Mexico, at the youngest (15-19) and oldest (65 + ) age groups.

Also, for the United States historically, social security advances and retirement benefits led to a very sharp decline in economic activity rates at retirement age, much more than is hypothesized 1980-2005 for Mexico, a nation which almost certainly cannot afford such social welfare benefits. For women, the comparison of the Mexican 1980-2005 projected High Regime with the United States, 1930-83 shows that, in both instances, initial rates for

ages 25-64 commenced at about the same level. Over the period, however, Mexican rates are assumed to grow about 50 per cent more than for the United States historically. This assumption is partially attributable to the expected increase in the maquiladora and tourism industries, which rely heavily upon female labor. The potential impact of a Free Trade Agreement remains unknown. For retirement ages

(65 + ), rates for both nations remain constant, while rates for age group 20-24 show a similar increase for both countries. For the late teens (age 1619), the rates cannot be compared, since the U.S. data for 1930 and 1940 are subject to unusual definitions (Bogue, 1985). In summary, key transitional features of steadiness in male rates and sharp rise in female rates are similar between the historical U.S.

economically active population of between 2.01 to 2.36 times. Such growth corresponds to 2.79 and 3.43 per cent annual rates of workforce growth respectively. These rates of increase are much higher than projected population growth rates, which vary from 1.39 per cent annually for the Low Fertility regime to 2.04 per cent for High Fertility. At the same time, the nonworking or "dependent" population will grow

more slowly than the whole population.
The projected growth in labor force gender components varies considerably by regime. Male growth ratios over 25 years vary from 1.84 to 2.00 times, while female growth ratios range from 2.45 to 3.32 times. It is important to emphasize that the projected growth ratios for the male labor force lag somewhat the entire popula-

tion, whereas the female growth ratio is much higher. Under the strongest assumptions, it rises two-thirds more than the ratio for the male labor force. The faster growth in female labor force is the direct result of assumed rapidly rising female economic activity rates, versus steady rates for males.
The sex ratio of the initial labor force in 1980 undergoes lowering, for all forecast regimes. The sex ratio of

the Mexican labor force in 1980 was 267, implying nearly three quarters of the workforce were men. By the year 2005, the projected sex ratio of the labor force falls to about 197 for the medium economic activity rate regime, while it falls to about 159 for the high economic activity rate series. The latter case points to males' comprising only 60 per cent of the workforce. This major change in sex composition of the

AGE STRUCTURAL EFFECTS
The projections imply large shifts in the age structure of the population and the labor force. Generally, there is an aging of the population and workforce, and an increasing feminization of the workforce. Examples of age structural effects of the projections are displayed in Figures 7 and 8. The age structural results discussed for these two figures also apply to the other regimes, for which figures are not shown due to space constraints. As seen in Figure 7, the total population age pyramid shifts from triangular-shaped in 1980 to diamond-shaped in 2005, with the greatest width for the 30-34 age group. There is an absolute decrease for children under 15, and a very large increase in the prime labor force ages of 20-59. Overall, there is radical transformation in age distribution, with an emphasis on "economically active" over "dependent" age groups.
For the medium economic activity regime shown in Figure 8, the labor force age structural change is greater for women than men. For instance, the female age groups 30-59 undergo especially rapid growth, tripling or quadrupling in absolute size over the projection period. However, it is also apparent that the absolute effects on the male working age groups are very large. For both sexes, age distributional effects are least under age 20 and in the retirement ages. Overall, there are remarkable increases of women as opposed to men in the labor force.

PROJECTION OF RURAL AND URBAN
POPULATION
Projections were also carried out for rural and urban population components to assess differential rural and urban labor force impacts. Urban and rural segments in the projections were accomplished for the following reasons: (1) In Mexico there have been important differences in vital rates between the urban and rural segments of the population. These differences are especially important for fertility, where rates are assumed to be more than 60 per cent higher in rural versus urban areas (see Table 3). Disaggregation also allows differences to be incorporated between rural and urban mortality rates. (2) Differences in labor force supply pressures in rural versus urban areas are important to ascertain for policy makers, since the demand side of the job market is quite different in rural and urban areas.
The projection methodology utilized was the same as applied for the total population, except that, at each five-year projection iteration, an age vector of postulated numbers of net rural/urban migrants was added to, or subtracted from, projected urban and rural populations. The specific assumptions of the rural/urban projections are as follows.
(1) Mortality. --As in the case of aggregated population, mortality is assumed to decline steadily during the projection. Mortality rates are assumed to be higher in rural than in urban areas. Based on estimates of Nunez and Moreno (1986), the difference between urban and rural life expectancies is assumed to be constant

identical, and the postulated fertility rates in the overall projection are equal to the average of those postulated for rural and urban projections. The rural and urban projections result in a 68 per cent urban labor force in the year 2005, which is similar to the initial 71 per cent urban labor force in 1980. The steadiness in per cent urban is explained by the offsetting influences of positive net migration flow from rural to urban areas and higher rural versus urban fertility.
The projected number of urban economically active population in year 2005 ranges from 32 million to 37 million, which compares to a total labor force in 1980 of 22 million. The projected rural economically active population in the year 2005 ranges between 14 and 17 million. As in the case of Total Population projections, the sex ratio of the labor force is higher for the medium economic activity regime compared to the high economic activity regime. The explanation is simply that the high economic activity regime emphasizes a more sizeable increase in female economic activity rates and hence in the magnitude of the female workforce. Also, the female labor force component increases relatively more for the rural than for urban projections. This result reflects the synergistic effect of higher rural fertility and higher initial labor force sex ratio in the rural sector.
The average annual increases in the labor force, by rural and urban sectors, are shown in Table 7. It is clear that the high fertility assumptions lead to a greater increase in the female component of the labor force, that is, relatively more young female workers will be entering the labor force toward the

end of the projection period, under the high fertility assumptions.
In evaluating changes in age structure, we find the rural labor force has substantial change, especially for females but also for males, and especially in the age groups 20-39. This change is the result of higher rural fertility, combined with increasing female labor force participation. It should be noted that some of the age structural effects are the result of assumed rural-tourban net migration flows.
DISCUSSION
Labor force projections for Mexico imply that the national labor force grew substantially in the 1980's and will undergo a huge increase over the next fifteen years. This increase is due to several fundamental factors. The first is an initial age structure in 1980 that is very heavily weighted toward the younger ages. In fact, 15 per cent of the 1980 Mexican population was under ten years of age. As these populous young cohorts of 1980 enter the labor force ages, they will contribute a major increment to the labor force. Coupled with this fertility-based cause is a second fundamental factor, the substantial increase in female labor force participation rates postulated over the 25year period. This phenomenon is equal or perhaps larger in magnitude than the first effect. Together, they are likely to bring about such a large labor force that the Mexican economy, weakened substantially in the 1980's, will have a difficult challenge providing enough jobs to accommodate new workers. Indeed, it may be unable to do so, unless the Mexican economy strengthens greatly and/or trade and

investment programs grow substantially with the United States and/or other developed nations.
Under current projection assumptions, the impact of differential fertility rates for 1980-2005 is overshadowed by the impact of differential economic activity rates. The reason is that fertility differentials will take 15 to 20 years to have an effect, since the newly born must grow up to working age. In Mexico, another trend in the twentieth century has been very substantial educational advance (Pick et al., 1989). As

an offshoot of expected continuing educational progress, it is likely that the age of entry into the economically active population will increase, since added school demands will compete with job entry. Hence, it is only toward the end of the 25-year projection period that variation in fertility assumptions will have any influence.
Thus, high and low economic activity regimes exert a larger influence than do fertility regimes on the size and sex composition of the Mexican national labor force. In these projections,

184

the relative range between high and low regimes of economic activity is 11 per cent, as compared to a relative range between high and low fertility regimes of 4 per cent. Yet, the forecasts of future economic activity rates are perhaps riskier to make than those for fertility rates. One policy implication is that the Mexican government should continually monitor economic activity changes over the next 15 years, not only through the decennial census, but also by special, more frequent surveys.
Another important dimension of change in the projected labor force is a slight aging. In particular, the proportion of the labor force under age 35 is projected to lower than 59 per cent in 1980 to 51-54 per cent in the year 2005. This modest aging preserves the relative youth of the Mexican labor force, both on a worldwide basis and even more so compared to the United States. The U.S. labor force is forecast to have only 38 per cent of workers under age 35 in 2005 (Johnston, 1991).
The youthfulness of Mexico's workforce, versus its U.S. counterpart, has important ramifications. First, a young Mexican workforce should be more geographically mobile. The observation is based on a variety of migration studies, which point to young adulthood as a positive migratory factor (CEED, 1970; Bowles et al., 1975; Bogue, 1985). A second implication is that the youthfulness of legal Mexican migrant workers in the United States will lead to lowering of the salary and benefit burden on U.S. employer firms.As a result, American businesses will be more favorably inclined toward easing migration barriers. Within Mexico, the workforce's youthfulness, coupled with its anticipated rising edu-

cational level, will encourage a very strong and competitive workforce, compared to other developing nations (see Johnston, 1991).
The effect of the projected massive increase in the Mexican national labor force has implications for the United States and for other nations in North America, including Canada. First, the Mexican economy in its current weakened state is unlikely to be able to absorb the very large projected labor force. Therefore, it is likely that migratory pressure will increase from Mexico to the United States, regardless of the immigration legalities and government policies in effect, including free trade initiatives. This pressure is heightened by relatively small projected increases in the U.S. labor force. For example, one projection of the U.S. labor force indicates it will grow from 106 million in 1980 to a level of 138 million in 2005, increasing by 32 million (Bogue, 1985; see also Johnston, 1991). This figure compares to growth in the Mexican labor force, 1980-2005, of 23-26 million under the medium economic activity regime and 28-31 million under the high economic activity regime. Hence, the Mexican national labor force is likely to increase from 1980 to 2005 by roughly the same amount as the U.S. national labor force. It is important to note also that the U.S. workers added over the period will be substantially more educated and skilled than their Mexican counterparts. Thus, pressures will grow in the lower-skilled segments of the U.S. labor markets to tap the large volume of unskilled Mexican laborers.
The Mexican economy, although in disarray for part of the 1980's, is starting to recover in the 1990's under the

Vol. 40, No. 3-4

new economic policies of the Salinas administration. Under improved conditions, Mexico's economy may demonstrate increased labor demand, which can absorb some of the increased labor supply.
Espenshade (1989) -projected the following demand levels for Mexican labor in 2005: 36.5 million under low job growth assumptions, 40.7 million under medium job growth assumptions, and 60.5 million under high job growth assumptions. The present projected labor force supply of 45-53 million substantially exceeds the low and medium demand forecasts, but falls below the high demand forecast. Hence, based on Espenshade's estimates, under the most likely circumstances, the Mexican economy will be unable to absorb the anticipated huge increase in economically active persons.
It is possible that the U.S. government will not ease, but will even tighten migration policies. Without an international outlet, the large labor oversupply inside Mexico will lead to rising unemployment and underemployment, including increases in the informal labor force. This outcome would inevitably lead to a lowering in the national standard of living (Rendon and Salas, 1987) and possibly social and political unrest.
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), being considered by the United States, Mexico, and Canada is an important but unpredictable political factor which could affect the bases of the labor force projections (Grayson, 1991;Ellard, 1991). NAFTA was initiated by Presidents Salinas de Gotari and Bush, starting in mid-1990, and has garnered substantial legislative and popular support on both

sides of the border, while also raising opposition, especially from organized labor, agricultural and environmental interests, as well as from potentially impacted business sectors, such as textiles (Butler and Pick, 1991). At this writing, the final decision has not yet been made on NAFTA, although even if the present treaty fails, another attempt at a free-trade agreement may be in the offing. The potential impact of NAFTA for the current study is that it would lift economic barriers to investment and trade for the United States, Mexico, and Canada, which, in turn, could lead to changes in industrial development and labor migration across the border in both directions (Ellard, 1991). Also, the NAFTA presumably would affect patterns of internal migration, especially in Mexico.
The potential effects of NAFTA on the present labor force projections include: (1) changes in rates of net U.S.Mexico international migration, (2) alterations in economic activity rates in Mexico, and (3) differential effects on the age-sex distribution of international migrants and of economically active population. The effect on international migration would depend, among other things, on the extent and location of U.S. business investment in Mexico. Sizeable U.S. industrial investment in Mexico might occur, in the expectation of cheap labor and fewer pollution and other regulations. Such a situation would be likely to reduce Mexican migration flows to the United States since more jobs would be created in Mexico. On the other hand, there might be small reverse flows of U.S. managerial and technical workers to Mexico. International migration rates might be expected to equal or exceed those in

186

the High Regime. If there were substantial U.S. investment in industries in Mexico, economic activity rates would likely increase somewhat. However, other determinants of economic activity, including education, welfare benefits, and social norms for retirement, might not be affected. Finally, effects on the age-sex distributions of international migration and economic activity would likely be influenced by changes in the type of jobs available to future Mexican migrants to the United States, as well as by the extent of new jobs created by U.S. industry in Mexico. These effects are tied to patterns of industrial development and associated educational/skills requirements in hiring.
In summary, the possible passage of NAFTA or another free-trade agreement is a very important but complex factor affecting Mexican labor force projections. Potential effects depend on what form such legislation takes, what capital investments are made in Mexico, which industries are most affected, and the time pattern of the unfolding of the agreement.
In many aspects, the prospective Mexican and binational labor problems mirror those of the global labor force in the 1990's. It is important to examine how typical is the MexicanU.S. situation compared to the world situation and to determine the extent of differences.
There are strong similarities between the local and global situations in the relative volumes of workforce growth, the potential of increased work participation of women and greater youthfulness of workforces in the developing world, and strong pressures for international labor migration.

A recent projection indicates that, between 1985 and 2000, the global workforce will increase by 588 million (27 per cent), but that nearly all of the increase (542 million) will be in developing nations (Johnston, 1991). Although women comprise about onethird of the present global workforce, female labor force participation is much higher in developed nations than in developing ones (59 per cent versus 49 per cent in the late 80's; see Johnston, 1991). This gap implies that developing nations have a large capacity for increases in female participation rates, i.e., that the labor force in the developing world will receive an added boost from the closing of the gender
gapThe advanced world in the mid 80's
had a much older work force than the developing world. Forty seven per cent of the advanced nations' workforce was under 34 years of age in 1985 versus 61 per cent for developing nations. In global workforce projections, the absolute percentage difference is forecast to remain constant at 16 per cent during the 1990's (Johnston, 1991). Hence, the developing world is characterized by a younger, more energetic workforce. For the world, there appears to be increasing pressures for migration from developing to advanced nations, due to the comparatively greater size and youth and the increasing educational levels of the workforce in the developing, compared to the developed, world (Johnston, 1991).
The Mexican-U.S. situation largely parallels the global situation. However, in several aspects, the local situation differs, with the differences tending to increase the labor force pressures between the two countries. First, for

Vol. 40, No. 3-4

the world as a whole, there are substantial transportation barriers between developing and advanced nations, although modern transport somewhat moderates this problem. However, for Mexico and the United States there is little transport barrier. Second, the gender gap in female labor force participation is much greater between the United States and Mexico than between the developed and developing nations as a whole. Specifically, in 1986, the difference between the United States and Mexico in gender gap in labor force participation was 35 per cent versus 10 per cent for the world as a whole. This figure implies that Mexican and U.S. workforce growth rates will diverge more than global rates between developing and advanced nations. This divergence will tend to accentuate the pressure for international migration. In addition, the Mexican labor force is considerably more educated than that of the developing world as a whole. For instance, in 1986, 7 per cent of the college-age population were in college in developing nations, while the figure for Mexico was 16 per cent. Another indicator is that Mexico produced the world's sixth largest number of engineering graduates (UN, 1988). This relatively high and increasing educational level of Mexican workers is another positive factor, both for movement of Mexican workers to the United States and establishment of U.S. industrial plants in Mexico.
CONCLUSIONS
This paper projected the Mexican national labor force from 1980 to 2005 under varying scenarios consisting of

three regimes of fertility, two regimes of economic activity, and two regimes of international migration. Mortality rates were assumed to decline gradually over the 25 years. In addition, separate urban and rural projections were performed. The major results of the paper are as follows.
1. The Mexican national labor force is expected to increase substantially over the 25-year period, at least doubling. The labor force will increase from 1990 to 2005 in the range of 41 to 58 per cent.
2. Annual increases in the Mexican labor force will be substantial, averaging about one million new economically active individuals per year.
3. A critical component in the resulting labor force size and composition is female economic activity rates. If these rates follow historical rates of increase, it is likely that in 2005, the national labor force will be about 40 per cent female and will include about 16-20 million economically active women--not much less than the total size of the Mexican labor force in 1980. The increasing work role for women in Mexico will change the role of women in society and is likely to contribute to empowering women as a greater political force.
4. The Mexican labor force will age slightly over the projection period. However, it will still be a young labor force in 2005 by worldwide standards, with about half of workers under age 35.
5. Rural and urban projections indicate that the rural and urban labor force proportions will be maintained at about current levels. However, labor force pressures are likely to be greater on the rural labor markets, as they

188

have lower potential for job growth. The rural pressures will likely be greater for females than for males, implying the likelihood of higher rural-tourban migration rates for females.
6. A free trade agreement between Mexico and the United States would influence many aspects of labor force growth in Mexico--including international migration and rates of economic activity--and the job market in both nations. The complex effects would be a function of the exact form of the agreement, resultant industrial development and investment patterns, and the timing of free trade events.
7. The structure of Mexican-U.S. labor forces and interaction in many ways will mirror worldwide patterns of lowering of trade barriers and international migration barriers and increase in labor flows across national borders. The logical match between developing nations' younger, larger, increasingly educated workforces and developed nations' growing labor needs applies also to Mexico and the United States. In the U.S.-Mexico case, this match is accentuated further by high wage rates and educational opportunities in the United States, relatively high educational levels in Mexico, and large starting differences between the two nations' gender gaps in economic activity.
8. The present study points to a growing labor problem in Mexico that

will potentially affect the nation's standard of living, the career satisfactions and successes of its workers, and relations with neighboring countries, especially the United States. The outcome within Mexico can be influenced by Mexican government policy. The government would benefit by stepped-up surveying of labor force trends. Government policy has started to recognize the problem with the Salinas administration free trade initiatives, but many more policy initiatives are needed. In the United States, both the Bush and Clinton administrations have recognized the importance of the growing Mexican labor force. The U.S. government, however, needs to continue to address these problems, whether or not a free trade agreement passes, because the pressures being created need resolutions that will be beneficial to both nations through pro-active and enlightened policies.
