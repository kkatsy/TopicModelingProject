ABSTRACT: A representative random sample of 11,628 rural couples and 8,998 urban couples from North Arcot District of Tamil Nadu in South India are under follow up since 1969 in a study of inbreeding eflFects. This paper describes the level of inbreeding and its relationship to religion of the couples. Wright's F for autosomal genes in the rural and urban areas were 0.0371 and 0.0205, respectively. The F for sex-linked genes was significantly higher than that for autosomal and was 0.0411 in the rural areas and 0.0228 in the urban. Hindus had the highest inbreeding coefficients as compared to Muslims or Christians for both autosomal and sex-linked genes, but there were significant variations among the different castes. The level of inbreeding among Muslims and Christians was similar and fairly high. Significant rural-urban differentials persist in all religions. There is no appreciable change in the level of inbreeding over the past few decades in any religion, although minor declines are observed in certain castes in the urban areas.

The institution of marriage and the prohibition of marital alliances among persons of certain kinship categories are both conditioned by religion (Lorimer, 1954). However, cultural practices may at times transcend religious barriers and marriage regulations may be relaxed as in the case of consanguineous marriages in South India (Sastri, 1976). Several authors have described the high degree of inbreeding prevailing in South India and have examined broadly its relationship to specific demographic and socioeconomic variables (Sanghvi, 1966; Centerwall et al., 1969; Reid, 1973; Roychoudhury, 1976,1980).
Studies in and around the town of Vellore in North Arcot District, Tamil Nadu, have shown that the proportion of consanguineous marriages constituted nearly 47per cent of the total mar-

riages in the rural areas and 29 per cent in the urban (Rao and Inbaraj, 1977). Although the per cent of consanguineous marriages was the highest for Hindus, it was nevertheless high in Muslims and Christians as well.
Further, in more than 80 per cent of the consanguineous marriages, regardless of religion, the spouses were first cousins or more closely related. However, there were marked differences by religion in the preferences for different varieties of first-cousin marriages. The intensity of inbreeding, especially in the case of sex-linked genes, would therefore vary by religion. In most of the current literature, inbreeding levels are computed for autosomal genes and data based on sex-linked genes are rather rare. In the present paper, the variations in inbreeding levels based on both auto-

The rural-urban differences as well as the difference between autosomal and sex-linked coefficients, however, were statistically significant (P < 0.001).
The inbreeding coefficients according to religion aregiven inTable 4.
In every religion, the inbreeding coefficients for the sex-linked genes were higher than those for the autosomal genes, butthedifference attained statistical significance (P < 0.05) only among the Hindus and Muslims. Inboth the rural and urban areas, the Hindus hada higher inbreeding coefficient (P < 0.001) for autosomal as well as for sexlinked genes.

The differences between the two birth cohorts fail to attain statistical significance.
The inbreeding coefficients by caste grouping among Hindus are shown in Table 5.
The coefficients for sex-linked genes were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than those for the autosomal genes among all the three caste groups inthe rural as well as in the urban areas.The autosomal and sex-linked coefficients were highest for the backward castes in both rural and urban areas; they were lowest for the forward castes inthe rural and for scheduled castes in theurban areas. The differences between the highest and lowest values arestatistically significant (P< 0.001).

The differences in the inbreeding coefficients between the birth cohorts of women in the rural and urban areas were not statistically significant.
The inbreeding coefficients among the major forward castes are presented in Table 6.

The coefficients vary significantly (P < 0.01) among the different castes within each place of residence. The ranking differs between rural and urban areas, with the Chettiars showing the lowest coefficient in the rural and the Brahmins in the urban areas. Reddiars had the highest coefficient in the rural areas and Pillais in the urban. Nevertheless, for any caste, the urban values were

The inbreeding coefficients among the selected backward castes are shown in Table 7.
As inthe case of forward castes, there are significant variations among the backward castes (P < 0.05). In the rural area, the inbreeding coefficient for autosomal genes washighest for the Barbers (0.0547) and lower for the Dhobis (0.0369); the sex-linked inbreeding coefficient was highest for the Barbers (0.0580) and lowest for the Acharis (0.0381). In the urban area, the coef-

ficient for autosomal genes was highest for Dhobis (0.0395) and lowest for Naickers (0.0236); whereas the coefficient for sex-linked genes was highest for the Potters (0.0485) and lowest for the Naickers (0.0253). The urban inbreeding coefficients were generally less than those intherural areas, such differences attaining statistical significance (P < 0.05) for both autosomal and sexlinked genes for Barbers, Gounders, Naickers, and Naidus and for autosomal genes only for Acharis.
The inbreeding coefficients in the two main scheduled castes, Cobblers and Harijans, are as given in Table 8.

Very close consanguineous matings, such as parent-offspring and brothersister marriages, are considered incest and forbidden in all societies.

Muslims and Christians in Bombay practice all four types of first-cousin marriages, while these two religious communities did not permit the two types of parallel cousin marriages in Andhra Pradesh (Sanghvi, 1966; Basu, 1975). The local customs of Andhra Pradesh had deeper roots than could be

modified by religious influence that came at a later stage. The fact that inbreeding is practically nonexistent in Hindus of northern India, whereas it has the highest incidence of all religions in the south, speaks of the dominance of local culture over religion. Likewise, a significantly high level of inbreeding is reported in a small group of Bhatias and a few other North Indian Hindu communities at present settled in North India, owing perhaps to prolonged cultural contact with the predominant Muslim population of the area they had inhabited (now in Pakistan) prior to their displacement (Bhalla and Bhatia, 1974). In the 1961 census survey on the incidence of inbreeding in India, the inbreeding levels of Christian tribals in Northeastern parts were shown to be lower than those of their counterparts elsewhere, mainly due to their higher social and educational status (Roychoudhury, 1976).
As among Muslims and Christians, wide variations are observed between the various castes among Hindus in both the extent of inbreeding and in the types of matings preferred. This seems more in line with the caste-cluster concept of Karve (1961) rather than with the classical interpretation of the Indian caste system where each Hindu by birth belongs to one of the four Varnas (color)-- Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras; each Varnathen is broken into several castes and subcastes, each caste normally being present in one linguistic area. The classical model thus assumes a continuous process of fragmentation, whereas Karve's model suggests that the subcastes are not invariably derivable from caste, but are patterned through migration. A group moving from one place to another perhaps entrenches itself in the caste structure by assuming a

caste name to indicate its status, at the same time retaining its group character through endogamy (Malhotra, 1976). The caste system was an experiment on a grand scale that attempted to breed varieties of men genetically specialized in the performance of different functions. To all appearances, such a specialization has not been achieved (Dobzhansky, 1967).
The inbreeding coefficient, F, as defined by Sewall Wright (1922), is the correlation between uniting gametes. In dealing with the contributions to inbreeding by a particular form of consanguineous mating, Wright's F will also denote the probability that a pair of alleles are autozygous or identical by descent (Malecot, 1948; Reid, 1973). Most studies on consanguinity have reported inbreeding coefficients for autosomal genes only. In view of the hemizygosity of males for X-linked genes, the probabilities of transmission of an X-linked trait would depend on the type of consanguineous mating involved and differ from that of autosomal genes. Where inbreeding coefficients for sex-linked genes are reported, they are shown to be invariably higher than that for autosomal (Sanghvi, 1966; Veerraju, 1973). This is not surprising because of the higher incidence of matrilateral crosscousin marriages as compared to other varieties of first-cousin marriages as shown in the present study. However, the range of differences varied from one religion to another, and among the various castes.
Genetic effects of inbreeding can be traced to the fact that the inbreeding individual may carry a double dose of a gene that was present in a single dose in the common ancestor. A recessive gene carried in a single dose in a common ancestor may remain hidden until it comes

to light for the first time in an inbreeding descendent. Intuitively we expect, therefore, that a recessive trait will occur with increased frequency in the progeny of consanguineous mates. Thus, consanguinity is important in the study of recessive inheritance and of recessive traits. With a high level of inbreeding still prevailing in South India, and with large populations of any religious group resorting to specific preferences of blood relatives, it should be interesting to study the biological effects of such inbreeding. Studies being carried out in Tamil Nadu seem to suggest considerable decline in the frequency of deleterious genes due to long-term practices of inbreeding (Rao and Inbaraj, 1979). Additional studies are urgently needed in other parts of India to shed

more light on this and to contribute fresh knowledge on selection-mutation theories in relation to human disease and health.
