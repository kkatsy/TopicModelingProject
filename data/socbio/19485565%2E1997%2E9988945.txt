ABSTRACT: This study describes patterns of sex differentials in perinatal mortality in China and Finland. The analysis is based on three population-based one-year birth cohorts, one from Qingdao, China, in 1992 and two from Northern Finland in 1966 and 1985-86, comprised of 9,219, 11,422 and 9,207 singletons with at least 28 gestational weeks and 1000 g in birthweight, respectively. Both Finnish cohorts had an excess of male over female perinatal deaths, but in the Chinese cohort girls were more likely to die than boys. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of perinatal mortality for boys was 1.31 (95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 0.98,1.78) and 1.57 (95 per cent CI 0.89, 2.78) in the Finnish 1966 and 1985-86 cohorts, respectively, and 0.82 (95 per cent CI 0.55,1.20) in the Chinese cohort. The corresponding figure for stillbirths in the Chinese was 0.57 (95 per cent CI 0.33, 0.98), which could explain the total excess of female deaths during the perinatal period. Our results suggest that the role of different social and cultural environments on the existing sex differentials in perinatal mortality between the countries needs further evaluation.

Higher infant and childhood mortality in boys than in girls is observed in almost all of the developed countries (United Nations, 1993), whereas in some of the developing countries, e.g., Jordan and Syria, girls suffer higher risk of death (Rutstein, 1984). However, there is little data available to compare sex differences in perinatal mortality, i.e., stillbirth and neonatal mortality analyzed separately, of the developed and developing societies. Finland is a developed country with high-quality maternal and child health care and low perinatal and infant mortality, while China is the largest developing country in the world. The current study aims to compare the patterns of sex differentials in perinatal mortality in Finland and China.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
COHORTS
The study was conducted on three population-based birth cohorts, two from

Northern Finland for 1966 and for 1985-86, and one from Qingdao, China, for 1992. The two birth cohorts in Northern Finland consist of 12,231 and 9,479 births, respectively, comprising 96 per cent and 99 per cent of all births in the provinces of Oulu and Lapland with an expected birth date falling between January 1 and December 31 in the former, and between July 1, 1985 and June 30, 1986 in the latter (Rantakallio, 1969; Rantakallio and Oja, 1990). In the Chinese cohort the data are from the birth records of the Qingdao Health Center for Women and Children, which routinely collects records from all 18 hospitals with delivery rooms distributed over the urban area (Xu, 1995). There were 9,391 births altogether in the data set, which account for about 98 per cent of all births in the city in 1992.
The data on deaths in the Finnish cohort were obtained by linking the files of Statistics Finland (Rantakallio, 1986).

The basic data on deaths in the Chinese cohort came from the Qingdao Health Center. Furthermore, investigators in China visited all the hospitals and local family planning organizations in the affiliated area to ensure high quality of the data on deaths (Xu, 1995). This procedure enabled those deaths that belonged to the cohort but had failed to be registered by the hospitals or had occurred at home to be retrieved.
Cases of missing information on gestational age and birthweight were excluded. For the purpose of comparison between the countries, the present work was limited to singletons with at least 28 weeks completed gestation and a birthweight of at least 1000 g in all three cohorts (Lawson and Mayberry, 1994). The numbers of births included in this analysis were thus 11,422 and 9,207 in the two Finnish cohorts and 9,219 in the Chinese cohort.
METHODS
The following definitions were employed, following WHO recommendations (WHO, 1975): (1) A stillbirth is a fetal death after 28 completed weeks of gestation. Stillbirth rate is the number of stillbirths per 1,000 live and still births. (2) An early neonatal mortality rate is the number of deaths during the first 7 days of life per 1,000 live births. (3) A perinatal mortality rate is the number of stillbirths and deaths in the first week of life per 1,000 live and still births.
Since the distribution of birthweights varies between populations, birthweights were standardized by adjusting them to a relative scale based on the underlying Gaussian distributions of weight for each population-specific group (Wilcox, 1993; Rooth, 1980). With this adjustment, birth-

weight within each group is expressed as a z score, i.e., the unit of standard deviation from the mean. As the birthweight distributions vary between boys and girls as well, the same method was extended to the sexes in this analysis, resulting in sexpopulation-specific groups. Such an approach allows the comparison of mortality among such groups with the same relative rather than absolute birthweight. Low birthweight was defined as 2 standard deviations (2 SD) below the mean for each sex-population group, as suggested by Rooth (Rooth, 1980). The gestational age used in the analysis was calculated as the interval between the first day of the last menstrual period and the day of delivery.
Information on maternal occupation and education were available for 5,280 singletons in the Chinese cohort, i.e., for mothers living in three of the five districts, Taidong, Cifang, and Cangkou. The maternal occupations were grouped, according to the Chinese classification custom, in terms of the cadre stratum, including various grades of managers in government organizations and state-owned businesses, doctors, lawyers, teachers, and most other occupations requiring a higher level of education and special professionals, and the worker stratum, including servants, workers, the self-employed, a few farmers, the unemployed and all others without cadre status. Maternal education was originally recorded on a scale of illiterate, elementary school, secondary school, and college (including postgraduate), which was transformed into the terms of the current Chinese educational system, implying a duration of schooling of ^ 6, 7-12 and s 13 years. In the Finnish cohort, maternal occupation was categorized into three groups: professionals, skilled persons (including farmers), and unskilled

workers. Maternal education was recorded the same way as the Chinese.
The crude OR in perinatal mortality for boys in each cohort (taking girls as the reference group) was calculated and adjusted for birthweight, gestational age, and maternal age by logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents the distributions of the newborns by maternal age, gestational age, sex, birthweight, and perinatal mortality. Teenage mothers were rare in the Chinese cohort, and only about 10 per cent of the mothers were over thirty, almost 90 per cent being in their twenties. In the Finnish cohorts, the proportions of mothers under 19 years were 7.2 per cent and 4.3 per cent in the 1966 cohort and 1985-86 cohort, respectively, and that of mothers over 30 was three times higher than the Chinese figure in both Finnish cohorts. The sex ratio of boys to girls at birth was as high as 111.5 in the Chinese cohort, compared with two consistent results of 105.5 in the Finnish cohorts (Table 1). The sex-specific proportions of prêterai births (<37 weeks) and low birthweight (<--2 SD) were greatest in the 1966 Finnish cohort and lowest in the Chinese cohort. Overall perinatal mortality and both boy- and girl-specific mortality were almost three times higher in the Finnish 1966 cohort than in the Finnish 1985-86 cohort, while mortality rates in the Chinese cohort were between these two (see Tables 2, 3, and 4).
OR and corresponding 95 per cent confidence intervals (CI) for boys in perinatal mortality and its components, i.e., early neonatal mortality and stillbirths, by logistic regression analyses adjusted for

gestational age (as a continuous variable and its quadratic), birthweight (<--2 SD and s--2 SD), and maternal age (as a continuous variable), are shown for the three cohorts in Table 5. The OR's for early neonatal mortality are over one in the Chinese cohort, and those for stillbirths are clearly less than one. In both Finnish cohorts boys showed a higher risk of death than girls in each component of mortality. No significant interaction terms between sex and gestational age, birthweight, or maternal age were found in any of the multiple logistic models.
Differences in perinatal mortality between boys and girls by mothers' occupation are presented for the subset of 5,280 singletons in the Chinese cohort (Table 6). Lower perinatal mortality was found in the cadre stratum than in the worker stratum among both boys and girls. As only four perinatal deaths were observed in the cadre stratum, no reliable conclusions could be drawn on the disparity in sex differentials in perinatal mortality between the two social strata. Maternal education failed to provide any further information for comparison purposes due to the small number in the group of ^ 12 years. Boys of skilled workers had a significantly higher risk of death than girls in both Finnish cohorts, but the association disappeared after controlling for maternal smoking. Maternal education had no association with sex differentials in perinatal mortality.
DISCUSSION
China has achieved a substantial reduction in infant mortality during recent decades as compared with other developing countries (Chalmers, 1980; Grant, 1992). The decline in infant mortality in China, however, has been uneven between

in companies' health clinics. This easy access to ultrasound determinations of sex makes it possible for couples who have a strong desire for a boy rather than a girl to make their choice by determining the sex of the fetus before birth, although this is not allowed by the health authorities. According to the IDFS, the illiterate, the less educated, and the farmers and workers show stronger preferences for boys than others. Our results indicate that the worker stratum not only

had a higher perinatal mortality for both boys and girls than did the cadre stratum but also had a greater excess risk of death for girls, even though the result is not statistically significant because of the small number of deaths reported in the cadre stratum. The new law on maternal and infant health in China that has been effective since June 1, 1995, strictly prohibits prenatal identification of the sex of the fetus except when "necessary on medical grounds," and it is expected that this re-

striction will prevent most sex-selective abortions and will probably normalize the sex ratio in stillbirths.
In both Finnish cohorts it is the boys who suffer higher mortality than the girls. A higher sex ratio in perinatal mortality has been consistently observed in Nordic and other developed countries (Bolander, 1984). Girls can be expected to experience lower mortality than boys by virtue of their natural biological superiority (Lopze, 1984; Wingard, 1984). One factor contributing to the especially disadvanta-

geous position of the boy fetus is that the lungs may mature more slowly during intrauterine development due to the effects of testosterone (Nielsen et al., 1982).
The occurrence of low birthweights and preterm births is observed less in the Chinese population as compared with other developing countries (Miller et al., 1993). Many studies, in fact, claim even lower rates of low birthweight among Chinese populations than among Western populations, based on observations both in mainland China (Chen et al., 1980; Beischer and

"SEX is defined as 0 if girls and I if boys;AGE (maternal age, as a covariale);LBW (low birthweight) is defined as 0 if &-2SD and 1 <2-SD; GW-SQ (quadratic term of gestational age, as a covariate); GW (gestational age, as a covariate).

Liang, 1984) and elsewhere, such as Singapore (Hughes, 1985), Hong Kong (Fung et al., 1989), the United States (Wang et al., 1994) and Canada (Wen et al., 1995). It is beyond the scope of the current study to explore possible explanations for the observed phenomenon.
In conclusion, the patterns of sex differentials in perinatal mortality between China and Finland run in opposite directions. Chinese girls experience an excess risk of perinatal death as compared with

boys, especially for stillbirths. In both Finnish cohorts boys are more likely to die than girls. Our results encourage further evaluation of the role of social and economic environments on the existing sex differentials in perinatal mortality between the two countries.

^Tie mothers' occupations were recorded according to the Chinese classification in terms of"cadre" strata (including various grades of

managers in government organizations and state-owned businesses,doctors, lawyers, teachers, and most other occupations requiring a higher

level of education and special professions) and "worker" strata (including servants, workers, the self-employed, a few fanners, the unemployed

and all others without cadre status).
