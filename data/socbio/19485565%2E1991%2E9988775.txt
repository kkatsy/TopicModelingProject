ABSTRACT: Analyses of vital data derived from a family record register for the native population of Guam reveal significant variations in births, deaths, and marriages over the period 1901-41. Although lacking marked photoperiod or temperature changes of temperate zones, the tropical island is subject to marked seasonal differences in rainfall characteristic of western Pacific islands. Marital patterns exhibit troughs associated respectively with the Lenten period and with Christmas celebrations. Infant and childhood deaths show close correspondence with rainfall patterns, consistently exceeding expected values during the rainy season (July-November) when conditions are optimal for the spread of communicable and gastrointestinal diseases. Births attain a peak in November, or at the beginning of the more advantageous season for infant health and survival. Seasonally in vital events, reported for many Euroamerican and some African and Asian populations of modern and historical periods, has rarely been documented for native populations of the tropical Pacific. Comparisons of differences in these patterns among different populations in varied environments provide unique opportunities to evaluate causal models of interactions among biological, socioculturel, and physioenvironmental factors.

T. S. Eliot notwithstanding, April was not the crudest month for the native population of the western Pacific island of Guam in the years before World War II. Rather, it typically marked the ending of the more arid part of the fanomnagan, or dry season, from January or February through June, a time when trade winds kept temperatures at or slightly below the mean annual figure of about 80 degrees, and presaged the coming period of somewhat more oppressive heat, rising in the 80's, before the monsoons brought the relative relief of the fanuchanan season, its rains augmented from time to time by the deluges of sometimes destructive typhoons, with temperatures falling into the 70's. Situated at about 13 degrees North latitude, Guam has circum-annual changes in photoperiod length that are barely no-

ticeable, and the climate remains warm and humid throughout the year.
The Hispanicized native population, whose administration was assumed by the United States Navy in 1898, depended almost entirely before World War II on a subsistence economy based on a wide range of native and introduced plants and crops collected from uncultivated areas or grown and harvested throughout the year in house gardens and more distant ranchos. A succession of seasonal reef fish ensured an available supply of protein all year long which occasionally could be supplemented by domestic pigs or chickens. Thus, native subsistence activities in this unusually beneficent tropical setting lacked any strong rhythm of alternating periods of intensive labor and relative leisure, and, except in the aftermath of

an occasional devastating typhoon, the native Chamorro did not experience marked cycles of great want or munificent plenty.
Under these circumstances, observed seasonality in vital rates and secular changes in these patterns would seem unlikely to be related to any one of such factors identified in other studies: cyclic episodes of malnutrition or excessive workload (Nurge, 1970; Mosher, 1979; Bantje, 1988; Leslie and Fry, 1989); ritual restrictions on sexual behavior during planting times (Scaglion, 1976); a climatic "comfort" factor (Chang et al., 1963; Parkes, 1976); the availability of indoor heating (Momiyama, 1977); marked socioeconomic differences (Pasamanick et al., 1960; Zelnick, 1969; James, 1971;Chaudhury, 1972; Warren and Tyler, 1979; Mitchell et a l , 1985; Steckel, 1985; Kastenbaum, 1987); migratory patterns (Menken, 1979; HussAshmore, 1988); ethnic differences (Miura, 1987), religious-ceremonial practices (Holland, 1989); or contraceptive practices (Rogers and Udry, 1988). Rather, a complex of interacting biological, physical, and sociocultural factors contributed to the probably universal phenomenon of seasonality in vital rates which now also is identified for this unique island population in recent historic times.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
As described more fully elsewhere (Underwood, 1990), a linked family register for the native population of Guam has been developed from nineteenthcentury Spanish materials and the vital registration records established by the U.S. Navy administration in late 1901. The latter recording system was interrupted upon the Japanese capture of the

island in December 1941, so that this study is based primarily on information for the years 1902 through 1940 and in large part on data of survivorship and reproductive performance for 4,176 couples formally wed during this period. Categories of vital events (weddings, first-births, :th order births, marriedadult deaths, infant and childhood deaths) by month of event were summarized, adjusted for variation in length of months, and in sequence corresponding to rainfall seasonality, beginning with February. Similarly arranged preliminary graphic representations of these data, which showed other than a single sinusoidal peak, precluded the use of tests assuming sinusoidal tendency, harmonic, or one-pulse models. Accordingly, following Nonaka and Miura (1987), I have relied on chi-square tests with eleven degrees of freedom, despite recognized limitations, and on graphic presentations to identify and test for significant seasonal differences in vital events.
RESULTS
A summary of the results of analyses (calculated seasonality indices, chisquare values, and significance levels) of vital event data for Guam, adjusted for length of month, for the period from 1902 through 1940, along with mean rainfall in inches for the period 1956-72, is shown in Table 1. Despite the high value of the seasonality index for rainfall, monthly variation in precipitation is only weakly statistically significant (p = 0.05). Highest levels of statistical significance (p = <0.001) are found for: (1) monthly variations in first marriages, i.e., marriages involving previously unwed spouses; (2) childhood and infant deaths and married-adult deaths, from

which data for 1918 are excluded due to excessive mortality resulting from the influenza pandemic in NovemberDecember of that year; and (3) for rth order births of first and of all marriages. This latter category refers to the last child, second or higher birth order, born to couples formally wed during the study period. The statistical significance of variation in birth month offirstbornchildren to all married couples (p = <0.01) exceeds that for firstborns of previously unwed spouses (p = <0.05), while no statistical significance was found for variation in birth month of children born to unwed mothers.
Normalized ratios were then calculated to provide comparisons with the results of other studies and to facilitate visual recognition of patterns from graphic representations. A simple comparison of monthly ratios for rainfall and marriage (Fig. 1) reveals the latter to have two troughs (December, March) during relative dry periods, but with peaks also occurring during months of

relatively low rainfall (January, May). A second comparison, between rainfall and birth month of firstborn children of firstmarriages (Fig. 2) also failed to suggest close association between this climatic variable and birth seasonality. However, as shown in Figure 3, infant and childhood deaths peaked during the rainy season, while deaths among married adults were relatively more frequent at the end of that period and for several months beyond, especially in January.
Since other studies in noncontracepting groups (reviewed in Parkes, 1976, and in Kevan, 1979, for example) have sought an association between month of marriage and conception (inferred by subtracting nine months from date of birth), directly or with some lag time, a graphic representation of these factors was prepared (Fig. 4), revealing one trough in inferred conceptions in the same month when marriages were most frequent, but a peak one month after a secondary peak frequency in marriages.

Finally, Figure 5, showing general similarities in seasonality of calculated month of conceptions between first order and ith order births, questions initially any strong influence of marital month and month of first successful conception, while the contrasting trend in nonmarital conceptions--almost a mirror image of marital conceptions-- belies the operation of a general common environmental factor affecting conceptions/births.
DISCUSSION
Although seemingly unrelated to climatic seasonality, for which rainfall serves as primary index, marital seasonality is closely associated with the Catholic Church religious cycle and associated obligations. Peak marriage periods, in January and May, surround

the Lenten period and "Promesa" obligations (Table 2) and the major trough in March weddings. A secondary trough in December coincides with the penitential season of Advent and the celebratory obligations of Christmas. If this interpretation is correct, secular decreases in amplitude of marital seasonal patterns of peaks and troughs, as can be seen in Figure 6, would predictably follow increased wage employment (Mayo, 1988, pp. 56-57) and growth of membership in Protestant churches (Carano and Sanchez, 1961, pp. 399401).
Behavioral factors played a critical role in the statistically weak association observed between date of first marriage and inferred month of conception of first child. As reported elsewhere (Underwood, 1990), nearly one-third of all first births to married couples during this pe-

riod occurred within less than nine months from date of marriage and almost 25 per cent of all births were to unwed mothers. Expectably, despite decreased amplitude of variations in seasonal marriage patterns in the latter part of this study period, the magnitude of monthly variations in inferred conceptions actually increased slightly. Expectably, too, in the presumed absence

of direct influence of marital date on higher order births, no statistically significant secular difference was found in seasonality of ¿th birth order offspring to married couples.

ployment, helping to defray the costs of weddings and new households, and to increasing membership in other religious groups. Today, marital seasonality for the multi-ethnic population of modern Guam parallels that of the mainland United States, with peaks occurring in June and December (Government of Guam, 1985).
Comparison of seasonal patterns of births to married couples with births to single mothers quickly dispels anyreasonable possibility of a significant climatic influence on monthly distributions of births, while high levels of premarital sexual activity obscure the relationship between marital and natal seasonality. When attention is directed only to those first births occurring more than eight months after marriage, over 50 per cent of inferred successful conceptions are estimated to have taken place within the first few months of marriage. The broader distribution of the timing offirst births to the remaining part of fertile married couples represents expectable heterogeneity in fecundability, including some degree of earlier spontaneous abortion. Elsewhere (Underwood, n.d.) I will argue that the anomalouslow percentage of "full-term" births within one year of marriage to women wed in April represents an example of seasonal epidemic spontaneous abortion.
Despite its seeming universality, seasonality in vital events does not proceed

from identical causes in those human populations studied to date. It is, moreover, now evident that neither cultural nor biometerological causes suffice, separately, to explain the universality ofthe phenomenon nor the complexity underlying its variable manifestations in different populations. Indeed, the effective environment of each human population is a product of interactions between these forces and, to date, comparisons most commonly have been drawn among populations whose effective environments, even in similar bioclimatic regimes or the same geographic locale, may be wholly distinct.
April was, indeed, not the cruelest month in historical Guam, but a time to look forward to increased numbers of marriage fiestas and a relative dearth of funeral occasions. It was the same month when infant and childhood deaths and stillbirths reached their annual nadir. It was, in many climatic and demographic respects, the best of times.
