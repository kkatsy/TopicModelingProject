ABSTRACT: The opportunity for intensity of selection is studied in two backward caste groups with different occupations, namely Yadava (pastoral) and Vadabalija (fishing) of Bheemunipatnam Taluk of Visakhapatnam District, Andhra Pradesh. The amount of selection intensity is found to be higher in Vadabalija (0.8583) than Yadava (0.5827). The contribution of mortality to the total index of selection is greater in Vadabalija (0.6095) than in Yadava (0.3326). When consanguineity is considered, the fertility components of selection intensity (0.1885) are lower in the consanguineous group of Yadava than in the nonconsanguineous group (0.2845), whereas in Vadabalija they are higher in the consanguineous group (0.5261) than in the nonconsanguineous group (0.2223).

Selection, one of the micro-evolutionary forces is responsible for gene frequency variation in a population which in turn could be deciphered through differential fertility and mortality. This was first devised by Crow (1958) using census data on birth distribution. Changes in differential fertility and mortality components due to socioeconomic and cultural factors have an effect on natural selection (Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971). Studies on the Indian tribal and caste populations (Murty and Ramesh, 1978; Barua, 1976; Rao and Murty, 1984; Rajanikumari et al., 1985; and others) have supported this observation. The inbreeding also influences the intensity of natural selection as its effect is found to be greater on mortality than fertility (Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1971). The present paper reports on selection intensities in relation to inbreeding among two endogamous caste groups--the Yadava and the Vadabalija.

The Yadava is a pastoral community while the Vadabalija is a fishing community. Both are socially backward.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reproductive histories and family pedigrees were obtained from the Yadava and the Vadabalija of Bheemunipatnam Taluk of Visakhapatnam District, Andhra Pradesh, India, during 1986-87. Necessary information was collected from 310 Yadava and 273 Vadabalija women through interviewschedule method. For the estimation of Selection Intensity (I), only the reproductive histories of 114 Yadava and 135 Vadabalija women, who had completed their fertility are considered. The method of Crow (1958) is adopted in the calculation of Index.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
From Table 1, it is evident that the mortality component (Im) is higher in

Vadabalija (0.6095) than in Yadava (0.3326), while the fertility component (/y) is almost equal in both groups. However, the differences of these components between consanguineous and nonconsanguineous in each group is not uniform, though the frequency of consanguineity (Rajeswari, 1988) is lower among the Yadava (33.46 per cent) than the Vadabalija (35.71 per cent). It can be noted that (Table 1) higher selection intensity is associated with higher mean live births and higher mortality component (71.1 per cent) and the corresponding low fertility differential (28.99 per cent) may be due to inadequate sample size and higher prereproductive mortality. In the Yadava, the fertility component of selection intensity (0.1888) is lower in consanguineous than in non-consanguineous (0.2845) which is in contrast to the Vadabalija.
Table 2 compares the estimates of selection intensities available for some Indian caste populations. The total selection indices are generally high in tribes and low socioeconomic groups by higher inbreeding levels compared to urban and high socioeconomic

groups with low inbreeding levels (Rao and Murty, 1984). The index value (I) ranges from 0.23 to 3.69 in 64 populations from all over the world (Sphuler, 1973), whereas in Indian caste populations, it ranges from 0.24 to 2.11. A value greater than 1is mostly restricted to tribal and a few caste populations (Pattusalis and Malas). Studies on rural populations (Mala, Madiga and Malia) exhibit middle order values and Vaddes and Malas exhibit the lowest value.
In the present study, it is observed that selection is due to mortality component rather than fertility component. Hence, there is more scope for selection to act through differential mortality than fertility. The higher mortality among these populations may be due not only to their socioeconomic, cultural, and other environmental factors but also to some genetic factors.
