ABSTRACT: Using data from the 1973, 1976, and 1982 National Survey of Family Growth Studies, mothers' retrospective reports of their children's birthweights are compared across surveys and with vital registration data. Comparisons focus on estimated levels for blacks and whites, and on the effects of possible detenninants. Despite the fact that nonresponse is more common for blacks, especially for births occurring at dates more distant from the surveys, results show that retrospective reports of low birthweight (< 5.5 pounds) provide valid and reliable estimates of trends and differentials.

Data of demographic interest are routinely collected retrospectively, including birth and pregnancy histories. Sometimes information about each (or a selected) birth is gathered. For example, the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) asks questions about the sex, birthweight, breastfeeding, length of gestation, and survival of each child. These data are an important supplement to vital registration data because they provide a much greater range of information than is available from birth certificates. Such information, like smoking behavior or whether the birth was planned, might help account for birthweight variability or its consequences.
This note addresses the accuracy of retrospective reports of children's birthweight. Such an examination is especially timely. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (1986) identifies low birthweight as the major

contributing factor to infant mortality in the United States. Of special concern is the large and parallel disparity in birthweight and infant mortality between blacks and whites. Much research into these disparities will use retrospective reports like those examined here; and the NSFG, specifically, will be a major data source used for such work.
To test the reliability of birthweight reports, we take advantage of repeated cross-sectional surveys--the 1973,1976, and 1982 NSFG. Since the data are retrospective reports, the relevant information for some birth cohorts is available from more than one survey. For each cohort, we examine whether the different surveys provide similar estimates and differentials.
We will also assess validity by comparing trends from the NSFG with vital registration data. Since the vital registration data come from birth certificates this data will be accurate.

Figure 1 low birthweight estimates (weighted to produce national estimates) for whites and blacks. Also shown as a solid trend line are vital statistics estimates. Comparisons between the NSFG data and vital statistics can be made for the full 1963-81 period. However, prior to 1969, vital statistics included blacks in the "All Other" category. This inconsistency in definition is reflected by a break in the trend line.
The NSFG estimates vary sharply from year to year. Because of the smaller sample size of black births, estimates for blacks are more variable than for whites. Note that three-year averages of these estimates would pull them into closer correspondence with the vital statistics data.
The biggest differences between the NSFG estimates and those made from vital statistics data are found in the years 1965, 1970, 1972, and 1974 for blacks. Although visual inspection of the NSFG data might suggest that the incidence of low birthweight is declining for blacks, regression analysis, weighted for outliers, reveals no significant change across year (results not shown here). In addition, none of the individual points lie more than two standard deviations from the vital statistics trend line which shows no evidence of decline.
COMPARISON OF LOW BIRTHWEIGHT
ESTIMATES ACROSS SURVEYS
Using unweighted data for cohorts represented in more than one survey, we show in Table 2 the distribution of births by low birthweight (<5.5 or 5.5 pounds or greater) and the date of the survey. From the first panel, for whites and blacks respectively, the 1973 NSFG estimated odds of low birthweight are 0.84 and 0.99 as great as the 1976 odds. The chi-squares associated with these

odds ratios (3.6 and 0.01, with 1 degree of freedom) indicate that these odds ratios are not significantly different from 1.0 (at the 0.05 significance level). These results demonstrate a close correspondence across surveys; observed differences in low birthweight could result easily from sampling variability. Statistics in Panel 2 and 3 can be similarly interpreted. Only for whites born between 1972-75 are estimates significantly different (at the 0.05 level). The 1976 NSFG estimate is over 40 per cent higher than the 1982 one. This difference can be seen in Figure 1but does not appear as a major discrepancy. Again, some statistically significant differences were found, but they were few in number and formed no interpretable pattern (results not presented here). These differences in levels, although rare, are more frequent than would be expected given simple random sampling and no difference between surveys.
BIRTHWEIGHT DIFFERENTIALS ACROSS
SURVEYS
The above analyses tested whether overall levels are similar across surveys. In most cases, they were. But even if they are not, differentials could be estimated reliably. Suppose a shift in question wording or procedure produced an increase in the reported incidence of low birthweight. As long as this artifactual effect is pervasive, then it would not affect differences between groups. Such an assumption is commonly made. For instance, vital registration data show that divorces are under-reported in retrospective marriage histories like those collected in the Current Population Survey (CPS). However, divorce differentials seem to be reliably estimated from CPS data (see Thornton and Rodgers, 1978).

We use logistic regression to estimate the effects of mother's education and mother's age at child's birth on the likelihood that a birth is less than 5.5 pounds. As expected, estimated effects indicate that births to teen mothers and to those with less education were at greater risk of being low birthweight (results not shown). Replicating results from the previous section, the only significant (level) effect of study was in the comparison of the 1976 and 1982 surveys (cohorts 1972-75) where the 1976 survey shows significantly higher levels. Thus, this difference remains after basic controls are introduced.
Our primary interest lies in possible interactive effects with another covariate. Since the birth cohort experience we have selected from the various surveys is identical, no interactions are expected. If we find none, then we cannot reject the hypothesis that the effects of covariates are equal in the two (or three) surveys.
Results (not shown) indicate slightly more significant interactions than would be expected by chance; but they are scattered, not systematic, suggesting sampling variability as the most likely explanation.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
Results presented and described here are generally encouraging. Levels and trends obtained from retrospective reports generally match vital registration data. Given that vital registration data is highly accurate, this result indicates valid measurement of birthweight from retrospective reports. Second, similar levels and trends are obtained from retrospective reports obtained several years apart. Further, levels and differentials estimated in one survey closely correspond with overlapping experience in other surveys. Thus, retrospective reports also appear reliable. There are scattered significant differences that should caution researchers against overinterpreting unexpected effects that have not been (or cannot be) replicated with a second survey.
Our generally encouraging results are consistent with those reported by Swicegood et al. (1984) with respect to the reliability of reports concerning the timing of the first birth. Studies of retrospective reports of "early" initiation of sexual activity (Kahn et al., 1988) and reports of marital disruption (Preston and McDonald, 1979; Thornton and
