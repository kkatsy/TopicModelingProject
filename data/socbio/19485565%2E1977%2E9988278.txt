may differ when examining female employment and fertility across generations, as that of mother and daughter.
The specific purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between mothers' employment and daughters' ideal family size preferences in order to ascertain the usefulness of family background factors and to determine whether family size ideals are formed early in life.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The sample was drawn from a sample of the adult American population conducted in 1975 by the National Opinion Research Center. In the present study, the sample was narrowed to married women in the childbearing years aged 18 to 49 resulting in 434 cases.
The employment-of-mother item was dichotomized into a yes-no response. The question read "Did your mother work for as long as a year around the time you were 16?"
RESULTS
Employment of respondents' mothers showed a very interesting finding. Those respondents whose mothers worked for a year or more reported a mean ideal family size of 2.54 children. Those who reported their mothers not working had a mean ideal family size of 2.25 children. The modal categories were 4 or more children for daughters whose mothers worked, and 0-1

children for daughters whose mothers did not work.
Daughters of mothers who worked could have perceived their mothers as either postponing or deciding not to have additional children. It is likely that mothers favored employment over childbearing. This could have influenced respondents (daughters) to have higher ideals than daughters whose mothers did not work. It is difficult to determine exactly what factors are operating here, but respondents whose mothers worked could have negatively viewed their mothers' postponement or not having additional children in their (the daughters') formative years.
This finding indicates that female employment across generations may not depress fertility as the case may be when viewing a single cohort. Since there is a general concensus that family size ideals are formed early in the life cycle, this data at least minimally supports the notion that mothers' employment has a negative effect on daughters' fertility.
It appears that mother's employment and such family background variables as father's occupation, family income, residence, religion, and size of family of orientation could be useful in investigating family size preferences. It might be even more useful to study relationships between ideal family size, family background factors, and current family factors in order to strengthen the growing body of knowledge in fertility research as well as to examine fertility across generations.
