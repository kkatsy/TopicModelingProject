One of the more widely surveyed issues concerning the mounting population problem is the preferred or ideal size of family. The most commonly reported figure hovers around 3.2 children with remarkably minor differences associated with familial or demographic variables such as race, social class, and background family size (e.g., see Blake, 1967; Bogue, 1967; Pohlman, 1969).
One weakness common to these studies is that typically only one type of question is asked: How many children do you want? Consequently, while we have knowledge about an individual's most preferred size, we lack information about his ordering of preferences; nor are we clear about the relation between sex composition and preferred family size.
In a recent paper, for example, Russo and Stadler (1971) report traditional attitudes continue to hold regarding family size, i.e., 84% of their subjects desire from 2 to 4 children. Yet, it is the position here that parents have boys and girls; that "children" is a conceptual and mythical entity which does not exist.
A few studies have concerned themselves with the desired sexual composition of offspring. Generally, children of both sexes are wanted with the tendency to prefer

boys to girls (e.g., see Dinitz, Dynes, and Clarke, 1954; Freedman, Freedman, and Whelpton, 1960; Rainwater, 1965, p. 131; Sheps, 1963; Weiler, 1959). Suppose individuals were now asked to choose between a family of three girls or a family of three boys and two girls, i.e., three children to five children. In this comparison, would the factor of size or the factor of sexual balance prevail? It is this and similar issues which we propose to explore in this study.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
To assess the relationships stated above, the Method of Paired Comparisons was used. In this technique, every stimulus or item is presented in a pair with every other item and a judge must indicate which of each pair represents the greater degree of the attribute under consideration. From this, a matrix is generated giving the number or percentage of times each item is judged to be higher or greater for that attribute than each other item. Guilford goes so far as to suggest that the results might very well serve as the criterion of validity against which to check any of the less accurate or less dependable methods of evaluating (1954, p. 174). Myers and Roberts (1968) utilized a similar technique

with family makeup, and while laborious and more time consuming than most other assessment procedures, it should define precisely the relation among the family constellations.
Recruited as subjects were 25 teachers taking graduate courses in sex education at Montclair State College. Of these, 14 were male and 11, female; their median age was 24. Twelve were single, twelve married, and one was widowed. Thirteen attended religious services at least once a month. Within this group, 24 thought the population explosion a real and important problem; one indicated otherwise. Additionally, 11 teachers were in favor of some kind of legal restriction on the size of families; 14 were not in favor.

*The first number in the parentheses represents the overall rank order for preferred constellation ranging from most preferred (1) to least preferred (21). The second value represents the number of respondents selecting that constellation as first choice. Values with halves indicate ties.

Working with family sizes ranging from 0-5 children, there are 21 possible family constellations (Table 1). When every con-

stellation is paired with every other one, 210 pairs of constellations are generated.
Both the order of presentation of item pairs and the constellation order within each pair were randomized. Among item pairs, boys preceded girls approximately half the time. One such item appears as follows:
A. No boys--three girls. 102.
B. Four boys--one girl.
The teachers were instructed to examine each pair of family constellations and select the one they preferred. A separate answer sheet was provided.
Following the questionnaire, a personal data sheet containing questions about age, sex, religiosity, etc., was answered. The scales were answered anonymously and voluntarily.
RESULTS
If every teacher had always preferred a particular family constellation to every other one, that constellation would have received a perfect mean frequency of 25. The strongest finding for preferred family constellation is that sexual balance is critical (Table 1). The seven most preferred ones contain at least one boy and one girl (M, H, D, I, L, and R ) . The seven least preferred constellations consist of only boys or only girls (K, B, O, C, P, A, and
U). When we average out the different con-
stellations of the same size, the most preferred family size is three children (F = 26.33; d.f. = 5,399; p< 0.001). For no children, X = 5 . O 5 ; for one child, X = 8.95; two children, X = 15.05; three children, X = 15.65; four children, X = 13.69; five children, X = 10.78. Hence, we might describe the relation between size and preference as being curvilinear. That is, none or one child families tend not to be

synonymous variables and may obtain different numbers of children. Hence, there exists good reason to drop the number of children question altogether. As noted by Myers and Roberts (1968):
When a woman responds to a conventional question on ideal family size, we can speculate on what composition she may be using as a context for her response. From these data, it is clear that the sex combinations are extremely critical, (p. 169)
Most intriguing are the data yielding individual differences and exceptions. Overall, M is the most preferred constellation and U, the least preferred. Nevertheless, at least one teacher prefers no boys and five girls (U) to two boys and two girls (M). Similarly, at least three teachers would rather have five boys and no girls (P) to two boys and two girls (M). Interestingly, at least one teacher would rather have five girls and no boys to four girls and no boys. If one assumes that response or clerical error does no account for these exceptions, then a deviant case analysis can probably reveal good insights into the dynamics of family planning.
As noted, the sample consisted of only 25 teachers so that one hesitates in making inferences to other populations. Nevertheless, the data do not vary that strongly from those reported by Myers and Roberts (1968) who worked with Puerto Rican mothers. The procedure is lengthy and working with a six-child family could

make extensive assessment impossible. The
data, however, do point to possible avenues
of research.
