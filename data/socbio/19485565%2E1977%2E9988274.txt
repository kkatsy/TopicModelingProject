ABSTRACT: Responses from 6,642 adolescents from forty-six high schools in the United States were analyzed in a stepwise multiple regression to determine the independent as well as the combined effects of the variables (family size, birth order, and objective social class of father) on high-school grade point average. Family size and birth order were not important. Contrary to other research findings, social class was of some importance. However, additional variables need to be introduced to explain grade point average.

Grade point averages are presented for family size and birth order separately and jointly. The effects of social class are also considered in this section. As Table 1 indicates, there is a variation from 2.65

The matrix presented in Table 3 visually indicates the relationship of family

dieted by the Zajonc model except in the second, third, and fourth rows where there is a GPA decrease in each case of increasing birth order when family size is held constant. As social class is held constant in Table 4, even that relationship disappears. This finding argues for the importance of the social class variable. In Table 4, there are 25 discrepancies from Zajonc's predictive model between the pairs in each panel. With this type of pattern, one would have to argue that the Zajonc model is not supported insofar as grade point average in concerned.
Inasmuch as these tables have only described the relationships, we used a stepwise multiple regression to determine the independent as well as the combined ef-

can be assumed to be zero at any level of significance no matter how large. However, the hypothesis that it is zero for social class can be rejected at virtually any level of significance. A second indication of the weak predictive power of birth order and family size is their small contribution to the multiple correlation coefficient. Birth order adds 0.003 per cent and family size adds 0.002 per cent to the explained variance. Finally, even though the partial slope for social class is clearly nonzero, it only accounts for 5.638 per cent of the variance in grade point, indicating that additional variables ought to be introduced.

DISCUSSION
Our data do not reveal family size and birth order as relevant predictors of academic grade achievement. The Dutch data, however, indicate they are very much related. Reexamination of the matrix in Zajone's article indicates 11 discrepancies. From the tables presented by Belmont and Marolla, in which three class groups are utilized, 22, 13, and 27 pair discrepancies respectively out of a possible 72 pairs in each table are identifiable. Perhaps the findings of the above authors are not supported by their data to the extent claimed.
In addition, the differences, while gen-
