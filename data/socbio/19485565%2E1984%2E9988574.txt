ABSTRACT:A comprehensive benefit-cost analysis of the screening program to detect newborns with congenital hypothyroidism in Wisconsin is presented. Congenital hypothyroidism, if left undetected and untreated at an early age, can have serious irreversible effects on the growth and development of the brain. The monetary costs of the detection and treatment program for congenital hypothyroidism were compared with the projected benefits (avoided costs) that result from the prevention of the mental retardation associated with the disorder. Future costs and benefits were determined using a 4 per cent, 7 per cent, and 10 per cent rate of discount. Net benefits (benefits minus costs) for detecting and treating one individual with congenital hypothyroidism were approximately $98,200 ($141,700 - $43,500) using the 7 per cent rate of discount. Net benefits for detecting the 13 individuals with congenital hypothyroidism in 19811982 totaled $1,277,000.

Neonatal thyroid screening programs are designed to prevent congenital hypothyroidism and prevent, through treatment, the mental retardation and other serious complications associated with this disorder. Public acceptance of screening programs is partly based on the perception that the costs of the program will be offset by the benefits derived from successfully preventing the serious consequences of a particular disorder. In general, infant screening programs directed toward the prevention or early detection and treatment of selected genetic and metabolic disorders have been demonstrated to be good economic investments in preventive health care (Barden et al., 1984; Bush et al., 1973; Conley and Milunsky, 1975; Dussault et al., 1980&, Laberge, 1980; Layde et al., 1979; Scriver et al., 1977). As concern over rapidly escalating costs of health care increases, cost-benefit analysis is increasingly accepted as one useful way to estimate the potential eco-

nomic value of established or projected health programs. The following report provides a comprehensive analysis of the economic costs and benefits of the program for detecting infants with congential hypothyroidism in Wisconsin.
Congenital hypothyroidism, if left untreated, can have a devastating effect on growth and development in general and on development of the brain and central nervous system in particular. If treatment is delayed until clinical signs of the disorder appear, irreversible damage to the brain is likely. Unfortunately, during the first 8-12 weeks of life, only 5 to 15 per cent of infants with congenital hypothyroidism can be identified using clinical signs alone (Dussault et al., 1980a; Fisher et al., 1979; Mitchell and Larsen, 1980). Because of this difficulty in early diagnosis, newborn screening of every infant is a vital necessity.
Screening programs designed to detect congenital hypothyroidism have

been in existence since 1972. Millions of infants have been screened in developed countries throughout the world (DeLange et al., 1979; Dussault et al., 1980a, 19806; Fisher et al., 1979; Hulse et al., 1980; Miyai et al., 1978; Walfish et al., 1980). Approximately one in every 4,000-6,500 infants is born with congenital hypothyroidism. As more countries initiate screening programs and report results, considerable population variability may become apparent. Brown et al. (1981) reported that the incidence of congenital hypothyroidism was nearly six times more frequent in white than in black individuals in Georgia.
Congenital hypothyroidism can result from a variety of abnormalities of the thyroid system, including abnormalities of embryogenesis, inborn errors of thyroid function, and endemic hypothyroidism (Fisher, 1980). Because of the multiple etiologies of congenital hypothyroidism, in some cases there have been difficulties in determining the specific cause of the thyroid system dysfunction and in establishing an appropriate treatment protocol.
Most cases of congenital hypothyroidism are caused by abnormalities of embryogenesis that result in agenesis, hypoplasia, or ectopia of the thyroid gland. These disorders result in primary congenital hypothyroidism. Secondary hypothyroidism is caused by disorders of the pituitary. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency and panhypopituitarism are two examples. Tertiary hypothyroidism is the result of abnormalities associated with the hypothalamus (Price et al., 1981). The incidence of primary hypothyroidism (1:4,000) is much greater than the incidence of secondary and tertiary hypothyroidism combined (1:68,000). Goitrous hypothyroidism, caused by defects

in thyroid hormonogenesis, occurs with an incidence of 1:30,000 (Dussault et al., 19806; Fisher, 1980).
Congenital hypothyroidism is one of the most common preventable causes of mental retardation (Fisher et al., 1979). Early treatment of hypothyroid infants is generally effective in preventing the mental retardation associated with this disorder (Dussault et al., 1978; Klein et al., 1972; Raiti and Newns, 1971; Vanderschueren-Lodeweyckx et al., 1980). However, one study has indicated that neonatal screening and early treatment may not be able to prevent the mental retardation that may occur in the 3-4 per cent of infants with congenital hypothyroidism who show clinical signs of the disorder at birth (New England Congenital Hypothyroidism Collaborative, 1981). For these infants the duration and severity of fetal hypothyroidism is believed to be most important in determining the outcome of mental development (Glorieux et al., 1983; Morreale de Escobar and Escobar del Rey, 1980).
The protection that early treatment of congenital hypothyroidism extends to the development of the brain as manifested by normal IQ scores appears to be somewhat less complete in regard to the development of later, more subtle manifestations of neuropsychological dysfunction. Neuropsychological dysfunctions associated with untreated congenital hypothyroidism include hyperactivity and short attention span, impaired spatial orientation, difficulties in fine motor coordination, and difficulties in learning mathematics (New England Congenital Hypothyroid Collaborative, 1981). Infants detected through the Quebec Network for Genetic Medicine Screening Program and treated at an early age demonstrated evidence of

minimal disorders in the areas of hearing-speech performance and practical reasoning at the ages of 18 and 36 months (Glorieux et al., 1983). However, because of uncertainty concerning the reliability of predicting future mental development from tests on children below 4 years of age, no definitive statement concerning the long-term effects of congenital hypothyroidism on neuropsychological development was made. Several other investigators have indicated that impaired brain function was evident in many hypothyroid subjects, including some who were treated during the first month of life (MacFaul, 1978; Wolter et al., 1980).The conclusion that may be drawn from these studies is that early detection and treatment of infants with clinically unrecognizable congenital hypothyroidism does result in normal or near normal intelligence, but some less serious neuropsychological manifestations of the disorder may still occur.
The Wisconsin Infant Health Screening Program for congenital hypothyroidism follows a two-tiered system of testing in which T4 (thyroxin) is the primary marker and TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) is tested on those individuals with a low T4 value. A similar procedure is utilized by the New England Regional Hypothyroid Screening program (Mitchell and Larson, 1980). The flow diagram for the Wisconsin testing program appears in Figure 1. Briefly, the blood specimen is collected by hospital staff on standardized filter paper and sent to the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene for analysis. T4 is tested by a commercially available radioimmunoassay test (ImmunospotTM T4, Meloy Lab, Virginia). TSH testing utilizes the Neonatal TSH Kit (Diagnostics Product Corporation, Los Angeles, California). If the initial test for T4 is in the

lower 10 per cent of the T4 assays for a particular day, further analysis is done. If the T4 result is in the lower 10per cent of samples and greater than 8.0 ug/dl, and a subsequent TSH assay is less than 20 ulU/ml, the sample is normal. If the TSH result is greater than 20 ulU/ml, the sample is abnormal and the child is considered to have hypothyroidism. If the initial T4 assay is in the lower 10 per cent of assays and is less than 8.0 ug/dl, a repeat T4 assay and a TSH assay are completed. If the second T4 result is greater than 8.0 ug/dl and the TSH result is less than 20.0 ulU/ml, the sample is normal. However, if the TSH result is greater than 20.0 ulU/ml the sample is considered abnormal. If the T4 result is less than 8.0 ug/dl on either the initial or repeat test, but the TSH result is less than 20.0 ulU/ml, the sample is reported to be possibly abnormal. Once an abnormal sample is found, the child's physician is contacted by phone and is sent a written report indicating this finding. The physician is then responsible for following through with subsequent tests to verify the results.
COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS
Cost-benefit analysis is one method of estimating the potential economic costs and benefits of a particular program. In the case of screening for congenital hypothyroidism, the program costs represent the value of resources used to detect and treat individuals with the disorder. Program costs are compared with the avoided costs (benefits) that result from the early detection, treatment, and prevention of the many developmental abnormalities associated with the disorder if undetected and/or untreated. These benefits include avoided costs of institutionalization and other residential care and services af-

forded to the mentally retarded, added costs of special education, foregone maternal income, and lost productivity of individuals who suffer disability or premature death because of the disorder. In the present analysis, a net benefit value

was derived by subtracting the costs of detection and treatment of individuals with congenital hypothyroidism from the benefits (net benefits = benefits costs).
Program costs are presented as the

cost per sample and the cost to detect one individual with congenital hypothyroidism. Benefits are presented as the total avoided costs that result from the detection and successful treatment of each individual with congenital hypothyroidism. All values are expressed in 1982 dollars. If 1982 values were not available, the most recent figures were inflated to 1982 levels by using the gross national product deflator for each intervening year (StatisticalAbstracts of the UnitedStates, 1981).
Because not all costs and benefits occur simultaneously, cost-benefit analyses must achieve comparability between present costs and costs that take place in future years by discounting the value of future costs and benefits to present values. Discounting is necessary because a given amount of money available today is worth more than that same amount at some time in the future. The difference between the present value and the value of that cost or benefit in the future represents the lost opportunity value of the money involved. Assuming a 7 per cent interest rate, we find that a $1,000 benefit that occurs in one year's time is worth only $935 in terms of present value; a $935 investment today would be worth $1,000 in one year's time. The discounted present value (7 per cent discount rate) of a $1,000 benefit that takes place in 10 year's time is worth only $508. The present value of %Yaccruing in n years at a discount rate of 7 per cent is calculated as $17(1.07)" (Hartunian et al., 1981). Because of discounting future costs and benefits to present value, costs that take place in the distant future are relatively less significant in terms of present value than costs and benefits that occur in the present or near future (see Eastaugh, 1981, for a discussion of discount rates).

The appropriate discount rate to use in cost-benefit analysis is a matter of some concern. A high discount rate will cause programs with high present costs and with benefits that occur in the future to be less attractive economically than programs with similar costs and benefits occurring in the present or near future. Low discount rates give more weight to costs that must be borne by individuals of future generations. Some investigators feel that the discount rate should reflect the average rate of growth of the gross national product, i.e., 3-4 per cent in recent years (Andreano and McCollum, 1983; Gramlich, 1981). Others believe that the discount rate should reflect the rate of inflation or rate of interest that could be obtained from a high quality bond or other private sector investment, i.e., 7-10 per cent. In some costbenefit analyses several discount rates are used and the choice of which is appropriate for a particular situation is left to the policymakers who evaluate a particular program. In the present study, discount rates of 4, 7, and 10 per cent were calculated. Although tables and narrative use the 7 per cent discount rate, values associated with the other discount rates are given in the footnotes of the relevant tables.
An important issue concerning costs and benefits of prevention programs is that of reproductive "compensation" or "replacement." In the case of disorders that are prevented by termination of pregnancy, the projected lifetime costs of an individual with a disorder such as Down syndrome can be viewed to be affected by whether or not the affected fetus is "replaced" by an infant with normal genotype (Hook, 1979). Andreano and McCollum (1983) concluded that the replacement case was not a relevant consideration when determining the net

benefits of an amniocentesis program. However, in calculations concerning congenital hypothyroidism, the abnormal child is essentially "replaced" by a normal one as a result of early detection and successful treatment with thyroid hormone. The question of whether the child with congenital hypothyroidism will be completely normal in a neuropsy-
chological sense is not entirely clear. Because the major abnormalities associated with congenital hypothyroidism, including mental retardation, are generally avoided by early detection and treatment, the present study will assume normality. Therefore, in calculating benefits (avoided costs) of hypothyroid screening, the consumption costs ($4,000) of a normal individual were subtracted from the costs of care of the untreated individual with congenital hypothyroidism. In addition, the difference between the wage earnings of an average normal individual and the expected earnings of an individual with untreated hypothyroidism (or with treatment delated until the appearance of gross clinical signs) constitutes lost productivity and is included as a benefit when the "replacement" situation applies (Hook, 1979).

visits, blood tests, and the minimal cost (approximately $20.00/year) for thyroid hormone replacement medication.
The cost of collecting the blood specimen in the hospital was estimated to be $4.60. This cost included expenses for drawing blood, administration costs, medical record costs, supplies, billing costs, and overhead. Because one collection procedure provided the blood specimens for four screening tests, the cost of the hypothyroid portion was $1.15 ($4.60/4).
All samples collected in relation to the Wisconsin Infant Health Screening Program are sent to the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene for analysis. The State Laboratory tests blood samples for congenital hypothyroidism, phenylketonuria (PKU), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) and galactosemia. The laboratory costs for each of these four test procedures were allocated according to the commitment of personnel (FTE) and the cost of supplies associated with each test. The laboratory cost of testing for hypothyroidism was estimated to be $3.45 per sample (Table 1). This cost included personnel salaries, supplies and expenses, administrative costs, and general laboratory overhead.

PROGRAM COSTS
The costs of the program to prevent the serious developmental abnormalities associated with congenital hypothyroidism include the cost of screening and detection and the subsequent costs associated with the treatment of those detected. Screening and detection costs included the costs related to the collection of the blood specimen and the costs incurred for laboratory testing. Treatment costs for individuals with congenital hypothyroidism were modest and included the costs associated with periodic clinic

When the initial tests for congenital hypothyroidism are determined to be positive, recall tests must bedone toverify the initial finding. The recall rate in Wisconsin was estimated to be approximately 2percent. Thegreat majority of recalls were ultimately determined to be due to false positive results of the initial tests. The cost of recall was estimated to add $1.60 to the cost of each sample tested (Table 10).
The sum of the costs for collecting and testing, including recall tests, was the cost for processing each sample. This cost wasestimated to be $6.20 for the period July 1,1981 through June 30, 1982. Thecost for processing each sample was then multiplied bytheincidence of congenital hypothyroidism inWisconsin (1:6,500) to arrive at the cost for detecting each case. The discounted cost of detecting each case of congenitalhypothyroidism was $40,300 (Table10).

BENEFITS
The benefits that result from the detection and successful treatment of an individual with congenital hypothyroidism are represented by the total cost of the disease if left untreated. In thecase of congenital hypothyroidism, earlydetection before clinical manifestations of the disorder appear is essential to prevent themental retardation that iscommonly associated with this disorder. The benefits (avoided costs) generallycomprise three elements: (1) expenditures related tothelifelong care of anindividual with congenital hypothyroidism whose disorder was not treated until ob-

vious clinical manifestations of the disorder appeared; (2) loss of productivity resulting from premature death or disability; (3) the pain, suffering, emotional deprivation, and changes in the quality of life for the affected individual and those associated with him/her (Sorkin, 1975). Although this latter cost constitutes an important and potentially large proportion of the total benefits (avoided costs), it is difficult to express in monetary terms and is generally not included in cost-benefit analyses. However, the social value of avoiding the cost of pain and suffering associated with a particular disorder should not be forgotten when evaluating any prevention program and should be as important as estimated monetary costs and benefits when evaluating a particular program (Mamunes, 1976).
Benefits (avoided costs) which can more easily be expressed in monetary terms include: cost of institutional care, cost of foster care, cost of special education, cost of adult care and services, cost attributable to the lost productivity of an affected individual, and costs associated with a mother who foregoes an income to care for an affected child.
The avoided costs of institutional and residential care and services for an individual with congenital hypothyroidism represent a large component of the benefits associated with the hypothyroid detection program. In order to estimate these costs over the lifetime of the individual, one must take into account the increased mortality that might be associated with a particular disorder. Because most cases of congenital hypothyroidism would eventually be identified and treated, any excess mortality was that associated with institutional living for those whose mental retardation resulted in their being institutionalized. The

present report used the 95 per cent of normal survival rate suggested previously (Layde et al., 1979).
The anticipated level of mental retardation of an individual with congenital hypothyroidism who is not detected and treated at an early age is an important consideration when estimating avoided costs based on the proportion of affected individuals who would require institutional care, foster care, adult care and services, and special education. The amount of lost productivity also varies according to the projected level of mental retardation. For the present analysis it was assumed that 15 per cent of individuals with undetected congenital hypothyroidism would be severely mentally retarded (IQ 35 and below), 25 per cent would be moderately retarded (IQ 50-36), 20 per cent would be mildly retarded (IQ 69-51), and 20 per cent would have suboptimum intelligence IQ 85-70). Twenty per cent would have normal intelligence.
In 1982 the cost of institutional care at the Wisconsin Centers for Developmental Disabilities was approximately $36,500/year. From this figure, $4,000 was deducted to reflect the personal consumption costs which would have been incurred by the family if the child were normal and not institutionalized (Sorkin, 1975). Consumption costs were estimated from figures presented for a family of four and included the estimated costs for food, housing, clothing, medical care, and other necessities (Statistical Abstracts of the United States, 1981). In the present analysis it was assumed that institutional care would not begin until age 5. The estimated longterm cost of institutional care for one individual with congenital hypothyroidism, assuming institutionalization from age 5 to 70, was approximately

$325,000 (Table 4). However, because only 15 per cent of children with this disorder would be severely retarded and require long-term institutional care, the average cost of long-term institutional care per child with congenital hypothyroidism was estimated to be approximately $49,000 (Table 9).
The annual cost of foster care was estimated to be $5,000 ($9,000 less $4,000 personal consumption costs). The discounted cost of foster care was estimated to be approximately $32,000 for the years from age 5 to 20 (Table 5). For congenital hypothyroidism, the average cost per child for foster care, assuming that 25 per cent of affected children would require foster care from age 5 to 20, was $8,110 (Table 9).
Annual costs of adult residential care and services was estimated to be $12,000. This figure is admittedly a rough estimate. The average cost for adult nursing home care in Wisconsin ranged from $30-$85 per day, with com-

munity services providing many of the services not provided by the nursing homes in the lower cost range. The cost of residential services provided by group

"Lifetime productivity figures were derived from Conlcy. (1973) andbrought to 19K2levels byapplying theannual percent changes in wage rates for the period 1971-81 (Statistical Abstracts of the United States, 19X1). Conley'sfigureswere based on the following assumptions:
(a) Earnings of mildly retarded were comparable to theearnings of the general population to age 25. Thereafter, earnings decline to86% of normal for males and 87% of normal for females;
(b) Earnings of moderately retarded workers were 20% ofnormal, (c) Employment rates for mildly retarded workers were the same asforthe general population up tothe age of25. Thereafter they were 4% below average for males and 12% below average for females;
(d) Employment rates among moderately retarded workers were 45% of normal for males and 12% of normal rates for females;
(e) Mortality rates were 25% above normal for mildly retarded subjects and75% above normal for moderately retarded subjects;
(f) The value of unpaid work was 25% of gross earnings for men and 37.5% of gross earnings for women. The unpaid productivity forwomen mainly represented homemaking services.

If the recall tests were done at the State Lab. the cost per test was $7.(X).The cost for the test, clinic visit, and travel would be $37.(X). Approximately 20% of recall tests are tested at the State Lab. The average cost for recall tests was thus approximately $80.00.
