International Soundex Reunion Registry Seeks Volunteer Geneticists

The International Soundex Reunion Registry (ISRR) seeks geneticists concerned for the welfare of adoptees at risk for unknown specific inherited disorders. They should be willing to contribute their knowledge by serving on a volunteer basis with the Genetic Evaluation Guidance Committee.
The International Soundex Reunion Registry is a nonprofit supportive system concerned with the needs of people whose lives are touched by adoption. An ISRR registrant may be any adult, 18 years of age or older, who desires a reunion with next-of-kin by birth. Trustees of ISRR are representative of each sector of the adoptive triangle and are adoption professionals. The services of ISRR are voluntary, unpaid, and free to the user.
ISRR is concerned with the problem of the child whose "genetic blueprint" is torn through relinquishment to adoption or foster or institutional care. Under existing sealed records statutes, ISRR believes that the child is denied knowledge of personal genetics and an adequate concept of individual heredity that should be part of the intellectual and physical insurance of every human being. Inherited disorders not apparent at birth remain unknown until tragedy

strikes and the struggle for survival begins.
Within the United States, there are approximately 5 million adult adoptees. Their issue often span three generations. Within the next five to twelve years, an estimated 2 million adoptees now minors will reach the childbearing age.
The ISRR receives an average of 4,000 registrations annually. Of these, one out of every twenty adult adoptees is handicapped to some degree with inherited disorders. One out of every fifteen married adult adoptees indicate inherited disorders for their children and grandchildren. One out of every twelve birth parents registers inherited disorders. One out of every seven adoptive parents of minor children registers because their child suffers a degenerative inherited disorder or has died as a result of an inherited disorder.
Geneticists and other professionals interested in volunteering their services to ISSR should contact George R. Anthony, ISRR National Office, P.O. Box 2313, Carson City, Nevada 89702, Telephone (702) 882-0329, or Dr. Joseph H. Davis, c/o PACER, 860Bryant St., Palo Alto, California 94301.
