Sex Ratios at Birth in a Micronesian Atoll Population

ABSTRACT: The recent suggestion that typically masculinized sex ratios at birth in Micronesian populations may be related to a distinct "Micronesian pattern" of life-course coital behavior is applied to data on the sex ratio of livebirths on Butaritari Atoll in Kiribati. The data show that sex ratios on Butaritari are highly masculinized and do not vary significantly with changes in maternal age. However, there is a discernible relationship between the length of closed intervals preceding male and female births. The lack of age-related change in sex ratios in the Butaritari sample is inconsistent with ethnographic data regarding levels of marital coital activity in relation to increasing age and marriage duration. The Butaritari sex ratio data is argued to support the suggestion of a "Micronesian pattern," although it is posed that further tests of this association are required.

In this same journal issue (pp. 200206), Jane Underwood proposes that indications of a typically masculinized sex ratio at birth in Micronesian populations may be related to a distinctive "Micronesian pattern" of marital coital activity (also Underwood 1990; 1993Ö). This suggestion is based in part on her own historical demographic reconstructions of secondary sex ratios (SSR) of the Chamorro population of Guam and comparison with other published sex ratio data from the region. For the Guam case Underwood (1993a) argues:
I suggest that the increasing level of SSR with parity and parental age among Guamanian married couples most likely reflects a distinctive behavioral pattern in which coital frequencies remained high throughout married women's reproductive years--an interpretation consistent with retrospective ethnographic data.

She also comments:
Only further studies in relatively more traditional Micronesian societies can confirm the suggested Micronesian pattern of continuing high levels of sexual activity regardless of age or marital duration responsible for elevated SSR so far reported for populations in this part of the Pacific (p. 206).
To test further Underwood's proposition, this paper reports on sex ratios at birth for the Micronesian atoll population of Butaritari in the Republic of Kiribati. The examination of this particular Micronesian case has two key advantages. First, this population is, as Underwood suggests, "relatively more traditional." Second, a detailed description of marital sexual activity exists for this group (Brewis, 1992a; 19926), and demographic data can be combined with ethnographic data in drawing conclusions about the

relationship between sex ratios and coital activity patterns.
THE IMPUTED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
SEX RATIOS AT BIRTH AND COITAL
ACTIVITY
Variations in the number of males to females born, termed the secondary sex ratio (SSR) or sex ratio at birth, have been suggested to occur within and between human populations in association with a multitude of factors. These include "race" (James, 1985a; Teitlebaum, 1972), birth order, and sexual composition of previous births (Chahnazarian, 1988; James, 1987, pp. 728-729), parental exposure to such infectious diseases as measles and hepatitis B (Drew et al., 1986; Langaney and Pison, 1979), and maternal smoking behavior (James, 1987, p. 734).J Further, secondary sex ratios do not reflect only sex ratios at conception (the primary sex ratio or PSR), but also sex-differential mortality during gestation. The points in a pregnancy at which various factors influence sex ratios have proved difficult to isolate with any precision. Sex selective differences in prenatal mortality could hypothetically produce a SSR quite different to the PSR (e.g., Chahnazarian, 1988). Data on karyotypic sex in spontaneous abortion suggest that PSR and SSR may be quite comparable (Stinson, 1985). However, such studies are plagued by the problems of identifying and sampling pregnancy losses in the early post-conception period--the phase in which embryonic death is par-

ticularly closely tied to chromosomal abnormality (Chahnazarian, 1988, pp. 217-218).
Despite the problems of controlling for the variety of factors which may affect human SSR and isolating the connection between PSR and SSR, it appears possible a relationship between intercourse frequency and sex of offspring may exist. This idea has been explored and developed with greatest force in the work of James (e.g., 1971; 1976; 1983; 1986; 1987). It appears that conceptions occurring earlier or later in the fertile portion of the maternal cycle are more likely to be male, following a U-shaped distribution (Guerrero, 1974; James, 1983). Thus, this model poses that couples having more frequent intercourse would be more likely to produce a conception early in the ovulatory phase, and therefore to display a higher (more masculinized) sex ratio at birth.
The proximate mechanisms that may account for this relationship between timing of intercourse (and, by association, its frequency) and production of male offspring are not clear, given the difficulties of experimental testing of hypotheses and a resultant reliance on retrospective data (Levin, 1987). Possibilities include cyclic variations in vaginal or cervical ph affecting X versus Y chromosome motility or survival (Guerrero, 1975; Roberts, 1978), differential survival of male or female conceptions resulting from conceptions involving over-ripe ova and spermatozoa (Harlap, 1979), coitusinduced ovulation (Bartos, 1980), and cyclic variations in parental hormone levels around ovulation (James, 1989; 1990).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
THE SAMPLE
The Butaritari data on sex of births described herein is based on reproductive history interviews for 201 women resident in Butaritari village in 1990.2 These interviews produced data on 636 livebirths, of which 631 are of known, confirmed sex. Birth registrations for the island were also collated, providing information on the sex of 5,470 livebirths for the years 1898-1988.3 As birth registrations are absent or incomplete for some years, here the sample derived in reproductive histories is judged likely to be more accurate. Specific effort was made in interviews to probe for births which may have been otherwise unreported, such as those dying in the first few hours or days after birth.
There is no evidence of any sexselective memory bias in mothers, as cross-checked with other sources, such as vital registrations and village clinic records. This finding is in keeping with a lack of cultural bias to a specific preference for either sons or daughters-- both of which are highly valued in Butaritari society, albeit for different reasons (Brewis, 1992a). There is also no reason to suspect that birth registrations reflect sex-linked underreporting of either male or female neonates.
2All interviews were conducted in the vernacular by the author. See Brewis (1992a) for a protocol description.
3HoweIl (1990) estimates 1,000 or more births are required to make reliable inferences about secondary sex ratios. However, Sieff (1990) counters that the use of reproductive history data overcomes many of the sampling problems of noninterview data sets (such as vital registrations), the latter needing larger sample sizes to raise accuracy to an "acceptable" level.

And, despite the caveat about the quality of vital registration records, the sex ratio reported for births reported in reproductive histories of 111.0 is not markedly different from the ratio of 114.1 calculated from the vital registrations.4 Although "expected values" for human groups fall in the range of 104-107 (Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971), these figures are within the range of SSR calculated for other Polynesian and Micronesian groups, as shown in Table 1. This result indicates the figures are in no way extraordinary in the Micronesia-Polynesia region, even though they are pronouncedly masculinized.
RESULTS
The Butaritari reproductive history data on sex of offspring were broken down by parental age, order of birth, and length of the interval between births. SSR variation by maternal and paternal age at the time of the birth is presented in Table 2. Only cases in which parental age could be ascertained with some certainty (N = 631 and N = 521, respectively) are included. SSR of offspring born to women aged under 30 years is 107.8, lower than that of 117.7 for offspring born to mothers at age 30 and above. Although a possible trend to increasing masculinity with age of mother may exist, there is no statistical difference in offspring sex between those born to women under thirty or those age thirty or above (x2 = 0.243, df = 1, p = 0.622). A possible reverse trend
4Secondary sex ratios are calculated as Nmale/ Nfemale * 100. A ratio greater than 100 indicates an excess of male births.

may exist in relation to paternal age, as the SSR of offspring of men under 30 years of age is lower than the SSR of those born to older fathers (112.0 and 104.8, respectively). This association also proves to have no statistical significance, however (x2 = 0.200, df = l,p = 0.655).
SSR variation by birth order for all livebirths of known sex .(N = 631) is presented in Table 3. Although conventional wisdom states that SSR tend to decline with increasing parity (i.e., with advancing birth orders) (e.g., Sieff, 1990), this pattern is not seen in the Butaritari sample. Sex ratios are highest among the middle-order births rather than the lower-order ones. Although this finding could possibly reflecta bias introduced by the small subsample sizes, the description of a very similar birth order association in the

Guam data (Underwood, 1993, p. 204) makes it quite possible that the figures represent a real phenomenon.
When the preceding birth interval is considered, a more discernible pattern emerges. For marital births following intervals in which spousal separation or partner change did not occur and no overt pregnancy limitation was attempted (N = 517), the SSR displays a trend of increasing femininity as preceding birth interval duration increases, as shown in Table 4. There is a significant difference between the mean interval preceding male births of 28.04 months (SD = 19.43, N = 270), and the mean of 31.48 months (SD = 20.11, N = 247) preceding female births (f = 1.974, df = 515, p = 0.049). A statistically significant difference is also seen in the sex of offspring born following intervals of

CONCLUSION
If we assume, following James' proposition, that couples having more frequent acts of coitus have increased probabilities of producing sons, the masculinized SSR from Butaritari reflects fairly high coital rates. Specifically, as SSR does not decline with maternal age and may even display a trend toward increase, on the basis of SSR data it is possible to infer that coital activity is being maintained with advancing maternal age and, in association, with increasing marriage duration.
If this finding is augmented with the argument that couples engaging in more frequent unprotected acts of coitus would be expected to conceive sooner and therefore to have shorter birth intervals, then lower sex ratios would be expected to be associated with longer birth intervals. The Butaritari case demonstrates just this--a significant difference in sex of offspring associated with time from the last birth, with female births predominat-

ing after longer birth intervals and vice versa.
Such an argument solely based on SSR inferences has many possible flaws,including the possibly confounding influence of hepatitis B infection (Drew et al., 1986), this infection being prevalent in Kiribati (Tibbs, 1987). However, the ethnographic data from Butaritari provides strength to this putative SSR-coital-activity relationship. As is described in detail elsewhere (Brewis, 1992a), marital coital frequency is maintained at fairly high levels in Butaritari society despite advancing female age and increasing marriage duration. A comparable situation is described for the Chamorros of Guam by Underwood (1993a; 1993&), where couples are continuing regular sexual activity with advancing age. Further, demographic data on fertility performance demonstrate little reduction in livebirth production or increase in secondary infertility in susceptible women before they reach their forties and with increasing marriage duration in both the Guam (Underwood, 1990) and Butaritari (Brewis, 1993) populations. With such concordance between ethnographic and demographic data in these two Micronesiari examples, it is quite possible that regional SSR's may

As mentioned earlier, Polynesian groups also typically display highly masculinized SSR. It does appear from the limited evidence available that pronounced masculinity in SSR may be the norm for both Pacific regions.Fol-
