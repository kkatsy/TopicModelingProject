ABSTRACT: The biomedical literature for the period 1978-84 was surveyed for nine categories of alcohol response (consumption rate, absorption rate from the digestive tract, metabolism rate, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) variants, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) variants, "alcohol sensitivity," cardiovascular changes, psychological changes, alcohol abuse), looking for data on possible ethnic differences. These data were supplemented by selected earlier studies. Excepting psychological changes (on which there were very few studies), evidence for ethnic (or racial) differences was found in each category of response. The most striking differences were between Orientals and non-Orientals; about half of all Orientals lack a high-activity form of ALDH which all non-Orientals have. As a direct consequence, these "deficient" Orientals have markedly increased alcohol sensitivity (flushing, dysphoria, cardiovascular response). These enzyme differences are very probably due to a single gene, as are ethnic differences in ADH variants. For rates of absorption and metabolism, the ethnic differences probably have a polygenic basis.

The problems of alcohol use and abuse (e.g., Moser, 1980) continue to generate much interest and research. Although it has long been known that there are marked differences among individual Caucasians in alcohol use, responses, and abuse, mean differences between ethnic groups (races) were not objectively studied until about the middle of this century (see Jellinek, 1960). The first clear demonstration of racial differences in alcohol sensitivity, documenting the much greater average sensitivity of Orientals, was given by Wolff in 1972. A review of racial differences in alcohol metabolism (Reed, 1978) also suggested differences. A brief general

review by Reed (1981) confirmed the greater sensitivity of Orientals.
Study of ethnic differences in alcohol "responses" (use, physiological and psychological responses, abuse) is worthwhile in itself for increasing our general understanding. It is also worthwhile for furthering our genetic understanding of alcohol responses (AR). Differences in AR may be due to environmental differences (E) between ethnic groups, to genetic differences (G), or, most likely, to a combination of environmental and genetic differences (E + G). Formally, ethnic group differences are between-group differences and are the logical complement of the

within-group (e.g., within Caucasians) differences among individuals which have been more extensively studied. E and G may contribute to both types of differences in AR.
Recent large-scale surveys of genetic diversity within and between races (Nei and Roychoudhury, 1982) have demonstrated that (1) there is great genetic variability (e.g., about half of structural loci are polymorphic, i.e., a locus has two or more common alíeles) in all races and that (2) most of this genetic variability is withinraces, not between races. The implications for AR of this genetic diversity are important: Many AR directly or indirectly depend on specific enzymes or proteins--direct gene products--which should reflect this diversity. We therefore have strong a priori reasons for expecting some genetic contribution to many within-race differences in AR and also to a number of between-race differences. It is worth noting here that genetic differences between human groups within major races, measured as "genetic distance," are small for Caucasian groups, considerably larger for Oriental groups, and very large for North and South American Indian groups. Among the three major races, the genetic distance between African Blacks and Caucasians or Orientals is larger than between Caucasians and Orientals (Nei and Roychoudhury, 1982).
This review of ethnic differences in AR is based primarily on a literature review of papers published in the interval 1978-S4, supplemented by some earlier works. It includes the following nine areas of AR: consumption rate, absorption rate (from the digestive system), metabolism rate, alcohol dehydrogenase variants (isozymes), acetaldehyde dehydrogenase variants, alcohol

sensitivity (facial flushing and dysphoria), cardiovascular changes, psychological changes, and alcohol abuse. For each area an interpretation of the ethnic differences in terms of E and G will be attempted. In general, when E is absent, as in isozyme differences, or is small, G must necessarily explain most or all of the ethnic differences in AR. In the light of the preceding discussion, it is not surprising that the ethnic differences in physiological AR are concluded to be due mainly to G. On the other hand, some AR, such as consumption rate (as liters of 100 per cent ethanol per capita per year), seem to be largely due to E. For some AR there are few data on ethnic differences and no firm conclusions are warranted.
REVIEW OF NINE ALCOHOL RESPONSES
1. ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION RATE
(ACR)
There is considerable difficulty in making comparisons of the alcohol consumption rate (ACR) values of different groups, beginning with the fact that, at least in the United States, self-reported ACR seriously underreports the true ACR (Munch et al., 1981). Further, the reported values have meaning only in regions where alcohol is freely available, without widespread religious, moral, or economic restrictions. International comparisons are further restricted to those countries with welldeveloped national statistics. Consequently, the only international ethnic comparison available appears to be among developed countries of the Western World and Japan; the latest year for comparison was 1978 (Table 1).

trast, no significant differences in mean time to peak were found among the three racial groups in the Hawaiian study.
Interpretation.--There appear to be clear racial differences in the North American studies. This conclusion seems reasonable since a study of young adult German males found a marked genetic effect on absorption rate (Kopun and Propping, 1977). Because the Hawaiian study does not show racial differences in absorption time, possibly dueto small sample sizes, a final conclusion must await further data. Fast absorption may have "practical" consequences because, for a given test drink, it will usually produce a higher peak BAC than does slow absorption (e.g., seeTable 2).
3. METABOLISM RATE
The rate of metabolism of ethanol (to acetaldehyde) of different groups is best

measured as the rate, ß, of disappearance of alcohol from the blood following a test dose (Reed and Kalant, 1977; Wilson and Erwin, 1983). ß ^ is commonly used, i.e., mg ethanol/dl x hr. There are many studies reporting BOO estimates in Caucasians, and a number in non-Caucasian ethnic groups. Table 3 gives BOO values from a variety of studies on Caucasian males, both selected and unselected for usual alcohol consumption. There is a definite trend for ß«)to increase from a mean of about 13 in nondrinkers to a mean of about 17 or 18in heavy drinkers. There is a notable variation in ßöo among individuals (within studies). Table 4 gives the available ßeo estimates for racially defined nonCaucasians. (The estimate obtained by Fenna et al., 1971, in Western Canada is omitted here because that study differs from all others in techniques--use of intravenous infusion, for example--and

Interpretation.--There appears to be a small but real difference between Caucasians and North American Indians in mean ßgo values, with the Indians having higher alcohol metabolism rates. No other clear racial differences are apparent. In the absence of obvious environmental differences which could explain this difference in ßeo (differences in alcohol consumption have already been shown to be insufficient), genetic differences seem implied. This seems reasonable since appreciable genetic determination of ß(o, within Caucasians, has already been demonstrated (Kopun and Propping, 1977).

these two gene loci there are at least two common alíeles (genes) (Ricciardi et al., 1983). The variation at the ADH2 locus is between the "usual" (in Europeans) and "atypical" isozymes. At the ADH3 locus, the genotypes for the ADH'3 and ADHj alíeles (producing phenotypes ADH', ADH*-; and ADH*) are all common. Table 6 presents frequency data on these ADH variants (isozymes) in various populations. There is a marked difference among populations in frequency of the "atypical" ADH2, from only 2.5-11.1 per cent in Western Europeans to 84-91 per cent in Orientals.

Interpretation.--There are marked differences between Europeans and Orientals in frequencies of genes at the ADH2 locus and possible differences at the ADH3 locus. The reasons for these differences are not apparent. To date, there are no known physiological consequences in vivo of having different ADH phenotypes (Ricciardi et al., 1983).
5. ALDEHYDEDEHYDROGENASE
VARIANTS (ISOZYMES)
Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) catalyzes the second step in alcohol metabolism, from acetaldehyde to acetate. ALDH exists in at least five different isozymes whose structural bases are now being investigated (Ricciardi et al., 1983). One of these, ALDH-I (Goedde et al., 1983), has the highest activity (lowest Km) and also shows a marked polymorphism (present or absent) in Orientals and related ethnic groups. Other groups all seem to have ALDH-I. Table 7 presents the available data on ALDH-I deficiency. No persons lacking ALDH-I were found among Europeans

or Africans, but the eastern Asiatic groups have deficiency rates of 8-57 per cent. A South American Indian group seems to have a high frequency of deficiency, whereas a North American Indian group (Oklahoma) has a low deficiency rate. It is noteworthy that of the two groups of alcoholics studied, the data on English alcoholics agree with those on the normal English population in showing no deficiency, but the frequency in Japanese alcoholics (2.3 per cent) differs markedly from that in the normal Japanese population (44 per cent).
Interpretation.--The contrasts among no ALDH-I deficiency in Europeans or Africans, up to 54 per cent deficiencyrates in Oriental populations, and as much as 69 per cent deficiency in South American Indians are the greatest racial differences in alcohol response or metabolism so far reported. ALDH-I deficiency is almost certainly due to a mutant variant in the structural gene for the enzyme. Unlike the ADH polymorphisms, this ALDH polymorphism has major consequences for alcohol use and abuse, which will be discussed below.

anese would become sick before drinking enough alcohol to become dependent on alcohol. The normal Japanese, however, like most Europeans, can drink enough to become dependent if their social and/or psychological and/or physiological situation encourages such drinking. ALDH-I deficiency in Orientals also seems to explain the relatively low consumption rates in Orientals: Those lacking ALDH-I often find the consequences of drinking unpleasant and so tend to drink little, or not at all.
Together, these observations on the variation in AcH metabolism due to ALDH-I being present or absent, and the consequences for the individuals, constitute the clearest racial variation in alcohol response.
7. CARDIOVASCULARRESPONSES
Changes in cardiovascular (CV) parameters, such as heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), after consuming

alcohol have long been recognized. Beginning ten years ago, several studies have shown consistent differences between Caucasians and Orientals (usually Chinese and Japanese) in their CV responses, the latter showing greater increases in HR and greater decreases in SBP and DBP (review in Reed and Hanna, submitted for publication). As noted in the section above, most, if not all, of these racial differences can now be ascribed to the ALDH-I deficiency present in about half of all Orientals. There appear to be no published data on CV responses of other racial groups.
The published data on CV responses give group means of changes in CV parameters; individual changes are not reported. Because this almost universal reliance on group means (of changes) has generated the false impression (e.g., Naitoh, 1972; DeLuca, 1981) that there is little within-group variation in such CV responses, it may be useful to report here the responses to alcohol of individ-

uals within three racial groups. These are data on normal young adult male Americans residing on Oahu, Hawaii (Reed and Hanna, submitted for publication). There were 46 of European ancestry, 30 of Japanese ancestry, and 27 of Chinese ancestry, ranging in age from 20 and 38 years (means: 25.6 to 27.7 years). After fasting, they received 0.59 g ethanol/kg (about three drinks) and were tested for HR, SBP, and DBP before and 1,2, and 3 hours after drinking. Figure 1 gives the individual changes (from baseline) in these three CV responses, at 1 hour post-alcohol, for each of the three groups. Japanese and Chinese do not differ in mean responses; when pooled as "Orientals," they show the previously reported differences from Caucasians, and the HR and DBP differ significantly. The new result here is the great within-group variability in each response in each race and the fact that this variability in Europeans is about as large as in Orientals. Repeated measures analysis of variance (Reed and Hanna, submitted for publication) shows that this variability among individuals (within-races-- is very significant. Another important result is that there is no clear division of the Japanese or Chinese distributions into two subpopulations.
Interpretation.--The greater mean CV responses of Orientals to alcohol appear to be largely, if not entirely, due to the lack of the ALDH-I isozyme in about half of the population, as discussed in the preceding section. This polymorphism for ALDH-I predicts that there would have been two populations of Orientals in the Hawaiian study, those with and those without this isozyme, and that this might be seen in the distributions of CV changes. Figure 1 does not show this, however. Within

each ALDH-I class there apparently is still considerable variability in CV response (also shown in the Japanese data of Mizoi et al., 1983) so that there is an appreciable overlap between the two subpopulations. The marked variability in CV responses of Europeans, all of whom (almost certainly: see above) have ALDH-I, makes this interpretation plausible. The interesting question of whether Orientals with ALDH-I differ from Europeans in their CV alcohol responses has yet to be tested.
8. PSYCHOLOGICAL RESPONSES
There has been very little work done in this area; a search of the literature revealed only two relevant studies. Farris and Jones (19786) studied 15 Caucasian women and 15 Indian women in Oklahoma for alcohol's effects on memory. Both groups were equally affected. Sanders et al. (1980), in Hawaii, studied 40 males of Japanese ancestry and 20 males of European ancestry for psychological effects of alcohol. The only difference (P<0.05) was that Japanese felt less fatigued after drinking. There was no attempt to relate this finding to the ALDH-I or facial flushing status of the Japanese.
There are too few studies in this area to draw any conclusions.
9. ALCOHOL ABUSE (INCLUDING
"ALCOHOLISM")
This is another very difficult area for making comparisons between ethnic groups. The main problems are regional differences in definitions of "alcohol abuse" and lack of data, "reliable" or not, from the "less developed" countries. Only two types of comparisons could be made; these are shown in Tables 9 and 10. Table 9 presents data from representative "developed" countries

(including Japan) and from Thailand (the only "less developed" country) on the percentage of admissions to psychiatric units (hospital, clinic, etc.) among males who have a diagnosis of "alcoholism." The percentages for Western countries range from 37 in France to 9.0 in the U.S.A.; for Japan and Thailand, they are 6.6 and 4.5 respectively. Table 10 compares the relative frequencies of alcohol-related problems in U.S. Indians with those of the U.S. general population. In each of four categories, the Indians have a much higher relative rate of such problems. A similar disparity also occurs in Canada. For example, in Ontario in 1977,2.1 per cent of the population was Canadian Indian, but 26.4 per cent of liquor offenses were committed by such Indians (Irvine, 1978).

used as an indicator of alcohol abuse (Moser, 1980, p. 48) because its presence usually correlates with heavy consumption. For example, France (see Table 1) has the highest per capita ethanol consumption (16.0 liters/year) and the highest rate of cirrhosis in males (47.6/ 105) (Moser, 1980, Table 8). Many alcohol abusers do not develop cirrhosis, however, and there are unexplained

anomalies in national rates. For exam-

ple, England and Wales had a rate of 3.8/105 in males and the U.S. rate was 21.2/1O5 in males, but the annual per capita ethanol consumptions were 7.1 and 8.5, respectively (Moser, 1980). Even so, it may be meaningful to note here that the cirrhosis rates for Japan, Singapore, and Thailand were 19.7,9.3, and 7.7, respectively, per hundred thousand (Moser, 1980).

sible. Table 9 clearly suggests, however, that rates of alcohol abuse are higher in the Western developed countries than in Japan and Thailand. This agrees with the lower consumption in Japan (see Table 1) and also with the existence of a high frequency of "alcohol sensitive" ALDH-I deficient persons. In fact, ALDH-I deficiency in Japan raises the

Undoubtedly there are other national differences, but we lack the necessary data to show them.
The comparison between American Indians and the general population of the U.S.A. in rates of alcohol-related problems is considerably more convincing. The alcohol problems of U.S. Indians, as a whole, have long been recognized (May, 1982), and the data in Table 10 illustrate this. At the same time, the great variation among Amerinds in alcohol use and abuse must be noted. Some groups, such as Navajos, are relatively abstemious (May, 1982). Nevertheless, there is no doubt of an overall, relatively high level of alcohol problems among American (and Canadian) Indians.
There may be other ethnic differences in rates of alcohol abuse, e.g., involving U.S. Blacks and Hispanics, but there appear to be no recent data on other ethnic comparisons.
DISCUSSION
The overall finding of this review of the nine areas of alcohol response is that, whenever there are enough data (all areas except psychological responses), there is evidence for differences among ethnic groups. Among these racial differences, all show some evidence that genetic differences are a factor in producing the response difference. The degree of genetic involvement, however, varies widely, from 100 per cent in the case of the enzymes ADH and ALDH, to a much lower proportion (in non-Orientals) in the case of alcohol consumption rates, for example, where the environmental factors of religion, moral views, and economics are obviously of great importance. In the very important area of alcohol abuse,

the only direct evidence for genetic involvement is in the European-Oriental difference. Here the lower "alcoholism" rate in the latter, in Japanese at least, can be understood as a simple consequence of the alcohol sensitivity of individuals who lack the ALDH-I isozyme. No such clear conclusion can be drawn in the case of U.S. Indiangeneral population differences, especially since the Indians vary greatly among themselves and their frequently unfavorable social environment may often encourage alcohol abuse. It should not be surprising that clear-cut evidence of a role for heredity in alcohol abuse was not found in this survey of the literature. Such evidence, withinCaucasians, has only recently been available from large-scale adoption studies (e.g., Cloninger et al., 1981) that control for the important environmental effects of the childhood home.
Except for the enzyme differences (and their directconsequences, such as flushing) which are almost certainly due to allelic variation at an autosomal locus, the modes of inheritance of the various alcohol responses considered above are unknown. These responses are continuously distributed, quantitative traits and, by analogy with better-known quantitative genetic traits, we may reasonably expect them to be determined by a number of genetic loci, each with a relatively small effect (i.e., polygenic inheritance). Such a conclusion seems especially sure when considering physiological responses such as blood pressure or heart rate change. Blood pressure in humans is known to be under strong polygenic control (Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971), and alcohol may modulate this genetic effect. A study in mice directly showed quantitative genetic de-

termination of alcohol-induced change in heart rate (Reed, 1977).
In conclusion, it seems appropriate to note that in focusing on ethnic differences--group differences--we have (intentionally) ignored themuch greater genetic variation within (ethnic) groups. About 90 percent of the genetic variability ofour species iswithinracial groups (Neiand Roychoudhury, 1982). All of the between-group differences in this review canalso befound withinethnic groups. It is useful tostudy and un-

derstand between-group differences, in alcohol responses and other traits. It is essential, however, to place such differences, when they exist, inthewider context ofthe total variation in geneticand environmental factors that affect the traits under consideration.
