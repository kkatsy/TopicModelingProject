Mormon Fertility and the Americanization Hypothesis: Some Further Comments

A recent article in this journal by Spicer and Gustavus (1974) pointed out and discussed the continuing high fertility of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormons). This brief report will further develop and comment on some of the points of the Spicer and Gustavus paper.
In spite of the fact that the United States census does not collect data on religion, a variety of census and vital statistics data from the state of Utah can serve to document the high level of Mormon fertility in the United States relative to the national population since over 70 per cent of Utah's population could be found on the church membership rolls in 1970. As Spicer and Gustavus pointed out, the crude birth rates of Utah have traditionally been substantially higher than the overall U.S. rate as far back as accurate vital statistics data for states have been available. Utah has always had one of the highest crude birth rates of any state in the Union. Indeed, in the last ten years, Utah has often been the state with the highest crude birth rate. In 1970, Utah had the highest fertility rate (number of children born in a year per 1,000 women aged 15-44) of any state (U.S. Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare,

1974, p. 9). The 1970 census also showed that Utah had the highest number of children ever born per 1,000 married women of any state.
Spicer and Gustavus pointed to a series of statements by top church leaders of the Mormon church expressing opposition to the use of contraception as a main factor supporting and maintaining the high level of Mormon fertility. While these statements undoubtedly have influenced some Mormon couples not to use birth control, it is questionable if Mormon theological objections to contraception is the major factor behind the high level of Mormon fertility. There is substantial evidence that Mormon couples have used contraception extensively in spite of the opposition of church leaders. As Spicer and Gustavus pointed out, the fact that the crude birth rate reported by the church has followed the same general trends as the national rate in and of itself is strong evidence for the extensive use of birth control by Mormon couples. A number of studies since World War I I have indicated that there is substantial acceptance and use of contraception by Mormons (Christensen, 1947; Westoff and Potvin, 1967; Miller, 1972).
One of the reasons that church leaders'

have been able to claim some justification for their actions. A comprehensive historical review of Mormon attitudes toward birth control concluded that while church leaders have continued to oppose birth control in principle, the church has in practice increasingly tolerated the use of contraception by its members (Bush, in press).
If one wishes to explain thehigh level of Mormon fertility, one should not look so much at specific teachings by church leaders opposing contraception, as at the overall emphasis placed on therole of marriageand the family in Mormon culture. Mormons believe that marriages performed in one of their temples will endure after death. I t is considered a religious duty to marry and "raise an eternal family." It is taught that

* There are almost no blacks in the Mormon Church. Therefore, a comparison between Utah whites and whites in the general U.S. population is the most meaningful comparison in terms of differences between Mormons and nonMormons. In 1960, however, the census did not break down Utah fertility data for whites and non-whites. Nonetheless, since nonwhites comprise less than 1 per cent of Utah's population, the 1960 comparison between U.S. whites and the total Utah population is for all practical purposes a comparison between whites.

This trend can beseen as resulting from a number of distinctive features of Mormon culture. First ofall, Mormons tend to marry young. In 1970, the median ageat which married persons in Utah had been married was 22.8years formales and 20.2 years for females. The comparable figures for the total U.S. population were 23.4years for males and 20.7 years for females. The

this tendency did exist among young Mormon couples. However, the fact that the overall level of Mormon fertility has remained high, particularly among women in the later part of their reproductive years, would seem to be an indication that when Mormon couples do have children, they are still likely to have more children than the national average.
