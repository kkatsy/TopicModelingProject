One of the major problems facing disability research is the difficulty of identifying differential effects of chronic conditions and impairments on capacity limitations. The identification of disabling effects is essential in understanding the extent of a work limitation as a result of the specific conditions (diseases or injuries) in different social and environmental contexts. Moreover, the purpose of social epidemiological research is to study the various capacity limitations resulting from social factors so that the research findings may enhance our understanding of the disabling effects and, in turn, may help facilitate more intelligent assessment of present needs of the rehabilitative programs dealing with different categories of the disabled.
In previous studies of disability, it was found that persons who have the same condition may not necessarily be incapacitated to the same extent, whereas those who have the same level of work limitation due to health reasons may be afflicted with different disabling conditions (Haber, 1971; Levenson and Green, 1965; Taylor and Fairrie, 1968). In analyzing data

from the Social Security Survey of the Disabled, Haber (1969) reported that, in general, the diagnostic classification of major disabling conditions was not a strong predictor of the severity of the disability. His finding has cast some doubt on the validity of using only the medical classification of health conditions as a criterion to determine the severity of the disability.
The purposes of this study are: (1) to validate Haber's findings on the disabling effects of chronic conditions; (2) to employ an epidemiological model of agent, host, and environmental factors in determining the relative influences of social epidemiological factors on the severity of disability; (3) to study the differentials in the severity of disability; and most importantly (4) to determine the nature of the differences in disabling effects of agent, host, and environmental factors for white and nonwhite disabled males.
The concept of "epidemiological triad" is used as an analytic framework for explaining the complex relationship of the disabling effects to the epidemiological triad--agent, host, and environment. In

this study, the agent factors, represented by the nature and the duration of a work limitation, are: the major disabling condition, the secondary impairment, and the length of the major disability. The host factors of the disabled are: occupation, education, and age. The environmental factors indicate work settings, using industry and residence background/residence status as indicative of exposure factors to environmental hazards.
The major hypothesis is that the severity of the disability {SD) is the function (/) of agent (A), host (H), and environmental ( £ ) factors. That is: SD = / (A, H, E) -\- error term (see Figure 1). More specifically, it is hypothesized that the extent of a work limitation (i.e., the severity of the disability) of the disabled is more strongly affected by host factors than by agent and environmental factors alone, irrespective of race.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data source for this research is the national Survey of Economic Opportunity (SEO)1 conducted in the spring of 1967 by the Bureau of the Census for the Office of Economic Opportunity. The SEO sample covered 357 primary sampling units comprising 701 counties and independent cities in the United States. The sample design consisted of two parts: (1) a selfweighting sample comprising approximately 18,000 households drawn by the same method and having the same geographic coverage as the Current Population Survey; and (2) a supplemental sample of roughly 12,000 households in predominantly nonwhite areas of large cities.
In this research, the study population was limited to civilian, noninstitutional-

The data were analyzed by dummy variable multiple regression analysis (Orcutt et al., 1961; Feldstein, 1966; Morgan et al., 1962; Shah and Abbey, 1971; Elwood et al., 1971; Suits, 1957). In this analysis, each dummy variable represents a single subclass of a factor. The individual is assigned a value of one if he belongs to the subclass, and zero if he does not. Each factor--e.g., age (ax)--is converted into a set of regressor variables (e.g., ai} a2, and a3) equivalent to the number of subclasses minus one. The use of dummy variable regression analysis does not involve making any assumptions about the linearity of the effect (Miller and Erickson, 1974). The relation between the dependent variable, severe disability ( F ) , and the independent variables (major disabling condition, secondary impairment, length of disability, etc.) is analyzed by the least squares method. For example, we are interested in knowing the effect of agent factors on severe disabilities. A regression equation is formulated as follows: Y = BtpCo-f- B±X\ -f- B2X2 . · . BIOXIQ -}- U, where Xo is a constant; Xi to X8 represent the 8 subclasses of major disabling conditions; X9 represents the variable of secondary impairment; X10 is the variable of length of the disability; and U is an unmeasured error, with E(U) = 0.
The least squares estimates (b) of the regression coefficients (B) were computed and then used for calculating the per cent deviations from average risk of having severe disabilities. The deviation measures

the increased or decreased risk (probability) of being severely disabled in a given subclass of a factor. The deviations (d) were then expressed as per cent deviation from the grand mean. The unadjusted deviations are the differences between the subclass means and the grand mean, whereas the adjusted deviations are the differences of these two means when other factors in the multivariate analysis are simultaneously controlled. Moreover, the variations between unadjusted and adjusted deviations indicate that the explanatory variables are intercorrelated. Thus, the evidence is provided that the adjustment for the spurious relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable is necessary. The per cent deviations adjusted simultaneously all variables and intercorrelations among them represent the net effect of an independent variable.
I t is important to note that we are interested in investigating the relative influence of each social epidemiological factor on the severity of the disability. The emphasis is on each factor as a whole, rather than as a subclass. Therefore, eight factors (industry, occupation, etc.) with 35 subclasses are simultaneously included in a regression equation. From this equation, beta coefficients and /""-ratios were computed using the same procedures employed by Morgan and his associates.5 Since the disabling effects of social epidemiological factors were examined independently for the white and nonwhite disabled, separate

reference period established for data on economic characteristics, or last worked, if unemployed. The activity of the establishment means the kinds of goods or services produced. The SEO data on industry referred to the work establishment in which one worked in 1966. Nine groupings of industry are: agriculture and mining; construction; manufacturing; transportation, communications, and public utilities; wholesale and retail trade; finance, insurance, real estate, business and repair services; service and miscellaneous; public administration; and industry not reported.

5Beta coefficient (representing the importance of a factor relative to other factors) is the measure of the contribution to error reduction and is computed from the square root of the weighted sum of squares of adjusted deviations divided by the standard deviation of the dependent variable. The F-test used in examining the significant effect of each factor is made by treating the adjusted deviations like a set of means and applying a simple one-way analysis of variance. The detailed procedures of the significance test have been suggested by Morgan et al. (1962).

being severely disabled when there is one standard unit of change on a particular independent variable, holding other variables as constant. For example, one unit of change on the industry scale of the white disabled will produce a concomitant net change in risk involved of being severely disabled of about 0.46. This measure is an analogue to the beta coefficient of multiple correlation, but it applies to whole sets of coefficients involved in a factor rather than a subclass of the factor. The relative influences of the eight factors were ranked in terms of the magnitude of the coefficients. However, the sign of the coefficient is not shown here, but it is indicated in the measures of the deviations. The value of rank-order correlation (Kendall T0 = 0.79) indicates that the overall relative importance of the selected factors affecting severe disabilities is not significantly different between the two disabled groups under study. However, it is worth noting that for whites, disabling conditions were found to be more influential than education in determining the risk of being severely disabled, but a reverse order of importance was found for nonwhites. Perhaps this reverse order exists

because the jobs filled by nonwhites require less education on the average so that when the major condition occurs, the chances of a nonwhite finding another job with similar or fewer educational requirements are considerably diminished.
The relative importance of secondary impairments was ranked higher for whites than for nonwhites. This finding implies that nonwhites have been largely eliminated from the job market after incurring one major disabling condition while some whites are given a second chance. An examination of the F-ratios for the coefficients shows that among the nonwhite disabled, all eight coefficients are statistically significant, but among the white disabled, only six of the eight coefficients (with the exception of two factors, length of disability and residence status/residence background) are significant.
The detailed analysis of the differentials in disabling effects of each of the eight social epidemiological factors was carried out by means of a statistical method using deviations and per cent deviations from the average risk (grand mean of 0.26 for whites, and 0.37 for nonwhites) as a basis for comparison. Measures of devia-

tions were further adjusted for all variables. The importance of each subclass of a factor was determined by the magnitude of the per cent deviation; the higher the per cent deviation, the stronger the effect (risk) on severe disabilities. A positive deviation means an individual's risk is higher than that of an average disabled person of having a severe work limitation, and vice versa.
AGENT FACTORS
In this study, agent factors refer to the major disabling condition, the secondary impairment or disability, and the length of the major disability. For both whites and nonwhites, musculoskeletal disorders and cardiovascular disorders account for approximately 57 per cent of the major disabling conditions reported by the disabled

male heads of families (Table 3). In addition, an index of dissimilarity was computed from the percentage distributions and indicated no significant differences were to be found between the two disabled populations in terms of the distributions of the disabling conditions. Among whites, the risks of having severe work limitations were higher for certain disabling conditions, i.e., cardiovascular disorders, mental illness, nervous system disorders, cancer, and visual and hearing impairments, than for the other conditions. I t appears that cancer is one of the most severely disabling conditions affecting work limitations reported by whites. Almost the same patterns were found among the nonwhite disabled, with the exception of cancer which was not reported by nonwhites. In addition, however, two more conditions,

respiratory and related disorders and diabetes, appear to be influential on severe work limitations among nonwhites.
Among those who had more than one disabling condition (about one-fifth of the disabled), the risk of being severely disabled appeared to be higher. Since the extent of work limitation is related to disability, the relationship shown in Table 4 is not surprising.
Small proportions of the disabled were identified as having a short-term work limitation: S per cent for whites and 6 per cent for nonwhites (Table 5). The fact that the duration of disability has an insignificant effect on the severity of the disability is probably a consequence of dichotomizing the factor into long-term (6

and more months) and short-term (less than 6 months) disability. A careful analysis should use a detailed breakdown of the length of disability. For both disabled populations, persons who had a short-term disability had a lower risk of being severely disabled than those who had a longterm condition.
HOST FACTORS
Host factors are characterized by an individual's occupation, education, and age. Occupation exerted a pronounced influence on the severity of the disability. The percentage distributions of occupation were quite different between whites and nonwhites. The white disabled in white-collar occupations numbered 2.5

times as many as their nonwhite counterparts, and they had a smaller risk of being severely disabled than had the latter (Table 6). There are several striking findings revealed from the adjusted deviations and their per cent deviations: (I) Laborers had a great risk of being severely disabled. (2) Farmers and farm managers for both disabled populations had a lower risk of being severely disabled than other workers. (3) Persons who did not report an occupation and were unemployed had the highest risk of being severely disabled for whites, but not for nonwhites. (4) Four occupations--clerical and sales workers, craftsmen and foremen, operatives, and services--appeared to have more risk than other occupational groups to severe work limitations for nonwhites, but not for whites.
The white disabled had higher educational levels than the nonwhite disabled. Among whites, the risk of being severely disabled was almost inversely related to

educational levels; the probability of reporting severe disabilities increased as the amount of education attained decreased (Table 7). Among nonwhites, the pattern of the relationship was erratic. However, nonwhites who had completed a high-school education were somewhat more likely to report severe disabilities than other persons with both a higher and a lower educational level. The difference between the crude risks (unadjusted per cent deviations) of the lowest and the fourth group of education factor was substantial, with a ratio of 5:1. When net risks (adjusted per cent deviations) were considered, the difference changed to a ratio of 1:2. This decreased effect of education was the result of adjustment for all variables.
Age had less effect on the severity of disability than occupation and education. About 40 per cent of all disabilities occurred in the older ages (55-64). In general, the risks of being severely disabled

increased with increasing age for both populations under study. The unadjusted per cent deviations in Table 8 indicated that younger white disabled family heads (aged 25-34) had a relatively low risk (48.9 per cent below average), whereas older family heads had a high risk (41.3 per cent above average) of having severe disabilities. The risks of nonwhite disabled family heads for the two respective age

groups were 34.1 per cent below average and 34.2 per cent above average. After simultaneous adjustment for all variables, the risk of white disabled family heads at the younger ages fell to 3.5 per cent below average and that for nonwhites to 3.9 per cent below average; the risk of whites at older ages decreased to 7.0 per cent above average and that for nonwhites to 8.1 per cent above average.

For nonwhite disabled family heads, the unadjusted per cent deviation was 20.1 per cent below average for those of a rural residence and with a rural background, and the adjusted per cent deviation was 9.4 per cent below average. The risk was therefore higher for nonwhites in the other residence categories than for those with a rural background and of a rural residence.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Haber's statement (1969) that there is no meaningful relationship between the type of disabling condition and the severity of the disability is validated in this study. The major disabling condition, one of the agent factors, had an important effect on the severity of the disability; however, its relative importance was more pronounced in white than in nonwhite disabled populations. The statistical analysis indicates the relevance of using the disabling condition as a predictor of severe disabilities, but it is insufficient to suggest that there is any meaningful link between the type of disabling condition and the severity of a work limitation. The reason for this conclusion is twofold: (1) The disabling conditions obtained

from this survey are the reporting health events, but not the outcomes of a physical or medical examination. Thus, the severity of the disability is unknown by its medical standard and, in turn, is determined by the extent of work limitations resulting from the chronic conditions and impairments. (2) The concept of severe disability has a social meaning in terms of work role and role performance that disabled persons are no longer able to work or cannot work regularly. As a result of these limitations, the type of the reported chronic condition is not meaningfully related to the severity of the disability. Furthermore, it is invalid to assume that persons with the same type of condition should have the same disabling outcomes, since other social and environmental factors may also play an important part in the disabling effect.
The influence of the secondary disability, a second important agent factor, was found significant for both white and nonwhite disabled populations. The risk of being severely disabled was greater for those who had multiple conditions than for those who reported only one work-limiting condition. Examination of the data on the length of the major disability reveals that

it is an important disabling factor for nonwhites, but not for whites. Some of the possible reasons for this finding should be explored. A white who has had a longterm condition may still be able to function (work) normally as long as he can cope with most of the difficulties, whereas a nonwhite who has had a short-term condition may play a sick role and stop working for reasons other than the medical problems. Both long-term and short-term conditions are equally detrimental to one's work role, and the fact is that if the longterm disabled have extensive training in skills appropriate for transferring or relocating to another less physically demanding job, they could have a better chance of reporting a moderate work limitation. Where these favorable characteristics are absent (that is, where the disabled are not very well trained and are unskilled workers), the relationship between severe disabilities and the length of disabilities appears to be germane.
At the onset of the disabling condition, factors such as occupation, education, and age were important because these host characteristics may help explicate the complicated phenomenon of social handicaps, or more critically speaking, social discriminations of the disabled. The analysis has shown that host factors did exert a significant influence on severities of work limitations. The most pronounced disabling effect occurred in regard to occupation, with the highest risk (39.7 per cent above average) for nonwhite laborers compared to the lowest risk (13.4 per cent below average) for farmers and farm managers in reporting severe work limitations. Thus, it appeared that the self-employed workers were less likely to be limited by the disabling condition. This interpretation is supported by the finding of Morgan et al. (1962) in studying the economic position of the disabled. Among nonwhites

whose occupations were clerical and sales, craftsmen and foremen, operatives, and services, reports from these areas were more likely to show severe disabilities. The plausible explanation for this finding may relate to the job market in that nonwhite skilled workers would be less likely to be employed if they were disabled.
An apparent inverse relationship between education and the severity of the disability was found, especially among white disabled populations. Though education appeared to be an important factor among nonwhite disabled populations, its relation to severe disabilities was not clear. For example, the risk of a nonwhite high-school graduate was almost two times that of a person with a low educational attainment in reporting a severe work limitation. The interpretation of this striking finding is made possible if we assume that vocational training at the high-school level is most important for nonwhite high-school graduates in order for them to have a low risk of being severely limited. Thus, nonwhites with sufficiently specialized skills would compensate for their lack of advanced education even though they had a work-limiting health condition.
Age is positively related to the severity of the disability, with a high risk in old ages and a low risk in young ages for both disabled populations. This finding was not unexpected since chronicity of disease advanced with age, and those who had a later onset of disease would likely be at greater risk of being unable to engage in work (Smith and Lilienfeld, 1971).
The analysis revealed that industry, an indicator of environmental characteristics, was the most significant factor of all selected variables under study. For whites, those working on construction, where heavy labor was required and many risks of being severely limited by the job were encountered, had a higher risk of being

severely disabled than those working in the other industries. For nonwhites, those who reported an industry had a considerably lower risk than those whose industry was not reported. The net effect of industry was slightly reduced, when other factors (variables) were simultaneously considered.
The disabled who were currently living in rural areas and also had a rural background had a low risk of being severely disabled compared with the average disabled person. It is possible that they faced less environmental restraint since they were more likely to have a farming occupation and work in an agricultural industry.
The central thesis of disabling effects of social epidemiological factors posits that the risk of being severely disabled is conditioned by agent, host, and environmental characteristics of the disabled. The effects of disabling conditions on work limitations cannot be clearly confirmed unless social, host, and environmental factors are also considered. Thus, researchers on disability studies who utilize the concept of the epidemiological triad as an analytic tool may find it valid and useful. However, methodologically, there were several pitfalls with respect to the dummy variable multiple regression analysis used in this study. The major problem was that the analysis violated the statistical principle of homoscedasticity assumption; therefore, the

significance tests for the R2 presented in Table 1 were not done. Secondly, the statistical tests done for the beta coefficients, which measured the relative importance of a factor and were computed from a complex multivariate procedure, were less precise than one would desire. Moreover, a rigorous statistical technique should be applied in analyzing the quantifiable rather than the qualifiable data.
Further research on the effects of disabling factors should be made by collecting pertinent data on detailed working histories and complete health information obtained from medical diagnosis and prognosis. It is also necessary to develop a rigorous statistical model to identify the disabling risk from a probabilistic approach. In addition, the interactions of agent, host, and environmental factors involved in the disabling effects should be detected and interpreted.
