Members who knew the community intimately helped with the survey, and the well-organized community charity organizations werp able to lead us to the poorest Parsis as well as to the rich. Thus, there is no reason to believe that any serious bias is caused by the 8% not included in the survey.

Response to the questionnaire was good. Almost all Parsis read and speak English; certainly at least one person in every household can do so. Many Parsis volunteered much time on all stages of the study, and almost all members of the community responded willingly.

was begun. Field work was conducted in stages between April 15 and July 15, 1965. Information was collected on a de jure basis by means of a household questionnaire designed with a separate section for each individual, including usual household members temporarily absent and temporary visitors. The form was filled out by the family, then collected, checked, and, if necessary, returned to the family by the enumerator.
1 The Karachi District Census Report for 1961 records a Parsi population of 5,018 in 1951 and 4,685 in 1961.At this rate of decrease, the population in 1965 would have been about 4,564. The present survey covered 4,198 persons, which is 92% of the population according to extrapolated census figures.

2 The quinquennial age groups were chosen because they are the ones regularly used in the Pakistan Census and other demographic studies in Pakistan. No attempt has been made to compensate for heaping and other deficiencies in the single-year age distribution which was calculated. The risk of such errors was felt to be relatively small for two reasons. First, the Parsi population is virtually 100% literate. Second, age was elicited in terms of date of birth. There may have been some heaping, especially among women, for the year of birth 1900, and possibly for the years 1910, 1920, and 1930. But there is no clear sign of misreport of birth date at these or other years.

the standard model of a "constructive pyramid" and indicates an "old" population. In fact, the median age of Parsis is 37 years, while for Muslims in Karachi it is 22 years (Hashmi, 1965, p. 31)3. The fact that the lower two bars of the pyramid are relatively short indicates a low birth rate and a proportion of children insufficient to maintain the population in the long run.
The average number of births and deaths in the community over the ten years from 1955 to 1965 can be calculated, although the

tion over this time span and comparing it to annual births and deaths produces an annual crude birth rate of 13.2 per thousand and a crude death rate of 9.5 per thousand. This means that the population is growing through natural increase at a rate of about 0.37% per year. However, analysis of Pakistan census figures of 1951 and 1961 (Central Statistical Office, 1961) indicates a decrease in the population of about 0.65% per year. The difference between the census figures and ours is probably explained by

figures for any one year are too small to provide dependable rates. For births, we counted the number of children born in eich of the years as indicated by survivors in ages 0-9 enumerated in 1965, plus those who had died in the ten years previous, to 1965. Information on the total number of deaths at all ages per year is available from the dependable community records on deaths and funeral ceremonies.4

emigration out of the community. According to census figures, about 10.2 persons per thousand, or 48 persons apparently leave the community every year. It was not possible to collect reliable data on migration patterns, nor do the census data permit application of "reverse survival" techniques to estimate net migration. The high rate of outmigration is the price the community pays
4 The Parsi dead are disposed of at a single site by exposure to the elements and birds of prey, and there is virtually no chance that a death and the attending funeral could pass unnoticed by the community clerk, who keeps careful records of these events. He also records deaths of members temporarily away from Karachi, whether or not the body is returned.

for the high priority it puts on education, financial gain, and general adoption of Western customs. It is responsible to a large extent for the steady decrease in the Parsi population.
It is common knowledge within the Parsi community and among demographers concerned with populations in the subcontinent that the birth, death, and growth rates of the Parsi population are strikingly low. C. Chandra Sekar's important paper of 1948 indicated a similar situation among Bombay Parsis in 1948. Although most of Chandra Sekar's discussion deals with data covering the years 1901 to 1941, he also made some predictions about future development in the demographic picture for the Parsi community in Bombay. I t is interesting to compare his predictions for the much larger community in Bombay with the results of our Karachi survey.
Chandra Sekar predicted that the Bombay community would increase slightly in size between 1941 and 1951 and begin to decrease within the next decade. He estimated that between 1951 and 1971 the population would decrease by about 4%. This decrease of 0.4% per year seems to be slightly pessimistic, since the present study, dealing with approximately the same years, found a minimal growth of about 0.4% per year. However, we should note that these data are not dependable enough to quibble over, and in any case their close approximation is apparently fortuitous since Chandra Sekar's estimates of birth and death rates for the 1960's do not correspond to our results. Using census figures from 1941, Chandra Sekar figured a birth rate of 19.4 per thousand per year for the Parsi community in Bombay and a death rate of 15.1, and he predicted that both would remain stationary. In Karachi in 1965, both were considerably lower, the birth rate being 13.2 per thousand and the death rate 9.5 per thousand, although they still bear approximately the same relationship to each other.

I t may be that Chandra Sekar's dire forecasts about the diminution of the Parsi community will yet prove correct, but the decrease may start later and proceed more rapidly than he expected. The population pyramids which Chandra Sekar constructed to illustrate his estimates of the Parsi population at ten year intervals from 1951 to 2001 are all quite rectangular, suggesting a static demographic situation. On the other hand, an extrapolation from the pyramid in Figure 1 of this paper would show a topheavy population dropping rapidly in numbers by the year 2001.
The masculinity ratios of the different age groups of the Parsi population are also shown in Table 1. It is interesting to note that this pyramid does not reveal the high ratio of young males evident in the Muslim population of Karachi, where many men immigrate for jobs, leaving their wives and children in the villages. Indeed, the ratio of Parsi males in the 20-24 and 25-34 cohorts is unusually low, which may indicate that the out-migration previously mentioned has been male-selective in these ages. There is also the troubling fact that the masculinity ratios for age groups 0-4 and 5-9 and 10-14 are well above what one might intuitively expect in such a relatively closed population.
Taken at face value the high masculinity ratio indicates either a young female selective out-migration, which from our other knowledge of the community is highly unlikely, or it indicates higher female than male mortality at the lower ages. The latter explanation for abnormally high masculinity ratios is often employed for India and Pakistan and justified by the argument that, with the higher regard accorded males, female children are neglected (Rakunudin, 1967). No such negating of the importance of females seems a part of Parsi tradition, and since overall mortality rates are very low, excess female mortality seems an unlikely explanation in this case. Age-heaping or female-selective underenumeration might ex-

plain the discrepancy, but neither se;ms highly probable in a literate, cooperative group such as the Parsi community.
The dependency ratio of the Parsi pc pulation is much lower than the dependency ratio of Karachi Muslims. Thanks to higher life expectancy in their community, there are almost five times as many people over 65 per hundred workers (persons aged 15 to 64) among the Parsis as among Muslims (1.6.8 compared to 3.5). But there are more than twice as many children aged 0-14 per woi ker in the Muslim population than there are among Parsis (71.7 compared to 29.4).

lives with the boy's family for a few months or a year, but before children are born they usually set up housekeeping on their own. Table 2 shows that 80% of young families now live separately from other relatives. Some 70% of the middle-aged population live in nuclear-family units, but only 50% of the older population. Most striking is the difference between generations in joint families. Of the two younger groups, only 5% live in joint families, while almost 25% of families with household heads over the age of 55 live in joint families.
There is no doubt that this shift to

Overall, in the Parsi community there are about 46 dependents for every hundred workers, while in the general populatioi. of Karachi in 1961 the proportion is 75 per hundred workers. This fact probably contributes to the relative prosperity of the Parsis.
The survey counted 4,198 persons in '?84 families, making an average of 4.3 persons per family. A "family" is denned as a group of persons living under the same roof and sharing the same kitchen. In the Parsi community in Karachi, the traditional joint and extended families are losing popularity to the smaller nuclear family, which provides more privacy and independence for the young couple. A newly-married couple often

nuclear families can often have a disruptive effect on the cohesiveness of the community. Nevertheless, the familial ties still seem close. In many cases related families live in separate flats in the same building, fathers and sons or sons-in-law may still work together, and there is constant inter-visitation and cooperation of many kinds.
Among other interesting characteristics of the Parsi family is the fact that in almost a fourth of the families, a woman is considered the head of the household. In most cases it is an older woman whose husband has died. (The median age for male household heads is 46 years; for women it is 55.) In most other traditional groups, the eldest male would usually be the head of the house-

hold. The fact that women are given this role is another sign of the status and respect which Parsis accord their women.
RESIDENCE AND MOBILITY
Compared with the Muslim population, 90% of which have come to Karachi since Partition in 1947, the Parsis are an old established community in Karachi. About 28% of Parsi families indicated that their forebears have lived in Karachi for at least a century. Some 19% replied "unknown" to this question, and there is a high probability that a large proportion of this group are also

facility in the late nineteenth century, and modern commercial Karachi emerged in the ensuing decades. No wave of Parsi immigration is associated with the Partition of 1947. In fact, Parsi immigration dropped off radically just when Muslim immigration was rising to its peak, and only 5% of Parsi families settled in the period 1950 to 1965. There are no figures on Parsi emigration from Karachi to India at the time of Partition, but the general impression among Karachi Parsis is that emigration also was negligible. On the whole, the Parsis had political and economic reasons to stay where

old families, since when the family had been in Karachi for generations, the respondent was less likely to know the exact data of original settlement. The fact that many Parsi families have lived in Karachi for many generations has perhaps helped them to become relatively well-established and prosperous.
A wave of Parsi immigration to Karachi from India seems to have occurred during the first half of this century. Some 29% of the families indicated the period 1900 to 1929 as their settlement date in Karachi. Probably an important motive was the establishment of business enterprises (branches of Parsi firms in Bombay, in particular) in Karachi. The British began developing Karachi as a major military depot and port

they were during the Muslim-Hindu population movements.
The data collected on mobility reveal that members of the Parsi community are less mobile than might be expected (see Table 3). In the query about change of residence within a year and within five years, the mobility revealed is extremely low. In fact, many Parsis have lived in the same house for twenty-five years or more. Even upward mobility has not typically been followed by parallel shifts in housing, as is common is Western society. The more recent moves of households heads under the age of 35 probably reflect the establishment of new homes after marriage. Once settled, these young families may also be expected to live in the same place for many years.

EDUCATION
Education is evidently important to the Parsis. It is clear from Table 4 that almost all school-age children in the Parsi community attend schools, a fact which sharply distinguishes them from the total school-age population of Karachi. It appears that beys tend to start slightly earlier, at age six, while many girls do not begin school until they are seven.
I t used to be that a large number of clildren could be expected to drop out of school after they had completed their "Matric," corresponding to the tenth year of school. This resulted in a break in the percentage attending school at age fifteen or sixteen. Now, however, more students go on to we rk for "Intermediate" and higher degrees. Table 4 shows that the drop in percentage attending school occurs at age 18 for girls,

19 for boys. Boys remain in school longer than girls. There were only 2 out of 175 women over the age of twenty-four still in school, while there were 16 out of 152 men.
Analysis of the number of school years completed by adults over twenty-five years of age also indicated that both men and women have made educational gains over the last three generations. The biggest change is in women's education. Out of thirty women with no formal education, twentyone are over 55 years of age and several of the remaining nine women may be more uneducable than uneducated. Three-fourths of women with four or fewer years of schooling are over 55 years old. Women made a substantial gain of three years in the median number of school years completed between "grandmother's" generation and

ty-five is eleven years; for all women, ten
years.
The same trend toward more education,
especially for women, is revealed in data on
attainment of degrees. While virtually no
woman over 55 had more than ten years of
formal schooling, nearly a fifth of the women
in the 25-34 cohort have degrees higher than
the Bachelor of Arts. In recent years more
5 Some informants observed that this development caused some discomfort in the community because these young girls were now equipped to get well-paying jobs, and this disrupted their traditional position in the marriage market. Our data on marriage show that the median age at first marriage was considerably older for women in the 35-54 age group than for older women.

men have also been working for higher degrees. In higher education, the Parsi community is ahead of the Muslim population.
LABOR FORCE CHARACTERISTICS
The labor force characteristics of the Parsi community are quite unlike those of most communities of the subcontinent. Tables 5 and 6 show the breakdown of employment and occupations.
It is notable that very few Parsis under the age of twenty are in the labor force. In most subcontinental communities the tendency is to put children to work at least by the time they are in their teens. Even the male participation rate in the 20-24 cohort is relatively low, reflecting the fact that men stay in school longer.
Our definition of "working" does not include "housewife." One-fourth of Parsi women between 15 and 64 years of age work in jobs away from home (full or part-time), as compared with some 5% of Muslim women in Karachi. Almost half the Parsi women between 20 and 24 years of age (usually unmarried) have jobs. The percentage drops off gradually until in the 45-54 cohort only one-fourth of the women work and in later years less than a tenth. Unfortunately, since no earlier statistics exist, it is impossible to ascertain from these figures whether more women are working now than used to, although the notion in the community is that this is the case.
Other persons "not working" are students, young girls awaiting marriage, a few persons disabled or looking for jobs, and retired men.
Most Parsis (76%) work for private employers. Our figures unfortunately do not reveal what proportion of employers are themselves Parsis, but casual observation suggests that the number is substantial.
A large proportion of Parsis (18%) are self-employed, and among males aged 55 and over the figure rises to 27%. Some 5% work for "other employers" which includes primarily the government, and the com-

is not reached until age 32. The youngest widow is 28 years old; the youngest widower, 52 years old. There are 268 widows in the community, 45 of whom are under 55 years of age; and 55 widowers, of whom only two are under 55 years old. The relative longevity of women partially explains the difference. Moreover, following the Hindu pattern, most widowed Parsi women would not marry again, while widowed men might well do so.

The median age at first marriage among the Karachi Parsis has fluctuated widely in the last forty years for both men and women. Fifteen females aged 55 and over at the time of the survey reported being married when less than fifteen years of age, while only two from age group 35-54 and one from the age groups under 35 were less than fif-

* No one under the age of twenty had ever been married.

Divorce and separation, strongly disapproved of in the community, are likely to have been under-reported. Our figures show eight divorced women and three divorced men. The discrepancy may result from the fact that the divorced husbands are more likely to have moved away or to have married again.
The percentage of married Parsis is unusually low. Among females 20 years and over, 56.6% were currently married compared to 73.5% for all Karachi Muslims (Hashmi, 1965, p. 44).6About 74.4% of Parsi

first marriage in the youngest group is mi ;leading, because some of the single women in this cohort will eventually marry, thus raising the median agefor the whole group. The same explanation applies to the apparent drop in ageat marriage for the youngeiit cohort of men. The data show 26 years us the median age at first marriage for men under 35years of age, but informal observation suggests that when all thesingle men in this group have married who ever will the median age will not be much less than ;0

difference in age at first marriage has a substantial effect on fertility (Coale and Tye, 1961).
There is a further unproved possibility that inbreeding among the Parsis may lead to lower fertility. Although some Parsi couples may practice family planning for spacing or for limitation of family size, there is every indication that theParsis as a group do not have such a low fertility rate by choice, although at one time some of them wanted to control reproduction for financial and eugenic purposes (Chandra Sekar, 1948, p. 89). I t was not possible to collect information on symptoms of inbreeding or on family-planning practices.

assume on the whole that the fertile years are over for women over 44 years of age and that these figures represent completed fertility. There is some slight indication of a downward trend in completed fertility when age groups 65 and over, 55-64, and 45-54 are compared, but it is dubious because of the problem of recall in such a retrospective question. In any case, Parsi completed fertility, even taking the highest of these figures, is only about 60% of the comparable figure for Muslims in Karachi.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The survey of the Parsi population of Karachi succeeded in verifying one accepted belief about the demographic character of the community. It is a small, endogamous population, dwindling in size because the relatively low death rate is matched by a birth rate astonishingly low for an Asian population. These patterns lead to a very low dependency ratio, which may contribute to the prosperity of the community, but coupled with considerable out-migration from the community they mean that this small community is shrinking in overall size.
As far as family and occupation are concerned, the Parsis exhibit behavior familiar in Asia. The nuclear family is becoming more popular as the members of the community become more Westernized. Parsis remain loyal to their traditional occupational fields: auditing and accounting, banking, clerical work, and trade and transportation.
In the field of education the Parsis have led the way for their compatriots. Virtually every Parsi over five years of age has had some formal education, and the trend is toward increasingly higher education for men and women alike.
The mobility patterns of the Parsis are unique in Karachi. While most Muslims are new arrivals in the city and apparently move fairly often, 75% of Parsi families have been in Karachi since before Partition

and many have stayed in the same home for generations.
The great anomaly presented by the Parsi community is the conflict between its precarious demographic position and its rules of endogamy and nonconversion. The death rate among Parsis is very low and bears witness to the advanced state of education, medical care, and community charity. At the same time, the percentage of Parsis married is low, age at marriage is relatively high, and the birth rate is very low. The out-migration rate is high because higher education and experience with Western customs attract many young people away from the community where occupational and marital opportunities are limited and personal freedom sometimes conflicts with community traditions.
One could argue that the very realization of these facts by the community might set in motion forces sufficient to check the downward trend, for even a modest rise in the proportion of females marrying or a slight fall in the average age at marriage for females might be enough to restore demographic vitality to the community. A small decrease in emigration, which occurs primarily among men in the 20 to 30 year age group, might lead to the needed improvement in the marriage market. In 1948, C. Chandra Sekar believed it possible for the community to reverse its demographic fate, and he wrote in a reforming spirit of the birth-rate problem and the steps Parsis should take to overcome it. A popular version of the same story written by a prominent Parsi in the same year was widely publicized within the community in Bombay and Karachi (Desai, 1948). A paper by Maneck B. Pithawalla and Beheram Rustomji, published in 1945, carried the same message. But the community did not respond to these warnings, and in the meantime the number of persons leaving the community has increased.

The dilemma is a difficult one. An improvement in the demographic situation--a drop in theaverage ageof marriage for women and an increase in the total number of women marrying--would probably require both men and women to sacrifice some rscent educational and occupational gains. Young people would have to resist the temptation to leave the community. But it isnot reasonable to expect that this will happen unless the more restrictive community customs, particularly the endogamy and noiconversion rules, are relaxed to some exte:it to enhance the attractiveness of communi ;y life and broaden the marital possibilities open to females. This, in turn, might fundamentally change the character of community relations. Thus, the Karachi Parsi com-

munity finds itself in the classic dilemma of all exclusive, traditional societies.
