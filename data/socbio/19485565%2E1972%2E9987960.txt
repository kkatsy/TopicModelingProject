One of the most fundamental features of any population is the distribution of its members according to age. As noted elsewhere (Stockwell, 1964), almost any aspect of human behavior, from subjective attitudes and physiological capabilities to objective characteristics such as income, labor force participation, occupation, or group membership, may be expected to vary with age. Further, the specific needs and problems of a given society, both now and in the future, will in large part be determined by the age structure of its population.
A population with a high proportion of young persons, for example, may be expected to differ from one that has a high proportion of older members in its productive capacity, in its attitudes toward various socioeconomic and political issues, in its tastes and consumption patterns, and in its particular needs and problems. The measurement of labor force efficiency and the determination of productive capacity require reference to the number of persons within the active adult ages in relation to the number outside these ages, both young and old.
The adequacy of facilities such as housing, schools, and convalescent hospitals de-

pends, respectively, on the number of young people who are marrying and starting their families, the number of school- and preschool-age children, and the number of older persons. Levels of fertility and mortality in a population, and consequently its rate of natural increase, will be influenced by its age composition. The number and proportion of elderly people in a society has important implications for problems of old age security such as jobs for older workers, medical and health benefits, and pensions for the aged. For these as well as many other reasons that could be cited (Bogue, 19S9, p. 92-94), a knowledge of the current age structure, how it came into being, and what its consequences are likely to be for future population trends is essential as a basis both for determining present needs and for adequate planning with regard to the future needs of a population.
TRENDS IN MEDIAN AGE
The most commonly used summary measure of whether a population is young or old, and how its age composition has been changing, is the median age. The median age of the American population at each census since 1900 is presented in Table 1.

THE LIFE CYCLE
Although median age is a useful measure for providing a general indication of the age composition of a population, it is of limited value in more detailed analyses. The procedure commonly followed when greater precision is desired is to examine the proportions of the population falling into particular age groups. Here it is useful to designate three broad age groups which may be assumed to correspond roughly to the three major stages of the life cycle: youth (under IS years); adulthood (15 to 64 years); and old age (65 years and over). The composition of the nation's population according to these three broad age groups is also presented in Table 1. These data clearly depict the major changes that have occurred in each stage of the life cycle during the present century.
Prior to the 1940-50 decade, a major trend was a consistent decline in the proportion of the population under 15 years of age. At the beginning of the present century slightly more than one out of every three persons in the United States fell into this age group, but by 1940, after several decades of declining birth rates, this ratio had fallen to one in four. Since 1940, however, the erratic pattern of fertility has resulted in two reversals of this trend. First, the postwar baby boom led to an increase in the proportion of youth, especially during the 1950's, and by 1960 the number of persons under 15 years of age was once again roughly one out of three. The sharp declines in fertility during the most recent decade, however, have brought about another decline in this proportion--to 28.4% in 1970.
For the adult ages, the effect of the fluctuating fertility trend of the present century was the reverse of its effect on the relative size of the youth group. As the proportion of youth fell during the years of declining

fertility the proportion of the population 15 to 64 years of age increased, from 62% in 1900 to 68% in 1940. Between 1940 and 1960, as a consequence of the higher fertility of the postwar baby boom, the per cent of the population falling into these active adult ages declined to a level below that existing at the beginning of the century; however, the renewed fertility decline of the 1960's has led to the emergence of a new upward trend. At the time of the most recent census, approximately 62% of the American population was between the ages of 15 and 64 years, an increase of some 2 percentage points over the 1960 figure.
The major difference between the 1970 population and that at the beginning of the century is found in the proportion of elderly persons. In 1970 the percentage of the population 65 years of age and over was well over twice as great as it was in 1900-- 9.8% as opposed to only 4.1% at the turn of the century. Iri terms of absolute numbers the change has been even more striking. In 1900 there were slightly more than three million persons age 65 and over in the United States; by 1970 this number had swelled to more than twenty million, representing nearly a six-fold increase during the preceding seventy years.
THE AGING TREND
A particularly useful technique for depicting more precisely the changes that have taken place with respect to the older segment of the population is the index of aging, which may be defined as the number of persons age 65 and over per 100 children under 15 years of age. These indexes have been calculated by the author for the United States from 1900 to 1970 and are presented in Table 2. Inspection of these data indicates that prior to the 1950-60 decade the aging index had increased during each decennial interval, with the increase being particularly marked between 1920

effect with respect to halting the historical aging of the American population. Whether or not it will have an additional impact depends solely on the future fertility of the earlier baby boom cohorts themselves as they take over the main reproductive ages during the coming decade.
DEPENDENCY
Another tool for depicting the changes that have taken place with respect to the age composition of the population is the dependency ratio, or the number of persons under IS and over 65 years of age per 100 persons in the age group 15 to 64 years. This measure provides a crude indication of the average number of persons which each 100 adults would be required to support and care for // the dependency load was equally divided among the adult population, and if all persons under 15 and over 65 could be regarded as economically dependent upon the rest of the population. Neither of these conditions is met completely, however, and the degree to which they are approximated varies among different population groups and at different periods of time. Nevertheless, in spite of its limitations as an economic indicator, this ratio is very useful for making general comparisons and for indicating some of the consequences of changes in age composition.
According to the data presented in Table 2 the total dependency ratio in the United States declined during the early decades of the twentieth century; between 1900 and 1940 the number of dependents under 15 and over 65 per 100 persons age 15-64 fell from 62.6 to 46.8, or by 25%. From 1940 to 1960, however, there was a marked increase in the burden of dependency, and the 1960 ratio of 67.6 dependents per 100 active adults was the highest ever attained during the present century. Since that time, a downward trend has reappeared, and the

1970 dependency ratio (61.7) is almost 10% below what it was in 1960.
The main reason that the dependency ratio has fluctuated since 1940 lies in the changes in the relative size of the younger population. This can readily be seen by considering the total dependency ratio in terms of its component parts: youth dependency, or the number of children under 15 per 100 persons 15-64 years of age; and aged dependency, or the number 65 and over per 100 age 15-64. When these component ratios are examined, two conclusions are apparent. First, there has been a steady and consistent increase in aged dependency since 1900. In 1970 there were nearly 16 older dependents per 100 adults, or well over twice as many as there had been at the beginning of the century. Second, the trend in youth dependency has been erratic and parallels closely the fertility trends since 1900. That is, youth dependency declined steadily up to 1940; it increased markedly (by 42%) between 1940 and 1960 as a result of the postwar baby boom era; and it declined during the present decade as a response to the downward fertility trend of the 196O's. Clearly, the fluctuating birth rate of the past 25 years has had a profound effect on the age structure of the American population.
DETAILED CHANGES SINCE 1960
With three notable exceptions, each age group in the United States population showed an increase over 1960 (see Table 3). Two of the exceptions (ages 30-34 and 35-39 years, which showed a decrease during the decade of 4% and 10% respectively) represent the passing into an older age of the generation that was born during the period of low birth rates in the 1930's. The other exception, a decline of nearly 16% in the size of the population under 5 years of age, clearly reveals the magnitude

of the recent "birth dearth" in the United States. The impact of this recent fertility decline is also reflected in the relatively small increase in the 5-9 year age group.
Reflecting the high level of fertility of the 194S-SS baby boom decade, the greatest increases were for ages 15-19 (45%) and 20-24 (58%). The biggest increase noted for any group, both numerically and in percentage terms, characterized the group aged 20-24 years which grew by more than 6 million between 1960 and 1970.
The population at ages 40-64 also increased at each age group during the decade, but nowhere was the increase as great as that noted for the young adult population. Increments at these older ages ranged from approximately 3 % for the group 40-44 years old (who were also born at a time when fertility was relatively low) to just over 20% for persons aged 60-64 years. Further, as noted in earlier sections, the older population has also gained fairly heavily in recent years. In 1970, there were more than 20 million persons age 65 and over in the United States, or 2 1 % more than were enumerated in 1960.

To summarize briefly: Between 1960 and 1970 the population of the United States experienced fairly rapid gains at the young adult and older ages, especially the former. However, for the middle-age adults (the age 30-39 survivors of the Depression birth cohorts), numbers declined. Finally, there was a substantial decline (16%) in the size of the child population under 5 years of age. This decline was not anticipated a few years age, due to the expected increase in the number of young adults having babies, and has come about because of the marked fertility declines of the 1960's. This development, which is perhaps the most noteworthy change in the American age structure over the past decade, clearly reveals the very close association between the trend in fertility and the trend in the age composition of a population.
OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE
In speculating about the future trend in the age composition of the American population, the most important thing to keep in mind is that the age structure in the years

war baby boom cohorts began to reach age 20; and by the end of the 1970 decade it is estimated that the number of women 20-34 years of age will have increased from 21.1 million in 1970 to 28.8 million in 1980, or by 36% (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1968). In other words, 1980 will see nearly eight million more potential mothers than there were in 1970. Thus, unless the present low birth rates decline even further, to levels never before experienced in the United States, the substantially larger number of potential mothers in the coming decade will result in a significant increase in the absolute number of births, a continuation of the current low median age, and very likely another reversal in the recently reinstated aging trend.

It is still far too early to reach any kind of definite conclusion with respect to the future course of American fertility and its effect on the age composition of the population. If recent downward trends in fertility continue even further, the declining trend in median age could be reversed and the aging trend could become even more pronounced. On the other hand, a constant level of fertility in the face of the fairly large increase in the number of potential mothers could result in an increase in the number of births and another slowing down, perhaps even a reversal, of the present aging trend. Any increases in fertility among women age 20-34 years during the coming decade would, of course, lead to a marked increase in births and in the proportion of
