This paper compares the variations in fertility among women in Mexico City, Mexico, with those among women in Caracas, Venezuela, in relation to certain factors such as age at marriage, education of woman, occupation of husband, labor force status of women, religiosity, and ideal and desired number of children.
DATA AND METHODS
The data for this paper are based on fertility surveys conducted by CELADE (Centro Latinoamericano de Demografia) during 1963-64. These surveys included capital cities and selected small urban and rural areas in seven Latin American countries. The objectives of these surveys and a preliminary analysis of fertility in relation to certain factors have been reported for three of the cities by Miro and Rath (1965). Later, Miro and Mertens (1968) analyzed fertility in relation to socioeconomic and attitudinal factors for all areas covered in the surveys. Among other studies based on the CELADE fertility surveys two are especially pertinent since they deal with data similar to those examined in this paper. One study is on the reproductive behavior of women in Mexico City, (Benitez Zenteno, 1970) and the

other deals with the fertility of women in the Metropolitan Area of Caracas (Direction General de Estadistica y Censos Nacionales, 1967).
This paper is concerned with the reproductive behavior of ever-married women. The surveyed women in common-law marriages in Mexico City and Caracas are not considered in this paper because they are too few for the necessary cross-classifications. Thus, this paper is concerned primarily with factors related to the fertility of ever-married women, i.e., those in or previously in legal unions.
The analysis utilizes the cross-sectional method and the multiple regression technique. The cross-sectional method includes mostly ever-married women. In the regression technique, the data are restricted to married women with husband present. Attention may first be given to the cumulative fertility of women in the two cities.
Cumulative fertility. It may be noticed from Table 1 that the cumulative fertility rates for all women and for ever-married women tend to be higher in Mexico City than in Caracas. For total women, the excess is largest at ages 40-44 (29%) and nonexistent at ages 30-34. Among those ever-married women in Mexico City 25-

29, 40-44 and 4 5 ^ 9 years old, the excess in fertility over their counterparts in Caracas was by more than one child. The considerably lower fertility of ever-married women in Caracas may perhaps be explained by the relatively high percentage of foreign-born (20%) in the population compared with a low percentage (2%) in Mexico City. The foreign-born persons in Caracas are of European extraction; they came to Venezuela either shortly before or after World War II. They are generally better educated and less fertile than the native population. Since Mexico City is a large, industrialized, modern city, one might have expected lower fertility there than in Caracas at least for women at younger ages. However, even young -women in Mexico City are quite fertile. The available data do not offer an explanation for the relatively high fertility of women in Mexico City.
The average fertility differences between Mexico City and Caracas became even more striking in the distributions of women by number of children ever born. Thus, in Mexico City in 1964 the percentage childless among ever-married

women 45-49 years old was 3.7% compared with 6.3% in Caracas and the percentage of women with six or more children in Mexico City was 37.6% compared with 33.2% in Caracas.
To gain a better understanding of the fertility pattern of women in Mexico City and Caracas, it may be useful to examine the parity progression ratios. It should be mentioned that the parity progression ratios cannot be considered final except in the case of women who completed childbearing. As expected, the parity progression ratios for women in Mexico City and Caracas tend to decline with increasing birth order. Nevertheless, the ratios tend to be higher for Mexico City than Caracas at the various ages and parities. For women in Caracas the 4 to 5 ratio was lower than 3 to 4 ratio for all except two of the five-year age groups considered, whereas for women in Mexico City this held true for only three of the age groups (see Table 2).
In measuring fertility, it is important to consider age at marriage. Age at marriage is, of course, simply the difference between current age and the number of years

since the (first) marriage. In general, the younger the woman marries, the more children she has. First, women who marry at an early age are at risk of childbearing for a longer time than those who marry later. Also they are usually of lower socioeconomic status, characteristics that are associated with high fertility.

We may notice from Table 3 that the cumulative fertility of ever-married women standardized for age declines sharply with increasing age at marriage in both Mexico City and Caracas. Again, however, the fertility rates are higher for Mexico City women than for Caracas women of comparable age and age at marriage. Specifi-

cally, the excess of the fertility rate for women, in Mexico City over that in Caracas is 10% for those who married at ages below 18, 19% for those who married at ages 18-19, 22% for those who married at ages 20-21, and 39% for those married at ages 25 and over. The data in Table 3 suggest that an efficient way of lowering fertility is through an increasing age at marriage. The latter is accomplished by raising the level of educational attainment, a factor that is next considered.
Education. Among social factors influencing fertility, education is frequently mentioned as the most important. In general, fertility is inversely related to education. Women of high educational attainment tend to be less fertile than those of low education. First, they tend to marry later and, second, they are more efficient in controlling family size. It may be noticed from Table 4 that at all educational levels fertility rates are higher for evermarried women in Mexico City than for those in Caracas. The excess is greatest at the lowest educational level and smallest at the highest levels. Thus, ever-married women in Mexico City with secondary or university education are but little more fertile than women of corresponding educational attainment in Caracas.
It may be of interest to note that in Mexico City and Caracas ever-married

women of low educational attainment contributed the highest proportion of children ever born to their respective age groups, For example, in Mexico City among women 25-29 years old 69% had no more than primary schooling but contributed 75% of all births to this age group. A similar situation prevailed in Caracas. There, among ever-married women 25-29 years old, 68% had at most primary schooling but contributed 74% of all births to this age group. Among women 35-39 years old
in Mexico City, 72% had no more than primary school but had borne 78% of all children to this age group, whereas in Caracas among the 35-39 age group 75% had no more than primary schooling but contributed 78% of all births. Of women 45-49 years old in Mexico City, 74% had at most primary schooling but contributed 83% of all births, whereas among women of comparable age in Caracas 84% had at most primary school education but had produced 90% of all births to this age group.
Husband's occupation. It has long been noted that occupation of husband has a bearing on fertility of the woman. The major difficulty arising from the use of husband's occupation is that a person often does not remain in the same occupation during his lifetime; it often happens that the occupation of husband at the time of

the survey is not the same as at the time of the birth of the child. Without complete occupational histories it is impossible to make corrections and to know the extent of these changes in the occupation.
Despite these difficulties, the relationship between husband's occupation and fertility is revealing. It is a well-established fact that the occupational status like educational attainment is inversely related to fertility. This holds true for Mexico City and Caracas. Also, at each occupational level the fertility of couples in Mexico City surpassed that of couples in Caracas. As with education, the per cent excess was inversely related to occupational class. Women in Mexico City whose husbands were in higher nonmanual occupations were by 11% more fertile than women whose husbands were in the corresponding occupational group in Caracas; the excess increased to 26% for wives with husbands in lower nonmanual occupations and reached 3 1 % for wives with husbands in manual occupations (see Table 5).

low fertility for whatever reason and thus have the freedom to work. There are still other women who work because they have more children than their husbands can support. The problem of causal sequences can be resolved only in a longitudinal study.
From the data shown in Table 6 it may be noticed that relatively small proportions of women in Mexico City and in Caracas are working either at home or outside the home. First, the majority of women in Mexico City and in Caracas do not have the necessary skills to be gainfully employed, and second, the norms of the society do not encourage married women to be gainfully employed. Nevertheless, ever-married women who work outside the home are much less fertile than those who do not work. In Mexico City, the age-standardized cumulative fertility of wives working at home is 6% higher than that of nonworking wives (Table 6). One could speculate that wives working at home do mostly semiskilled or unskilled

Employment of wife. The relationship between fertility and the wife's work history is difficult to interpret not only because of the age factor but also, and primarily, because of the interrelations between fertility and employment. Many women wish to work and therefore try to restrict their fertility. Other women have

work and belong to a socioeconomic group associated with high fertility. In Caracas, the data follow the expected pattern more clearly but not completely. Nonworking wives have the higest fertility but the rate for wives working at home is actually a little lower than that for wives working outside the home. Each of the last two

rates, however, is based on relatively small numbers.
Table 7 presents age-specific fertility rates by employment status of wives. The last column shows per cent excess of the fertility of the nonworking wives over that of working wives. It may be noticed that in Mexico City the average cumulative fertility of nonworking wives is 2% lower than that of working wives and the fertility of nonworking wives 20-24 years old is 3 % lower than that of working wives

in the corresponding age group. In most of the older ages, the difference is in the other direction but the excess fertility of the nonworking wives does not exceed 14%.
In contrast, the excess fertility of nonworking wives is quite large in Caracas. In the age group 20-24, the nonworking wives in Mexico City show a 3 % deficit in fertility compared with a 65% excess in fertility for the corresponding age group of wives in Caracas. At ages 45-49, the

fertility of the nonworking wives in Mexico City is 1% lower than that of working wives, whereas the fertility of the nonworking wives in Caracas in the comparable age group is 42% in excess of that of working wives (Table 7). Our data do not afford an explanation of the fertility behavior of working wives in Mexico City. As already noticed, in Mexico City in contrast to Caracas there is in general a rather small excess in fertility of nonworking over working wives. To find an answer to this puzzling problem one probably should study the family structure in Mexico City.
Religiosity. Religion is almost universally found to be an important factor affecting the reproductive behavior of couples. This may be particularly true of Catholicism because the Catholic doctrine teaches couples not to prevent births of children except for important reasons. In addition, there are official prohibitions against the use of artificial means of birth control, and this makes family planning difficult for Catholics who respect these proscriptions. There is, for example, in the United States a persistent excess in fertility among Catholic couples as compared with other religious groups. In the United States the frequency of church attendance tends to be directly related to fertility, especially among Catholics. However, church attendance is only one component of religiosity (Ryder and Wes-

toff, 1971, p. 71). In this paper, religiosity is measured by frequency of church attendance. Its scale is: once a week or more, once or twice a month, less often, never, not stated, no religion. The last three categories were excluded in our tabulations because of very few cases.
The relationship between age-standardized cumulative fertility and religious participation is shown in Table 8. As noticed, in Mexico City the cumulative fertility of wives attending church once a week or more is lower than that of wives attending church once or twice a month or "less often." The fertility of wives in the last two categories is practically the same. In Caracas there is no difference between fertility of wives attending church once a week or more or once or twice a month. However, wives who attend church "less often" show a 3 1 % excess in fertility over those who attend church once or twice a month.
In an attempt to explain this peculiar relationship, the data on church attendance were cross-classified by education. In Table 9, age-standardized fertility is shown for ever-married women cross-classified by education and religious participation. Because of the few cases, the three categories "some secondary, completed secondary and some university" were combined. It may be noted from Table 9 that in Mexico City and in Caracas wives with "none or

some primary education" who attend church once a week or more tend to have lower fertility than those who attend church once or twice a month. And those in turn who attend church once or twice a month tend to have lower fertility than those who attend church "less often." Thus, those who attend church "less often" have the highest fertility among the three categories. A plausible explanation for this type of behavior may be that women with low educational attainment who have fewer children are able to attend church services more often than those in the same educational class with more children.
In Mexico City and in Caracas, women ever married with completed primary education and also those with secondary and university education do not show a consistent relationship between frequency of church attendance and fertility. For example, women in Mexico City with completed primary school who attend church services once a week or more are the most fertile. Those who attend church services "less often" are less fertile, and those who

attend services once or twice a month are the least fertile. In contrast, in Caracas women ever married with completed primary education who attend church "less often" are the most fertile, those who attend church once a week or more are less fertile, and those who attend church once or twice a month are the least fertile.
Contrary to expectations, in Mexico City and Caracas there is no consistent positive relationship between the frequency of church attendance and fertility. Moreover, women with fewer children attend church services more frequently than those with more children. The lack of a direct association between fertility and church attendance cannot be attributed to the fact that better educated women are more participating. The foregoing analysis seems to indicate that frequency of church attendance in itself does not directly influence fertility. There are probably other intervening factors that neutralize the effect of religiosity on fertility. A similar conclusion was reached by Gomez in his analysis of the data on San Jose obtained

468

Davidson

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

from the 1964 CELADE fertility survey (Gomez, 1968). In contrast, a study prepared by the Demographic Division of the Venezuelan Census Office (Direction General de Estadistica y Censos Nacionales, 1967) based on the 1964 fertility survey concluded that there exists an inverse relationship between frequency of church attendance and fertility.
The attitudes of ever-married women in Mexico City and Caracas toward family size are discussed in this section. Attitudes toward and desires concerning family size were studied in the United States for the first time in the Indianapolis Study (Whelpton and Kiser, 1958). Afterwards, a number of studies concerned with factors related to fertility included questions on expected, ideal, and desired family size (Freedman, Whelpton, and Campbell, 1959; Whelpton, Campbell and Patterson, 1966; Blake, 1966). Attitudes and desires are of prime importance in determining average family size in developed countries where family planning is widely accepted. For that reason, in fertility surveys women are often questioned not only on actual and expected but also on ideal and desired number of children. The ideals of many women are for more children than they feel they can afford. This is not surprising, because ideals in other areas of life frequently exceed reality.
Introduction of the concepts ideal and desired number of children into fertility surveys of developing countries should be rewarding. Although only a small proportion of women in childbearing ages in these countries practice birth control, it should nevertheless be useful to find out how the ideals and desires deviate from performance. There remains a problem with the concept "ideal." As defined in the CELADE fertility surveys this concept is ambiguous. The question enabling the respondent to identify the concept ideal was phrased as

follows: What do you consider a suitable number of children? One may ask for whom the number is suitable, for the women to whom the question is addressed, for the average woman, or for the total population. The concept of "ideal" number of children as defined in the Growth of American Family Studies was used in a recent study by Ryder and Westoff. (1971). They also criticized the concept as being vague. Despite the deficiencies, the concept is being used extensively in the KAP studies.
We may compare briefly the number of children considered ideal with the desired and actual number for ever-married women in Mexico City and Caracas. Table 9 shows that the average number of children considered ideal for ever-married women in Mexico City is practically constant for women up to age 39. Afterwards, the number is somewhat higher. In contrast, the average number of children considered ideal for ever-married women in Caracas is directly related to the age of woman. This may reflect a decline in the ideal number of children over the past generation. The average number of desired children differs little from the number considered ideal for women in Mexico City, whereas in Caracas the average number of desired children is slightly lower age for age than the number of children considered ideal. It could be that ever-married women in Mexico City do not distinguish between the two concepts or they want a family size that is considered "ideal." Concerning the actual number of children, it may be noticed from Table 10 that in Mexico City and in Caracas ever-married women under age 30 have fewer children than the desired number, at age 30-34 the actual and the desired number are virtually the same and for women at older ages the actual number of children surpassed the desired number.

MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS
From the analysis of factors related to fertility of ever-married women in Mexico City and in Caracas in which we dealt with only two variables at a time, we proceed now to a multivariate analysis. The method used is a linear stepwise regression technique. The independent variables are: age at first marriage, education of wife, work status of wife, occupational group of husband, desired number of children by wife. The dependent variable is the number of children ever born to women married, husband present. The partial regression coefficients along with their standard errors and the multiple regression coefficients are shown in Table 11. Since the calculations are made from sample data, there is the problem of the appropriate significance level. As an arbitrary rule, we assumed that a regression coefficient at least twice as large as its standard error is significantly different from zero.

First of all, it will be noticed that for both cities and for the ages under consideration all predictor variables except desired number of children are inversely related to fertility as indicated by the minus sign of the regression coefficient. Among the five variables, age at marriage is the only one that had a significant independent effect on fertility for the wives 20-24 years old in Mexico City and in Caracas. Although educational attainment had no independent effect, it had an indirect effect upon fertility in that women who attend school for many years postpone their marriage and this delay may lead to smaller families. For wives 25-29 years old in Mexico City, age at marriage and work status of wife had important independent consequences for the number of children she had. The partial regression coefficients indicate that a one-year delay in marriage reduced fertility more than wife's work status. For wives 25-29 years old in Caracas, each of the three factors,

Fertility in Mexico City and Caracas

age at marriage, occupation of husband, and desired number of children had a significant independent effect on fertility.
We have already explained why age at marriage had an effect on fertility. Concerning occupational status of husbands, it is plausible that men in higher nonmanual occupations may have planned and controlled their family's size in order to be socially mobile. For wives 30-34 years old in Mexico City, the only independent and significant influence on fertility was age at marriage. The partial regression coefficient for this variable indicates that a one-year delay in marriage reduced the fertility of the wife by one child on the average. In contrast, in Caracas for wives 30-34 years old, three factors, age at marriage, education, and desired number of children, had independent significant effects on fertility. A one-year delay in marriage reduced the fertility of the 30-34 years old wives by 0.8 of a child, and an increase of one year's education reduced the fertility by 0.3 of a child on the average. The desired number of children had an independent, small but statistically significant, positive effect on fertility.
For wives 35-39 years old in Mexico City, the regression equation includes only three predictor variables, age at marriage, education, and desired number of children. Two of these variables, age at marriage and desired number of children, had an independent effect on fertility. Work status of wife and occupation of husband did not enter into the regression equation, because the program terminated due to the insufficient level of the F ratio. For wives 35-39 years old in Caracas, the only independent effect on fertility was age at marriage (see Table 11). The other variables under consideration exerted only an indirect influence on fertility.
From the foregoing analysis, it is clear that the most important influence on fer-

tility was exercised by age at marriage. As suggested in a previous section, raising age at marriage through better education of women and through stimulating their interests in careers could bring a lowering of fertility. These processes are collectively needed for raising levels of living of individual families and communities as a whole.
SUMMARY AND FINDINGS
A comparative analysis of fertility behavior in relation to selected characteristics of ever-married women in Mexico City and in Caracas, and a multivariate analysis of women currently married in the two cities were presented in this paper. It was found that the cumulative fertility of ever-married women in Mexico City was higher than that of ever-married women in Caracas. In each city, age at marriage was inversely related to fertility. By age at marriage the greatest excess of fertility in Mexico City over that in Caracas was that for women who married at age below 18; the lowest excess was that for women who married at age 25 and over.
At each educational level, the fertility of ever-married women in Mexico City surpassed that of women in Caracas; the excess in fertility was the greatest at the lowest educational level and the smallest at the highest level. In Mexico City and in Caracas, employment of wives was inversely related to fertility. Again, the fertility of working wives in Mexico City was considerably higher than that of working wives in Caracas.
As with education and employment of wives, the level of husband's occupation was inversely related to fertility. Religiosity of wives controlled for education showed no consistent relationship to fertility of ever-married women in either city. The number of children considered ideal
