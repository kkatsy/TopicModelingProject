ABSTRACT: In a sample of 51 like-sex DZ twin pairs (22 male, 29 female) 49 quantitative traits were analyzed for association with, and linkage to, each of 7 informative blood systems. Nine associations were found to be significant at the 0.01 level, and a further 27 significant at the 0.05 level, whereas the numbers expected to be significant by chance alone are about 3 and 17 respectively. The most consistent associations are those of Rh with the scores obtained with Paul Griéger's characterological test. The associations may be due to a factor present in the physical or social environment that influences both characteristics simultaneously; alternative explanations are pleiotropy, epistasis, or heterogeneity of the populations. Only 12 of the tests for linkage were significant at the 0.05 level, less than would be expected by chance alone; these results are therefore inconclusive. The most significant linkage is that between Hp and activity, one of the 3 scores in Griéger's characterological test. In vew of independent data suggesting evidence of linkage between Hp and depression spectrum disease, further study of this possible linkage in larger families would be warranted.

and Kell, ABH secretion, and serum haptoglobins. All 102 individuals were typed for all eight systems. Kell was virtually uninformative for these analyses. Additional details about the data collection can be obtained in the papers mentioned at the end of the introduction.
Forty-nine quantitative traits were analyzed for association with, and linkage to, each of the seven informative blood systems. A transformation of the type y = if, where y is defined to be loga; when/; = 0, was applied to each trait to reduce the skewness of its distribution in the sample. Table 1 gives a list of the traits measured,

the value ofp used in each transformation, and the number of twin pairs measured for each trait. Table 2 gives the number of individuals in each phenotypic marker class.
Association between the phenotypes of each polymorphic marker system and each trait measure was tested by a simple oneway analysis of variance, the number of classes being equal to the number of different phenotypes for the marker system. Since the sibling relationship was ignored in this analysis, and since siblings will tend to be more similar than random members of the population for all phenotypic traits (for both genetic and environmental reasons), significant association found by this test does not necessarily imply pleiotropy. Lack of significant association on the basis of such a test, however, does imply that if the activity measure is partially determined by a locus linked to the marker locus, then there is no significant linkage disequilibrium between the two loci.

Using the method given by Haseman and Elston (1972), linkage was sought by regressing the squared twin-pair differ-

ence for a trait on the estimated proportion of genes identical by descent that the twin pair shares at a given locus. A significant negative regression, in the absence of association between the activity measure and the marker phenotypes, is indicative of linkage. Since squared differences cannot be normally distributed, and since the sample size is relatively small, the squared differences were also subjected to the transformation y = x", the value of p being chosen (in an iterative fashion) so as to make the skewness of the residuals from the regression model approximately zero. This procedure is valid (Blackwelder, unpublished) and makes Student's i-test for regression robust in this situation. Spearman's rank correlation test between the squared differences and the estimated proportion of genes identical by descent was also performed.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
ASSOCIATION
Nine prior associations between the 7 markers and the 49 traits were found to be significant at the 0.01 level (Table 3) and a further 27 significant at the 0.0S level (Table 4). The numbers expected to be significant by chance alone are about 3 and 17, respectively, if we ignore the fact that the data are in the form of sib pairs.
Details of the associations significant at the 0.01 level are given in Table 5. It is

doubtful whether the sib-pair nature of the data would cause a threefold increase in the number of expected significant associations, so at least some of these associations are probably not spurious.
The most consistent results are the associations of Rh with the scores obtained with Paul Griéger's characterological test. This and the other associations may be due to a factor present in the physical or social environment that influences both characteristics simultaneously; alternative explanations are pleiotropy, epistasis, or heterogeneity of the populations. It is difficult to envisage a factor that could simultaneously influence the Rh gene distribution and the behavioral characteristics of our subjects, since Rh incompatibility, for instance, is an event too rare to affect significantly the other trait. The hypothesis of pleiotropy or epistasis cannot be tested with our data.

As for population heterogeneity, the 49 Caucasian and 2 Negroid pairs of twins seem to be fairly representative of members of these ethnic groups living in Porto Alegre. The Blacks show signs of admixture (one pair being classified as light mulatto and the other as dark mulatto). All parents and grandparents of 10 of the 49 white pairs were of Portuguese ancestry, with no indication of admixture with persons from other nationalities. The ancestors of 19 others were also predominantly Portuguese, but at least one grandparent or more remote ancestors were from other European nationalities. The ancestry of the remaining 20 pairs can be characterized as follows: (a) at least two Italian grandparents, 8; (b) at least two German grandparents, 4; (c) Jewish, 4; (d) other nationalities, 4. Heterogeneity, therefore, is definitely present. We are not certain, however, if the genetic variation

LINKAGE
Out of 343 (7 X 49) tests, by chance alone we would expect 17 to show significance at the S per cent level. In fact,

12 regressions were found to be significantly negative at the S per cent level (one-sided f-tests), and in 13 cases Spearman's rank correlation was found to be similarly significantly negative. The 8 cases in which both tests gave a result significant at the S per cent level are shown in Table 6. Since the number of significant results is less than the one expected by chance, this listing is given solely in case any one of these should later be reported as suggestive of a linkage relationship in another study. Of these 8 cases, only one also showed significant association, that of the MNSs system and numerical ability. The most significant possible linkage found is that between Hp and activity, and it is interesting to note that data from Tanna et al. (1976) suggest linkage, using Penrose's sib-pair method, between Hp and depression spectrum disease. It would be worthwhile to test relatives of persons with this disease, as well as individuals showing the first signs of it with Griéger's questionnaire. New Hp studies in families investigated in this way would serve to further define the

relationships between this marker, the characterological traits, and the disease factors.
Results such as those obtained here should be considered only as suggestive of linkages which may be looked for in family studies applying the method of Elston and Stewart (1971). It should also be recognized that for the purpose of linkage analysis a sample size of S1 twin pairs is relatively small and would hardly be expected to lead to any definitive results.
