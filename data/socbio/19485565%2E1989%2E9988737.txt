The Norm for Perceived Husband Superiority: A Cause of Human Assortative Marriage
William H. James
Wolfson House University College, London London, England
ABSTRACT: I have suggested that human assortative marriage for a number of variables is partially caused by behavior in accordance with two norms. Epstein and Guttman (1987) have suggested that there is no empirical evidence for these norms. In this note evidence is reviewed for the norm of perceived husband-superiority. Others have shown that the evidence for this norm is strong in regard to height, and it is shown here that the evidence is strong also in regard to age. Evidence for the norm seems suggestive in regard to IQ, education, and social class, and nonexistent in regard to physical attractiveness. With respect to height, it seems that the magnitude of the correlation between spouses is associated with the size of the breeding population to which they belong. Thus, it seems likely that the hypothesized norms are learned rather than genetically coded.
It is well established that human be- have suggested that some correlations ings marry assortatively for a number of may be based on a norm for "perceived variables.

same effect. If tall men and short women are prepared to marry any partner (tall or short), but short men are prepared only to marry short women, and tall women are prepared only to marry tall men, we can foresee the probable result. Tall men, being in competition with short men in the search for short women, will be under pressure to marry tall women; and short women, being in competition with tall women in the search for tall men, will be under pressure to marry short men. Thus, a correlation between mates' stature will result. This correlation stems not from any preference of individuals for mates of their own size, but simply from a preference of both partners for a height differential favoring the man.
In response to my 1987 "Mutt-andJeff avoidance" hypothesis, Epstein and Guttman (1987) upbraided me for my "faulty logic, oversimplified and unsupported assumptions and irresponsible use of the word 'superior.' " The meaning of some of their strictures is less clear than the intention to abuse. However, the main burden of Epstein and Guttman's note, as I understand it, is that there is no empirical support for these norms. I suggest that there is an abundance of such evidence for the husbandsuperior norm. I shall treat it by some of the variables for which assortative mating is known to exist.
ASSORTATIVE MATING FOR HEIGHT
1. Epstein and Guttman (1987) review the finding of Gillis and Avis (1980) that even bearing in mind that (1) men are taller than women on the average and that (2) there is a positive correlation between the heights of husbands and wives, there is still a highly signi-

ficantdeficit of matings in which the husband is shorter than his wife. Epstein and Guttman add: "To our knowledge no study has explicitly determined whether the actual incidence of tallerman/shorter woman in mate selection differs significantly from chance". Yet the significant deficit (assessed by a Poisson probability of less than 0.00002) implies a concomitant excess (height being a continuous variable).
2. McManus and Mascie-Taylor (1984) investigated the heights of 12,994 couples ascertained by the fact that the wife bore a child in one week of 1958. These authors noted (following others) that there is assortative mating for height, the overall correlation across the sample being +0.258. However, the association is nonlinear and heteroscedastic. In particular, consider the heights of spouses of people who are at the "wrong" end of the height continua, that is, of index men less than 5'2" and of index women more than 5'11". The mean heights of the spouses of these indexes are closer to the overall means than would be estimated from the overall regression, and the variances of the heights of the spouses of these indexes are significantly greater than the adjacent variances in the distribution. These authors suggest that the bivariate distribution "probably reflects a social expectation, (the "male-taller norm," Gillis and Avis, 1980) which results in increased assortative mating as the critical point of height equality is reached, coupled with the limitations imposed by a lack of appropriate persons from whom to select as one approaches either extreme of height, which results in a lessening of assortative mating."
It seems to me that in addition to confirming my suggestion that the maletaller norm is partially responsible for

Brief Reports

assortative marriage, these authors unwittingly suggest the existence of the Mutt-and-Jeff norm. A paucity of suitable partners for very tall men or very short women implies such a norm, whereas the male-taller norm by itself would suggest a plenitude of such partners.
3. Epstein and Guttman (1987) suggest that those individuals lying at the "wrong" end of a continuum for their sex are less likely to marry, thus impugning my explanation for the positive correlations between spouses. There is something in this point. But a very large proportion of people do marry; and of those not marrying, a large number are unwavering homosexuals, institutionalized defectives, the chronic sick, the mad, the demented, and social misfits of assorted kinds. They are unmarried, that is to say, for reasons other than their height. Thus, the selection invoked by Epstein and Guttman, though it doubtless exists, cannot be very powerful and is unlikely to have any substantial effect on my proposed explanation for assortative mating.
As noted above, McManus and Mascie-Taylor (1984) attribute the large variance of heights of co-spouses of indexes of the "wrong" height to the difficulty they have in finding suitable partners. One testable probable consequence of this is that husband-shorter spouses are older at marriage than husband-taller spouses, on the average.
4. McManus and Mascie-Taylor (1984) remark of the observed bivariate distribution (of spouses' heights) that its cause is presumably not simply some form of social selection (e.g., by social class) because, if it were, one would expect a joint normal distribution, the association being linear and the variance homoscedastic. They also note that

though the husband-taller norm seems to operate, one cannot tell from the form of the distribution whether the motivation comes from women or men, or both.
However, there is other evidence on this point. If heterosexual lonelyhearts columns may be regarded as any guide, both men and women search for partners who will enable them, as a couple, to observe the norm. In such columns published in England, "petite" is a favorite adjective of male advertisers and "tall" of female ones specifying their hearts' desire. Direct data are available on the influence of height in the search for a mate. In the material of Beigel (1954), females stated a mean preference for a man taller than themselves by 6.7 inches (16.8 cms), and males expressed a mean preference for women shorter by 4.5 inches (11.3 cms). Very similar figures were reported by Gillis and Avis (1980) in an undergraduate sample.
Apparently most women do not yearn for a man shorter than themselves; and most men do not yearn for a woman taller than themselves. However, in this regard, it seems that men may be more choosy than women. The correlation between the heights of the spouses of male MZ twins is substantially higher than that between the heights of the spouses of female MZ twins (Nance et al., 1980). Moreover the variances of ages of brides marrying grooms of a given age are generally smaller than the variances of ages of grooms marrying brides of the same age (McManus and Mascie-Taylor, 1984).
In view of the highly significant deficit of husband-shorter marriages, and of the clearly stated preferences of those in the marriage market, and of the curious features of the bivariate distribution of

is on those who deny the existence of a husband-taller norm to provide explanations for these phenomena.
5. It is not suggested that the hypothesized behavioral norms are universal human characteristics. Wolanski and Siniarska (1984) reviewed spouse correlations for height from over 60 populations. They found that the magnitude of the correlations between spouses was associated with the size of the breeding population to which the spouses belonged. Very small (less than 400 individuals) isolated populations seem to yield negative correlations. These authors note that in very small populations, random mating would result in a high degree of inbreeding with consequent inbreeding depression. Hence, in such a population, there would be reproductive advantage in choosing a mate rather dissimilar to oneself (negative assortative mating). Wolanski and Siniarska (1984) also speculate that there may be some reproductive advantage (via reduced fetal and infant mor-

Bivariate distributions of ages of spouses at marriage show substantial overall positive correlations, and these distributions are (like the one discussed above) both nonlinear and heteroscedastic. To test whether there is a deficit of husband-younger marriages, I examined the bivariate distribution of ages of all brides and grooms in England and Wales, 1985 (Registrar General, 1987). The mean of the husbands' ages, ah, was 29.86 years. The mean of the wives' ages, dw, was 27.10 years. The productmoment correlation between them, rhw, was +0.846. The standard deviation of the husbands' ages, 6h, was 10.44 years. The standard deviation of the wives' ages, 6W, was 9.58 years. Consider the distribution of individual age differences (aA - aw). Though the distributions of husbands' ages and of wives' ages are both nonnormal, one would expect the distribution of their differences to approximate normality. The mean of this distribution is

The z-score estimated thus is 0.49; and the area under the curve outside this value is about 0.31.The total number of marriages was 346,389. So the expected number in which the husband is younger is 0.31 x 346,389 = 107,380. Consider those cells in which the husbands' and wives' ages are reportedly the same (to within one year until age 24, and within 5 years thereafter). Let us assume that there are equal numbers of husbandyounger and husband-older couples in each such cell. Then the observed number of husband-younger couples was 95,082. In other words, the observed husband-younger deficit (which numerically equals the husband-older excess) is of the order of 11 per cent and the corresponding chi-squared values (for the excess and for the deficit) both far exceed tabled values.
One may conclude that this excess of husband-older marriages is not explained by the following facts:

ASSORTATIVE MATING BY SOCIAL CLASS
This paper attempts to identify some behavioral norms of which assortative mating is a secondary effect. There is certainly assortative mating for social class, but I know no data which would enable one to determine whether this may be partially a consequence of a norm for husband-superiority. However, that such a norm exists is exemplified by the data of Townsend (1987). He studied 40 unmarried medical students, 20 male and 20 female. As they moved through medical school, they experienced a rise in socieconomic status (SES). Townsend wrote of his findings: "Increasing SES tends to enlarge the pool of acceptable available sexual and marital partners for men while it tends to reduce the pool for women". It is difficult to see why this should be true unless there is a norm for husbandsuperiority in regard to SES.
COMMENT

are unrealistic. The reproductive strategies of the two sexes differ. Some of these differences seem consistent with sociobiological expectation. For instance, one may note the apparent male choosiness with respect to obvious physical characteristics such as age, height, and beauty. However, this note has not addressed the problem of whether women actually are more interested in those more subtle traits which presumably characterize reliable protectors of, and providers for, potential offspring.
Attention here has so far been confined to the causes of assortative mating. One might note a possible consequence of it. The variances of ages of co-spouses to indexes of a given age at marriage seem substantially to exceed the variances atfirstbirth (James, 1974). The natural inference is that the fertility of spouses of the more extreme age combinations (in both directions) is lower than that of spouses in the modal age combinations. It would be interesting to know the causes. One cause may be diminished coital rates (James, 1983ft). It would also be interesting to know whether experimental animals show age-related preferences in regard to the age of mating partners; and if so, whether this trait has a genetic basis.

Genetic models of assortation have generally assumed mechanisms which are "symmetric," in that males and females seek the same traits in spouses. In regard to some variables, these models
