ABSTRACT: Differences among census tracts in academic performance are estimated and related by path analysis to social class, race, and school characteristics in the only American state without local autonomous school districts. Contrary to the Coleman Report, school has a significant effect and race does not, but social class is the major cause of census tract difference in academic performance. Without appropriate data on family resemblance, a genetic component in class structure cannot be delineated.

Most studies of school performance are motivated to detect reparable weaknesses in the educational system or to elucidate familial effects (environmental and genetic) which condition the success of educational policy (Jencks, 1972). Another interest in school performance is as an indicator of neighborhood characteristics which influence health and welfare. Here we address the determination of academic performance among census tracts by social class, race, and school characteristics. This study leads to certain conclusions about the causes of these differences and to estimates of census tract indices which we believe will be useful for studies in epidemiology and the social sciences.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data consist of two files on elementary school attendance areas and census tracts, respectively, together with a table giving correspondences between the two data sets so that school characteristics can be distributed by census tract and vice versa. The school file gives mean converted scores for aptitude and achievement tests and information about students, teachers,

and school administration during 1970-72 (published and unpublished reports of the State of Hawaii Department of Education). The census tract file contains means for variables from the 1970 census (U.S. Department of Commerce publication PHC(l)-88 and unpublished racial frequencies tabulated for the Office of Human Resources of the City and County of Honolulu). The table of correspondences provided by the State Department of Education gives for each census tract the number of enumeration districts (estimated by inhabited area to two decimal places) which were included in a given elementary school attendance area in 1971-72. These data are described more fully below.
Test means from the school file were reduced to a correlation matrix which was submitted to two principal component analyses to determine the first eigenvector of the original matrix, which defines general performance, and the first eigenvector of the centroid-adjusted matrix, which defines specific performance by maximizing divergence among tests. The latter is virtually identical to the second eigenvector of the matrix before centroid adjustment

(Lalouel, 1973). The scores defined by these vectors were regressed on school characteristics to give indices of academic performance (Morton, 1974). Finally, scores and student variables were converted to census tract estimates, weighting by the number of enumeration districts included in that school attendance area from the given census tract. Regression on class and racial variables gave indices for path analysis of variation in school performance among census tracts (Rao et al., ms.). By these procedures, the main technical difficulty of the material, that some variables are known only for school districts and others only for census tracts, is effectively overcome.
RESULTS
THE SCHOOL FILE
All public elementary schools in Hawaii administered School and College Ability Tests (SCAT) to grades 4 and 6, Sequential Tests of Educational Progress (STEP) to grades 4, 5, and 6, and the California Achievement Test (CAT) and California Test of Mental Maturity (CTMM) to second graders. Mean scores for grades within school were computed by the Department of Education and made available to us. There were 153 schools with information on all 17 tests. The correlation matrix has only positive elements, and the first eigenvector gives nearly equal weight to each test. As in other studies, there is no discrimination between ostensible measures of ability and achievement. After centroid adjustment, the first eigenvector is proportional to grade, reflecting rate of change of performance with age in different schools.
We shall call these vectors and the scores which they specify performance (P) and grade (G), respectively (Table 1). Relative performance increases with age in schools with high values of G and de-

creases with age in less favored schools. For each vector v, the corresponding score for the ;th school is

17
= V* vixi¡/ai

(1)

where xt¡ is the mean for the ith test in the /th school and <T{ is the standard deviation of the /th test among schools.
These scores were now regressed stepwise on twelve school characteristics (Table 2). Performance was not significantly associated with small classes, high expenditure, or advanced teacher training, but was significantly associated with high teacher salaries and experience and low cost per student. This pattern may reflect attraction of experienced teachers from small rural to large suburban schools, but any interpretation must remain in doubt until socioeconomic variables are allowed for.
RACE
The 1970 census pooled part-Hawaiians with Hawaiians, Puerto Ricans with Caucasians, and Samoans with "others." Mixtures were classified by paternal race. The random sample of the Hawaii Health Survey, which considers both parents for mixtures, gives correspondingly higher proportions of part-Hawaiians and "others." We are here concerned not with the genetic composition of the population, but with the association of ethnic group and performance. For this purpose, the imperfections of census data are annoying but not critical.
When performance is estimated for each census tract by the method of the first section and these estimates are regressed stepwise on ethnic proportions, weighting census tracts equally, means for each race are obtained. Filipinos and Hawaiians score low, while Orientals and Caucasians are high. Caucasians and Japanese maintain their high level from grades 2 to 6, but

obtained. Although still significantly higher than the rest of the population, Japanese are closer to the mean after covariance adjustment. Similarly, the performance of Hawaiians and Filipinos improves. When both class and school indices are used, the racial differences become still smaller, and the Japanese no longer significantly excel the others. Racial differences in grade score are entirely removed by covariance adjustment.
Mayeske et al. (1973, p. 8) observed the same tendency for racial differences on the U.S. mainland to be reduced as more aspects of the background were taken into account, with no substantial change in rank

order, and concluded: "Hence, we have accounted for almost all of the differences among students in Achievement that are associated with their racial-ethnic group membership by considerations that are primarily social in nature and origin." Similarly, Nichols and Anderson (1973) found that most of the IQ difference between mainland Blacks and whites disappeared within neighborhoods, and Rao et al. (ms.) concluded from path analysis of the Coleman Report that at least 80 per cent of the racial difference was due to covariance between race and cultural factors. We would expect cultural factors to be at least as important in Hawaii, because of the short exposure of the low-performing groups to the American milieu.
When census tract estimates of performance are regressed on the class, racial, and school indices, all three partial regression coefficients are highly significant. Thus, school characteristics contribute to prediction of academic performance after allowance for class and race, but one cannot say from this analysis whether the significant partial regression is due to covariance between schools and imperfectly estimated class indices or to an independent effect of schools.
The same method which distributed school performance among census tracts gives class and racial indices for schools. When performance is regressed on school variables and the two indices, estimates of the effects of school characteristics adjusted for covariance with the student body are obtained. Performance is associated with high teacher experience (/ = 3.31), low expenditure per student (t = --5.16), and small classes (t = --2.26). No other variable has a significant partial regression. This is a much simpler pattern than was obtained in Table 2 without covariance adjustment for student body variables. It suggests that performance is optimized by

small classes, experienced teachers, and large schools. However, the possibility that these associations are due to inadequate covariance control over student body variables cannot be excluded, since teacher and school characteristics have not been (and in part cannot be) randomized among neighborhoods.
Grade score is negatively associated with new teachers (t = --4.21) and high experience (t = --2.79). This finding suggests that in schools where performance declines with grade, teachers familiar with the school but without long teaching experience may optimize performance. If so, both inexperienced and highly experienced teachers should be placed preferentially in the better schools, with rotation of moderately experienced teachers through the lower achieving schools. However, the usual caution about covariance analysis applies, and this suggestion is at most a hypothesis to be tested.
CENSUS TRACT SCORES
Performance is subject to errors of estimation due to small samples and conversion from school attendance areas to census tracts. It therefore seems useful to combine these direct estimates with the three indicators. Equation (1) gives the score
y = 0.1535 P + 0.2097 S
+ 0.1759 C + 0.1856 R,
where P is performance and 5, C, and R are indices from school, class, and race, respectively. If \i and a are respectively the mean and standard deviation of y among census tracts with known P, S, C, and R, a convenient index is y' = 5 + (y -- n ) / c , which has a mean of 5, unit variance, a range from 2 to 8, and approximates the probit of predicted school performance. Values of y' have been filed with the National Auxiliary Publication (NAPS)

PATH ANALYSIS
Covariance analysis, although useful to predict performance, does not allow for estimation errors in the independent variables and therefore gives no rigorous evidence on causation. Path analysis, however, allows us to test causal hypotheses (Rao et al., ms.). We are especially interested in the hypothesis that race and school characteristics are related to performance only through their covariance with class and are therefore not causal. The alternative hypothesis is that race and school characteristics are not coUinear with class but exert an independent effect on performance. Such an effect of school variables must be environmental, but a racial effect could in principle be genetic. Without critical data on family resemblance, there can be no distinction between genetic and environ-

mental effects. The logical error that noncollinearity of race and class implies a genetic effect of race has plagued behavior genetics. Here we use a different and valid principle, that rejection of the null hypothesis of collinearity is a necessary but not sufficient condition for asserting a genetic component in racial effects.
Correlations between indices and effects are given in Table 4. No model without school as a cause was acceptable (P < 0.0S), in contrast to the Coleman Report on U.S. schools where effects of statewide educational systems were swamped by local

racial effect on performance is not excluded (Model 3). Assumptions about the precision of indices have appreciable effects on tests of goodness of fit and estimates of relative direct effects. However, extensive trials of alternative models did not improve the fit or substantially alter the conclusions of Figure 2. The relative direct effects of school and race are about 0.3, indicating that two random schools or races differing by 1S points in performance would differ by only 4-5 points if the other causes were randomized. The relative di-

rect effect of social class is at least twice as great, in agreement with the Coleman Report.
DISCUSSION
The primary objective of this study was to estimate census tract scores for academic performance to be used as social indicators. \ second objective was to infer the causes of differences in performance among census tracts. Path analysis suggests social class as the main determinant, but a significant effect of school characteristics. Unlike the national survey in the Coleman Report, neighborhood socioeconomic differences do not swamp regional efforts to provide equal educational opportunity in the only American state which has no autonomous local school districts. Elsewhere, school districts depend largely on their members for direction and tax support, with consequences that are highly predictable from sociocultural indices.
Despite the considerable cultural and linguistic differences among ethnic groups in Hawaii, race exerts all or most of its effect on academic performance through covariance with class and school characteristics. It is therefore unlikely that racial differences in Hawaii are to any appreciable extent genetic, but a rigorous test would require a study of resemblance of half-sibs or foster sibs in racially mixed families. Of more practical interest is the suggestion from covariance analysis that high teacher experience, large schools, and small classes enhance general academic performance, while teachers familiar with the school but without long teaching expeience may have the best effect in schools where performance declines with grade.
On the U.S. mainland there is a significant covariance between midparent genotype and family environment, accounting for 12 per cent of the IQ variation of children (Rao et al., 1974). We might conjee-
