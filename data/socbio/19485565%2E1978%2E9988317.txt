The Biocultural Pattern of Japanese-American Fertility

ABSTRACT: A comparison of age-specific fertility data on second-generation Japanese-American women with published data on modern and premodern women in Japan and with data on modern U.S. white women shows the persistence of a fertility pattern among all Japanese groups. This pattern is significantly different from that of U.S. whites. It appears that continuity in certain family and kinship elements has played a central role in the persistence of this pattern. In addition, it is suggested that the introduction of modern contraceptive techniques may have the consequence of merely intensifying a cultural pattern of fertility, rather than changing its basic outlines.

fertility about equally divided between these two age groups.
Given both the biological constraints on fertility and this simple three-way classification system, the differences one may describe between age patterns of fertility are limited. Obviously, similar sets of sociocultural influences would be expected to produce similar patterns. It would seem possible that differing sets of sociocultural influences could also produce similar patterns. Indeed, while the U.N. researchers found a similarity between fertility patterns within geographical/cultural regions, they discovered that geographically-separated and different cultures also could produce similar patterns.
Although these findings make it impossible to point out a direct correlation between a culture and a specific fertility pattern, they still suggest the variable influences of different sets of sociocultural factors on fertility. These influences are interestingly apparent in the U.N. finding that no correlation exists between the type of peak and the degree of economic development or level of fertility among the 72 nations. Economically developed lowfertility countries fall into all three "peak" categories. Since it may be assumed that modern contraceptive practices are responsible for the low fertility, it is apparent that these practices have not yet brought about a single modern pattern of age-specific fertility.
Historical comparisons of modern with premodern fertility have sometimes indicated more continuity and stability in fertility variables than might have been predicted, given the dramatic vital revolution described by the demographic transition model (Blacker, 1947; Davis, 1963; Freedman, 196S; Notestein, 1952). For example, Hajnal (196S) reports that a late age at marriage has characterized Western Europe for the last two hundred years; Pakrasi and Malakar (1973) document the

persistence of a traditional family building pattern (specifically, short marriage-tofirst-birth intervals) among high-status well-educated couples in Calcutta in the early 197O's. The persistence of such fertility pattern elements in the face of economic development and reduction in fertility levels would seem to reflect continuity in the play of particular sociocultural forces on the childbearing processes.
In the case of Japan, Hanley (1972, 1974) argues that fertility in Japan has not changed substantially since the premodern period of the 1700's and 1800's1 (the late Tokugawa and early Meiji periods). Hanley has used records2 from four Japanese villages which, combined, span the period 1683 to 1871 to reconstruct elements of the premodern fertility pattern. The modal age group for childbearing was 25 to 29 years, resulting in a "late-peak" age pattern of fertility. A high average age at marriage, consistently exceeding age 22 over all historical periods and for all villages, was the apparent determinant of this late-peak pattern. Furthermore, the average age at last birth was about 36 years. A short childbearing span resulted, and the mean completed family size was small, averaging three to four children.
Late average age at marriage along with divorce and widowhood acted to restrict mean completed family size in premodern Japan. Beyond these effects there is also evidence for some control of family size
1 There is some discrepancy between the official statistics which indicate a rise in birth rates in association with a constant death rate (Taeuber, 1958) and the revisions made by Morita (1963) indicating a constant birth rate in association with a declining death rate. In either case, it is agreed that no dramatic changes have taken place in Japan's demographic patterns during its transition into a modern industrialized state. Certainly, population growth rates were relatively low in early Japan compared to those found in many underdeveloped countries today.
2 These records are in the form of religious investigation records (shuman-aratame-cho) begun in the seventeenth century and designed to control the spread of Christianity in Japan.

females (1972, p. S28-S30). Further evidence for these practices from rural population records includes the existence of a long period (eight or nine years) between the birth of the last child (at about age 36) and the end of the childbearing period (about age 45) for those women married throughout these years.
A "late-peak" fertility pattern, resulting at least in part from identifiable sociocultural practices, was thus established in premodern Japan. This "late-peak" pattern persists in modern Japan and, as this paper will show, among secondgeneration Japanese-American women.

her spouse's sisters. Complete reproductive histories (including only live births) were collected on a total sample of 166 women. The reproductive years of these women span a long time period, from 192S to 1975. However, their fertility is mostly concentrated in the years from 1935 to 1965.
The fertility data on U.S. white women are for 1950 and 1960 and are taken from national vital statistical records (National Center for Health Statistics, 1977, Table 1-6). The 1950 rates for women in modern Japan come from Taeuber (1958, p. 236), and the 1960 rates come from the United Nations study discussed above (United Nations, 1965, p. 103). Hanky's (1974, p. 135) data were used to calculate premodern age-specific fertility rates. The number of births to women in each fiveyear age period between 15 and 49 years for four villages during various time periods in the 1600's, 1700's, and 1800's provide the relative incidence of births during each age period. The average completed family size for this premodern period has been estimated by Hanley (1974) and Hayami (1968, cited in Hanley, 1974) to have been approximately 3.5 children. If this number (3.5) is used as an estimate of the total fertility rate (TFR),4 estimated age-specific fertility rates can be derived by multiplying the percentage of all births in each age period by 3.5 and then dividing by five to determine a yearly average ASFR for each five-year period.
The sets of data are not strictly comparable. The figures for Japanese-American fertility are based on actual cohort data. Each age-specific fertility rate given is the mean rate for the five five-year secondgeneration cohorts born between 1910 and
4 The total fertility rate (TFR) is the sum of the age-specific fertility rates (multiplied by five for the fiveyears represented by each rate). It calculates the total births per woman which would result if a cohort of women were to follow a schedule of births represented by the age-specific birth rates.

1934. The same women are therefore represented in each rate. The rates given for the U.S. white and modern Japanese women assume a hypothetical cohort (i.e., one year's fertility performance by women of all ages is treated as though experienced by one group of women over their entire reproductive lifetime). Thus, each rate given actually represents the fertility experience of a different group of women. To compensate for this problem, two sets of data from 1950 and 1960 are given for both the United States and modern Japan in order to characterize better the range in fertility rates which is not represented in the fertility experience of one year. Finally, the rates for women in premodern Japan are estimated from the fertility experience of a number of different women living at different times.
RESULTS
The Japanese-American age-specific fertility rates reveal a pattern which may be described as belonging to the "latepeak" fertility pattern (Figure 1) with the greatest concentration of births in the age period 25-29 years. Fertility in the following age period (30-34 years) is higher than that in the younger age period (20-24 years) preceding the "peak" age period. Fertility in the age group 15-19 years is extremely low. A late start in childbearing is coupled with curtailment of births after age 35, producing a concentrated pattern of reproduction between the ages of 20 to 34 years. The average second-generation pattern just described is also consistently apparent in the fertility of each of its constituent five main birth cohorts (Figure 2). Each displays a low rate in the 15-19 age period and a late peak. Differences among these curves may be explained by the differing historical circumstances experienced by the cohorts (Leonetti, 1976).

The relationship between the Japanese curves is even more clearly shown in Figure S where the per cent distribution of total fertility attributed to each ageperiod is plotted. Again, the relative lack of concentration of births in the peak age period in premodern Japan is evident. Fertility

change from the premodern to the 1950 curve to the 1960 curve involves an increasing concentration of births in the peak fertility period (ages 25-29 years). A progressive decline in reproduction after age 35 years also occurs from premodern to modern times. Modern Japan as of 1960 is remarkable among all nations in the extraordinary concentration of fertility in the age period 25-29 and the very low level of fertility in the 15-19 age period (United Nations, 1965). The JapaneseAmerican per cent distribution curve is intermediate between the 1950 and 1960 Japanese curves5 in its concentration of births. In this figure, continuity of what may be called the "Japanese" fertility pattern from premodern to modern Japanese and Japanese-American women is evident.
DISCUSSION
From these results, second-generation Japanese-American fertility appears to belong within a manifestation of cultural succession. The fertility pattern of these women has been shown to have distinctive characteristics which differentiate it from that of contemporary U.S. white women. On the other hand, striking similarities exist between the fertility patterns of second-generation Japanese-American women and those of modern Japanese women. Furthermore, these modern Japanese patterns appear to have developed directly out of the fertility patterns of premodern Japan. The increasing concentration of reproduction at the peak period accompanied by its reduction after age 35 appears as a secular trend of fertility change which occurs within a basic pattern continuity.
5 The high percentage of births in the JapaneseAmerican pattern at ages 30-34 years may have resulted from historical factors (including the World War II relocation of West Coast Japanese-Americans) which brought about delays of births in some second-generation cohorts (Leonetti, 1976).

The progression from a broad distribution of births in premodern Japan to a narrow distribution in modern Japan is due to increasing control over reproduction through modern techniques of contraception and abortion (Miyamoto, 1973; Muramatsu, 1960). The use of modern contraceptives is, of course, a cultural practice and is a modern addition to other more traditional cultural practices modifying directly and indirectly the level and pattern of fertility in a population.
It is suggested here that contraceptive practices have been used to bring under further control a society's fertility while at the same time preserving its essential pattern characteristics. Furthermore, it is assumed here that these techniques would be used in a conscious effort to follow a culturally acceptable family-building model. The cultural processes from which this model is derived, however, may remain traditional and, of course, exceedingly complex in nature.
In the case of both Japanese and Japanese-American women, modern alterations in their fertility patterns primarily involve the retention or intensification of characteristics established in the premodern period. The modal age period of 25-29 years remains, but the concentration of births in this peak fertility period has been accentuated in the modern patterns. Fertility in the 15-19 age period was low in premodern times and has been further reduced in recent years. These observations of historical modifications of the "Japanese" biocultural pattern of fertility point to the importance of understanding contraceptive use within the context of the traditional fertility pattern.
The age-specific fertility patterns of other present-day low-fertility countries may also be viewed as traditional patterns brought under control by contraceptive practices. In the United Nations (1965) study, patterns of low-fertility countries

48

are shown to fall into all three "peak" categories. The process of effective fertility reduction through the use of modern contraceptives thus does not appear to destroy what may be interpreted as their basic traditional fertility patterns.6 The lowfertility countries, however, display less fertility pattern variability among the fertility patterns in each "peak" category than do the high-fertility countries. The great variability among the patterns of the high-fertility countries within each category may result from a larger variety of combinations of cultural influences impinging on their fertility curves. Conversely, less variability among the lowfertility patterns may result from the common contraceptive practices used in these nations. While contraceptive practices may be used to carry on traditional patterns, they also appear to create more similarity among countries with already similar patterns.
The similarity between all the "Japanese" fertility patterns suggests continuity in the sociocultural context of that fertility. Furthermore, the cultural continuity reflected in Japanese-American second-generation fertility calls for an exploration of the processes involved in the transplantation and preservation of their cultural heritage by a migrant population. One approach would be to view sociocultural characteristics as an essential part of a population's adaptive strategy within its environment. The preservation of traditional social (kinship) and economic patterns which took place in the migration period could be understood in terms of the adaptive continuity of the sociocultural context of the fertility patterns.
For example, it has been argued by Yanagisako (1975a, b) that the widespread

entry of Japanese immigrants into family-based business enterprises in the prewar period allowed the transfer to America of many traditional Japanese economic and social patterns which had been developed in the context of family farming enterprises in Japan. Consequently, the economic and psychological influences on age at marriage of secondgeneration Japanese-American women have continued to be similar to those in Japan. Both groups of women have a late median age at marriage (over age 23; Bogue, 1969; Leonetti, 1976) as did premodern Japanese women (over age 22; Hanley, 1974). In turn, late age at marriage has been one major determinant of the characteristic and persistent biocultural pattern of fertility found among premodern Japanese, modern Japanese, and second-generation Japanese-American women. The similar situation of the daughters in families both in Japan and in prewar America as contributors to the economic welfare of the family unit may have worked to delay marriages until ages 22-24 years. A young woman in rural agricultural Japan or a second-generation Japanese-American woman rarely left her parents' home to live elsewhere before marriage, remaining a contributor to this economic unit until she married. The psychological dimension of the resulting intergenerational dependency (noted by Doi, 1973) may also have been important in delaying age at marriage.
From the work done by Yanagisako (1975a, b), it seems clear that in the case of the Japanese-Americans many traditional family-centered behavior patterns persist and kin roles and sex roles are wellpreserved, although modified where necessary to fit new situations. Elements of the roles which were in conflict with the demands of American life have been sacrificed and the remaining elements reorganized and perpetuated. The implica-

tions of this apparent sociocultural continuity on the maintenance of fertility patterns discussed here is undoubtedly great and deserves further exploration.
It may be argued that the differences observed between Japanese-American and U.S. white fertility patterns would disappear if socioeconomic factors were controlled for in the analysis. Since a major determinant of age patterns of fertility is age at marriage, comparisons center around this variable. Mean age at marriage for the Japanese-American women in the present sample is 24.1 years (Leonetti, 1976), while mean age at marriage for the same birth cohorts (1910 to 1934) of U.S. white females is 21.9 years (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1972).7 Socioeconomic controls might be first applied by comparing Japanese-American women with white American women in similar socioeconomic circumstances for age at marriage. The relatively low (although improving) socioeconomic status of second-generation Japanese-Americans during the 1940's and 1950's (Varon, 1967) would require that they be matched with a lower-thanaverage socioeconomic group of white Americans. Lower socioeconomic status among white Americans has been associated with a decrease in age at marriage (U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, 1965). An even earlier age pattern of childbearing than that found among all white American women would therefore be expected in the lower-than-average socioeconomic subgroup. Given such a comparison, the pattern differences would still be apparent and would probably increase.
However, the low general socioeconomic position of Japanese-Americans during the 1940's and 195O's is inconsistent with their considerable educational at-

tainment. In Washington State, median school years completed by JapaneseAmerican females 25 years and over in 1940, 1950, and 1960 were 8.9, 12.2, and 12.3, respectively. The figures for white females 25 years and over were 10.1, 11.9, and 12.1 for the same years (Schmid and Nobbe, 1965). For the present sample (which excludes older women, firstgeneration immigrants), the median school years completed were 13.0 (Leonetti, 1976). Since age at marriage is related to school years completed (Tietze and Lauriat, 1955), it might be hypothesized that the late age at marriage found among Japanese-American women may be attributable to their educational experience.
This question may be addressed by calculating an "expected" age at marriage for the Japanese-American women assuming they experienced the same mean age at marriage by educational level found among U.S. white females in 1950. The year 1950 is chosen because it was central in the time span of second-generation Japanese-American marriage activity. This procedure gives an "expected" mean age at marriage of 22.1 years for the entire sample, a full two years below the observed figure of 24.1 years. Therefore, the comparatively late age at marriage found among second-generation women cannot be attributed to differences in education between the two groups. Rather, the factors responsible for this late age at marriage are to be found within the sociocultural matrix of Japanese-American life.
Finally, the observations presented in this paper are relevant when interpretations of fertility levels are made. Japanese-American fertility rates have for some time been at low levels similar to those of U.S. white women (Goldscheider and Uhlenberg, 1969; Thomas, 1950). The Japanese-American average total fertility rate (TFR) is estimated to be approximately 2.5 compared with 2.2, 3.0, 3.5
