It is well established that rates of reproductive wastage increase with birth order and with maternal age. However, in regard to spontaneous abortion, the extent of these increases is not clear, prospective material showing far smaller increases than retrospective data (Taylor, 1970). The cause of these increases is not clear either. Logically, they could be due to either (1) a genuine effect, that is, a process in which the degree of risk in each individual woman mimics the overall rates, changing as she makes the transition from one birth order-maternal age category to the next (the genuine-effect hypothesis), or (2) an artifact introduced by the hypothesized higher fertility of wastage-prone women (the artifact hypothesis), or both.
There is little doubt that there is some truth in the first of these hypotheses, but it

is important to decide whether there is any in the second, because its falsity has been presupposed in discussion on (a) the biological parameters underlying demographic change, and (6) the consequences of confining reproduction within certain age and parity categories. For instance, in regard to (a), Sheps (1965) and Henry (1965) ignore the possibility of the artifact hypothesis; yet, if it were true, it would cast some doubt on their inferences on the duration of postpartum sterility and the variability of fecundability. As for (b), if the artifact hypothesis were true, one would entertain doubts about the conclusions of Nortman (1974) in regard to the expected decline in rates of reproductive casualty if childbearing were kept within certain age and parity categories.
After analyzing individual obstetric histories, I have suggested that there is strong

evidence for the artifact hypothesis in regard to spontaneous abortion (James 1963, 1974), stillbirth (James, 1968), and neonatal death (James, 1970). I have not suggested that the genuine-effect hypothesis is false, but rather that the artifact hypothesis is true, and that an artifact is primarily responsible for the overall rises in rates with age and parity.
The reason for raising the matter again is that Naylor {SocialBiology, 1974, Vol. 21, pp. 195-204) has reported on a study in which he explicitly looked for and failed to find, evidence for the artifact hypothesis. Accordingly, I should like first to offer further grounds for supposing that there is truth in the hypothesis and, second, to make some comments on Naylor's study.
If the hypothesis were true, then the rises in wastage rates with maternal age and birth order would be expected to be less steep in those societies in which no efficient methods of birth limitation were used. Such a phenomenon has been reported in data from the Hutterites (Sheps, 1965) and the Amish (Resseguie, 1974).
Resseguie also persuasively suggested (1973a,b) that if the artifact hypothesis were correct, it might be because those women who have least control over their reproduction have high wastage rates (both features being due perhaps to lower-class socioeconomic status). On the basis of this suggestion, he predicted a negative relationship between relative age-specific live-birth rates and relative stillbirth rates within countries. He was suggesting that, because of the different proportions of stillbirth-prone women in the various categories, stillbirth rates in age-and-parity categories go down when it becomes fashionable to have children in them and that they go up when it becomes unfashionable. He found the predicted relationship in data from the United States, Japan, and France.

Naylor (1974) presented data on obstetric histories from a randomly selected sample of women ascertained at a number of United States hospitals. Naylor interpreted these histories as giving evidence against the artifact hypothesis in regard to spontaneous abortion. It seems worth making some comments on his study.
His subjects were routinely interviewed in a hospital atmosphere before the liberalization of the law on induced abortion in the United States. It seems fair to infer that induced abortion was not mentioned in his interviews. So it is not clear which of his abortions were induced and which were spontaneous. In 1970 a WHO committee suggested that in developed countries the incidence of induced abortion among first (presumably marital) pregnancies is low, while in subsequent pregnancies the rate increased. This suggestion also seems to be true of legally induced abortions today. Moreover, it seems also to have been true at a time when most induced abortions were illegal (Bateman, 1968; Stix and Wiehl, 1930; Tietze, 1949). Accordingly, it seems reasonable to wonder whether the effect reported by Naylor is due, at least partially, to the presence in his data of unacknowledged induced abortions.
It is clear that if because, say, of memory deficits women underreport spontaneous abortions experienced in the distant past to a greater extent than those experienced in the recent past, then the data will yield evidence for spurious maternal age and birth order effects. Naylor presents data which he claims vindicate his trust of his subjects' memories. However, his claim, it seems to me, is based on a theory of memory for which he adduces no evidence. He writes (p. 198): "If memory bias produced the apparent effect, then displacement of a single recalled abortion toward higher parity

should increase with length of history." I cannot see why one should make this assumption. In lieu of data on this point, one may feel free to examine other data on the memory of women about their spontaneous abortions.
There is very good evidence that spontaneous abortion rates collected retrospectively are much lower than those collected prospectively (Yerushalmy et al., 19S6; Potter et al., 196S; Freedman et al., 1966; Coombs et al., 1969). Moreover, those rates collected from old women are much lower than those collected from young women (Yerushalmy et al., 19S6), although stillbirth rates collected from old and from young women are both reasonably in accord with official vital statistics (Yerushalmy et al., 1956). Jain (1969) has presented data on reported spontaneous abortion rates simultaneously by age at pregnancy and age at interview. For the same age at pregnancy, the reported rate declines as the age at interview increases. By far the most plausible explanation (though the immediate cause is immaterial to my argument) of these apparent reporting disparities is that of defective memory.
The artifact hypothesis claims that abortion-prone women have more pregnancies than others and that this (partially) explains the fact that higher order pregnancies are more likely to abort than earlier ones. Naylor writes that if the artifact hypothesis were correct, then women with one or more spontaneous abortions should, for constant gravidity, be older than women with no spontaneous abortions. In his data, the white women registering two live births are, on the average, older than women registering two spontaneous abortions. Naylor accordingly rejects the artifact hypothesis. It seems to me that his reasoning is invalid. Since the hypothesis assumes that

abortion-prone women breed faster (whether to compensate or otherwise), one would expect them to be registering their third pregnancies earlier than abortionresistant women. And the fact that white, but not Black, women do so, suggests to me that contraceptive measures are used to effect this. At any rate, contrary to Naylor, I would interpret his data to support the artifact hypothesis on this point.
Lastly, there is a point which stems from the fact that Naylor's obstetric histories are incomplete. A woman at a given birth rank is more likely to have another pregnancy if her last pregnancy spontaneously aborted than if it were liveborn (James, 1963; Warburton and Fraser, 1964; Billewicz, 1973). If obstetric histories are complete, this phenomenon may lead to a spurious suggestion of a negative birth order effect (James, 1969). However, where women are ascertained by a pregnancy (the result of which is not recorded), a disproportionate number of last pregnancies will have spontaneously aborted. In other words, Naylor's method of ascertainment will, unless corrected for, yield a spurious suggestion of a positive birth order effect for spontaneous abortion.
It is perhaps unlikely that this problem will be settled without prospective data on complete obstetric histories. The only such data known to me--though admittedly limited--seem to give more support to the artifact than to the genuine-effect hypothesis (Reed and Kelly, 1958; James, 1963).
The present note suggests that Naylor may have failed to take sufficient notice of the possibilities (1) that his data are biased by the inclusion of unacknowledged induced abortions and by memory deficit of the respondents, and (2) that reproductive compensation after a spontaneous abortion may necessitate adjustments to his calculations.

Comment on Inhaber'« "The Brain Drain from India"
G. R. Saini

Research Branch Agriculture Canada Fredericton, New Brunswick Canada
The issue raised by Inhaber (5ocialBiology, 1975, Vol. 22, No. 3) is ofgreat interest to the international community, and it is very desirable that whatever is published and used to shape policies be valid and properly interpreted.

The use of statistical analysis will not remove the built-in bias of a scientist if he/she uses a faulty experimental design. The conclusion drawn by Inhaber is, in this context, a contortionist's masterpiece of twisting and warping. As it would be
