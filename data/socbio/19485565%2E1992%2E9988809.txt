ABSTRACT: The achievement or reproductive intentions of Sri Lankan women was examined by using longitudinal data for the period 1982-85. Aggregate consistency between reproductive intentions and behavior was almost perfect, but at the individual level there were inconsistencies. Among those who wanted to have no more children, 23 per cent reported a birth in the intersurvey period of 3 years and 2 months, while failures to have a wanted birth stood at 36 per cent. There was a clear declining trend in the former type of inconsistencies in Sri Lanka, but the latter type has increased, possibly due to a continuing decline in family size ideals or due to deferred childbearing. Even though inconsistencies existed, expressed fertility intentions in 1982 significantly influenced the fertility outcome. The study also has a methodological focus on whether to include sterilized women when fertility intentions and behavior are examined longitudinally, but no specific problems were found with their inclusion. Results indicate that, apart from the intention variable, age, marital duration, family size, and education of husband and wife variables all influenced fertility in the follow-up period.

Evidence about the relationship between fertility intentions and behavior is more scarce than that about the relationship of attitudinal and normative factors to intentions, mainly because the former requires a longitudinal research design, which is more costly in both time and resources. However, the predictive validity of reproductive intentions has been the subject of an increasing number of studies throughout the world in the recent past, since rationalization in reproductive reports is a major problem when this area is approached with cross-sectional data. The importance of longitudinal studies is that they shed light on the degree to which people plan their reproduction and successfully implement those plans

which is of considerable policy relevance.
Even though in most studies in the developed countries women's reproductive intentions tended to exceed the number of children actually born (Westoff and Ryder, 1977), many of the longitudinal studies which link reproductive intentions to subsequent fertility have shown that individual intentions are often sufficiently stable to have a large effect on subsequent fertility (Freedman et al., 1965; Hermalin et al., 1979; Foreit and Suh, 1980; Nair and Chow, 1980; Stycos, 1984; Van de Giessen, 1988; Vlassoff, 1990; Thomson et al., 1990). Such consistency has mostly been observed in societies where contraception is widely prac-

ticed. However, due to the way intentions were measured and the fact that intentions can be continuously reassessed, some disagreement should be expected (Morgan, 1985).
In Sri Lanka, as in much of the developing world, fertility has been falling rapidly with rapid adoption of contraception. The total fertility rate dropped from 5.0 in 1963 to 3.5 in 1981, and the estimate of 2.8 for the period 1982-87 found by the Sri Lanka Demographic and Health Survey (SLDHS) witness its continuing decline (Department of Census and Statistics, 1988). But evidence is rather limited in Sri Lanka concerning the relationship between reproductive intentions and behavior. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to take advantage of a longitudinal data set from Sri Lanka to examine statements about fertility intentions at one point of time and assess subsequent fertility against them, and also to provide a comparison of level of inconsistencies with a few other selected countries where the same type of information exists.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The sample for the present study was drawn from the records of the 1982 Sri Lanka Contraceptive Prevalence Survey (SLCPS) and its follow-up study, the 1985 Sri Lanka Contraceptive Survey (SLCS). The 1982 survey enumerated 4,500 ever-married women 15-49 years old, and covered the whole of Sri Lanka. Because of civil disorder, seven districts in the northern and eastern parts of the country (which constituted only 14 per cent of the total population) were excluded from the

1985 follow-up survey. As defined by the Department of Census and Statistics (1987), the sample for the 1985 follow-up consisted of all 1982 SLCPS respondents who lived in the sample districts, were married at the time of the 1982 SLCPS and also at the time of the 1985 SLCS, and were younger than 50 at the time of the 1985 SLCS. The 1985 follow-up study therefore necessarily covers only women who had been married for at least three years and were 18 or more years of age. The 1985 follow-up study covered 2,310 respondents or 76 per cent of those who were eligible. Computer and manual matching of these women with women interviewed in the 1982 survey yielded 2,219 matched respondents, and their response consistency on demographic variables was found to be high (De Silva, 1991). They had an average time lag of 3 years and 2 months between interviews. There was not much variation in the time difference between the surveys: the longest was 3 years and 4 months while the shortest was 3 years (De Silva, 1990).
Many studies have found that the desire for additional children predicts subsequent behavior relatively better than comparing desired and actual number of children. In the present analysis, whether respondents wanted more children at Time 1 is compared with behavior between Time 1 and Time 2. Over the intersurvey period, 2,047 eligible respondents, for whom there were longitudinal observations available, reported slightly fewer than 1,000 births, but fewer (881) were used in the analyses reported here. Since the reproductive preferences of pregnant women were determined by asking "Do you want to have children in the

who wanted more but had no birth and were not pregnant by Time 2 are defined as "inconsistent." Since the pregnancy status of women at Time 2 is also incorporated in the study, for all practical purposes the longitudinal observations should extend almost up to 4 years. Even though the definition is somewhat loose, a similar definition has been adopted by most other studies with longitudinal observational periods of three to four years (Freedman et al., 1975; Hermalin et al., 1979; Monnier, 1987; Van de Giessen, 1988).
CORRELATES OF INCONSISTENCY
Demographic variables.--As expected, the percentage of women who had another child during 1982-85 decreases significantly with increasing age, marriage duration, and number of living children (Table 2). These estimates follow closely trends in the percentages of women intending more children shown in the first column of Table 2. However, decreases in percentages of women wanting more are generally somewhat larger than those in percentages having a child between surveys. Proportions wanting more are higher at earlier stages in the life-cycle (age < 25, duration of marriage < 5, and < 2 living children) than are proportions who actually had children between the surveys. However, later in the life-cycle, interim fertility often stands higher than expectations. Although it is not shown in Table 2, aggregate inconsistency, which refers to the difference between the percentages having more and wanting more children expressed as a percentage of those wanting more (Hermalin et al., 1979), increases rapidly from negative values to positive values with increas-

ing age, marital duration, and number of living children.
At the individual level, two types of inconsistency are possible. A woman may want to have another child and fail to do so, or she may not want to have another child and have one anyway. The percentage inconsistent among women who wanted more children increases rapidly with age and marital duration, but the number of living children does not show much difference (Column 3 of Table 2). It is evident that considerable proportions of the younger, recently married women had unintended births between the surveys, while the greater failure to have desired additional children among older women and women at higher marriage durations probably is partly a result of subfecundity and the intervention of family planning. These expressions of the intention to have more may be an attempt to communicate their love for children, even though they are, in fact, unable or unwilling to have any more (Westoff and Ryder, 1977). The same pattern of inconsistency has been reported in most longitudinal studies where reproductive preferences (desire for more children) have been compared with subsequent behavior (Bumpass and Westoff, 1969; Coombs, 1979; Hermalin et al., 1979; Nair and Chow, 1980).
Overall inconsistency at the individual level (Column 5 of Table 2) is moderately large at early and intermediate stages of the life-cycle, since the percentage wanting more children, the percentage inconsistent among those who wanted more, and the percentage inconsistent among those who wanted no more, are all moderately large. In general, overall inconsistency at the in-

Categorization was made for four classes: both less educated; husband educated, wife less educated; wife educated, husband less educated; both educated.

Among the ethno-religious categories, about 49 per cent of Moor/Muslim women intended to have more children in 1982, and by 1985 about 54 per cent had done so (Table 2). At the aggregate level, Sinhalese/Buddhist and

facto terminators (Rindfuss et al., 1988).
Whatever the explanation for these discrepancies, if failures to have wanted births and to avoid unwanted births are minimal, then respondents' preferences for additional children combined with a variable giving additional numbers of children wanted could be used to predict future fertility and be incorporated into population projections (Van de Giessen, 1988). This is not attempted in this study. Instead, the extent to which reproductive intentions and other variables predict the occurrence of a live birth during 1982-85 is examined by using multivariate logistic regression.
MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS
Even though the influence of reproductive intentions on subsequent fertility in the context of different life-cycle stages and socioeconomic conditions could be treated in tabular form, logistic regressions which use the dichotomous dependent variable (whether or not had a birth between 1982 and 1985) assess the independent effects of one or another variable after controlling for others. Initially, therefore, all the variables and their first order interactions were included in the "saturated" model and the net effects of the variables were estimated by using GLIM (Baker and Nelder, 1978) software. Selection of the final model involved the elimination of the interaction term with the lowest statistical significance and re-estimation of the model; backward elimination procedure was used. No interaction term was found to be statistically significant, and among the socioeconomic variables, all except husband's and wife's education were

also eliminated from the model because of their nonsignificance.
Since it is a controversial question whether to include or to exclude sterilized cases from the analysis, the present analysis is carried out in two stages. The first model includes those women sterilized, or women whose husbands were sterilized at Time 1, while the second model excludes them.2 The procedure permits examination of the socioeconomic differentials in reproductive behavior between the two models. The final results of the multivariate analysis appear in Table 4, which shows the logistic regression coefficients and odd ratios for the two models. The effect of each independent variable on the response variable is estimated by the odds ratios for each variable category relative to the reference category which has the odds ratio of one. The ratio of less than one indicates less likelihood of having a birth than in the reference group while the ratio of more than one indicates the opposite.
Life-cycle variables such as age, marital duration, and number of living children all show substantial net effects on fertility. The younger the women were and the shorter the durations of their marriages, the more likely they were to report a live birth during 1982-- 85. The relationship was reversed when 1982-85 fertility was compared with number of living children at Time 1; women with larger families had had
2 Reproductive intentions and behavior were examined in a Costa Rican (1976-78 World Fertility Survey-based) longitudinal study which excluded women who were sterilized at the first survey (Stycos, 1984), while Westoff and Ryder (1977) using data from the United States National Fertility Survey of 1970-75 included contraceptively sterilized respondents.

more children over the period than women with small family sizes.
After controlling reproductive intentions and demographic variables, husband and wife education composition shows a significant impact on reproductive behavior in the follow-up period. The likelihood of having a birth in this period was lowest for the couples comprising an educated husband and wife, while the opposite is true for the less-educated couples. However, the odds ratio for having a birth in the intersurvey period for the educated women with less-educated

husbands shows almost the same level as with less-educated couples. Estimates of demographic and education variables reported in both models show a strong consistent pattern of reproductive behavior. Analysis of reproductive intentions and behavior (at least in the Sri Lankan situation) has made no significant distortion when sterilized women were included, and therefore such inclusion could not be considered a serious limitation.
In both models, the logit coefficients for reproductive intentions at Time 1 are strongly related to intersurvey fer-

tility. Women who at Time 1 expressed a desire to have more children, independent of the effects of other independent variables, did have more. However, among the women categorized as "certainly no more" (sterilized) in the first model, a small fraction did report a birth in the follow-up period (Table 4). How did inconsistency occur? As shown in the Table 5, 493 respondents (or their husbands) of the present sample who wanted no more children were reported to be sterilized at Time 1, but 3 per cent of these women had a birth during 1982-85. These discrepancies may be related to a number of factors, of which the first is surgical failure, or the reversal of male or female sterilization3 (Weisberg and Fraser, 1982; Thapa and Vaidya, 1990). A second possibility is that some women were already pregnant at the time of the sterilization (Brown and Schanzer, 1980), and a third is possible errors in matching. Finally, even though this analysis refers to women whose marriages were intact between 1982 and 1985, there may have been some unreported marriage dissolutions, and in such cases where the original sterilization was a vasectomy, inconsistency in reporting sterilization or subsequent fertility is not totally unexpected (Margaret Pyke Center, 1973).
3Even though no Sri Lankan data are available so far, a small proportion of sterilization failures are reported in many clinical studies throughout the world (Lee and Hagen, 1984; Trussell and Kost, 1987; Trussell et al., 1990). On the other hand, from time to time the Family Planning Association of Sri Lanka, which performs the majority of vasectomies, receives requests for reversals from men who have lost a child, remarried, or in later years had second thoughts about sterilization (Basnayake, 1988). A few Sri Lankans are believed to have undergone sterilization reversal operations (often costly) inprivate hospitals and therefore may have been identified as inconsistent.

Moreover, here we are treating those who were sterilized as certainly wanting no more, but there is no guarantee that all sterilized women did not want additional children at the survey date. Recent survey findings from Sri Lanka (1987 SLDHS) show that among sterilized women and women with sterilized husbands about 14 per cent expressed some regret about the sterilization and being unable to have more children when asked: "Do you regret that you (your husband) had the operation not to have any more children?" (Department of Census and Statistics, 1988).
Findings so far indicate that reproductive intentions do predict subsequent behavior, not perfectly but to a considerable extent. The question remains why some women failed to achieve their stated reproductive goals, specifically among those who wanted to cease childbearing. We are dealing with only women's responses on reproductive intentions at Time 1, but their subsequent fertility may be determined by their husbands or third parties, such as women's mothers or mothers-in-law (Coombs and Chang, 1981; Hull, 1983; Morgan, 1985; Clifford et al., 1987; Thomson et al., 1990). Some wives in the 1982 SLCPS reported a difference of opinion with their husbands on desire for additional children, in answer to the question "Do you think he (husband) wants to have more children in the future?" In these cases it was more often the husband who wanted, or was believed to want, another child and the wife who did not want one than vice versa. Fully 79 per cent of disagreements were of the former type. Compared with the woman's reproductive intentions, the

subsequent fertility of these couples may be higher or lower depending on how conflicts over intentions are resolved (Bongaarts, 1990).
The reporting of births in the intersurvey period by women who in Time 1 wanted no more children could be related to a number of factors. First, the desires of some wives to cease childbearing may have been overridden by their husbands' contrary views. Secondly, there may have been a small proportion of genuine changes of attitude; fertility intentions could be viewed as more sequential, allowing for reassessment at any time (Namboodiri, 1972; Rindfuss et al., 1988). Thirdly, changes in intentions might have occurred in response to a child's dying or developing a physical infirmity.4 It is also possible that some of
4 Although data on physical infirmity are unavailable, limited information on the mortality experience of children born between January 1, 1980 and the 1985 survey date was collected. The only deaths that are relevant are those of children born before Time 1 which occurred after the 1982 survey. They are the only deaths which might have caused a revision of reproductive preferences. For the intersur-

these women at Time 1were indicating that they did not want children in the immediate future rather than that they never wanted them. Whatever produced behavior inconsistent with original desires, the majority of inconsistent women probably experienced unwanted births. Therefore, in future research it may be useful to investigate explanations for such inconsistencies in detail. This investigation would enhance our knowledge on how people plan their reproduction and how they modify and achieve their expectations.
COMPARISON OF LEVEL OF INCONSISTENCY: NATIONAL
AND INTERNATIONAL
Since there was another longitudinal study, in Sri Lanka (1975-79) which provided information on reliability of respondents' intentions to
vey period, very few cases of infant and child deaths were found because of the persistence of low infant and child mortality throughout the 1980's in Sri Lanka. Therefore, the variable was not incorporated in the following analysis.

of the explanation may be a downturn in family-size ideas or a trend toward birth intervals. An increasing proportion of contraceptors in the recent past have used contraception not only to terminate childbearing, but also to postpone intended future births, and this process could be related to the observed increase in inconsistency among women who expressed a desire for more children.
International comparison of aggregate inconsistency on a per-annum basis clearly indicates that recent (198285) Sri Lankan levels are not far from the levels of Taiwan (Table 6), although individual levels of inconsistency are much higher in Sri Lanka than in Taiwan. Sri Lankan aggregate inconsistency levels differ from those in the United States. Over 40 per cent of white females wanted more children in 1970 in the United States, but only one-third had actually had more by 1975, possibly because of significant reductions in desired family size or strong intervention of family planning to postpone births (Lee, 1980). Not only in 1975-79 but also in 1982-85, proportionately fewer Sri Lankan women than Taiwanese (1970-74) and United States women (1970-75) were able to avoid undesired births. The higher occurrence of undesired births in Sri Lanka than in the United States and Taiwan may be related to less frequent and less effective use of contraception. Moreover, the practice of inducing abortions to terminate unwanted births in those two countries

was probably more frequent than in Sri Lanka.
When the percentage inconsistent among those who wanted more children is considered on a per-annum basis, the procreation goals set by Sri Lankan women are never totally realized. Proportionately more Sri Lankan women failed to achieve their targets than women in either the United States or Taiwan. Deferring childbearing while seeking better economic opportunities could be the main reason that the Mexicans in the United States have shown the highest inconsistency (Table 6). Even after nine years, 47 per cent of those who wanted another child were inconsistent, while the corresponding Sri Lankan figure was lower (36 per cent) than that with only a three-year longitudinal period. Policy planners in Sri Lanka may be happy to see the decline of the inconsistency among those who wanted to cease childbearing and increase in the latter type, because such a combination undoubtedly produces lower fertility. In fact, rapid decline in fertility is underway in Sri Lanka. As reported in the 1987 SLDHS, the average total fertility rate for the last 5 years was only 2.8, one of the lowest fertility levels in the developing world.
CONCLUSION
This paper has described the reproductive intentions of and their achievement by Sri Lankan women, using a longitudinal data base for the period 1982-85. Findings support the usefulness of reproductive intentions to examine actual behavior. Almost perfect aggregate agreement was observed between 1982 intentions and 1982-85 be-

havior, although this close correspondence was partly the result of the counterbalancing effect of individual level inconsistency. Comparison of earlier with later survey data showed Sri Lankan women's increasing ability to avoid undesired fertility over time. However, undesired fertility is still considerably higher than that observed in either the United States (whites) or Taiwan. Meanwhile, recent civil unrest and deterioration in economic conditions in Sri Lanka possibly motivated many women to revise their family-size ideals downward, and consequently there was a higher failure rate in most recent times among those intending to have another child.

educated couples, while educated couples reported the fewest intersurvey births.
Depending onwives' own intentions and their perception of husband's intentions, some couples show disagreement on their reproductive expectations. Therefore, prediction of subsequent behavior would have been further improved if husbands' intentions at Time 1had been directly available along with those of their wives. Alternatively, improvement in the predictive power of reproductive intentions could be ascertained by focusing only on the women who believe that their husbands also have the same fertility intentions.
