ABSTRACT:This paper focuses on a set of substantive and methodological problems in the study of family-size preferences. Substantively, weask whether traditional social-demographic variables explain proportionately more or less variance in family-size preferences during the mid-1970's than during the period following World War II. Additionally, we inquire whether individual variables, such as race, religion, education, and community size, perform differently in recent years than they did in the postwar period. Methodologically, we question whether analogous trends emerge from including diverse indicators of family-size preferences. Using Multiple Classification Analysis, we find no diminution over the time period in the proportion of variance explained by the socialdemographic predictors considered. In fact, these variables appear to increase in predictive power over time. However, some variables have clearly changed in marginal importance since World War II. Religious affiliation and community size have declined, and race has increased. Educational level has maintained a major position throughout. Finally, the differentials in reproductive preferences are very congruent regardless of the dependent variable used--family-size ideals, preferences, intentions, or ideals for the average American family.

Over the past thirty-five years demographers have tried to show that social and demographic variables are powerful predictors of family-size preferences. On the whole, this effort has been disappointing. Although religious, racial, educational, occupational, and residential divisions have produced some differences in familysize desires, the amount of variance explained has typically been small and is believed to be diminishing. As long age as 1962, Ronald Freedman remarked on the declining role of the "traditional" differentials in family-size preferences (Freedman, 1962). It is now commonplace to assume that social and demographic predictors of reproductive variation have continued to lose importance (Westoff and Westoff, 1971). Indeed, one of the most frequent justifications for new approaches to studying fertility is that the traditional variables have lost most of

their explanatory power (e.g., Turchi, 1975). For example, stimulated by microeconomic theory concerning fertility, demographers have increasingly evoked as predictors various measures of income and other economic indicators (Freedman, 1963; Mincer, 1963; Easterlin, 1969; Cain and Weininger, 1973).
However, no systematic trend analysis of predictors of family-size desires, using modern multivariate techniques, exists. Hence, it is unclear whether the explanatory power of social and demographic variables actually has diminished over time. Do traditional predictors in fact explain less variance in reproductive preferences today than they did, say, during the post-- World War II period? Which predictors are the most promising? Do their effects on family-size preferences remain constant over time? The present paper is designed to address these questions. It is

national stratified samples (see Glenn, 1977, p. 42), it is unlikely that this regular progression of increasing R2 is due to chance factors, particularly since a number of early studies have low R2's and a number of later ones have higher R2's.

therefore have no variance in the statistical sense. We have also made the categories for each variable as comparable as possible throughout. Hence, changes in predictor variation are not, in this type of analysis, responsible for changes in R2. The problem of intercorrelation among predictors is obviated, to a great extent, by the fact that we use the marginal or unique importance of independent variables throughout. Finally, changes in firstorder relations between predictors and family-size preferences will be discussed when the results for individual predictors are presented.
Our results so far contradict the impression that the social-demographic variables explain less variance now than in the past. We believe that this impression may stem from the changing importance over time of particularvariables, a supposition that can be tested by examining the marginal effects of the predictors.
We assess the unique or marginal effect of a predictor by running two regressions, one run with and one run without the vari-

able in question. The percentage change in R2 (adjusted for degrees of freedom) shows the additional explanatory effect achieved by adding a particular predictor. We have added the predictors into the regression according to their temporal priority in the life cycle. We start with ascribed characteristics such as age, sex, and race, then add characteristics acquired early in life, such as religious affiliation and educational level, and finally current characteristics such as community size and family income.
A notable finding in this analysis is that the effects of certain predictors have changed substantially over time (Table 2).
Race. Among the ascribed characteristics, race (essentially a white/black dichotomy) has most radically changed its marginal importance over the time period we are considering. Prior to 1970, adding race to age and sex in the regression increased explained variance (R2) by an average of 8 per cent. Since 1970, race adds over 200 per cent to explained variance (compare the first and second rows of

clear that the entire group of social and demographic predictors of family-size preferences has not lost explanatory power over time. Actually, the group has gained power since our first observations after World War II, a fact that cannot be explained by the changing variance in the dependent variable. Thus, considering major social and cultural cleavages in the society, people's family-size preferences have become more different over time, on the average, rather than more similar. However, now people differ along different dimensions from those of the past. We find that the marginal effects of individual predictors have changed over the years. Family-size preferences appear to have become more similar across religious and rural-urban groups while becoming more different across educational and racial groups. Family-size preferences among income groups appear to be mainly a function of other variables, since inclu-

sion of this predictor adds very little explanatory power.
These results suggest strongly that more attention is required to understand the fertility differentials of the present, rather than assuming them away because the major cleavages of the past--religion and rural-urban differences--are no longer so sharp. For example, is the racial split simply another expression of educational variability? Or are there cultural and social components to black fertility that may transcend, or even short-circuit, educational attainment? Given the poor showing of income as a predictor, must we conclude that economic theories that relate resources to family-size desires are poorly specified? Is it possible that economic considerations come into play only after the effects of other incentives have been operative? Is it also possible that such incentives may even cancel out the effects of economic rationality?

INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION:
THE 1955,1960,1965,1970, AND1973
FERTILITY SURVEYS
Would findings similar to those from the Gallup series result from using different indicators of reproductive preference (family-size expectations or intentions instead of ideals) and differently composed samples (women in the reproductive years instead of adults of all ages and both sexes)? As a test, we have performed a congruent analysis on the 1955 and 1960 Growth of American Families Studies (GAF, 1955 and I960); the 1965 and 1970National Fertility Studies (NFS, 1965 and 1970); and the 1973 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG, 1973). In all of the surveys, women were asked about their family-size expectations or intentions. And, except in 1970, women were asked a standard question on their views of the ideal family size for the average American family. It will be remembered that the Gallup question did not refer to the average American family.
The questions on expectations/ intentions have been tabulated only for women without known fecundity impairments. Obviously, the response to questions on expectations or intentions maybe biased by the knowledge of subfecundity or sterility. Since there were many more voluntary sterilizations in 1970 and 1973 than in 1955,we did not wish to bias any possible real differences among the survey responses because of these changes. The question on ideal family size for the average American family was tabulated for both fecund women and all women. Except for income and occupation, most predictor variables were similar to those in the Gallup surveys. In the fertility surveys we were able to use husband's income rather than family income as suggested by economists (Freedman, 1963; Mincer, 1963; Easterlin, 1969). Additionally, we

have data on the occupations of the husbands in the fertility studies.
As with the Gallup series, we generally find an increase rather than a decrease in the proportional variance explained by the background predictors at the later dates (Table 3). This occurs despite a decline in the variance of the dependent variable since 1960. Thus, neither data set substantiates a recent contraction in the proportion of variance explicable by social-demographic predictors. Congruent with the Gallup series, virtually all of the explained variance isdue to four basicpredictors--race, age, religion, and education. As between Models 1 and 2, it is evident that, in recent years especially, very little was added by husband's income, community size, and husband's occupation (Table 4). This is true for the fertility studies regardless of whether expectations or ideals are considered. We may now assess the contribution of individual predictors. Because of the sampling of the black population in the earlier surveys, strict comparability among the surveys cannot be assured. For this reason, we do not consider the marginal importance of race.
Religious Affiliation. In conformity with a temporal decline in the zero-order importance of religion to family-size preferences, when religious affiliation is added to age and race (Table 4), its declining marginal importance in later years as against 1960is evident. With regard toexpectations or intentions, in the 1960 data, the amount of explained variance more than triples when religious affiliation is added to age and race, whereas a similar addition in 1973 produces an increase of 37 per cent. The tabulations on ideal family size for the average American family in the fertility surveys show a similar trend. Thus, both the Gallup data and the fertility studies agree on the generally declining marginal importance of religious
