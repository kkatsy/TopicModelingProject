ABSTRACT: The life table for the total population, when constructed from the overall age-specific mortality rates, becomes inconsistent with the life tables for its between-heterogeneous subpopulations. The consistent life table for the total population can be derived from those for the subpopulations, when the latter are constructed with radixes proportional to the distribution of these subpopulations at birth. As an example, this consistency approach is used to reconstruct the total life table for the United States for 1984 from those for white males, white females, nonwhite males, and nonwhite females, and to compare it with the corresponding life table computed by the conventional method by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics. The expectation of life at birth for the total population by the consistency approach is found to be 74.37, which is 0.38 year lower than the NCHS number of 74.75.

Overestimation of life expectancy due to heterogeneity in individual frailty has recently been discussed by some authors (e.g., Keyfitz and Littman, 1979; Vaupel et al., 1979;Vaupel and Yashin, 1985). In other words, if a population is divided into a number of between-heterogeneous and within-homogeneous subpopulations, then the life table for the total population constructed in the conventional way from the overall agespecific mortality rates will be inconsistent with the life tables for the subpopulations, because the former will depend on the observed sizes of the subpopulations by age whereas the latter will not. The consistent life table for the total population can be obtained by "adding" the life tables for the subpopulations, when the latter are constructed with radixes proportional to the distribution of these subpopulations at birth. The present paper studies the problem of inconsistency and overestimation of life

expectancy of the conventional total life table by constructing an alternative total life table by the consistency method based on four subpopulations, viz., white males, white females, nonwhite males, and nonwhite females.
The U.S. National Center for Health Statistics (1987) has recently published the abridged life tables by race and sex for the year 1984which include those for white males, white females, nonwhite males, nonwhite females, and total population. These five life tables are constructed independently from the agespecific mortality rates for the respective populations. The expectation of life at birth for the total population is given as 74.75 whereas those for the four subpopulations are, respectively, 71.84, 78.74, 67.36, and 75.05.
The expectation of life at birth (eo) in 1984 is the expected number of years a newborn baby will survive, if, at each age, he (she) is subjected to the mortal-

ity rate for the age as observed in 1984. If the age-specific mortality rates are different for different subpopulations, the newborn baby should be subjected to the mortality rates for the subpopulation to which he (she) belongs. In order to compute eo for 1984 for the total population, it, therefore, becomes important to know the distribution of the subpopulations at birth as observed in 1984. Using this distribution (NCHS, 1986), and the eo's for the subpopulations from above, we find the e0 for the total population is 74.37, implying that the °eo of 74.75 computed by the NCHS directly from the age-specific mortality rates for the total population is an overestimate and is not consistent with the lo's for the four race-sex groups.
The reason for this inconsistency is not difficult to understand. When a life table for the total population is constructed from the age-specific mortality rates, it is recognized that these rates vary from age to age and that, therefore, it is necessary to control for the age structure of the population. This control is achieved by using the age-specific mortality rates and an initial cohort (radix) of 100,000 persons (or any other convenient number), and by ignoring the observed age structure of the population. Likewise, providing life tables for different race-sex groups implies the recognition of the fact that the mortality rates for an age vary from one race-sex group to another and that it is necessary to control for the age-race-sex structure of the population. This control can be achieved by using the age-race-sex specific mortality rates and an initial cohort of 100,000 persons divided among the basic race-sex groups in proportion to their numbers born in 1984 (or any other specific year), and by ignoring the observed age-race-sex structure of the

population. Since the age-specific mortality rates depend on the observed racesex structure of the population, computation of the life table for the total population based on these rates fails to control for the race-sex structure of the population. This gives rise to the inconsistency of the life table numbers for the total population by the conventional method with those for its subpopulations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Suppose a population can be divided into K subpopulations between which age-specific mortality rates vary significantly.Let lxi> TXji5 and exi be the life table values at age x for the subpopulation i for a particular year (lOii= 100,000), and B,, the births to subpopulation i during the same year
k ( . 2 B, = B).
The above three columns of the life table for the total population by the consistency approach will be given by

males, nonwhite females, and total) for 1984 constructed by the conventional method, as published by the NCHS. In order to compute the consistent life table for the total population, we make use of the following distribution of births in 1984 by race and sex:

White males White females Nonwhite males Nonwhite females

1,500,326 1,423,176
379,164 366,475

Total

3,669,141

RESULTS
The four life tables in Cols. 7-10 of Table 1 are kept unchanged from those in Cols. 2-5 except that each lx (or Tx) value is now multiplied by the proportion of births (out of total births) in the corresponding race-sex group. For example, for white males,
/,, = 100,000 x 1,500,326/3,669,141 = 40,890,
To = 7,184,403 x 1,500,326/3,669,141 = 2,937,730.
The four lx and T* values in Cols. 7-10 are added up to obtain the corresponding consistent lx and Tx values for the total life table in Col. 11.For example,
lo = 40,890 + 38,788 + 10,334 + 9,988 = 100,000,
To = 2,937,730 + 3,053,999 + 696,085 + 749,582 = 7,437,397.
The ex values for the consistent total life table in Col. 11are obtained in the usual manner, i.e., by dividing the Tx values , by the corresponding lx values. For example,
eo = 7,437,397/100,000 = 74.37.
We notice that the ex values in Cols. 710remain the same as those in Cols. 2-5 since both lx and the corresponding Tx values are multiplied by the same factor.

However, the ex values for the total population in Col. 11 show some changes from the corresponding values in Col. 6. This finding implies that the ex values (and hence the other life table values as well) for the five life tables in Cols. 2-6 are not internally consistent.
In order to make a better comparison of the conventional total life table with the reconstructed consistent total life table, we present the per cents of overestimation of the lx, Tx, and ex values by the conventional method in Col. 12. For example, the per cent of overestimation of e55 is given by
(24.21 - 23.97) x 100/23.97 = 1.00.
The per cent "errors" in Col. 12 for the values in the conventional total life table reveal some patterns. Since all lx columns start with 100,000, Col. 12does not show any errors in /, values in the first few age groups, but then, the error increases consistently with age. The largest overestimation in lx isfound to be 3.39 per cent in the age group 85+. The Tx values--theoretically, the cumulations of the lx values from the bottom-- show errors right from the first age group. These errors also increase with age, but at slower rates than those in the lx values. The largest overestimation in Tx is 2.78 per cent in the age group 8085. Since ex is the ratio of Tx and lx, the pattern of the errors in exvalues depends on those of 4 and Tx values. The errors in ex increase with age and then start declining. The highest error in ex is an overestimation of 1.00 per cent in the age group 55-60.
DISCUSSION
