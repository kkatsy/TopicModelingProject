Orowan (1955) originally pointed out that the structure of uric acid is very similar to caffein, a known central nervous system (CNS) stimulant, and that serum uric acid (SUA) might therefore prove to be an endogenous cortical stimulant. Orowan further suggested than man's intellectual growth was enhanced by the constant cortical arousal provided by this stimulant. In terms of the evolution of intelligence, the significance of this hypothesis becomes apparent when it is realized that, among mammals, elevated serum uric acid levels are restricted to primates and particularly man.

in SUA, up to an optimal level, lead to improved CNS performance. However, increases beyond this proposed optimal range would lead to impairment of performance, possibly because of cortical overstimulation (see Figure 2). This interpretation is consistent with the known behavioral consequences of other CNS stimulants such as caffein, whose actions are also dose-dependent (Calhoun, 1971; Hahn, 1960).
Clinical evidence exists to support the curvilinearity of the SUA-intelligence association suggested in Figure 2. The LeschNyhan syndrome is an X-linked condition with four clinical characteristics: mental

The general interpretation of Orowan's hypothesis has followed a linear model which predicts a simple correlation between SUA level and intellectual ability (see Figure I ) . However, research and clinical data exist (Stevens and Cropley, 1972) suggesting that the interpretation of Orowan's hypothesis should be based on a curvilinear or inverted-U model, implying a psychologically optimal SUA concentration. This inverted-U hypothesis suggests that increases

retardation, neurological abnormalities, obsessive destructive behavior, and hyperuricemia (Nyhan, 1968; Stanbury et al., 1972). Of central importance here is this association between intellectual retardation and extremely elevated uric acid synthesis. Patients with this disorder have SUA levels as high as 24 mg./lOO ml. and excrete three to six times the normal amount of uric acid in their urine. The discoverers of this syndrome have speculated that the retardation found in these patients may be due, in part, to this presence of highly elevated SUA. They suggest that this CNS stimulant may have a toxic effect when present in large quantities (Nyhan et al., 1965). Seegmiller (1972) has questioned the direct cause-effect relationship between this disorder and hyperuricemia, suggesting that the causal factors may be somewhat more complex. However, while the exact relationship between highly elevated levels of uric acid and this syndrome is not clear at this point, the association is well documented. This association can be viewed as sufficient clinical evidence to justify testing the concept illustrated in Figure 2.
Behaviorally optimal levels of excitation

or arousal are quite well recognized in psychology. For example, the Yerkes-Dodson law of anxiety and learning demonstrates that some anxiety heightens an individual's learning performance while deviations in either direction from this optimal level produce a decrement in learning performance. A similar phenomenon is predicted (Stevens and Cropley, 1972) for levels of SUA and CNS efficiency. That is, it should be possible to demonstrate experimentally the existence of an optimal level of SUA vis-a-vis the relationship between subjects' serum uric acid levels and their scores on learning tests. In addition, it should be possible to support the optimal level hypothesis epidemiologically; this could be done, for example, by demonstrating progressively less deviation from the optimum concentration in a succession of groups selected on the basis of apparently increasing levels of cortical efficiency.
MATERIALS AND METHODS Uric acid was measured on the Hycel Mark X with duplicate assays done on the technicon SMA 12-60; the correlation between both methods of analysis was 0.93. The results quoted are all from the Mark X. Precision was evaluated by running replicate assays on successive days and a correlation coefficient of 0.99 was obtained between these assays. The stability of serum uric acid levels within the individual was determined by resampling 48 subjects two or more days after their initial sample. The correlation coefficient between the first and second sample assays was 0.79. The actual difference between assays was small and generally less than 0.5 mg./lOO ml. This observation agrees with other findings such as those by Banerjee and Saha (1967) on individual serum uric acid level stability. The data studied in the present paper come from four different male populations.

(Females were excluded from this study because the relationship between serum uric acid level and the menstrual cycle is not clear at this time.) Population 1 consists of the over two thousand 18 to 22 year old male subjects of the Tecumseh study (Mikkelsen, Dodge, and Valkenberg, 1965). Population 2 consists of 126 samples from males aged 18 to 22, submitted to the Saskatchewan Provincial Laboratory for routine premarital serum analysis. The third population is made up of 115 male undergraduate university students aged 18 to 22. The fourth population consists of 15 male university faculty members whose age was greater than that of the first three populations.
The learning ability of Population 3 was assessed (Stevens, 1973) in a doubled-blind experimental design using four learning tests. The four learning measures consisted of Pascal and Jenkins' (19S9) HunterPascal Concept Formation Test (H-P), Berg's (1948) Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Ammons and Ammons' (1959) Standard Anagram Task (SAT), and Cook, Heim, and Watts' (1963) Word in Context Test (WINC). All four of these learning measures assess the apparently unique primate ability to form and use concepts (Razran, 1971).
PROCEDURE
The administration of the learning tasks and the taking of the blood sample involved an individual and a group experimental session. In order to reduce possible order effects on the learning test results, half the subjects had their individual sessions first, while the remaining half of the subjects took part in a group session first. The lapse time between sessions was from 0 to 7 days with the average lapse being 4.3 days. The group sessions each involved from 7 to 14 subjects and lasted about 2l/2 hours.
During the group sessions, the subjects

completed the SAT and WINC learning measures and gave a registered laboratory technician a 25cc. blood sample which was immediately spun off and refrigerated. Serum uric acid assays were completed within 3 days. The individual sessions lasted approximately forty minutes during which the subjects took the H-P and WCST learning tests. An extensive number of control measures relevant to the assessment of the dependent and independent variables was taken in the group and individual experimental sessions. These control measures included questions pertaining to diet, past and present state of health, general level of anxiety, and motivation.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Population 3 was divided into low, middle, and high SUA levels. The low and high groups consisted of those subjects with the lowest and highest 10 per cent of the sample's SUA levels respectively. The relationship between the students' obtained learning scores and the 3 SUA groups is shown in Figure 3. There is improved performance on all four learning tests as the serum uric acid concentration increases to 5.0 mg./lOO ml., and three of the tests suggest a decrease in performance as the SUA level exceeds 5.0 mg./lOO ml. Figure 3 is therefore quite supportive of the hypothesized curvilinear, or inverted-U, relationship between SUA and learning. However, a statistical examination of the data was somewhat more conservative in its support of the hypothesis, as chi-square tests of association only confirmed the SUAlearning hypothesis for the H-P and WCST measures of learning (p <O.O25). The apparent association between SUA and scores on the SAT and WINC tests, as shown in Figure 3, may be due to chance findings.

as suggesting that while this study indicates that the optimal level of SUA is 5.0 mg./lOO ml., other data suggest that a slightly higher concentration may be optimum. The actual ideal range may have to be determined by experimental manipulation of uric acid levels. Such investigations will also have the advantage of being able to weigh the cause-effect issue more directly than the correlational studies mentioned here.
The results are generally supportive of the optimal concentration hypothesis for serum uric acid; that is, there is evidence, based on data from psychological and epidemiological assessments, which suggests that behaviorally manifested maximum cortical efficiency in males is associated with an SUA level of approximately 5.0 mg./lOO ml., and that deviations in either direction from this concentration are associated with less effective intellectual functioning, presumably because of hypo- or hyper-CNS stimulation. It therefore appears that Orowan's notion of the evolutionary significance of SUA may be at least partially correct.
While the apparently adaptive influence of optimally elevated SUA levels is neither sufficient nor necessary for intellectual superiority, it may indeed have conferred a selective advantage in the evolution of intelligence. The significance of these results lies in this apparent correlation between the male population's mean SUA level and a psychologically optimal SUA concentration for males. The authors anticipate that a similar correlation will be found between the female mean SUA level and their psychologically optimal level of urate concentration. This finding suggests that the evolutionary rise in serum uric acid levels, to the present mean level, was not without some favorable result.

A number of cross-cultural and crosssocioeconomic surveys, such as those by Healeyetal. (1966) and Duff etal. (1968), have suggested that various ethnic and economic populations may be relatively or actually hypo- or hyperuricemic. These states are presumably due to a combination of genetic predisposition, dietary preferences and general dietary deficiencies. Behavioral scientists have to date shown little interest in such epidemiological findings in spite of the association between SUA levels and the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This disinterest is presumably because these variations in SUA levels have not been directly linked to any obvious clinical disorder within the various ethnic and economic populations studied. However, if later experimental research upholds the findings of the correlational investigation outlined here, there will be a rather strong case in favor of cultural patterns and individual habits which support the maintenance of an optimal level of serum uric acid.
SUMMARY
Psychological and epidemiological data from four different male populations were examined. The results support the hypothesis that, within yet to be definitively defined optimal concentrations, serum uric acid acts to facilitate learning and that deviations from this optimal limit are associated with a decrement in learning ability. The findings are related to Orowan's notion (1955) of the evolution of human intelligence and the general concern surrounding cultural and individual factors that influence the biological correlates of human behavior.
