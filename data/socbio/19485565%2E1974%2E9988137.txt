It is generally maintained that the incidence of mortality is greatly influenced by the social status of any group. People of higher social status have lower mortality rates because of better knowledge of the availability and use of medical facilities and an easy access to expensive medical aid. Moreover, they are more concerned about sanitary conditions and hygiene than the people of lower social status.
Incidence of mortality is also believed to be related to fertility, and it is maintained that when the child mortality rate is high, fertility also goes up because parents produce more offspring to ensure the survival of a few. Evidence of this fact can be had from Indian census data on birth and death rates during the past century. From 1871, when the first census was taken in the country, until 1931, the growth rate was very small and in some cases it was nearly nil, mainly because the birth and death rates were both very high.
This paper analyzes the incidence of child mortality in relation to the social status and fertility of Indian women. Social status has been taken as an independent variable, child mortality as a dependent variable, and fertility as an in-

tervening variable. It is based on the assumptions that (a) the higher the social status, the lower will be the incidence of child mortality, and (b) the lower the incidence of child mortality, the lower will be the family size.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study includes 311 married women living in Chandigarh. These women were divided into four status categories: (1) higher educated working women; (2) higher educated nonworking women; (3) less educated nonworking women; and (4) less educated working women. The higher educated categories were comprised of women who had completed ten or more years of schooling; the less educated categories, of women with less than ten years of schooling, including the barely literate and illiterate. There were 95 women in Category 1, 75 in Category 2, 75 in Category 3, and 66 in Category 4.
Since education is one of the important indices of social status, it is evident that the higher educated women are higher in status than the less educated or illiterate. However, the same kind of ranking cannot be made for occupational prestige, as the

nonworking women cannot be placed on any continuum of occupational prestige. Among higher educated women, women in the working category were more highly educated than the women in the nonworking category. On the other hand, among less educated women, the educational level was lower among working than among the nonworking women.
Education was the only variable by which the women could be ranked into status categories. However, husband's status was a common factor to all women. Therefore, it was proposed to take the indices of husband's status, i.e., their occupational status, their educational attainments, and their economic position. A status index consisting of these three variables was prepared.
The criterion for the measurement-ofstatus index was adopted from Centers (1949). Accordingly, educational attainments, occupations, and income of the husbands were divided into seven groups, and an individual's score was obtained in each case by adding the numerical values assigned to each of these three indices.
The average score was the highest for husbands of higher educated working women and the lowest for husbands of less educated working women. Husbands of women in the other two categories were also in the same ranking order as their

wives. Thus, the husbands' status index corresponded to the wives' educational ranking. The mortality analysis was made in relation to these four status categories.
FINDINGS
In the total sample, the 311 women gave birth to a total of 1,075 children of which 960 were living and 115 had died, most between the ages of 0-5 years. In terms of percentage, 89 per cent of the children were living. However, the percentage was different in each status category. In the first and highest category, 93 per cent of the total children born were living; in the second status category, 92 per cent; in the third category, 91 per cent; and in the fourth status category, 81 per cent.
Table 1 clearly shows the relationship between child mortality and social status and the number of ever-born children and the number of survivors. In the fourth category, the incidence of mortality is the highest so that the number of survivors is much lower than in the third category. The relationship between child mortality and social status becomes still more clear when analyzed by theproportion of women who had lost children in each status category.
In the first and highest category, 87 per cent of the women had not experienced any child mortality in their family; of the

remaining, 12 per cent had lost one child each, whereas only 1 per cent had lost two children irrespective of the number of children born to them. There was no incidence of mortality among women who had only one liveborn child.
In the second category, 77 per cent had lost no liveborn child; 20 per cent had lost one child each; and another 3 per cent had lost two children each, irrespective of the number of children born to them. Here again, there was no incidence of mortality among women who had one liveborn child; but compared to the first category, the number of such women was small.
The percentage of women experiencing no mortality declines further in the third category where 72 per cent had lost no children; 20 per cent had lost one child each; 7 per cent had lost two children each; and 1 per cent had lost four children.
The percentage of women having experienced no child mortality dropped sharply in the last category of less educated working women. Only 48 per cent had not lost any child, whereas the remaining 52 per cent had lost one, two, or more than two children.

Our assumption that the higher the social status, the lower the incidence of mortality is clearly supported by these findings.
As far as the relationship between fertility and mortality is concerned, in the first and highest status category the incidence of mortality was the lowest and the mean number of children born was also the lowest. In the second category, the incidence of mortality was a little higher than the first category and the mean number of children was also higher. This trend did not continue for fertility in the third and the fourth categories, although the incidence of mortality did continue in the same hierarchical order. The incidence of mortality was the highest in the fourth and lowest category; but fertility was not the highest because there were five women who had no children although they had been married for 6 to 9 years and there were four recently married women, two of whom were pregnant at the time of the survey. Had these exceptions not existed, the fertility of the fourth group would have been the highest.

mortality and fertility in the four status categories. I t is clear from the totals column that the percentage of children claimed by death was the lowest ·when women had one to two livebora children. With a few exceptions, with the samenumber of live births, variation in different categories is also according to the hierarchical order of status categories. It appears

that a lowered mortality rate is also accompanied by a lowered fertility rate.
In summary, it may be concluded that the incidence of child mortality greatly depends upon social status; the higher the social status, the lower the incidence of mortality. In addition, when the incidence of mortality is lower, fertility is also lower.
