This study reports a portion of the results of research on religious affiliation and family planning conducted under the auspices of the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development in Comilla-Kotwali thana1 East Pakistan in 1968. The Academy conducts rural development programs--family planning, agricultural extension, rural public works, youth education, formation of cooperative societies, and female education and home development--on an experimental basis for possible adoption at the national level. As early as 1961, the Academy initiated a pilot family-planning program referred to as the "organizer approach"2 in four villages of the thana and by 1964 the number rose to 22. In the
1 The thana is an administrative unit of approximately one hundred square miles.
2 The "organizer approach" utilized village women (organizers) who were nominated by their local cooperative society for training and instruction in family planning at the Academy. Upon completion of training, they conducted the following activities in their villages: visits with the village women to discuss and explain all facets of family planning, the sale of contraceptive supplies (condoms and foam tablets), and the keeping of systematic records on women who purchased contraceptives.

latter part of 1964, a new program was implemented that covered all 247 villages of the thana and utilized commercial distribution channels for sale of contraceptives. In November of the same year an IUCD clinic was established.
Research studies have been conducted by the Academy to evaluate these familyplanning programs. This research includes studies on family-planning practices and the social and demographic characteristics of persons who practice it. This information has been used to depict the social and demographic differentials in family planning and to make inferences concerning future trends in fertility planning. One of the differentials which has been found consistently is between Muslims and Hindus, that is, Hindus have been found to have higher proportions who practice family planning than Muslims (Khan and Choidin, 1965; Stoeckel, 1968; Stoeckel and Choudhury, 1969a; Stoeckel and Choudhury, 1969Ô). The present study will investigate further this religious differential and will attempt to identify the factors which may account for the relationship

between religious affiliation and practice of family planning.
Although the religious differential may be the result of ideological differences, there is apparently no difference in the religious doctrines concerning family planning (Kirk, 1969; Fagley, 1965). Since the differential may not be attributed to differences in the Hindu and Muslim ideologies, then other factors must be considered as a possible explanation. Such social and demographic factors as socioeconomic status (husband's occupation, education, and landholding), women's age, age at marriage, education, total living children, and cooperative membership must be considered as possible reasons for the religious differentials and will be controlled when testing the relationship between religious affiliation and practice of family planning.3 If one religious group has a higher proportional representation of one of these variables and the variable is related to practice, then the interpretation that religion is the explanatory variable would be spurious. If the differential is still present even while controlling on the above social and demographic factors, this may lend

support to the notion that the Muslim's practice of purdah4 may have some effect on the Muslim-Hindu differential. The fact that the Hindu woman moves more freely in society at large than does her Muslim counterpart may result in a greater exposure to changes being brought about through the development programs (family planning) and thus, she may have a greater opportunity to be affected by these changes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data were collected through the use of a simple two-stage sample design. In the first stage, 20 villages were selected from a total of 247 in Comilla-Kotwali thana on the basis of probability proportional to size. The second stage consisted of listing all currently married females in each village and then randomly selecting 80 women from each. The 1,600 currently married women were then interviewed by 10 female interviewers from January to March 1968. Female interviewers were used because in pretesting it was found that as a result of the purdah system which requires the seclusion of women, it was virtually impossible for males to interview females.
4 Purdah is the system in Islam which requires the seclusion of women.

* Fifteen respondents classified in the "Other" occupational category were omitted from the analysis. t Nine respondents classified in Maktob, religious education, were omitted from the analysis.

Practice of family planning was obtained by two questions to identify those women currently using contraception and those women whohad ever used contraception. The questions used toobtain these data were: "Have you oryour husband ever used any methods of family planning?" and "Areyou or your husband now using any methods?".
RESULTS
As expected, Hindus have a significantly higher proportion practicing family planning than Muslims (see Table 1). Three times as many Hindus have ever practiced family planning, while over four times as many Hindus as Muslims are currently practicing some method of contraception.
The results of testing the relationship between religious affiliation and practice

of family planning while holding constant husband's socioeconomic status are shown in Table 2.When controlling husband's occupation, those Hindu women whose husbands are "farmers" have significantly greater proportions than Muslims who have ever practiced family planning. In the occupational categories "Farming" and "Business and skilled" there is also a significant difference between Hindu and Muslim women who are currently practicing some method ofcontraception. However, for those women whose husbands are "Business and skilled" the Hindus and Muslims who have ever practiced family planning do not differ significantly. These findings may have resulted from the fact that Muslim women whose husbands are in the "Business and skilled" occupations tried some method of contraception when

the program was first started but have stopped using it. A number of factors may have accounted for their termination. For example, it has been found that high proportions of Muslims terminate contraceptive use because of pressures from religious leaders (Mulas) in the villages. Even though Muslims in this high occupational status (where adoption of family planning would occur first) initially adopted at a rate no different from that of the Hindus, pressures may have been brought to bear on them to quit practicing.
In the lowest occupational status, "Unskilled," there are no significant differences between Muslims and Hindus in the proportion who have ever practiced or who are currently practicing family planning. A possible explanation of these findings may be that Muslim women in this low occupational status are not able to observe the seclusion of purdah because they are needed to work in the fields (Kirk, 1969; Wilber, 1964). They are more likely to come in contact with the development programs and their personnel and this may allow them to find out more about family planning than would be expected if they observed purdah strictly. By not being completely secluded, the Muslim women whose husbands are employed in "Unskilled" occupations may have as great a chance of being exposed to family planning programs as their Hindu counterpart. Because of this increased exposure, these Muslim women may be as likely to adopt some method of contraception as the Hindu women.
When husband's education is used as a control, the expected differences between religious affiliation and practice of family planning occur only in the two lowest educational groups ("No education" and "Class 1-3"). Significantly more Hindus than Muslims have ever practiced and are currently practicing some method of con-

traception. This, however, is not the case for the more educated Muslims and Hindus ("Class 4-6" and "Class 7 and above"). For these two educational groups, there are no significant differences in practice of family planning. Hence, higher educational attainment dissolves the religious differences in the practice of family planning.
The results of controlling the relationship between religious affiliation and practice of family planning by landholding are also shown in Table 2. In the two groups which own land, significantly lower proportions of Muslims than Hindus have ever practiced and are currently practicing family planning. However, in the lowest group, "No land," the differences between Muslims and Hindus are not significant. Perhaps the economic hardships produced by having no land transcends the importance of religious values in influencing the family-planning practices of both religious groups.
As seen in Table 3, the expected relationship between religious affiliation and practice of family planning is not maintained throughout the age structure. In the two oldest age groups, "30-39" and "4049," Hindus have significantly greater proportions than Muslims who have ever practiced and are currently practicing family planning. In the younger age groups, "10-19" and "20-29," no significant differences are found between religious affiliation and practice of family planning.
One explanation for these findings may be that the religions differ in their norms concerning family size. Additional data from the present sample indicate that Hindus had less traditional norms about family size than Muslims (Mosena, 1970), that is, they desired smaller families than Muslims. However, until the desired number of children is reached, the Hindus will probably not practice family planning in any greater proportions than will the Mus-

lims. Since desired family size is generally not reached before 30 years of age, this may account for the lack of significant differences in practice of contraception between thereligions in the age group "1019" and"20-29."
Table 3 also shows the results of con-

trolling age at marriage in the relationship between religious affiliation and practiceof family planning. For those women who are married below the age of 15 almost three times as many Hindus as Muslims have ever practiced family planning while over five times as many Hindus are cur-

rently practicing some method of contraception. However, for those women married after they were IS years of age, there are no significant differences between the religious groups in their practice of family planning.
In a society such as East Pakistan where prepubertal marriage is orthodox, the postponement of marriage represents a break with traditional norms. Thus, it would appear that those who delay marriage irrespective of their religious affiliation have similar family-planning practices.
As seen in Table 4, the relationship between religious affiliation and practice of family planning does not hold when woman's education is controlled. Hindu women with no education have significantly greater proportions who have ever practiced and are currently practicing family planning than do Muslim women with no education. However, there are no significant differences between Muslim and Hindu women who have had some education.
This latter result is consistent with the findings when husband's education was controlled. That is, Muslims and Hindus with higher education simply do not differ in their family-planning practices.
When the number of living children is used as the control variable, there is no consistent relationship between religious affiliation and practice of family planning (see Table 4). Hindu women who have four or more living children have significantly greater proportions who are practicing or have ever practiced family planning than do Muslim women with similar numbers of children. This relationship, however, does not appear when the women have fewer than four children, although there is a significant difference between Hindus and Muslims with "1-3 living children" who have ever practiced family planning.

These findings may have resulted from the fact that Hindu women desired smaller family sizes than do Muslim women (Mosena, 1970). Thus, more Hindu women will probably have attained their desired number by the third or fourth child and will, therefore, have greater proportions who practice family planning. Since Hindu women are more receptive to family planning, they may be more likely to begin using contraception even before they have attained their desired number of children in order to space them. Thus, the proportions of Hindus with "1-3 children" who are currently practicing family planning may not be significantly different from their Muslim counterparts even though there is a significant difference between religious groups in those who have ever practiced family planning.
Those women who have had no children represent an extreme group for each religion since both religions stress that women must have some children. These childless women in both religions probably do not even consider family planning because of their desire to have at least some children. Thus, the differential practice of family planning is not likely to appear until after several children are born.
Almost five times as many of the Hindus as Muslim women whose husbands are not cooperative members have ever practiced family planning and six times as many are currently practicing some method of contraception (see Table 4). When the husbands are members of a cooperative, there are no significant differences between the two religions in their practice of family planning.
An explanation of these findings may be that in the early stages of the familyplanning programs in Comilla, the female organizers were nominated by the local cooperative societies. The recruitment of male agents was also done through the

cooperatives. Therefore, both Muslim and Hindu women whose husbands were cooperative members were more likely to be exposed to the family-planning programs. By being more exposed, the Muslim women were probably as likely as the Hindu women to break with tradition regarding family limitation and to practice family planning.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
An investigation into the dynamics of the Muslim-Hindu differential in practice of family planning has been conducted by controlling upon the social and demographic factors that must be considered as possible reasons for the differential. The findings indicate that when the control variables are applied, the MuslimHindu differential is inconsistent and often insignificant. The following conclusions can be drawn from these findings.
First, whenever the religious differential in practice of family planning is found, social and demographic controls must be considered since the apparent relationship between religious affiliation and practice of family planning may be spurious.
Second, the dynamics of the religious differential and practice of family planning are clearly demonstrated by looking at the instances where the differential disappears. The relationship does not hold

in the cases where the women are most affected by traditional norms or modern orientations. In these two extreme categories the Muslim and Hindu women are in some way equalized in their practice of family planning. Those childless Muslim and Hindu women under the traditional pressure to have at least some children do not differ in their practice of family planning because none of these women will probably practice any method of contraception until they have had at least some children. On the other extreme, when both Muslim and Hindu women delay marriage, go to school, or have husbands with higher education and who are cooperative members, they are displaying more modernized characteristics and also do not differ significantly in their practice of family planning.
Thus, if practice has an effect on fertility (assuming the use-effectiveness of contraceptives to be the same for both religions) the Muslim-Hindu fertility differential which has been found in numerous studies in Pakistan and India may be expected to diminish as the country develops and becomes more modernized. This is not to imply, however, that the fertility differential will disappear. Widow remarriage which is allowed by the Muslims and forbidden by the Hindus should continue to result in higher fertility for Muslims in the older segments of the age structure.
