Parent-offspring studies provide an important tool for assessing, to a limited extent, the magnitude of the genetic control of human growth. Correlations between the statures of parents and offpsring are generally significant, suggesting that parental stature contributes to a child's genetic potential for growth in height (Garn, 1962; Tanner, 1960; Livson, McNeill, and Thomas, 1962). With parents classified into various mating combinations according to their stature, Garn (1962) noted size differences in offspring in a direction expected from the parental-stature mating combinations. Garn's data comprise the first three years of life; the present data extend Garn's observation through middle childhood for American Negro and white children.
METHODS
Our sample of clinically normal Philadelphia Negro and white school children numbered 837, 6 through 13 years of age: 216 white males, 168 white females, 210 Negro males, and 243 Negro females. Their statures were measured to the nearest 0.1 mm. (Malina, 1968), while parental statures were reported to the nearest one-half inch on a questionnaire circulated to the parents. Hence, the study assumes that errors in reported parental heights are randomly dis-

tributed and do not cluster at given intervals, due to repeated under- or overestimation. Reported statures were symmetrically distributed, and the mean values agree favorably with adult stature data from a variety of sources (Stoudt, Damon, and McFarland, 1960; National Center for Health Statistics, 1965; Karpinos, 1961).
Parent statures were converted to sex and race-specific T-scores. These were grouped into short (S), medium (M), or tall (T) categories, with the following range for each (Garn, 1962): T-score below 45, short; T-score between 45 and 55, medium; Tscore above 55, tall. Parental pairs were then classified into six mating combinations according to stature: three homogeneous (S X S, M X M, T X T) and three heterogeneous (S X M, S X T, M X T) (Garn, 1962). T-scores for the children's stature were calculated by their age, sex, and race, and then grouped according to the parentalstature mating combinations.
RESULTS
Mean T-scores and standard deviations for children's stature according to parentalstature mating combinations are presented in Table 1. T-scores of children gradually increase from low values for the offspring of S X S parents to maximum values for offspring of T X T parents. Analysis of vari-

ance for each mating type indicated no significant sex and race differences within each. The data were then combined for both sexes and races within each parental-stature mating combination. Analysis of variance of the combined data indicated significant differences (p > 0.001) among the six parental-stature combinations.
The data were subsequently analyzed for independence among means by the Kramer (1956) extension of the Duncan Multiple Range Test (Edwards, 1960) to groups of unequal size. By a series of comparisons with each pair of means, the significance of the difference between any specific pair of means is determined. The extremes of the mating combinations (S X S, T X T) are significantly different from each other and from the other parental-stature mating combinations (p > 0.05). The remaining parental-stature mating combinations are generally similar hi mean values, with no definitive trends in significance. Children of the M X T parental-stature combinations are significantly taller than children of S X M and M X M combinations, but not significantly different from offspring of S X T matings. Children of the S X T parentalstature combinations, however, are not significantly taller than children of S X M and M X M combinations. Similarly, offspring of S X M and M X M matings do not differ significantly from each other.
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates the significant role of parent size in determining the size of their offspring during growth. Tall parents (T X T) tend to have tall children, while short parents (S X S) tend to have short children. The statures of offspring of the remaining parental mating types (S X M, S X T, M X M, M X T) are generally similar and intermediate in value between the extremes. These observations are consistent for American Negro and white children of both sexes.

The foregoing results agree favorably with those for children from birth to three years of age reported by Garn (1962) (Table 2). The mean T-scores are practically identical for all mating types except M X T. The M X T mean T-score in the present study closely approximates the other heterogeneous matings, while it more closely approximates the T X T mating in Garn (1962).
The ranges of variation within each heterogeneous parent-mating type are generally similar in both studies. On the other hand, variability within the specific homo-

were compared for both age groups in the three homogeneous mating types. T-scores for stature show no age effect in offspring of S X S and M X M combinations. The mean T-scores of the older age groups are greater in children of T X T parent mating types. However, in terms of maturity status (skeletal age compared to chronological age; see Malina, 1968) the younger age group is more advanced than the older age group in the three homogeneous mating combinations. Consistent age and maturity effects in our female sample are, therefore, not evident.

geneous parent-mating combinations is consistently greater in the present sample than in Garn's (1962) series. The age range of our study is both older and greater (6 to 13 years) than Garn's (birth to 3 years) series. Offspring of different parental mating types undoubtedly include children whoare at different stages of growth and maturity. Further, some of the children in the present sample are probably in or entering adolescence, with its characteristic variability. This would be especially true of girls. To evaluate the possibility of age and maturity effects in our female samples, we arbitrarily divided them into two age groups, 6 to 9 years and 10 to 13years. T-scores for stature

SUMMARY
The relationship between parent size and the stature of their offspring was considered in a cross-sectional sample of American Negro and white children 6 through 13 years of age. Parents were classified into six mating combinations according to their stature. Analysis of the children's stature by parental-stature mating combinations indicated a well-defined trend related to parent size from short to tall for white and Negro children of both sexes.
