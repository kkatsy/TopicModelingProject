ABSTRACT: Methods of geographic analysis can be used with historical demographic data in order to investigate the process of population expansion and settlement formation. Such analyses provide information regarding assumptions made by many population genetic models. These methods were applied to data from north-central Massachusetts (1700-1850) as part of an ongoing project on population growth and genetic structure. Three methods were used for analysis: nearest neighbor analysis, analysis of settlement history, and rank size analysis. Nearest neighbor analysis shows the area was settled quickly, and the final distribution of populations was patterned, suggesting a strong relationship of migration and distance. Settlement history shows a pattern of early fissioning of towns, and fusioning in later periods. Rank size analysis shows there was heterogeneity of population size, but the area did not show a strong tendency for the development of central places during this time period. The potential genetic effects of settlement formation are discussed.

Studies of the genetic structure of human populations, and anthropological genetics in general, seek to determine the nature of genetic variation (among and within populations), and to explain such variation. The use of most models in population genetics requires simplifying assumptions to be made. The problem here is that one is never certain whether a particular outcome reflects a hypothesized cause or is simply indicative of the violation of certain assumptions. The interpretation of measures of genetic variation requires additional information, particularly with reference to the culture, ecology, demography, and history of a set of populations. Seldom can interpretation proceed strictly from measures of genetic variation. At

the very least, some geographic or historical data are needed.
Many models of population structure require assumptions which are inappropriate when considering human populations, such as constancy of population size and migration rates over time, a single founding population for a set of subpopulations, isotropic migration, random mating, and many others. Recently, studies have attempted to assess the extent to which these assumptions hold. In the process, a number of interesting effects have been demonstrated which show the uniqueness of human populations. Such effects include settlement formation (Swedlund, 1984), non-Markovian migration (Kramer, 1981), kin-structured migration

(Fix, 1978), return migration (Relethford and Lees, 1983), and densitydependent migration (Wood et al., 1985; Relethford, 1986a), among others.
It is interesting to note that most of these studies ask essentially demographic questions, dealing with factors such as population size, migration patterns, and mating systems. The nature of such effects are best assessed from demographic data directly, and not inferred from genetic data. Biological data are of course necessary to our efforts, but it is my feeling that we have tended to overemphasize the collection and analysis of biological data to the exclusion of demographic, ecological, and historical data (of course there are exceptions to this). Both approaches are necessary if we are to understand the causes and the effects of genetic variation.
In a recent and enlightening paper, Swedlund (1984) has demonstrated how historical data may be used to provide an understanding of the genetic consequences of a population's history. Also, research on historical population structure in Oxfordshire parishes (e.g., Boyce et al., 1968) has demonstrated how deviations from assumed settlement pattern can affect migration. This work, and others, show how a thorough insight into the settlement formation and subsequent demographic history of p population can aid in resolving many questions in the study of human population structure.
The purpose of the present paper is to document the process of settlement formation in north-central Massachusetts during the period from 1700 to 1850. This paper has three specific goals. The first, and most general, goal is to il-

lustrate the use of certain models from economic geography in assessing population history and potential genetic effects. The second goal is comparison with other studies from historical Massachusetts (Swedlund 1975,1984) in order to test the effects of variation in physical environment on the settlement process. The third goal is to provide an in-depth historical background of the region for an ongoing study of demographic change and population structure.
POPULATION HISTORY
In recent years, more attention has been given to the analysis of the effects of demographic change on populations structure (e.g., Swedlund et al., 1976; Brennan and Relethford, 1983; Relethford, 1985a). Recently, I have begun a project focusing on the effects of rapid population growth on the genetic structure of human populations. This project revolves around the analysis of vital records from four towns in northcentral Massachusetts, covering the period from 1740 to 1850. Vital records were chosen for analysis (especially marriage records) since the questions asked about population structure are essentially demographic in nature and can best be assessed using demographic data. Historical populations were chosen over contemporary groups due to the advantages of assessing short-term and long-term trends from historical data (Swedlund, 1978). Eighteenth-and nineteenth-century Massachusetts was chosen due to the rapid population growth, during that phase of American history (Potter, 1965) and the widespread availability of vital records from

the area during this time (Hanson and Rutherford, 1981).
Census statistics were examined to locate an area which not only showed rapid population growth, but also had populations of varying size at any given time period. In this way, the effects of population size on population structure could be assessed temporally and spatially. Four towns from north-central Massachusetts were chosen: Gardner, Hubbardston, Leominster, and Barre, all within Worcester County.
The north-central section of Massachusetts is characterized as uplands, consisting of rolling hills with a maximum elevation of roughly 1,100 feet (Bearse, 1971). This topography differs from that of the Connecticut River Valley (studied extensively by Swedlund and colleagues), thus allowing a contrast of environments. Historically, the north-central region of Massachusetts was settled later than other regions in the state. The earliest settlements in Massachusetts occurred along the eastern coast, and by the 1670's, settlements had formed in the Connecticut River Valley, as part of a northern expansion beginning earlier from the southern coast of Connecticut (Friis, 1968). During the seventeenth century there were few settlements in the north-central region of the state, with exceptions such as the town of Lancaster (settled in 1645) established as a post for future fur trade routes (McManis, 1975). Rapid settlement in the region began after the Peace of Utrecht in 1715,with many land grant towns being established in the mid 1700's (Sly, 1928).
Population growth was related to the expansion of new towns in colonial Massachusetts. Population growth was rapid during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, due mostly to relatively low

mortality and high fertility, with immigration having only a minor effect after initial settlement (Potter, 1965; Lockridge, 1970; Smith, 1972; Swedlund et al., 1976). As the population grew, more expansion and settlement took place in order to meet increased demands for land. It appears that early settlers found the land to be disappointing since it was so hilly and rough (with the exception of the fertile Connecticut River Valley) (McManis, 1975).The initial form of settlement was similar to the European open field system, where all inhabitants lived in a nuclear village and farming took place in large open fields outside of this area. All inhabitants farmed on bits and pieces of these fields. This system gradually gave way to a system of independently owned farms, where families lived and worked. This later division of land acted to encourage further geographic expansion, since land became a prerequisite for marriage. As in many European cultures, the settlers practiced impartible inheritance, whereby the land was divided among sons. Depletion of soil, and lack of suitable land for all sons, led to further expansion as the population grew (Greven, 1970).
A group of settlers would petition the General Court of the colony for the legal status of a town and were generally assigned sufficient land for original settlers. Incorporation of a town was initiated by these settlers and was usually £ group action (McManis, 1975). Travel distance to other towns seems to be a primary reason for seeking town status (Swedlund, 1984).
In sum, geographic expansion and the settlement of new towns was related to the- rapid growth of the population and increased outmigration in search of available land. Swedlund (1975, 1984)

and Paynter (1982) have documented the settlement process of towns in the Connecticut River Valley. The present paper investigates these processes in the upland region of north-central Massa"w cnusetts.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Methods of analyzing settlement formation require definition of a study area. Here, all four towns of primary interest in my ongoing research are within 31 kilometers of one another. The geographic center of these four towns was used as a central point for definition of a larger study area. I denned the study area as a circle with a radius of 25 kilometers. Previous studies of migration in historic Massachusetts have shown the majority of migration takes place within this distance (Swedlund, 1971; Norton, 1973; O'Keefe, 1976; Kelly, 1977; Adams and Kasakoff, 1980). This radius also allows direct comparison with results obtained by Swedlund (1975) for the nearby Connecticut River Valley.
The selected study area contained 24 towns by 1850. For each of the 24 towns data were collected regarding year of incorporation, past relationship with other towns, geographic distance from the other towns, and census population size over the time from incorporation to 1850.
Year of incorporation for each town was obtained from Cook (1948), who also lists whether a town was formed from a new settlement or from pieces of adjoining towns. In this manner, I was able to determine the historical interconnections of all towns. Geographic distances (in kilometers) among towns were computed from longitude and latitude using the method of Morton et al. (1968). Population sizes were obtained

from census results for nine time periods: 1765,1776,1790,1800,1810,1820, 1830, 1840, and 1850. Population sizes for the first two time periods were taken from Greene and Harriston (1932), and all later data were taken from standard census reports (United States census, 1791, 1801, 1811, 1821, 1832, 1841, 1854).
Two methods were used for analysis: nearest neighbor analysis and rank size analysis. Nearest neighbor analysis, developed by Clark and Evans (1954), provides a measure of spatial patterning of units in a denned region on a plane surface. For each unit (here towns) in a region the distance to its nearest neighbor, r, is determined, and a mean observed nearest neighbor distance is computed over all n towns. That is,

fA = "Zrln.

(1)

This observed measure is compared with an expected nearest neighbor distance under random conditions. In a region of area A containing n towns the expected mean nearest neighbor distance

fE=l/2-

(2)

The nearest neighbor statistic, R, is then computed as the ratio of the mean observed distance to the mean expected distance. That is,

R = fAlrE.

(3)

The value of R can range from 0 and 2.1491, with a value between 0 and 1indicating clustering of towns, a value of 1 indicating complete random patterning, and a value between 1 and 2.1491 indicating regular spatial patterning. Clark and Evans (1954) have derived the

nearest neighbor distance (R) is high at firstand drops as more towns are added to the analysis. This decrease shows the initial tendency of clustering of settlements. After the seventh town is added to theanalysis, thenearest neighborstatistic shows an increase, reflecting a trend toward regularity in patterning. The values of R aresignificantly nonrandom for allyears after 1762.
These results are similar to those found by Swedlund (1975) and Paynter (1982) in their analyses of settlement formation in the Connecticut RiverValley. The basic pattern of settlement is one of initial clusters giving way to a more regular spatial pattern, as predicted by Hudson's (1969) model of colonization and settlement. Comparison of the present results with those givenby Swedlund (1975) allows assessment of topographic variation, since the region discussed here is upland hills, as opposed to a river valley. Nearest neighbor distances and nearest neighbor statistics

are given for both studies in Table 3, using comparisons based on thenumberof towns incorporated in a region. Since the area isthesame for both studies, the expected nearest neighbor distance is the same for anygiven number oftowns. In all but two cases the present study shows a greater observed nearest neighbor distance than found in theConnecticut River Valley. This difference is significant only for the comparisons involving 21 or more towns. Here, the present study shows a greater nearest neighbor statistic, indicating greater regularity in patterning. Swedlund's study shows greater clustering of towns, most likely reflecting the tendency for towns to concentrate closer to the Connecticut and Deerfield Rivers.
The sequence of town formation is shown in Figures 1-4, which show the geographic location of each town for four time periods. Thesefiguresprovide a graphic supplement to the nearest neighbor analysis. Thefirsttime period,

Overall, these figures show an initial settlement along the southern and eastern range of the study area, followed by westward and northward expansion. Except for the formation of the first towns along small rivers, there doesnot seem to be any correlation of topogra-

This lack of pattern contrasts with Swedlund's (1975, 1984) study of the Connecticut River Valley, where settlements formed initially along the north-south axis of the Connecticut River. Given the higher soil productivity of the valley near the river, such a pattern isnot unexpected.

tion is the fissioning of new towns from old towns, particularly during earlier time periods. In later periods, a number of towns (e.g., numbers 18, 22, 23, 24) form from fusion of two or more towns. This fusion process acts to "fill in" spaces between previously settled towns.
Rank size analysis was performed for the nine census years between 1765 and 1850, and the results are given in Table 4. For each census year the regression slope is less than 1. Thus, the relationship of population size and rank is convex, showing a deviation from a central place hierarchy. Here, large populations are smaller than expected, and small populations are larger than expected. From 1765to 1820the slopes decrease, indicating a trend away from primacy in population size. This trend is most likely due to formation of new towns from old ones, such that the population distribution becomes more even over time. From 1820 to 1850 the slopes increase, as expected when a peripheral area develops cores (Paynter, 1982). Historically, this trend continues, such that today the area has characteristic core populations. From 1765 to 1850,

DISCUSSION
This paper has focused on population growth and settlement formation of north-central Massachusetts in order to provide background for an ongoing study of population structure in four towns in the area. In terms of wider implications, what do such analyses tell us about the genetic structure of populations? As noted earlier, the models we use make frequent assumptions which are addressed best with historical demographic data. In addition to understanding which assumptions are warranted, and under what conditions, an examination of the settlement process can provide insight into potential genetic effects.
The pattern of population growth shown here is typical of much of colonial America, and similar in degree to developing nations today. The primary determinant of rapid population growth in historical Massachusetts was high fertility. Swedlund (1971) detected a high mean and variance in the number of offspring per female in the Connecticut Valley. Preliminary research on the four towns in the present study suggest similar high levels (Relethford, 1986b). In terms of genetic effects, a high mean and variance in fertility will result in a substantial reduction in the effective population size (Crow and Kimura, 1970).
The nearest neighbor analyses provide needed information regarding migration patterns and gene flow. In early years of settlement, nearest neighbor distances were large, suggesting that local migration was limited, and longrange migration contributed more to overall gene flow. Over time, the development of new towns led to a reduction

in nearest neighbor distance. It is interesting to note that in both this study and Swedlund's (1975) the mean nearest neighbor distance decreased to between ^ s i x and seven kilometers. This correspondence points to the fact that the location of new towns depended on travel distance (Swedlund, 1984).
Nearest neighbor analysis can be used to test assumptions regarding migration. An assumption of most spatial models of population structure (e.g., isolation by distance) is that the migration space is homogeneous and that migration is isotropic (Jorde, 1980; Swedlund, 1984). In terms of nearest neighbor analysis, a high value of the nearest neighbor statistics indicates regularity of patterning, and, hence, homogeneity of migration space and a strong likelihood of isotropic migration. In the present paper, the study area develops this pattern quickly, and a strong relationship of gene flow and geographic distance would be expected. The assumptions of geographic population structure models are warranted, at least after the initial stages of settlement.
The sequence of settlement in northcentral Massachusetts also has genetic implications. Settlement formation shows a spread of population from the south and east to the west and north. This spread could produce a cline in gene frequencies, although the entire settlement of the region may have occ u r r e d too quickly to have much of an effect. Clines would most likely be less apparent than in the Connecticut River Valley, where a more noticeable geographic orientation in settlement occurred (Swedlund, 1975,1984).
The historical relationships of the towns has implications for genetic relationships. A basic assumption of most population structure models is that all

populations have a common founding population; that is, all are related by a branching process (Jorde, 1980). In the present study, all populations do not share a single common founding population, but rather some have an independent origin, some fission, and some fuse together. Given the strong relationship of migration and distance shown in other studies of this time and region, it is likely that the relationships among towns parallel the relationships among individuals. That is, nonrandom clusters of gene frequencies can be expected as a result of settlement history.
Based on the history of the study area, a pattern of older towns fissioning and newer towns created by fusion appears to be the basic sequence. Several hypotheses regarding genetic interrelationships can be formulated from this pattern. First, fissioning might be expected to produce unique clusters of gene frequencies due to founder effect, and also due to kin-structured migration (where migration is nonrandom with respect to genealogical relatedness; see Fix, 1978). This seems very likely in the case of colonial Massachussets, given historical evidence that initial settlement was often a group action based on neighborhood and kin ties (Greven, 1970; McManis, 1975). A second hypothesis is that fusion of populations during the later part of settlement formation leads to increased heterogeneity, as a new town is formed from the fringes of other towns.
The rank size analyses show that the study area is a peripheral region and that there are no strong central places from 1700 to 1850. These results relate to assumptions made regarding population size and migration. Models of population structure assume that all populations are of equal size. Even though no

central places existed, population size was not homogeneous throughout the region (chi-square tests are all statistically significant, P<0.05). In an area with characteristic central places such heterogeneity would be even greater. The presence of a central place would also make differential migration likely, since there is often a tendency for larger populations to attract more migrants (Lowe and Moryadas, 1975). In sum, even in the absence of central places it does not seem likely that the assumption of homogeneity in population size and migration is warranted.
CONCLUSIONS
I have attempted to illustrate how some of the methods used by geographers can be used to assess the potential effects of settlement formation and population growth on the genetic structure of populations. Several conclusions may be made from these analyses. The settlement pattern of historical north-central Massachusetts shows a sequence of clustered settlements followed by a random pattern followed by a strong uniform pattern. This sequence confirms Hudson's (1969) model of rural settlement, with a random settlement pattern changing to a uniform pattern as the region moves from the "colonization" stage to the "spread" and "competition" stages. The historical pattern of town fissioning in early years followed by town fusion in later years also fits Hudson's model. During the "spread" stage new settlements formed from older settlements (fission). During the "competition" stage, the spacing of populations reaches equilibrium when portions of older settlements combine to fill in vacant land (fusion).
The present study shows both simi-

larities and differences when compared to Swedlund's (1975) analysis of the Connecticut River Valley. In both studies the nearest neighbor statistics show the same trend over time, in a sequence of clustering to random to uniform. Both studies give results consistent with Hudson's settlement model. The present study indicates a greater tendency toward a uniform settlement pattern in later years. This difference, while small, is significant and does illustrate the demographic impact of small microenvironmental differences (uplands versus river valley). The difference between these regions reflects the greater clustering of communities along the rivers given transportation opportunities and agricultural productivity along a river. In the upland region of northcentral Massachusetts, however, there are no major rivers or other topographic reasons for clustering of populations.
Rank size analysis indicates a temporal pattern in population size hierarchy. There is an increase in homogeneity of population size due to the fissioning of towns. New towns forming from older ones acts to limit the development of larger core populations. After town formation is complete, the region shows a trend toward the development of larger cores and the beginnings of a central place hierarchy. Deviations from population size homogeneity can be expected to have effects on genetic variation of a region. Differences in population sizJ would lead to differences in the expected level of genetic drift. Also, variation in population size can be expected to affect migration rates, and, hence, have an additional effect on geneticvariation. The development of larger core populations is expected to lead to an increase in migration from peripheral populations to the core, but not in re-
