Concerns of the family-planning movement have tended to focus on planning within family units. Studies in advanced countries (Westoff, Potter, and Sagi, 1963; Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson, 1966), however, often reveal that families do achieve, in the aggregate at least, approximately the number of children they say they want. At the same time, many societies and/or social groups within societies produce a relatively large proportion of unwanted births outside of family units.
A concern with limiting populations by limiting unwanted births might therefore focus on out-of-wedlock and premaritally conceived legitimate births. A first step is the acquisition of some specific knowledge in this area. How great is the contribution of illegitimate and premaritally conceived legitimate births to general fertility? How do these contributions differ from one social setting or society to another? National case studies of illegitimacy have revealed very different, patterns of increasing but moderate measures of illegitimacy in England and Wales, very high and rising levels of births out of wedlock in Jamaica, and very low

and decreasing levels of births recorded as illegitimate in Japan (Hartley, 1969a). The detailed study of these three national cases has produced some rather provocative tentative conclusions.
At this time I would like to utilize available data to determine the contributions of illegitimate births and premarital conceptions legitimated before the birth of a child to (1) the crude birth rates, (2) the general fertility rates, and (3) the age-specific fertility rates of these three nations and, where possible, of the United States, as well.
The contribution of illegitimate births to national crude birth rates is shown in Table 1. The nations for which we have data are arranged in rank order of illegitimacy ratios which range from 74.1% to 0.1% of all births reported as out of wedlock. Clearly, the percentage of all births which are reported illegitimate in each country equals the percentage by which crude birth rates would be lowered by an elimination of those births. Most of the countries which report very high proportions of births out of wedlock also report crude birth rates of 40 or more. I have discussed different cultural meanings of "illegitimacy" in some detail elsewhere (Hartley, 1966, 1970a). While a total elimination of illegitimate births is unlikely,

there is a great deal of room for reduction. It may be of interest to note that the rank
ordering of ratios, or percentages of all births which are recorded as illegitimate, follows a rough geographical pattern with the highest ratios concentrated in the Central American and Caribbean countries followed by the South American nations. European nations offer a wide range in ratios within the middle section of rank ordering, and the countries of the Orient and Middle East are lowest in the proportion of all births which are recorded as illegitimate. It is apparent that these ratios are not randomly distributed geographically, nor are they over time.

One may complain that these data are less than perfect. Without doubt, the accuracy varies from one country to another and over time. England and Wales, Jamaica, and Japan have rather well-developed agencies for data collection and publication. Nevertheless, age-specific data for Jamaica are not available later than 1957. The possible sources of inaccuracy have been examined at some length (Hartley, 1966). Let me simply point out here that whatever inadequacies we find are likely to be on the conservative side for our present purposes.
Having seen that births out of wedlock contribute up to 74% of all births, we will examine the more detailed data for England

and Wales, Jamaica, Japan, and the United States. For at least the last thirty years the illegitimacy ratios for the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have been very similar to those of the "mother country," England.

Age-specific illegitimacy rates (the numbers of births out of wedlock per thousand unmarried women at stated ages) for the years specified may be seen in Table 2, Column 3. Although age-specific and general illegitimacy rates for England, Jamaica,

and Japan are very different (Col. 3), the rates for the United States are similar to those for England and Wales. The variations in rates, all of which are based on a thousand unmarried females, indicate that it is not merely a variation in proportions married of all females in the childbearing years that leads to the very different illegitimacy ratios of Table 1, but rather very real differences in the childbearing patterns of those who are not legally married. I have computed (Hartley, 1970a) that with Japanese age-specific illegitimacy rates the unmarried women of Jamaica would produce only 8%, in contrast to over 70%, of all of the births in that country. A very large proportion of unmarried women in the childbearing ages is, therefore, a necessary but not a sufficient condition for high proportions of births out of wedlock.
In focusing on births out of wedlock with a view to their reduction, we need to take note of several relevant features of legitimate births which were premaritally conceived. First, each premaritally conceived birth which is legitimated by marriage before the birth actually occurs reduces the final count of illegitimate births. Second, the numbers of premaritally conceived but legitimate births in relation to the numbers illegitimate give us some idea of the probabilities for various nations or social groups that premarital conceptions will be legitimated by marriage before birth. Finally, these numbers added to the numbers registered illegitimate give us some idea of the potentialities for reduction of births among these presumably unwanted or at least unplanned premarital conceptions. (I will make no assumptions at this time about the estimated numbers of premarital conceptions which end in abortion, either spontaneous or induced.)
Returning to Table 2, Column 4 for Eligland and Wales, we note that in 1967 there were actually more premarital conceptions resulting in legitimate (80,996)

than in illegitimate births (69,588). All measures of illegitimacy--number, general rate, and ratio--would have been at least twice as great without a rather high probability of marriage before the birth of the child. The probability of legitimation has declined somewhat in the years since World War II, from a 6 1 % to a 54% overall probability of legitimation for 1949 and 1967. Even more interesting, the probabilities of legitimation are highly skewed according to the age of mothers (see Table 3).
From these data it is also possible to compute the comparative probabilities that married vs. unmarried women will conceive within the various age groups listed (Hartleys 19696). However, the data from which these computations may be made require detailed record-keeping and publication such as is not uniformly available for many nations of the' world. While Great Britain's Registrar General publishes information on legitimate births by months of marriage and age of mother, we do not have such data for Jamaica and Japan. Nevertheless, we have some fairly strong indications that in neither country are premarital conceptions legitimated by marriage before birth of proportionate importance.

Remembering that the probability of legitimation in England and Wales was highest at the youngest ages, we may examine Column 6 of Table 21 for Jamaica. The percentage of all births registered as illegitimate for the youngest age group was 94.9. Even if all live births to that age group had been premaritally conceived, only 5% of the total could possibly have been legitimated by marriage before birth. It is evident from these and other data that pregnancy is not generally viewed as a reason for marriage in Jamaica. While we have no specific data on premarital conceptions legitimated by marriage before birth, we can, nevertheless, conclude that premarital conceptions overwhelmingly end as births out of wedlock.
Similarily, in the case of Japan, the necessary information on months of marriage at time of childbirth is not available. We do have some indirect information indicating that premarital conceptions legitimated before birth cannot be so often used as an alternative to illegitimacy in Japan as it is in England and Wales. The agespecific legitimate birth rates for Japan are more like the rates for England after removal of births conceived before marriage (Hartley, 1969a, p. 214). A further clue was found in the vital statistics for 1964. In that year only about 4% of all births were recorded to parents married in the same year. With five months being the modal month after marriage for the birth of premaritally conceived offspring (in England and Denmark), we would again conclude that although Column 4 is blank because unknown for Japan as well as Jamaica, the contributions here would have to be slight.
For the United States we do not have complete age-specific data for most of our variables. Estimates on births out of wedlock are based on only 35 reporting states. There are some interesting aspects of those data which are available. First, the prob-

ability of legitimation of a premarital conception is lower here than it is in England and Wales. Furthermore, while we find sizeable differences in illegitimacy rates by color in the United States, we also find a great difference in the probability of legitimation of premarital conceptions, but in the opposite direction. Thus, although nonwhites are far more likely than whites to conceive out of wedlock, whites are far more likely to have such conceptions legitimated by marriage before childbirth than are nonwhites. From estimates made from data for 1960 through 1964 on births within eight months of marriage (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969) and data on first marriages by color for 1964, we can estimate the total number of births within eight months of marriage for 1964. From these it would appear that white women had about a 60% probability of a premarital conception being legitimated before birth while for the nonwhites the probability was only about 17% (Table 4).1
Altogether, births premaritally conceived, legitimate as well as illegitimate at birth, made up about 12% of all births in the United States in 1964.
For England and the United States, therefore, the proportion of births premaritally conceived is considerably larger than the illegitimacy ratio alone would indicate. It would be worthwhile to study the data for other nations as well. For these four countries we conclude that 18% of the births in England and Wales in 1967, 72% of the births in Jamaica in 1957, 1% of the births in Japan in 1964, and about 12% of the births in the United States in 1964 were conceived out of wedlock.
1 Recent data from the National Natality Survey for first births only for the years 1964 through 1966 reported by Mary Grace Kovar at the annual meetings of the Population Association of America, 1970, indicate a slightly higher average probability of legitimation for those years. It is to be expected that the probability of legitimation would be higher for first births. See also U.S. Public Health Service, 1970.

How might the prevention of these births have affected the age-specific and general fertility rates and the crude birth rates of these countries at the dates specified? In Table 5 we may compare the actual rates with the reductions computed by subtracting the premarital conceptions issuing in live births. While the reductions are huge for Jamaica, they are negligible for Japan and moderately large for England and Wales. The reductions are most noticeable for the earliest age-specific categories of mothers. Since we know that the later women begin childbearing the fewer children they are likely to produce, the prevention of births at these early ages might make for a greater long term decline of births than merely the elimination of the premaritally conceived births as such.
Considering the possibilities for reduction of births among only those premaritally conceived, however, we have at least one in five or six births in England and Wales, three out of four in Jamaica, about one in eight in the United States, and only one in a hundred in Japan.
While the numbers and proportions of premaritally conceived births are of major interest to demographers, those interested in social psychology recognize that the human problems involved in these births far exceed their proportional distribution. For this group, evidence indicates that

probabilities are higher than for the population at large that the following four problem areas may result.
First, parental anxiety will be problematic. Seventeen different reports of clinical experience and research (summarized in Pauker, 1969) suggest that unwed mothers exhibit "neurotic symptoms," "depressive reactions," and/or "personality or behavioral inadequacy" or "disturbances." Comparing early high-school records of pregnant and nonpregnant young women, Pauker (1969) concludes that unwed mothers are not "pregnant because they are different" but, rather, "different because they are pregnant." Another important study (Jones et al., 1962) found that "unmarried mothers who kept their babies, in comparison with those who surrendered them, tended to be: (a) lower in intelligence, (b) lower in ego strength or emotional stability, and (c) more submissive."
Secondly, complications of unwanted marriages may follow unwanted pregnancies. Divorce in California (State of California, 1967) is two to three times more likely when a premarital pregnancy is involved than when there is no such impetus to marriage. Christensen's studies (1960) also indicate the greater likelihood of divorce with pregnancy prior to marriage.
Thirdly, abused children may result. It may well be that the most effective way to

prevent battered children is to prevent unwanted births (Heifer and Kempe, 1968).
Fourth, societal support may be necessary. Although by no means all births conceived out of wedlock involve later welfare dependency, the probabilities of dependency are very much higher for this group than for the society at large. For example, 40.4% of illegitimate children under age 7 were estimated to be on AFDC in California in 1970. The corresponding percentage for legitimate children was 13.5% (Berkov, 1970). No doubt our social services need to and will continue to expand. Nevertheless, these always limited services

might be most beneficially focused on raising the human capacities of healthy families as contrasted to patching problems for those persons limited by unwanted births.
Having reviewed the contributions of illegitimate and premaritally conceived legitimate births to the fertility levels of several very different national cases, what may we suggest as possibilities for the reduction of premarital conceptions? It is obvious that some approaches may be theoretically possible but not feasible in time and space. Furthermore, the items to be mentioned are not mutually exclusive, but

may be found to greater or lesser extent coexisting in various countries.
Let us mention in passing the possibility of separating the sexes at puberty. Any real separation within and outside of the school system, as presently occurs in Middle Eastern countries, and any system which reduces the possibility for premarital sexual intercourse would, of course, reduce the possibilities of conception outside of wedlock. The old chaperonage system no doubt limited the opportunities for intimacy.
It is also true that premarital conceptions are impossible wherever the female population is married prior to or at puberty. One of the reasons for the very low illegitimacy possibilities in India and Pakistan (Hartley, 1970a) is the practice of nearly universal and early marriage. While these first two possibilities would certainly restrict conceptions outside of socially sanctioned unions, the probability of instituting the controls necessary in any of the advanced industrialized nations would appear negligible. Rather, it would appear that structural conduciveness, or the opportunity for nonmarital sexual as well as social intercourse, has been increasing.
We may, therefore, look to "self-control" rather than external controls in reducing premarital conceptions. However, reliance on self-control led to present levels of conception outside of wedlock. While abstention from sexual intercourse is the most effective means of limiting conceptions, the "Freudian Ethic" is not likely to be wished away.
On the other side of the coin, it does not seem that we can put our faith in sex education or the easy availability of contraceptives. There should be some controlled studies on the consequences of sex education, but I have not seen any. My own examination of age-specific illegitimacy rates over time for Sweden would indicate that their program of early and complete sex education, including contraceptive informa-

tion, has not led to any decline in births out of wedlock. In fact, in Sweden, age-specific illegitimacy rates increased from 1950-65 for all but older women already beyond the school program. (Sweden, 1950-65).
The increasing knowledge about and availability of contraceptives in themselves are no solution. Although family planners in Jamaica have noted that unmarried women seem even more interested than marrieds in contraceptive information, the translation of expressed interest into active acceptance has been remarkably slow. In fact, the recent increases in illegitimacy measures in England, Jamaica, and the United States have occurred while contraceptive knowledge and availability have increased. Although it has become possible to separate conception from its necessary but not sufficient condition, sexual intercourse, it would appear that the motivation for such has not been adequate.
As Judith Blake Davis (1965) has been suggesting for many years, we need to motivate families to limit procreation. We also need to motivate unmarried individuals to limit procreation, not simply by an appeal to conscience or the welfare of the unborn, but, rather, by presenting "carefully biased options" as Garrett Hardin (1969) would say. From the data on Norway and Germany it would seem that the declines in births out of wedlock in those two countries parallelled an increase in social sanctions on fathers of children born out of wedlock. In Norway the state apparently assigns the father the responsibility of supporting the child to maturity and will attach wages when necessary to collect (Nelson, 1953). In contrast, in England in 1961 only 124 cases of child support were ordered by the courts out of more than 48,000 births out of wedlock. The motivation for prevention of such births must surely be different in the two countries! (United Nations, 1967).
Since we know that contraceptives are
