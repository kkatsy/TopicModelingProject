The International Union for the Scientific Study of Population will hold its nineteenth General Conference in Manila December 9-16,1981, at the invitation of the Government of the Philippines extended through its Commission on Population.
The Scientific Program will have two plenary sessions: Opening Session, Reassessment of Population Trends; Closing Session, From Rome to Manila: How Demography Has Changed in Three Decades.
There will be thirty formal sessions related to the following topics: Fertility: Trends, Determinants and Conse-

quences; Fertility and its Regulation; Nuptiality and Family; Mortality; Migration and Population Distribution; Economic Demography; Data Collection and Methodology; Projections; Specific Issues to the Demography of Particular Groups.
There will be twelve informal sessions on various aspects of the population field. The proceedings will be published after the conference.

Erratum: Louis Munan and Anthea Kelly, "Frequencies of Fatal Congenital Anomalies of the Nervous System: Association with Latitude," Vol. 26, No. 4,1979

In Louis Munan and Anthea Kelly, "Frequencies of Fatal Congenital Anomalies of the Nervous System: Association with Latitude" (Social Biology 26: 335-340), an error in Table 1occurred as a result of Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and the corresponding proba-

bilities beginning in the first column (Latitude) instead of the second. In addition, five of the correlation coefficients should have shown a minus sign. We regret this typographical error and reproduce the corrected table on the following page.
