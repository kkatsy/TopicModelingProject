The present paper is part of a wider sample survey on human fertility in the District of Säo Paulo, Brazil (see Berquó et al., 1968). For this research, the target population was defined as all nonsingle women who in 1965 were between 15 and 49 years old and living in the District of Sâo Paulo. A two-stage, stratified cluster sampling of 3,009 women (0.3% of the estimated target population) was selected and interviewed. All the tables presented concern the 2,857 women who had only one conjugal union.
The data presented are relevant to the marriage patterns of the couples based on two criteria: (1) educational attainment and (2) place of birth and socialization. We will also proceed to analyze the relations between these marriage patterns and the fertility of the couples.
The District of Sâo Paulo has an area of 325.06 square miles. In 1965 its population was estimated at 4,545,862 inhabitants, its crude birth rate was 29.2 per thousand, and its crude death rate, 8.3 per thousand (Berquó et al. 1968, p. 185). Greater Säo Paulo is a highly industrialized region (responsible

for about 50% of the Brazilian industrial production) and, naturally, a very important center of attraction for internal immigration both from rural areas and other urban centers in Brazil.
MARRIAGE PATTERNS BY PLACE OF BIRTH AND SOCIALIZATION OF THE COUPLES
Both wives and husbands have been classified in three identifying categories according to their origin: Rural, Rural-urban, and Urban. These categories have been established through a criterion based on the site of residence of the partners until about 14 years old. The category Rural-urban refers to persons who have lived some length of time (until about 14 years old) in both urban and rural areas.
The similar distribution of men and women appearing in Table 1 indicates that migration to Säo Paulo has been only moderately selective in relation to the sex differential.
It should be mentioned that the gradient Rural, Rural-urban, and Urban considered

Observing the couples from the perspec-
tives of the husbands, we have:
1. Husbands from Rural birth and socialization: 63.6% married to Rural wives, 28.3% married to Urban wives, 8.8% married to Rural-urban wives.
2. Husbands from Rural-urban birth and socialization: 43.8% married to Rural-urban wives, 40.4% married to Urban wives, 15.7% married to Rural wives.
3. Husbands from Urban birth and socialization: 82.7% married to Urban wives, 8.5% married to Rural wives, 8.6% married to Rural-urban wives.

in the sample has in most cases been significantly and consistently related to indicators of social and economic status. In this gradient, the more privileged group is the Urban one, and the less privileged, the Rural one. For this reason we refer to it as "socialization," rather than "residence."
Considering the place of birth and socialization of the partners, we can distinguish between homogamous and heterogamous couples. Of the couples, 74.3% are homogamous, with the following distribution: both partners Rural, 14.5%; both Rural-urban, 4.8%; both Urban, 55.0%. The heterogamous couples are represented by 25.7% of the sample.
From the perspective of the place of birth and socialization of the woman, we find the following distribution.

These patterns of marriage are quite similar for the wives in comparison with their husbands. They do not show any special opportunity or capacity of either men or women to establish a preferential pattern of assortative marriage based on place of birth and socialization. Comparing the random combination of the partners with the observed pattern of marriage, as in Table 2, we can perceive a very clear tendency for assortative marriage.
The frequency relationship shown in Table 2 indicates that for the homogamous

1. Wives from Rural birth and socialization: 66.1% married to Rural husbands, 26.0% married to Urban husbands, 7.8% married to Rural-urban husbands.
2. Wives from Rural-urban birth and socialization: 46.6% married to Urban husbands, 38.5% married to Rural-urban husbands, 14.5% married to Rural husbands.
3. Wives of Urban birth and socialization: 83.6% married to Urban husbands, 9.7% married to Rural husbands, 6.6% married to Rural-urban husbands.

way. We can assume that the set of norms and values predominant in rural areas of Brazil is quite different from those of the urban regions like Sâo Paulo. This divergent set of norms and values influences the ideal size of the family and the reproductive behavior of the population. It is evident that the place of birth and socialization of the women have a correlation with their fertility, but it is interesting to consider that the place of rearing of the husbands is also relevant in the transformation of the patterns of family size.

The educational levels considered in this work correspond to the formal system of education in Brazil. They can be compared approximately to the North American system as is indicated in the stub of Tables 7 through 14.
Tables 7 and 8 show the educational level of the partners. The men's educational level is slightly superior to that of the women. Of the men, 62.6% do not continue their education further than the elementary level; for the women, this percentage is 72.8%. For the medium educational level, these percentages are 27.2% for the men and 25.1% for the women; for superior education, they are 10.2% for the men and 2.1% for the women.
Table 9 indicates that the women tend to

marry men with a superior or at least a similar level of education.
Table 10 indicates the frequency relationship between observed and expected patterns of marriage, showing an assortative pattern of marriage based on the educational achievement of the partners. It indicates a selective pattern of marriage in which certain educational levels of the partners tended to increase the probability of marriage and, conversely, certain educational levels of the partners tended to decrease, to an ever greater extent, the probability of marriage.
Tables 11 and 12 present two cohorts of women, the first including women between 15 and 25 years of age and the second including the women between 40 and 50 years of age. The comparison between these tables shows a general tendency for the younger generation to increase the selective character of the marriage pattern based on educational achievement.
The dissimilarity index applied in Table 13 shows that the younger cohort tends to exclude in a more selective way than the older one, certain patterns of marriage based on educational achievement.
Fertility rates are clearly influenced by the educational levels of the partners, as presented in Table 14.
