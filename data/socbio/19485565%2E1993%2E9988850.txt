ABSTRACT: Consanguineous marriages have decreased significantly (p < 0.01) among the Kamma of Andhra Pradesh over the past forty years. The decline in uncle-niece marriages has contributed heavily to the decline in consanguinity, which may be due to shifting from agriculture to other occupations like government service and the rapid growth of industrialization. More recently, the tendency toward a lower consanguinity rate has been strengthened by reduction in number of children per marriage which reduces the number of eligible cousins. Marriages beyond first cousin have remained more or less constant.

The mating pattern in human populations reflects a functional aspect of social structure and influences the gene pool. Consanguineous marriages, a type of assortative meeting, results in change in gene frequencies. Quantitative data on consanguineous marriages in India were first presented by Sanghvi et al. (1956), after which several attempts were made to present data on inbreeding from different parts of India. The highest values were reported from southern India, especially from the state of Andhra Pradesh (Dronam Raju, 1963; Rao and Inbaraj, 1977; Veeraraju, 1978; Sanghvi, 1966; Rao, 1982; and Govinda Reddy, 1981). In this paper, we examine the frequency of consanguineous marriages and their changes through time in a Mendelian population, the Kamma of Andhra Pradesh.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Kamma, a forward caste whose traditional occupation is agriculture, is

one of the dominant groups of Andhra Pradesh in all socioeconomic factors and belongs to Dravidian stock. They are strictly endogamous, and widow marriage is not permitted among them.
The data were collected from 400 couples in 7 villages spread over three taluks, which are now called revenue mandais of Chittoor District, Andhra Pradesh. For each marriage, a family pedigree was drawn in order to determine the type of consanguinity involved. The year of marriage is noted to determine the trend of consanguinity. The respondents include both husband and wife. Armitage's test (1955) was used to determine the linear trend of consanguinity.
RESULTS
The absolute and percentage frequencies are shown in Table 1. In all, 45.0 per cent of the Kamma were consanguineously married. Among the Kamma, uncle-niece marriage constituted 16.8 per cent, while first-cousin

marriage constituted 19.5 per cent. Marriages with first-cousin-once removed, second cousin, second-cousinonce-removed and third cousin accounted for 8.7 per cent of all marriages. Uncle-niece marriages(16.8 per cent) were more frequent than matrilateral first-cousin marriages (15.0 per cent). Matrilateral cross-cousin marriages were 18 per cent and patrilateral cross-cousin marriages were 10.2 per cent of all such marriages.
The inbreeding coefficient (mean and standard error) is given in Table 2. The sex-linked inbreeding coefficient was higher (0.0422) than the autosomal inbreeding coefficient (0.0353).
The year of marriage of each couple of the sample was noted to determine the trend of consanguineous mar-

riages. The sample was classified into seven groups. Marriages prior to and during 1956 were put into one group, and marriages thereafter were grouped in 5-year periods (Table 3). For the period covering 1956 and earlier, 58.7 per cent of marriages were consanguineous; for 1957-61, 55.0 per cent; for 1962-66, 53.7 per cent; for 196771, 50.8 per cent. Consanguineous marriages were obviously declining. During 1972-76, only 33.3 per cent of marriages were consanguineous. During 1977-81, they increased to 38.5 per cent, but then fell to 30.9 per cent during 1982-86. Armitage's X(i) = 14.9764, X(l) = 2.2063, and overall X2 = 17.1827 (p < 0.01). The x(2> varíate which is clearly nonsignificant shows that there is no departure from a
