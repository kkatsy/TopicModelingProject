ABSTRACT: Genetic variability among seven Chilean Indian populations (Aymara, Atacameño, Diaguita, Pehuenche, Mapuche, Alacaluf, and Yagan) is measured in terms of net codon differences per locus from gene frequency data on seven serologic markers. Indices of cultural and linguistic differences are computed surveying the various ethnographic accounts of these tribal populations. Of the variables, culture, language, geography, and the degree of Caucasoid admixture, only geography seems to be the important factor in explaining the variabilities in genetic distances among these populations. An empirical relationship between geographic distance and gene identity is also established and shown graphically.

The comparative ethnography of South American Indian tribes has been described at length in the multivolume publication called the Handbook of South American Indians (Steward, 1963). On the other hand, studies related to biological diversity as measured by anthropométrie and sérologie traits are scattered, even when they are extensive. Furthermore, only for a few tribes is biological variability related to ethnographic history through a formal analysis (Salzano, 1968; Neel et al., 1972).
In this paper, the genetic diversity among seven Chilean Indian tribes has been studied through an analysis of seven sérologie markers. Since these tribes are known to have admixed with Caucasoids in varying degrees and thereby have gone through a great deal of cultural transformation, the dependence of genetic variability on geographic distance, on the extent of Caucasoid admixture, and on cultural and lin-

guistic dissimilarities is explored through a regression analysis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS The seven Chilean Indian tribes considered for the present analysis are: Aymara (17°S, 70°W), Atacameño (23°S, 67°W), Diaguita (22°30'S, 63°42'W), Pehuenche (38°S, 71°30'W), Mapuche (38° S, 7 2 " 3 0 ^ ) , Alacaluf (50°S, 75°W), and Yagan (55°36'S, 7O°48'W). They all belong to the so-called "highland" Andean populations. Several of these tribes are quite well spread in their geographic habitations, and the latitudes and longitudes shown above are the approximate locations from which the samples were obtained» Furthermore, the Diaguita sample actually comes from northwestern Argentina from which this tribe expanded to Chile during pre-Inca times with an already developed culture (Bennett, 1963; Lothrop, 1963;

Marquez, 1963). During the Inca period, the mitimae system of the Incas disrupted the social organizations of the Chilean Diaguitas. The skeletal remains do not indicate significant differences between the Diaguitas of Chile and Argentina (Stewart and Newman, 1963).
Gene frequencies for seven sérologie markers (ABO, MNSs, Rh, Diego, Duffy, Kell, and haptoglobin) common to all these populations were taken from Etcheverry et al. (1967a and b) and Matson etal. (1966, 1967, 1969). Of these seven systems, only Kell was found to bemonomorphic in all the tribes. The Rh-d gene was almost absent, except in the Aymara and Diaguita samples. The extent of Caucasoid admixture in these tribal samples was computed from the ABO gene frequencies assuming that the ancestral Indian populationsdid not possess either A or B genes. The linguistic and cultural diversities were computed following the general classification of Greenberg (1960) and Driver and Massey (1957), respectively.
INTERPOPULATIONAL VARIABILITIES
Genetic variability.--Genetic variabilities within and between some of these tribes have been analyzed in detail recently (Blanco and Chakraborty, 1975), along with those of several other tribes. However, in the earlier study, Diaguita and Yagan samples were not taken into account, and Pehuenche and Mapuche samples were pooled as the Araucanian complex. Using the gene frequency data on seven systems (ABO, MNSs, Rh, Diego, Duffy, Kell, and Hp), wecomputed the standard genetic distances between the different tribal groups and their standard errors employing methods given by Nei (1972) and Nei and Roychoudhury (1974), respectively (Table 1). The genetic heterogeneity within each population, as measured by the average heterozygosity

comparative studies which is the basis of the cultural dissimilarity matrix shown in Table 1 (lower diagonal entries). Numeric values were assigned to each attribute representing a gradation in the degree of acculturation (e.g., for the attribute "clothing and body ornamentation," the numeric values for the seven tribes are 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0, and 0, respectively, in the order they appear in the table). Absolute differences of these numeric values for each of the attributes were computed, and the sum represents the total cultural dissimilarities between the two tribes concerned. The values were then standardized by dividing each of them by the maximum (which is 39, corresponding to the cultural dissimilarity between the Aymarás and the Yagans).
Cultural descriptions given here, however, refer to the entire group of populations living in South America. Thus, the Aymarás of the cultural classification matrix (Table 2) include the Aymara populations of Chile, Bolivia, and Peru. Local differences in cultural patterns are neglected, although some of them are conspicuous. For example, the Aymarás of the Chilean altiplano do not depend on fish as one of their protein resources because of their geographic location far away from the coast and from the Lake Titicaca Basin which is the habitation of their Bolivian counterparts. Similar changes in fishing habits also occurred in the Atácamenos after they moved inland from coastal areas in the recent past.
Linguistic variability: The linguistic classification of South American Indians as given by Greenberg (1960) consists of a nested hierarchy of family, subfamily, and group. Although this classification does not take into account all the dissimilarities between these seven tribal languages, alternatives are not always acceptable. In other classifications, a given language may be classed in four or five different families by

as many authorities, resulting in rather serious implications for cultural-historical reconstructions (Steward and Faron, 1959, pp. 25-26). In our analysis, linguistic distance is taken as zero if the languages belong to the same group; the unit distance is ascribed to languages belonging to two different groups of the same subfamily; and a distance of three is assigned between languages belonging to two different families. In principle, a distance of two units would correspond to languages belonging to two different subfamilies of the same family. However, such a situation does not arise in these seven languages according to Greenberg's classification (see Llop and Rothhammer, 1974, for a similar analysis of linguistic diversity).
Geographic distance and variations in degree of miscegenation: As mentioned previously, the geographic locations of the seven populations are represented by the latitudes and longitudes of the places from which the samples are drawn. The transformation used to convert these coordinates to a distance matrix in kilometers is somewhat different from Morton's (1969). In our computation, the distance between two locations is represented by
DiS = 2R S i n - ^ i {1 -- Cos Xi Cos Xj Cos (y>i -- y¡) -- SinZíSinxy}]1'2
where R is earth's radius at the equator, (*i> yî) and (XJ, y¡) are latitude-longitude of the locations transformed in radians.
The variation in the degree of Caucasoid admixture is determined only from the ABO blood group. The Caucasoid admixture rates for the seven populations are 4, 5, 17, 5, 7, 6, and 13 per cent, respectively, in the order mentioned earlier (Rothhammer and Llop, 1974). Assuming that these figures are representative of the entire genome, the probability that two genes chosen randomly--one each from Aymara

and Diaguita, for example--will both be of Indian origin is (1 -- 0.04)(1 -- 0.17) =: 0.797. The variation in the degree of admixture is thus studied in terms of these probabilities which vary between 0.722 and 0.912.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION To determine the nature of interrelationships among all the aforementioned measures of variability, we first computed the correlation coefficients between them using all the 21 population comparisons (Table 3). Note that cultural and geographic dis-

ginal amount (10.2 per cent). The result of such a regression analysis is shown in Table 4. This analysis also indicates that of all the variables, only geographic distance seems to be the important factor, explaining the trend in genetic variabilities in these seven Andean populations.
This result is in accordance with the theoretical study of Maruyama (1973). The relationship of genetic distance with the geographic distance is studied further by relating the probability of allelism between two homologous genes with the geographic distance by which two groups are

tances are almost linearly related (r = 0.901). When geographic distance is used as the only regressor to explain genetic variabilities in these seven populations, about 51.3 per cent of the total variance is explained. All the other variables (cultural and linguistic variabilities, and variation in admixture rates) add only a mar-

The least square fit of Ir = 0.973 -f- O.O27e-r/1000 is found to be statistically satisfactory (0.05 < P < 0.1), although a few large deviations from expectations exist toward the tail of the curve. It is worthwhile to mention at this point that an earlier study (Blanco and Chakraborty, 1975) with a similar set of populations also revealed similar results. As mentioned in our earlier study, such a relationship may not hold for populations known to be unstable insofar as their habitats are concerned.
It may be noted that there is also a high association between cultural and genetic variabilities (Table 3) in these seven tribal populations. However, this association may be an artifact of the other two significant values in the same table. Such an association is also exhibited through the regression analysis (Table 4), in the sense that in addition to geographic dis-

tance, cultural differences do not contribute significantly in explaining the variability in genetic distances. The high correlation between culture and geography may also be interpreted from historical evidence since within these populations geographic proximity was the only way of establishing cultural contact in the past. Furthermore, the material culture as described here is not independent of ecological niche, especially because cultural distances are computed from information which includes subsistence.
