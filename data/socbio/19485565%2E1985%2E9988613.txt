ABSTRACT:Selectively bred lines of mice, such as the long sleep (LS) and short sleep (SS), are of potential value for testing hypotheses which attempt to explain the mechanisms that underlie the behavioral actions of alcohol. We have used the LS and SS mice to test several hypotheses, most notably that some of the behavioral actions of alcohol are due to the formation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid, salsolinol, and that alcohol disrupts the activity of specific membrane-bound enzymes. The results obtained support the salsolinol hypothesis and suggest that only some membrane-bound enzymes are affected by alcohol. In view of the fact that the LS and SS mice differ in these parameters, the general hypotheses remain viable despite the fact that the concentrations of salsolinol and alcohol required to elicit measurable effects were large. Therefore, these particular hypotheses can be accepted as being potential explanations for alcohol's actions.

Studies of neurochemical mechanisms associated with the actions of alcohol have been a major theme of research on the etiology of alcoholism. A variety of techniques have been used to gain insight into the interaction of alcohol with various neuronal systems in an attempt to elucidate how such interactions may result in the development of tolerance to and dependence on alcohol. The approach taken in our laboratory has been to combine genetic and neurochemical studies to examine hypotheses of alcohol's actions. We have utilized the long-sleep (LS) and shortsleep (SS) lines of mice developed by McClearn and Kakihana (1981). The LS and SSmice were derived from a genetically heterogeneous stock (HS) by means of bidirectional selective breeding using loss of the righting response

(sleep time) as the selection criterion. The LS mice lose the righting response 10-15 times longer than do SS mice given the same dose of alcohol (Howerton et al., 1984). Thus, these animals represent the extremes possible in response to a challenge dose of alcohol.
The LS and SS mice exhibit modest differences in ethanol elimination (Gilliam and Collins, 1982; Gilliam et al., 1983), but the primary mechanism that underlies the difference in duration of alcohol-induced sleep is differential brain sensitivity to the depressant effects of alcohols (Heston et al., 1974). This genetically determined difference in central nervous system (CNS) sensitivity makes the LS and SS lines of mice useful genetic tools for testing hypotheses concerning the mechanisms of alcohol's action. In this paper, we describe

on alcohol metabolism. These findings support the hypothesis that salsolinol may play a role in eliciting the acute behavioral effects of ethanol.
In an effort to identify the cause of the differential sensitivity to salsohnol seen in the LS and SS mice, we investigated whether the lines differed in the rate of disappearance of salsolinol from brain. The results of this experiment can be seen in Figure 5. The disappearance of salsolinol from brain following IC injection follows first-order reaction ki-

netics. The half-lives were calculated from the first-order kinetic constant and found to be 12.8 min for LS and 12.3min for SS mice. These half-lives are nearly identical to those calculated by Melchior et al. (1980) for the disappearance of salsolinol from rat brain following intraventricular injection. These data argue that the LS-SS difference in response to IC-injected salsolinol is not due to differences in elimination of salsolinol but due to differential CNS sensitivity to the drug.

A number of studies have suggested that drugs which affect behavior do so by altering the concentration, release, reuptake, or turnover of the neurotransmitter amines, norepinephrine and dopamine. The high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay used to measure salsolinol elimination from brain allowed us to monitor concurrently the brain levels of norepinephrine and dopamine following salsolinol injection. This was of interest because of reports suggesting that salsolinol increases the release of these amines (Smolen et al., 1984). Both alcohol and salsolinol

interact with neurotransmitter systems in a highly complex manner. Many of the behavioral effects produced by these drugs could be attributable to alternations in catecholamine systems (Church et al., 1977; Awazi and Guldber, 1979). Salsolinol, however, did not affect whole brain levels of dopamine in either mouse line, and only a modest reduction in norepinephrine levels was detected in LS mice 20 min after salsolinol treatment. Further studies are necessary to assess the importance of this finding. The measurement of whole brain catecholamine content provides, at best, a

take, the concentrations required are outside the physiological range (0.25-- 1.0 per cent). The observations that very high concentrations of ethanol were required to inhibit dopamine uptake and that the LS and SS were affected similarly argue that ethanol does not elicit its behavioral effects by altering the reuptake of dopamine unless some metabolite of ethanol alters dopamine uptake in vivo.
In similar in vitro experiments, eight concentrations of salsolinol ranging

from 1micromolar to 3 millimolar were evaluated for their ability to inhibit dopamine uptake (see Fig. 7). Dopamine uptake was significantly inhibited by salsolinol. Furthermore, a three-fold difference between the LS and SS mice was seen in their IC50 values (that concentration which inhibits the uptake by 50 per cent). This finding suggests that the difference in behavioral response to salsolinol between the LS and SS mice may be due to differences in the effects of this agent on dopamine uptake. How-

ever, the effects of salsolinol on dopamine uptake were seen only at very high concentrations. Therefore, unless salsolinol affects dopamine uptake at lower concentrations in vivo, the hypothesis that salsolinol elicits its behavioral effects by inhibiting dopamine uptake must be accepted with caution.
In summary, the results of these experiments are supportive of a role for salsolinol in the actions of alcohol, although the nature of the role is as yet undetermined. Nevertheless, studies of salsolinol's actions may provide some

insight into the mechanisms by which alcohol exerts its effects.
ALCOHOL-MEMBRANE INTERACTIONS
Of all the hypotheses concerning the mechanism of alcohol's actions, that which has gained the widest acceptance is the belief that alcohol exerts its pharmacological effects by disrupting cell membranes and thereby altering membrane function. This is not a new concept; in the early 1900's Overton (1901)

All of these methods have been used to show that alcohol disorders or increases the fluidity of the membrane lipids, a phenomenon believed to be a primary mechanism by which alcohol elicits its effects.

In addition, Goldstein's group has demonstrated that membranes obtained from SS mice are fluidized less by alcohol than are LS membranes and that this difference is not easily explained by differences in membrane lipids (Goldstein et al., 1982). Thus, an argument can be made that alcohol exerts its effects by altering

membrane fluidity and that differences in behavioral response to alcohol may be correlated with these alterations.
While there is considerable support for the hypothesis that alcohol exerts its effects on the brain (and consequently behavior) by altering the fluidity of membranes, our knowledge of precisely which membrane-mediated processes are affected is rudimentary. We do not know, for example, if alcohol affects the activity of all membrane-bound enzymes or only some; i.e., is there any specificity in alcohol's action? One way in which the effects of alcohol on activity

of membrane-bound enzymes can be studied is to assess its effects on lipid phase transitions. Lipids can exist in the membrane bilayers as fluids or as gels. Cell membranes are a mixture of fluid and solid phases at physiological temperatures. As temperature changes, the relative proportion of the phases will shift. This shift may affect the functioning of the proteins in that membranebound enzymes may function differently above and below the transition temperature. Thiswould be expected if the fluidity of the membrane was important to enzyme function. The phase transition

ase is the most sensitive to ouabain inhibition, the high K¡ enzyme is less sensitive, and Mg-ATPase is insensitive to ouabain. The low K¡ enzyme has been largely ignored in the past. However, the fact that it may be found exclusively in neuronal tissues (Marks and Seeds, 1978; Sweadner, 1979) suggests that it may be the most important of the three ATPases.
In order to study the effects of alcohol on phase transition in the lipid core of the membrane, enzyme activity was measured as a function of temperature in the presence or absence of alcohol. Arrhenius plots of these data are presented in Figures 8,9,10,11, and 12. In

these figures, a break in the slope of the line represents a change in lipid phase. For both AChE (Fig. 8) and 5 nucleotidase (Fig. 9), the transition temperatures were not significantly altered by alcohol. Mg-ATPase (Fig. 10) showed no transition and does not appear to be affected by alcohol. No significant differences were detected between the LS and SS mice with respect to these three enzymes. Similarly, the two lines of mice do not differ with respect to the high K¡ Na-K ATPase (Figs. 11 and 12): The presence of alcohol did not change the transition temperature of this enzyme in either line.

ouabain-inhibitable NaK-ATPases were measured at 10 temperatures in the absence (·) or presence

(O) of 0.66 M ethanol with the differential assay. Each point represents the mean ± the standard error of

cohol has on reducing the transition temperature of the low K¡ Na-K ÀTPase (see Figs. 11 and 12). Alcohol reduced the transition temperature 7°Cin the LS line compared to 4°C in the SS line. The magnitude of this difference agrees almost perfectly with previous reports by Goldstein's group on LS and SS differences in order parameters (Goldstein et al., 1982). These data suggest that alcohol does have specificity in its actions since, of the five enzymes studied, only the low K¡ Na-K ATPase was uniquely affected. Further studies of the effects of alcohol on this membrane-bound enzyme may provide information concern-

ing the mechanisms by which alcohol disrupts membrane function and thereby alters behavior.
In summary, our data support the hypotheses that alteration of the activity of the low K¡ Na-K ATPase is involved in the behavioral effects elicited by an acute dose of alcohol. This effect probably involves a disruption of the interactions between the lipids surrounding the enzyme, and the enzyme protein. The fact that only one of the five enzymes studied was differentially affected by ethanol indicates that a better understanding of the effects of ethanol on membranes will be obtained only by

Nonetheless, the results obtained with these systems provide some encouragement and suggest that further experiments may provide data that will be of value in understanding the mechanisms by which alcohol elicits its acute behavioral effects.
