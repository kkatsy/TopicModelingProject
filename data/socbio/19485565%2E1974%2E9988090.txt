Religion has long been recognized as an important influence on fertility. A report based on the Princeton Fertility Study (Westoff et al., 1963), for example, found religious preference to be a better predictor than all other major social variables of a couple's fertility.
In light of the demonstrated importance of this variable in fertility research, it becomes important to note that a substantial body of literature on religion in America today has documented a trend toward "secularization" in American life and has pointed to the erosion of traditional religious beliefs and influence in certain denominations (for example, Glock and Stark, 1965).
In an attempt to investigate this secularization phenomenon with regard to influence on fertility, Judith Blake (1966) examined the "Americanization" of Catholic reproductive ideals. Blake used statements and publications of the Catholic clergy to demonstrate what this group considered the ideal number of children for their membership. Then, comparing the stated fertility ideals of Catholics to the clergy's ideal and to the ideals of other

Americans, Blake concluded that the fertility ideals of Catholics were really more like those held by other Americans than like the reproductive ideals of the Catholic clergy.
This analysis is important for students of fertility, and of religion as well. Unfortunately, it has not been applied to other religious groups. Further, it would seem that such an analysis would be strengthened if behavioral measures could be substituted for the attitudinal measures used by Blake. It is possible that members of religious groups may express ideals at variance with those of their religious leaders but eventually behave in accordance with the norms set by the church.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints, or Mormon church, is another religious group, like Catholics, with a high fertility tradition. The state of Utah, site of the church headquarters and with 71.3 per cent of its population claimed as members by the Mormon church,1 had the

was considered important since they were faced with a frontier existence where much human labor was required in order to survive.
Secondly, the practice of polygamy contributed to high fertility. During the early days of the church, "statements against polygamous marriages or favoring fertility limitation were treated as synonymous" (Hastings et al., 1972, p. 20).

This injunction is but one aspect of the theological reasoning. Mormons accept the belief of the pre-existence of spirits and during the temporal existence "the faithful Mormon shares the sacred responsibility of offering these spirits the best possible hope for progress toward perfectibility and exaltation, experienced in a mortal state by membership in a 'good' Mormon family" (Hastings et al., 1972, p. 21).

2 United States and Utah birth rates for 1970 are provisional and were obtained from "Monthly Vital Statistics Report," Annual Summary for the United States, 1971.

With such a belief system, it is not surprising that birth control is frowned upon, and according to Ezra Taft Benson (1969a,

p. 12), a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles:3
The world teaches birth control. Tragically, many of our sisters subscribe to its pills and practices when they could easily provide earthly tabernacles for more of our Father's children. We know that every spirit assigned to this earth will come, whether through us or someone else. There are couples in the Church who think they are getting along just fine with their limited families but who will someday suffer the pains of remorse when they meet the spirits that might have been part of their posterity.
Further, the emphasis on family life among Mormons is quite strong. Benson (19696, p. 21) has said:
It has been truly stated that "salvation is a family affair . . . and that the family unit is the most important organization in time or in eternity."
The Church was created in large measure to help the family, and long after the Church has performed its mission, the celestial patriarchal order will still be functioning. This is why President Joseph F. Smith said: "To be a successful father or a successful mother is greater than to be a successful general or a successful statesman . . . ," and President McKay added: "When one puts business or pleasure above his home, he, that moment, starts on the downgrade to soul weakness."
Oftentimes, David O. McKay, (1969, p. 9), late church President, has spoken on the sacredness and the purpose of marriage and family.
Marriage is a sacred relationship entered into for purposes that are well recognized-- primarily for the rearing of a family . . . . Teaching the young of both sexes in the responsibilities and ideals of marriage so that they may realize that marriage involves obligation and is not an arrangement to be terminated at pleasure. Teach them that pure love between the sexes is one of the noblest things on earth, and the bearing

and rearing of children the highest of all human duties.
In addition, there is a general admonition against the use of birth control devices. In 1969, the President of the church, David O. McKay, wrote:
We seriously regret that there should exist a sentiment or feeling among all members of the Church to curtail the birth of their children. We have been commanded to multiply and replenish the earth that we may have joy and rejoicing in our posterity.
Where husband and wife enjoy health and vigor and are free from impurities that would be entailed upon their posterity, it is contrary to the teachings of the Church artificially to curtail or prevent the birth of children. We believe that those who practice birth control will reap disappointment by and by.
However, we feel that men must be considerate of their wives who bear the greater responsibility not only of bearing children, but of caring for them through childhood. To this end the mother's health and strength should be conserved and the husband's consideration for his wife is his first duty, and_ self-control a dominant factor in all their relationships.4
The historical and theological bases, strengthened by the emphasis on family life, thus provide strong supports for Mormon couples to maintain high levels of fertility. However, the definition of what constitutes sufficient fertility for the good Mormon couple is not explicitly stated.
On one occasion, President McKay noted (Hastings et al., 1972, p. 22):
Marriage is for the purpose of rearing a family, and now is the time to do it. I admire those young mothers with four or five children around them now, still young and happy.
At another time, however, we find Melvin J. Ballard, a Mormon apostle, say-

3The church hierarchy is headed by a President who is also considered a Prophet, Seer, and Revelator. The Quorum of the Twelve Apostles is a high level advisory group. Traditionally, the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles has become the new Prophet-Seer-Revelator upon the death of the church President.

4 This letter dated April 14, 1969, was addressed to presidents of stakes, bishops of wards and presidents of missions. According to Hastings, et al. (1972, p. 25), "instructions to local officials accompanying this epistle were to use personal discretion in offering advice to members."

ing to a mother after the birth of her eighth child (Hastings et al., 1972, p. 24):

Lord: . . . Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them . . . ."

Now Sister . . . we must preserve our strength to care for our children. It isn't expected that we should bring children in to the world at the detriment of our health, such that we can't care for the ones we already have.

If an ideal number of children is not explicit, the admonition for consistently high fertility is made quite clear.
MORMON FERTILITY

The leaders of the Mormon church are not expected to practice celibacy as are the clergy of the Catholic church. Since no clear, ideal family size emerged from the writings of church leaders, it was felt that an examination of the number of children bora to the church Presidents might indicate some pattern. Four men served as church President from 1920 to 1970. They were, in order, Heber J. Grant (S children), George Albert Smith (3 children), David 0. McKay (7 children), and Joseph Fielding Smith (11 children).6 Again, no clear guideline is given.
The ideal number of children for the "good" Mormon family is thus obscure and apparently should vary in the eyes of the church leaders with emotional and physical circumstances. However, these circumstances apparently should not include such secular considerations as economics, preferred lifestyles, or political events. According to Elder Ezra Taft Benson (1969a, p. 12):

In the face of such strong religious supports for high fertility, what are Mormons actually doing in comparison to other Americans? Since the required number of children is not clear, how is this injunction to have many children translated by the Mormon couple? We turn to an examination of Mormon crude birth rates between 1920 and 1970 in order to answer this question.
The data on Mormon fertility were obtained from the Historical Department of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The crude birth rates include worldwide church membership, and information is not currently available which separates these rates for the United States population only. However, the majority of the Mormon membership outside the United States is found in developed nations with a Western tradition.
The Mormon birth rates are computed from membership rolls. Membership records are made when a child is blessed (0-1 years) or when a convert is baptized

The first commandment given to man was to multiply and replenish the earth with children. That commandment has never been altered, modified, or cancelled. The Lord did not say to multiply and replenish the earth if it is convenient, or if you are wealthy, or after you have gotten your schooling, or when there is peace on earth, or until you have four children. The Bible says, "lo, children are an heritage of the

(age 12 or over). If an infant dies before being blessed, a membership record is automatically filed unless one of the parents is non-Mormon and objects to having the child placed on the membership rolls.
The church population as of December 31, 1967 (Table 1) was 2,615,744. However, the data on distribution of these

Eighty-one per cent of the Mormon church membership in 1967resided inthe United States. Of the United States membership, 38.4per cent was found in Utah. The vast majority of all United States Mormons (83.7 per cent) are located in the Western United States, with the top ten states in membership totals being Utah, California, Idaho, Arizona, Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Texas, Colorado, and Wyoming.
It is recognized that crude birth rates do not take into account different age distributions of populations, thus limiting their usefulness in comparative studies. Nevertheless, they are used here due to lack of age-specific fertility data for the Mormon population.
Table 2 provides the crude birth rates for Mormons, Utah residents, and the United States population at five-year intervals from 1920to 1970.
It is clear that Mormons have had higher birth rates throughout this period

total membership figures was obtained during a personal interview on May 19, 1971 with Mr. Charles Kleinman, Presiding Bishoprics' Office, Membership Department, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City, Utah.

than either Utah residents or the population of the United States. While this ordering of the three populations with regard to the level of the birth rates was to be expected, the very great similarity in the pattern of the birth rate among the three populations is rather striking. These data are presented graphically in Figure 1.
All three populations show a decline in the birth rate from 1920 through the Depression. In 1935, the rate started to go up once again, with a sharp increase during the post-World War II "baby boom."
This upward trend peaked for all three populations in the mid-1950's. There was then a rapid drop in the birth rates until 196S, at which time both the Mormon and Utah birth rates increased. The United

States birth rate continued to decline, but at a slower rate. This latter period represents the "baby boom" babies coming into the childbearing ages, a phenomenon which would have a greater impact on the crude birth rate among the younger Mormon population than among the United States population as a whole.
Through all of these increases and declines, the difference in the Mormon and United States birth rates has been remarkably stable. In 1920, this difference was 10.3, and in 1970 it was 10.2. The difference in these two birth rates was greatest in 1950 and least in 1925.
