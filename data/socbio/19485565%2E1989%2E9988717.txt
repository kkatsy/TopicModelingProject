Ethnicity, Sibling, and Family Correlates of Young Adults' Status Attainment: A Follow-Up Study
Kevin Marjoribanks
Vice-Chancellor University of Adelaide Adelaide, Australia
ABSTRACT:Longitudinal data were used to examine relationships among sibling variables, perceptions of family environments, and measures of educational attainment, occupational status, and occupational aspirations. The analyses involved 21-year-old Australians from AngloAustralian, Greek, and Southern Italian families. Regression surfaces were plotted from models that included terms to test for possible linear, interaction, and curvilinear associations among the variables. The study indicated that sibsize and birth order continued to have many significant associations with young adults' status attainment even after taking into account the mediating influence of perceived family environments. Also, the investigation suggested that there are ethnic-group differences in relations among sibling variables, perceived parents' support for learning, and young adults' status attainment.

that examine associations between sibling variables and outcomes such as occupational status.
Moreover, the study was designed to examine the admixture model of sibling relations. The model suggests that the significant relationships found in many sibling investigations may be an artifact of the pooling of social groups (see Page and Grandon, 1979; Laosa, 1984; Valencia et al., 1985). It is proposed, therefore, that analyses of sibling correlates of individuals' attributes should be conducted within different subpopulations such as ethnic groups. In this longitudinal study, relationships were examined among sibling variables, perceived parents' support for learning, and statusattainment measures, for young adults from different Australian ethnic groups.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The sample included 180 AngloAustralian, 88 Greek, and 72 Southern Italian young adults. When the subjects were 11-years-old, birth order and sibsize data were collected during parent interviews, for an analysis of the sibling correlates of children's academic achievement (Marjoribanks, 1981). From those interviews, families were classified as Greek or Southern Italian if both parents had migrated to Australia before or just after the birth of their 11year-old child and if Greek or Italian was the language typically spoken in their respective homes. In AngloAustralian families both parents were born in either Australia or England, and English was the only language spoken in the home.
In a follow-up analysis, five years later, a structured questionnaire was used to gather data about the 16-year-

olds' perceptions of their parents' educational and occupational aspirations for them, the encouragement they received from their parents for staying on at school, and their parents' general interest in their education. From the responses, two factor scales, each of eight items, were constructed. The environment dimensions were labeled as adolescents' perceptions of their fathers' and mothers' support for learning, and they had theta reliability estimates greater than 0.75.
In the final collection of data the subjects were 21 years old, and measures were obtained of their educational and occupational attainments as well as their occupational aspirations. A 7-point scale was used to construct educational attainment scores while occupational attainment was coded using a prestigerating index that ranks approximately 300 occupations in the Australian context (Broom et al., 1980). Occupational aspirations were measured by the same scale that was used to gauge occupational attainment.
RESULTS
Because of the relatively limited sample size in each ethnic group for undertaking multivariate analyses, the data were not examined separately for females and males, which is a restriction of the study. Also,findingsfrom the investigation need to be interpreted within the limitation that the sample was not random. Throughout the analyses, however, adjustments were made for the design effects of the sample. Significance levels were adjusted using the formula: standard error of sample estimate = (design effect) m x simple random sample standard error (Ross, 1987).

In Table 1 the results show the zeroorder correlations between the sibling and family environment variables and the status-attainment measures. In each ethnic group the perceived family environment measures had moderate to strong associations with the outcome variables. Sibsize was related to the status-attainment measures in Southern Italian families but not for AngloAustralian and Greek. In contrast, birth order had significant associations with each outcome measure for Greeks and Southern Italians and with occupational aspirations in the Anglo-Australians.
When the significance of group differences was examined, sibsize was more strongly related to educational attainment in the Southern Italians than in the other two groups. Also, sibsize was more strongly associated with occupational aspirations for Southern Italians than for Anglo-Australians, while birth order was more strongly related to educational attainment for Greeks than for Anglo-Australians. The relations between perceptions of mothers' support and occupational aspirations were significantly stronger for Greeks than for Southern Italians. These initial results provided tentative support for the proposition that there were group differ-, ences in the relationships between the predictor and outcome measures.
Zero-order correlations provide only a limited understanding of the covariate structure of variables. Relations among the measures in each ethnic group were investigated further by plotting regression surfaces that were generated from hierarchical regression models. In the models, product terms were included to test for possible interaction effects among the variables while squared terms were added to examine for possible curvilinear associations. That is, the

models were of the form: Z = aX + bY + cXY + dx2 + eY2 + constant, where Z, X, and Y represented measures of the young adults' outcomes, sibling variables, and perceptions of parents' support for learning, respectively. If the addition of interaction or squared terms was not associated with a significant increment in the amount of variance in outcome scores, then the terms were deleted from the particular model.
When interaction and curvilinear terms make a significant contribution to the variation in dependent measures, it is necessary to interpret with caution the regression weights in the resulting full regression model. Once such higher order terms are added to a regression model, the coefficients of linear forms of the related variables become unstable. In Table 2, therefore, if interaction or curvilinear terms were significant, then only the regression weights associated with those variables are designated as being statistically significant. The implication is, of course, that the related linear term was significant before the addition of the higher order term and that its continued significance is reflected in the addition of the associated later term. Also, in order to reduce multicollinearity in the regression models, each variable was transformed by subtracting means from the raw scores of the relevant measures.
In Table 2 the results show that, in each ethnic group, the sibling and family environment variables combined to have moderate to strong associations with the outcome measures. The raw regression weights also indicate the possible complexity of relationships among the variables with the presence of significant curvilinear relations in a number of the regression models. In three of the

models, the sibling impact on outcomes was mediated by the addition of the family environment measures. These relations involved sibsize, fathers' support, and Southern Italians' educational attainment; birth order, fathers' support, and occupational aspirations in the Anglo-Australian group; and birth order, mothers' support, and AngloAustralians' occupational aspirations. In nearly half of the models, however, the sibling variables continued to have significant associations with the outcome measures after the addition of the family perception measures.
In the Marjoribanks (1985) study the results indicated that sibling variables continued to have some significant associations with adolescents' perceptions of their parents' support for learning, even after taking into account the impact of earlier environment variables. There was, for example, a significant negative relationship between sibsize and fathers' support, holding constant social status, for Anglo-Australians. Also, there was a statistically significant negative association between sibsize and mothers' support, holding constant social status, for Greek Australians. It needs to be emphasized, therefore, that the presentfindingsin Table 2 represent only the direct effects of the sibling variables, holding constant either fathers' or mothers' support. That is, the total effect of the sibling variables on status attainment also includes an indirect effect of the sibling measures on status outcomes through their effects on adolescents' perceptions of parents' support for learning.
From the regression weights shown in Table 2, regression surfaces were plotted to explore further the nature of group variations in the relationships

size, perceptions of fathers' support, and the young adults' occupational aspirations. The shapes of the surface for Anglo-Australian and Greek young adults indicate that sibsize was not related significantly to aspirations. In contrast, at each sibsize level, perceived fathers' support had moderate to strong associations with aspirations. Across the range of fathers' support scores, for example, there were regression-fitted increments of 9 and 20 points in aspirations for Anglo-Australian and Greek young adults, respectively. For Southern Italians, sibsize had a curvilinear association with occupational aspirations. Successive increases in sibsize were associated with increased decrements in occupational aspirations, at each value of perceived fathers' support.
DISCUSSION
The present analysis has indicated that sibsize and birth order continued to have many significant associations with young adults' status attainment after taking into account the mediating influence of family perception measures. Also, the study suggested that there are ethnic-group differences in relations among sibling variables, perceived parents' support for learning, and status attainment. That is, by using longitudinal data, refined family environment varia-

bles, and regression surface analysis, the investigation has provided support for the proposition of Blake (1985, 1986) and Mare and Chen (1986) that sibling variables need to be incorporated into research and theory building about social stratification.
Much of the family environment research that is undertaken concentrates on an examination of between-family factors. As McCall (1983) suggests, such factors might be expected to influence all children in a family approximately to the same extent. There is a need in family research, however, to consider in greater detail those environmental factors such as sibling variables and perceptions of parents' support that might, in their effects on outcomes, be specific to individuals. This present study has built upon the earlier investigation by Marjoribanks (1985) and has revealed the importance of examining such withinfamily environment factors for a more complete understanding of differences in status-attainment outcomes. Also, the investigation has supported the admixture model which suggests that analyses of sibling relationships should be undertaken within different subpopulations. It is likely, therefore, that our understanding of sibling influences will be enhanced by further investigations that include other within-family environment measures for individuals from different social groups.
