Travel Update: XIV International Congress of Genetics, Moscow, 1978

The Genetics Society of America has appointed Travel Service, Inc., 2ISO Shattuck Ave., Berkeley, Calif. 94704 to assist with travel arrangements, including visas, for U.S. and Canadian delegates to the XIV International Congress of Genetics in Moscow in August. All arrangements for travel in the U.S.S.R. must be made in advance through Intourist, the U.S.S.R. Company for Foreign Travel, and making such arrangements, including obtaining required visas, can be quite complicated. It is therefore strongly recommended that all persons planning to travel from the United States or Canada to Moscow make their travel arrangements through Travel Service, Inc., which is serving as the U.S. Coordination Center for the Congress.
Plans now include two low-cost charters, one from New York City ($664) and one from Chicago ($742), leaving August 19 and returning August 31. Both are round trips and represent a substantial

savings for the individual traveler. (All rates quoted are subject to reconfirmation at time of booking and/or payment.)
Arrangements in Moscow are under the auspices of Intourist. They will include hotel accommodations, breakfast and lunch daily, transfers on arrival and departure, transfers between hotel and Congress site, and excursions in and around Moscow at an estimated cost of $30.80 to $43.40 per person, double occupancy, d c pending on category confirmed.
Specially organized GSA Tours include touring Scandinavia (Aug. 12-Sept. 2) and Eastern Europe (Aug. 15-Sept. 5) in conjunction with the Congress. Post-Congress Interior Russia Tours as offered by Intourist are also available.
Because of the involved process of registration and reservations, it is imperative that persons planning to attend the Congress contact Travel Service, Inc., immediately.
