Introduction of medical assistance usually produces a fast increase in previously constant population sizes. In small communities, intensive birth control and emigration may reverse the process in very few years. Throughout these demographic changes, genetic kinship may be expected to vary suddenly with changes in population size and migration. We have tried to measure the possible fluctuation of genetic kinship, using two settlements in Eastern Greenland as a practical example.
Information about the history, ethnography, demography, and genealogies of East Greenlanders since their discovery have been collected by R. Gessain (1969) in Ammassalik and J. Robert (1970) in the Scoresby Sund district. The unusual history of these populations allows a biological analysis of the observed and expected consequences of a population explosion followed by the sudden adoption of birth control in a small community.
We will summarize what is known about population size and migration in Eastern Greenland, first during the nineteenth century and earlier and then during the twentieth century. For our study, we will use deterministic simulations of the

evolution of kinship to isolate the possible effect of changes in population size and migration pattern, without consideration of the breeding structure which is assumed to be panmictic. Some parameters are unmeasurable or too small to be estimated. Extreme and medium population estimates are considered according to the information available.
HISTORY OF THE POPULATION
NINETEENTH CENTURY
The first contact with inhabitants of Eastern Greenland was made in 1823 by an Englishman named Clavering who found 12 Eskimos living in a tent at 74° N. These Eskimos were probably summer migrants, part of a population close to a demographic minimum due to ecological hazards. No Eskimo was ever seen again at this latitude, but some of them may have reached the settlement of Ammassalik nine degrees to the south. Oral tradition has it that immigrants came to Ammassalik from the north some 150-200 years ago.
During Graah's Eonebat Expedition in 1832, the population of Southeastern Greenland between Cape Farewell and

65° N. was estimated at 480. However, by 1883-84, only 135 were counted in a census of the area by G. Holm, a Dane. These were people who had not yet migrated south, attracted by the European goods available on the western coast. By the end of the nineteenth century, the southeastern coast was uninhabited. A few people had moved to the north to Ammassalik and these immigrants can be traced in our genealogies of the present population.
It was not until 1884 that the first European contact was made with the Ammassalimiut (people living in Ammassalik). G. Holm found 413 people living along three great fiords and on several islands between 6S°30' and 66°30' N. The 413 Ammassalimiut of whom Holm made a census in 1884-85 were a reduced population. We know that several families had died of starvation in 1882-83. Since whole families perished, this loss would not have changed the age structure of the population (43 per cent of the population 15 years old or younger). Before this disaster, there were probably 480 to 500 people living in Ammassalik. This number is rather high for Eskimo hunters, but it is in keeping with the technology and hunting possibilities in the area at that time. It may be postulated that the prehistoric population fluctuated between four-hundred and five-hundred individuals.
PREHISTORIC PAST
Before the nineteenth century, our only information on populations in the area comes from interesting but incomplete archaeological data. The first known immigrants came from the western coast of Greenland via the south in the fourteenth century. Since the Vikings had been settled on the southwestern coast for some four hundred years, it is possible that admixture had occurred prior to the time of

immigration. Technological changes reflected in the archaeological data seem to indicate that other small immigrations along the same route took place in the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries. These and earlier immigrants, all coming from the south, seem to have reached Scoresby Sund and perhaps even farther north. While we may conclude that Ammassalik was largely populated by immigrants from the south, it is certain that some Eskimo did reach the eastern coast via the north.
Although lacking direct archaeological proof, we may posit that Dorset culture (around 400 A.D.) was present in Ammassalik. It is difficult to determine whether or not there has been continuity from these ancient Arctic hunters to the present, but it seems that Dorset traditions have lived on since the first centuries of the Christian era on the eastern coast.
At present, no relation can be established between the musk-oxen hunters of Northern Greenland two- to four-thousand years ago and the coastal Eskimo whose presence was attested much later.
TWENTIETH CENTURY
Since the time of discovery, the detailed demographic history of the population of Eastern Greenland is known through Danish religious and civil registration records and through the reconstruction and analysis done by R. Gessain (1969), J. Robert (1970, 1971), and P. Robbe.
The salient facts for our study of Ammassalik and Scoresby Sund are the following: (1) The Scoresby Sund District was established in 1925 and was comprised of 70 individuals. (2) There was a striking increase in the Eastern Greenland population of some five-hundred per cent (see Figure 1) due to the extraordinarily efficient medical care provided by the Danes. (3) The population experienced an admix-

ture of West Greenlandic genes at the start and later of European genes. Some 2 to 3 per cent of the population, mainly children, are of mixed blood at the present time. (4) Birth control measures have been introduced in the last few years. Their effect has not yet been measured, except in Scoresby Sund. (S) Until now, first-cousin marriages have been prohibited by tradition.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Utilizing the available data, we have calculated for different time periods the effective population size, systematic pressure, and migration matrix.
PREHISTORIC PAST
For the prehistoric period, we estimated effective population sizes on the basis of the Ammassalik population size of 413 at the time of discovery in 1884. Since there were at that time 182 individuals of re-

productive age, we have taken 200 as our effective population size since we know that some people had died or left shortly before the census. We will also consider two extreme estimates of effective population size, 130 and 300. The first figure corresponds to the one-third of the census population normally used as effective population size. However, we know this figure to be an underestimate as there was a lowered proportion of old people in the population due to the custom of the elderly committing suicide when they were no longer able to follow the community. The second number was chosen because it seemed the maximum figure compatible with the ecology at that time.
Since only one population is being considered, the migration matrix is 1. The systematic pressure is difficult to determine with any accuracy. We have calculated values corresponding roughly to 2, 4, and 10 immigrants per generation, the last figure certainly being much too high.

HISTORICAL PERIOD
The evolution of the effective population sizes is shown in Figure 1 for both Ammassalik and Scoresby Sund. I t has been taken as equal to the number of married people able to reproduce. The migration matrix has been taken as equal to 1 before the creation of Scoresby Sund, then equal to the average migration matrix for both settlements during the historical period. The systematic pressure has been taken to equal, the mean long-range migration rate per generation. For the living population, we counted one for the West Greenland settlers, one-half for people having one parent born outside of Eastern Greenland, and one-fourth for those having one grandparent born outside. Averaging the values for one generation, we took 0.02 (partly ascertained) for Ammassalik and 0.10S (calculated) for Scoresby Sund. In part one of the simulation, trials with three different values for the initial kinship measured by Malecot's q> were performed. These values are 0.035, which is considered likely, and 0.02 and 0.04, both of which seem extreme.
THE FUTURE
Since no official decision about a population policy for Eastern Greenland has yet been made, it is possible that there will be a continuing expansion of the population as in the sixties. However, this possibility seems unlikely considering the economic situation, the direction of governmental population policies, and the introduction of birth control in the last few years.
I t is more likely that local population sizes will be regulated by emigration and birth control, particularly in the Ammassalik population. Such regulation would presumably result in a constant, economically self-supporting population on the eastern coast of Greenland. Curiously

enough, certain considerations lead us to believe that the size of this optimum population would lie in the same range as the size of the prehistoric Eskimo population.
For our study, we hypothesized that the effective population size would increase exponentially until 1984, when those people born after the introduction of contraception will begin to marry and reproduce. Later, the effective population sizes would be reduced in one generation to the ascertained optimum of 175 in Ammassalik and 35 in Scoresby Sund. We have assumed that the migration rates and systematic pressures would remain constant. The arbitrariness of these hypotheses is expressed by the parentheses in the tables and the dotted line in Figure 1»
METHOD
We used the NUMIX and OBELIX computer programs (D. Harris, 1969) which perform a deterministic simulation of the evolution of genetic kinship using the following parameters: the initial kinship matrix; the vectors of effective population sizes in the successive generations; the vector of linearized systematic pressures; and the migration matrix.
The NUMIX program computes the evolution of kinship between two finite populations i and ; of effective population sizes Ni and N¡ in a set of n populations.
At the first generation (t = 1),
where m is the linearized systematic pressure due to mutation, selection, and longrange migration and Pu the probability among individuals reproducing in i of having been born in k.

The OBELIX computer program performs the same simulation as NUMIX but allows different systematic pressures in the n populations.
The systematic pressures and migration matrix are supposed constant in the program available now. This hypothesis is, of course, hazardous, but since the populations are small these parameters are random variables whose fluctuations may be meaningless.

Table 2 leads us to think that the initial kinship in Ammassalik should·*lië~be"£wëën 0.02 and 0.04, the most likely values being around 0.032-0.035. The values of 0.016 and 0.05 were obtained by using estimates that are barely defensible according to what we know of actual conditions at the time of discovery. The values in parentheses can virtually be discounted since they correspond to a number of generations much higher than possibly ever lived in the area.
HISTORICAL PAST AND THE FUTURE
Results are given in Table 3, corresponding respectively to the three hypotheses 0.02, 0.035 and 0.04 about initial kinship.
The most striking fact seems to be that, as the population increases, opposite effects on the effective population sizes and on the migration rates tend to stabilize the level of kinship, even in a period of exponential growth as between 1884 and 1970 in Ammassalik.
The situation is somewhat different at the origin of Scoresby Sund where the initial population was very small, but the joint higher systematic pressure and population increase seems to have held down the rising of the kinship coefficient.
It can also be seen that the long-term effect of a birth control policy would be to stabilize the kinship coefficients close to their present level rather than to disturb significantly their values.
Kinship between both settlements decreases slowly (about one-third in four generations) before reaching a migration equilibrium.
The equilibrium values and number of generations before convergence have no meaning as predictions, but constitute a good description of the genetic significance of the present demographic data.
