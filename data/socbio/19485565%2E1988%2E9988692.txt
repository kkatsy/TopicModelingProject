ABSTRACT: 224 subjects from 5 different racial/ethnic groups responded to a dating questionnaire. There are both sex and racial/ethnic differences in frequency of cross-ethnic dating in Hawaii and in attitudes (as reported by Ss) of parents and close friends toward withinand across-ethnic dating. Females date within their own groups more frequently than males and also report stronger support of within- and lesser support of across-group dating by significant others. Racial/ethnic differences are substantial, with groups higher in mean income being more supportive of within-group dating, being more accepted by other groups, and being less accepting of dating other groups. Amount of actual intergroup dating was related, in part, to group differences in income, with the two groups lowest in income (Filipinos and Hawaiians/Part Hawaiians) showing the highest amount of cross-ethnic dating, but with the association breaking down in the upper income groups, possibly because of group differences in group size and in length of residence. The results are remarkably similar to those reported earlier on within- and across-group marriage in Hawaii.

outmarriage. Other variables also influence outmarriage rates. The per cent of outmarriage is lower in first marriages than in later marriages (Jedlicka, 1975) and in higher than in lower occupational groups (Schmitt, 1971). If outmarriage occurs, the probability of members of a given group marrying a member of any other group is substantially influenced by group income. Persons who outmarry marry into groups with mean incomes similar to their own. This tendency is somewhat stronger for females than for males (Johnson, 1984). The most recent income data, for 1979 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1983), shows the following mean family incomes in Hawaii: Caucasian, $26,557; Chinese, $32,388; Filipino, $22,921; Hawaiian/ Part Hawaiian, $22,166; Japanese, $31,994.
Personality factors also influence marital choice. Women who outmarry differ substantially from women who marry within their own group. Adjective Check List (Gough and Heilbrun, 1965) data for women who married two or more decades ago showed them to be significantly higher in dominance, exhibitionism, autonomy, and aggression and lower in abasement and deference. Men who married across vs. within groups differed a good deal less. Adjective Check List data showed them to be lower in endurance and in orderliness. This data set (Ahern et al., 1981) also showed that the less the proportion of outmarriage, within given sex and ethnic groups, the greater the difference between those who married across vs. within racial/ethnic groups. Basically, only unusual persons did unusual things. The Ahern et al. data set was based on data acquired from persons whose average age was in the mid-40's, and who provided the data over a decade ago.

Since outmarriage has increased substantially over time, personality, differences between those who marry across vs. within racial/ethnic groups might be expected to have decreased.1
The present report has to do with dating, not marriage; but dating is a prelude to marriage and patterns of within- or across-group dating should be predictive, to a degree, of marriage patterns. A person who dates only members of his or her own group might be expected to be less likely to marry across groups than a person who often dated members of other groups.
Our purposes, in the present paper, are to assess (1) the dating patterns of males and of females from a variety of racial ethnic groups, (2) the daters' judgments of how their family and close friends would regard their dating of members of their own and of each of the other four major groups, and (3) the association of group income with the dating patterns of group members and with the acceptability of group members to persons of other groups.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects were recruited from various undergraduate psychology courses. Their sex and ethnicity is described in Table 1.
The proportion of persons in different racial/ethnic groups closely approximates their proportional representation in the general student body. The
1 All of the subjects assessed in the present report were administered the Comrey Personality Scales (Comrey, 1970). The association of dating behavior with scores in the eight construct and two validity scales of the Comrey was ascertained for males and females separately. Only one of the twenty correlations (more extroverted females cross-ethnically more often) was significant.

roughly 2:1 sex ratio of females to males is that which is found in enrollments in most psychology courses. We also obtained dating information from subjects from other racial/ethnic groups (e.g., Koreans) but numbers were too small for meaningful analysis, and from persons of mixed racial/ethnic background, which had to be discarded because income data are unavailable. Therefore, our presentation of data is limited to the five major racial/ethnic groups listed in Table 1.
Subjects provided demographic data, including age, sex, ethnicity, birth order, and sibship size. Subjects were asked whether they dated only members of their own racial/ethnic group, mostly members of their own racial/ethnic group, about 50/50, mostly members of other racial/ethnic groups, or only members of other racial/ethnic groups. They then were asked whether their parents and close friends would feel positive, neutral, or negative with regard to their dating members of each of the other racial/ethnic groups.
RESULTS
As will be reported below, there are sex differences, both in the attitudes of family and friends toward out-group dating and in actual dating practices. Therefore, despite the small numbers, for some groups when divided by sex, it is necessary to report our data sepa-

rately for the two sexes. Reported dating practices are presented in Table 2.
When males and females are divided into 3 groups (date only or mostly own group; 50/50; date mostly or only other groups.) a l 2 of 13.93 2 df, (P < 0.001), indicates a higher amount of crossethnic dating for males than for females.
Reported attitudes of family and close friends toward dating members of each S's own group and toward members of the other four groups were scored as follows: positive = 1; neutral = 2; negative = 3. Mean reported attitudes of the families and friends of S's of each group toward dating are presented in Table 3.
Males and females of each of thefive ethnic groups reported the attitudes of family and friends toward dating members of each of four other groups. Males reported more favorable attitudes toward intergroup dating on the part of significant others in sixteen of the twenty comparisons, and report significant others to be less supportive of within-group dating in 4 of 5 comparisons. In all, the males report significant others to be more accepting of intergroup dating and less supportive of within-group dating in 20 of 25 comparisons. A binomial test (Siegel, 1956, pp. 36-42) shows this differences between the sexes in reported attitudes to be significant (p < 0.01).

favorable attitudes to be more frequent than unfavorable attitudes (z = 2.37; p<0.05). Subjects believe that their family and friends are far more often positive than negative in their attitudes toward other groups. Further, 117 of the 224 Ss (52.23 per cent) date members of ethnic groups other than their own 50 per cent of the time or more, while only 29 of the 224 (12.95 per cent) date only members of their own group. In general, then there is very little feeling against intergroup dating, and intergroup dating is very common.
There are differences in positiveness within this positive atmosphere. There usually is more negative feeling on the part of significant others regarding intergroup dating and more positive feeling regarding within-group dating reported by females than by males, and females do, in fact, date members of other groups less often than do males. As Table 3 indicates, some ethnic groups are regarded more positively than are others by S's families and friends. Some groups are more accepting in general of other groups than others. Table 4 indicates that group acceptability both in its own eyes and in the eyes of others ispositively associated with mean group income. The degree of positiveness expressed by members of each group toward other groups is negatively associated with income, and the higher one's own group income the less acceptable the other groups are. These dating data are highly similar to marriage data (Johnson, 1984) which showed that persons tended to outmarry into groups similar to their own in income, and the greater the discrepancy in group income, the less probable the intermarriage of persons from different racial/ ethnic groups.

Actual intergroup dating is not as closely related to income as are reported attitudes. Persons of Filipino and of Hawaiian/Part Hawaiian ancestry are lowest in income; subjects from these groups report that their significant others are less supportive of within-group dating and more accepting of across group-dating, and also report a high degree of across-group dating. The three higher income groups, persons of Chinese, Japanese, and Caucasian ancestry, do not show the same comparability between income and dating patterns. Chinese, who report the lowest degree of acceptance of other groups by family and friends, are intermediate in actual dating. This result is similar to that reported for marriage data (Johnson, 1984). Parents and significant others of Chinese young men and women may be opposed to both intergroup dating and marriage, but still have little influence on dating and marriage patterns merely because of the small percentage of Chinese. No matter what attitudes exist, 19 of every 20 potential spouses of Chinese young men and women are from groups other than Chinese. Caucasians are relatively accepting of others, but are low in intergroup dating. This probably is a consequence of relatively recent residence in Hawaii (33 of the 41 Caucasians, as compared with only 25 of the 183 members from the other four groups reported residing on the U.S. mainland for 6 or more years). The low crossethnic dating of Caucasians again parallels the comparatively low rate of intergroup marriage of Caucasians (especially Caucasian females) found in marriage data (Johnson, 1984).
The present data indicate that crossethnic dating is well accepted in Hawaii and occurs with substantial frequency

Cross-ethnic dating is accepted by 5's significant others differentially across sex and ethnic groups. Ethnic differences are closely associated with ethnic differences in mean income level. Despite very small numbers in some sex-

x ethnic group combinations, the results, as noted above, show a remarkably close similarity to previously reported data having to do with within- vs. across-ethnic group marriage in Hawaii.
