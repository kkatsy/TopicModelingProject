C. Herb Ward, Ph.D., President of the American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS) and Professor of Biology and Environmental Sciences at Rice University, has announced the implementation of a long-term facilities development plan for the Institute. Effective April 22, 1985, the Institute's headquarters are located at 730 Eleventh Street, N. W., Washington, DC 20001-4584. With this move, AIBS becomes the prime occupant of an office building, which will be dedicated to a variety of programs in the life sciences.
In commenting on the relocation, President Ward noted that "the new facility fulfills a goal set less than a year ago by the Board of directors to purchase a building in the Washington, D.C. area to support current operations and provide for future growth. We now have the opportunity to greatly enhance our program of national meetings organized and hosted by the Institute. We will also bring significant long-term stability to our housing costs and thus be able to devote more of our resources to programs of benefit to the biology profession." As Chairman of the 1984 Long Range Planning Committee, Ward developed the feasibility and justification for obtaining permanent housing. Since its founding in 1947, the Institute has occupied a number of leased quarters, shifting its location every ten years in response to changing market conditions.
The new quarters will enable AIBS to expand the scope and variety of the

services it offers to federal agencies, other national associations in the life sciences and its several dozen member societies and research laboratories. In particular, there are three separate meeting rooms in the building.
The facility provides about 25 per cent more operating space than AIBS currently uses. Under the development plan submitted to the D.C. Government, the added space would be available to expand Institute programs and activities and to provide operating space for member societies who wish to establish a Washington office. These member societies would share the benefits of the long-term budget stability which this venture represents to the Institute as well as have access to a complete range of administrative support services.
Founded in 1947, AIBS is a federation of some 40 professional societies and research laboratories representing more than 70,000 biological scientists. It is devoted to the advancement of the biological, medical, agricultural and environmental sciences and their applications to human welfare. It also fosters and encourages research and education in the biological sciences. Its governmental relations and publications activities are focal points for national interests in bioscience, and it serves such diverse government bodies as the Agency for International Development, the Department of Energy, and NASA, the space agency.
