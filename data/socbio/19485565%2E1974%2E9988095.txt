Advanced Study Program in International Nutrition Planning

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology International Nutrition Planning Program, in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Engineering Study, will initiate in September, 1974, a special ninemonth Advanced Study Program for Fellows in International Nutrition Planning.
The program is designed primarily for officials of governments and international agencies who are involved in or likely to become involved in the planning, implementation, or evaluation of programs designed to combat malnutrition in low income countries.
A small number of persons will be accepted each year for this nondegree program and will undertake a program designed to supplement existing talents

and experience, whether in public health, finance and economics, or administration. Among potentially relevant subjects are development economics, human nutrition, quantitative methods and data analysis, health services administration, and regionoriented political development. The program is limited to individuals able to meet certain entrance requirements, including fluency in English, and who are sponsored by their respective organizations or governments and can demonstrate that they have adequate financial support.
For further information on the program, write: Dr. John O. Field, Advanced Study Program, International Nutrition Planning Program, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 30 Wadsworth St. (ES3-46S), Cambridge, Mass. 02139.
