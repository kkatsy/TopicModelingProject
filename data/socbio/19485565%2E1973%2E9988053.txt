A Biometrical Genetic Approach to Intelligence and Schizophrenia

D. W. Fulker
Department of Psychology University of Birmingham Birmingham, England

Recently, the psychogenetics group at Birmingham University has been considering the problem of applying biometrical genetics to the behavior of man. While these methods had proved their worth when applied to the behavior of animals (Broadhurst, 1960; Broadhurst and Jinks, 1961, 1966; Fulker, Wilcock, and Broadhurst, 1972), the work of Cattell, one of the pioneers of human psychogenetics, suggested that the same clear-cut results could not be expected with humans (Cattell, 1957, 1965). A preliminary investigation at Birmingham resulted in the development of an appropriate methodology and a reanalysis of existing data, the outcome of which suggested that biometrical genetics could be applied to the analysis of human behavior with far greater ease than was previously thought (Jinks and Fulker, 1970).
It is the purpose of the present paper to give a brief account of this approach and its underlying assumptions and to illustrate its use by applying it to the genetics of intelligence and schizophrenia. The application to intelligence follows closely the analysis given in Jinks and Fulker (1970). Although a statistically superior and more direct method was used, the outcome was essentially the same. The analysis of schizo-

phrenia represents a novel application of the approach.
The biometrical genetic approach, as developed originally by Fisher (1918), involves partitioning the total observed variance of a trait into components reflecting the effects of an indefinite number of both genes and environmental influences. If we are concerned with human behavioral traits, the least number of effects required to be at all realistic is five. On the genetic side, we must allow for the effects of additive and dominant gene action and that of assortative mating, while on the environmental side we must allow for the effects of a common family or shared environment, as well as those environmental effects unique to the individual.
In order to separate these components, a number of different types of biological and social family groupings--such as pairs of siblings reared together and apart and monozygotic twins--must be used. Variances and covariances, or correlations, derived from these groups reflect to different extents the genetic and environmental influences responsible for individual differences in the population. Although it is preferable for technical reasons to work with variances and covariances, the model

can be illustrated most effectively in terms of correlations. The expectations of the correlations obtained from several types of families can be seen in Table 1. The correlations shown are those obtained by Burt for IQ and are based on over 1,600 British school children (Burt and Howard, 1956; Burt, 1966). The test used with the children was a reliable group test standardized against Burt's revision of the Terman-Binet, augmented by further individual testing where results were at variance with teachers' assessments.
The composition of the correlations are shown in columns four to seven. For monozygotic twins reared together, for example, the correlation reflects four of the five components of the model. The fifth component, the unique effects of environment, which does not appear in the expectations in the table, is given by 1 -- r. With r = 0.92 we can see that only 8% of variance is due to this source. The expectation of monozygotic twins reared apart is the same, apart from the effects of a common family or shared environment. For dizygotic twins and siblings reared together, the expectations are identical: half the additive variance, a quarter of the dominance variance, all the assortative mating variance and, of course, the effects of common environment. The expectations for the other groups are shown in the rest of the table.
To estimate the parameters in this model, an approximate maximum likelihood method was used which took into account the different amounts of information available for each statistic, the information being inversely related to the square of the standard errors shown in column three of the table.
The estimates obtained are shown at the foot of the table; 59% of variance is additive, 13% is due to dominance, 11% to assortative mating, and only 9% due to common environment, this leaving 8% for the unique effects of environment. However,

the expected correlations in column 8 based on these estimates, although in general matching the observed correlations rather well, indicate one discrepant statistic, that for unrelated individuals reared together. The X23 of 6.3 for the failure of fit of the model is not quite significant at the 5% level, but a much better fit is obtained by dropping this group from the analysis, which reduces the %2to 0.28 and gives the estimates in the bottom row. The two sets of estimates are quite similar, however, since the correlation for the unrelated children reared together carries relatively little weight in the analysis, its standard error being relatively large. It is a powerful advantage of the maximum likelihood estimation procedure that it simultaneously gives reliable estimates and a means of assessing the adequacy of the model.
The significantly better fit obtained by dropping the correlation for unrelated children reared together indicates this statistic is biased and suggests a failure of one of the assumptions underlying the simple model shown in the table. Consequently, before going on to use the genetic components to estimate the level and direction of dominance and the number of genes controlling IQ, we must examine the validity of the underlying assumptions.
These assumptions fall into three groups. The first assumption is that the components appropriate for any one group are also appropriate for the others, that is, that the sampling of genotypes and environments has been essentially at random and that the model is equally applicable to all groups. The simplest way to test this assumption is to examine the means and variances of the groups for homogeneity. Using analysis of variance to test the homogeneity of means, together with tests for homogeneity of variance, has enabled us to select for phenotypes such as neurotidsm' and extroversion reasonably homogeneous groups for

analysis and to reject groups which were inadequately sampled or biased (Jinks and Fulker, 1970). With Burt's data, a thorough investigation of sampling is not possible since he did not give all the required statistics. However, those means and variances he did give suggest that the groups differed very little from each other and were reasonably homogeneous (Burt, 1956, 1966).
A further test of the equality of components between the groups is provided by the maximum likelihood model fitting procedure itself, which, as we saw, suggested rejecting the correlation for unrelated children reared together as inconsistent with the rest. Burt also regarded this correlation as suspect, suggesting that selective placement had operated to make it spuriously high. In the case of the monozygotic twins reared apart, however, Burt was able to show that selective placement, at least with respect to socioeconomic status, had probably not occurred since the correlation between biological and adoptive parents was essentially zero. The consistency of the correlations remaining after rejecting that for unrelated children reared together, which includes this unbiased correlation for monozygotic twins apart, suggests that the correlation for siblings reared apart is unbiased too.
A second assumption, and one which is not tested very throughly by the model fitting procedure, is that of no interaction between genetic and environmental effects. However, this assumption may be tested quite simply by looking for differential stability of environmental effects among the pairs of monozygotic twins reared apart. Just as genotype-environment interaction in animal populations can be detected as heterogeneity of environmental variance in different isogenic groups, so, because each pair of twins is isogenic, the differences between members of a pair should be homo-

geneous if there is no genotype-environment interaction (Jinks and Fulker, 1970).
The environmental differences for the S3 pairs of monozygotic twins reared apart were compared with the genotypic values for each pair, as indicated by the twin pair sums, both by means of scatter diagrams and by means of linear and non-linear correlations, and there was no evidence of interactions for IQ (Jinks and Fulker, 1970; Eaves, 1970). This finding has recently been confirmed by Jensen (1970) using data from four studies of monozygotic twins reared apart. However, by means of further tests, based on this rationale, evidence of considerable genotype-environment interaction has been found for a number of personality traits (Eaves, 1970); but, as far as IQ is concerned, there seems very little evidence of this kind of interaction.
The third assumption underlying the simple model is that there is no correlation between genetic and environmental effects, an assumption many psychologists find quite unacceptable for many behavioral traits and particularly for IQ. For example, if a parent with high IQ provides an environment that promotes the development of high IQ, then he provides his offspring with both favorable genes and favorable environments. This situation would lead to the shared genes and shared environments of siblings being positively correlated producing an apparent increase in genetic variance. It was the possibility of this and other kinds of correlations between genetic and environmental influences that led Cattell to develop MAVA, his multiple abstract variance analysis (Cattell, 1965) which implies that simple biometrical models would fail.
Fortunately, we can detect this kind of effect by comparing the variance of groups reared together with those reared apart, where an inflation of variance will not occur. In Burt's data, the variances of monozygotic twins reared apart and full sibs to-

gether were almost identical, the F ratio for 105 and 527 df being only 1.04, which strongly suggests that a correlated effect is not operating. This finding may seem surprising until we consider how much care was taken, through the retesting of children in the case of doubtful results, to prevent this kind of bias from occurring in Burt's data. Further, the relative unimportance of shared environments for IQ means that even if this bias is present, it can only have a fairly small effect.
Having some faith, then, in the validity of the estimates of the genetic and environmental components, we may find that they may be used to indicate something of the "genetic architecture" (a term used by Mather [19S3] to refer to a detailed description of the genetic system) of IQ.
The top part of Table 2 gives the expec-

dominance component also reduces to a simple expression when u = v. If we have equal gene frequencies, the square root of twice the dominance component divided by the additive component indicates the average level of dominance (see Table 3). The component for assortative mating reflects a fraction of the additive variance dependent on A, the correlation of additive effects between parents, which in turn reflects the genetic component in assortative mating.
Three other statistics can help us to interpret these components. These are the overall third moment, k3, the average within-family third moment, ks, and the extent of inbreeding depression, measured as the difference between the means of an outbred and an inbred group (Mo -- Mt). The third moment k3 is a complex function of unequal gene frequencies (u -- v) and

tations of the genetic components of Fisher's model in terms of individual gene effects. The notation is that developed by Mather (Mather, 1949; Mather and Jinks, 1971) who greatly extended Fisher's original model. The additive component reflects gene frequencies, u and v, and both homozygous effects, d, and heterozygous or dominance effects, h. Only when u = v (col. 3) does the component reduce to an expression in terms of homozygous effects only. The

However, k.i is free of the effects of unequal gene frequencies and may always be used to detect directional dominance providing the distribution of environmental effects is not skewed. The absence of genotype-environment interaction suggests normality of distribution for the effects of the environment, and Jensen (1970) has recently convincingly demonstrated this to be the

quendes. Since both methods underestimate the number of loci, we can see that very many genes must be involved in controlling individual differences in IQ.
The genetic architecture indicated by this analysis suggests that high IQ has been associated with a high level of reproductive fitness and strong directional selection during man's evolutionary history which in turn supports the idea that IQ is a biologically valid measure of intelligence.

allow us to infer about IQ. The average within-family third moment calculated from 700 sibling families is significantly negative, indicating dominance for high IQ. A small, though highly significant, inbreeding depression for cousin marriages confirms that dominance is for high IQ. The ratio of ks to ks suggests that, on the average, the gene frequencies are equal, which in turn allows us to estimate the level of dominance from the additive and dominance components of variance as 0.73, a figure compatible with complete dominance, and to estimate the number of loci as about 22. The inbreeding data indicate about 100 genes; this is an estimate not dependent on equal gene fre-

The heritability appropriate for prediction of IQ in offspring--the so-called "narrow" heritability--is obtained as the sum of the variance due to additive gene action and assortative mating, taken as a fraction of the total variation (Jinks and Fulker, 1970) that is 0.70 or 70%. It is interesting that this figure predicts fairly accurately the frequency of subnormality in the offspring of both one and two subnormal parents given by Reed and Reed (1965). They arbitrally define subnormality in their population as an IQ less than 69. On this definition, the offspring of two subnormal parents were found to be 39% subnormals. Using the expression for response to selec-

tion and normal probability tables leads to a predicted frequency of 38%. Where only one parent is subnormal and the other unspecified, the observed frequency drops to 16% and the predicted frequency, allowing now for the effects of assortative mating, is 17%. While some error is likely to result from the use of normal probability tables when we know IQ does not conform precisely to a normal distribution, the error is likely to be small and the predictions are strikingly good. These predictions suggest, as Reed and Reed argue, that a great deal of subnormality is due to the polygenic nature of IQ.
Turning from a clear-cut and straightforward analysis for IQ, I will indicate what a polygenic model for schizophrenia suggests regarding gene action. However, the analysis is presented as a possible approach and the results should, at best, be regarded as suggestive only.

Harvald and Hauge's (196S) and Tienari's (1963) samples were obtained from state records of twin births in Denmark and Finland respectively while Kringlen's (1966) sample was obtained from state records of both twins and psychotics kept in Norway. Of the 178 twins in Table 4 given as dizygotic in Kringlen's study, there are six same-sex twins of unknown zygosity. These six twins had zero concordance for schizophrenia and have been included in the dizygotic group to avoid omitting any of the twins identified by the sampling procedure. The majority of them are expected to be dizygotic and it seems likely they all were. In any case, inclusion or exclusion makes very little

formation about the effects of the common family environment. Heston's (1966) data are based on a follow-up study of the children of 47 schizophrenic mothers confined to a state hospital in Oregon and those of Rosenthal et al. (1968) are derived from adoption registers in Denmark. The concordance of 3/54 given in Table 4 was estimated from the tables in their paper and may be slightly in error because of doubt concerning the diagnosis of parents who had died prior to the study. The maximum possible effect of this error could only lower the concordance from 7.92% to about 7.70%, which in turn would have the effect of improving the fit of the genetic model suggested. Any error was therefore judged to be of trivial importance.
The concordance rates in Table 4 are simple pair concordances based on fairly clear-cut cases of schizophrenia. Age corrections have not been made because age of onset is correlated in relatives leading to overestimates of concordances when any simple correction procedure is adopted. As a result, age effects are probably confounded to some extent with those of the environment. Bias from this source is not expected to be large since Kringlen's data, which are for all practical purposes free of age bias, are homogeneous with the other three sets of twin data.
Heterogeneity chi-square tests suggest

that samples within each of the three groups are sufficiently homogeneous to be pooled for the present purpose and a tetrachoric correlation was calculated for each. This correlation was based on a population incidence (p) for schizophrenia of 1.14%, the value found by Kringlen for his twins and very close to that suggested by numerous other studies (Slater and Cowie 1971).
The procedure of calculating a tetrachoric correlation assumes a continuous normal distribution of liability to schizophrenia with a threshold for the expression of the disease, a model which has been suggested by Gottesman and Shields (1967). The basic model was developed in a rigorous manner by Falconer (196S) who has applied it to the inheritance of a number of diseases (Falconer, 1967). An interesting account has also been provided by Edwards (1969) who gives a simple approximate formula, developed by Penrose, for estimating the tetrachoric correlation. The correlations and their standard errors given in Table 4 were calculated using this formula in the manner suggested by Edwards.
Table 5 presents a simple genetical model fitted to the tetrachoric correlations, a model that omits the effects of assortative mating since on a strict threshold model no substantial effect can occur. Data on assortative mating (Erlenmyer-Kimling and Paradowski, 1966) suggests a 2% con-

If schizophrenia is under the control of few genes, it is not surprising that present analytical methods are unable to distinguish between single gene and polygenic models, a fact noted by Elston and Campbell (1970).

The outcome of this analysis appears to be satisfactory, but both the data and the model require further support. The concordances used can be disputed, depending on the definition of schizophrenia and the method of computing concordance, and age effects have to some extent been ignored.
