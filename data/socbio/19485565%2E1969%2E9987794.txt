Two presumed effects of the oral contraceptive are its potentiality for enhancing the marital sexual relationship and, paradoxically, its potentiality for increasing fertility. Women frequently attribute improved or increased marital relations to the reduction of anxiety about undesired pregnancy. Many also believe that the pill makes them physiologically more capable of conceiving after they discontinue it; indeed, the treatment of sterility with the use of progesterones was an important impetus to the development of the contraceptive. The scientific evidence1 is very mixed and inconclusive both because of the methodological problems in measuring these effects and the inadequacies of research designs and types of samples that have been used.
Two recent sample survey studies of fertility in the United States have collected data relevant to these questions. These studies, although not focused primarily on these questions, represent a distinct improvement over most of the small clinical studies providing the bulk of current evidence. We will discuss first the relation of the pill to the frequency of marital relations.
1 For recent reviews of the scientific literature on these effects, see Wallach and Garcia, 1967,1968.

THE PILL AND COITAL FREQUENCY
Although it is possible that the various side effects of the pill are common enough to decrease sexual activity, the opposite point of view is usually suggested in the literature on this subject.2 There are several reasons why the adoption of this modern method might result in a significant increase in marital sexual activity: (1) The reduction of anxiety about pregnancy removes a potentially serious impairment of coital activity. (2) The physical separation of contraception from the sexual act may increase spontaneity and enjoyment. (3) The biochemical action of the progesterone component of the pill may increase female libido.
The evidence thus far assembled on this question has been inconclusive, either because of small or unrepresentative samples or because of various methodological limitations complicating the analysis, such as the absence of "before" and "after" measurement or the lack of an adequate control group.
The evidence that we can contribute to

this subject comes as a by-product of two large-scale sample survey studies of human fertility, the main objectives of which are to understand the social factors affecting reproduction. Most of the information (collected through interviews) in these studies concerns fertility, fecundity, and contraceptive and fertility-planning histories. Our data concerning sexual behavior are derived from single questions addressed to the wife on the frequency of coitus with her husband during a recent period of time. From the demographic perspective, the chief interest in such matters has been the relationship between coital frequency and the chance of conception and, to a lesser extent, the study of the acceptability of different contraceptive methods, one component of which is the frequency of coitus and other aspects of sexual behavior.
Although the research objectives of the two studies are essentially similar, they differ in research design in ways important for our present interest. The principal difference is that one, the so-called Princeton Fertility Study (PFS), is based on a longitudinal design in which women were interviewed first in 1957, six months after the birth of their second child, reinterviewed in 1960, and reinterviewed again toward the end of their reproductive period (between 1963 and 1967). The other study, known as the 1965 National Fertility Study (NFS), was a cross-sectional one-time survey of a sample of married women at all stages of childbearing. Both studies were based on probability samples of married women living with their husbands although the PFS was confined to an initial sample of 1,165 couples living in seven of the largest metropolitan areas of the United States, whereas the NFS was designed as a national sample of some 5,600 women.3
behavior, our report is confined to married couples exclusively since our data were collected as a byproduct of studies of marital fertility.

RELIABILITY OF MEASUREMENT
Our analysis begins with some findings based on the larger national sample of the NFS and concludes with data from the PFS, exploiting that study's advantage of permitting "before" and "after" measurements of coital frequency. But first a comment is appropriate on the reliability of measurement of coital frequency. The question asked in NFS was: "In the past four weeks, how many times have you had intercourse?" How much confidence should be placed in the reliability of such information? In order to answer such questions about many variables of interest in fertility surveys, we drew a simple random subsample of 408 women from the 5,617 initially interviewed and reinterviewed them approximately four months later with the same set of questions. (Only the responses of the 354 women under 45 are represented here.) It is clear, of course, that the time referent is different and that there could be genuine change, for instance, because of childbirth or the husband's absence, as well as general temporal variability. For this reason, our estimates of reliability are minimal, and perhaps the more appropriate view is to regard the reported measure as a reflection of stability of behavior (or the perception of behavior) as well as reliability of measurement.4 In any event, our main
3 The Princeton Fertility Study has been supported chiefly by the Carnegie Corporation, and the 1965 National Fertility Study has been supported by the National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development. Both studies received supplementary grants from the Population Council. Both studies have been part of the research program of the Office of Population Research of Princeton University. For further details on the sample and otherfindings of the Princeton Fertility Study, see Westoff et al., 1961, 1963. Information about the NFS sample and estimates of various characteristics of women using oral contraceptives are reported in Ryder and Westoff, 1965.
4 Another factor reducing these measures of consistency is the report of frequency as a range at either one or both interviews. The way range responses were coded could result in situations in which two responses would be considered "inconsistent" by our measures even though one was completely included within the other.

concern here is whether there is any important difference in the consistency of reporting coital frequency for women using the pill compared with women using other methods of contraception which could affect the comparability of changes over time in the coital frequency of the two groups. Perhaps pill users, being generally better educated, might report more reliably.
The measures of aggregate consistency assembled in Table 1 indicate a somewhat higher mean (and variance) of coital frequency as reported in the second interview, a change that could of course be genuine.

ency of reporting by women using the pill could be due to the higher frequency of a younger group; it is easier to be consistent when the behavior reported is less frequent.
RESULTS
We note in Table 2 that the mean coital frequency of 9.2 reported by women taking the pill exceeds the average for women using all other methods of contraception (6.6) by 39%. The average for women currently using no method of contraception is 6.1. This is a heterogeneous category, included mainly for completeness, which includes

Contrary to our expectation, the measures of individual consistency give higher values for women reporting other methods than for women using the pill. Perhaps sexual relations are remembered more accurately when connected with coitus-related methods rather than with the pill or with no method, or perhaps pill users are more likely to be in a phase of the family life cycle where there is more variability in coital frequency.
Although the association between the two reports over the four-month interval seems quite low, there is not enough of a difference between the consistency of wornen using the pill and those using other methods to warrant concern over the aggregate comparisons. The somewhat lower consist-

such diverse groups as women who were pregnant, trying to become pregnant or risking pregnancy, and those who had no need for contraception because of subfecundity.
The 39% difference among all women under 45 is inflated by the fact that younger women are both more likely to use the pill and to have a higher coital frequency than older women. However, when age is controlled, there is still a considerable (though smaller) difference between women who use the pill and those who use other methods, This difference is highest among women under 25 (a 29% difference), but there is still a 20% difference among the older women.

Our present purposes do not include comparing the coital frequency of women using the pill to the frequency of women using other methods for all of the potentially relevant subgroups of the population, but we have included in Table 2 some summary estimates for women classified by race, education, and religion. In general, there ap-

pears to be some group variation in mean coital frequency--white women slightly higher in frequency than nonwhite women, a positive correlation with amount of education, and white Catholic women lower in frequency than white non-Catholic women.

seems to vary both in the educational and in the religious dimension. The higher the education, the more difference the pill seems to make, but an age control would be necessary to interpret this finding. For white Catholic women the rate is 45% higher for those using the pill; for white non-Catholic women it is 34% higher. This difference is due at least in part to the effect of religious beliefs on the more extensive Catholic reliance on the rhythm method, which is in turn associated with lower coital frequency.
What interpretation of the difference between the coital frequency of women using the pill and women using other methods should be offered? Can the difference be attributed directly to the properties of the pill, both psychological and physiological? This conclusion does not necessarily follow, since we have no basis for precluding the possibility that couples with higher rates of coital frequency may be more likely to select the pill because of its unobtrusiveness than those with lower rates. Since we cannot assign women randomly to experimental and control groups, we will never really be able to satisfy the objection that selection may operate, because, even if the two groups reported the same frequency prior to the use of the pill by one of them, the argument could still be advanced that the women who adopted the pill had a higher desired frequency than the other women, but repressed it until their adoption of the pill removed the obstacles to its attainment. Nevertheless, even though it would not provide a final solution to the problem of selection on "desired frequency," the plausibility of our inference about the effect of the pill would be greatly improved if we had a "before" and "after" report of women who did and who did not adopt the pill. This opportunity is afforded by data from the Princeton Fertility Study (PFS).
In 1957, a probability sample of 1,165 married white women who six months earlier had given birth to their second child

were interviewed. The initial sample was confined to seven of the largest metropolitan areas of the United States, but these women were reinterviewed regardless of subsequent change of residence. In 1960, 905 of the original sample were successfully reinterviewed; from 1963-67, six to ten years after the first contact, a total of 814 women were reinterviewed for the third and last time as they approached the end of their reproductive life. The completion rates were higher than these numbers imply (81% and 93% for the two interviews, respectively) because women whose marriages were dissolved were classified as ineligible for reinterview. The third and final interview was spread over five years because the oldest women were interviewed first and the youngest women last.
The data relevant to this analysis are derived from a question on coital frequency asked in the second interview and repeated in the third interview: "In recent months, about how frequently have you and your husband had intercourse? I mean on the average, of course." Although the wording of the question is different from that used in the NFS, the averages are strikingly similar. The mean coital frequency reported by women in the PFS in the third interview is 7.5 for women using the pill and 6.5 for women using other methods. The corresponding averages from the NFS for similar women (white, aged 30-39, who had at least two births) are 7.6 and 6.4, for users of the pill and other methods respectively.
The comparisons of interest are those between the coital frequency rates of 69 women before and after they began using the pill (1960 and 1963-67 respectively) and between the rates at comparable times for the 354 women who used other methods. Since the pill is used more by younger women who normally have a higher average coital frequency even within this relatively homogeneous group aged 30-39, we calculated a rate standardized on the age

distribution of women using the pill in order to control any effect of age on the comparison of the two categories of women.
The main observations from Table 3 are: (1) a 5% increase in mean coital frequency over the five to six years for women who used the pill; (2) a 10% decrease over the same time period for women who used other methods of contraception; (3) no evidence that women with an initially high frequency were attracted to the pill. Given the small number of cases, the change in frequency among women using the pill is not large enough to be statistically significant using the t test for the significance of

to the pill.5 I t is quite impossible from these data and this type of study to determine the relative importance of social, psychological, or biochemical factors in causing this difference.
TIME REQUIRED TOR CONCEPTION
There has been a good deal of speculation and some fragmentary evidence suggesting that the use of oral progesterones facilitates conception after discontinuation; indeed, one of the earliest uses of these drugs was for the promotion of fertility among women of low fecundity, because these compounds regularize the ovulatory cycle and thus

differences between means; but the decrease among women using other methods is significant at the 0.001 level. Prior to the use of the pill, the difference between the mean frequencies for the two categories of women is 0.1 in the opposite direction and not statistically significant, but at reinterview the difference is 1.0 in the predicted direction and significant at the 0.02 level.
In summary, it seems clear from the analysis that the pill does make a difference in coital frequency and that the 18-20% difference for women aged 25-^4 observed in the 1965 National Fertility Study (Table 2) is quite consistent with the difference between the rate for women of comparable age in the Princeton Fertility Study using the pill (7.5) and the rate they theoretically might have had (6.3) if they had not shifted

The data available from the 1965 National Fertility Study provide an opportunity to test the hypothesis that women who have used the pill conceive faster after discontinuing use than women who discontinue other methods in order to conceive.
SOME PROBLEMS OF SELECTIVITY
To compare the conception waiting times in the two types of experience requires imposing several statistical controls to minimize various possibilities that women who had adopted the pill differ from women
5 This hypothetical rate was estimated by applying the 11% decrease for the standardized means of women using other methods to the mean of 7.1 for women who subsequently adopted the pill.

using more traditional methods in ways that could distort the comparison.
There is the possibility that women using the pill might be more fecund since they are younger than women using other methods. The best protection against this bias would be to confine the comparisons to women who were of similar age at the time they discontinued contraception in order to conceive. This control can be reasonably approximated by restricting the analysis to comparisons specific for pregnancy order. At the time of the interruption of contraception for a first pregnancy, women who had used the pill were 21.3 years of age on the average as compared with a mean age of 21.8 for women who had used other methods. The corresponding mean ages for the second pregnancy are 23.3 and 24.0, respectively. Later planned pregnancy orders do not include enough women who had used the pill to permit comparison.
There is also the more troublesome possibility of memory bias; women who interrupt the pill might be apt to remember the event more accurately than women interrupting other methods, since the former is a more radical change in behavior. Whether this memory difference would operate to shorten or lengthen the time period recalled is not clear. Unfortunately the number of women (7) represented in our reinterview sample who deliberately interrupted the pill in order to become pregnant is too small to permit any comparative analysis. It is clear, however, that the reliability of such data in general is low enough to warrant concern. For planned first pregnancies in our sample (even restricting the comparison to women who consistently reported that contraception was used and that the pregnancy was planned), only 62% reported the same number of months required to conceive after interrupting contraception. If the definition of consistency is relaxed to include responses differing by one month, a total of 82% replied consistently. The correspond-

ing estimates for planned second pregnancies are 59% and 76%, respectively.
One control imposed on memory bias, was to confine comparisons to recent pregnancy intervals; only pregnancies terminating since June 1, 1961 are included in our analysis. This truncation should reduce recall error. This date was selected because the pill was licensed for sale in 1960, and our analysis focuses on time required for conception occurring after contraception is deliberately interrupted. This truncation restricts the intervals of women using other methods to a time period after the introduction of the pill.
Even when the above biases are controlled, there remain other differences between pill users and women who used other methods which lead to an expectation of shorter conception times for women who used the pill--quite apart from any direct physiological effects of the compound itself.
DIFFERENCES IN COITAL FREQUENCY
The first section of this paper indicates that women who use the pill tend to have higher rates of coital frequency than women using other methods. Insofar as conception time is related to rates of coital frequency, this factor might lead to an expectation of shorter intervals for women who had used the pill. However, since we asked only the one question on coital frequency in the past four weeks, our data do not include any such measurement relevant to the conception times under consideration. Therefore, the best we can do is to compare, for women currently trying to become pregnant, the rates reported by women whose most recent method used was the pill with those of women who have interrupted the use of other methods.
Since the women who had used the pill are much younger, the coital frequency for women interrupting other methods was adjusted to the age distribution of pill users. The mean frequency (in the preceding four

weeks) for women who had interrupted the pill is 11.7; the mean for women who had interrupted other methods standardized on the age distribution of the younger women who had used the pill is 8.6.6
The next obvious question is whether a difference of this magnitude at this level has any influence on the probability of conception. The answer to this question involves many complexities, such as the assumed length of the fertile period, the length of the menstrual cycle, and the distribution of coitus throughout the cycle. A series of estimates of such probabilities has been prepared based on different assumptions of these distributions; from these we infer that an average difference of between nine and twelve times a month could be expected to reduce the average waiting time from either two or three months to one month if coitus were concentrated in the middle of the month.7 Thus, it is possible that part of any observed difference in waiting times could simply reflect differences in coital frequency rather than any physiological factor. At best, however, this is fairly speculative, given all of the assumptions about the relationship of coital frequency and the probability of conception, as well as the assumption that the differences in coital frequency of women currently using the pill and different methods represent other women's past experience.
DIFFERENCES IN KNOWLEDGE OF THE OVULATORY CYCLE
Considering the fact that women who adopt the pill tend to be more educated than women who adopt or remain with more conventional methods, any difference in the rates of conception between the two groups
6 The unadjusted mean is 7.0. 7 The two values of two and three months reflect respectively a broad and peaked fertile period. These estimates are based on the strong assumption that the women are trying to get pregnant (as is the case in our study) and therefore concentrate coitus in the middle of the cycle. See Lachenbruch, 1967.

might also be influenced by the greater knowledge of the ovulatory cycle by women using the pill. If, for example, a monthly coital frequency of ten is concentrated around the middle of the cycle, the average waiting time for conception would be one or two months (depending upon the assumed distribution of the fertile period) compared with an average of three months if the probability of coitus is equal for any day of the cycle (Lachenbruch, 1967, p. 30). Other distributions of coitus, such as those that might occur for couples with erroneous information about time of ovulation, could result in much longer waiting times.
Our data permit us to determine whether, in fact, women who have used the pill are more knowledgeable about the ovulatory cycle than those who used other methods by comparing their responses to the question: "If a woman has her period every 28 days, on which day does she have the greatest chance of becoming pregnant, counting from the first day her period begins?"
We have used two definitions of the "correct" answer: a narrow definition, including only responses completely enclosed in the range 13-15 days, and a broad definition counting as correct any answer falling in or overlapping with the range of 12-16 days. According to the narrow definition, 58% of the women who planned their last pregnancy after interrupting the pill gave the "correct" answer compared with 48% of the women who had used other methods of contraception. The corresponding results for the broad definition of accurate response are 69% and 64%.
Although the differences are in the expected direction, they do not appear large enough to account for much variation in conception rates between the two groups. We also note that a substantial proportion of the women, whatever the method used, are ignorant of ovulation time.

Oral Contraception

RESULTS
Our interview schedule contained questions designed to permit an approximate separation of each pregnancy interval into components of contraceptive and noncontraceptive exposure for women who had deliberately interrupted contraception in order to conceive. The total interval, after subtracting time pregnant and in postpartum, is decomposed into contraceptive exposure and the interval between the time

of women who had used conventional methods occurred earlier in time, whereas women who interrupted use of the pill are concentrated in the later part of this interval. Consequently, women who interrupted conventional methods have had a much greater opportunity to experience longer waiting times than those who interrupted the pill. This bias can be dealt with by conventional life table procedures in which the probability of "surviving" any given month is

contraception was interrupted and conception. This waiting time is estimated from the answers to the question: "How many months after you stopped using a method did you become pregnant?" For women who are currently trying to become pregnant (a somewhat higher proportion being pill users) but who had not succeeded by the time of interview, the waiting time information derives from the question: "How long ago did you stop using a method?"
Even during the limited period of time concerned (June, 1961 to September, 1965) a much greater proportion of the experience

based only upon the experience of women exposed to that month. The cumulative probability of remaining not pregnant through a given month is the cumulative product of the preceding monthly probabilities of survival (see Potter, 1966).
The number of women with over six months of exposure is insufficient to permit reliable estimates of the monthly probability of conception beyond the sixth month. Consequently, mean conception times in Table 4 are based only on the first six months of exposure. The probability of remaining nonpregnant through the twelfth month is

10

presented for general reference, but is based on insufficient cases to be statistically reliable.
Two things should be noted from Table 4. In the first place, contrary to our expectations, mean conception times are not shorter for women whointerrupted the pill than for women who interrupted other methods. Considering the data for all four pregnancy orders combined, 85%of the pill users were pregnant by the end of sixmonths and their mean waiting time was 2.3 months, whereas for those using other methods 87% were pregnant by the endof sixmonths, and their mean waiting time was 2.1 months. The differences are in the same direction when comparisons are made specific for pregnancy order, although the size of the difference between means is larger.
Second, we note from Table 4 that the distributions of waiting time for pill users and others differ in one particular regard: Pill users are less likely to report getting pregnant during the first month of exposure.

Again considering the example of the first four pregnancies combined, 46% of the women using other methods and 37% of the pill users report waiting times of one month or less. This difference, if reliable, could result from reporting differences between the two groups. In the first place, there maybe misreporting of the circumstances of pregnancy. An accidental pregnancy reported as "planned" would contribute the shortest possible interval--and the likelihood of such misreporting would be greater for women using less effective methods than for women using the pill. Second, there may be differences related to sophistication between the two groups in interpretation of the question of how long it takes to become pregnant.
Taking into account all of the above, it is our considered conclusion that there is no difference in the time required to conceive between women who have used the pill and women who have used other methods of contraception.
