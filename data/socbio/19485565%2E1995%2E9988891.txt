ABSTRACT: Based on the 1989 Demographic and Health Survey of Bolivia, analysis of the joint effects of breastfeeding and contraceptive use on birth-spacing showed the IUD to be the most effective contraceptive method used to delay conception. Breastfeeding significantly lengthened the birth interval, but only following second and higher parity births. In addition, conditions of poverty appeared to further inhibit the return of fecundity and delay conception.

The goal of many policy makers and family planners is to improve the health of women and children by eliminating unwanted pregnancies and lengthening the birth interval through the adoption of contraception. Breastfeeding, however, can also influence these patterns, as can other maternal characteristics. Both lactation and contraceptive practices, therefore, need to be examined simultaneously in order to evaluate their influence on birthspacing.
In this study, I examine factors influencing the spacing of births in Bolivia, one of the most impoverished nations of Latin America. I model the joint effects of breastfeeding and contraceptive use on birth-spacing for a sample of women giving birth between 1984 and 1989.
BACKGROUND
Lactation and contraceptive use are both proximate determinants of fertility, that is, they directly affect fertility and are the mechanisms through which other social and cultural factors oper-

ate (Bongaarts and Potter, 1983). At the individual level, frequent and intense breastfeeding after giving birth reduces a woman's exposure to conception by lengthening the period of postpartum amenorrhea. In addition, the use of contraception further reduces the likelihood of another conception.
Breastfeeding, by stimulating high prolactin levels, prolongs anovulation and the period of postpartum amenorrhea (Jain et al., 1970; Habicht et al., 1984; Gray, 1981). Over time, however, the contraceptive effect diminishes (Jain et al., 1970; Gray, 1981). In general, the duration of infecundity due to lactation does not appear to be extendable much beyond two years (Bracher and Santow, 1982).
The influence of lactation on the duration of postpartum amenorrhea depends on various other factors, making the relationship between lactation and fertility difficult to define. Previous studies indicate that the inhibiting effect of lactation on fertility is greatest when modern contraceptive use is low, lactation is unsupplemented, and the nutritional status of the mother is low

(Van Landingham et al., 1991;Santow, 1987; Huffman, 1987; Ramachandran, 1987; Fink et al., 1992; Hull, 1987).
Past research has also found contraceptive use to be negatively related to breastfeeding, and this negative relationship is not well understood (Millman, 1985; National Research Council, 1989). Some argue that both breastfeeding reduction and contraceptive use are, in part, brought on by development and lifestyle changes as women adapt to employment outside of the home. Previous research has found urbanization and increased education (indicators of development) to be associated with declines in traditional breastfeeding practices and increases in modern contraceptive use (Cochrane, 1979; Ramachandran, 1987; Westoff et al., 1989; Da Vanzo and Starbird, 1991).
In Bolivia, development is limited. The majority of the population are rural farmers, and education levels, especially for women, are low. In 1988, the majority of childbearing-age women had completed less than eight years of schooling (Instituto Nacional de Estadística, 1989). Breastfeeding is almost universally practiced, and modern contraceptive use is rare. There is, however, some evidence to suggest that, at least in urban centers, the majority of women desire to limit their family size and want access to modern contraception (Roosta, 1989). Other studies of Bolivian women have found that breastfeeding durations are declining in urban areas, in particular among women from middle and high income groups, women with higher education, women who work long hours, and women who receive prenatal care and information (Anaya, 1984).

Building upon this literature, and in an effort to explore further these issues in an impoverished setting, I address the research question: How do breastfeeding and contraceptive use jointly influence birth-spacing, an important factor in child and maternal health?
In response to this question, I model the simultaneous effects of lactation and contraceptive use on birthspacing. In addition, I include various controls for family background and birth characteristics. The relationships between lactation, contraceptive use and fertility are observed within a context of poverty as I focus on the lives of women and children in Bolivia, one of the poorest nations in Latin America.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
THE DATA
Data from the 1989 Demographic and Health Survey of Bolivia are used to examine breastfeeding practices, contraceptive use, and birth-spacing. The DHS provides a rich source of information on demographic processes previously undocumented in Bolivia. The Bolivian sample is of women aged 15 to 49 in 1989 and consists of 7,923 completed interviews.
The DHS includes a birth history of all live births of sampled women. More in-depth information, including contraceptive use and breastfeeding information, is provided for live-births occurring during a five-year period prior to the interview date. Because the information required by my objectives is contained in the five-year histories, women who bore children during this period are the primary focus of the analyses.

MODEL SPECIFICATIONS

The variables in the fertility model

I model the effects of lactation and contraceptive use on birth-spacing as shown in Figure 2. This fertility model estimates the effects of a woman'scontraceptive use and lactation practices following a birth on the likelihood of her having another conception. In addition, controls for bio-demographic, family background, and community environmental factors are included in the analyses.
The model analyzes the mother's experience translated into personmonths and focuses on the interval beginning with the birth of the index child.1 The event examined is the like-

and their operational definitions are provided in Table 1. In order to control for parity, the dependent variable-- the interval from birth of the index child to a succeeding conception--is analyzed separately by parity. The following groups are examined: (1) first birth to second conception, (2) second birth to third conception, (3) third birth to fourth conception, and (4) fourth birth to fifth conception and all higher order intervals.3
Using event-history techniques, the fertility model is analyzed separately for each of the birth intervals andassumes the form:

Lactation and Contraceptive Use

1. Lactation Stopped

A time-varying covariate indicating whether breastfeeding never started or was stopped.

2. Contraceptive Method Used
Controls A. Bio-demographic 1. Index Child Living .

A set of dummy variables indicating the type of contraceptive method used following the index child's birth. The following categories are measured:
Method 1 = pill or hormonal injections. Method 2 = IUD/diaphragm/condoms. Method 3 = rhythm/withdrawal/other. Method 4 = no contraceptive method used.
A time-varying covariate indicating whether the index child died prior to the following conception or age two.

Explanation
The conception date is estimated as the date of birth minus 8.5 months for conceptions resulting in a live birth. Pregnancies at the time of interview are also included, and the conception date is determined by subtracting the length of the pregnancy from the interview date.
Indicates duration of lactation which is associated with the period of postpartum anovulation. A second timevarying covariate indicating missing cases (about 0.5 per cent of the total) is also included in the model. Method 4 is the omitted category. Cases in which sterilization was the contraceptive method used following an index birth are excluded.
Control for "replacement" behavior. If an infant dies, parents may attempt to "replace" death with another birth, resulting in a shorter birth interval.

estimated. The event history analyses are computed using the program CTM (Continuous Time Models).
The main variables of interest are lactation and contraceptive use. Lactation is a time-varying covariate that indicates whether breastfeeding was stopped or ever started. I expect the stopping of lactation to shorten the period of anovulation and increase the likelihood of a next conception. Measures of contraceptive use indicate the type of contraceptive method used after the birth of the index child. And I expect contraceptive use to decrease the likelihood of a subsequent conception, depending on the effectiveness of the method used.
Various controls for bio-demographic, family background, and community environmental factors are also included in the model and defined in Table 1. One important bio-demographic factor in regard to birthspacing is a control for "replacement" behavior, which refers to compensating for the loss of an infant. A short birth interval may be either the cause or the result of a child death. Following an infant death, breastfeeding generally ends, resulting in a short birth interval due to the early return of ovulation (Da Vanzo and Starbird, 1991). In addition, if an infant dies, parents may attempt to "replace" the death with another birth, also resulting in a short birth interval (Winikoff, 1987; National Research Council, 1989). In an effort to replace the lost child, parents may increase the frequency of intercourse and/or reduce contraceptive use (Da Vanzo and Starbird, 1991).
In the model, the measures of contraceptive use indicate only the type of

contraceptive method used, not the duration of use. Thus, the death of an index child may measure shorter durations of contraceptive use and/or increases in the frequency of intercourse--both proximate determinants of fertility. Therefore, to control for the occurrence of a prior death and subsequent "replacement" behaviors, a time-varying covariate indicating whether the index child died before age two and prior to the conception of the next child is included in the model.
Other bio-demographic factors included in the model are the gender of the index child, and the age of the mother at the index birth. In some cultures sex preferences translate into behaviors that either protect or place infants at risk. Sex preferences are not dominant in Latin culture, therefore, the effect of this factor is likely to be weak. I expect age of mother at birth to influence fertility negatively. Fecundity declines with age. Thus, the older the mother at the birth of the index child, the less likely a subsequent conception will follow.
Family background factors (defined in Table 1), such as female education and employment are likely to reduce the probability of a following conception. I expect more highly educated women (nine years of schooling or more) and women who work full-time for pay to have lower fertility than women with little or no education and women who work at home (Cochrane, 1979). Women with more education generally desire relatively smaller families and have more reproductive knowledge and access to contraception than women with little or no education (Lee and Bulato, 1983).

Partner's education is used as a proxy for socioeconomic status.4 It is likely that higher partner's education or socioeconomic status will decrease the probability of a following conception. However, because it is a crude measure, I expect its effect to be weak. Again, women from higher economic groups generally prefer smaller families and have access to better health care and family planning resources than do poor women. In Bolivia, modern contraceptive useis more prevalent among urban, highly educated women (secondary schooling or above); and access to modern health care and higher education is largely limited to the urban elite.
Union formation of the mother is another time-varying covariate. I expect this background factor to increase the likelihood of another conception. Exposure to intercourse increases following entry into either marriage or cohabitation, and thus is another proximate determinant of fertility (Bongaarts and Potter, 1983). Union disruption due to separation, widowhood, or divorce decreases fertility; hence, a control for this factor is also included in the model. Because acomplete marital history is not provided in the DHS, this measure is only an approximation of union disruption based on the status of the first union at the date of interview. This measure, therefore, is expected to be weak.
I expect the likelihood of a subsequent conception to be greater in the Altiplano and Valles regions than in

the Llanos region due to the large concentration of indigenous groups in the first two areas (see Table 1). In addition, because of development and greater access to education and modern medical care, fertility is likely to be lower in urban zones than in rural areas (Roosta, 1989).5
Ethnicity, indicated by the language usually spoken at home, is important because of the variations in fertility behaviors among the indigenous, mestizo, and white populations. Indigenous groups, compared to other ethnic groups, have the highest fertility in Bolivia (Anaya, 1984). However, the measure of language spoken in the DHS does not isolate bilingual speakers from those who speak only one language; thus, many bilingual mestizos are defined as Spanish speakers in the DHS, although culturally they are more like the indigenous population (Alexander, 1982). This blurring of the bilingual speakers with both the Spanish and indigenous groups greatly weakens this measure of ethnicity.
RESULTS
BREASTFEEDING PRACTICES AND
CONTRACEPTIVE USE
Most infants in Bolivia are breastfed and durations of lactation are long, with average weaning age being about 16 months (Anaya, 1984). Almost all infants born between 1984 and 1989
5The Bolivian DHS measure of urbanizationdemarcates any center with a population of 2,500 or more inhabitants as "urban." Thus, it is notpossible to distinguish between residence in large metropolitan cites, such as La Paz, and small villages. The effect of this variable, therefore, is likely to be weak.

were breastfed--96 per cent. However, by the date of interview over two-thirds of the infants had stopped suckling. Modern contraceptive use in Bolivia is very low; only about 12 per cent of all married (formal and informal) Bolivian women were using modern contraceptive methods in 1989.
THE FERTILITY MODEL
In order to study the simultaneous effects of breastfeeding and contraceptive use on fertility, I model the relationship between lactation and contraceptive use and birth-spacing with controls for parity and other background factors. The results of these multivariate analyses are presented in Table 2. The cessation of breastfeeding significantly increased the likelihood of another conception for second and higher parities. The conception rate for second or higher parity births not breastfed was approximately 1.5 to 2 times that of breastfed infants. However, breastfeeding firstborn infants had no effect on the likelihood of a second conception. The lactation coefficient for first births is positive, but not significant, regardless of other factors introduced into the model.
All contraceptive methods significantly reduced the likelihood of a following conception for all parities, but the most effective method of contraception was the IUD.6 IUD use
6Only about 2 per cent of contraceptive users for all parities used barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms) compared to over 10 per cent who used IUD's. Because of the smaller number of barrier users, these factors were combined. In addition, hormonal injection users were combined with hormonal pill users, again because of the small number of injection users. Traditional methods include the rhythm method, withdrawal, and "other" methods.

had the largest effect for all parities. Women using an IUD following a third or lower parity birth were six to seven times less likely to conceive again than were women who used no contraception at all. And IUD users with four or more children were almost 40 times less likely to conceive again than women not using any contraceptive method.
The use of oral and hormonal contraceptives, as well as traditional contraceptive methods, reduced the likelihood of another conception compared to no contraceptive use at all. Women who used oral or hormonal contraceptives were about 2.4 to 4.7 times less likely to have another conception than women not using any contraception. And women who used traditional methods were two to three times less likely to conceive again than women not using any form of contraception.
The death of an index child before age two increased the likelihood of a subsequent conception at lower parities. Living second and lower parity births were 1.5 to 1.7 times less likely to be followed by another conception than were children who died before age two. At third parities, the effect of a death was not significant, and for fourth and higher parities the odds declined to 1.2. This finding suggests that replacement behaviors, such as increased frequency of intercourse or reductions in the duration of contraceptive use, are more likely to follow the death of a low parity birth (second or lower parity) than a higher parity birth.
Over 59 per cent of the contraceptive users used the rhythm method for all parities.

SOURCE: Demographic Health Survey, Bolivia, 1989. "Data are unweighted. Standard errors, in parenthesis. Category "Fourth to Fifth" includes all higher parity birth intervals. 'Time-varying covariates. 'P < 0.001. dP < 0.01. ·P < 0.05.
/Only 1 per cent of first unions were formed after the third birth, so this variable was not included in the models for third birth to fourth, and fourth to fifth, and subsequent intervals.

The desire to "replace" a lost child may diminish once a certain family size is attained.
Entry into first union, either formal marriage or cohabitation, increased the odds of another conception compared to remaining single, as did remaining in a union following a first birth. Most Bolivian women marry, and their unions are relatively stable over time. At the date of the interview, 85 per cent of the women were in unions, and of these, 93 per cent were still in their first union. However, because a complete marital history is not available, the measure of union stability only corresponds to recently formed unions. The weak effects reflect, in part, weak measurement.
Sex of child was not significant in any of the models, as expected. This findinglends support to my contention that gender preference is not important in determining family size in Bolivia. The age of the mother at birth of the index child was negative and significant for all parities. Older mothers, in par-

ticular following high parity births, were less likely to have another conception than were younger mothers.
Measures of mother's education indicate that higher education (nine or more years of school), compared to basic levels of schooling (1 to 5), lowered the odds of another conception occurring. With the inclusion of measures of contraceptive use in the model, the effects of higher education diminished, except for third and higher parities. For third and higher parities, nine or more years of education, compared to basic schooling, lowered the odds of giving birth by about 1.5. Thus, in Bolivia, secondary schooling is associated with contraceptive knowledge and use.
Mothers who work for pay were less likely to have a subsequent conception than mothers not working for pay. For all parities, if the woman worked for pay, she was about 1.3 times less likely to have another conception than if she did not. Employment outside the home may indicate reduced exposure to intercourse or increased contraceptive

use, both of which lengthen the birth interval.
Women married to partners with no schooling were generally 1.4 to 2 times less likely to have another conception than were women whose partners had basic levels of schooling. This result was somewhat surprising and is discussed later. Having no partner at the date of interview, compared to having a partner with little education (1 to 5 years), lowered the odds of conception by at least 2.5 times. This finding suggests that being single in Bolivia (widowed, divorced, separated, or never married), reduces a woman's exposure to intercourse and the risk of conception. Because it is measured at the date of interview, however, partner information does not necessarily correspond with the birth history and must be interpreted with caution.
Regional effects on family formation emerged at higher parities. Living in the Altiplano and Valles regions, compared to living in the Llanos region, reduced the odds of conception by 1.3. The greatest concentration of indigenous peoples are in the Altiplano and Valles regions. This same result is reflected in the coefficients for language spoken at home. Among women with four or more births, speaking an indigenous language, compared to speaking Spanish, lowered the odds of conception by about 1.3.
Urban residence reduced the risk of a subsequent conception for all except third parity births. For second and lower parity births, women living in urban centers were approximately 1.2 times less likely to have another conception than were rural women.
These findings reflect differences in stopping and spacing behavior associ-

ated with ethnicity and urbanization. Poor, rural, indigenous women generally do not attempt to limit family size, but continue childbearing throughout their fecund years. In contrast, highly educated, urban women both limit and space their births. Further discussion of these results follows.
DISCUSSION
LACTATION
Breastfeeding by Bolivian mothers prolonged the birth-interval and significantly reduced the likelihood of a subsequent conception, but only for second and higher parity births. Two possible factors may account for differences by parity: (1) maternal health, and (2) breastfeeding patterns.
Previous research indicates that repeated pregnancies and poor nutrition deplete the mother's body and lengthen the period of postpartum amenorrhea (Huffman, 1987; Carballo, 1987). In addition, studies of the effects of nutritional supplementation on lactating women determined that fertility returned faster after the nutritional status of the mother improved (Ramachandran, 1987; Fink et al., 1992).
Mothers of firstborn children are generally in better health than women who have experienced additional pregnancies and deliveries. It is possible that ovulation returns sooner following the birth of the first child, despite long durations of lactation. Similarly, the contraceptive effect of breastfeeding may be greater following repeated pregnancies due to the depletion of the mother's nutritional status. Unfortunately, I am unable to evaluate mother's nutritional status in this study.

Other studies, however, suggest that variations in breastfeeding practices account for parity effects on fertility (Ramachandran, 1987). Breastfeeding practices may differ by parity because initiating breastfeeding for the first time may be more difficult than subsequent breastfeeding experiences, and thus the intensity of breastfeeding may vary.
Breastfeeding is a learned behavior and requires the coordination of several reflexes. The interplay of these reflexes is often difficult to establish. Because most women in Bolivia breastfeed their infants, their first lactation experience generally follows the first birth, and difficulties establishing and maintaining lactation the first time may reduce its contraceptive effect (Da Vanzo et al., 1990). Thus, the lack of a breastfeeding effect on fertility following the first birth may indicate differences in the intensity and frequency of breastfeeding by parity, both of which influence the duration of postpartum anovulation (Ramachandran, 1987).
CONTRACEPTIVE USE
The use of the IUD (compared to not using any contraception) was the most effective method in lowering the odds of another conception. However, of all women sampled, less than 5 per cent were IUD users, and less than 12 per cent used any form of modern contraception. Once inserted, the effectiveness of the IUD, unlike other forms of contraception, does not depend on a woman's knowledge of reproduction (as does the rhythm method) or her behavior (as do oral contraceptives or barrier methods). Thus, little education is needed for

women to use the IUD effectively. For other contraceptive methods, such as the pill, diaphragm, or rhythm method to be used more effectively, increased education of women, especially in regard to reproduction and contraceptive use, is needed.
For all parities, higher maternal education (nine or more years of schooling) lowered the odds of another conception. This effect diminished at lower parities, however, once contraceptive use was added to the model. Thus, higher maternal education is linked to increased contraceptive knowledge and use at lower parities. For high parity births (third and higher), increased maternal education lowered the odds of conception even after contraceptive use was taken into account. Thus, after three births, higher education, compared to basic schooling, reduced the relative risk of conception independent of contraceptive use. Among women with three or more births, it is probable that increased education, compared to only basic schooling, not only promotes contraceptive use, but also increases the duration of use and the likelihood that methods are used effectively (Da Vanzo and Starbird, 1991).
FAMILY BACKGROUND AND COMMUNITY
ENVIRONMENT
For all parities, mothers whose current partner had no education were less likely to have another conception than mothers whose partners had a basic education. This result seems counterintuitive; one would expect education to be negatively associated with fertility. Higher education is generally associated with the desire to limit total

family size or stopping behavior, and the ability to space births (Cochrane, 1979). Most poor, indigenous women in Bolivia do not practice family limitation or stopping behavior, but do engage in behaviors, such as prolonged lactation, that influence birth-spacing. In addition, other factors, such as maternal health and nutrition interact with lactation and influence the length of the birth interval.
In the fertility model, partner's education provides a crude measure of socioeconomic status, and in this case, no education is possibly an indicator of extreme poverty. As shown in Table 3, a higher percentage of current partners with no education work in agriculture and farm their own land compared to educated partners. The higher the education level of the partner, the lower the percentage who farm their own land and the higher the percentage who receive a regular salary from nonagricultural work. This suggests that education and occupation effects inter-

act producing an index of poverty. Men with no education generally are poor, subsistence level farmers compared to those with at least some education.
In Bolivia, peasant farmers in general lack access to waste removal systems, potable water, and modern health services which influence overall health and nutritional status (Anaya, 1984). In addition poor farmers in the Altiplano and Valles regions are able to farm only one or two crops a year. They must confront harsh ecological conditions that often result in the total loss of a harvest. Vegetables and staples are the primary crops, and there is little access to markets. Families who live in such conditions of extreme poverty are more likely to suffer from malnutrition and disease, and poor health and nutrition negatively influence fecundity (Huffman, 1987; Carballo, 1987; Ramachandran, 1987; Fink et al., 1992). Low nutritional status extends the period of post partum

amenorrhea, especially among lactating women.7 In addition, poor health can depress fecundity by increasing the risk of fetal loss. An increase in the occurrence of fetal loss will result in longer birth intervals. Only conceptions ending in live births were included in this analysis. Therefore, conceptions ending in spontaneous abortion were not accounted for.
In the fertility model, conditions of poverty were further compounded by race for high parity births. Both region and language spoken significantly influencedthe odds of conception following four or more births. Indigenous speakers and those living in highly indigenous regions were less likely to experience another conception than were Spanish speakers or those living in the Llanos region. Again, it is probable that indigenous women live in conditions of severe poverty which inhibit fecundity. Especially after multiple births, indigenous women, and those living in highly concentrated indigenous regions are more apt to have poor health and limited access to health services, clean water, and waste removal systems. Disease and malnutrition are products of their impoverished environment.
Thus, lactating women living in impoverished households and communities are likely to experience long periods of postpartum amenorrhea. Although poorer women may have higher total fertility than women with
7Interactions between lactation and partner's education (available from the author), although not significant for all parities, were in the expected direction. Results indicate that living in poverty extends the effect of lactation on anovulation, further reducing the likelihood of another conception.

higher socioeconomic status, extreme conditions of poverty, in which many Bolivian peasants live, may depress fecundity and lengthen the time to conception. In addition, the negative effect of poverty on fecundity is exacerbated by multiple pregnancies.
The results of this fertility model highlight the need to improve the health of women and their children, especially those living in extreme poverty, by eliminating unwanted pregnancies and reducing total family size. Efforts to improve the health and wellbeing of the indigenous and poorest population must be coupled with increased contraceptive use in order to space and limit births, in particular, as the negative influence of poverty on fecundity is reduced.
However, with increased education (i.e., at the primary and secondary levels) and contraceptive use, it is essential that traditional breastfeeding practices not decline to the detriment of Bolivian children. Hence, the need to introduce effective contraceptive methods, and at the same time to promote and support breastfeeding, remains a major policy issue for health planners in developing countries such as Bolivia.
Although my results emphasize the importance of lactation and contraceptive use in fertility regulation in Bolivia, greater understanding of the links among breastfeeding, contraceptive use, and the health and well-being of women and children in poverty is required. In particular, further research is needed to elucidate the negative relationship between breastfeeding and contraceptive use, particularly in the context of the developing world.
