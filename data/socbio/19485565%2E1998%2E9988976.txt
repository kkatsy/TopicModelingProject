ABSTRACT.This paper revisits and extends an inquiry on the age-at-menarche differential fecundity hypothesis. Earlier studies have interpreted the difference in the onset of female pubertal maturation as indicative of biological differences in fecundity between early and late menarcheal women. Using the WFS data for Sudan, the authors address the entire reproductive life of the women in terms of their transition from one parity to the next, as well as the speed with which birth intervals are closed, as a way to infer biological fecundity among the women. The study concludes that there is little evidence that early menarcheal women are more fecund than their late puberty counterparts.

Although there is little agreement among scholars on how the mechanisms involved actually predispose early menarche girls to early sexual and reproductive activities in comparison to late maturing girls, research efforts have interpreted the differences in the onset of female pubertal maturation as the index of biological differences in fecundity between early and late menarcheal women. This interpretation was given by Ryder and Westoff (1971) to the results of their study, to the extent that these differences are believed to persist throughout the reproductive life span of women. Udry and Cliquet (1982) have hypothesized and concluded that women with early puberty are more fecund than women with late puberty, leading to earlier births for a given exposure to the risk of pregnancy. In fact, Udry (1979) was more categorical, stating that "those women with early puberty have more efficient functioning reproductive systems, leading to higher fecundability independent of sexual behavior." This

conclusion, in our opinion, must suggest--especially in populations which are governed by natural fertility--that early maturers are necessarily and systematically different from those with late menarche in their process of family building.
This paper revisits this question by examining the ways in which the reproductive behavior of a woman is determined by how early or how late in adolescence she has attained her puberty. Addressing the entire reproductive life of women (in order to examine the claim that these differences persist throughout the reproductive life), we study the transition from one parity to the next, as well as the speed or timing of reproduction, using birth intervals and parity progression ratios from which we may infer biological fecundity among women. We contend that while the initiation phase of the family-building process poses no problem, as it has indeed been observed that puberty is a potent factor in discriminating age at marriage (Otor, 1995; Presser, 1978; Udry, 1979;

Udry and Cliquet, 1982; Zelnik, 1981), the problem is with the subsequent phases as they embody the actual reproduction.
The family-formation process is viewed as the progression of women through marriage and first, subsequent, and last births. The process consists of three phases--initiation, expansion, and completion (Pandey and Suchindran, 1989). With respect to the first phase, some approaches have emphasized the role of socioeconomic factors as the sole determinants of how soon a woman enters into marriage for future family-building activity (Blossfeld and Huinink, 1991). Though this can hardly be denied, these approaches have been oblivious to the fact that there is a biological substrate which predisposes some people to earlier marriage than others. Whether or not puberty acts independently on age at marriage or is mediating the effect of socioeconomic factors is not entirely clear because empirical evidence regarding this relationship is not conclusive.
On the other hand, the expansion and completion phases are concerned with the fact that the family begins to function as a reproductive unit with the onset of first birth and subsequent and last births. The importance of considering the last two phases in an investigation like the present one lies in the fact that the intervals between successive births, especially in natural fertility populations, shed light on the fecundity of women. For instance, the average length of closed birth intervals is influenced by the overall level of fecundity (Srinivasan et al, 1987; Tsui, 1982). The family formation process, thus, can be a useful way of testing the age-at-menarche differential fecundity hypothesis.
In an attempt to carry out this test, we decompose the age at which the family formation process is completed (i.e., the

age at last birth) into its constituent parts for each menarche group or "maturation status." Here maturation status consists of three age-at-menarche categories: early maturation (EM) which includes early maturers, i.e., those who attained menarche by ages 12 and below; midway maturation (MM) which includes midway maturers or those who attained their menarche between 13 and 14 years; and late maturation (LM) which includes late maturers or those who attained their menarche by ages 15 and above. It may be pointed out that this classification is not entirely arbitrary. Rather, it has been decided on the basis of the generally held view about early and late female pubertal timing.
Age at last birth has undoubtedly been the subject of methodological controversy. In particular, this controversy has centered on the fact that while the age at last birth has been claimed as an indicator of stopping behavior (Knodel, 1987), it has also been considered as reflecting changes in spacing behavior (Koo et al., 1987; Pandey et al., 1993). For instance, Anderton (1989) has argued that increases in interlive birth interval may be anticipated to increase open intervals and thereby lower age at last birth. Notwithstanding this controversy, age at last birth can be a good measure for our purpose at hand, in so far as the onset of infecundity in women in natural fertility situations is concerned. McDonald and Knodel (1989), for example, have noted that a woman with n births is precluded from having the (n + 7)th birth because, given the existing pattern of birth intervals, she becomes infecund before sufficient time has elapsed to have the next birth. The nth birth, thus, becomes her last birth. In this situation of natural fertility, therefore, age at last birth is determined by age at onset of infecundity

and the distance in time that the nth birth happens to precede the onset of infecundity. The present discussion is not intended to distinguish between the effect of stopping and spacing behaviors on age at last birth. Rather, it is concerned with physiological fecundity. Hence, the controversy is of little relevance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A decision on the formulation that links the age at last birth with its constituent or component parts is a crucial step in providing the estimates required. Knodel (1987), who followed McDonald's (1984) earlier work, has provided such a formulation, but he has assumed the mean birth intervals to remain constant over the women's parity. Variation in the birth interval was introduced by Suchindran and Koo (1992), such that the mean age at last birth (ALB) is given by,

ÄLB = ÄFB + f\B/f
i=2

(1)

S denotes the proportion of these women who have at least one birth; L is the mean age at last birth; M is the mean age at marriage among women who ever have a birth, and F and /, respectively, represent the mean length of the first birth interval, and the mean length of interlive birth intervals. McDonald has used this model to develop a method of stepwise standardization. In addition to Suchindran and Koo's formulation above, we shall employ this standardization procedure to assess the relative impact of these components by puberty.
Use is also made of Suchindran and Koo's formulation employing the decomposition methodology developed by Das Gupta (1991). Here the difference between two menarche-group mean ages at last birth is decomposed into the effects of the differences in five factors--one scalar factor and four vector factors. These factors are age at first birth, earlier PPR's, later PPR's, earlier birth intervals, and later birth intervals, that is,

where, AFB is the mean age at first birth,

ALB = F(A,B,C,D,E)

F¡ = Tr'r}0PPRj, the probability of having

an ith-order birth, and BI¡, the mean birth where, interval between (i--/)th and /th birth, and

k, the maximum attainable parity. In fact, A = age at first birth,

McDonald (1984), whose formulation was turned the other way round as seen above, was actually concerned with the fact that a woman's completed fertility is

B = (PPRV PPR2), or a vector-factor comprising PPR's to second and third or-
der births,

where, B denotes the mean number of children ever born to a group of women;

E = (B/4, BI5, ...), or a vector-factor comprising the mean birth intervals to the fourth through higher order births.

Das Gupta's formulation permits the examination of the consequences for mean age at last birth of the simultaneous changes in all five factors. Suppose that the factors assume the values of (a,b,c,d,e) in the midway maturers (MM) and (A,B,C,D,E) in the late maturers (LM), for instance. Then the difference in their mean ages at last birth is

DATA AND ANALYSIS
This analysis utilizes data from the individual survey of 3,115 women from the WFS for Sudan (or SUDFS) carried out between December 1978 and April 1979. Reference to "Sudan" in any analysis based on the WFS data, in fact, is a matter of convenience as the survey covered only the six northern regions of the country, referred to as "Northern Sudan," as opposed to the remaining three regions, "Southern Sudan." The two are farther apart in religious beliefs than in anything else, Northern Sudan being primarily a Muslim population while Southern Sudan largely professes traditional African beliefs. However, the social factors that predispose women to marriage and its consummation apparently are the same, and different from those in some parts of India where 6 to 8 months elapse between marriage and the time when cohabitation takes place (Pandey et al., 1990). Richard and Galal el Din (1982) believe that some of these factors that hasten cohabitation, evidently irrespective of religious beliefs, in Sudan are:

(0 the fear of loss of virginity and the consequent loss of honor and bride price (which is paid by the father of the bridegroom to the father of thebride);

(ii) the fact that marriage and childbearing are the most important functions in a woman's life, and parents have no benefit in delaying their daughter from fulfilling the second function (i.e., childbearing) once she has been given in marriage;
(Hi) the desire of the groom's mother to have household help.
In using the WFS data, there are a number of analytical implications. We will note that overall, 2,898 of the 3,115 women reported their ages at menarche. Of the remaining 217, only 5 had not started menstruating at the time of the interview, while the other 212 women did not state anything about their menarche. Generally, the WFS sample is extended only to women aged below 50. Thus, a high proportion of these women will not have completed their fertility by the time of the survey. Therefore, the choice of women included for analysis in this paper had to be done within at least two constraints: one was to include a reasonably large number of women; the other was to choose them in such a way that they have an exposure period long enough to have completed their fertility.
The choice of the area to be covered by the WFS is a potential methodological problem when analyzing the data, particularly with respect to the religion variable. Because this survey was exclusively conducted in the Muslim North of the country, there were only 2 per cent of nonMuslim women included in the sample.1
1We are grateful to a reviewer who has drawn our attention to the usefulness of carrying out a comparative analysis of Muslim and non-Muslim populations to determine the influence of religion on events, such as the consummation of marriage in Sudan. This approach, however, has been precluded by this methodological problem.

woman has some idea that her fertility will end around a particular age, then it will be more appropriate to enter L before /. Finally, 5 parameter is entered last because it is more a group adjustment factor than a measure of individual behavior. It may be pointed out that McDonald has generated a hypothetical standard population by combining median values of M, F, L, I and S for 34 WFSpopulations.
The first of these ratios, BMI Bstd, indicates the extent to which fertility would be altered by the different exposure time deriving from age at marriage in the given population compared to that in the standard population. This ratio does not allow for the level of age-specific fecundity during the increment of exposure time. The fecundity factor is largely taken into account when, with the second ratio, BF I Bstd, the length of the first birth interval of the given population is included. The length of the first birth interval also embodies the influences of factors such as delay consummation, irregularity of sexual intercourse early in marriage, and premarital births or pregnancies. Hence, the second ratio reflects the impact of variation of the age at first birth. With the third ratio, BL I Bstd, the additional impact of stopping (reflecting the onset of infecundity in women) is included. While the fourth ratio, Bj I Bstd, is expected to reflect the overall level of fecundity, the fifth ratio, Bs I Bs!d, shows the influence of primary sterility.

presented in Table 4 and plotted in Figure I.2 The impact of the particular behavior can be gauged from the line preceding the plotted point. For instance, if the line slopes upward, the parameter (in question) is contributing to higher fertility than the standard. On the other hand, if the line slopes downward, the parameter is contributing to lower fertility than the standard. A relatively horizontal line is an indication that there is very little variation from the standard.
Because age at marriage is late for MM and LM compared to the "standard population," the influence of age at marriage (M) is toward lower fertility in both MM and LM than in the standard. This effect is offset by relatively shorter F in the MM-population while it is increased by relatively longer F in the LM population, compared to the standard, which is indicated by the appropriate change--an increase (decrease) by 2 percentage points in MM-population (LM-population)--in the second ratio (ßF I Bstd) after addition of F. A late stopping (i.e., higher age at last birth) in both MM and LM is contributing to higher fertility than the standard. Thereafter, the last three ratios produce a relatively horizontal line in each case, which indicates that the addition of / and S hardly introduce any variation from the standard. In fact, the fifth ratio in the case of MM-population is 100, indicating that the level of fertility is the same after the addition of S (see Table 2).

In applying this methodology, we have chosen as our "standard population" the early maturers (i.e., EM-population) while the midway maturers (MM-population) and late maturers (LM-population) form our study populations. Using the input values given in Table 2, the results of the stepwise standardization are obtained as

2The five ratios are graphed as Figure 1. The graph indicates the behavior of the ratios after the subsequent substitution of the parameters. Thus, on the horizontal scale, 1 represents the substitution of M, 2 represents the substitution of F, 3 represents the substitution of I, and 5 represents the substitution of S. We note that these numbers do not indicate any values of these parameters.

To summarize our McDonald modelbased analysis, we find that the impact of age at last birth dominates the variation in fertility, which is clear from the fact that the slope of the line between F and L is comparatively steep, and it is steeper with respect to LM-population. Had the stopping been necessarily dictated by the onset of physiological infecundity among later maturers, we believe that such a pattern would not have been possible. Further, the overall fecundity is represented by the average length of interlive birth intervals, and primary sterility is represented by the proportion of women with one or more births. The absence of any change following the addition of / and S indicates that these factors do not substantially vary from early puberty to later puberty.
The next analysis is based on Suchindran and Koo's model. An extension of Knodel's (1987) model, it is an exact formulation relating age at last birth to age at first birth, birth intervals of different orders, and PPR's. We also use Das Gupta's decomposition methodology. The input data are provided in Table 3. It may be noted that in this application, PPR0 is to be taken as unity since we restrict our attention to those women who ever have a birth. Further, as age at first birth is one of the factors included, the birth intervals include only inter-live-birth intervals as a set of factors. The results of decomposition are shown for the menarche groups in Table 5. Generally, the results demonstrate that these factors contribute to changes in age at last birth in different ways. As the table shows, age at first birth contributes to increase the group difference in mean age at last birth. In contrast, there is a tendency in PPR's to reduce the difference, while for all practi-

cal purposes inter-live-birth intervals contribute nothing to this difference. Splitting PPR's into earlier and later reveals where the reduction effect is concentrated.
"MM vs. EM" shows the group difference of 0.66 in the age at last birth, which is the total effect as a result of the simultaneous influence of all the five factors. Of this, 0.9 years (or 136 per cent of total effect) can be attributed to age at first birth. In comparison to EM, MM has smaller PPR's. This fact has contributed to the reduction of MM's mean age at last birth by 0.23 years, 39 per cent (or 0.99 years), the remaining 61 per cent (or 0.14) of which is contributed by earlier and later parities respectively. Further, the MM's relatively shorter earlier birth intervals have contributed to a younger age at last birth by 0.01 years. Finally, the higher-order birth intervals have contributed nothing to the group difference in mean age at last birth. Similar comparative analysis is presented in the same table for LM vs. EM. Here, it is observed that the way the five factors contribute to the group difference in mean age at last birth displays, generally, the same pattern as that of MM vs. EM. What needs mentioning, however, is that, of 1.45 years reduction in LM's mean age at last birth, only 17 per cent (0.25 years) is contributed by earlier PPR's, while the remaining 83 per cent (or 1.20 years) is contributed by late PPR's.
To summarize the results of the decomposition, we find that the greatest contribution to the difference in age at last birth between early and late maturers (i.e., midway and late maturers) is the later maturers' ages at first birth. The second contribution is the later maturers' much lower PPR's to the fourth- and

ence of not only age-specific fecundity but also other factors such as delay in consummation, the extent of frequency of intercourse early in marriage, and premarital births, or that midway maturers are more sexually active, or biologically superior, or both, to early maturers.
Further to our McDonald-model-based analysis, we find that the impact of age at last birth dominates the variation in fertility. Had the stopping been necessarily dictated by the onset of physiological infecundity for later maturers, then there would be no apparent reason for the slope of the line between F and L to be the steepest of the slopes. In other words, later maturers would have stopped much earlier than they actually did. Further, the absence of any change in fertility following the addition of / and S (those factors that reflect overall fecundity and primary sterility) indicates that these factors are not substantially variable from early to late puberty.
The second procedure allows us to examine the consequences of simultaneous influence of all five factors on mean age at last birth. This procedure, which has incorporated the variation in inter-livebirth intervals, has confirmed at least two points with respect to the first procedure: that inter-live-birth intervals do not contribute to the differences--in terms of completed fertility or age at last birth-- between menarche groups and that interlive-birth intervals do not change with parity. Further, the bifurcation of parity progression into earlier and later progressions has given insight into how the quantum effect has contributed to the menarche group difference in mean age at last birth. The contribution is highly skewed in the case of LM vs. EM, with earlier PPR's contributing 17 per cent

while the remaining 83 per cent is attributed to later PPR's. In the case of MM vs. EM, the imbalance in contribution is moderate. Here, earlier PPR's contribute 39 per cent, and the rest (i.e., 61 per cent) is attributed to later PPR's.
The absence of effect of inter-livebirth intervals on the menarche-group difference in age at last birth has reduced our task to explaining only the PPR component, the next important factor to age at first birth. What then do higher PPR's for early menarcheal women, in comparison with those of later maturers, suggest in view of the age-at-menarche differential fecundity hypothesis? Do they suggest enduring biological differences between early and late maturers? To answer these questions, a little detour might be required.
Early puberty women marry and also initiate childbearing much earlier in comparison with late maturers (Udry and Cliquet, 1982; Otor, 1995). This process means that at any point of time in the woman's reproductive life, early maturers would tend to have higher numbers of children born to them, or in other words, higher parity. Srinivasan (1967) has noted that parity is primarily the resultant product of two fertility determinants, the fecundability and parity-progression ratios. He argues that the parity of the married woman at any point of time in her reproductive life can be considered as the cumulative effect of the fecundability and parity-progression ratio of the woman in the past. The fecundability of early maturers, we have already seen, has its roots in the sexual motivation which, in turn, is attributed to hormonally-based changes in puberty. In short, early menarcheal women have higher PPR's compared to their counterparts because they tend to be
