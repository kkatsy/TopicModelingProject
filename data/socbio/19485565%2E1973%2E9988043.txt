PTC Tasting and Group Membership Robert Petinga and Edward R. Pierce
Biology Department American University Washington, D.C.

In the June 1970 issue of this journal Turner's brief report "PTC Tasting in Two Social Groups" (Social Biology 17:142) added support to the view that cultural factors, such as social and racial discrimination, can affect the genetic composition of human groups by selective membership criteria. A significant difference between a random student sample and that of a fraternity-sorority sample in taster/ nontaster phenotype ratios was reported and prompted this study which was undertaken to determine if similar selective factors are evident in data collected from a random student sample of state university students and a random sample of private university students.
Volunteer students from large introductory survey courses given at a state university and a private university in the Washington, D.C, metropolitan area were tested for the ability to taste PTC by the 5% paper impregnation technique. Students enrolled in these large courses represented nearly every department on campus and all geographic and local races, although the majority were Caucasians. Thus, we felt these students were representative of the campus population at their respective universities.
The results of the two sets of tests are given in Table 1 and indicate no difference

in state versus private university students in the taster/nontaster phenotype ratios. The relative frequency of each phenotype in both samples is more like that of Europeans (c. 25% to 45%) and American whites (c. 30% to 35%) than like that of American Negroes (c. 9% to 23%), African Negroes (c. 6%) or American Indians (less than 3%). Thus, the selective cultural factors which are operating are of the same order of magnitude in the state and private universities sampled.
At the same time data were collected on the random student samples we tested, members of Greek letter fraternities and sororities were tested in a similar manner in an attempt to confirm Turner's work. The data from these students are given in Table 1. The random student group and fraternity group of the state university do not differ in taster/nontaster phenotype

ratios while the random student group and the fraternity group of the private university do differ significantly in the taster/ nontaster phenotype ratio, but in the direction opposite that which would indicate greater selective membership criteria in the

fraternity group. Thus, neither the state university nor private university comparisons give data consistent with Turner's earlier finding of a significantly higher frequency of nontasters in the fraternity group than in the random student group.
