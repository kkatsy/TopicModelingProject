ABSTRACT: Tay-Sachs disease is a recessively inherited, invariably lethal, degenerative neurological disorder caused by a lack of hexoaminidase-A. It is a hundred times more prevalent among the American-born descendants of the East European Ashkenazim Jews than among any other people in the world. The present retrospective study demonstrates that the currently observed increased gene frequency among these formerly endogamous, highly fecund people is most probably a result of genetic drift. Unique and drastic population contractive and expansion phases are documented to deduce the formation of numerous founder populations which were scattered throughout Eastern Europe by the nineteenth century. The subsequent mass familial migrations to the United States, coupled with the cultural practices of the immigrant generation, greatly enhanced the chances for heterozygote carriers to marry each other. Even if some form of selection were operative in the past, the concatenation of unique cultural events provides convincing evidence for the acceptance of drift as the primary cause for the differential gene frequency.

TSD is inherited as a simple autosomal recessive with complete penetrance, and the affected individual usually dies before five years of age. Heterozygous carriers of the TSD gene appear clinically normal and are currently distinguished only by reduced levels of beta-hexosaminidase A (Okada and O'Brien, 1969).
The TSD gene frequency is ten times higher and the birth incidence of affected individuals is a hundred times greater

Why is the lethal TSD gene frequency so high among the Ashkenazim? Myrianthopoulos and Aronson (1966) have argued that the currently observed gene frequency represents a balanced polymorphism that was established and is maintained by heterozygous advantage. Other workers suggest a transient polymorphism (Workman, 1964) which probably represents the effects of genetic drift (McKusick, 1962; Damon, 1969; Livingstone, 1969; Merrell, 1969; Chase and McKusick, 1972; Fraikor, 1973).

founder individuals composing the ancestral stock of an extant group, as a result of a small group of persons emigrating from a larger group or of a unique contraction in the population which might have been caused by war, famine, disease, or any sociopolitical event; (5) the lineal effect (Neel, 1967; Arends et al., 1967) in which the social structure of a population usually insures that break-away groups contain many related persons so that the group members contain a smaller number of individual independent genomes than the actual number of persons in the group, an effect which is similar to the booster effect of migrating families (Roberts, 1968); and (6) sociocultural practices, such as those that confer reproductive advantages to persons of authority or head men and those that result in the differential fertility of abducted women (Chagnon et al., 1970).

A search of the historical literature revealed all of these factors, both singly and in various combinations.
HISTORY
The destruction of the second temple by the Romans in 70 A.D. resulted in the dispersal of the Jews to various parts of the Roman Empire. Those who migrated to Western Europe became known as Franco-German Jews, and they established the first German Jewish community on record in Cologne in 321 A.D. It was not until the Middle Ages that Jewish scholars used the term "Ashkenaz" to denote German Jews. Throughout their early history, the Ashkenazim were an extremely religious, cohesive, endogamous group who were extremely selective in choosing marriage partners according to the Biblical, Talmudic, and rabbinical precepts.

It is apparent that genetic drift is currently being redefined and extended to include all the human sociocultural forces that are able to influence gene frequencies in human populations (Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971).
METHOD
A retrospective study of historical genetics involves observing the current phenomenon and attempting to discern the most likely sequence of probable causative events. In order to provide convincing evidence for a drift hypothesis, Mryianthopoulos and Aronson (1966, p. 314) have stated that it is necessary to demonstrate: (1) that the Jewish isolates of Europe were composed of very small marriageable populations without social contact with neighboring communities; (2) migration of small groups; (3) famine; and (4) disease or war affecting all or a large number of Jewish communities simultaneously.

Jewish law is very explicit concerning marriage.
Every man is bound to marry a wife in order to get children, and he who fails of this duty is as one who sheds blood, diminishes the image of God, and causes The Divine Presence to depart from Israel. . . . Whoever has no wife rests without blessing; such a one is not called a Man. (Caro, 1S6S, Shulhan Arukh, Ebhen ha-ezer, i. 1).
Marriages were commonly arranged by the parents of young children with the aid of a Shadchen (marriage broker) in accordance with Biblical teachings (Gen. 21 : 21--24:28) which were carefully explained to each family by the rabbi. Selection of a proper wife was deemed so important that the complex arayot (incest) laws contained in the Pentateuch (Lev. 18) were read in public only on Yom Kippur.
A meritorious marriage was between an uncle and a niece. "It is a mitzvah (good act) for a man to marry his sister's daughter or his brother's daughter . . ." (Shulhan Arukh). But marriage between

To further complicate the genetic situation, it appears that polygamy, especially bigamy, was not an uncommon practice (Falk, 1966). Even though there are no Biblical laws prohibiting polygamy (in fact, it was a very common practice among the ancient Hebrews), Rabbi Gershom ben Judah (960-1028) is usually credited with passing an ordinance proscribing polygamy, under penalty oîherem (excommunication), among the Western Jews, i.e., those of northeast France and Germany (Wurmbrand and Roth 1966, p. 122).

community numbered only about fifty persons with very few communities as large as a thousand.
For the convenience of their economic operations, the Jews lived not only in the major towns, but scattered in many hundreds of places which today would not be considered much more than villages. The communities were consequently, on the whole, rather small, for the most part probably not numbering one hundred souls and in very few cases exceeding one thousand (Wurmbrand and Roth, 1966, p. 143).
These estimates include children and postreproductive adults as well as

122

reproducing adults. It is obvious that the effective breeding size of these communities was extremely small. Even if many marriages were contracted between different communities, the effective breeding size of the interbreeding communities within a circumscribed geographical area would still be small.
It seems very possible that the TSD mutation either arose or was already present in one of these Rhineland communities. If so, the combination of polygamy, inbreeding, small effective population size, and large numbers of surviving progeny could result in a large number of TSD hétérozygotes in the population in future generations (Fraikor, 1973). Support for this possibility is provided by studies of the pedigrees of genetic defects in other populations where large numbers of affected descendants can be traced through existing records to a single founder (McKusick et al., 1964; Dean, 1965; Kelly et al, 197S). So long as inbreeding was high, some mutant alíeles would be eliminated by births of affected homozygotes; but reproductive compensation would still enable the gene frequency to increase in an expanding population.
The intolerance accompanying the Crusades which began in 1096 played havoc with the Jewish population. In 1236, Jews became crown property in Germany, and by 1322 all Jews were banished from France while about 140 southern German communities which were populated by about 100,000 persons (Wurmbrand and Roth, 1966) were destroyed.
Many of the 30,000 Jews who escaped extermination fled eastward to Poland and Lithuania as "a disengaged fragment of Central Europe" (Sanders, 1969, p. 16). There was major immigration in the twelfth century to the Kingdom of Poland which at that time encompassed an area

from the Baltic to the Black Sea. From 1264 to the late 1300's, Jews in the kingdom were protected from persecution (Wurmbrand and Roth, 1966, p. 226).
The presence of Jews in Lithuania was first recorded in 1321, and by the beginning of the fifteenth century there were five established communities: Brest, Grodno, Troky, Lutzk, and Vladimer. Doubnow(1929, p. 169) writes, "The Jews of Lithuania, unlike their western brethren, engaged not only in commerce and industry, but in agriculture as well." Jews were expelled from Lithuania in 1495 but allowed to return in 1501. As Jews settled in many foreign lands, it was not uncommon to restrict their movements and then later to expel them for a time only to allow them to return again. During this period of geographical relocation, the Jews were traveling in small groups. Some returned to Western Europe, and others settled in nonrestricted areas of Eastern Europe.
The historical accounts are supported by linguistic evidence. Herzog (Chase and McKusick, 1972, p. 339) has suggested that the East European Jews must have originated from the German Jews who were previously organized into isolated bands living in the Rhineland. He further states that the migration to the East "probably took place in small bands which had been seminomadic for many years before reestablishing permanent settlements."
It is an anthropological fact that seminomadic bands do not usually experience rapid population expansion, and Figure 2 clearly shows that the total Jewish population experienced relatively little growth during this period. However, it is imperative to remember that this total population was composed of numerous small bands of persons which rarely numbered as many as fifty individuals. Additionally, since ancient times, the

LIFE IN EASTERN EUROPE
By the sixteenth century, Jewish communities or individual Jews could be found in almost every village and town from the Vistula to the Dnieper. While the former great communities in the West were decimated and impoverished, Polish communities such as Cracow, Lublin, and Poznan became world-renowned centers

for Jewish scholarship (Keller 1966, p. 278). Indeed, this time period has been labeled the "Golden Age" for Jews in Poland and Lithuania (Doubnow, 1929). Great centers of learning were established, and the settled population experienced phenomenal growth, both from their high fecundity and the constant migration into the region by Western European Jews (Weinryb, 1972, p. 317).
It seems likely that the average inbreeding coefficient (Bernstein, 1930) decreased

during this time. The large expanding population size would result in less inbreeding, especially since migration within the-territory was possible, and the establishment of large Jewish educational centers in major cities enabled the resident Talmudic students and scholars to meet a greater number of marriageable women. The genetic effect of this situation was to increase the number of hétérozygotes in the total population without eliminating the TSD alíele by births of affected homozygotes. The literacy level of the entire Jewish population was also increased, which facilitated the development of more cosmopolitan social attitudes (Keller, 1966; Weinryb 1972, p. 317).
The Golden Age lasted for less than one hundred and fifty years. After reaching a total population size of about half a million (Keller, 1966), the East European Jewish population was subjected to a continuous series of pogroms, massacres, wars, famine, and plague which ruined Polish Jewry by the mid-eighteenth century (Doubnow 1929; Schwarz 19S1; Wurmbrand and Roth 1966; Keller 1966).
The Cossack Massacre of 1648 was a massacre of the Jewish population "on a scale that had no parallel in Europe, at least since the Black Death massacres in Germany, precisely 300 years before" (Wurmbrand and Roth, 1966, p. 290). The Cossacks roamed the countryside, forcing many Jews to flee from the smaller towns and villages to the fortified cities. As word spread of these brutalities, a mass flight began. "Wild with fear, vast numbers of Jews rushed from town to town whenever the approach of Cossack hordes was reported. . . . In the resulting confusion many women and men lost their children" (emphasis mine; Keller, 1966, p. 305) who, if they managed to survive, were raised by compassionate coreligionists.
Many Jews survived the effects of the Chmielnicki Uprising by hiding or by

temporary conversion to Christianity and later reversion to Judaism or by temporarily settling in border regions, e.g., Silesia. As Weinryb (1972, p. 318) states:
A reasonable estimate would apparently be that the total loss of life did not exceed forty to fifty thousand people--despite the historian's far higher exaggerated estimates. Such a figure would be high enough, representing a loss of 20-25 per cent of the existing Jewish population of PolandLithuania on the eve of the Chmielnicki Uprising.
The loss in the Ukraine was far greater. Over 770 communities were all but annihilated, resulting in the loss of nine-tenths of the population (Rabinowicz, 1965, p. 23).
Following on the heels of the Cossack Massacre came the Muscovite attacks which began in 1654. The Jews in Mohilev-on-the-Dnieper were slaughtered; in Vilna, they fled from the city, and those who did not were either killed or forcibly expelled (Doubnow, 1929, p. 256). Meanwhile, on the northern border, Sweden invaded Poland. The Jews were accused of bribing the Swedes to leave them alone. The Swedes allegedly complied with their request, thereby causing the Poles to accuse the Jews of aiding the enemy, which resulted in the Poles slaughtering the Jewish "traitors" (Wurmbrand and Roth, 1966, p. 290).
Concurrent with the Muscovite massacres in the South and massacres precipitated by the Swedish War in the north was the reappearance of the plague in 1655-58 which struck relentlessly in Cracow (and its Jewish ghetto, Kasimerzh), Posen, Lublin, and Kalish.
The Jewish communities "disappeared completely in the Russian Ukraine. In the Polish Ukraine, only one-tenth of the former Jewish population remained" (Doubnow, 1929, p. 256). "The result was the ruin of Polish Jewry which was heavily reduced in numbers and completely im-

contained inducements in the form of vacant land on the steppes of New Russia to encourage Jewish farming. By 1810, eight agricultural colonies were established in the Kherson province with a total of six hundred families and by the 186o's, about eight thousand Jews were farming in Russia. Additional colonization came to a halt when "by order of another ukase by Alexander II, Jews were no longer allowed to settle in agricultural colonies after 1866 because Southern Russia 'no longer needed artificial colonization' " (Dubnow, 1918, p. 197).

For boys older than nine, there was the additional complication of leaving their wives. By 1834, marriages between tenyear-olds were very common and could be found in every city. To spare their wives a life of widowhood, many recruits divorced them before entering the military (Dubnow, 1918, p. 28).
In addition, and intimately related to the compulsory draft law, two ukases passed in 1827 brought additional hardships on the Jews. The ukase of December 2 decreed the immediate transfer of Jews still living in villages in the government of

that bound the Jews together. The second relevant ukase banished all Jews from the city of Kiev followed by Sevastopol, Nicholayev, Courland, and Livonia. The result was that between 1827 and 1830, the "Jews moved around like cattle from village to town, city to city, province to province" (Dubnow, 1918, p. 30).

Roth, 1966, p. 365), of the total Pale population and the majority of them continued to practice religious endogamy and to resist passively all Russianization (i.e., assimilation) programs. This resistance was an important element in their subsequent expulsion from the Baltic provinces in 1843.

The Jewish situation in the Kingdom of Poland also took a turn for the worse. Between 1815 and 1830, Poland was an autonomous Russian province which allowed its Jewish population of about four thousand persons to govern itself upon payment of special "Jew taxes." However, the unsuccessful November Insurrection of 1830, which broke out in Warsaw, to regain complete freedom from Russia resulted in Poland being placed under the direct rule of a Russian viceroy and the Jews being placed under increasingly restrictive Russian rule.

Apparently, rigid endogamy among religious Polish Jews is still continuing today. Tsafrir and Halbrecht (1972) found that "the highest rate of endopatric marriages (in Israel) were contracted among people of Polish and Roumanian origin." Furthermore, they also found that the rate of outbreeding in a community is inversely proportional to the relative representation of that community in the population. Hence, being a persecuted minority group in the larger Pale population probably tended to further increase the withingroup solidarity of the Jews.

By the middle of the nineteenth century, the Jews were being forced from all the villages into the towns and cities within the Pale of Settlement, which resulted in the formation of larger-sized Jewish communities. In the towns, Jews usually constituted 30 to 80 per cent of the population (Wurmbrand and Roth, 1966, p. 365). As the people were herded into the cities, they congregated with existing residents whose religious and political beliefs were compatible, so that many marriage partners originated from different towns and villages within the Pale. This situation is exactly what Myrianthopoulos and Aronson (1966, p. 314) found was true of the great-grandparents and grandparents of the twentieth-century TSD children.
.The reforms of the 1860's intensified the division in Russian Jewry because the assimilationists and socialists, who tended to be members of the intelligentsia, saw Russianization as the only potential means for obtaining equal civil and political rights for the Jews. The vast majority of village and town dwellers, on the other hand, interpreted assimilation as a threat to the continued existence of Judaism itself. They passively resisted Russianization by totally ignoring all inducements offered by the government (Dubnow, 1918). The continual harassment by the Russian government coupled with the cholera epidemic of 1868, Polish famine of 1869, and the isolated pogrom of 1871 in Odessa resulted in about 40,000 Jews (Rischin, 1962), principally from the Polish provinces neighboring the Baltic Sea area (i.e., Kovno and Suwalik), leaving Russia for the United States (Keller, 1966, p. 468).
Aronson (1964) and Myrianthopoulos and Aronson (1972) found that a majority (45 per cent) of the ancestors of the twentieth-century TSD children originated principally from the pre-World War

II Russian-Polish border areas, i.e., the provinces of Grodno, Vilna, Kovno, and Suwalik. Aronson (1964, pp. 140, 143) also noted that a significant number of the ancestors were from the Lithuanian cities of Mariampol (total population in 1902 census: 5,533), Kovno, Lida, Grodno, and Vilna. A glance at the map (Figure 3) will reveal that these cities enclose an area of only about eighty miles and represent the cities that villagers and townspeople were being forced into.
The mass emigration of Russian Jews to the United States, via Western Europe and England, began early in 1881, immediately following the assassination of Alexander II, the great reformer, which precipitated another wave of widespread devastating pogroms against all Jews throughout the Empire.
From a total estimated Russian Jewish population of five million in the beginning of 1881, only three million remained in the Empire by the end of that year. The mass exodus had begun, and a vast majority of the poverty-stricken and destitute (Wurmbrand and Roth, 1966, p. 365) Jews eventually, over a period of several years, emigrated to America.
It was in 1881 that British ophthalmologist Warren Tay first described the characteristic disease picture of TSD.
WHY TSD APPEARED IN AMERICA
Prior to 1881, it is difficult to isolate many cases of TSD from the existing medical literature (Volk, 1964); therefore, it has been concluded (Aronson, 1964) that it must have occurred very infrequently. Indeed, Lasareff (1897, quoted in Aronson, 1964) suggested that it seemed as though the disease waited until the carriers emigrated to America or England before appearing.
It seems highly unlikely that the disease did not appear before the Russian Jews

teen, remained uncounted in olden times and were not even entered in the registers of the burial societies (Weinryb, 1972, p. 320).
According to Baron (1964), the Polish Jewish population increased from four hundred thousand in 1820 to six hundred thousand in 1851 to about one million in 1880. Baron further estimates that the average Jewish birth rate in the early to mid-nineteenth century was about 40 births per 1,000 persons.
Tf th* TSD £p"° "ere already present in the Polish population of 1852 with a birth incidence of 1:6,000 (Myrianthopoulos, 1962), using the estimated number of births for that year (Fraikor, 1973), there would have been only three or four children born with TSD in Poland that year. Since at that time about one-third (approximately 200,000) of the Jews still lived in villages (Schwarz, 1951; Baron, 1964) and since infant deaths were not recorded, it is highly unlikely that these cases would be reported in the medical literature. Additionally, for the most part, doctors were located in cities; villagers, who had a higher birth rate, were usually treated by a feltsher, a semiskilled medical practioner (Kaplan, 1967).
Even as late as 1898 when the total Jewish population in all Russian cities was about 623,000 (Baron, 1964; Landman, 1943), there would have been only some three or four TSD births, assuming a city birth rate of 35.31/1.000 (Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. 10). A doctor may or may not have recognized, much less recorded, the cause of death.
In the United States, the situation was completely different. Most of the earliest East European Jewish immigrants, i.e., those prior to 1881, had been from the provinces of Kovno and Suwalik. According to immigration data (Joseph, 1914), between the years 1886 and 1898, 87.8 per cent of all Russian Jews landed in New

York City. Of these, about 33.8 per cent, or 112,169, were children under 16 years of age. These children represent the parents of the observed TSD children.
If the carrier frequency of TSD were 1:30, there would have been at least 3,738 carriers by 1900. All these carriers were now concentrated in one small section of Manhattan Borough--the Lower East Side--which encompasses an area of about 25 city blocks. The total population of Manhattan Borough in 1900 was 1,850,093 (Delury, World Almanac, 1973) of which about 331,860 were Russian Jews. They represented, therefore, about 18 per cent of the total population, and the endopatric endogamy effect mentioned earlier prevailed.
However, as in the Russian Empire, the Russian Jews were not a homogeneous minority. Rischin (1962) writes:
Practically all East European immigrants arriving after 1870 initially found their way to the Lower East Side (p. 79).... Five major varieties of Jews lived there. Clustered in their separate Jewries, they were set side by side in a pattern suggesting the cultural . . , geography of the old world (p. 76).
And, as Wirth (1956, pp. 204, 224) emphasizes:
The social distances between Roumanian Jews and Hungarian Jews, between Lithuanians and Poles, between Poles and Russians, and between Russians and Galicians are sometimes so great as to make corporate action within the Ghetto almost impossible.
The impoverished Russian Jews turned to each other for both socioeconomic and religious support in the Lower East Side by establishing a new form of mutual aid society called a landstnanshaft. Members of a landsmanshaft were called landsmann, and their religious and political beliefs were so narrowly focused that most

130

landsmanshaften had less than twenty founding members (Doroshkin, 1969).
Furthermore, as impoverished as they were, "every immigrant considered it his duty to save up money for boat fare for relatives remaining in Russia" (Osherovich, 1966, p. 441), and most "Jewish workers managed to save enough money to make at least a down payment on a shifskarte, a steerage ticket to bring their families into the country" (Rich, 1948, p. 401). "It is estimated that more than 80 per cent of the over two million immigrants from Eastern Europe between the early 1880's and 1915 were brought over to America by relatives who had arrived here earlier" (Menés, 1948, p. 339). And once the families were in this country, they became members of the same landsmanshaft. "Not only do the Landsleute belong to the same synagogue, but as a rule, they engage in similar vocations, become partners in business, live in the same neighborhood, and intermarry within their own group" (Wirth, 1956, p. 148).
As in the Old Country, early marriages were the rule among the immigrants. "Parents usually arranged to give away a son or daughter between the ages of 13 and 17" (Sherman, 1948, p. 261) and "among the Orthodox, marriage is arranged by the parents . . ." (Hapgood, 1902, p. 88). Selection of marriage partners was from the eligible persons within the landsmanshaft.
The low intermarriage rate, even between individuals of the diverse East European Jewries, reflected their small-group solidarity. Before 1900, the equipóse between the sexes in each group and a clan-centered social life especially limited contacts (Rischin, 1962, p. 110).

than native-born American Jews (James, 1907). As early as 1889, it was noted (Goldberg, 1948, p. 27) that immigrants averaged 5.6 children while the American-born Jews averaged only 3.6. Goldberg attributes this difference to the fact that immigrant mothers married at earlier ages. "Wives and mothers at 16, at 30, they are 'old' " (Riis, 1902, p. 98).
Therefore, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, first generation immigrant Jewish women were marrying at young ages, having large families, marrying landsmann who were at least distantly related, and producing babies with Tay-Sachs disease.
Even among the non-Orthodox Russian Jews, marriage between distant relatives was probably quite common, even though unknown to them. Those marriages which were not between landsmann were often of an undeterminable degree of consanguinity because many immigrants did not know who their relatives were. Families were often separated during the numerous expulsions from their homes and the nineteenth-century conscription of young Jewish males into the Russian army (Dubnow, 1918; Keller, 1966). To further complicate the situation, immigration officials often changed the difficult-topronounce surnames of immigrants; and, if they did not, teachers in the public school system did. The new names assigned to the children were often adopted by their parents, especially if the father were a businessman (New York Tribune, July 3, 1898, quoted in Schoener, 1967, p. 122). Hence, many immigrants did not know many of their relatives.
SUMMARY

The carrier frequency for TSD was Furthermore, immigrant families were probably already significant in Russia in producing greater numbers of children the nineteenth century because the origi-

nal mutant carrier was probably already present in the German population prior to their forced migration to the East. The combination of polygamy, inbreeding, small effective population size, and large numbers of progeny could have elevated the frequency of the TSD alíele in the descendants of those populations. The subsequent period of seminomadism resulted in numerous individual carriers being scattered in many parts of Eastern Europe. Some carriers probably also remained in Germany or Western Europe.
During the Golden Age of the sixteenth century, the rapid population expansion and freedom of migration within the territory of Poland greatly enhanced the chances for carriers to marry noncarriers. Such marriages would further increase the number of carriers in the total population, and selection against the gene would be reduced because affected homozygotes were not being produced in significant numbers.
When confined within the boundaries of the Pale of Settlement, the Jews expelled from their villages were forced to live in towns and cities where they banded together in shtetl communities. Shtetl membership was based on similar religious and political beliefs, and marriages were arranged by parents from among their neighbors. This compressing of the living area for the Jewish population had the effect of bringing formerly geographically scattered carriers into close physical proximity. Hence, marriages were arranged between persons who recorded birthplaces from all parts of Eastern Europe. Most of the Jews were destitute and unable to afford the services of a real doctor, and infant deaths were still an accepted fact of their harsh lives. Additionally, the disease had not yet been characterized.
Soon the mass migration to America

began. Because not everyone was able to emigrate, arrival in New York City resulted in the formation of groups even smaller than the shtetl--the landsmanshaften. Landsmann helped finance the emigration of their relatives still in Russia. Since most of the pre-1881 East European immigrants originated from Kovno and Suwalik, those persons were in a better economic position to secure passage for their relatives, many of whom were also carriers of the TSD gene because of the lineal and booster effects. There were subsequent waves of Russian Jewish immigration after 1900, and the immigrants all swarmed to their landsmann for initial aid.
The Russian Jews were now crowded in a small section of Manhattan, the Lower East Side, an even smaller geographical area than the Pale of Settlement. Landsmann intermarried, infant deaths were no longer acceptable, and the births of TSD children were soon noted. Thus, it seemed as though the disease waited until the carriers emigrated to America or England before appearing.
The reason that a high frequency of TSD has not been reported from the mother-areas of the immigrants is probably due to the familial nature of Jewish immigration (Joseph, 1914). As suggested by Aronson (1964) as being "remotely conceivable," most of the carriers did happen to emigrate to either America or England. The result is exactly what would be expected from the booster effect in immigrant families.
To further eliminate the chance that numerous carriers would marry in the Old Country, the tragic events of the world wars must be considered. World War II alone reduced the remaining Polish and Lithuanian Jewish populations by more than 85 to 95 per cent respectively (Finkelstein, 1960). Hence, any increase in the

132

incidence of TSD would necessarily be observed in America and Israel.
IS THE TSD GENE INCREASING?
Shaw and Smith (1969) suggested that the TSD gene might be increasing in frequency in the American population. Myrianthopoulos et al. (1970) have commented that "there is nothing to support the notion that hétérozygotes have greater fitness in North America, Britain or Israel."
It seems unlikely that the gene frequency will increase, but for reasons other than a presumed relaxed selection for the hétérozygote. If the current trends toward increasing intermarriage (Lestchinsky, 1948; Warach, 1970), decreasing consanguinity (Klein, 1967), and reduced family size (Shapiro, 1970) continue among the Ashkenazim, the TSD gene will become diluted in the general population. Furthermore, a stable population, i.e., one in which each marriage produces only two

children, will increase the probability of extinction of the TSD gene. Also, there are now genetic counseling clinics to which marrying coreligionists may go to be tested for heterozygosity. Therefore, modern prophylactic medicine and amniocentesis should help to prevent the birth of TSD children, and the accompanying heartbreak for parents, and could reduce the frequency of the TSD gene in the Ashkenazim population.
