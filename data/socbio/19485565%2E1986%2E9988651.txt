causes of infant death. Some of the very same factors, such as infection or colonization by microorganisms, when occurring after birth, are called "exogeneous" causes of death. Whether occurring to the mother, and through her to the fetus before birth, or occurring directly to the baby after birth, many causes of infant death are environmental and theoretically modifiable.

The crucial question may not be should we define neonatal death as death occurring by day 18 or by day 28, but should we not just reformulate but also reconceptualize the definition of neonatal mortality; and then, how do we muster our knowledge and resources to avert the many infant deaths over which, in some sense, we could exercise control?

We agree with many of Geronimus' comments (1986) and welcome the opportunity to clarify our stance and to further the general conceptual treatment of neonatal mortality. While our initial focus was empirical (Poston and Rogers, 1985) and Geronimus' comment (1986) is theoretical, we would like to extend these ideas to a more practical level.

Because the focus of our paper was to determine the accuracy of neonatal and postneonatal mortality rates as proxies of endogenous and exogenous causes of death, we maintained the endogenous/ exogenous distinction. Our results suggest that endogenous and exogenous mortality rates are more accurate and impart more information than neonatal
