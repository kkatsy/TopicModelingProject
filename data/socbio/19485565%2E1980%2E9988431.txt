ABSTRACT:An index which provides a measure of abrupt or sudden change in epidemic trends is provided. Using this index, a simple comparison of the epidemiology of deaths due to homicides, suicides, motor vehicle accidents, and other accidents is made. One example of the findings is that the trend in accidental deaths over recent years possesses more spontaneity or temporal clustering than the trend in violent nonaccidental deaths. Another application reveals an informative epidemiologic feature of the birth defects tracheoesophageal fistula and esophageal atresia. Implications of such findings are considered.

In recent years much effort has been given to developing methods for identifying or testing for patterns (mainly clusters) of disease in space and/or time. Little attention has been given to the development of measures for the amount of clustering, to the development of operational definitions of "cluster," or to methods of depicting distinct types of what are loosely referred to as disease clusters. These matters are fundamentally distinct from cluster-testing approaches. The lack of these measures is a serious drawback in that epidemiologists and sociologists are limited in what they can deduce about patterns from data.
This paper introduces new ways of thinking about epidemiologic processes, patterns, and trends and introduces a new index, a type of standardized mortality ratio (SMR) that requires no external controls in its application as does the familiar SMR. It is applied in this paper to measure "suddenness" or abrupt behavior of epidemiological or sociological phenomena.

CLUSTERS AND SUDDENNESS
A cluster of people with a given disease may be identified in a variety of ways. For example, an observer may note that in a particular location over a number of years between zero and ten people acquired a particular disease each year, but during the past year fifty people acquired it. An abrupt change in the trend has occurred. As another example, perhaps an investigator has noted that for most counties the annual rate of a disease is two or three per hundred thousand population but that one county consistently has a rate of one hundred per hundred thousand population: Again a cluster is identified. This is a cluster in space. From these examples, one may easily imagine various hybrids of these phenomena.
However, any measurement of, or even acknowledgement of, the existence or nonexistence of a cluster depends on the geographic and temporal scale of the recorded measurements. For example, a

large dense urban area that experiences several outbreaks of some bacterial infection each year may be resigned to a fairly constant (endemic) annual rate. However, if one section of the city of this urban area, in "monitoring',' only itself over the years, experiences one or more severe outbreaks, then the residents of that section would certainly register alarm. Yet, from the perspective of even a smaller area such as a block within the above section, the experience of a sudden change in epidemicity may not be as severe. The sudden changeispeculiar to the intermediate area, the section. By envisioning epidemicity via flexible spatial scale, one may characterize epidemiologic properties of the disease.
Such characterization also depends on the temporal scale. If the constant annual rate of an entire urban area is interrupted by a large number of outbreaks or by one or two unusually large outbreaks in one year, then that urban population experiences a cluster or peak of incidence in that year. However, suppose that no seasonal pattern for this disease exists and that several outbreaks occur more or less randomly over the months throughout the above year, resulting in the high annual incidence. If the population changes itstime scalefrom a year to a month and, further, if it monitors the incidence pattern on a monthly basis only for those twelve months, it would then experience no sudden change in trend.
The above illustrations suggest a need for refinement of some of our notions of "cluster." In this paper, the term "cluster" and its implied concept are reexamined, and an epidemiologic attribute termed "suddenness" (nearly synonymous with surprise, abruptness, spontaneity) is introduced. Suddenness is a special type of cluster. Informally, suddenness is the unexpected occurrence of a large number of events (e.g., cases) within a given

period of time, relative to smaller amounts occurring within similar periods of time preceding and perhaps following the period of the large number. This is in contrast with familiar epidemiologic processes such as cyclic behavior and increasing trends. For example, if eight years of incidence data in one geographic area of a fairly stable population are 5,0,3,2,3,17, 2, 2, then a pattern of suddenness is suspected because of the aberrant number of 17 cases in a single year. A more rigorous definition of suddenness is presented in the next section.
The concept of suddenness requires a measure, of course. The interesting new feature here is that this measurable property of epidemicity depends on the geographic and temporal units. The scales in the analytical method to be described are regarded as variables. They are parameters that can be adjusted in order to determine the space-time (S-T) structure that registers the most suddenness. (A term like "suddenness" or "surprise" is amenable to the concept; a real-population epidemiologic experience is registered and reflected in such a term.)
An important observation offered here is that nonrandom disease occurrences have characteristic S-T scale adjustments for which suddenness is at a maximum, and that this maximum is measurable. Furthermore, diseases may be classified in terms of suddenness measures, possibly providing a useful epidemiologic taxonomy.
CLUSTER MODULUS
Consider a hypothetical county which has had a fairly consistent demographic composition over many years and has experienced little migration. Suppose that the incidence of a disease in this county over the last fifteen years is as follows: 3, 6,19,4, 3, 5,5, 5, 20, 5,2, 3,17,7,1. Be-

We propose the following internally standardized mortality (or morbidity) ratio:

This index is the ratio of the observed maximum annual incidence in the units to the expected maximum under random occurrence. It may be interpreted as the ratio of the average of the observed maxima to the average of the expected (random) maxima. Recall that the expected maxima are obtained by the multinomial (occupancy) distribution, given k and the unit totals. They are not based on an external population source as is the case in the usual SMR calculations. This SMR provides a measure of the amount that the incidence exceeds what is expected during

the peak or epidemic year (or any other time unit).
Note that the analysis avoids the use of rates. It pertains to numerators and is used wherever population bases are regarded as fairly stable over short periods of time (see Ederer et al., 1964, or Grimson, 1979a, for elaboration on this point). The advantages of this are apparent where population bases which are required for the denominators of rates are either not known or cannot be estimated with adequate accuracy. In the applications which follow, population bases are not known for violent deaths occurring in cities and for the birth defect data.
APPLICATION: VIOLENT DEATHS
North Carolina city (populations of at least 20,000) and county data were collected for the four major sources of violent deaths: suicides, homicides, motor vehicle accidents, and other accidents. Ten years of city data and five years of county (including the cities) data were collected for this analysis (see-Table 1).

occurring in Birmingham (B), England from 1950 through 1955 and in the Newcastle (N) region from 1950 through 1958. Babbott and Ingalls (1961) recorded similar data for Pennsylvania County (P) for the period 1951 through 1958. Birth rates during these time periods were fairly stable so any interesting significant patterns are due to other reasons.

by Knox (1959) and other investigators and is confirmed in this data by the EMM test and the scan test (Wallenstein, 1980). Evidently, the SMR's are typically in the vicinity of 1.5. (The N series could have been partitioned between the " 3 " and the "16" but the results would have been similar.) Such sporadic behavior suggests a careful examination of those years and locations in which the peaks occurred in order to see if any environmental factor is also extreme in these space-time loca-

tions, which, in turn may offer some clues regarding the etiology of these anomalies. In fact, some epidemiologic evidence has been found which suggests that certain infectious diseases incurred by the pregnant woman increase the risk of giving birth to a baby with TF/EA (see Grimson, 19796, and Ozimeketal., 1982).
DISCUSSION
The SMR of this paper provides a practical and meaningful way of measuring abrupt changes in nonrandom incidence over time and of determining the effects of spatial and temporal scale on the patterns of various health conditions. It does not require population enumeration, such as are required of denominators of rates, which is of immense practical value. It is a measure of the number of cases occurring during an epidemic or period (e.g., year) of excessive mortality or morbidity, relative to the maximum number expected if the cases had occurred randomly over the consecutive periods (years).
The calculated value of the SMR depends on the total number of cases in each of the units because £(max) and O(max) depend on these totals; hence it would usually depend on the population sizes of the units. That is, the relative sizes of E(max) and O(max) depend on the total

number of cases, which in turn depends on unit population sizes even though there may be no difference among units in the underlying epidemiologic casual processes of the condition. The SMR, which is a ratio of the sum of the O(max)'s to the sum of the £(max)'s, would change slightly if, for example, one county tripled in population for each year of observation. The total number of cases may increase, so the values of E(max) and O(max) may change in a way for which the SMR would not remain constant. Also, SMR's may vary over geographic areas, racial composition of the units, etc. One may control for such situations by stratification. SMR's may be calculated for various groups and, if desired, a summary SMR may be estimated by taking a weighted average of the component SMR's. One choice of weights is the inverse of the Ederer-Meyers and Mantel (1964) variance for each group. Letting Vj be the variance for the /th group, the adjusted SMR is

those space-time units which experience high numbers of cases. For example, those county-years that produce the large significant O(max)'s could be singled out for special analysis, perhaps utilizing the other county-years as controls. Then a discriminant or case-control analysis may identify county-year factors (e.g., infectious diseases, economic indicators, changes in the industrial profile) that explain the grouping.
