ABSTRACT: The effect of inbreeding on mortality is assessed through genetic load estimates among four caste populations, the Chakali, Kummari, Mangali, and Madiga of Andhra Pradesh, India. The regression coefficient "B" is positive and statistically not significant except in the Mangali where reduced fetal wastage with increased inbreeding coefficient is noted. The B/A values of the majority of populations suggest that the genetic load is mainly segregational. It is suggested that among the Kummari, the load is predominantly mutational for prereproductive mortality. Relatively higher values of intercept "A" are observed in the present study for low socioeconomic caste groups.

The concept of genetic load wasfirst introduced by Muller (1950) as one of the approaches to explain the relationship between inbreeding and some of its presumed effects. Crow (1958) defined genetic load as the relative decrease in the average fitness of a population, with respect to the fitness it would have if all individuals in the population had the genotype that has maximum fitness. Genetic load is a quantity designed to measure the loss of fitness of a population resulting from selection against the deleterious homozygotes (Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971). The load resulting from the loss of zygotes due to mutationselection balance and the load resulting from overdominant loci are referred to as mutational and segregational loads, respectively. Only a few reports on the genetic load among Andhra castes (Srikumari et al., 1985; Rao and Murty, 1990; Reddy, 1992) are available in the literature.

In the present survey, we study the effects of inbreeding on reproductive wastage by estimating genetic load among four endogamous caste populations of Andhra Pradesh, namely, Chakali (washermen), Kummari (potters), Mangali (barbers), and Madiga (cobblers). The former three groups are classified as backward class communities in Andhra Pradesh while Madiga are a scheduled caste population. All the families covered in the present study belong to rural lower socioeconomic strata. The present paper is the outcome of further analysis of demographic data published earlier by Babu and Naidu (1989).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Estimates of genetic load were computed from the data on the reproductive histories of 405 couples belonging to four castes, namely, Chakali, Kummari, Mangali, and Madiga, living in

rural Gokavaram mandal of East Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh, India. The stillbirths and abortions were considered as prenatal loss while deaths up to 15 years of age were recorded under prereproductive mortality. The inbreeding effects in terms of genetic load on fetal loss and prereproductive mortality were estimated by an exponential regression model as illustrated by Rao (1988).
P. = 1 - e-(A + BFi)
where Pt is the expected proportion of survivors and F{ is Wright's coefficient of inbreeding of the ith subgroup based on the type of marriage. Coefficients "A" and "B" were obtained by iterative computational methods. The chisquare tests were performed to test the goodness of fit by considering the values of "A" and "B." The B/A ratio explains the relative influence of mutational and segregational loci in maintaining genetic load. Usually the B/A ratio will be s 10, if the load is predominantly mutational; and approximately 2 if the load is predominantly segregational (Morton et al., 1956).
RESULTS
Estimates of genetic load among the four Andhra caste populations are presented in Table 1. Three caste groups exhibit a positive but nonsignificant regression coefficient "B" for prenatal loss while the Mangali show a negative (--0.1205) value. The results indicate that fetal loss was reduced with an increased inbreeding coefficient among the Mangali which is a deviation from general observation. The B/A values suggest that in most cases the load is mainly segregational. The B/A ratios

are relatively lower for both prenatal and prereproductive mortality among the Chakali which clearly indicates that the load is predominantly segregational. The B/A ratios based on prenatal loss among the Kummari and Mangali also indicate a predominantly segregational load, but among the Madiga the load is mainly mutational. The ratios based on prereproductive mortality indicate that the load is predominantly mutational among the Kummari, while the Mangali and Madiga exhibit segregational load. When the total mortality including prenatal and prereproductive deaths is considered, only the Kummari exhibit a higher B/A value suggesting mutational load. Consistency of segregational load based on both prenatal and prereproductive mortality is observed among the Mangali. The lethal equivalents per gamete lie between "B" and "B + A." The lower and upper limits of lethal equivalents per gamete among present castes range between 0.1 and 3.2 and average around 0.17 and 0.68 respectively. The intercept "A" measures the mortality of the noninbred fraction, which is supposed to be an index of public health condition. The present caste populations record relatively higher values of "A" which is consistent with their low socioeconomic status and poor public health conditions.
A review of literature on the genetic load among Andhra castes reveals negative and nonsignificant "B" values among fishermen castes, the Vadde, Vadabalija, and Jalari (Reddy, 1992), for prenatal loss similar to the observation made in the present study of the Mangali caste. The B/A values suggest a segregational load in the majority of

Andhra castes including the present study populations.
Although various studies are available on inbreeding effects, it is difficult to explain the effect of inbreeding on mortality. It may be that high rates of inbreeding do not always elevate

the level of reproductive wastage as expected in populations, especially among contemporary Andhra populations, due to the elimination of deleterious genes through prolonged consanguinity with very high rates of inbreeding over several generations.
