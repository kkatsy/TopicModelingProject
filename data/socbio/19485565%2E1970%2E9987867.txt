As a preliminary to a broad genetic study of the population of Valparaiso (PintoCisternas and Figueroa, 1967), we thought it necessary to examine the available data on consanguinity. On the basis of these data, we have tried to establish zones with different inbreeding coefficients and have compared the values found with those observed in other regions of Chile and elsewhere. We have also attempted to determine how certain variables--especially social, economic, and cultural ones--influence these coefficients and the frequency of consanguineous marriages in space and time.
The province is located in the central zone of Chile (long. 33°, lat. 71°5') and has a surface of 5,118 sq. km. and a population of 737,355 inhabitants (Geografia Econ6mica de Chile, 1950, 1966). After Santiago, it is Chile's most densely populated province. Valparaiso's topography is very irregular due to the coastal mountains which run from North to South in the eastern part of the province and whose altitude exceeds 2,000 meters at some points. From the main mountain range, smaller hills run transversely toward the coast, leaving valleys in between with steppe characteristics. These valleys have an average altitude of around 200 meters above sea level, with

the exception of the Aconcagua River valley, which is lower and very fertile. These territorial characteristics have made it difficult to build good roads between different points in the province, thus permitting the persistence of geographic isolates.
The high population of the province reflects the presence of the cities of Valparaiso and Vina del Mar, and the existence of other nuclei with populations between 25,000 and 50,000 inhabitants (Quilpue, Quillota, Limache, Villa Alemana, Calera). These centers also account for the predominance of the urban population over the rural one.
Economic activity is mainly commercial. Valparaiso is the principal port of the country and the most important of the South Pacific. There are, however, significant industrial and mining developments and intensive agriculture in the valley of the Aconcagua River.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The data were obtained directly from the files of the diocese of Valparaiso, which registers the dispensations for consanguineous marriages given by the priests of the 55 parishes of the diocese. Catholic canon law requires such dispensations in order to permit marriages between related persons.

and it is formed by mountain ranges600 meters high where there is some mining activity.
Zone IV, the Urban-agricultural Zone, has hada rapid population increase because of its proximity toValparaiso andVifia del Mar. Thealtitude of this zone ranges between 100 and 1,500 meters, and the topography is very irregular. Themajor urban centers aresituated at lower altitudes (100 to 200 meters) and around them extensive agriculture and dryfarming occurs.However, no more than 20% of the soil is under cultivation.
Once the zones were determined, the total data for fifty years were divided into

intervals of five and ten years. For each group wedetermined: (1)total area of the zone; (2) mean population; (3) mean population density; (4)total number ofcivil marriages; (5)number and type of consanguineous marriages; (6) percentage of consanguineous marriages among thetotal number of civil marriages; (7) mean value of endogamy.
To study thebases fordispensations, the data were grouped by decades, considering only two zones (Iand II), two types of marriages (22 and 33), and seven groups of motives (moral, geographic, economic,psychological, social, chronological, and judicial

motives), according to canon law (PintoCisternas and Moroni, 1967).
As other authors have already indicated (Moroni, 1962), the use of ecclesiastic data may lead us to conclusions of limited validity because of the various errors they may incorporate. While the present observations may not be error-free, it seems unlikely that such errors as may exist are sufficiently numerous or important to invalidate the results obtained.
It may be supposed that there are some errors in the total number of consanguineous marriages, as the data were taken from transcriptions which could contain errors due to omission or to the incorrect recording of parish, for example.
The fact that the ecclesiastic and the civil divisions do not coincide exactly introduces an element of approximation as do the interpolations made with the civil data in those instances where the total data could not be used. It must also be noted that the civil division of today derives from a less complex division, thus making necessary calculations according to area, density, and population.
As there are 97 consanguineous marriages that were not registered in parishes but in the jurisdiction of the Castrense vicarage, we decided to distribute them proportionally in space and in time. This fact may have an influence on our findings.
Last, the endogamy coefficients were obtained by establishing a relation between the consanguineous Catholic marriages and the total civil marriages; these values might be somewhat lower than the real ones, because of the possibility of non-Catholic consanguineous marriages. However, since a high percentage of the Chilean population professes the Roman Catholic faith (96% according to the census of 1929, and 91.4% according to the census of 1960), the number of non-Catholic marriages will be so low that they will not significantly influence the total results.

RESULTS
The analysis of the data proceeded in the following manner: (1) analysis of the province considered as a whole and divided into zones; (2) comparison between these data and those of other regions of Chile and of other countries; (3) analysis of the different types of consanguineous marriages; (4) analysis of the bases for dispensations.
Table 1 shows the total population, the number of civil marriages, the nuptial rate, and the number and percentage of consanguineous marriages for each year in the whole province. Figure 2, where the data are shown in the form of percentages based upon moving three-year intervals (Croxton and Cowden, 1965) clearly illustrates the extent of the variation in consanguineous marriages and nuptial rate. Analysis reveals that while the nuptial rate remains relatively constant (excepting the period following the first world war) the number of marriages increases with time, whereas the frequency of consanguineous marriages fluctuates, tending to decrease continuously after 1959. Nevertheless, there are three periods (1917-- 20; 1931-34; 1944-48) which show a remarkable rise in consanguineous marriages and a relative decrease in nuptiality. The causes for this situation, also encountered by other authors (Sutter and Goux, 1962; Tweisselmann, Moreau, and Francois, 1962; Moroni, 1964), may be essentially socioeconomic and reflect a period of war. Although Chile was not involved in either World War I or II, the turmoil elsewhere had an indirect influence, which in concert with the economic crisis of 1930 brought about a fall in nuptiality, caused by the economic restrictions, and a rise in consanguineous marriages which often serve to maintain or even increase a family's economic holdings.
To estimate the degree of heterogeneity of the observed fluctuations in the consanguineous marriages, a chi-square analysis was made, grouping the data by decades

(Table 2); the resulting value of 89.69 is highly significant. Chi-square analysis of each individual decade confirms the heterogeneity in time. The chi-square values are: 1917-26, 47.27; 1927-36, 16.92; 1937-46, 16.08; 1947-56, 8.48; and 1957-66, 27.91.
Table 3 gives the general data, separated by zones and by decades. From their analysis, high values for the rural zone and lower ones for the remaining regions could be deduced. In any case, the high values of endogamy for Zone I I throughout three decades, which can be explained by the

distribution of the types of marriages during these periods, should be noted.
On comparing the relation of population density to the mean value of endogamy based on the data given on the Table 3, it can be observed that only one decade (1927-- 36) shows in all zones the inverse relationship of these two variables as was already indicated by other authors (Freire-Maia, 1957; Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1960; PintoCisternas and Moroni, 1967). Another decade (1937-46) shows almost the same relationship, while the other two decades

This heterogeneity can also be recognized on comparing the observed and estimated number of consanguineous marriages with the total number of marriages. This comparison is given in Table 4.

The chi-square values among the four zones are: Zone I, 69.35; Zone II, 12.98; Zone III, 19.99; and Zone IV, 26.47.
A comparative study discloses in general terms that the heterogeneity is greatest in the zones of highest density. It can also be shown that the chi-square value of Zone I is very similar to that of the whole province; this may be explained by the fact that this zone, the one of highest density, has almost

In general, it should be expected that in the zones of greater density (I and III) the observed number of consanguineous marriages should be lower than the estimated number and that the inverse should occur in the zones of less density (II and IV). Table 4 shows that this does occur in all the zones, with only three exceptions: in Zone I during the first decade, in Zone III during the second decade, and in Zone IV in the fifth

decade. The possible causes may be the high percentage of consanguineous marriages in the first decennial, socioeconomic causes produced by the 1930crisis, and the notable rise of density with a slow breakdown of the geographic isolates.
We thought it necessary to compare the general data of this paper with those given

Thus, zones or regions which might have some similarities with the one here studied were chosen, as it did not seem useful to do so with regions or isolates which show remarkable differences to those of our paper. Table 5 has been constructed in such a way that years and periods correspond exactly to ours. This was feasible because the data

An exception is the 1953-57 period in Nufioa. The data of the province of Valparaiso as a whole, and of Zones II, III, and IV are lower than those of similar regions of Europe, especially Spain, excepting the data in France during the period

1951-55. The only other known data for Zone I are those resulting from a survey of Pinto-Cisternas and Figueroa (1967), who found for marriages contracted between 1940 and 1950, 0.84% of consanguineous marriages with a mean endogamy value of 0.00047. These values are not very different from those mentioned in the present paper.
Utilizing the data of Table 6, Figure 3 shows the distribution of the types of

the whole province, for the reasons already mentioned. At the same time, Zone II is very heterogeneous in the diverse cousin marriages, showing a slightly higher frequency of marriages between second cousins and first cousins once removed than in the other zones. This fact, which also coincides with the data given by other authors (Vails, 1960, 1966), who even indicate that in purely rural zones, the frequency of con-

consanguineous marriages for the whole province and for the most contrasting zones (Urban and Dry-agricultural), when the data are grouped into decades. From the three graphs of this figure, one observes that the highest frequency corresponds to first cousins, then to second cousins, and that the lowest one corresponds to uncle (or aunt) and niece (or nephew) marriages which agrees with the data found in the literature (Tweisselmann, Mourant, and Francois, 1962; Barrai and Moroni, 1965). The figure clearly shows the similarity between Zone I and

sanguineous marriages of Type 33 is the highest of all. The differences between Zones I and II were to be expected, considering the demographic disparity and the different socioeconomic evolution of each one during the last fifty years.
The last analysis was directed toward the reasons for dispensations, in order to determine which factors agree with the distribution of a determined type of consanguineous marriage in a particular region, and thus with the mean values of endogamy. It must be noted that the most efficient way to do

this would be through an analysis of the genealogies of each type of marriage (Barrai, 1961); but this could not be done because the genealogical data available to us were not complete. An analysis of the reasons for dispensation can only be viewed as a first approximation, as the ecclesiastical legislative reasons may not always agree with the

are interesting; in the first and third decade the observed number is lower than the expected, while the inverse occurs during the fifth decade, especially in the urban zone. The number of moral reasons observed is higher than expected, but without predominance of one zone over the others. On theother hand, economic and geographic

real causes determined by the social and biological environment (Pinto-Cisternas and Moroni, 1967.)
For these reasons, the analysis (Table 7) was restricted to a comparison of the observed and expected numbers of reasons for dispensations in only three decades and by distributing these reasons according to their frequency from high to low. The frequency of psychological and judicial reasons

reasons predominate in the rural zone where the observed number is clearly higher than the expected one.
This behavior may stem from the fact that judicial and psychological reasons are given generically as causes for dispensations, while the moral motives used more by urban residents andeconomic and geographic ones used by rural residents reflect causes linked more intimately to the particular

characteristics of an urban or rural population.
CONCLUSIONS
Analysis of the values of endogamy and of the percentage of consanguineous marriages reveal these values to be decreasing with time in the province of Valparaiso as a whole. The same considerations can be applied to each zone of the province. Further, these values are lower in the urban zones than in the rural ones, thus pointing to theurban andrural as the most contrasting zones.
The frequency of consanguineous marriages and the mean endogamy values are very similar to those found by other authors in South America and are in general lower than Europe, especially Spain.
The more frequent type of consanguin-

eous marriages involve first cousins or
second cousins; the lowest values are found
for the multiple type and for marriages
between uncle (or aunt) and niece (or neph-
ew).
Judicial and chronological motives for
dispensation aremore frequent in the urban
zone, while geographic and economic ones
have a higher incidence in the rural zone.
