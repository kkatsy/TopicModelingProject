ABSTRACT:Acculturation theory suggests that contemporary Africa has been experiencing sociocultural changes (opinions, beliefs, values, and so on) because of the impact of Western culture, especially through the exposure to Western eduction. Based on first-hand data on 117 male Nigerian students attending American colleges and universities at the undergraduate level, the issue of abortion is raised in terms of (1) whether these students favor or oppose abortion, and (2) what factors are statistically related to abortion. The analysis of the data indicates that 64.1 per cent of the students are against abortion, 18.8 per cent endorsed abortion, while 17.1 per cent were uncertain. The outcome of varying cross-tabulations and chi-square tests shows that abortion is statistically related to the number and sex of children. It is also revealed that marital status, religious preference, and opinion about the present population of Nigeria are related to abortion.

It is only recently that the question of abortion, taboo for a good many decades, has become a topic worthy of investigation in contemporary Africa. Observational data regarding abortion in the African context are increasingly gathered and analyzed. The purpose of this study is to investigate opinions regarding abortion among male Nigerian undergraduate students attending colleges and universities in the United States. These opinions are examined in relation to the following factors: (1) duration of stay in the United States; (2) opinion about the present population of Nigeria; (3) opinion about children; (4) religious preference; (5) number of children; (6) number of male children; (7) number of female children; (8) Marital status.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data reported here were collected from a larger study carried out among male Nigerian students in the United States. The purpose of the original study was to investigate the fertility attitudes of male Nigerian students who have been exposed to Western education. The section of the questionnaire pertinent to this report dealt with the issue of abortion. The 220 male respondents in the larger study represent a composite of undergraduate and graduate students attending Kansas state taxsupported universities: Emoria State University, Kansas State University, Fort Hays State University, Pittsburg State University, University of Kansas, and Wichita State University. The data

DISCUSSION
In Nigerian society, as in most African states, abortion is frowned upon. Individual opinions are usually consistent with the cultural milieu in which they develop. Wherever this sociocultural milieu condemns abortion, individual members of society tend to oppose abortion. This, however, does not necessarily mean that abortion is not practiced even by those who are restrictive in their views. Many of these individuals would resort to abortion to achieve their own goals. There is enough evidence to support the fact that illegal abortion is frequently practiced in Nigeria in urban areas and rural areas as well. For example, a survey of medical opinion conducted in Nigeria in 1973, revealed that abortion is widely practiced illegally. As Potts et al. (1977, p. 431) observe, "the majority of doctors felt reform would cut the abortion death rate. Most wanted the law to be liberalized, and many believed abortion was more common than any other disease and that doctors commonly operated, usually for a fee of about $25." In any event, illegal abortion is practiced in Nigeria.
IMPLICATIONS
Nigeria is having a population growth rate that is relatively high even within the African context, and yet young Nigerians who are exposed to American

culture, especially liberalized attitudes and laws regarding abortion, tend to condemn abortion. Nonetheless, the fact still remains that there is a discrepancy between their views and opinions and actual behavior. Whether abortion is endorsed or opposed, it is practiced. What is more important in this context is the persistence of such opinions among American-educated Nigerians. It was expected that the stay in the United States and exposure to the American way of life and mainstream culture would contribute to changes in opinion toward acceptance (see for example, Inkeles, 1966; Armer and Youtz, 1971; and Inkeles and Smith, 1974). Thefindings, however, point to the contrary. This fact suggests that despite the exposure to Western culture, particularly through education, initially acquired values and opinions are often preserved. It is important to note that perhaps the exposure of these students has not been long and profound enough to offset the persistence of the original world view among them.
CONCLUSIONS
In spite of the limitations on the size and scope of the study, the authors believe that this study will be useful not only as a guide for future studies, but as a source of information on male opinions concerning the issue of abortion in a male-dominated society. The study ·partly reveals the type of attitudes Nigerian students carry with them to their country. The students in this sample are of special interest for several reasons: (1) University students make up a key group that takes active stands on policy
