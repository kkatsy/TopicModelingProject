ABSTRACT: Geneticists have been able to demonstrate differences in the estimation of degrees of relationship in families as determined by genetic theory and by civil law computations which are based on the ancient concept of "blood lines." Unfortunately, no systematic effort to clarify and resolve these discrepancies has yet been made. This work suggests a method for estimating the genetic relationship of individuals according to a given genetic family diagram and describes the differences between this system and that of civil law in most countries.

tion. This idea supported the blending theory of inheritance for thousands of years until it was disproved by Mendel and declared null hypothesis by the classical demonstration given by Fisher (1918, 1930). Nevertheless, social and legal concepts about marriage and inheritance continue today to be based on an estimate of degrees of relationship between family members derived from the old Roman concept of "blood lines."
In studying inbreeding and consanguinity, geneticists have been able to demonstrate differences in the estimation of degrees of relationship in family as determined by genetic theory (Cavalli-Sforza

CIVIL LAW COMPUTATIONS BASED ON ROMAN LAW
Roman law defined two types of relatives--legal and natural. Legal or "affinal" relatives were those related by marriage. Natural or "consanguineous" relatives were those related by "blood," as the term implies, either through a direct line of descent or descent from a common ancestor. Lineal consanguinity followed the straight line of descent, one person from another. Collateral consanguinity followed branches off the main line, involving persons not descended from one another but with a common ancestor.

of kinship,"fxy, as the probability that a gene taken at random in the propositus X and a gene taken at random in the relative Y will be identical by descent. The inbreeding coefficient fz of an individual is the same as the coefficient of kinship fXY of his parents. Recently, Jacquard (1970) has defined "identity coefficients" according to the identity of pairs of genes in the gametes.
According to all these concepts of population genetics, it is possible to conclude that the correlation between relatives under panmixia is equal to the proportion of identical genes derived from a common ancestor and that, in fact, family members share a pool of genes that are identical by descent and determine the degree of relationship between them.

in common (per cent). Arrows show the flow of identical genes across the generations (Cotterman, 1940; Li, 19SS). This diagram excluded the correlation between sex-linked genes, because they represented a small fraction (5 per cent) of the genome, and the nature of the complex correlations is difficult to show in a twodimensional set. This problem has been studied by Haldane and Moshinsky (1939) and Li (1955).
In this genetic diagram, all so-called "collateral" relatives (sibs, uncles, cousins, nephews) appeared one degree nearer to the proband than when computed with the Roman and civil law computation. This general and wide difference is shown in Figure 2.

A GENETIC FAMILY DIAGRAM

DISCUSSION

The construction of a genetic diagram of the human family to compute degrees of relationship between a proband and relatives was proposed by Cruz-Coke (1974). Figure 3 shows a corrected version of that diagram. It is an autosomal panmictic model containing all possible types of relatives within five overlapping generations and extended to the fifth degree of "collateral" lines. The degrees of relatedness are estimated according to the four yardsticks described previously; the coefficient of relationship (»*y)> the coefficient of inbreeding (fz), the coefficient of kinship UXY), and the proportion of genes

Laws governing marriage between related individuals and inheritance were written before the development of genetic theory during this century and were based on inheritance through "blood lines." Today genetically sound degrees of relationship between family members can be shown following the laws of population genetics, and there is a wide discrepancy between the computations made by civil law and those made through modern genetic knowledge. The time has come when this anachronistic situation should be changed.
It seems reasonable that lawyers, social

scientists, and geneticists could reach an agreement in defining a unified system through which the accurate degrees of relationship of individuals in a family could be computed. Such a system would of course have important consequences in changing present laws about prohibited marriages, inheritance of property, and

even royal succession. However, it would be a vast step forward, in that these laws would have a rational scientific basis rather than being based on archaic concepts. We might do well to recall the master precept of Sir Edward Coke three centuries ago: "Reason is the life of the law."
