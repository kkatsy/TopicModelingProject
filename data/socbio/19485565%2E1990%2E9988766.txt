Harry Lionel Shapiro, curator emeritus of physical anthropology in the Department of Anthropology at The American Museum of Natural History passed away January 7, 1990. Dr. Shapiro was born in Boston, Mass., on March 19, 1902. He graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. degree from Harvard University in 1923, and received a Master's degree from Harvard in 1925 and a Ph.D. degree in 1926.
Dr. Shapiro's major research was in physical anthropology and human biology, including the areas of race mixture and population, and he made important contributions to the public understanding of anthropological theories through his activities in exhibition, teaching, and publication. He conceived and supervised the preparation of the Hall of the Biology of Man, which opened at the Museum in 1961.
His association with the Museum began in 1926 when he was appointed assistant curator in the Department of Anthropology. He became associate curator in 1931 and was chairman and curator of physical anthropology from 1942 until his retirement in 1970.
Before joining the Museum, Dr. Shapiro was a Thaw Fellow and tutor in anthropology. He began teaching at Columbia University in 1938 and was professor of anthropology from 1943 to 1974. As a consultant to the American Graves Registration Command, he went to Europe in 1946 to set up a method for identifying unknown dead that served as a basis for subsequent

identification work in all theaters of war. Dr. Shapiro's field work was exten-
sive. In 1923, when he was unable to get to Pitcairn Island, he undertook a pioneer genetic study of the descendants of the Bounty mutineers (1789) living on Norfolk Island. He reached Pitcairn successfully in 1934 and remained through 1935, completing his study of the race mixture that resulted from marriages between Bounty sailors and Tahitian women. These studies are described in his book The Heritage of theBounty.
In 1927 he did field work in archeology and physical anthropology in the Dominican Republic, and in 1928 in New Mexico. He participated in several population studies dealing with the physical anthropology, race mixtures, and genetics of such areas as Polynesia (1929-30, in cooperation with the Bishop Museum of Hawaii); Point Hope, Alaska (1941); and Puerto Rico (1947-48, a socio-biological study). Dr. Shapiro's research during the 1940's helped lay the foundations for forensic anthropology, and he frequently assisted the New York City medical examiner's office in identifying homicide victims. In 1956 he conducted an American Museum expedition to study the archeology of the Marquesas.
In 1965 Dr. Shapiro made the first of three trips to India at the invitation of the Indian Statistical Institute to establish research programs and studies in human biology with the cooperation of members of its staff. One study concerned the biological responses of man
