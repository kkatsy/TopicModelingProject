ABSTRACT: Utilizing the 1974 Retrospective Survey data and registration data by Cholera Research for 1967-68 and by the Population Growth Experiment for 1962-63, this study attempts to measure infant and child mortality levels in Bangladesh and to determine their structure. The child mortality technique is used to convert proportions dead among children ever born to women in the childbearing ages into conventional life table measures of mortality. Shortcomings of present methods of measuring infant and child mortality in developing populations are discussed.

exact times of rise and fall differ slightly from one area to another or from one study to another. The irregular pattern of proportions dead may be largely due to either age misstatements or underregistration of deaths.
It was assumed, however, that a large proportion of the observed discrepancies between the age composition of the infant deaths was due to errors arising from age misreporting. In the following section an attempt was made to adjust the recorded infant deaths by age by an analytical model developed by Bourgeois-Pichat (19S2).
RESULTS
APPLicATioN OF BOURGEOIS-PICHAT MODEL
TO INFANT MORTALITY BY MONTH OF AGE
According to Bourgeois-Pichat's model, Pn, the probability of death from birth to age n days can be expressed (except apparently in the first month of age) in terms of the following function
_3 Pn - a + b log (n + 1), where a measures endogenous mortality

and b log3 (« + 1), exogenous mortality, The application of the method to both Cholera Research and PGE data is presented in Table 1.
It can be seen from this table that the curve of the adjusted infant mortality rates falls very sharply during the first four weeks and then falls more gradually toward the end of the period. According to the model, the proportion of infant deaths at ages 0 and 1 should be 45.9 and 9.7 respectively. There is therefore a general tendency toward understatements of age of the one-month-olds, resulting in the inflation of the proportion of deaths at age 0 months. However, if the omission of deaths is strongly associated with age, then the distortion of the mortality schedule may be partly attributed to omission errors. This fact is difficult to demonstrate
with the available data, but it is commonly known that a fairly sizeable number of deaths of infants who die immediately after birth are missed,
While it is difficult to draw any meaningful inferences from the data presented

and mortality have not changed recently and that the experience of surviving women is not markedly different from that of those who have died. Changes in fertility are unlikely to have an effect in the estimation. However, shifts in the age pattern of fertility might have an effect in the estimation.
Table 2 reveals that errors in reporting the proportions dead are fully reflected in xq0 values obtained by Brass's technique. Both a priori reasoning and general experience suggest that such errors, consisting chiefly in failures to report past events, do commonly affect such data (Brass, 1968). If dead children and children still alive were underreported by the same percentage, the proportion reported dead would not be affected. However, it is more common to fail to report the births and deaths of the children who have died, particularly if the event took place long before the time of the survey.
It follows that reports of older women might be particularly subject to bias, an expectation that appears to be confirmed by the figures of Table 2, which show proportions dead reported by older women that are somewhat higher than the proportions reported by younger women in the same locations. It should be noted that, whatever their reliability, older women's reports are heavily influenced by the mortality conditions that prevailed

long before the time of the survey. And as noted above, the implausibly low infant mortality rates shown in Table 1 are indicative of incompleteness of reporting on infant deaths. A comparison between the computed /2 values and those estimated from l3 and /5 (Table 3, Cols. 10 and 11) would seem at first sight to indicate an improvement in mortality over time and a slow decline in child mortality.
One would have expected that with the substantial improvements in the health services and medical facilities that have occurred since World War II, the mortality rate should have been declining. It appears therefore that the l3 and ls values have been inflated by the omission of dead children. This omission could be more frequent among the older than the younger women. The /2 values, as implied by observed l3 and ls values, were calculated on the basis of the comparable l3 and/5 values in the Coale-Demeny West model life tables (Coale and Demeny, 1966). The low expectation of life at birth as implied by the Z2 values in the Coale-Demeny West model life tables suggests that mortality level did not improve significantly over the period 1961-74.
Nevertheless, with the exception of lg0 which is highly unreliable for several reasons (Brass et al., 1968), 2q0, 3q0 and 5q0 give reasonable and plausible indications of at least the lower limits of recent levels

of infant and child mortality. Furthermore, general experience has shown that 2q0 is the most reliable of the estimated probabilities of dying (Brass et al. 1968).
Accepting the estimated 2q0 as fairly plausible and also assuming that the relationship between it and the lg0 in the model life tables is the same as that prevailing in the actual population, we estimated a new set of infant mortality rates which is given in Table 4. The basis was the Coale-Demeny West model life tables. Estimates from the North model life tables are also presented. The estimates from the North family models show low infant mortality relative to child mortality, apparently a notable feature of the African and Asian mortality pattern (Brass et al., 1968). The \q0 does not differ significantly, and in some cases the latter exceeds the infant mortality, although some of -the differences may be explained in terms of omission errors and chance fluctuations affecting mortality rates.
Estimates based on the West models are higher than those derived from the North models. The estimates for males in the Dacca and Chittagong regions are too high to be plausible. Similarly, the estimate for urban females is too low to be taken into

consideration. This finding is due to the fact that the estimated l2 values are probably not only biased by omission errors but also by chance fluctuation largely due to the small number of cases. In general, however, the highest infant death rates are found in the Chittagong and Khulna regions with relatively lower rates prevailing in the other regions, except the urban area

which enjoys the lowest infant death rate. The rural infant death rates are generally higher than that of the urban area.
Table 5 shows both recorded and estimated child mortality rates defined as the proportion dying between ages 1 and 4. The estimates derived from both the West and North models are higher than the recorded Aqt values, and in view of the general underreporting of deaths by both the survey and the registration system, the West models appear to be inappropriate for the determination of the levels of child mortality for the population in question. In all the regions, the child mortality rates (based on the 1974 Retrospective Survey data) are remarkably lower than the corresponding North models estimates. It is quite possible that mortality rates of the magnitude recorded in the North family model life tables would indeed operate in areas where the high infant mortality rate is sustained through the second year of life, and even beyond, as a result of malnutrition and infectious diseases. It can be seen from the estimated infant and child mortalities that Bangladesh's mortality pattern is characterized by high child mortality relative to infant mortality, a feature which has also been observed in a number of other developing countries.
The regional child mortality differentials follow the same pattern as revealed by the infant mortality rates and, in general, rural areas are experiencing the highest child mortality levels, while relatively moderate rates operate in the other regions. The survival rates are higher among females than among males.
