Ever since oral steroids came into wide use as contraceptive agents during the 1960's, concern has been voiced occasionally that these compounds might increase the frequency of cancer, particularly of the reproductive organs. Efforts to resolve the issue by experimental work with animals fail to resolve the issue conclusively, mainly because of difficulties in extrapolating findings. Although the human cervix probably provides the most common site for female cancers on a world-wide basis, the disease appears to be species-specific. This problem confounds the plausibility of extrapolation from other species.
The incidence of neoplasms of the cervix varies more by social groups than does any other primary cancer. For example, differentials in rates of cervical neoplasia among ethnic groups within the United States are of greater magnitude than are those differences to which we are accustomed in most sociological research (e.g., suicide and homicide) . Perhaps the most remarkable data on this point comes from a study by

Haenszel and Hillhouse (1969) which compared age-adjusted incidence rates of cervical cancer among Jews, non-Jewish Whites, Blacks, and Puerto Ricans (the respective order of risk). In their study, Puerto Ricans had a 25 times higher risk of cervical cancer than did Jews; Blacks were at four times the risk of non-Jewish Caucasians.
In detailed retrospective studies, at least two variables have emerged as consistently related to differences in relative risks of cervical cancer: age at first coitus and number of coital partners (e.g., Martin, 1966 and 1967; Moghissi et al., 1968). Both variables show different distributions among cancer and noncancer patients.
Use of the pill (rather than other methods) is known to vary with socioeconomic status, ethnicity, age, and parity (Ryder and Westoff, 1966; Dubrow et al., 1969). Women who are undecided about a method of use are most often prescribed pills, and physicians frequently use nonmedical criteria in prescribing contraceptives (Drobyn

et al., 1971; Orr and Terry, 1971). Women of upper socioeconomic levels have been prescribed pills far more often than other women (Measham et al., 1971).
The National Fertility Study and the Princeton Fertility Study found that the coital frequency of both pill and IUD users exceeded that of other contraceptors even when age, race, education, and religion were controlled (Westoff et al., 1969; Westoff et al., 1971). Almost no data are available which compare contraceptors in terms of their age at first coitus, the focus of our data in this paper.
The pill is more popular with young women than with older. Increasing evidence shows that sexual intercourse occurs today at younger ages than was true in the past (Luckey and Nass, 1972; Lundy, 1972; Zelnick and Kantner, 1972). There may or may not be a connection between the widespread dissemination of oral contraception and the progressively lower ages at first coitus. Data from our study (not shown here) indicate a clear age gradient in reported age at first intercourse; the younger women report earlier experience. If oral contraception affects population trends of age at first intercourse and number of coital partners, we might see, over time, a higher rate of cervical neoplasia among pill users due simply to the pill's effects on sexual behavior (Merritt, Balin, et al., 1972).
Thus, any analysis of the association between contraception and cervical neoplasia must take into account nonpharmacologic or social and sexual differences between users of the various methods. In particular, do women who request the use of oral contraception differ noticeably in their age at first coitus from those who choose intrauterine devices, or other methods, or who are undecided? In the remaining portion of this paper we introduce some evidence concerning these questions and evaluate several a posteriori hypotheses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Institute for Survey Research (ISR) at Temple University in Philadelphia has completed the initial interviews and recording of gynecologic examination results for 25,000 American women. The women attend large clinic and group health centers located in nine continental cities and in three cities in Puerto Rico (Merritt, Edington, et al., 1972). At the time this paper was prepared, almost 12,000 patients had been fully enrolled with data completed concerning their contraceptive, sexual, and reproductive history. These data were obtained by a standardized interview coupled with a brief medical history, a pelvic and breast examination, medical chart reviews, and two cytologic specimens. The entire protocol was bih'ngual. Age at first coitus was measured by the patient's report of an estimated month (or season) and year. This question was answered after the complete contraceptive and pregnancy histories were obtained, a method that was adopted after thoroughly pretesting several alternatives for reliability. Actual age at first intercourse was then calculated as the number of elapsed months from month and year of birth to estimated month and year of initial experience.
In order to investigate the relationship between reported age at first coitus (AFC) and years of education, current age, number of previous pregnancies (gravida), choice of contraceptive method (contraceptive pill, IUD, other, and undecided), and ethnicity (North American White, NAW; North American Black, NAB; Puerto Rican, PR; and Mexican American, MA), the analysis of covariance was employed.
RESULTS
As can be seen from analysis of variance results provided in Table 1, years of education and current age each have a significant

effect (p < 0.001) on age at first coitus; their respective regression coefficients are 8.662 and 0.307, indicating a positive relationship. Gravida also is significantly related (/>< 0.001) to AFC; its regression coefficient of --8.422 suggests a negative relationship.
Table 2 shows the mean AFC scores adjusted for educational level, current age, and total number of pregnancies by the ordinary least squares method, while Table 3 gives the mean scores prior to adjustment. Contrasting Tables 2 and 3 reveals the impact of the regression adjustment in each of the subpopulations. It may be noted that adjustments ranged from seventy-eight weeks downward (North American White, Other) to fifty-two weeks upward (Mexican American, IUD). Despite this consid-

erable range, it is clear that interpretations of relative differences in the coital ages of the subpopulations is largely unaffected by adjustment, although as mentioned above each of the covariates was found to be highly significant. The latter finding is not surprising, given a sample size of almost 12,000.
We observe in Table 1 that the mean AFC of 18.6 years for North American Whites (shown in Table 2) differed significantly (p < 0.001) from the mean AFC of 17.5 years for North American Blacks; the mean AFC of 19.8 for Puerto Ricans differed significantly (/»< 0.001) from the mean AFC of 20.2 for Mexican Americans,
The mean AFC of 18.8 years for oral contraceptive choosers differed significantly (p < 0.025), but probably unimportantly,

from the 18.7 years for IUDchoosers. Users of the pill, IUD, and other choosers have been grouped together as those womenwho were initially decided as to a contraceptive method; the mean AFC for this "decided" group differed significantly (p < 0.01) from the mean AFC of 19.2 years for women who were initially undecided on a contraceptive method.
Inspection of the rank order of ethnic groups by AFC within each category of chosen contraception is identical to the marginal order. North American Blacks showed the earliest reported AFC regardless of method selected. However, the marginal distribution of AFC by method does not provide as good a prediction of relative differences between methods within ethnic groups.
The interaction effect between choice of contraception and ethnicity washighly significant (p < 0.001), as can be seen in Table 1. Although we have not subjected the data to detailed orthogonal contrasts for the specific sources of interaction, we can point to some obvious comparisons. The difference between the mean AFC's for NAB and NAW appear to be greater for the undecided group than for the decided group. Also, Mexican Americans who choose the pill reported a lower AFC than

did those who choose an IUD; the other ethnic groups showed an opposite pattern.
DISCUSSION
In 1970, Stern and associates reported that within a group of family planning patients whohad not previously used the pill (other methods may have been used), those who chose the pill had a higher prevalence of cytologic dysplasia at the time of choice than women who chose the intrauterine device, though both groups were apparently similar in demographic characteristics (Stern et al., 1970; also, Stern et al., 1971). Earlier, in 1969,Melamed and associates had presented New York family planning data from which it could be shown that among women just beginning the use of steroids as compared to those beginning use of diaphragms, the former were at greater risk of severe dysplasia and more advanced forms of abnormal cervical cytology (Melamed, 1969). These findings occasioned considerable surprise in the medical community. They suggested that women who selected the pill differed in sexual history from those who selected other methods. However, findings of cytologic atypias at a large Philadelphia clinic failed to support this conclusion (Shulman and Merritt, 1973). Findings of the pres-

ent study for the first time permit direct assessment of coital ages, but also fail to indicate notable differences in this parameter of sexual history.
The differences in AFC between ethnic groups and between certain contraceptivechoice groups has been shown to be statistically significant. It is readily apparent, however, that almost any differences would have proven to besignificant with a sample size of 12,000. One question, then, is whether the small actual differences, e.g., about five weeks overall between the pill and IUD choosers, aresubstantively interesting. We feel that the differences reported here (ignoring ethnic effects) are not likely to be important on biological grounds. Given normal maturation changes in the cervix, the differences would be more notable if they occurred around a mean age of fifteen years rather than around these means of approximately nineteen years. The cervix, and especially the squamo-columnar junction where nearly all the lesions arise, has ordinarily completed itschange in position well before theageof nineteen.
However, it may not besoeasy to ignore the interaction between ethnicity and method selection. For example, the reported average AFC for Blacks, Whites, and Puerto Ricans was 10-16 weeks higher for the pill choosers than for those requesting the IUD. Mexican Americans have a reverse pattern; the average AFC for the IUD choosers was 10 weeks higher than that for the pill group. Thequestion here is whether a positive or negative difference of 10to 16weeks is biologically notable at mean ages of seventeen to twenty years at

initial experience. That is,this 10-16 week difference would clearly be of no significance if the mean age at first coitus took place, say, inthe mid twenties. On the other hand, if the population mean were closer to the average age at menarche (aboutage 13), it clearly would bebiologically significant. We cannot venture a firm conclusion. Among other problems, we do not know whether there are significant differences among racial or ethnic groups in the rate of maturation of the reproductive organs (e.g., onset of menarche).
The few studies known to us that purport to show an unfavorable gradient of risks of cervical cancer among oral contraceptors have utilized largely Black populations. If our findings regarding AFC,ethnicity, and method requested aregeneralizable to the larger population, and to earlier points in time (orcohorts), then there may be some problem in explaining why the small but significant differences should favor theoral users, i.e., be consistent with a slightly lower risk gradient.
Our findings contribute yet more evidence that the epidemiological problems in surveillance of oral contraceptives are exceedingly complex. Population surveillance data provide no evidence to suggest that widespread use of the oral contraceptors in themid-to-late 1960's has been followed by increasing rates of carcinoma in situ in later years (Merritt and Shulman, 197S). Most epidemiological research has failed to reveal significant restrospective associations between oral contraceptive use andabnormal cervical cytology, and the present results are consistent with this pattern.
