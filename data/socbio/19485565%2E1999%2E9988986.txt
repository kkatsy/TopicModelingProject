ABSTRACT: This study deals with models and hypotheses that attempt to explain the underlying mechanisms determining the sex ratios at birth in human populations. Since the factors responsible are still questionable and research results are contradictory, we examine data available in Israel on the sex ratios at birth among two different sociodemographic groups, Jews and Moslems. Results suggest a difference between Jewish and Moslem patterns of secondary sex ratios with respect to parental age, education, and birth number. The difference may be described as a more regular and, by existing models, a more predictable pattern of secondary sex ratio among Moslems than among Jews. The possibility that Jewish religious laws play a role in this difference is discussed.

The sex ratio--the number of males per hundred females in the population-- is one of the most basic demographic characteristics. Nowadays, when mortality is usually low, the sex ratio of the population depends heavily on its initial values, i.e., the sex ratios of newborns. The sex ratio among newborns, known as the birth-sex ratio or the secondary sex ratio, usually stands at about 105 males to every 100 females, but different population groups show varying fluctuations over time. It is common to use the term "proportion of males among newborn" as a substitute for "sex ratio," but the latter expression is still in use (Ulizzi and Zonta, 1995). The fluctuations of secondary sex ratios can be very small, usually only a tenth of a per cent. The social consequences of a bias of such magnitude is difficult to analyze and to foresee, but in a period when chaos theory has attained such wide recognition, we cannot neglect the possible implications of very small changes in population sex ratios.

DETERMINANTS OF THE SECONDARY SEX RATIO
The range of results of numerous studies on models and hypotheses that attempt to explain the underlying mechanism determining sex ratios at birth in human populations is analyzed by James (1987a, b) and Chachnazarian (1988).
Broadly speaking, there are two sets of conditions for the development of sex ratios at birth: underlying biological determinants and intervening sociodemographic factors.
Biological determinants that have been argued to affect the birth-sex ratio are coital frequency, genetic factors, women's hormonal levels upon conception and during pregnancy, and the timing of fertilization during the fertile period. High sex ratios may result from conception either early or late in the menstrual cycle relative to the time of ovulation (James, 1987a). Among the biological correlates, the hand-dominance of parents has been

claimed to play a role, the chances of having a son being higher when both parents are right-handed (James 1987fc). Character traits of the parents have also been proposed to determine the sex ratios, with more dominant mothers reported to have a larger proportion of sons (Grant, 1996).
Sociodemographic factors which in some populations are associated with statistically significant differences in human sex ratios at birth are maternal and paternal age (higher age is associated with a lower sex ratio), birth order (later-born children tend to be female), and social class (lower sex ratios among lower social classes) (James, 1987a, b; Chachnazarian, 1988).
Secondary sex ratios in human populations may depend on environmental factors such as levels of nutrition, because low nutrition reportedly diminishes the secondary sex ratio (Williams and Gloster, 1992), and war, because the sex ratio of newborns rises during and immediately after wartime. Another additional factor in determining secondary sex ratios may be smoking--the sex ratio is lower among offspring of smoking women (James 1987&), a factor that may be classified as both social and biological because of the correlation between smoking and social strata.
The purpose of this study is to analyze the role of some of these intermediate sociodemographic factors in the formation of secondary sex ratios in populations. Data available from the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics provide an opportunity to examine sex ratios at birth among two different sociodemographic groups in Israel, Jews and Moslems. It is of interest to compare these two geographically contiguous population groups in the context

of a secondary sex ratio analysis because the groups' different forms of social, religious, and political organization may lead to different levels of secondary sex ratio. This effect may be the result of different forms of sexual behavior and psychological factors conditioned by social status. Our general hypothesis is that a difference will be found in the secondary sex ratios of Jews and Moslems in Israel.
At the end of 1995, Israel had a Jewish population of 4,549,500, 16.7 per cent of whom lived in urban localities with populations of less than 10,000 or in rural areas. The country's Moslem population was 813,000, 45.2 per cent of whom resided in small urban or rural localities. Among the Jews, 21.6 per cent lived in urban localities with populations greater than 200,000, as against 21.7 per cent of Moslems, most of whom lived in East Jerusalem. The economic, political, religious, and social conditions of these two populations are perceptibly different. In their labor-force characteristics, these groups differ mostly in the participation rate of women: 49.9 per cent among Jewish women and 12.5 per cent among Moslem women. The percentage of males in the labor force was closer between both groups: 61.9 per cent among Jews and 67.4 per cent among Moslems. Moslem households obviously had lower incomes than Jewish ones because the average gross monthly income of nonJewish households was NIS 3,936.3 as against NIS 6,185.3 among Jewish households. Separate data for Moslem households were not published (Income of Households, 1995). Average housing density (persons per room) in 1995 was 0.98 among Jews and 1.76 among Moslems. The poorer social conditions of the Moslem population, as expressed in such

indicators, and their lower sex ratio at birth, coincide with the presumed correspondence between social status and secondary sex ratio. In 1994, infant mortality rates among Moslems were twice as high as those of Jews--13.0 and 6.3 per thousand, respectively. There was no striking difference in life expectancy.
Changes in fertility between 1981 and 1995 may be also associated with a change of the secondary sex ratio. The total fertility rate of Israeli Moslems was approximately 5.5 in the 1980's and dropped to 4.7 in the mid-1990's. The total fertility rate of Jews fell from about 2.8 to 2.5 during this time. Among Moslems, the proportion of first-born among all births increased from 18.2 per cent in 1980 to 23.0 per cent in 1995, while among Jews the fraction decreased slightly in the same period--from 31.8 per cent to 29.2 per cent. In 1994, the difference between the ages of groom and bride upon first marriage was higher among Moslems (3.9 years) than among Jews (2.6 years). The age upon first marriage rose somewhat between 1980 and 1994--by about half a year--among both populations. Thus far, fewer young unmarried Moslem adults than Jewish adults live alone, especially among young women (Goldscheider, 1992). Such differences may modify the secondary sex ratio and depend on a variety of factors to be described later.
In 1995, Jewish women submitted 15,305 applications for termination of pregnancy and Moslem women submitted 863; the rates per 1,000 women were 14.3 and 4.7, respectively (Central Statistics Bureau, 1998). The differences in rates were more pronounced in younger ages (18-19) at 18.9 and 1.7, respectively. The number of illegal abortions in Israel was

estimated in the 1980s at about 6,000 per year (Sabatello, 1990).
Data on the use of contraceptives in Israel are very scarce. A survey performed in 1987-1988, in which 1,751 currently married Jewish women aged 22-39 were polled, showed that 68 per cent of them used some contraceptive. Among the contraceptive users, 63 per cent used an IUD or "the pill" as their main choice (Okun, 1997). Less is known about several specific groups in the Jewish population, especially strictly Orthodox Jews, and little is known about Moslem women. According to findings in the mid-1970s, Israeli Moslems were still in the early stages of family planning and lagged behind their Jewish counterparts in Israel (Eisenbach, 1986). Another survey was performed in 1987 (Keisar et al., 1992) but the results concerning use of contraceptives by Moslem women have not yet been published, except for a note stating such use among the women in the Moslem community in Israel is increasing (Peritz, 1992). Another study, carried out in four Moslem villages in the northern and central districts of Israel in 1988-1989, included 429 females of fertile age who had given birth (Azaiza, 1996). Its results show that 34 per cent of the respondents used no contraceptive at time of the survey, 28 per cent used traditional methods, and 37 per cent used modern devices ("the pill," IUD). Comparing these findings with the survey of 1987-1988 years, we found that the use of modern contraceptives among contraceptive users was 56 and 63 per cent among Moslem and Jewish married couples, respectively. It must be borne in mind that the study of the four Moslem villages included only women who had given birth and excluded Bedouin women from the south, while

36 Riis Social Biology

the study of the Jewish population included all married women including those currently pregnant. Thus, one must be cautious when comparing the two population groups. Furthermore, because the survey embraced only specific subpopulations, the rates of contraceptive use among all married Moslem women in Israel are probably lower that those presented in this survey. Evidently, the gap in contraceptive use between Jewish and Moslem women has decreased over the past two decades.
DATA
The birth files at the Central Bureau of Statistics contain individual information regarding approximately 100,000 births per year. This paper presents the analysis results of about 1,500,000 births in Israel during the years 1980-1995. The data may differ slightly from previously published official statistics because of postpublication corrections. The sex ratio, or more exactly the proportion of male births among the total number of newborns, was investigated for this period. To achieve statistical significance in comparisons of very small differences in sex ratios, vast quantities of data are needed-- as large as 500,000 cases for each group (James, 1994). One doubts that such data will become available in the foreseeable future for the population groups under consideration. Therefore, we can not determine any statistical significance for a difference in sex ratios between the groups; the results should be regarded as suggestive only.
RESULTS
The dynamics of the sex ratio at birth for Moslems and Jews throughout the period are shown in Table 1. The mean sec-

ondary sex ratio of Jewish births in the period reviewed was slightly higher than that of Moslem births, at 51.39 and 51.36, respectively, but this difference is not statistically significant. The secondary sex ratios were more stable for Jewish births than for Moslem births (Fig. 1). This dissimilarity may originate in the smaller number of Moslem births, which made their secondary sex ratios more susceptible to random fluctuations.
The births were classified by maternal religion, years of schooling, parental age, and order of birth. Legitimate and illegitimate births were not considered separately. The secondary sex ratio for illegitimate births is usually lower, but since Israel has a low percentage of such births, this variable should not significantly modify the overall results.
Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed, mainly to examine and estimate dependencies between the secondary sex ratio and available explanatory variables. Since the dependent variable-- the sex of newborn--is dichotomous and our goal is to estimate probabilities, the analysis is performed by building logistic regressions. The models evaluate the likelihood of the birth of a male child for each of the defined categories in each religious group. The data are also presented in two-way tables for which statistics were computed using SAS software (Stokes et al., 1995). The totals in Tables 2-5 and 6-8 are not equal because of different numbers of missing values in the variables examined. Since only the results of univariate analysis are presented in this paper, we preferred to perform the analysis on the maximum possible number of valid cases for each variable.
We start the analysis with the only socioeconomic variable available in the data

ratio in the Jewish population tended to rise commensurate with maternal education, and the effect was even stronger among the Moslems. Paternal education had a similar effect. It seems that the effect of level of education becomes clear only when a large difference in educational level exists within the population group. Such a difference indeed exists in the case of the Moslem population, which contains many persons with fewer than five years of schooling and a considerable number of well educated persons. For the Jews, who are concentrated in two large groups--9-12 and 13+ years of schooling--the effect of education level was barely discernible.
Other variables were demographic in nature. Marriage duration, supposedly one of the most important factors, may be approximated to some degree by the birth order of children born in the current marriage. The expected decline in the secondary sex ratio commensurate with birth order was not clearly discernible among the Jewish births, even when controlled for age group.
As in the case of education level, the sex ratio decline with birth order was more pronounced, but still minor, in the data for births of Moslem women. This result confirms that of James (1987a), who found that the decline of secondary sex ratio with birth order was very small in large human populations. The secondary sex ratio of first-born was found to be higher among Moslems (51.52) than among Jews (51.39). This finding is compatible with hypotheses about declining coital rates during couples' conjugal life and the effect of coital rates on secondary sex ratios. A considerable proportion of Jewish young couples cohabit for some time before marriage, while this be-

havior is still exceptional among Moslems. These different premarital arrangements may affect the sex of the first child.
In this study, as in many others, the secondary sex ratio exhibited a complicated correspondence to maternal age and a more-or-less apparent decline with paternal age. The sex ratio declines with paternal age for both Jews and Moslems. The study did not detect a descending trend in the sex ratio with maternal age among Jews. The curve in this variable resembles that found in England and Wales (James and Rostron, 1985). A steady and monodirectional decline in sex ratio with mother's age was discerned among the Moslems. The regression coefficients were positive for the Jews and negative for the Moslems. The results of the aforementioned study by James and Rostron show that the secondary sex ratio declined regularly with maternal age until 1959 and that afterwards, compared with the previous years, the sex ratio declined among women aged 20-24 and increased for mothers aged 30-34. The authors cited among possible causes the use of oral contraceptives, artificial insemination, racial heterogeneity, and rising promiscuity. Similar mechanisms may explain the difference in the secondary sex ratio patterns of Jews and Moslems in Israel.
It is also useful to examine the effect of the difference between maternal and paternal age (age of father less age of mother) on the sex ratio. Such an influence has been reported (Manning et al., 1997). In our data, the secondary sex ratio declines slightly as the age difference rises between husband and wife in the Jewish population and, to a lesser degree, in the Moslem population.

Finally, a multivariate analysis of available variables was performed to evaluate the cumulative importance of the explanatory variables. A multivariate logistic regression was built for sex of offspring as against maternal age, years of schooling, paternal age, and birth order. This method

allows us to estimate the fraction of the variance that each factor explains. Separate analyses were conducted for Jews and Moslems. Two models were built for each group: one including years of schooling in addition to maternal and paternal age and birth order; the other not including the

first-mentioned variable. The regression equations included only major effects.
The model that included years of schooling was not statistically significant, but the models excluding this variable were found significant for both religious groups, testing the hypothesis that the effects of the models arejointly equal to zero. As forthe univariate regression,the

coefficient for maternal agewas positive for Jewish mothers and negative for Moslems. Negative coefficients wereobtained for both religious groups with respect to paternal age and birth order in marriage. Thus, the effects appear to be the same inthe presence ofother factors.
Based on the results attained, we found several differences between Jewish

and Moslem patterns of secondary sex ratios. The difference may be described in sum as more regular behavior of the secondary sex ratio among Moslems than among Jews, that is, Moslems' behavior conforms more strongly than Jews' behavior to that predicted by the existing models.
We looked for other possible factors that may contribute to the observed difference in the patterns of Jewish and Moslem secondary sex ratios. One such factor might be the presence of a religiously observant (Orthodox) group within the Jewish population of Israel. A considerable part of Jewish births of high parity may be attributed to this population subgroup, thereby explaining the higher sex ratio for higher birth numbers among Jews than among Moslems. This factor, which we labeled as religious, deserves special reference due to the special effect of Jewish religious laws on the sexual behavior of Orthodox married couples.
THE RELIGIOUS FACTOR
Jewish religious laws require abstention from intercourse during menstruation and for a period of seven days after its end. This means that, given the usual 28-30 day cycle, intercourse may not resume before the thirteenth to the fifteenth day in the cycle, or 2-4 days before ovulation. The James theory predicts that the sex of offspring is affected by the day in the fertile cycle on which the insemination responsible for conception occurs.
Harlap (1979, cited by Guttentag and Secord (1983), analyzed data on 3,658 births among Jewish women who described themselves as adhering to Jewish law. The sex ratio among these births declined from 114 among those reportedly

caused by insemination 1-2 days before ovulation to a low of 97 for births resulting from insemination occurring on ovulation day. The sex ratio then rose again to 100 on the day following ovulation and to 153 the next day. Overall, the sex ratio was 112. The shortcomings of Harlap's research were criticized in a more recent study by Martin (1995). Martin surmises that the reported abstinence through seven "clean" days after menstruation had not been observed. This hypothesis may surely be true for some of the interviewed women. Therefore, information regarding religious communities as evidence of the influence of religious rules on the birth-sex ratio must be treated with some skepticism.
However, since the Jewish religious rules cause and even prescribe high rates of coitus during the two or so days before ovulation, when the probability of conceiving male offspring is higher, they should increase the secondary sex ratio. Strictly speaking, the Jewish religious codes of sexual conduct may influence the primary sex ratio, that at the time of conception. The results of genetic analysis of sex in spontaneous abortions indicate that the primary sex ratio and the secondary sex ratio may be quite comparable (Brewis, 1993). Hence, the observance of Jewish religious laws may increase the probability of birth of male offspring, but the expected change would be minor. This supposition is compatible with James's conclusion concerning a possible but very marginal effect of coital rates on the secondary sex ratio (James, 1994). The problem may be more complicated if the correspondence between coital frequency and secondary sex ratio is nonlinear, i.e., increasing in one domain of coital frequencies and decreasing in another.

Demographers (e.g., Dobroszycki, 1981) have traditionally denied the possibility of biased sex ratios at birth among Orthodox Jews on the basis of unsatisfactory quality of data stemming from underregistration of births of Jewish girls. They cite statistical data from nineteenthcentury Russia, where the secondary sex ratio was reported as high as 137, and other historical data sources of similar quality, and conclude that such a bias seems impossible. However, in the first Russian Empire census in 1897, we found a sex ratio of about 105 for Jewish children under the age of one, and a ratio of about 101 for the population at large at the same age. While this finding may result from different infant-mortality rates, it may also reflect the initial levels of the different groups' secondary sex ratio. The relatively high sex ratio among Orthodox Jews today is still considered an admissible and given fact by the leading researchers in the field (e.g., James, 1987a). The possibility that Orthodox Jews have an unusually high secondary sex ratio has been discussed by Guttentag and Secord (1983), but without a definite conclusion reached. We attempted to examine this possibility by applying data available in Israel.
We searched for evidence to examine our hypothesis within the data at our disposal. Israeli statistics contain no data on religiosity at the level of individual records. Therefore, we examined secondary sex ratios in localities characterized by a predominantly Orthodox population. We selected three such groups: (1) The secondary sex ratio during 19801995 was 52.11 in religious kibbutzim versus 51.63 in other (secular) kibbutzim. (2) Nine localities with a high proportion of voters for the ultra-Orthodox parties in

the 1996 elections showed an overall secondary sex ratio of 51.56. (3) Settlements defined as religious in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza had a sex ratio of 51.30. For the same period, three small strictly Orthodox localities--Emanuel, Upper Betar, and Kfar Chabad, showed rates of 51.80, 52.31, and 50.14, respectively. Since variances of such magnitudes occur in many Israeli localities, this finding in itself cannot lead us to any definite conclusion about the existence of a difference in the sex ratios at birth of Orthodox and nonOrthodox Jewish communities. Due to the small size of the groups under consideration, we could not control for socioeconomic status, the age-sex structure of the population groups, and other intervening factors that may affect the secondary sex ratios in the opposite direction of the religious rules. We did, however, examine the sex ratio patterns by maternal and paternal age and by birth number. The results are shown in Tables 6-8.
Comparing the foregoing results with those for the Jewish population at large and with the Moslems, we find a much higher sex ratio in high birth numbers and among older parents in the Orthodox group. For high birth numbers, there was a slight increase in the sex ratio among Moslems as well. Figure 2 presents secondary sex ratio data by birth number for the Jewish and Moslem populations and for the three Orthodox subpopulations.
This finding may be attributed to the influence of the Jewish religious laws. As stated, these rules may increase coital rates during the most fertile days of the cycle and thereby raise the probability of the birth of a male child to couples in older age groups. The sex ratio at birth does not increase at younger ages, possibly because religious observance is weaker among the

fruitful and to multiply (Genesis 9:7) implies the duty to have a daughter as well as a son. This tension may balance the secondary sex ratio in low parities, but when the sexes of a married couple's offspring attain the desired composition, the tension weakens and other factors, such as coital frequency, become more impor-

tant, thus boosting the sex ratio in high birth numbers.
It is possible that psychological factors influence more than the hormonal level. Supposing even that the secondary sex ratio is a completely random process, i.e., one that cannot be influenced directly by any of the aforementioned sociodemographic and

cultural factors, the ratios still can be to some degree altered merely by parental intentions. Data from various man-machine experiments indicate that human operators can bias random output distributions in accordance to their pre-stated intentions (Jahn, 1989). There is no reason to believe that parental intentions cannot influence processes at work within their own organisms. This proposition regarding the impact of parental intentions conforms well to results showing that more dominant mothers have more sons among their progeny, since it seems very plausible that the preferred sex of offspring in modern society still remains the male. Parental intentions, of course, are products of the sociocultural environment and, in turn, influence this environment. The role of parental intentions deserves more thorough examination but requires data sources not currently available.

ation would result in a lower total secondary sex ratio among Moslems than among Jews. The different patterns may also reflect the difference between population groups, such as the Jewish and the Moslem communities, that make greater and lesser use of contraceptives and induced abortions. Another possible factor is the religious one. Although the strict observance of religious rules cannot result in a noteworthy increase in the secondary sex ratio, it may contribute to a difference between Jewish and Moslem parental agepatterns related to the secondary sex ratio.
Most of the unexplained variance in secondary sex ratios may be the result of factors that can not be sufficiently approximated by the sociodemographic and cultural variables that we consider here. The secondary sex ratio differences may be traceable to much more indirect factors than the existing statistics can reveal.

CONCLUSIONS
Different secondary sex ratio patterns among Jews and Moslems in Israel may be responsible for the slightly higher sex ratio at birth observed among the Jewish population. The explanation may be that the higher fertility of Moslem women, with a large number of high-order births among older women, leads to a lower probability, relative to that of Jewish women, of giving birth to a boy.
