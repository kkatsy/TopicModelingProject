ABSTRACT: Fertility change over time in a migrating Mennonite church congregation is reconstructed through genealogies developed from church registries of vital events during 1725-1924. The congregation was located in Prussia from 1725-1821, in Russia from 1822-1874, and in Kansas, U.S.A., from 1875-1924. Age-specific marital fertility rates were relatively low and usually peaked for women aged 25-29. Total fertility rates ranged from 1.19 to 5.29. These relatively low figures for a natural fertility population may partly reflect underreporting of births and deaths of infants, but it also reflects the heterogeneity in fertility evident for this population. Some women had many children while others were having either few or none. This pattern changed twice. Fertility was lowest during residence late in Prussia and early in Russia, peaked during residence late in Russia, and has decreased slightly for women born in the United States.

Demographers describe population fertility as either controlled or natural depending on whether or not parents modify their behavior in response to the number of children already born (Henry, 1961). Natural fertility also includes deliberate spacing of births as long as the spacing behaviors are independent of family size (Knodel, 1983). Controlled fertility (family limitation) includes behaviors intended to result in a specific family size and are a historically late development documented first in eighteenth-century Western Europe (Coale, 1986; van de Walle, 1986). The fertility decline associated with these behaviors was achieved largely by reducing the number of births in the later years of a woman's reproductive span (stopping) rather than by delaying marriage (late start) or through an increase in the interbirth interval (spacing). The goal here will be to examine the starting, stopping,

and spacing behaviors associated with changing levels of fertility in a migrating Mennonite church congregation during the period 1775 to 1899.
Separation of church and state and adult baptism characterize the Anabaptist movement which originated during the Reformation in sixteenthcentury Switzerland and spread to Germany, the Netherlands, and other parts of Europe (Dyck, 1981; Smith, 1981). Dutch Anabaptists united under the leadership of Menno Simons and were known as Mennonites. Severe persecution forced them to migrate to other parts of Europe, including the Polish-controlled Danzig area. In 1699 eighteen families formed the Przechowka Church located on the west side of the Vistula River sixty miles south of Danzig (Gdansk) (Duerksen, 1955; Rogers, 1984). The congregation included primarily refugees from the Netherlands. Other founders were

1800's, a period that precedes the church fissions following their move to the United States.
METHODS
Henry (1972) was the first to try to determine the characteristics of fertility in the absence of birth control and noted (1961; also reviewed in Knodel, 1983; Wilson, 1984; Wilson et al., 1988; Wood, 1990) the striking differences in age-specific patterns between populations practicing natural versus controlled fertility. When no birth control is used, fertility declines primarily as a function of age, decreasing somewhat more rapidly after age 35. The average fertility as measured by total fertility rates in natural fertility populations may vary substantially, but the pattern remains the same. When family limitation is practiced, fertility rates drop sooner and are dramatically lower in the later years of a woman's reproductive span. Age-specific marital fertility rates are calculated for 25-year intervals (1775-1799, 1800-1824 . . . 1900-1924). Another measure of the age pattern of fertility is the proportion of the total marital fertility ratio contributed by women after the age of 30 years (Knodel, 1979; Wilson, 1984).
Parity progression ratios are also calculated because they provide another perspective on the pattern described above (Shryock and Siegel, 1975). The proportion of women for a particularly parity who go on to have another child will remain high if natural fertility is practiced. These ratios drop dramatically at the higher parities when fertility is being controlled (e.g., Wilson, 1984). Sample sizes are small for the Prussian period. Thus, vital sta-

tistics for women born during a 100year period (1725-1824) in Prussia are used to calculate the first set of ratios. The remaining ratios are derived from women born during the successive three 25-year intervals. There are insufficient numbers of women with death data to extend the analysis to a fourth 25-year cohort (1900-1924) since this data was initially compiled in 1982-83.
Another way to limit births would be to marry later and reduce the childbearing time. The average ages of mothers at marriage and first and last births and the average age of fathers at marriage are also calculated at 25-year intervals.
Finally, an additional means of limiting fertility would be to increase the time between births, but detecting intentionally lengthened birth intervals in historical data is problematic (Knodel, 1987). Interbirth intervals are inversely correlated with the number of children ever born and increase with the age of the mother within a group of women with the same completed family size (CFS). Age of marriage is also inversely correlated with the length of interbirth intervals for a group of women with the same CFS. In a Mormon population, Anderton and Bean (1985) demonstrate that interbirth intervals are stable within a group of women having the same CFS and remain stable during fertility transition, although proportions of women with lower CFS's increase. Interbirth intervals controlled for completed family size and proportions of women at each parity are also calculated. Again, the Prussian period is represented by women born during a 100-year period (1725-1824). The

RESULTS
Age-specific marital fertility rates, total marital fertility rates (TMF), and total marital fertility after age 30 as a per cent of the total marital fertility (TMFR30 + ) are presented at 25-year intervals for the Mennonites of this study in Table 2. Comparative populations representing natural (English parishes, Bavarian villages, and Ohio Amish) and family-limited (U.S. women) fertility schedules are also included. The pattern of the rates are presented in Figure 1 with the classic

example of natural fertility, the Hutterites. The intervals covering 17751824, 1825-1874, and 1875-1924, represent stays in Prussia, Russia, and the United States, respectively. At least 50 women are represented in each 25-year category which Handwerker (1988) has demonstrated is the minimum needed in order to estimate accurate fertility rates. Note that the age-specific rates within a particular cohort peak when women are aged 25-29 years with one exception, e.g., 1850-1874. Total marital fertility rates vary but are at least 4 after the late Prussian period, i.e., 1775-1824. The TMFR30+ ratios range from 38 to 59 per cent. Parity progression ratios are presented in

Table 3. They remain high throughout the reproductive span for all cohorts and only drop slightly for the cohort of women born during 1875-1899.
Measures of reproductive span at 25-year intervals are presented in Figure 2. The reproductive spans of women born during 1775-1799 and after 1875 are shorter than for women born at other times. The mean age at marriage is relatively high for women born during 1775-1799. It also increases during their stays in Russia and the United States and then declines during 1900-1924. The mean ages of fathers at first marriage are 24.81, 23.61, 24.93, 24.54, 25.16, and 26.03 years for the intervals 1775-1799, 1800-1824, 1825-1849, 1850-1874, 1875-1899, and 1900-1924, respectively. The husband is on average about 2 years older than the woman except during 1775-1799 when husband and wife are virtually the same age. The biggest difference, 4.83 years, is found for marriages which take place between 1900-1924.
Interbirth intervals controlled for completed family size are presented in Figure 3. Relatively small sample sizes result in more irregular curves, but the sizes of interbirth intervals do not vary much from period to period except for the average time between marriage and first birth. This interval steadily decreases after the Prussian period av-

eraging for all married women 50.4, 44.8, 39.1, and 32.3 months for 17751824, 1825-1849, 1850-1874, and 1875-1899, respectively.
The proportions of women at each parity for each period and comparative population data are presented in Table 4. The proportion of married women with no children is 15 per cent for women born during the late Prussian (1725-1824) and early Russian (18251849) periods. The proportion increases to 17.3 and 22.3 per cent for women born during the late Russian (1850-1875) and early U.S. (18751899) periods, respectively. The proportion of women with small families (1-3 children) is 34 per cent for the Prussian period, then drops to 16 and 28 per cent for the two Russian-born cohorts, and increases to 35 per cent for the U.S.-born cohort. The proportion of women with 7 or more children also varies: 30.6 per cent for Prussianborn women, increasing to 52.5 and 37.3 per cent for Russian-born women, and then decreasing to 16.5 per cent for U.S.-born women.
DISCUSSION
The age-specific rates are relatively low overall and are particularly low during their later years in Prussia and early years in Russia (see Table 2 and

Figure 1). Most rates and the shapes of the curves fall between or below the schedules typical for either natural or family-limited fertility populations. The total fertility rates ranging from 1.19 to 2.72 fall within the low to middle range expected for controlledfertility populations; whereas, the total fertility rates ranging from 4.14 to 5.29 are within the low end of the total fertility rates expected for natural fertility populations (reviewed by Wood, 1990).
The typical peak in age-specific rates for women aged 25-29 years, except during 1850-1874, is consistent with the relatively late mean age at marriage (see Figure 2) and the relatively long mean interval between marriage and first birth (see Figure 3). All the birth intervals may be slightly inflated (and the age-specific birth rates lowered) by underreporting of births and deaths of children who do not survive their first year (Everson et al., n.d.; Willigan and Lynch, 1982).
The late Russian period, 18501874, was a time of relative plenty (Urry, 1989; Wedel, 1974) and the women giving birth at that time had the lowest mean ages at marriage and longest reproductive spans (see Figure 2). The age-specific rates are highest for the periods covering 1850-1899. Increases in fertility rates over the late 1700's and early 1800's might be explained partly by the dampening effect resulting from the conditions forcing the move to Russia, but low fertility is characteristic for a very long time, i.e., 1775-1849.
In addition, Knodel and Wilson (1981) have documented a similar latenineteenth-century increase in fertility in many populations within Germany.

They suggest that improvements in nutrition and overall health may account for the increase in fecundity. There is no nutritional information for this Mennonite congregation, but mortality data indicate that one-third to one-half of the married women born during the Prussian period did not survive through their reproductive years (to age 45) (Everson et al., n.d.). After the move to Russia the rate drops to 20 per cent or less.
A crude measure of the shape of the age-specific rates is the total marital fertility after age 30 as a per cent of the total marital fertility (TMFR30 +) (see Table 2). This measure averages 46 per cent which is close to the 50 per cent expected for natural fertility populations (Knodel, 1979). One might predict that the ratio would be greater than 50 per cent because of their late start. The ratios are still high compared to family-limited populations which usually average 25 per cent or less. Also consistent with natural fertility are the parity progression ratios (see Table 3). The ratios remain high through the higher parities for all cohorts with only slight decreases for the first cohort to be born in the United States (1875-1899).
The intermediate pattern of the rates also reflects the heterogeneous nature of the population being described (see Table 4). There are a relatively high proportion of married women with no children, and most of the remaining women are having large families. The proportion of married women having no children steadily increases over all the cohorts. These figures may be inflated by women who somehow remained connected with the church even though marrying a mem-

ber of another congregation. Their children might not have been recorded if they were members of another congregation. However, husband's identification number and marriage date were present for most of the women in this category and for all childless married women born during 1875-1899, the period with the highest proportion of childless married women. If both pieces of information were missing, we assumed that the woman married into another congregation.
Table 4 also includes three comparative population samples: (1) White U.S. women at two time periods (late 1800's during the demographic transition and early 1920's which included women who contributed to the "Baby Boom" and practiced family limitation); and two natural-fertility population samples; (2) married Hutterite women, 1946-1950; and (3) married Amish women, 1964. The proportion of Mennonite women having 7 or more children remains high for women born from 1725 to 1874. The closest resemblance in fertility measures is between Amish women and Mennonite women born between 1825-1849, although the two groups differ dramatically in the proportion childless.
The proportion of women having 7 or more children decreases for women born after 1875 and signals the beginning of the demographic transition for this congregation. The reproductive span also shortens for this group. The mean ages of marriage and first birth actually decline, but there is an even greater decline in the mean age at last birth. Birth intervals do not change much overall except that the average time from marriage to first birth continues to decline. The timing of this

transition is consistent with the decline determined from birth history data taken from contemporary Mennonite women, some of whom are descendants of families included in this study (Stevenson et al., 1989). The contemporary study (a convenience sample) probably overrepresents the larger and more conservative families.
CONCLUSIONS
The fertility patterns determined from examining the vital statistics for families of a migrating church congregation reveal a great deal of complexity. In particular, some women were having many children, and some were having few or no children. The relative numbers of these two groups of women shifted at least twice. Life was harsher in Prussia and early Russia, and there were more women with smaller families (although not as relatively many married women with no children). It cannot be determined if this was due to high maternal mortality and poorer record-keeping (undercounting of births and deaths of children who do not survive the first year) rather than to deliberate family planning. Some deliberate control might be suggested by the fact that the interval between marriage and first birth is highest during this period of time no matter what a woman's completed family size and declines for the cohorts of married women born later.
In the late Russian period (18501874) the Mennonites became very successful farmers. Presumably overall health improved (judging by the reduction in maternal mortality), and the fertility schedules for this period most closely resemble schedules for natural

fertility populations such asthe Amish in 1964 (Cross andMcKusick, 1970). After themove to theUnited States, fertility eventually begins to decrease. Women born in the United States (birthdays after 1875) aremore likely to have smaller families, andthere is an ever-increasing number of childless married women. Fertile women are cutting off childbearing in their late 30's which is how the fertility transition begins formost European populations (Coale 1986; van deWalle 1986).

may be afunction ofthe reduced number of eligible mates, a topic for a future paper.
