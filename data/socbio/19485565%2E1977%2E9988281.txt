ABSTRACT: The U.S. fertility rate began a sharp and unexpected decline in 1971. Among the explanations for this decline are the liberalization of abortion laws and the initiation of major federal support for family planning services which began several years earlier. Using states as the unit for correlation analyses, we find no evidence consistent with the notion that subsidized family planning services contributed to the "birth dearth," but we identify trends that suggest legal abortions might have had an effect.

The U.S. fertility rate began an unexpected and precipitous decline in 1971 as illustrated in Figure 1. Our purpose is to examine two popular explanations for the decline: (1) legalization of abortions, and (2) increased federal subsidy for family planning services. Both happened several years in advance of the decline in births.
The first state abortion reform laws were enacted in 1967 (Weinstock et al., 1975). By 1969 there were nine states that permitted abortions for reasons other than preservation of the woman's life or health, and an estimated 22,670 legal abortions were performed. The numbers increased to 16 states and 193,491 legal abortions in 1970, and 485,816 legal abortions in 1971 (Center for Disease Control, 1974). That legalized abortion might have contributed to the "birth dearth," as this decline has been called, is suggested by the research of Sklar and Berkov (1974).
However, at about the same time that substantial numbers of legal abortions were first being performed in the United States, major federal support for family planning services began. In 1967, Con-

gress mandated special emphasis for family planning services as part of the antipoverty program. This mandate was followed by an amendment to the Child Health Act of 1967, which provided a substantial increase in federal funds for family planning services. The increase in numbers of patients served by organized family planning programs is reflected by this change in policy. The number of patients served by subsidized programs for the years prior to 1968 is unknown, but is commonly assumed to be negligible. The number of patients for 1968 has been estimated at 863,000, increasing to 1,070,000 in 1969 and 1,410,000 in 1970 (Corey, 1975). This increase in service might have contributed to the decline in births.
In the absence of appropriate analyses, we cannot conclude automatically that these changes in numbers of legal abortions and subsidized family planning patients contributed to the decline. If many legal abortions were primarily substitutes for what would have been illegal abortions, and if contraceptives obtained from federally subsidized services were substi-

tutes for those which would have been procured through private sources, we would not expect them to influence trends in fertility. Moreover, other factors might have actually caused the decline, such as increased utilization of private physicians for contraception or increased illegal abortions. Data are not available for examining these possibilities. Finally, both legalized abortions and subsidized family planning services are utilized by segments of the population rather than by all those at risk, and therefore their effects on the total population could be minimized.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
States and the District of Columbia constitute the units for analysis. Our strategy was to relate legal abortions to differ-

ences in fertility rates for each combination of the years 1967-71 with the hypothesis that states with the greatest number of abortions would exhibit the greatest declines in fertility. We correlated legal abortion ratios and fertility rate differences for the years before 1970. If the two rates were unrelated prior to 1970 but show a correlation after 1970, it is plausible that birth declines began after legalization of abortion, thus enhancing the plausibility of our thesis that the decline might be a consequence of the change in abortion laws. We repeated this analysis using subsidized family planning patient rates rather than legal abortion ratios to rank states, hypothesizing that states with the largest number of family planning patients would exhibit the greatest declines in fertility. Preliminary analyses showed

ratios in 1970 and differences between fertility rates for all combinations of years from 1967-71, for white women. The correlations for all differences involving 1971 fertility rates are of particular interest since the decline in births began in 1971. These correlations are all significant in the expected directions for the age groups under 40 but not for those over 40. In

general, correlations increase between the years prior to 1970 and the year 1970, as seen by reading down the columns of Table 1. This increase is consistent with the notion that abortion effects are being observed. Similar analyses are presented for nonwhite women in Table 2, and a similar conclusion is derived.
