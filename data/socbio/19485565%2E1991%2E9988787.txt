ABSTRACT: Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness affecting nearly 1 per cent of the general population. Family, twin, and adoption studies suggest that genetics plays a major role in the etiology of schizophrenia. The inheritance pattern appears complex, similar to that of other common conditions like heart disease. To uncover a causal genetic factor, researchers have recently begun to apply a linkage analysis strategy to schizophrenia. Early results suggest that there are many challenges facing scientists who undertake schizophrenia genetics research. While one study has shown significant linkage of schizophrenia to a region on chromosome 5, several other studies have not found linkage to this area. The likelihood that there are several major genes predisposing to the illness and uncertainties about inheritance patterns and diagnostic boundaries are potential difficulties to overcome. Many more families need to be studied, and creative complementary research strategies pursued, to achieve the potential success offered by a genetic linkage approach.

Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects approximately 1 per cent of the general population. Symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, social withdrawal, and diminished ambition. These changes in thinking and behavior usually begin in late teen or early adult years and may last a lifetime. The illness often causes its sufferers to lose the ability to work, study, or have close relationships. There are only partial treatments available; there is no cure. The underlying causes and brain mechanisms are unknown. The goal of current genetic research in schizophrenia is to identify a specific genetic cause or predisposition to the disorder that may lead to an understanding of the underlying mechanism of the illness, and eventually to improved treatments.
Family (Guze et al., 1983), twin (Kendler, 1983), and adoption (Lowing et al., 1983) studies provide strong

evidence for a major genetic component to the etiology of schizophrenia. However, the inheritance pattern is complex (Gottesman and Shields, 1982), unlike the simple Mendelian inheritance of Huntington's disease or cystic fibrosis. The genetics of schizophrenia appears to be more similar to that of other common illnesses, like diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or heart disease. These genetic factors likely make an individual vulnerable to developing the disorder. This genetic predisposition may involve several major genes, genetic interaction, important environmental components, or a combination of complicating factors.
LINKAGE ANALYSIS
To uncover an etiologic genetic factor, researchers have recently started applying a linkage analysis strategy to schizophrenia. The success of this

method in other illnesses, such as cystic fibrosis (Riodan et al., 1989) and familial Alzheimer's disease (St. GeorgeHyslop et al., 1987; Goate et al., 1991), has encouraged schizophrenia research groups around the world to pursue this approach. The assumption underlying use of this method is that a small number of major genes account for most of the genetic etiology of schizophrenia. That is, there are not numerous genes causing the disorder (polygenic model), but one or just a few major genes that account for most of the genetic etiology of the illness. There are many advantages to this sort of research strategy for schizophrenia because the method does not require prior knowledge about which gene is faulty or about the underlying mechanism of the disease.
Linkage analysis necessitates careful clinical assessments of family members, precise laboratory assignments of their DNA markers, and a final statistical linkage step to determine whether or not the markers selected are significantly linked to schizophrenia. In linkage studies a lod (log of the likelihood ratio) score greater than 3 is generally accepted as significant (Ott, 1985). This lod score is approximately equivalent to a p value of 0.05. A lod score less than - 2 indicates a significantly negative linkage result, suggesting the markers selected are not near a disease gene.
The goal of a linkage study is tofind a DNA variation, or "marker," that lies so close to an abnormal gene predisposing to schizophrenia that the two (marker and faulty gene) are "linked" or inherited together in a family. Tracing the marker in a family through sev-

eral generations requires the marker to have various forms (alleles) that are inherited in a simple Mendelian pattern so that one can determine from which parent and grandparent an individual has inherited the marker. Given that there are approximately six billion base pairs packaged in 23 pairs of chromosomes, and given that the mutation causing an illness may be as small as a change in a single base pair, the search has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack. However, there are both technological advances and clinical strategies that may help to localize a major gene for schizophrenia.
The ability to identify linked markers has been greatly facilitated by the development of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), genetic markers based on the substantial variation in DNA sequence between individuals, and the ability of sequence specific enzymes (restriction endonucleases) to identify such variation (Botstein et al., 1980). These RFLP's allow examination of virtually any part of the human genome for linkage to a disorder. The greater the number of alleles a marker has (that is, the more "polymorphic" the marker is), the more easily traceable it is through a family in a linkage study. Recently, dinucleotide (CA/GT) repeats, which are highly polymorphic markers, have developed into an important complementary technique to RFLP's for linkage studies of complex disorders (Litt and Luty, 1989).
While looking through all 23 chromosome pairs systematically is possible, it may be more efficient to examine candidate regions first (Bassett, 1989). This is where complementary

clinical strategies to linkage studies could play an important role. Finding chromosomal aberrations associated with schizophrenic disorders may suggest regions in which to focus a search for genes predisposing to schizophrenia using a linkage strategy. As for other illnesses, such as neurofibromatosis, chromosomal abnormalities may also provide useful tools for subsequent physical mapping, fine localization, and isolation of important susceptibility genes. One example of a chromosomal abnormality providing a clue to the location of a possible schizophrenia gene is a partial trisomy of chromosome 5. A section of the proximal long arm of chromosome 5 (5qll.2 to 5ql3.3) was identified as trisomic in two related individuals with schizophrenia accompanied by subtle physical abnormalities (Bassett et al., 1988). This chromosomal area therefore became a candidate region for linkage studies of schizophrenia.
LINKAGE ANALYSIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA
Sherrington et al. (1988), using seven families and examining linkage of schizophrenia to markers from chromosome 5, subsequently reported a positive lod score of 3. Unfortunately newspaper headlines at the time declared, "gene for schizophrenia found." This was never true. At best, and following replication by others, a significant linkage finding means a gene has been possibly localized to a specific chromosomal site. With respect to the schizophrenia results, Kennedy et al. (1988), at the same time as Sherrington et al. (1988), published

a study of an extended Swedish family showing significantly negative linkage of schizophrenia to the same chromosome 5 markers used in the Sherrington et al. (1988) study. No study to date has replicated the chromosome 5 positive linkage finding (Aschauer et al., 1990; Detera-Wadleigh et al., 1989; Kaufmann et al., 1989; St. Clair et al., 1989; McGuffin et al., 1990; Crowe et al., 1991). However, overall, not many families have been examined (Table 1).
CHALLENGES
Why don't we have an answer yet? First, most of these studies have only been going on for the last few years. Second, relatively few families have been studied. Third, there are many challenges facing researchers who tackle schizophrenia linkage studies (Baron, 1990). The precise mode of inheritance is unknown and is likely complex. There may be single major gene forms of schizophrenia, but interactive (epistatic) mechanisms appear possible (Risch, 1990). Other unknowns include the frequency of the gene in the population, the precise penetrance values (the chance, if one is carrying a gene for susceptibility to schizophrenia, of expressing that gene as schizophrenia), the degree of nonrandom or assortative mating (between, for example, two individuals with schizophrenia), the degree of genetic heterogeneity (how many different genes cause schizophrenia), and etiologic heterogeneity (how many cases of schizophrenia are caused by nongenetic factors).
There are also practical challenges facing researchers doing schizophrenia

genetics. Finding many large families is difficult in an illness that is characterized by social withdrawal and difficulties in interpersonal relationships that frequently reduce fertility. Linkage studies are most efficient when several family members have the full disorder and when several generations are available for study. This can be problematic with an adult-onset illness like schizophrenia that has a 10 per cent suicide rate. One of the most challenging aspects of a schizophrenia linkage study is finding families where nearly every member is willing to participate in the research. This is a particular difficulty in an illness that is frequently characterized by suspiciousness and social isolation.
STRATEGIES
How can researchers overcome some of these challenges? With respect to the practical issues, the sociocultural setting of participating families may minimize many of the difficulties. A rural population may be more stable,

with larger families being the norm. In addition, a good relationship with treating clinicians often helps encourage participation in research projects. Changing demographics make beginning linkage studies a somewhat urgent matter, while large sibships are still available.
Regarding the genetic issues, the major sections of a linkage project, clinical, molecular, and statistical, each play a role in reducing the obstacles to studying schizophrenia. Recruiting suitable families for linkage studies is believed by many to be the most important step determining the success of this approach. Participants in a recent workshop (Weeks et al., 1990) agreed that large sibships with long-term clinical follow-up are essential ingredients. Fortunately, the same strategies used to overcome the practical challenges to a linkage study are likely worthwhile for the genetic issues. Studies of several medium-sized families may have an advantage over studies of a few very large, especially inbred, pedigrees because the former

are considered less sensitive to errors in classification for individuals (Kelsoe et al., 1989). The possibility exists that, if numerous families are required to attain a positive linkage result, pooling data from various centers may be necessary.
MOLECULAR GENETIC STRATEGIES
The molecular genetic strategy most groups are pursuing includes three approaches: candidate genes, candidate regions, and a systematic search of the genome. While it is impossible to have a true candidate gene for a disorder with unknown pathophysiology, several potential candidate genes of the central nervous system are becoming available (Kennedy et al., 1989). The recently expanding list of dopamine receptors, Dl on 5q33-q34 (Sunahara et al., 1990), D2 (DRD2) on Ilq22-q23 (Grandy et al., 1989), D3, D4 (Van Tol et al., 1991), and D5 (Sunahara et al., 1991), are examples. The DRD2 locus did not show linkage to schizophrenia in a Swedish kindred (Moises et al., in press). Novel candidate gene probes, based on antigenic differences between schizophrenia and normal brain tissue, may also be developed (Honer et al., 1989) to study subjects from schizophrenia pedigrees.
As described above for chromosome 5q, another DNA marker approach employs candidate regions, suggested by associations between a chromosomal abnormality and schizophrenia. Such associations together with an independent positive linkage finding to the same chromosomal region may be crucial to isolate a gene successfully. Two pieces of evidence,

one physical and one statistical, linking a particular chromosomal area to the illness would substantially strengthen the probability of a true finding. In addition, an associated chromosomal abnormality may also provide a means for developing new, more closely linked markers and also physically delineating the genetic area involved. A recent review (Bassett, submitted) identifies potential candidate regions for linkage analysis of schizophrenia on chromosomes 5q, llq, 18q and 19p, and suggests that more chromosomal investigations into schizophrenia and other major psychotic disorders are needed.
A systematic search of the human genome is the molecular genetic strategy researchers will likely face, even while pursuing approaches using candidates. As noted above, a high resolution linkage map of polymorphic markers, including CA/GT repeats, will make such a search feasible for a complex disorder like schizophrenia.
Statistical methods to overcome the genetic challenges schizophrenia poses will need to take into account the complexities of the disorder, and linkage programs will need to be modified accordingly. The diagnostic hierarchy and genetic parameters, such as penetrance, to be used for analyses will have to be set a priori (Baron, 1990; Weeks et al., 1990).
Even if researchers meet all of these challenges, a significantly positive linkage finding that has been replicated in other samples is only the beginning of the journey toward isolating a gene. All of these strategies will probably be necessary to employ in further linkage analyses to localize more precisely a major gene, once initial linkage is

found to a region of the genome. Other molecular biological techniques may then be used to isolate and characterize the gene, as recently demonstrated by Riodan et al. (1989) for cystic fibrosis (CF). Although the CF work provides a model, isolation of a gene that acts in the brain to predispose to schizophrenia is expected to be much more difficult. Complementary schizophrenia research in other areas may be critical (Honer et al., 1990). A rare case with an informative chromosomal abnormality may also be important, as for neurofibromatosis (NF-1) (Wallace et al., 1990).
PROMISE
The recent positive linkage findings for breast cancer and familial Alzheimer's disease (Goate et al., 1991) show that statistical and other challenges may be overcome for common complex diseases. For schizophrenia, we have a realistic hope that linkage analysis will prove a fruitful strategy to aid in first identifying genetic and then other etiological factors important in the disorder. This is a long-term project requiring major investments of time, money, and effort. The slowness of the process may be an advantage, however, in working out some of the

intricate ethical issues raised by this research (Bassett, 1989).
In summary, the specific goal of a linkage analysis study is to identify a gene or genes that contribute to causing schizophrenia. This is likely to be an attainable goal given the availability of multiple informative pedigrees and current and evolving laboratory and statistical techniques. Once such a gene or genes are isolated, their site and mode of action may be determined. The ultimate goal is that this new knowledge will lead to a determination of the underlying mechanism of illness, with potential implications for even sporadic causes of the disorder. Also, understanding the specific nature of what is inherited in the disorder as part of a genetic diathesis may allow one to determine with more certainty what environmental and other nongenetic influences determine expression. It is hoped that this knowledge will lead to the subsequent development of more rational and effective therapeutic, and possibly preventive, strategies for this devastating illness.
