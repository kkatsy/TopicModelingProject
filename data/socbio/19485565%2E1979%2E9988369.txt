ABSTRACT: A main purpose of monitoring human germinal mutations is to detect environmental predisposing factors of public health concern. At least in principle, three general types may be investigated: specific locus mutations, structural chromosome rearrangements, and numerical chromosome abnormalities. Two different methodological approaches may be distinguished: (1) systematic and ad hoc studies of reproductive outcomes in a defined population of women; (2) opportunistic use of data already collected for other purposes. An unresolved ambiguity in the definition of specific locus and chromosomal germinal mutation rates in human populations is that such are defined as being rates of events "per gamete" but at present are only studied in the resulting organism which has survived to the time of recognition of the mutation.

·Data analyzed as of January 1,1978. See Hook, 1978a, 1978ft, for earlier analyses. tThe numerators include cases of known mutants only, that is, they exclude apparent denovo cases in which both parents have not been studied. The likelihood that such cases are new mutants is 75%. If such are included and all cases not known to be familial are analyzed, the ratios are 0.022, 0.040,0.029,0.026, and 0.030 up to 1972, and 0.075, 0.073, 0.057, 0.045, and 0.065 for 1973 through 1977.
$The ratio is lower here than in later years because in the earlier years many cases ascertained did not have family studies and thus could not be classified as known mutants. See footnote above for analyses which include such cases in examining trends in alt cases not known to be familial.
SThese calculations take into account variations in estimated completeness of reporting and total live births in the jurisdiction among other variables. Therefore, trends in estimated mutation rates will not parallel exactly the trends in ratios, although as may be noted they are highly correlated.
·These results are similar to observations in other studies that indicate ratios much higher for Robertsonian translocation Patau's syndrome than for Down's syndrome, but this rinding is not pertinent to the question of temporal trends in the ratios. With regard to this, the change in 1972 for Patau's syndrome is not as abrupt as it was for Down's syndrome. Moreover, if all cases not known to be familiar are included, then in 1973 the value was 2/4 not 1/4 (the only year that changes). But even including such cases, the ratio for all cases born before 1973 is 3/25 = 0.120 compared with a ratio of 0.400 in 1973, and of 10/49 = 0.204 for all years 1973-1977. These trends, while not significant at the 0.05 level because of the small numbers involved, are at least consistent in a general way with those observed for Down's syndrome for 1973-1977 compared to 1968-1972.
