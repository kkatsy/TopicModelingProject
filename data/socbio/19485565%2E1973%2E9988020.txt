No racial or ethnic group distinguished by the United States census has a fertility level as high as Mexican-Americans,1 when standardized for rural-urban residence. The comparison of various groups in Table 1 indicates the distinctiveness of MexicanAmericans' reproductive behavior, particularly in urban areas. At all ages in both urban and nonurban areas, American Indian women, who often are thought to have the highest fertility rates of any group, have borne fewer children per ever-married woman than Mexican-Americans.2 Among women in urban areas at the end of their childbearing years (those aged 35 to 49), the average number of children for MexicanAmericans is over 50% larger than for Negroes and about 70% greater than for native whites. This strikingly high fertility of Mexican-Americans relative to the dominant pattern in the United States has
1 Following the practice of the United States census bureau, the Mexican-American population is represented by the Spanish-surname population living in the five Southwestern states.
2 The slightly higher average number of children for the total American Indian population compared to the total Mexican-American population results from the gross differences in proportion rural. Only 23% of American Indians, compared to 80% of Mexican-Americans, lived in urban areas in 1960, and both groups had higher fertility rates in rural than urban areas.

received almost no sociological or demographic analysis (brief discussions are given in Browning and McLemore, 1964, p. 23-28 and in Grebler, Moore and Guzman, 1970, p. 126-128).
Although previously neglected by fertility studies, the Mexican-American population provides an exceptionally valuable case for observing how various factors influence family size. The foreign-born come from a developing country characterized by a very high rate of reproduction (crude birth rate above 40). They enter a modern, urban, industrial nation with moderately low levels of fertility (crude birth rate under 20). How they are their descendants adjust their fertility to this new environment reveals much about social determinants of reproduction. Similarly, variations within the population between subgroups with differing social and economic characteristics provide insight into the process of fertility reduction. An examination of the reproductive behavior of the foreign-born provides a starting place for this study of differential fertility patterns within the MexicanAmerican population.

of foreign-born persons living in the United States comes from the 1910 census (see Table 2). In that year Mexican-born women with completed fertility averaged 6.5 children each, which was substantially above the 4.3 average of native-born white women. Compared to other immigrants, however, Mexican women were not exceptional. On the other hand, by 1960 Mexicans occupied a unique position compared to all foreign-born women, by having more than twice the average number of children per ever-married woman. Despite a reduction from an average of 6.5 to 4.6 children for

Mexican women with completed childbearing, the second most fertile group in 1960 was Italian women, who averaged only 2.6 children each.
The size of completed families for Mexican-born women in 1960 was similar to that of native-born white women in the United States in 1910, which suggests that this group is lagging fifty years behind the dominant society in fertility behavior. Women who completed their childbearing by 1910, however, were bearing their children under conditions of much higher infant mortality than now exist. Therefore, with

tion of the population, fertility has actually been increasing (Arriaga, 1970). Moreover, recent investigators of Mexican fertility have concluded that urban fertility has increased and is no longer substantially lower than rural fertility (Robinson and Robinson, 1960; Zarate, 1967).
To be sure, Mexican immigrants have not been exactly replicating the reproductive levels of Mexicans in Mexico. The 1960 census of Mexico reported there were an

of other white women in the Southwest had that many.
Clearly, the fertility of Mexicans-- whether in developing and urbanizing Mexico, or in developed and urbanized North America--does not readily respond to influences that we customarily regard as antinatalist. But what of second and third generation Mexican-Americans? Have they made the transition from patterns characteristic of Mexico to those of the United States?
GENERATIONAL TRENDS IN FERTILITY
On the basis of most discussions of fertility determinants, one would expect native-born Mexican-Americans to substantially reduce the sizes of their families below the level of the immigrant genera-

complex, industrial economic system. The demographic literature repeatedly argues that each of these variables has a depressing effect upon fertility. However, there are other variables that might be operating to vitiate the force of these supposedly antinatalist factors. The continued concentration of second and third generation Mexican-Americans in ethnic enclaves (Grebler, Moore, and Guzman, 1970, p. 271-289) may encourage the preservation of earlier social patterns, their relatively disadvantaged socioeconomic position may weaken the impact of economic forces, and their greater^ emphasis on familism (Burma, 1954, p. 33-84; Murillo, 1971) may positively encourage large families.
Actual generational trends in MexicanAmerican fertility are presented in Table 3,

ican-Americans have produced more children per woman than the immigrant generation. Compared to fertility levels of populations with almost unchecked procreation, it is obvious that most MexicanAmericans do limit their family size. But it is equally apparent that as of 1960,even third generation Mexican-Americans had not adopted the small family size pattern characteristic of the dominant society. The lack of differentiation between generations in fertility performance does not, of course, imply that temporal changes are not occurring, nor that other important differences within the population do not exist. It simply indicates that length of exposure to American society has little relationship to the fertility behavior of Mexican-Americans.
Data from the 1970 census will permit a more adequate assessment of whether more recent cohorts of Mexican-Americans are beginning to significantly alter their fertility behavior, since the information in Table 3 is inconclusive. In 1960, the group of Mexican-American women aged 25 to 34 was well ahead of the comparable group of other white women in rate of childbearing, and it is probable that the differential in-

a much greater extent than other whites, Mexican-American women continue to bear children during the later stage of their fecund period of life. When a population begins to reduce its fertility, however, it is generally reflected first in a reduction of age-specific birth rates at the older ages. Therefore, it is possible that changes are occurring within the Mexican-American population, and that despite their initially rapid pace of reproduction, the younger cohorts may not replicate the pattern of the older ones.
SOCIOECONOMIC DIFFERENTIALS
IN FERTILITY
An examination of differential fertility by educational attainment within theMexican-American population produces the interesting results presented in Table 5. Mexican-American women who have completed four years of high school have almost exactly the same average number of children as do similarly educated other whites; but among the less educated, Mexican-American women have much higher fertility rates. Mexican-American women aged 35 to 54 who have completed high school have

an average of 2.7 children per mother, compared to 2.6 children for comparably educated other white women. In contrast, similar age Mexican-American mothers with less than eight years of schooling average over six children per woman, while poorly educated other white women average 3.8. The difference in number of childrenproduced by high school graduates and those with less than eight years of schooling is three times larger for Mexican-American women than for other white women. The

same pattern, though notquite as accentuated, is seen when education of husband is used instead of education of wife. Thus, it is thepoorly educated segment of the minority that is responsible for the exceptionally high fertility of this group. The fact that a very small per cent of all MexicanAmericans have completed four years of high school means that thelowfertility of the better educated has little influence upon the minority's overall rate.

occupation of the husband as an indicator of social class results in similar conclusions. Middle-class Mexican-Americans have families quite similar in size to other middleclass whites, while those with lower socioeconomic characteristics have much larger families than other whites in similar positions. The largest fertility differential by occupation for the total white population is one child per woman more among farm workers than among white collar workers, but for Mexican-Americans the difference between these two groups is 3.8 children per woman.
To better determine the relative social position of a woman, it is helpful to see how she rates on several variables simultaneously. Using this approach, it is possible to distinguish low fertility and high fertility syndromes among Mexican-American women. A woman is considered to have a low fertility syndrome if both she and her husband have a high school education and the husband earns at least $5,000 per year. The 67 Mexican-American women aged 35 to 54 with these characteristics who were included in the 1 in 1,000 sample from the 1960 census averaged only 2.0 children per woman, and only four (6%) had as many as five children. The high fertility syndrome applies to a woman if both she and her husband have attended less than eight years of school and the husband earns less than $3,000 per year. MexicanAmerican women in this category averaged 6.1 children per woman, and over twothirds had five or more children. Contrasting these two groups of women reveals clearly how extreme variations in family size are between different segments of the Mexican-American population.
DISCUSSION
Residence in the United States has reduced the fertility of Mexican-Americans to levels somewhat lower than those exist-

ing in Mexico, but the minority's continued large families by American standards and their lack of generational differences indicate that mere presence in a modern, urban milieu has only a limited impact upon reproductive behavior. Rather, it appears that family size is significantly reduced only among that segment of MexicanAmericans that has achieved middle-class status, a status which tends to reflect greater actual involvement in the dominant social structure. These fertility patterns within the Mexican-American population lend themselves to two opposing interpretations, and the conflict cannot be fully resolved without obtaining additional information.
One interpretation of the observed fertility patterns would follow the position found in family-planning literature, which emphasizes the importance of the instrumental factors in determining fertility behavior (for example, see Jaffe and Guttmacher, 1968). This position argues that the huge social class variations seen above indicate that lack of accessibility to contraceptives is primarily responsible for the group's high fertility. It suggests that the poorly educated and economically disadvantaged do not have access to effective contraceptives through private medicine and that public family-planning facilities are not readily available. Furthermore, lack of knowledge about the reproductive process and Catholic doctrine are seen as additional barriers to successful family planning by disadvantaged Mexican-Americans.
Until information becomes available on family size desires among Mexican-Americans, and on the extent to which they either lack knowledge of or access to contraceptives, an adequate assessment of this position is not possible. I t would be necessary to show not only that poorly educated Mexican-Americans are less able than the better educated to plan their families, but

Vol. 20, No. 1

also that they are, for some reason, less able than comparably educated other whites. Available information on attitudes toward contraception indicates that opposition to their use is not very substantial. A survey of Mexican-Americans in Los Angeles3 found that 62% of the respondents felt it was always or usually right for married couples to practice birth control, while only 15% felt it was always wrong.
The opposing interpretation of MexicanAmerican fertility would follow from the literature which challenges some basic assumptions of the family-planning movement, and which examines how reproductive motivation is structured in society (see Blake, 1965). This approach would emphasize that among Mexican-Americans who are largely assimilated into the dominant society (primarily the middle-class), the same forces are operating as for other whites, and their fertility is very similar. Among the less assimilated, however, one can find evidence of strong social support from the minority for large families, and this segment has very high fertility. Most important in encouraging and rewarding reproduction are the socially preferred family system and sex roles. As with the other position, more data are required to test this explanation, but some information on the Mexican-American family is suggestive of how strong reproductive motivation may arise.4
A variety of community studies have
3 For a description of the survey of MexicanAmericans in Los Angeles (949 interviews) and San Antonio (603 interviews), see Grebler, Moore, and Guzman, 1970, p. 631-665.
4 Studies 'of the family in Mexico also provide valuable evidence of how Mexican social structure encourages large families. Kahl (1967) shows that Mexican males have much larger family size ideals than comparable Brazilian males, and he relates this to distinctive aspects of Mexican family structure. A discussion of marriage and family roles by McGinn (1966) shows rather clearly how motivation for reproduction is encouraged by the role of females, which makes childbearing the only means of gaining status.

reported that the family (including the extended family) is the most important element in lower-class Mexican-American society. Sex roles are also clearly specified, with no socially approved alternative for females other than wife and mother with almost exclusive interest focused upon the family (see Burma, 1954; Murillo, 1971). One might expect this familistic emphasis to change with urbanization, and no doubt it is weakened. Nevertheless, when Mexican-Americans in Los Angeles and San Antonio were asked whether they agreed or disagreed that "Mexican-Americans tend to have stronger family ties than most other Americans," two-thirds expressed agreement. Based upon additional information from these surveys, Joan Moore (1970, p. 117) gives this summary of findings regarding the roles of females in metropolitan areas:
Women still find their major role and validation in their families, as wives and especially as mothers. Higher education and careers are still alien to many MexicanAmerican woman. Even a working wife is considered an embarrassment by most Mexican-American men.
Indeed, the very low educational achievement of Mexican-American females severely limits their options for alternative roles. In 1960, only 19% of all Mexican-American adult females were high school graduates, and only slightly more than 1% were college graduates. Among married MexicanAmerican females, only 23% were employed outside the home, compared to 36% of other white females.5 Moreover, while two-thirds of the employed otherwhite women had white-collar jobs, which permit greater social interaction and are presumably more rewarding than manual
5 As anticipated, Mexican-American females who are employed have fewer children than those who are not employed. Among women with their spouse present who were aged 35 to 54, those who were employed averaged 1.9 fewer children per women than those not employed.

jobs, only one-third of the employed Mexican-Americans had such jobs. Finally, there is little social involvement outside the family context. Seventy per cent of the respondents in Los Angeles and over 80% in San Antonio indicated that they do not belong to any organization that meets more or less regularly. Not only do they not attend social meetings, but they also do not have frequent interaction with neighbors. Five per cent in San Antonio and 18% in Los Angeles visit frequently with neighbors, while 80% in San Antonio stated that they visited rarely or never. An example of how completely Mexican-American women seem to have accepted the primacy of their role as mothers and rejected alternative roles is revealed by their responses to a question asking if they agreed or disagreed that, "Having children is the most important thing that can be done by a married woman." Over 85% of the respondents agreed with this statement concerning the preferred role for women.
Most likely, additional research will show that Mexican-American fertility patterns are best understood by combining the two interpretations discussed here. For the entire United States population, Bumpass and Westoff (1970) have shown that pregnancies among less educated and high parity women are more often unwanted than pregnancies among better educated and low parity woman. It would therefore be surprising if much of the higher fertility of Mexican-Americans is not a result of failures in family planning. At the same time, the much higher fertility of Mexican-American women than other whites in lower socioeconomic groups requires that special attention be focused upon the minority's unique social structure. The above discussion of family structure and sex roles as factors in the group's high rate of reproduction is only suggestive, but it is prom-

ising enough to encourage further research along these lines.
SUMMARY
Mexican-Americans present an interesting example of a group that even after three generations in the United States have reproductive levels more characteristic of nonindustrial than industrial populations. Further examination, however, reveals extreme variations within the Mexican-American population, with the middle class having the same size families as other whites. These findings suggest that it is not presence in, but rather involvement in an urban, industrial society which has greatest effect in forcing modification in reproductive behavior. A serious gap in our knowledge of Mexican-American fertility results from the absence of any information on desired family size. Without these data we cannot satisfactorily answer the question of how much of the high fertility of the lower-class results from their inability to prevent unwanted pregnancies, and how much it results from their desire for large families.
Future trends in Mexican-American fertility are likely to be most dependent upon how rapidly the group achieves upward social mobility and greater involvement in American society, although efforts of family-planning organizations may also have some effect. Thus far, the minority has been composed predominately of poorly educated and economically disadvantaged individuals, and these individuals have produced very large families. Increasingly, however, Mexican-Americans are.expressing discontent with their economic plight, and their efforts to change existing conditions may indirectly influence reproductive behavior. As more individuals perceive children as an expense and an impediment to greater economic achievement, and as

efforts at contraceptive dissemination among the poor increase, we can expect more Mexican-Americans to respond by reducing the sizes of their families.
