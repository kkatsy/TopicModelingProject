ABSTRACT:This paper compares the marriage frequencies of normal individuals with or without mental retardates in their nuclear families for the different combinations of sex and parental and sib phenotypes. Multivariate analysis indicates that there is a difference in the marriage frequencies of normal individuals with and without retarded family members caused by social response to the trait. This response differs according to the sex of the normal individual, although the social factors underlying this sex difference are not clear.

between social selection and kin selection

The evolutionary consequences of fitness interaction among relatives have also been considered in the study of altruism, where the concept of kin selection has an important role (Hamilton, 1964; Levitt, 1975; Matessi and Jayakar, 1976; Charlesworth, 1978; Wade, 1978; Yokoyama and Felsenstein, 1978; CavalliSforza and Feldman, 1978). However, the kin selection model requires at least two

The concept of social selection should clearly be distinguished from the effect of socioeconomic status on the reproductive fitness of an individual (Bajema, 1966, 1968). Social selection may operate within each social class and, furthermore, an affected individual may cause the downward mobility of the social class of his/her family (Moran, 1965).

different life stages, e.g., viability, marriage, divorce, fertility, etc. Accordingly, disease incidence depends on sociological as well as genetic contributions to fitness, and it is expected that the response to a disease will depend both upon the characteristics of the disease and upon the ambient culture. Although there exists some indication of such social reaction as already noted, no one has studied the mechanism or magnitude of social impact caused by an affected individual.
To detect such social selection, we shall compare the marriage frequencies of normal individuals with or without mental retardates in their nuclear families using the data in Reed and Reed (1965). They have compiled one of the most extensive data bases and, most importantly, have reported pedigrees over several generations. The marriage frequency of normal individuals was chosen because the genetic contribution to the choice of a mate is very small or almost nil and simply reflects people's reaction to mental retardation. To study people's response to the disease, further distinction among the retardates seems to be necessary since people may react differently to different levels of severity.
We used only the data from the original study, i.e., the data collected during the years 1911 to 1918, since marriage status is often unclear at the bottom of the pedigrees. Furthermore, by restricting our attention to the original data, trends due to changing social factors will be minimized. Mentally retarded individuals are classifed as L (Slight), M (Moderate), and S (Severe), corresponding to IQ scores of 50-69, 20-49, and less than 20, respectively, and individuals with normal IQ are classified as class N. Not all individuals are given IQ scores in the pedigrees, and we assume that the class "unknown mental ability" is normal (Reed and Reed consider this the most likely), and that "men-

tally deficient" individuals without IQ scores are of class L. An individual who is "unknown as to whether or not there are children" is excluded from analysis, and the resulting individuals are organized into nuclear families. We distinguish normal individuals with no sibs or with normal sibs, with at least one L sib, with at least one M sib, with at least one L sib and one M sib, and with at least one S sib. These classes are denoted by NN, LL, MM, LM, and SS, respectively. Thus, normal individuals are classified into different groups depending upon sex and upon parental and sibs' phenotypes.
Three nuclear families contained one parent belonging to the class M. But these are a very small portion of data and are therefore excluded from the analysis. The number of nuclear families of the parental types N x N, N x L, and L x L are 7,397, 758, and 132, respectively. The marriage frequencies for the different combinations of sex and parental and sib phenotypes are shown in Table 1. The mating behavior of the two sexes can be seen to differ. For females, the marriage frequency is weakly affected by sib's phenotype, but decreases by about 10 per cent when both parents are retarded, with the largest reductions (33 out of 48) for parental type L x L with at least one L sib. This reduction appears to be due to parental phenotypes since there is no significant reduction in the marriages of normal females with more severely retarded sibs. For males, the magnitude of reduction in the marriage frequency becomes larger as the severity of retardation increases. For example, the marriage frequency without any retarded sib is about 80 per cent, as compared to 65 per cent when at least one S sib is present. As in the case of females, there is a direct effect due to parental phenotype. Normal males with at least one L sib have a reduced marriage frequency when the parents are of type N x L or L x L. This is

a pardal explanation for the 10per cent reduction in the marriage frequency when at least one parent is retarded. Thus, in males, the marriage frequency is affected by both parents and sibs.
An ANOVA-like analysis for categorical data was used to analyze the data in Table 1. The multivariate analysis for the categorical data was done using the procedure FUNCAT (SAS User's Statistical Analysis System Guide, 1979 Edition, SAS Institute, Raleigh, North Carolina), which implements the generalized least squares method of Grizzle et al. (1969) with a logistic response function. The response variable was the dichotomous marriage variable and the main effects were sex, parental type, and sibling type coded in Table 1. The best fitting model is displayed in Table 2. The chi-square values given for each effect measure the effect of

eliminating that single term from the model. All three main effects (sex, parental-type, and sibling-type) are significant as is the sex-by-sibling-type interaction. No trends were indicated for the importance of the other interaction terms.

tarded sib. They have compared the reproduction of 208 normal persons from sibships with a retardate (IQ less than 70) to that of 208 normal first cousins from a sibship without a retardate. They have shown that the reproductive fitness is the same for the two groups (2.4 children per person). Although the marriage frequency is only one component of the fitness,there seems to exist a discrepancy between the present results and those of Reed and Reed. The difference may be due to the definition of mental retardation. If mental retardation is defined as IQ less than 70, then from Table 1 it can be calculated that the marriage frequencies of a normal person without any sibs or with normal sibs and of a normal person with at least one retarded sib are 4,931/ 6,030 (81.8 per cent) and 1,765/2,257 (78.2 per cent) respectively. Although a homogeneity test is significant (x2,ij = 13.52, /?<0.001), the difference between these marriage frequencies is small. People's response to the disease depends upon its severity and it is important to distinguish the retardates according to their severity in order to assess the social impact of mental retardation.
One may try to explain the decrease in the marriage frequency of a normal male with at least one S sib by considering that a normal individual with severely retarded sibs is more likely to have a lower IQ than a normal individual with less severely retarded sibs. Because of this lower IQ (even though higher than 70), the normal individual with a severely retarded sib has a lower marriage frequency than those with less severely retarded sibs. However, this explanation does not seem likely. Severe mental retardation is more likely to be caused by a chromosomal aberration or by a single gene, whereas mild retardation seems to be caused by many loci (Morton et al., 1977). Accordingly, the correlation of IQ scores between normals

and their mildly retarded sibs would be expected to be higher than that between normals and severely retarded sibs.
Our analysis indicates that the difference in the marriage frequencies of normal individuals with and without retarded family members is caused by social response to the trait and that this response depends on the sex of the normal individual. This suggests that different selective forces for mental retardation are operating in the two sexes, although the social factors underlying this sex difference are not clear. In addition, this may explain the difference in the mean number of surviving children of a proband's normal sister (2.44) and a proband's brother (2.10) which Reed et al. (1973) observed.
In the study of evolutionary aspects of genetic or common diseases, the fitness of an individual has traditionally been quantified by using only his/her genotype or phenotype. But the present data analysis clearly shows that the social impact of diseases cannot be ignored and the family structure has to be taken into consideration.
To estimate the fitness of a normal or mentally retarded individual under social selection, it is necessary to obtain information about the mental status of his own as well as his spouse's family members and the number of offspring. Unfortunately, the pedigree data in Reed and Reed does not give such a complete picture. Therefore, new data sets which will overcome these shortcomings are needed for fitness estimation under social selection.
