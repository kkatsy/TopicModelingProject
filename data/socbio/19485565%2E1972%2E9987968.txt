New Information-alerting Service for High Priority Research Subjects

A new information-alerting service that provides subscribers with weekly bibliographies of the journal literature published on nearly 100 scientific and technical subjects with high research priorities has been announced by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI®). Most of the subjects covered are in the areas of environmental science, medicine, biology, and chemistry, with emphasis on the adverse effects of pollutants, food additives, pesticides, and drugs.
The new alerting service is called ASCATOPICSTM. It monitors the complete output of the 2,500 most important international scientific and technical journals. The weekly bibliographies sent to subscribers list every new article on a given subject that has a title containing words related

to the subject; or is written by people or organizations known for their work in the subject; or references the key books and papers already written on the subject. Articles are usually listed in the bibliographies within three weeks after their publication in a journal.
The cost of ASCATOPICS varies, but most subjects can be covered for $95 a year for 52 bibliographies. For researchers without convenient access to a library, tear sheets of any article listed in an ASCATOPICS bibliography are available through ISI's OATS® service.
For more information on ASCATOPICS, contact the Institute for Scientific Information, 325 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19106.
