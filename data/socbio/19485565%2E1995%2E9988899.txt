ABSTRACT: This analysis examines the relationship between maternal determinants and birth weight in a population-based birth cohort of 5,284 mothers with singleton births of 28 completed gestational weeks in Qingdao, China, in 1992. Multiple linear regression models suggest that the length of the menstrual cycle, age at menarche, maternal weight, maternal height, parity, and number of antenatal visits had independent effects on birth weight after controlling for gestational age and sex of infant. The estimated difference in mean birth weight for each year after menarche was 11.7 g (95 per cent CI 4.6-18.8), and for each day of the menstrual cycle was 4.0 g (95 per cent CI, 2.1-6.0), after controlling for gestational age, sex of infant, maternal height, maternal weight, parity and the number of antenatal visits. No substantial differences in determinants of birth weight were found between the sexes. Maternal age, education, and occupation failed to reveal any significant association with birth weight. In sum, those women who reached menarche younger and had a relatively short menstrual cycle had a heavier baby on average, and the determinants of birth weight did not differ between male and female in the cohort.

Birth weight of an infant is the single most important determinant of survival, growth, and development (WHO, 1984). Various anthropometric, demographic, socioeconomic, and perinatal correlates of birth weight in populations have been described in the developed countries (Rantakallio, 1969; Winikoff and Debrovner, 1981; Ventura, 1982; Forbes and Small, 1983; Klebanoff et al., 1984), but much less work has been done in the developing countries. China, one of the largest developing countries of the world, possesses its own special socioeconomic environment and cultural traditions which make Chinese women at childbearing age a highly homogeneous population in terms of age at first

birth, marital status, schooling, socioeconomic status, and so on (People's Republic of China, 1991). This study was conducted on a population-based one-year birth cohort from Qingdao, China in 1992 to describe the distribution of the cohort by birth weight and to explore the relationship between maternal factors and birth weight, with special reference to menstrual history.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Qingdao is one of the largest cities on the east coast of China, with a population of more than one million distributed among the five administrative districts in its urban area. The basic data on birth cohort were obtained in

1992 from birth records kept by the Qingdao Health Center for Women and Children with respect to all 18 hospitals distributed over these administrative districts. The information available from the birth records included maternal name and age, date of delivery, birth weight and length, gestational age, outcome of birth, mode of delivery and cause of death for stillbirths and neonatal deaths.
More detailed information on maternity was collected from the Perinatal Health Care Records kept by the maternity and children's health care doctors for all pregnant women from their first antenatal visit onward. The women had to bring the records with them each time they attended an antenatal clinic, and the records were retained by the hospitals where the women gave birth.
The maternity and children's health centers at the level of the administrative district were routinely responsible for collecting the records from all the hospitals located in their area. The health centers also regularly exchanged records in order to retrieve those records belonging to women who were inhabitants of their districts but who had given birth at a hospital located elsewhere. The information provided by the records covered maternal demographics, pregnancy-related factors, antenatal care, constitutional factors, and menstrual history. The data from the birth records were linked to the antenatal records by means of the maternal name, age, and date of delivery.
For this study, the data from only three of the five administrative districts, Cangkou, Cifang, and Taidong, were analyzed because a part of the

records was missing in the other two districts, Shinan and Shibei. There were a total of 5,634 eligible births in these three districts in 1992, of which 5,505 (98.0 per cent) were entered into our data set. Since the present analysis was restricted to singletons with 28 completed gestational weeks and at least 1,000 g in birth weight, 81 multiple births (1.5 per cent) and one premature birth less than 28 gestational weeks were excluded. In addition, 139 other cases (2.5 per cent) were excluded, including 72 in which the number of offspring was unknown, 21 in which the birth weight was unknown, and 46 extreme outliers regarding birth weight, gestational age, or the menstrual cycle. This selection procedure resulted in a cohort of 5,284 singleton births for the present study.
Age at menarche, the length of menstrual cycle, and other maternal information were recorded, along with measurements performed by doctors at the mothers' first antenatal visits. The length of menstrual cycle was recorded as an average length, which was obtained by asking the question "How many days was your menstrual cycle on average before the pregnancy? (The length of menstrual cycle is defined as the first day of the period until the last day of the whole cycle)." Outcomes of pregnancy and information on the neonates were recorded by midwives or obstetricians during labor in the hospitals. Birth weights were recorded to the nearest 50 g, and gestational age was calculated as the interval between the first day of the mother's last menstrual period and the date of delivery.
The mothers' education was originally recorded as college (including postgraduate), secondary school, ele-

mentary school, and illiterate, which in terms of the current Chinese educational system, indicates a duration of schooling of > =13, 7-12, < =6 years, respectively. The mothers' occupations, according to the Chinese classification, were recorded in terms of cadre strata--including various grades of managers in government organizations and state-owned businesses, doctors, lawyers, teachers, and most other occupations requiring a higher level of education and special professionals, and non-cadre strata--including servants, workers, the self-employed, a few farmers, the unemployed, and all others without cadre status.
The effect of marital status could not be estimated because almost all the mothers in the cohort were married at delivery. According to Chinese marriage law, divorce is not allowed during a woman's pregnancy or before the baby is one year old. Based on the data of the China National Survey 1990 (People's Republic of China, 1991), the rate of divorce was less than 0.8 per cent among women of child-bearing age in urban areas of China).
Description of the variables included in the study are presented in Table 1. One-way analysis of variance was used to test the null hypothesis that the mean birth weights among the different categories for each explanatory variable are equal. Those variables with/> values less than 0.05 in one-way analysis of variance were included in multiple regression analysis in the form of continuous variables. To determine whether a factor contributed to the variation in birth weight independent of both gestational age and sex of the infant, we performed a multiple linear regression analysis in which the factor

was entered after both gestational age and infant sex. Polynomial models were applied if a function of over firstorder regression was found between birth weight and the independent variables. Interactions were considered if the product terms among independent variables were statistically significant in their prediction of birth weight. To control for the impact of variation with timing of maternal weight measurement, the first antenatal visit was kept in the multiple models. The same analysis procedures mentioned above were taken for males and females separately to find out if there was any difference in maternal determinants of birth weight between the sexes. Those with p values less or equal to 0.05 were entered into the model. SPSS for Windows 6.1 was used to analyze the data.
RESULTS
The distributions of maternal factors in the birth cohort are given in Table 1. The structure in terms of maternal age was highly concentrated in the twenties, and there was only one mother less than 20 years. About 83 per cent had 12 years of schooling or less, over three-quarters were classified as non-cadres, and 93 per cent of the parturient was primiparae. Concerning antenatal care, most of the pregnant women began to visit the mother and child health care centers during the second trimester. The numbers of antenatal visits ranged from 0 to 18, with a mean of 7.5.
The results of the one-way analyses of variance are shown in Table 1 as well. The mean birth weights of the babies whose mothers had previously experienced one or more pregnancies

were greater than for those whose mothers had not, the trend being clearly a linear one (p< 0.001). Similarly, the mean birth weight was greater among multiparous than among primiparous mothers, with a difference of 129 g (p<0.001). The number of antenatal visits before delivery was positively associated to the mean birth weight, but no linear relation was observed with the time of the first antenatal visit, even though the differences in means among the groups were statistically significant. Both age at menarche and the length of menstrual cycle were significantly correlated with birth weight. Mean birth weights were greater if the mother had reached menarche before 14 years of age and were progressively greater the shorter the menstrual cycle was, the latter trend giving a significant result in a test of linearity. In addition, both the mother's height and weight during pregnancy were positively related to mean birth weights, whereas education and occupation were not statistically significant at the level of 0.05.
All the variables that were statistically significant (p < 0.05) in relation to birth weight in one-way analysis of variance were included in a multiple regression analysis after controlling for gestational age, with both linear and quadratic terms, and the sex of the infant. Variables which were significant in partial F tests were maternal height, maternal weight, menstrual cycle, parity, age at menarche, and the number of antenatal visits, indicating that these variables had made significant contributions to birth weight independent of the gestational age and the sex of the infant (see Table 2). When analyses were made for males and females sep-

arately, all the variables still made significant contributions to the linear regression models, and no substantial differences in estimated effects were found between the two models. No product terms among independent variables made significant contributions to prediction of birth weight.
The results of the effects of age at menarche and length of menstrual cycle on birth weight after adjusting for gestational age, sex of infant, maternal height, maternal weight, parity, and the number of antenatal visits are shown in Table 3. The estimated effects were about 12.0 g (95 per cent CI 4.6-18.8) per year for age at menarche and about 4.0 g (95 per cent CI 2.06.0) per day for menstrual cycle. The results had changed somewhat compared with the corresponding results shown in Table 2, but they still made independent contributions to prediction of birth weights.
DISCUSSION
China, being a large developing country which possesses a special socioeconomic and cultural environment of its own, has specific characteristics that differentiate it from other countries. These characteristics include less smoking among women of childbearing age (Fung et al., 1989; Yip Li, 1991), a low rate of divorce, a low incidence of teenage mothers, a high proportion of families with one child, and a concentration of child-bearing to mothers in their twenties (People's Republic of China, 1991). AH these characteristics have undoubtedly exerted a substantial impact on pregnancy outcomes in the population. The present

will probably take them one or two years, or even more, depending on the area. This situation may explain the finding that maternal age was not statistically correlated with birth weight. According to Kramer (1987), young teenagers or women over 35 years of age may exhibit impaired intrauterine growth or gestational duration, but the present population included only one mother aged less than 20 years and 138 mothers (2.6 per cent) over 35 years. Thus, no further interpretation could be provided on the effects of extremes in the maternal age spectrum on birth weight.
Neither maternal education nor occupation were related to birth weight in this analysis, although different results have been reported by others concerning the relationship between maternal education, occupation, and birth weight (Lechtig et al., 1975; Scott et al., 1981;Linn et al., 1982; DaVanzo et al., 1984). Kramer (1987) inferred in his review that socioeconomic status has no independent effect on intrauterine growth, and low socioeconomic status may be a social "cause" of other nutritional, toxic, anthropometric, or infection factors that may themselves be determinants of birth weight. However, education and occupation may not be good indicators of economic background and living standards among urban residents in China because of the small differences in incomes between cadres and non-cadres. Thus, in this population, those workers who would normally be ranked in the lower social classes by the standards of other countries, e.g., workers in the non-cadre strata, may well earn more money than those with higher education levels and good jobs. In addition,

there is universal access to health care and education for women in the urban areas of China, and women can receive all the basic health care and nutrition during pregnancy that is necessary for adequate fetal growth (Yan, 1989; Yip etal., 1991).
Good antenatal care is suggested to have a beneficial impact on intrauterine growth and gestational duration, either through the diagnosis and timely treatment of pregnancy complications or by eliminating or reducing modifiable risk factors. Concerning the number of antenatal visits, the greater the number of contacts with health professionals who attempt to reduce or eliminate risk factors and treat pregnancy complications, the better the outcome should theoretically be. Some surveys in developed countries have reported positive results in this respect (Lechtig et al., 1975; Showstack et al., 1984). In our analysis, the number of antenatal visits had independent effects on birth weight after adjusting for gestational age and sex. Thus, the mean birth weight would have been about 7.1 g (95 per cent CI 2.7-11.5) greater if each mother had made one more antenatal visit. The timing of the first antenatal visit was not statistically significant in multiple analysis as it was in the one-way analysis of variance. This result may be due to the possibility of negative confounding effects when describing the relationship between antenatal care and the outcome of pregnancy, i.e., the women who seek antenatal care at an early stage may be those who have experienced problems. We could not avoid such "confounding by indication" (Kramer, 1987) in this analysis, which may explain the fact that emerged in the

182

one-way analysis of variance, (Table 1) that those women who made their first antenatal visit during the first trimester of pregnancy had babies with lower mean birth weights than those who did so later in the pregnancy.
Age at menarche was found to have an independent effect on birth weight, that is, those women who reached menarche younger had a heavier baby on average than those who were older, after controlling for the other variables mentioned above. A similar result was reported by DaVanzo from Malaysia (DaVanzo et al., 1984). Age at menarche is thought to reflect the nutrition of pubescent girls (Tanner, 1962), in that nutrition affects their size (Tanner, 1962) and a small size tends to delay the onset of menarche (Frisch and McArthur, 1974). Menarche is also associated with socioeconomic status (Rantakallio, 1969; Simell, 1952). Thus, the relationship between birth weight and age at menarche may be understood at least partly in terms of a mechanism in which nutrition, height, and socioeconomic status influence birth weight in addition to the independent impact of the factor as such.
One interesting finding in this analysis concerns the relationship between the length of menstrual cycle and birth weight. As shown in Tables 1-3, those mothers with a shorter menstrual cycle on average had heavier babies than those with a longer cycle. The estimated effect for each day of the menstrual cycle was 5.5 g, after adjustment for gestational age and sex of infant. Furthermore, when maternal height, maternal weight, parity, and the number of antenatal visits were included in the model as well, the effect remained

significant (4.0 g, 95 per cent CI 2.16.0).
Thus far we know of no other published report dealing with the relationship of the menstrual cycle to birth weight. No statistically significant interactions with respect to birth weight were found here between the menstrual cycle and other independent variables. We can hardly say that any substantial bias would arise in rounding newborns' birth weights. Chance and method of rounding was equal for every newborn, and any bias because of rounding, should be a nondifferential misclassification, which tends toward the null value and probably would have weakened the existing association of interest (Rothman, 1986).
The length of the menstrual cycle could perhaps be an indicator of the development and of the functioning of the female's hormone endocrinological environment and mechanism. Those women who experience a short menstrual cycle may be reflecting better development of their sex organs and hormonal activity, which would benefit fetal development during pregnancy. Even though the estimated effect revealed by our analyses is small, the results could hardly be explained by chance, as the partial F tests had provided P values of less than 0.001. The results encourage further evaluation of an association between the length of mothers' menstrual cycles and the birth weight of newborns among different populations and an exploration of possible biological mechanisms.
Variables which are commonly recognized as being important for the prediction of birth weight but which could not be assessed in this analysis are nu-
