ABSTRACT: From data on consanguineous marriages in Spain for 1911 to 1943 for the whole country and for four macro regions, the behavior and relationship of consanguinity and demographic variables, such as density, birth rate, death rate, and marriage rate, are demonstrated and discussed. Differences among macro regions for all the variables analyzed and a constant inverse and significant relationship between consanguinity level and density have been found. A clear relationship between socioeconomic development of the regions and consanguinity has not been found. The influence of each demographic variable in space and time is studied by partial correlation and multiple regression analyses.

It is a difficult task to describe the main biological characteristics of the human population in Spain today using only the available genetic and demographic information without considering the geographical features and the historical background of the country. The genetic data are very complex, in some cases scarce (Dobson et al., 1967), and sometimes contradictory. For example, if we take the distribution of haptoglobin types (Planas et al., 1966; Pons et al., 1968), we could say that the Spaniards are very homogeneous. But if we consider the gene frequency of the ABO, MN, or Kell blood groups, some other red cell enzyme polymorphisms (ADA, AK, 6-PGD, PGM, AP), serum protein polymorphisms (C3, «i-at, Pche, Tf, Gc, Cp), or the frequency of thalassemia (Mourant, 1954; Goedde et al., 1972, 1973; Cabezas and MartinBarrientos, 1973; Campillo et al., 1973, Pellicer and Casado, 1970; Lisker et al., 1967), notable differences exist between different regions.

Sometimes this heterogeneity is explained by the authors as a result of isolation and inbreeding, as for example in the case of the Basque region in Goedde et al. (1973). The same authors indicate the importance of relating the biological findings to anthropological, sociological and historical studies because "even nowadays the population of Spain appears to be different from several points of view" (p. SS3). The same complexities and heterogeneity are found in the demographic data, namely, natality, mortality, marriage, and migration rates (Daric, 19S6; Instituto Nacional de Estadistica, 1959, 1966; Tapinos, 1966), and the consanguineous marriage data (Vails, 1962, 1966, 1967, 1969). All of them bring out the considerable heterogeneity of the country and of its inhabitants. There are regions or provinces with similar characteristics, but the differences are also remarkable, not only among different provinces or regions, but within some provinces.
In our opinion, therefore, a good ap-

The marriages were classified as follows: uncle-niece and aunt-nephew (coded in our work as Type 12); first cousins (Type 22); first cousins once removed (Type 23); second cousins (Type 33);second cousins once removed (Type 34); third cousins (Type 44); those with multiple consanguinity and others. Types 34 and 44 are recorded only for the years 1911 to 1918. For this reason, in the calculation of the coefficient of consanguinity for each province these two types and the last two are considered together and called "others," while in the analysis of variation in time they are not considered. The recording, processing, and transformation of these data have been described in a previous publication (Pinto-Cisternas and Moroni, 1967).
The demographic data for each year and for each of the fifty provinces of Spain (administrative division) were obtained directly from the Instituto Nacional de Estadi'stica de Espana, in Madrid, and consisted of the following information: surface in km2, total number of inhabitants, civil marriages, births, and deaths. Other demographic data were obtained, but not for all years: total number of infant deaths for the years 1932 and 1940, total number of illiterates for the years 1910 and 1920, and total number of inhabitants living in one province but born in another for the years 1920 and 1940.
Besides the inaccuracies already considered, this kind of information also contains inaccuracies of a different type, and some of them, i.e., the crude rates, must be considered as rough indicators of what they are intended to measure. In any case, we can say that this demographic information is, even with its defects, the most reliable and accurate data for this period. These errors also are not serious enough to invalidate the tendencies and relationships we have found (Henry, 1966; Jamison and

Akers, 1968; Rosenwaike, 1972; Ekanen, 1972; Khan, 1975; Livi-Bacci, 1968).
Since there is not an exact correspondence between dioceses and provinces, we corrected the data of the dioceses to those of the provinces so we could relate civil and ecclesiastic data. We assigned to each province that percentage of each diocese that belonged to it with respect to the area in square kilometers. Table 1 gives the relation between provinces and dioceses. There are 49 provinces because the two provinces that form the Canary Islands were considered as one. The number in brackets is the percentage of the diocese belonging to that province. This percentage served to apportion the consanguineous marriages to the various provinces. We are aware that this division is not uniform because the places where the marriages were performed are not uniformly distributed in the dioceses, and the percentages are in some cases very approximate. We think it is unlikely that this way of rearranging the data would cause any significant error in our final calculations and results.
After this was done, the data were punched on IBM cards. With these cards and utilizing the 360/44 computer of the University of Pavia, the following calculations were made for each province for the whole period and for each year: density (inhabitants/km2), birth rate (per 1,000 inhabitants), death rate (per 1,000 inhabitants), marriage rate (per 1,000 inhabitants), frequency of consanguineous marriages over total civil marriages (number of marriages of Types 12-22-23-33 and others per 1,000 civil marriages), frequency of different types of consanguineous marriages (per 1,000 consanguineous marriages) and the average coefficient of consanguinity (a). The same data were also calculated for each province and for the whole country, grouping them in seven

different subperiods. Because of the number of years considered (33), the subperiods 1 and 7 are of four years only, and the others of five years. Finally, utilizing the total data of each province, we calculated the same indices for the "macro" regions. All these data were transformed to a logarithmic scale for the different statisti-

cal analyses. Partial correlation coefficients among demographic and consanguinity variables were calculated with the total data for each province and for the seven subperiods.
The four "macro" geographical regions were formed by grouping some adjacent geographical classical regions with similar

characteristics. Figure 1 shows their composition and geographical location.
Thus, we have a North Atlantic macro region A (Asturias, Galica, Vascongadas), a Central Plateau region B (Castilla la Nueva, Castilla la Vieja, Extremadura, Leon), an Eastern Mediterranean region C (Aragon, Cataluna, Murcia, Valencia), and a Southern Mediterranean region D (Andalucia). This subdivision is very similar to the one made for the analysis of the internal migration in Spain (Duocastella, 1957), and for a demographic study made by Livi-Bacci (1968).
With the calculated indices of each region, we performed multiple regression on the variables mentioned above, considering, successively, the coefficient of consanguinity, the frequency of first cousin marriages, and the frequency of second cousin marriages as dependent variables.
We must remark here that for all dioceses the data for consanguineous marriages for the year 1924 are missing. For this reason, the calculations that involved these data for the subperiod 1920-24 were made only for four years. Furthermore, we must note that during the years of the Civil War (1936-39), in some dioceses, the dispensation data for consanguineous marriages were lost. This loss is particularly marked for the years 1937 and 1938 and in the regions of Cataluna Valencia, the south of Andalucia, and some parts of Castilla. All our calculations were corrected for the number of years for which data were available.
RESULTS
The distribution of the different types of consanguineous marriages for each diocese and for each year were the basic data for all analyses carried out. The size of this material impedes its publication here.1
1 These data can be obtained on request from G. Zei.

In order to examine the variations in space of the variables considered, Table 2 shows the values for the complete period and for each province. These data, which can be considered as the mean values for the 33 years, are suitable for a general analysis for all the provinces. A glance at the table shows: (a) There is a great heterogeneity for all variables, although some (e.g., the marriage rate) fluctuate around the common values found in other regions of Western Europe (Livi-Bacci, 1968; Prioux-Marchal, 1974; INED, 1977; Federici, 1965). It is possible that some provinces of Spain resemble southern Italy or Greece more than they do Belgium or Sweden (Hajnal, 1965); (b)There is a high mean value of the coefficient of consanguinity (a). Half the provinces have a coefficient of consanguinity greater than 0.002, and one-fifth have values greater than 0.003. Considering that this index shows a constant decline during the last IS years examined, these values for a period of 33 years are extremely high, (c) Among the different types of consanguineous marriages, the highest frequency corresponds to marriages of second cousins (Type 33) and the lowest to the marriages of uncle (aunt) and niece (nephew) (Type 12). Out of the 47 provinces which remain after removing the Balearic and Canary Islands which are analyzed in a separate paper (Pinto-Cisternas et al., 1976), consanguineous marriages of Type 33 are the most common in 39 provinces, (d) There is not a clear relationship between the marriage rate and the total frequency of consanguineous marriages. A high (or low) value of the former does not correspond to a high (or low) value of the latter. Conjecturally, the factors that influence marriages in general and consanguineous marriages in particular are different or act in different ways, (e) There is an inverse relationship between the density and the coefficient of consanguinity.

tion coefficients for the 47 provinces for the complete period, calculated separately between density and consanguineous marriages ofType 22 and between density and consanguineous marriages of Type 33, give the following results: r = -0.4148 and r = -0.6689, significant respectively at the 0.01 and 0.001 level.
All these facts are in concordance with other findings about consanguinitydemonstrated in other countries, namely, high values ofa inregions oflow density, farming regions, andthose with low socioeconomic development, and, low values of a in zones ofhigh density, urban conditions, and high socioeconomic development (Moroni, 1969;Freire-Maia and FreireMaia, 1961; Freire-Maia, 1968, 1969; Twiesselmann et al., 1962; Sutter and Tabah, 1948; Neeletal., 1949; Lazoetal., 1970; Vails, 1969).
Our data also show a higher frequency of marriages ofType 22 than ofType 33 in provinces with high urbanization levels; five provinces (Alava, Barcelona, Cadiz, Madrid, Vizcaya) out of the eight where this type of marriage is the most frequent have 30 per cent urban population. Nevertheless, wedo nothave more detailed information about theconsanguineous marriages (frequently by parish, geographical origin of the mates, etc.) to affirm this relationship. On the other hand, some data from other urban centers, Milan, Italy, and Valparaiso, Chile, (Moroni, 1974, unpublished data; Lazo, 1974, unpublished data) show that within a city it is possible to find true "isolates" formed by immigrants from different regions to the city.
This situation could becompared to the subdivision of a population into a large number of small communities, geographically separated from each other. Data of 1910 (Enciclopedia Espasa Calpe, 1923) show that five provinces (Alava, Almerfa, Guipuzcoa, Santander, Vizcaya) of the

"macro" region A had the smallest increment. The "macro" regions B and C have intermediate values, close to the main increment of the whole country, that is, 31.87 per cent.
As regards the birth and death rates, the trend for each variable is very similar for each region, but there is a different ranking with respect to each rate. However, on the whole, regions B and D have high birth rates and regions A and C low values. The same trend and association of regions are shown for the death rate. The high values of the death rate for the second and sixth subperiods are due to the influenza epidemic of 1918 and to the Civil War of 1936-39, respectively. In any case, both rates have a "normal" trend, i.e., a continuous decrease in time. Finally, the marriage rate has the most irregular trend, but region A presents the lowest values for the entire period. The values of the last two subperiods are influenced by the Civil War. Owing to its

irregular trend, the marriage rate is the least clear of the demographic variables in its relationship to the socioeconomic development of these zones.
Thus, with respect to the demographic variables, these regions present the following behavior: region A--high density, but low increment of the population, low natality, mortality, and nuptiality; region B--low density but intermediate increment of the population, high natality, mortality, and nuptiality; region C-- intermediate density and increment of population, low natality and mortality, and high nuptiality; and region D-- intermediate density, high increment of population, high natality, mortality, and nuptiality. On the basis of this information, and considering the relationship between the socioeconomic development of a geographical zone and its demographic characteristics, the four macro regions could be tentatively grouped into "highly" and "less" developed zones, at-

35 per cent of the population lived, in 1910, in small communities of less than one hundred houses, because of the high amount of subdivision of agricultural land. Secondly, there was a special migration pattern of young males to foreign countries for a period of 10 to IS years (Tapinos, 1966). It is possible, then, that a man might emigrate at twenty years of age, return at thirty or thirty-five years, and not find a mate among relatives of his same age but find one among his sisters' or brothers' daughters. In any case, these two explanations have only hypothetical value because we do not have more detailed data regarding marriage types 12 and 22 (pedigree of each subtype, age of spouses, etc.) to enable us to confirm or reject our assumptions. But considering that this phenomenon--high frequency of marriages of Type 22 and especially of Type 12--occurs only in the provinces of northern Spain, we believe that our comments are justified. There must exist a sociocultural pattern (social traditions, special features in the transmission of property, etc.), and a socioeconomic condition (socioeco-

nomic structure, division of the agricultural land, etc.) which influence their marriage patterns so as to create such a situation (Livi-Bacci, 1968).
Though the behavior of the consanguinity coefficient is the same for the four regions, some heterogeneity is noted in the proportions of each type of consanguineous marriage relative to total consanguineous marriages (Table 5). In regions B and C, first cousin marriages are more than 50 per cent of all consanguineous marriages, while in regions A and D the percentage is lower and nearer to that of second cousins. Since, it is known that first cousin marriages contribute to a a value four times that contributed by second cousin marriages, the coefficient of consanguinity will depend heavily on the ratio of first cousin to second cousin marriages. This fact, again, can explain the precise ordering of the regions with respect to a: in fact, among the "less developed" regions, A shows a value of a greater than B, and among the "higher developed" regions D shows a value greater than C. The reason for this different relationship be-

tion density remains, as for the whole of Spain, the variable with greatest weight for first cousin marriages and, even more, for second cousin marriages. The birth rate is positively correlated with consanguinity, but with almost no contribution for regions B and D, the high birth rate regions. The marriage rate has no influence whatsoever. More variable is the behavior of the death rate which changes sign and weight according to the regions, showing a significant positive correlation in region A, a significant negative correlation in B and D (high death rate regions), no contribution toR2 in C, but a considerable one in D, both for first and second cousin marriages. In general, the coef-

ficient of determination does not have a very high value, being only slightly over 50 per cent for some of the regions and less than 50 per cent for the rest.
The demographic variables, then, provide little information and so does the subdivision into zones, since these do not show clearly consistent differences from each other. The demographic variables do not show any constant significant relationship with consanguinity, with the single exception of population density. There is some suggestion of a negative correlation between consanguinity and socioeconomic development, but a more detailed analysis taking into account other factors such as altitude, isolate size, urbanization and de-
