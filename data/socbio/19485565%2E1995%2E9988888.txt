ABSTRACT: Around the world, populations have experienced shortages of one sex or the other at marriageable ages, as a result of mortality declines. The solutions to this problem vary with the cultural context. Declines in the spousal age difference and increases in dowry payments (India) and polygamy (Africa) are two adjustments to a disequilibrium in the marriage market. We hypothesize that in Brazil the marriage market finds its balance by "recycling" men through highly unstable informal unions. Using census and 1984 survey data, we establish the relationship between a marriage squeeze and the increase in informal marriage. Census data and a competing-risks analysis of marriage choice provide evidence that a marriage squeeze has affected both the chances of marrying at all and the type of marriage entered.

An over- or under-supply of men or women in the marriage market brings about a situation which is referred to as a "marriage squeeze"--a shortage of one sex or the other in the age group in which marriage generally occurs. Such a disequilibrium is a consequence of a sharp increase in population growth rates either through a drop in mortality or a rise in fertility. This increase in the growth rate results in younger cohorts of a larger size than older cohorts, which, combined with the fact that women marry men who are on average older than they, results in a surplus of women in the marriage market.
The extent of the squeeze depends on the average age difference between husband and wife at marriage, the population growth rate, and the substitutability of other desired traits in the marriage market such as wealth and schooling. To put it in other words, how easy is it for an older woman to "make up" for her age with her other attributes (Schirm, 1986; Rao, 1991).

Various explanations have been offered for the frequency and persistence of age differences between men and women who marry. One of the most succinct and intuitively appealing is that of Guttentag and Secord (1983). They relate differences in age between husband and wives to power relations between the sexes. Power relations, in turn, result from a combination of "dyadic" and structural forces. Dyadic forces refer to the dynamics between the sexes brought about by the relative supply of men and women. Structural forces have to do with the relative status of one sex or the other in the society. It is probably the latter that determines the widely observed fact that husbands are generally several years older than their wives. How else could one explain a remarkably consistent age difference between spouses throughout the world?
Since most populations in developing countries have experienced fairly recent sharp declines in mortality and

tend to have large age differences at marriage, they have been subject to marriage squeezes. Depending on the social context, there are several solutions to this problem in the marriage market:
(1) The age at marriage for the two sexes could be adjusted, and people could marry others nearer to their own ages.
(2) Some women could remain single, as happened in Europe in the past (Watkins 1981) and as may be becoming more common in the United States.
(3) Men could marry more than one woman, as is done in polygynous Africa (Guttentag and Secord, 1983).
(4) Men could move between various unstable relationships, "sharing" themselves among several women over time.
Every society adapts to a marriage squeeze according to the institutional structure of its marriage market. In South Asia, where there is early and universal marriage and transactions between affinal households at the time of marriage are common, the marriage squeeze has resulted in a rise in the age of marriage of women and a consequent increase in dowry payments (Caldwell et al., 1983; Rao, 1993). In Sub-Saharan Africa where polygamy is a well-established institution, the squeeze has resulted in an increase in the prevalence of men with more than one wife (Guttentag and Secord, 1983; Goldman and Pebley, 1989).
In this paper we explore the fourth adaptation to a marriage squeeze-- the faster "recycling" of men through relatively unstable informal unions. We hypothesize that this mechanism explains, at least in part, the rise in

informal marriage in Brazil and may be related to an increase in marital instability.
We make an important assumption here, namely that men are more likely than women to prefer informal marriages, while women in general prefer formal marriage. This assumption makes sense when one thinks about differences in sex roles. Men might well prefer informal unions because their obligations are less well-defined, and they can more easily dissolve the unions. Women prefer legal unions because they provide greater economic support and protection.1 Fieldwork in Brazil conducted by one of the authors (Greene, 1991) corroborates the fact that most women in consensual unions have resigned themselves to their circumstances, while the men had generally not thought about doing things otherwise.
We argue that women with less power are more likely to end up in marriages which they do not care for, i.e., consensual unions. Yet if power is the issue, why is it that men of higher socioeconomic status are not more likely than their poorer counterparts to enter informal marriages? The reason is that in the upper classes formal marriage is more common, due in part to the legal constraints of property ownership and so on. Social classes
1The idea that informal marriage is influenced by the human capital and other resources available to men and women is also explored by GrossbardShechtman (1982) in her analysis of the determinants of informal marriage in Guatemala. In another paper (1985), Grossbard-Schechtman has hypothesized that the rise in the incidence of cohabitation in the United States could be due to a marriage squeeze.

are fairly endogamous. Our argument looks at a pattern visible within social classes rather than the one observed by making comparisons acrosssocial class (see Rao and Greene, 1990).
BACKGROUND
HISTORY OF MARRIAGE IN BRAZIL
Informal or consensual unions have been common historically in Latin America, and Brazil is no exception. Throughout Brazil's history of colonization, slavery, and consequent racial intermingling, informal unions have been a viable alternative to formal marriage. The church tried to ignore the Portuguese men who, though married to women who had stayed in Portugal, often took Native American wives. In parts of Brazil, slaves were not allowed to marry and, throughout the country, the commonplace unions between white masters and black women were never formalized. People living in remote areas were often too isolated to seek legal or religious sanction for their marriages. Race, socioeconomic characteristics, and other factors have been offered as explanations for the widespread tradition of informal marriage in Brazil (Henriques, 1980; Berquó and Loyola, 1984; Goldani, 1981; Silva, 1979; Mortara, 1956; Heredia and Heredia, 1983; Quinteiro, 1988; Kogut, 1976; Berquó, 1987).
Consensual unions form a substantial proportion of all unions in Brazil. In 1960, for instance, the first time the Brazilian census included "consensual union" as a marital category, 3.7 per cent of women older than 15 placed themselves in that category. By 1980,

this proportion had increased to about 10 per cent. Figure 1 shows the change in the proportion of informal marriages over time by region.
As for growth and the balance of fertility and mortality in Brazil, between 1950 and 1960 expectation of life at birth rose from 43.6 to 49.6 years. In the next decade, it rose to 53.4 years; and in the next, to nearly 62 years (Wood and Carvalho, 1988). The most rapid gains have taken place during the past twenty years, and this fact has great significance for the population profile today. Another important point is that the mortality decline was not felt the same way throughout the population. The sharp and recent mortality decline resulted from great improvements in socioeconomic conditions during the 1970's (Wood and Carvalho, 1988). Changes would have been felt the most among people of lower socioeconomic status who stood to gain the most in terms of expectation of life.
It was not until 1980 that population growth rates began to decline due to reductions in fertility. We believe that these vital events and the increase in informal marriage are not coincidental. We believe that the increase in the population growth rate directly contributed to a rise in informal unions, which have been integrally related to instability.
A related argument has been made about the proportions of women of different ages who are not currently married (who may be single, divorced, separated, or widowed). These proportions also have increased with time:
Those who never married, those who separated and never remarried, those

who were widowed and did not marry again, in short, the most varied conjugal paths taken, associated with the excess of women in Brazil, with the increase in differential mortality by sex, the preference of men for younger women for marriage and remarriage, and the growing volume of separations, all of this explains the pyramid of the non-married (Oliveira and Berquó, 1985, p. 5).
Oliveira and Berquó further argue that women have children by men and then content themselves with "truncated" families, without the presence of a spouse, all as a result of the marriage squeeze. The possibility that an everincreasing proportion of single women explains the situation in the marriage market is not corroborated by census data, as we can see in Figure 2.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF INFORMAL
UNIONS
Informal unions tend to be unfavorable to women, and this effect is stronger as one goes down the economic scale. The reason is that in the eventuality of a divorce, women have less or no financial support. The fact that women generally earn less than men-- and are further handicapped in that they are generally responsible for any children born in the union--means that in the United States women drop insocioeconomic class as they get divorced (McLanahan, 1989). In a predominantly Catholic society where divorce is difficult or unaffordable, consensual unions are far easier to break off than religious unions. Fieldwork interviews indicate that informal unions may be

preferred by men for these very reasons (Greene, 1991).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We examine our hypothesis with a unique retrospective survey of a 0.5 per cent sample of the population of Brazilian households. A National Household Survey (PNAD) is taken every year, with a different theme explored each time. The theme of the 1984 PNAD was marriage and fertility (FIBGE, 1987; Lazo, 1988). Women were asked about the details of their marital and birth histories. The data also include information on schooling and income. To these individual-level data, we have added state-level information on sex ratios and rates of labor

force participation dating back to 1950, thus giving both temporal and spatial variability in the aggregate data.
Given the extent of heterogeneity in marriage patterns in Brazil and variations,in the ages at marriage of men and women, it is impossible to find an index of the marriage squeeze that accurately reflects the pool of potential marital partners. Thus, we do not attempt to do so. We instead construct a measure of the age structure of the population that includes most of the range within which marriage-age differences mayfit.Wedivide the number of men between the ages of 25 and 34 by the number of women 15to 24. This measure is admittedly exaggerated, but it provides us with more variation across time and region than alternative

specifications. It also proved the most sensitive measure in terms of providing the most precise estimates in predicting both marriage and divorce.2
One problem with the 1984 PNAD survey--and with most demographic surveys (Pollak, 1990; Bergstrom and Lam, 1989)--is that it does not provide the corresponding marital histories of men, thus preventing us from directly measuring the relative rates of recycling. Another problem is that the information on the previous unions of a woman does not include any more information on her spouse at the time other than his age at marriage. This lack of data prevents us from doing a full analysis of how considerations of spouse "quality" interact with the decision to enter an informal union. While unions that are currently surviving have complete information on both husbands and wives, doing an analysis only of currently surviving unions would introduce a strong selectivity bias as consensual unions have a high probability of dissolving. Thus, our analysis includes information from both past and current unions.
We present evidence from both the PNAD survey and from Brazilian censuses to track trends in marriage patterns, marriage age differences, and relative rates of divorce between men and women. We then present results from a logistic analysis of choosing between formal and informal unions. Following, we present a discrete time competing-risks analysis (Allison, 1982) of marriage timing and choice of the type of union.
2We do not provide estimates of models with other marriage squeeze measures but these are available from the authors upon request.

RESULTS
Table 1 shows the trends in proportions of formal and informal marriages across each successive marriage cohort. It is clear that with each cohort, consensual unions have become a substantially larger proportion of all marriages.
Table 2 shows the trends in the proportion of unions of different types across regions. Before the 1960 census, women who were in consensual unions were considered either single or married, depending on their exact circumstances and how they answered the questions of the census-taker. One can see considerable regional variation in the incidence of informal marriage in Brazil. The North had the highest proportions of women in consensual unions in 1960, and also in 1970. The Northeast and Center West had the next highest levels of informal marriage in 1970. In 1980 and in 1984, according to the PNAD survey data, the Northeast, Southeast, and Center West had comparable levels of consensual unions, higher than in the past, but not quite as high as in the North. The regional variation is related to the distribution of racial and socioeconomic groups throughout Brazil, as well as regional histories and economic systems that are widely divergent.
We discussed above some of the solutions to the problem of constriction in the marriage market. If recycling is the solution in Brazil, men must pass through more unions than women. This relative instability of consensual unions means that a reduction in the age difference between partners is not required to resolve the inequities of the marriage squeeze. Those couples who

numbers in this sort of union. The mean age difference between husband and wife is consistently lower in formal marriages, lending credence to the idea that the solution to the marriage squeeze found by those who will only enter formal marriages is to find partners closer to their own ages.
One can think of the Brazilian marriage market as being broken into two subgroups--those who stick to formal unions, and those who will enter informal unions. The marriage squeeze causes couples who will form only formal unions to reduce gaps in their ages at marriage as they do not have the "recycling" option to ensure that everyone will have a marital partner at least once. Table 3 shows that in informal marriages, the husband is more likely to be much older than husbands in formalized marriages. This finding suggests different mechanisms of reaching an equilibrium in these two marriage markets. This bifurcation in the marriage market may partly exist because many consensual unions are second or higher order unions, in which men have often had more previous experience than women. The level of informal marriage by order of the marriage (for women) appears in Figure 4. It is clear that many informal marriages are second or higher order unions; informal unions do, however, make up an important proportion of first marriages.
The more intense the marriage squeeze, the more important the use of informal marriage to even out the marriage market. This is what we see in Figure 5, which plots the proportion of women in informal marriages by increasing sex ratios by each of four marriage cohorts. What we see here is that

as the sex ratio increases, i.e., as the supply of men in relation to women becomes more plentiful, women are less likely to enter informal marriages. It appears that a more balanced ratio of potential husbands and wives increases the prevalence of formal marriages which tend to be longer lasting (Goldman and Pebley, 1981).
LOGISTIC ANALYSIS OF TYPE OF
MARRIAGE
We first analyze the probability of women choosing consensual unions. The dependent variable in these results is dichotomous, being 1 if a woman entered an informal marriage, and 0 if she entered a formal marriage (Aldrich and Nelson, 1984). The results are presented in Table 4 (first unions) and Table 5 (second and higher order unions).
We will focus on the results most important to a marriage squeeze argument. Controlling for other possible causes, we find that the sex ratio has a negative and significant effect on the likelihood of entering an informal union. As the sex ratio increases and there are more men available in the

The variable for male unemployment appears to have a distorted positive coefficient, which may result from its correlation with the activity rates.3 We included only the unemployment of men because it is so highly correlated with that of women, and we simply wanted a measure of the economic situation at the time. When economic times are bad, less expensive and more spontaneous and unstable informal marriages seem to be preferred over formal marriage.

wise have initiated new formal marriages, compromised and lived in informal unions. To acknowledge this important legal change, a dummy variable for marriages which took place after 1979 was created. While it appears not to have a particularly strong effect on the choice of first marriage, the positive effect is in the expected direction. Some of the effect of the dummy variable marking 1979 and after may be stolen away by the control for year of marriage. With each passing year, a woman is more likely to enter an informal first marriage. The more traditional attitudes toward marriage one might expect from an older woman may account for the fact that the higher the age at marriage, the lower the likelihood of entering an informal union.

The controls for race (the reference category is White) have the expected effects. Asians are very unlikely to enter consensual unions, being more traditional in their marriage patterns. Black and mulatta women are considerably more likely to enter informal marriages than are white women. This finding may have something to do with their regional concentration and constraints in the regional marriage markets.
The number of children born previous to the marriage has a positive and substantial effect on the chances of entering an informal marriage, even when controlling for whether or not a woman was pregnant at the time of marriage. Having children may put women at a disadvantage when they are looking for a new partner. Being pregnant at the time of marriage has a positive effect on entering an informal union, perhaps because the whole sequence of pregnancy and marriage is less planned.
Schooling substantially decreases the likelihood of entering an informal marriage. This finding relates back to the cross-class pattern coexisting with an intra-class pattern. Years of schooling may be a proxy for general socioeconomic factors which relate to property and thus to the need to formalize a marriage. Furthermore, schooling may indicate greater power of a woman to negotiate a marriage on the terms she wishes.
Living in an urban area is another factor that clearly raises the likelihood of marrying into a consensual union rather than a formal marriage. Historically, consensual unions were most common among the rural poor, while they are now increasingly common

among women in cities. More and more, consensual unions are being used as experimental marriages by urban women, whether they are financially independent or not.
To touch briefly on the different findingswith regard to entering an informal second marriage, overall, the effects have the same signs but have lost in significance. Certain variables should be emphasized because these are second or higher order marriages. The dummy variable for whether a woman married after 1979 seems to have the most explanatory power, which almost certainly has to do with an increase in dissolution at that time. The number of children born previously has an important positive effect on entering a consensual union, and most of these women probably do have children from previous marriages.
COMPETING RISKS ANALYSIS
The results of the logistic analysis must be interpreted as providing estimates of the conditional probability of entering a formal or informal union once individuals have made the decision to stay together. Table 5 presents two more realistic models of the marriage decision in a competing risks model, where the chances of entering a formal marriage, informal marriage, or staying single are assumed to be part of the same choice. This method mixes the concept of a life table with a logistic regression (Allison, 1982, 1984; Hoffman and Duncan, 1988; W. Greene, 1988). For every year that a woman is single, she can decide to remain single or to enter one or another sort of marriage. These are mutually exclusive options, and she is exposed to the risk of these different possibilities every year

until she marries, when she is no longer at risk.
The observations represent, in fact, the accumulated experience of women up until and including the year of marriage, or the total number of years in which they ran the risk of marrying, entering a consensual union, or remaining single. After marrying, a woman's experience is no longer included in this analysis.
The characteristics that vary throughout the life of the person (like age, for example) also vary in the analysis. Other fixed characteristics (like race) are obviously the same for all of a person's years of experience. The dependent variable, marital status, has three categories: "O" for a woman who remains single that year, " 1 " for a woman who enters a formal marriage, and "2" for a woman who enters a consensual union.
Model 1 of the analysis, which focuses on culture and individual resources, shows that race has strong effects on marriage and marriage choice. Black women are less likely to enter formal marriages and more likely to enter informal marriages than are white women (the coefficient is --0.622 for formal marriages, and 0.392 for informal ones). The situation is nearly the same for mixed-race women. Asian women, on the other hand, are not that different from white women with respect to entering formal marriage versus remaining single (the coefficient for formal marriage is not significant). They are, however, much less likely to enter informal marriages (-2.398). The fact that the signs of the coefficients change when we are looking at formal and informal marriage suggests that certain options are more salient

depending on these women's cultural background. Clearly informal marriage is much more of a possibility for black and mixed-race women than for white or Asian women.
The measures of structural constraints in this first model, controlling for urban residence and birth year, are similar in reducing the chances of entering a formal marriage and increasing the chances of entering a consensual union (the coefficients for urban residence are -1.189 for formal marriage, and 0.460 for informal; those of year of birth are -0.011 and 0.058, respectively). We view these highly significant factors as measures of the weakened influence of tradition on behavior over time and space.
Individual resources also appear very predictive of the chances of entering a formal or informal marriage versus remaining single. Years of schooling make any kind of marriage less likely, but the effect is greater in reducing the chances of entering informal marriage (the coefficients are --0.032 for formal marriages, and --0.133 for consensual unions). Schooling affects both the way someone spends her time (whether or not she is in school), and her future expectations (through investment in human capital and later work experience and wealth).
We have tried to control for the role of wealth by including a dummy variable for unearned income, which has the surprising effect of reducing the likelihood of entering a formal marriage and increasing the likelihood of entering an informal one. This goes completely against our expectations, and indeed, against what the literature on the relationship of socioeconomic

Vol. 42, No. 1-2

factors to marriage choice suggests. Clearly there is heterogeneity among the group of women who enter informal marriages that is not being captured in this model. It is also possible, all else being equal, the rare women who have greater financial independence may prefer informal marriage.
The final measures of individual resources in Model 1 are the age categories. These are counted as resources, because age is so clearly associated with other lifecourse events which affect the position from which a woman negotiates her marriage. Women ages 14 to 19 are equally less likely to marry than to remain single compared to the reference category of women ages 20 to 24 (-0.871 and -0.860, for formal and consensual unions, respectively). Starting at age 25, however, the effects of age on entering a formal or informal marriage begin to diverge. While women are less and less likely to enter formal marriages compared to the reference group after this age, they are more likely to enter consensual unions until they are 35-39 (-1.533 for formal and 0.188 for informal unions). After that age, women are again less likely to enter informal marriages than remain single compared to the reference group. It appears that informal marriage remains an option after the conventional ages for marriage have been passed by, while formal marriage is more rigidly contained in the early 20's.
Model 2 adds structural factors which attenuate some of the other influences, including the sex ratio, region, and female activity rates. The proportion of women working appears to reduce the chances of entering a formal marriage compared to remaining

single, while increasing the likelihood of entering a consensual union (-3.945 and 3.167 for the two types of marriage, respectively). The coefficients for the sex ratio, of most concern to us, show that a greater supply of men substantially increases the chances of entering a formal marriage rather than of remaining single (0.966). At the same time, it appears to have no effect on distinguishing entry into informal marriage versus remaining single. If not marrying and entering an informal marriage are influenced in the same way by the supply of potential male partners, it would seem that informal marriage is more closely related to singlehood than formal marriage is.
The effect of race is reduced by the addition of regional controls, partly because of the concentration of blacks in the Northeast and whites in the South. Women from the Northeast are somewhat less likely to enter formal marriages and somewhat more likely to enter informal ones than stay single than are women in the rest of the country (-0.095 for formal marriage, 0.173 for consensual union). This effect is greatly magnified among women living in the North, where the chances of entering an informal marriage appear to be the highest in the country (-0.309 and 0.633, respectively). This effect is mirrored in the South, where women are considerably more likely to enter formal marriages, rather than remain single, than elsewhere (0.154 and -0.037).
The effects of personal socioeconomic resources are quite similar to those in Model 1, with years of schooling reducing the chances of entering any sort of marriage relative to remaining single. Having unearned income

again makes women less likely to enter formal marriages and more likely to enter informal ones, rather than to remain single. This finding may be due in part to the fact that the unearned income variable is a measure of current wealth which we impute to these women in the past.
Once again, being in the youngest age group reduces women's chances of marrying at all, relative to the group of women ages 20 to 24. From age 25 to age 40, however, women are more likely to enter informal marriages than remain single relative to the reference group. The negative effects of age on the chances of entering a formal marriage become stronger and stronger, and are always highly significant.
A final piece of evidence that a recycling mechanism may be the solution to a marriage squeeze in Brazil is presented in Figure 6. The figure uses Brazilian census data from 1980. On the X axis, we have plotted the state-level sex ratios, the number of males aged 25 to 29 divided by the number of females aged 15 to 19. On the F axis we plot the ratio of divorce rates for men and women. The measure of the relative rates of divorce for men and women uses census data. The index we employ
is
( # Divorced Men \ # Ever Married Men I
# Divorced Women # Ever Married Women
We can see that as the state-level sex ratio increases, this index increases. This finding indicates that as the supply of men increases, the divorce rates of men become more like those of women. In other words, as the deficit of men in the marriage market is reduced, the easier it becomes for

women to marry, to stay married, or to remarry, just as it becomes more difficult for men to achieve these same goals.
CONCLUSIONS
It is hard to tell a two-sex story from data collected about the experiences of only one. The hypothesis we have tried to test should ideally have been directly examined with data on the marital histories of both men and women. However, in the absence of such data, we believe that the patchwork of evidence that we have assembled from the PNAD survey and Brazilian censuses, in their totality, tell a convincing story. In the context of Brazil's high degree of marital instability, the marriage squeeze has been resolved with the increased recycling of men through multiple unions. As informal unions are the most unstable type of union, this process has resulted in an increase in the incidence of informal marriage.
Given the high levels of marital instability in Brazil, it is clear that informal unions and the associated "recycling" of marriage partners, especially of men, together form a reasonable solution to the marriage squeeze problem. This particular response to the marriage squeeze may be observed in other Latin American societies with high incidences of informal marriage and high degrees of marital instability. Other societies with different constraints on the marriage market and different marriage structures have reacted in other ways, with reductions in age differences between spouses and increases in rates of polygyny. However, what we have tried to show is that increases in the rate at which unions are formed and dissolved may be yet
