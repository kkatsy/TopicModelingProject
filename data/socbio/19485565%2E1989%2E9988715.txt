ABSTRACT: The background characteristics of infant deaths which have been certified by physicians as due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) are examined. Two alternative models for explaining SIDS deaths are considered. The first views SIDS solely in medical/biological terms, while the second emphasizes the role played by social and cultural factors, either as contributing conditions or as factors in the misattribution of SIDS as the cause of death where other conditions are actually present. Data are based on linked birth and death certificates for the 1980-82 cohort of live births in Florida, which have been merged with NCHS reports of multiple cause of death. Analysis suggests a pattern of SIDS reporting which varies inversely with maternal education, prenatal care, and race/ethnicity. This pattern suggests either that social factors affect the etiology of the syndrome to a greater degree than would be expected from the medical/biological model or that deaths to infants of lower socioeconomic status are attributed to SIDS more often than warranted.

Despite a continuing decline in the rate of infant mortality in the United States, the number and rate of infant deaths are regarded by everyone as still unacceptably high. In an effort to identify components of the infant mortality rate that can be reduced significantly through policy interventions, various medical, epidemiological, and demographic researchers have focused their attention on trends in particular medical causes of infant deaths as well as on characteristics of infants and their mothers that are associated with infant mortality.
One intriguing finding has been that the cause of death known as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (or SIDS) has not been declining and, in fact, has been increasing in many populations.
In highly-advanced countries, SIDS is now the most common single cause of

death after the perinatal period and often is more common than all other causes of death combined at the age of three months (Knight, 1983, p. 20). It ranks second only to injuries as the most frequent cause of death in children less than 15years of age. Between 6,000 and 7,000 babies a year fall victim to this cause of death in the United States (Bergman, 1986, xi).
What is especially disturbing about SIDS, sometimes called cot death or crib death, is that it is an unspecific cause of death. SIDS deaths have been defined as "the sudden death of any infant or young child which is unexpected by history and in which a thorough postmortem fails to demonstrate an adequate cause for the death" (J. Bruce Beckwith, cited in Knight, 1983, p. 16).
Although SIDS retains an aura of mystery in media reports, and hence in

the public mind, a'great deal of information has been compiled through various studies which provide some clues as to the nature of SIDS cases and possible general explanations of them. One theme that runs through many of these studies is the presence of certain medical conditions, one set of which has substantial support as an associated set of physiological factors. A second theme relates to identifiable differences in personal and environmental characteristics of SIDS cases and other causes of infant deaths.
In this paper, we briefly review the existing literature covering these two themes, and then examine the characteristics of SIDS cases in Florida based on an ongoing study of infant mortality in the state. We conclude with reflections on the alternative explanations for SIDS, considering not only medical and environmental factors but also the nature of reporting practices of infant deaths by physicians.
REVIEW OF STUDIES
Knight (1983, p. 66) reported the existence of well over 2,000 references in medical journals on the subject of SIDS. The vast majority of these advance hypotheses about physiological factors that one or more researchers have shown to have an empirical connection to SIDS. Included among these factors are allergy to cow's milk, virus infection, magnesium deficiency, vitamin E deficiency, selenium deficiency, spinal hemorrhage, hypothermia (or low body temperature), carbon dioxide pooling, heart conduction defects, house mite allergy, bacterial infection, botulism, errors of metabolism, failure of the immune system, sodium overload, and hypernatremia (Knight, 1983, p. 74-88; Valdes-Dapena, 1980).

None of these explanations have remained uncontested. Contradictory findings have been reported for many of these factors, and arguments for these factors as single-cause explanations are unsubstantial. It is more likely that they can be contributory factors in a range of cases.
A more persistent physiological explanation of SIDS, discovered in a large number of investigations, incorporates the following sequence of events: Certain infants have a tendency to prolonged sleep apnoea, or absence of breathing, for more than 15 seconds. There is a tendency for hypoxia (a deficiency of oxygen) to begin if sleep apnoea is unduly prolonged. At the same time, carbon dioxide accumulates in the blood. Once an anoxic state occurs because of apnoea, the anoxia itself prolongs the apnoea and a descending spiral of respiratory activity begins. Virus infections may act on this apnoea-anoxia cycle, with the consequence that this can rapidly lead to sudden failure of the heart (Knight, 1983, p. 88-93). It has been suggested that this cycle may occur outside of sleep, although the sleeping state will make the baby more vulnerable to the condition (Weinstein et al., 1983).
Not all episodes of this cycle will lead to death. The notion of a "near-miss SIDS" refers to cases where a baby who has ceased breathing and who seems to have died suddenly and unexpectedly has its life saved by timely intervention, merely by the mother scooping up the baby in a panic and rushing off to the nearest neighbor, doctor, or accident department of the local hospital (Knight, 1983,101).
Existing studies have specified the circumstances and characteristics of SIDS deaths. A significantly high risk of SIDS is associated with the season of the

year (winter months), the day of the week (holidays and weekends, especially Sunday), the time of day (early morning hours), the prevailing temperature (low night temperatures), the region of the country (varies with coroner's or physicians' practices), age of the infant (1 to 3 months), sex of the infant (male), maternal age (younger mothers), gestation (prematurity), family size (greater number of siblings), plurality of births (twins), previous birth interval (short), birthweight (low), marital status of mother (unmarried), smoking behavior of mother (smoker), maternal blood pressure (fast drop in late gestation), previous medical condition (respiratory infection), social class (lower), and postnatal care (previously in intensive care center) (Knight, 1983; MacFarlane, 1982; MacFarlene and Gardner, 1982; Carpenter and Gardner, 1982; Adelstein et al., 1982; Bergman, 1986; Naeye, 1983; Spiers and Wang, 1976; Peterson et al., 1979; Babson and Clarke, 1983; Getts, 1981; Kahn et al., 1986; Riordan and Grindstaff, 1987).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
For the past two years, the authors and colleagues have been engaged in a large-scale study of infant mortality in Florida, with support from NICHD. The data set combines linked birth and death certificate information for the 1980-82 cohort of 412,876 live births in Florida with multiple-cause coding of death records provided by NCHS. Computer work to produce the merged data was performed by the investigators under an agreement with the Florida Department of Vital Statistics. Further information about the process of creating the data tapes can be found in previously-issued reports (Nam et al.,

1987; Eberstein et al., 1987; and Nam et al.,1987).
The data file incorporates a wide range of analytical variables, including prior or background factors such asrace/ ethnicity, maternal education, marital status, and rural/urban residence; proximate factors such as birthweight, prenatal care, interval since last birth or pregnancy, gestational age, hospital delivery, maternal age, prior fetal or infant death, plurality, and infant's sex; and immediate factors such as age at death and cause of death.
Since cause of infant death was one of the principal lines of interest in our study, we undertook to classify medical causes in several ways. All of the variations were based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (World Health Organization, 1977). The four alternative cause-ofdeath classifications we used were the underlying cause of death, which is derived from the sequence of causes listed by a physician on the death certificate and identifies what is presumed to be the cause of death that triggered the morbid episode leading to death; total mentions of causes, in which a cited condition is counted as a cause regardless of whether or not it is designated as the underlying cause; the principal diagnostic cause, that which is characterized by the typical priority in a physician's medical diagnosis; and cause combinations, the configuration of those conditions mentioned on the death certificate.
With regard to SIDS, these distinctions are not highly meaningful because, in our study, additional conditions were reported for only a small percentage of SIDS cases. This absence of other conditions is very unusual in that all other causes of death were frequently reported in combination with other conditions on the certificate. This fact alone

when analysis is restricted to postneonatal deaths (data not shown). We discuss the implications of these findings in more detail below.
CONCLUSIONS
Our findings support a growing body of evidence concerning the characteristics of of SIDS deaths. Although SIDS deaths can be associated with high-risk physiological conditions, most often a syndrome that incorporates respiratory ailments which increase mortal risks during sleep periods, the selectivity of social and environmental characteristics of SIDS infants and their mothers indicate relatively high frequency of social deprivation and relative neglect.
Not only do SIDS cases load more on high-risk categories than do all births or all infant deaths, but they resemble deaths from accidents more than the congenital anomalies examined here in terms of these high-risk category loadings.
Reports of numerous SIDS cases in which the infant had previously been in a neonatal intensive care unit but later released also point to medically viable babies who did not receive appropriate infant care.
The picture one can derive from this information is one of mildly sick infants who do not receive sufficient attention at times when such attention is most needed. On the other hand, despite overall selectivity on high-risk factors, a high proportion of SIDS cases do not have high-risk category associations. This suggests that no single explanation will suffice to account for all reported SIDS deaths.

Given the widespread absence of other morbid conditions on the death certificate for SIDS cases, it seems reasonable to conclude that perhaps many physicians assign infant deaths to the SIDS category when diagnosis is uncertain or in order to mercifully conclude a medical investigation, especially if the possibility exists of maternal or familial neglect of an infant.
SIDS deaths are rapidly losing the aura of mystery that was attached to them some years ago. In light of the findings from this study and many others that have explored the characteristics of SIDS cases, it is incumbent upon the physicians and other persons who diagnose such deaths to be more specific about associated medical conditions and about the social and environmental circumstances which surround these cases.
Devices to monitor the respiratory problems of infants during periods of sleep or periods when they are awake but left unattended are now serving to convert many SIDS deaths into nearmisses. It now remains for both the medical and social service sectors of our society to put more emphasis on facilitating the proper care of infants in prenatal as well as postnatal situations so that mortality crises for infants now being labeled "SIDS" can be further reduced.
