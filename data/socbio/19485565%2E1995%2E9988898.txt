ABSTRACT:The mating patterns of the Abbad tribe in Jordan are examined based on empirical data obtained from four male samples representing the different levels of the Abbad's substructure as well as on nonempirical information and pedigrees collected during field work. From the total matings in each sample, at least one-third were first-cousin marriages, and some 90 per cent were marriages within the Abbad. The estimated inbreeding coefficient (mean F = 0.018) was relatively high. Relatedness, geographic locality, maternal links, and the type of economy are suggested as the factors which influenced the mating behavior of the Abbad. The study also indicates the vital role of matings in the formation and make-up of the tribe. The Abbad tribe could be described as an endogamic population consisting of more or less inbreeding subunits.

Arab tribes define themselves as such, Qabila or A'shira in Arabic. They include a diverse range of agricultural, trade, and fisher societies alongside nomadic communities (Oppenheim, 1939, 1943; Dickson, 1951; Lewis, 1987). Arab tribes have been described as egalitarian, patrilineal, segmentary, kin groups that often display complex structures, involving many related or nonrelated agnatic lines. The substructures of the tribe are grouped and organized in a manner governed by cultural and historical as well as geographic factors (Oppenheim, 1939; Musil, 1958; Murphy and Kasdan, 1959; Peters, 1960; Abbadi, 1986).
At any tribal level, each unit is considered to be autonomous, so that the tribe can be understood to be "a definition of identity against other similar units of self definition" (Lancaster and Lancaster, 1992). According to some authors, Arab tribes represent loose structured political entities based on

leadership (e.g., Helm, 1968; Khoury and Kostiner, 1990). Tapper (1990) preferred to refer to them as "chiefships," not as tribes.
Relationships between groups or individuals in an Arab tribe are governed by their relatedness, i.e., genealogy. Lancaster (1981) distinguished between two types of genealogy, macroand micro-genealogy. Macro- or formal genealogy describes the relationship between the tribal substructures in terms of descent or as a projection of the past, hence maintaining a framework for the tribal community as a whole. The micro- or generative genealogy legitimates or explains present relationships within the substructures of the tribe.
Data on the patterns and behavior of matings in Arab tribes are scarce. They were provided by a few studies that described them as endogamic groups (Peters, 1960; Katakura, 1977; Lancaster, 1981). Patrilateral cousin marriages were (Murphy and Kasdan,

1959) and are the predominant mating form, whereby second- and thirddegree types are considered commoner than first-cousin marriage types (Mundy and Smith, 1990; Lancaster and Lancaster, 1992).
The aim of the present study is to investigate the mating structure of the Abbad tribe in Jordan. Based on empirical and nonempirical data, factors influencing matings as well as the role of matings in the makeup of the tribe are considered. The present study is intended to verify the definability of the Abbad tribe as a breeding population. Investigation of its genetic structure follows.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Field work was carried out during 1986 to 1989 to obtain social, demographic, and biological data from the Abbad tribe. Data were collected exclusively through house visits (over 600), which were arranged and attended by various contact persons from the tribe. This arrangement provided a state of confidence for both interviewer and interviewed and proved to be valuable for ascertaining the relevance of the obtained information and samples. Previous reports on the Abbad tribe were relatively scarce (Oppenheim, 1943; Musil, 1958; Peake, 1958) so that additional information about the tribe had to be gathered during the field work phase through interviews, documents, and assays, provided by many "genealogists" from Abbad.
To provide a comprehensive understanding of the structure of the Abbad and to avoid linguistic discrepancies, a

simplified terminology will be adopted in the present paper to refer to the different levels of tribal structure (its relevance is limited to the present case study). The terminology is based on how the single agnatic lineages are organized. A tribe can include one or more independent patrilateral "lineages," segmented into related clans. Lineages can be arranged in "groups" or even "subgroups." Groups themselves can be allocated to "divisions" or "subdivisions" (Figure 1). The adopted "English" names for the different tribal substructures are either based on those given by Oppenheim (1943) or provided, in English, by the members of the tribe, excluding the Arabic "A/" definitive article. The term "territory" used here refers to the residence or concentration area of the tribe.
THE ABBAD TRIBE
The Abbad tribe (phonetically A'bbad) resides in the Balqa district in Jordan, in an area extending from the Jordan valley (300 meters below sea level) in the west to Wadi Sir, i.e., the Sir valley, on the Jordanian eastern heights (over 700 meters above sea level), and from Abu-Zigan in the north to Karama in the south (Figure 2). The Abbad's economy was and is primarily agricultural, and its members are now represented in all socioeconomic and vocational levels in Jordan.
Wadi Shua'ib represents the geographical demarcation between the Abbad's two divisions: the northern Abbad (Jrumiya) in the Jordan valley and the southern Abbad (Jburiya) in Wadi Sir and the areas surrounding the towns of Ira and Yerqa (Figure 2). The

nanim, and Sawalha groups (Figure 1). Except for the Manasir group, each of the Jrumiya groups consider itself to be unilineal. The Manasir, the largest Abbad group (ca. 15,000 individuals), is divided geographically into Manasir Wadi-Shta, at the eastern heights, and A'rdha Manasir in the Jordan valley

(Figures 1and 2). The group consists of four inclusive subgroups: the O'wana, the Nasasra, the Asalma, and the Manajla. The last resides only in WadiShta (Figure 1). The Khatalin of the Za'anif are the traditional chiefs of the Abbad.
Six groups are allocated to the Jburiya division: the Bqur, Rahamna, Jbara, Zyadat, Fqaha, and Zyoud. Most of these groups include a number of lineages (Figure 2). The Bqur and Jbara groups are considered to be the oldest units of the Abbad. The Bqur also represent the second level and the Muhairat lineage of the Fqaha the third level of the tribal leadership.
As a result of fusion and segmentation, the structure of the Abbad tribe has been in continuous change (even to the present time). A number of clans once affiliated to the same group later separated and are now building independent lineages or groups. For example, all lineages of the Fqaha were once attached to the Muhairat lineage (Oppenheim 1943), while the Yasdjin, A'raidha, and Nua'aimat of the Jrum subdivision used to form a single group. Common descent is claimed by a number of lineages of different groups from within the Abbad (e.g., A'lawin of the Zyadat group with the A'laiwat of the Jbara group) while others are related by descent to tribal structures outside Abbad (e.g., the Nua'aimat and the Sakarna of the Fqaha).
All the subunits of Abbad consider themselves to be Yeman, i.e., of southern Arab origin. It has been suggested that the tribe descended from the Djutham, an ancient and ancestral tribe of many Jordanian tribes (e.g., Beni-Sachr and Ajarma) (Abbadi,

1986), and that many of the affiliated groups resided in the Balqa region as early as the third century. Some of the present tribal subunits were explicitly reported to have resided in Balqa around the thirteenth century, e.g., the Bqur (Al-Qalqashandi, 1400) and the Nua'aimat (Hiitteroth and Abdelfattah, 1977). The history of the Abbad tribe before the thirteenth century is probably highly speculative.
The emergence of the present Abbad tribe from a multitude of tribal elements occurred some 250 years ago (Abbadi, 1986; Nabulsi, 1990), probably in a similar manner as for a number of tribes in the area, for example, the now widely dispersed Nua'aimat (Al-Qalqashandi, 1400; Oppenheim, 1943), the camel-herding Rwala tribe (Lancaster, 1981), and the BeniHassan (Tragon, 1993). Most of the Abbad's subunits used to be affiliated to the Beni-Mehdi tribe, which dominated the Balqa region between the thirteenth and the seventeenth century (Al-Qalqashandi, 1400; Peake, 1958; Hutteroth and Abdelfattah, 1977). In the middle of the seventeenth century, the Khatalin clan, supposedly Shammar from north Arabia, joined BeniMehdi. They later repudiated the connection and together with a number of smaller tribes and surrounding villages formed the Abbad (Abbadi, 1986).
During the first half of the nineteenth century, the Abbad were involved in a territorial struggle with neighboring tribes in Balqa. With the exception of the Fqaha and Zyoud groups, the tribe was forced to move to Bisan in north Palestine. There, the Abbad are said to have suffered high child mortality as a result of diseases. After twelve years, the tribe managed

Vol. 42, No. 3 - 4

to return to Balqa and has resided since then within its recent boundaries. By the end of the nineteenth century, a number of clans joined the Abbad and were allocated to the Zyoud and Fqaha. Also, a large part of the Manasir group moved from the Jordan valley up to Wadi Shta on the southeastern borders of the Abbad's territory (Figure 1). After Jordan's independence in 1946, land ownership was transferred from common wealth (state or tribal) to private property, and administrative changes in the infrastructures were introduced. This process is thought to have confined the different substructures of the Abbad to their villages or towns, thus enhancing the process of segmentation within the tribe.
During the last decades, the size of the Abbad tribe has markedly increased. Now, an estimated 120,000 individuals are affiliated to 76 agnatic lines or units, each ranging from 250 to more than 2,000 individuals. Population growth was variable among Abbad's substructures. While the Fqaha group has increased more than ten-fold to its present estimated size by about 1850, the Jrumiya groups now number fewer than they did before World War II as a result of regional epidemics and starvation during the 1940's.
METHODS
For empirical analysis, four male samples, representing the different levels of the Abbad's structure, were collected (Table 1). Proportional representation of the substructures in each sample was considered. The samples represent the Jrumiya division, the Jburiya division, the Manasir group,

and the Sakarna lineage of the Fqaha group (Figure 2). Sampling from the Sakarna lineage was based on a reconstructed family tree.
The average inbreeding coefficient (Rao, 1988) was calculated for each of the four samples, based on parental relatedness. As a result of complex cross-links and overlapping generations, consanguineous marriages beyond the first-cousin level were added as matings within the lineage. According to structural, geographic, and historical factors, three of the samples were further subdivided to construct a mating matrix, in order to obtain a more detailed picture of the mating patterns within the tribe and its substructures.
RESULTS
The rate of the various mating types, listed in Table 2, appear to be variable among the four Abbad samples. However, similar tendencies can be observed. From the total matings of each of the examined samples, at least one-third were marriages in the firstcousin category (from 32.1 per cent in the Manasir group to 47.3 per cent in the Sakarna lineage). Around half of the matings were within the paternal descent line, and nearly 90 per cent of the total marriages involved mates from within the Abbad. These mating patterns were reflected in the estimated relative inbreeding coefficients, which were lowest in the Manasir group (F = 0.0146) and highest in the Sakarna lineage (F = 0.0216).
According to the mating matrix (Table 3), the rate of marriages within each subunit was directly related to the represented structural level, e.g., the

rate ranged from 60 per cent in the A'widi clan of the Sakarna to 77.8 per cent in the Jrumiya division. Matings between the Abbad's substructures were observed to be unevenly distributed. In the Jrumiya division, they tended to be restricted to mates from within the same geographical area, i.e., the Jordan valley. The Jburiya groups--Bqur, Rahamna, Jbara, and Zyadat (BRJZ in Table 3)--displayed nearly similar geographic constrictions. In the case of the inclusive and widely dispersed Fqaha and Zyoud groups (FQ-ZY in Table 3), matings beyond their relevant units were nearly evenly distributed among Abbad's different subunits as well as among other neighboring populations. In general, geographic separation appeared to have affected matings between the Jrumiya and the Jburiya divisions, but not

between the Wadi-Shta and A'rdha Manasir (Table 3, Figure 2). On the agnatic line level, represented by the Sakarna, matings between the A'widi clan and the remaining Sakarna clans were clearly less frequent (7.5 per cent and 8.6 per cent, respectively) than those with the Fqaha and Zyoud groups (25 per cent and 25.7).
Exogamous matings were observed to be more common in groups residing on the borders of the Abbad's territory (e.g., 16.7 per cent in the Jrumiya division) than in those groups living within the tribe's heartland (e.g., 4.7 per cent in the Jburiya groups (BRJZ) living in Mahes, Ira, and Yerqa) (Figure 1).
The descent of the Sakarna lineage and the pedigree of some randomly selected families from the A'widi and A'skar clans are illustrated in Figure 3.

As a result of large family size, families were reduced to provide better perception. Only females with known spouses were considered in the graphic, representing less than 10 per cent of the total family tree.
Ahmad "Al-Sakran" is the ancestral father of the Sakarna lineage. At the turn of the nineteenth century, he sought refuge with the Windi tribe, in south Jordan, from which he married his second wife. The families of Ahmad's sons A'bdulla and A'bdulaziz, from the first wife, moved to Balqa and settled with the Abbad as part of the Fqaha group. From this family, the A'skar as well as six other clans emerged. The A'widi clan are the descendants of Ahmad's second marriage. The integration of the Sakarna in the Abbad was marked by frequent intermarriages with the Fqaha group as

well as with other elements from within the Abbad (Figure 3). This phase was followed by an apparent increase of patrilateral cousin marriages in the A'skar clan and of matrilateral parallel or cross-cousin marriages in the A'widi clan. A pedigree analysis confirmed these general trends in mating patterns of the Abbad as well as the otherwise untraceable marriages between the Sakarna lineage and the Manasir group (Figure 3, Table 3).
In the last two generations, the rate of cousin as well as exogamous marriages increased (Figure 3). Furthermore, from 41 newly married individuals (age 20-25 years) affiliated to different Abbad groups, 19 cases of patrilateral first-degree cousin marriages, 1 case of second-cousin marriage, and 20 exogamous marriages were registered.

DISCUSSION
The empirical observations suggest that the mating behavior of the Abbad tribe was primarily influenced by two factors: relatedness and geographic locality. The rate of the mating types in the tribe was directly related to the degree of relatedness between the individuals involved, while tribal affiliation and geographic distance appeared to have affected matings between the tribal subunits (Tables 2 and 3). The probability for any couple to marry decreases the less related they are (starting with first-degree_cousins) or the more distant, geographically and in their tribal affiliation they are.
Marriages in the first-cousin category were obviously more frequent in the Abbad than in the camel-herding Rwala tribe (Lancaster, 1981). The frequency of consanguineous marriages was nearly similar to the reported values in the Jordanian population (s=50 per cent). Yet, the rate of direct firstcousin marriages in the Abbad (17.3 per cent) was lower than the general estimation of 30 per cent in Jordan (Khoury and Massad, 1992). These observations are mirrored in the lower inbreeding coefficients in the Abbad (mean F = 0.018), compared with the estimated rates in the Jordanian (F s 0.0225) and in other Arab populations (Al-Awadi et al., 1985; Hamamy et al., 1989; Khoury and Massad, 1992; Nevo et al., 1992).
The mating behavior of the rural Abbad tribe can thus be described as occupying a middle position between the less sedentary and the urban populations in Jordan. This finding might imply that the primarily agricultural economy of the Abbad had affected its

matings, probably to keep the land within its groups. Similar unpublished observations on agricultural tribal populations in Jordan (e.g., the southern Nua'imat villages and parts of the Beni-Hassan tribe) and in Saudi Arabia (Katakura, 1977) strengthen this suggestion.
In Abbad, families belonging to single lineages or groups are often concentrated in one region. They are either widely dispersed over this area or build small clusters of a few houses in the vicinity of their cultivated land. In time, families grow larger. Depending on the available space, families move to, or use, the nearest empty land, so that the boundaries between the different groupings will intercept over time. In this process, the families or lineages often become involved in a process of reciprocal matings. The resulting mating types would then depend on the degree of relatedness between the neighboring families.
For example, the A'skar clan, which revealed a high incidence of patrilateral cousin marriages, resides in a relatively large fertile area in Wadi-Sir, while the A'widi, who joined Abbad at a later time, had to press themselves in the available spaces in between. This land use probably led to the observed frequent intratribal matrilaterally influenced matings by the A'widi (Figure 2,3). The previously described matings beyond the agnatic lines, as well as the recent high incidence of exogamous marriages in the Wadi-Shta Manasir (Table 3) can be related to these "neighborhood relationships."
In other cases, maternal links develop between neighboring units of different ancestry. Cross-marriages between families would result in the

172

emergence of new settlements, in which all members claim to be related, or even of common descent, regardless of their actual paternal descent (e.g., Mahes and Yerqa) (Figure 1). In this sense, previous observations of the regionally typical "one village, one 'tribe' or clan" (e.g., Gulick, 1953; Lutffiya, 1966) probably reflect similar situations.
Maternal links could also lead to the segmentation of descent lines. In the Sakarna lineage, the distinction of the clans was enhanced by differences in the maternal ancestry of the first generations. This segmentation was evident in the descent of each clan and not only in the A'widi clan (Figure 3). It might be relevant at this point to mention that some Sakarna members do not accept their common descent with the A'widi.
In extreme cases, subunits of the identical ancestries were found to be allocated to different groups in the Abbad. These subunits, traced to have segmented in a time prior to the Abbad, were attached to different tribal groupings with which they developed new relationships. When these groupings became part of the Abbad, recent relationships, achieved through maternal links, were more relevant for the segmented elements than the older, and often neglected, ancestral lines (e.g., the A'lawin of the Zyadat group and the A'laiwat of the Jbara group from the Jburiya division) (Figure 2).
Based on his study on the Rwala tribe, Lancaster (1981) concluded that mating behavior in an Arab tribe is adaptable to its necessities or viability and influenced by the "options and assets" the matings could provide for the individuals involved, i.e., cultural and

material continuity. Applying this concept to the Abbad, we can argue that throughfirst-cousinmarriages, families can maintain their share of land intact, while matings with the surrounding families are utilized to consolidate relationships and provide new options.
The structure of the Abbad tribe does not follow the genealogical manner and terms observed in different Arab tribes (e.g., Oppenheim, 1943; Peters, 1960; Al-Nassar, 1979; Lancaster, 1981), which interpret their history and structure in not necessarily real ancestral terms. As already mentioned, the Abbad evolved some 250 years ago from groups of different ancestry that resided in the same area and shared the same type of agricultural economy. The relatively young history of the tribe did not allow the development of a genealogical reasoned structure.
Tribesmen apply genealogical terms to describe or reason relationships between individuals or groups. Since genealogies are patrilateral, longstanding relations between individuals from different ancestral lines come to be attributed to common paternal descent. The Manasir subgroups claim common ancestry and often describe the relationships between the single agnatic lines in genealogical terms. Before joining the Abbad, matings between Manasir lineages were reportedly very common so that they became highly interrelated and had to be integrated as a single unit in the newly formed tribe.
We might speculate that the structure of the Abbad tribe would have attained the same genealogical design observed in other Arab tribes had it emerged 200 years earlier. In the early
