A description of mortality and morbidity differentials by race in the context of social and economic inequalities is hard to come by. This is true because the kinds of statistics that might be most useful for this purpose are not usually available. Changes in the character of mortality and morbidity over the last hundred years may have had some important influence regarding why this is so.
A review of mortality trends since 1800, from data for areas such as New York City which have such historical series, is instructive. Such a series displays a pronounced raggedness over the nineteenth century which is replaced by a smoother figure associated with a monotonie reduction in mortality in the twentieth century. In this later period, pronounced variability in mortality rates is less striking across time and more striking in the group differences in risk of death.
As this shift in the pattern of variability has occurred, the frame of reference for examining mortality has required new criteria of social valuation which would permit distinctions as to which differences, or changes in differences, are important and

which are not (Taeuber, 1968, p. 132). The mortality literature has been slow to respond to this need.
Suppose we are concerned with comparing two populations for current mortality experience. If the comparison is made with an eye to a purely demographic concern for survivorship, then deaths may be related to populations at risk and adjusted for differences in age, sex composition, or other selected characteristics thought to obscure the comparison. However, if the mortality experience for comprehensive survivorship is of less interest than the impact of mortality on subject populations in relation to its effect upon the long-run social and economic wellbeing of the population, then the standard procedures are less useful. Trends in the age-adjusted mortality differentials by race are less telling than those which describe changing costs of mortality in the lifeways of the populations; mortality in the economically active components of the population, for instance, may be a more useful target than mortality at ages which account for most deaths. The significance of this proposition is suggested in Figure 1. As is seen in the

one side while on the other the genetic defects and accidents contributing to the losses among the very young as well as the middle-aged now loom large (Moriyama, 1968, p. 577). So there remain fields of battle for medicine.
But more striking now are the differential patterns of morbidity and death -which afflict the population not through medical ignorance but rather through our ignorance of the differences in the way the social order impinges on different human groupings. Medicine and social welfare concerns join hands here in calling for further explication of these differences.
Differential mortality is hardly a new field of study. Many works in the literature for hundreds of years attest to this. However, the progress of understanding differences from a social and economic standpoint appears less well-advanced. And more importantly, the condition of certain population aggregates remains particularly obscure because the study of differentials themselves do not necessarily depict the social and cultural conditions which may accompany the lifeways of specific subpopulations. As examples of subpopulations, one may consider persons in poverty and persons who are black, Mexican-American, or American Indian in the United States.
Evidence to the support of the argument of slow progress in developing social and economic insights is found in the paucity of adequate statistical material for such disadvantaged subpopulations on a national basis. For the Spanish-descent population, as an example, no national data were available until 1969. For all such groups, uncertainty attends the adequacy of data which are available. Both census and vital data are plagued with under-reporting or misreporting of characteristics and events for such groups (Demeny and Gingrich, 1967; Farley, 1968; Kitagawa, 1968). The comparability of data among such groups,

and even within groups across time, is hazardous. Measures of mortality of American Indians have again only recently been subject to question as the 1960 census appears to have generated an unusual affinity of persons to this population when compared with earlier censuses (U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, 1963, p. 1-15). Census undercounts among socalled hard-to-enumerate areas have been of concern to demographers for some years and have recently become notorious as the more militant black population has looked for evidence of racialism in a new and vital perspective.
As we address the problems of disease, disability, and loss of life among those in poverty, another barrier to understanding arises in the absence of a widely agreed upon and analytically adequate definition of poverty. As interest in poverty developed in the early part of the last decade, an economic definition of poverty was conceived which could be rationalized by determining income levels corresponding to costs of a marginal diet and by describing the relationship between food costs and other expenses (Orshansky, 1965). This definition does not, however, deal with the institutional population. More importantly, perhaps, it does not throw light on the relationship between illness and poverty as to the direction of causation. For these reasons, findings which show higher risks of death or higher morbidity rates among the poor are difficult to interpret. Does poverty provide the milieu for reduced life chances, or is poverty a state frequently attained in the short run by the failure of disabled persons, say in the year prior to death, to sustain gainful employment, and thus nonpoverty status (Kitagawa, 1969, P. 14)?
In many respects, the relationship between health and poverty is poorly understood. Although it might be conjectured

372

Sutton

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:32 08 December 2015

that a strong negative relationship exists between the extent of poverty and the extent of health and wellbeing, statistical evidence on this point is not consistently in support of this contention (Lefcowitz, 1970; U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, 1970; U.S. Public Health Service, 1967, 1969a, 1969¿). At the same time, there are specific relationships in which poverty status shows more evidence of morbidity and higher risks of mortality. Certain ethnic and racial groups show similar evidence of ill health which in part is associated with socioeconomic status and attendant health differentials, but which is also in part associated with biological and social conditions which affect the members of these ethnic groups (Fuchs, 196S; Goldstein, 1963; Kadushin, 1964). Studies of poverty and race on other than health matters have shown, for example, relationships with socioeconomic background on the one hand, and discrimination on another, as partly independent antecedents in affecting current status (Duncan, 1969).
MORTALITY AND
DISADVANTAGED STATUS
That differentials exist as to the force of mortality according to social status has long been recognized (Antonovsky, 1967). For much of this time, up until quite recently, these differentials were accepted as inevitable, as inevitable as poverty itself. Although comprehensive studies of occupational differentials date back at least to the turn of this century (U.S. Public Health Service, 1962, p. S2-SS), the apparent focus of concern in such studies has been more often with occupational hazards rather than with those associated with class and status differences.
Unusual difficulties attend the analysis of mortality by socioeconomic status. Since death tends to occur in disproportion

among those who have retired from the labor force and since information provided on death records comes from persons other than the decedent, simple inquiries as to occupation are not thought to yield data of adequate quality for routine presentation and analysis (Lunde and Grove, 1966, p. 569). Obstacles attending occupational coding have led to its elimination in the preparation of machine-readable records, further obstructing the analysis of such data. These and other obstacles which relate to the interpretation of data on occupation in mortality studies have been described by Guralnick (U.S. Public Health Service, 1962, p. 51-52).
Mortality records in the past have not contained information on educational attainment or on family income. These data, particularly data about schooling, are thought to have important advantages regarding problems of interpretation of occupational data. However, recent additions to the standard certificate of death have not included inquiries concerning educational attainment of the decedent (Lunde and Grove, 1966, p. 571).
By far the most significant study in recent years designed to overcome many of these problems has been conducted by Kitagawa and Häuser (1962). This study is based upon a sample of records of deaths in 1960 matched against corresponding 1960 census records, thus bringing a wealth of information concerning population characteristics from persons who were still alive at the time of the census (Kitagawa and Häuser, 1962). It is from this study of some 62,400 decedents whose death records were successfully matched with 25% sample census records (since it is the sample census which contained the needed social and economic characteristics) that much of the following discussion of mortality dealing with race and with social and economic status is based.

KACE AND MORTALITY
We are concerned with the relationship between measures of health and with poverty and associated conditions of disadvantage. Two racial groups--there are more but data are not readily available--clearly exhibit disadvantaged status in the aggregate and can be examined as to their mortality experience. These are the blacks and the American Indians. Moreover, it is also instructive to examine data by color for the United States, since 9 in 10 in the nonwhite population are black and since there is a richer collection of statistics available for white-nonwhite comparison than there is for the comparison of Negro and white. But since some nonwhites fare better as a group than whites--for example, the Japanese and Chinese in view-

ing population distributions by family income--this category does not identify the clearly disadvantaged groups as sharply as do specific racial categories.
Table 1 presents death rates by sex, age, and color for selected decades since the turn of the century. Persistent differentials in survivorship favoring whites are seen to prevail over this period, except at ages 75 and over. Farley's discussion (1970) of trends in mortality and health conditions among blacks in the twentieth century points up two significant phenomena. First, the improvements in life chances and in income in the black population are dramatic in a relatively short period of time, from the decade of the Depression up to 1955. Second, there has been little improvement in mortality since 19551, although a

significant drop in infant mortality is present (Farley, 1970, p. 58-75).
Death rates by race over three decades are presented in Table 2. Although black rates show markedly higher mortality risks than those of the white population, the rates for American Indians are lower.
Age-specific rates and numbers of associated deaths are shown in Table 3. As might be expected, the crude rates are importantly affected by differences in their respective age distributions. Thus, the death rates for American Indians which fall below those of the white population, as well as the only marginally larger death rates among blacks, tend to hide important differences found when age-specific comparisons are made. These statistics are not corrected for errors associated with data collection, either those in death registration or those in census enumeration.

The 1960 death record-census record match study provides age-adjusted data which, for nonwhites standing in for blacks, are modified to reflect, alternatively, census undercounts and age misstatements in death record and census record discrepancies (Kitagawa, 1968). Comparing the uses of the two resultant series of mortality rates, Kitagawa has expressed preference for those which are corrected for underenumeration. Census undercounts, she convincingly argues, are of much greater consequence than apparent age misstatement, at least for ages under, say, 75 (Kitagawa, 1968, p. 8). Given the emphasis here on mortality experiences in the younger and middle age ranges, that choice is of direct utility in the present review.
Age-adjusted mortality among nonwhites exceeds that among whites with corrections for underenumeration (but not age misstatement) by 20% for males and 34% for females.1 Age-specific differentials are large at most ages, but are most pronounced in the 25-64 age range, then sharply falling and reversing after age 75. As Kitagawa notes, the differentials are greatest at the ages in which the force of mortality is lowest, so that the reduced and inverted differentials at the older ages succeed, in net effect, in reducing the impact over all ages (Kitagawa, 1968, Table 3). The consequences of changing the basis of comparison is seen in Table 4.
In the analysis of social and economic factors affecting mortality, mortality experience at the working ages (i.e., at ages associated with low mortality risks) is of considerable importance. Mortality among

In this case, the indexes are directly standardized from age-specific death rates which reflect adjustments for net census undercount by age, but which do not include any adjustment of the death-records data in accordance with noted age discrepancies with corresponding census records.

security to one's ties to the labor force and to gainful employment.
Thus, high mortality rates among the elderly might reduce somewhat the burden of survival upon families in and near conditions of poverty. Central questions within this framework become: (1) What are the chances of survival through the working years of those who attain maturity where concern is with the returns to the black segment of society following the investment in the raising of the child? (2) Viewing the experiences of the newborn and those in subsequent ages prior to the ages of labor force entry, what is the capacity of the population to sustain the effective force of population replacement at the working ages?
The lesser interest in the differentials among the aged is also encouraged by difficulties encountered in interpreting data for Negroes at the older ages. Age misreporting is certainly an important factor but it is not, according to Kitagawa (personal communication), possible to clearly establish whether the reversal in differentials at the very older ages is attributable to problems with the data or whether some other process is at work. On the other hand, Thornton and Nam (1968) have made a case for differential selection of a Darwinist order which accounts for the relatively high survival potential of many nonwhites at the older ages.2
No official life tables exist for the black population. Separate tables have been prepared for whites and nonwhites, however (U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, 1964). Using these tables, another way of looking at differences by color in mortality for the working ages is to compare survivorship values. This was done by determining the relative loss in the life table radix from age 20 to age 65. In the

white population in 1960, 32% of the survivors to age 20 do not survive to age 65, whereas the corresponding figure for nonwhites is 45%.

MORTALITY AMONG BLACKS

Kitagawa (1968) has also reported that blacks had the highest mortality among racial groups for which national data are published--whites, American Indian, Japanese, Chinese, and other races. Her comparisons among races do not reflect corrections for under-enumeration since such calculations are not available by race. The black mortality indexes for population 5 years old and over are 28% higher than whites for males and 47% higher than whites for females (Kitagawa, 1968, p. 13). For American Indians, by contrast, the levels are 24% and 37% above those for white males and females, respectively.
Narrowing to our main interest in those in the age range of 35 to 64 years, Kitagawa provides the following age-adjusted differentials (per cent by which each index exceeds that for whites of the corresponding sex) :

Male Female 66 145" 28 69

INFANT AND CHILDHOOD MORTALITY AND RACE
Race differentials have been presented by Kitagawa (1968) which bear on mortality of the population under 5 years of age and on infant mortality (see Table 5). We know that in the 195O's, a leveling-off in the long-term decline in infant mortality occurred in the United States. That the leveling occurred before infant mortality rates were reduced to the levels found in a number of other countries has caused students of this phenomenon to refuse to consider the then existing levels as approaching an irreducible minimum (Mori-

yama, 1968, p. S73-S7S). Shapiro, Schlesinger, and Nesbitt (1968, p. 10) have also reported that since 19S0, this reduction in the rate of decline of this mortality measure was much more pronounced for nonwhites:
Between 19S3 and 1951 substantial decreases in mortality in the first day of life were scored by the white group; among nonwhite infants the decrease in the rate of loss under 1 day stopped in 1943. More recently --since 1952--the rate of increase in mortality at this age has been greater for the nonwhite than the white infants.
A shift in the timing of loss of life and wastage from the prenatal to the postnatal period is one possible explanation. A contention that these changes might be attributable to problems in the reliability of data for nonwhites is not thought to be warranted because similar patterns have been reported for nonwhites in areas known to have long approached adequate levels of reporting as to completeness and accuracy (Shapiro, Schlesinger, and Nesbitt, 1968, p. 11).
Geographic variations in infant mortality rates permit the generalization that an area with a comparatively low rate among white infants will have a low rate among nonwhite infants; similarly this relationship between color groups holds for rates in the higher ranges. Infant mortality rates among white population have been higher in urban than in rural areas since

the early 1950's. In contrast, nonwhite rates, at least since the late 1940's have been higher in rural areas. But the more notable relationship between color groups in the context of geographic variability "is that infant mortality is far greater everywhere among nonwhite children" (Shapiro, Schlesinger, and Nesbitt, 1968, p. 35).
MORBIDITY AND RACE
Considerable difficulty is encountered in contrasting populations as to morbidity experience given the diversity of diseases, injuries, and other pathological states which afflict man. A simplifying assumption in dealing with morbidity is taken when the focus of the analysis is on the social and economic consequences of such ill health and disability rather than on morbidity itself. Several appropriate measures of the consequences of morbidity have been developed for the population of the United States at the National Center for Health Statistics.
Table 6 presents standardized morbidity ratios for three such measures by color and income for population under age 65 (U.S. Public Health Service, 1967, p. 3 and 8). These ratios relate actual morbidity to that expected when the effects of sex, age, and farm-nonfarm residence are removed. Thus, for acute conditions, the white population in families with less than

ed). A quick perusal of this table provides, convincing evidence that the effect of mortality upon disabled persons has important consequences for data on morbidity since disabilities arising from serious acute and chronic conditions are associated with loss of life which is sufficiently large to affect the quality of reporting of such morbid conditions.3 It has been shown by Sirken (U.S. Public Health Service, 1965) that the loss of morbidity experience from survey data in groups with high mortality risks--the aged, or, here, the disabled Social Security beneficiaries--is substantial.
Data from a 1966 survey of noninstitutionalized disabled adults is in part represented in Table 11 (Brehm, 1970, Table 2). It can be seen that the mortality experience of disabled persons shown in Table 10 roughly corresponds to the cell "disability beneficiaries" of which there were nearly one million in 1966. Although disability definitions will vary (those with major activity limitations aged 17 to 64 in 1968 was just under 10 million [U.S. Public Health Service, 1970, Table 9] ) it is reasonable for us to assume that a much more sizeable population is sub-

ject to mortality risks which are higher than normal for corresponding sex and age classes. Moreover, it should be clear that Disability Insurance beneficiaries are probably--in the context of our concern for black and low-income groups--somewhat better-off than are many disabled persons not covered by disability insurance. Those disabled persons who are receiving public assistance payments--1.268 million in 1966--may well even more severely feel the force of mortality than the OASDHI beneficiaries. Thus, the interrelation of mortality and morbidity brings us to propose that a crucial problem which must be addressed is the integration of these interdependent phenomena.
EFFECTS OF DEATH AND DISABILITY
UPON DEPENDENTS An additional problem in the appraisal of the survival conditions and the wellbeing of the black population in the United States is found in attempting to ascertain the effect of mortality and morbidity upon family organization. The social costs of such experiences, as in the case of direct economic costs, are better appraised in a family context where the realities of the burden of disabled family members as well as the social consequences of the economic loss are found in the death or disability of the breadwinner.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
A review of recent data concerning morbidity and mortality differences between the white and black population is presented to reflect upon the contribution of these data to the relative well-being of the black population. Crude death rates and even age-adjusted mortality rates obscure important mortality differences between blacks and whites. These differences are found particularly at those ages which are of most significance in considering the problem of the social welfare of the population. The black-white differentials are greatest where they have the greatest impact. Morbidity data do not demonstrate such effects; however, it is apparent that mortality and morbidity experiences are closely interdependent and

that an integration of these effects, which has not yet been successfully carried out, would be of considerable utility.
Data currently published which are illustrated here do not lend themselves to simple interpretation of black-white differences related to welfare implications. The size of the mortality differential by race in the working ages is more appropriate to the concerns of the social welfare of blacks as a population in the aggregate than differentials taken more broadly as to general mortality. Even so, once we have established the relative level, the question remains: What is the calculus of wellbeing such that it is possible to sort out significant gains in the analysis of trends in the well-being of blacks in the United States?
