Cattell (1974) makes a case that there might be an underlying dysgenic trend in intelligence. It is surprising that he makes no reference to the extensive work of the late Professor Lionel Penrose. It is also regrettable that his statements concerning Cattell (1950) are at variance with that study. Moreover, the value of 0.83 for heritability which he attributes to Burt and Howard (1956) cannot be found there, and he shows some confusion concerning the concepts of broad and narrow heritability.
Cattell (1974, p. 172) says, "then the fact that the relatively culture-free tests show no change could be interpreted to mean that on some absolutely culture-free test, there has probably been some slight decline in the population fluid intelligence level." The relatively culture-free test is, of course, his own, and the investigations to which no change is attributed are Cattell (1937) and (1950). Concerning the change in IQ in the interval between the two studies, he says (Cattell, 1974,p. 170), "The outcome by my testing was absolutely no change (statistically speaking) over this period of half a generation"

(italics added). He rebukes Dr. Waller in no uncertain terms (p. 169): "As regards the second approach, most writers today assume that the results have shown no drop in intelligence, but indeed, a significant increase. Dr. Waller cites my investigation as agreeing with all the rest in showing such an increase. However, closer scrutiny will show that this is incorrect."
Unfortunately, Cattell is in error. Closer scrutiny reveals that he did find a statistically significant increase. To resolve any doubt, Cattell's (1950, p. 140)Table 1 and his comments concerning the change in IQ are reproduced here.

Discussing Waller's (1971) estimate of heritability, Cattell (1974, p. 173) says, "The most commonly accepted value for heritability of intelligence, namely, 0.80 (in the most exact work of all, that of Burt and Howard [1956], it becomes 0.83), is

confuses estimates of narrow heritability with that of broad heritability. The value of 0.80 with which he compares Waller's value of 0.65 is for broad heritability and is the value often given by Jensen. Cattell (1974, p. 173) gives the formula

(1956) will be disappointed, for they give no such value. Their Table XII on page 126 gives components of variance for intelligence under four assumptions. No combination of genetic components of variance in that table adds to 0.83. Indeed, Burt and Howard (1956, p. 129) state, "With the scores of group tests taken as they stand, we find that as much as 23 per cent is apparently due to unreliability and environment and only about 77 per cent to genetic causes." So far as the reliability of Burt's data is concerned, the reader is referred to Jensen (1974).

which is for narrow heritability. He is therefore comparing Waller's estimate of narrow heritability with Jensen's estimate of broad heritability. Jensen's estimate of narrow heritability for IQ is 0.60; compared with this figure, Waller's (1971) estimate of 0.65 is not too low. There are, of course, theoretical objections to such estimates.
Cattell's (1974, p. 171) suggestion of adding "a third point to the historical plot of IQ mean, providing what may be the longest curve (1935, 1949, 1975) not only
