ABSTRACT: This pilot study explored the association between a measure of water pollution caused by benzene or chlorinated solvents and the incidence of low birth weights for white residents of Michigan counties. A positive relationship between water pollution by these contaminants and the per cent of low-weight births ( < 2,500 grams, or about 5.5 pounds) resulted despite controls for the incidence of teenaged childbearing, infrequent prenatal care, and mean household income from wages or salaries. Water pollution showed an association with the incidence of low birth weight that was as strong as that between low birth weight and low prenatal care. While correlation cannot prove causation, the finding suggests that impure water may impair fetal growth in Michigan.

In lesser developed countries, the quantity of the household's water supply seems to be positively related to infant and young-child survival. For example, data from such disparate places as Brazil, Peninsular Malaysia, and Egypt showed that children had much lower odds of childhood mortality if they came from households with piped water (Casterline et al., 1989; DaVanzo and Habicht, 1986; DaVanzo, 1988; Merrick, 1985; Victora et al., 1986). While the presence of an indoor or outdoor faucet symbolized a higher socioeconomic status, it appeared to convey an ameliorative environmental effect on child mortality beyond that exerted by such other socioeconomic factors as maternal education (in all three countries), paternal education or occupation (in the Brazilian and Egyptian studies), household income (in the Brazilian and Egyptian studies), or access to a toilet (in all three countries). Merrick (1985) speculated that the larger quantities of water available through piping increased the frequency

of washing and reduced the exposure to infectious bacteria.
In more developed countries, the purity of a household's drinking water may be as important as its quantity for children's health, especially in the prenatal period.1 For example, if pregnant women drink polluted water which disturbs fetal growth, then one would expect to see higher rates of spontaneous abortions, congenital malformations, and low birth weights. An industrial accident in San Jose, California, provided a test of this possibility. Organic solvents leaked from a storage tank of a semiconductor firm in 1980-81 and contaminated a well of local drinking water. Because one of the pollutants, trichaloroethane (TCA), was found in concentrations of 8.5 times the stateaction level, the contaminated well was closed in December, 1981.2 Local res-

Water Pollution and Low Birth Weight

A study reported in 1990 by the International Joint Commission (IJC, a U.S.-Canadian committee set up by treaty to oversee the quality of Great Lakes waters bounding the two countries) showed how the pollution of surface water can impair the physical development of human fetuses. For example, chinook and coho salmon caught in Lake Michigan have been found to contain PCB's (halogenated hydrocarbons that degrade slowly). The longer and fatter the salmon caught in Lake Michigan, the heavier their concentration of PCB's (Swinehart, 1990, p. 17). In addition to PCB's, the Great Lakes contain concentrations of such heavy metals as mercury, lead, and cadmium, which are discharged into air and water by industrial factories. Accordingly, the IJC found that women who regularly ate fishcaught in Lake Michigan gave birth to offspring whose gestational lengths, skull sizes, weights at birth, and cognitive, motor, and behavioral skills were far below average.
From these studies, we hypothesized that higher concentrations of contaminants in ground or surface water are related to much higher rates of low birth weights. We tested this notion with data limited to white residents of Michigan counties, as few nonwhites lived in the nonmetropolitan counties comprising the bulk of our study areas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Infants with abnormally low weights at birth are born more often to teenagers, to women who receive insufficient prenatal care, and to women in poverty (Carlson, 1984). Prenatal care is usually deemed insufficient if it starts

after the first trimester of pregnancy and consists of fewer than five visits (Miller, 1985). Thus, a conservative investigation required us to examine the correlation between the incidence, of low birth weight and a measure of water pollution after the detrimental effects of youthful maternal age at birth, insufficient prenatal care, and low socioeconomic status had been removed. Data appropriate for this task were taken from birth certificates registered in 1982 according to the mother's usual Michigan county of residence. Because the Michigan birth certificates recorded not only the weight of the infant at delivery but also the race, the age of its mother at the birth, and the number of her prenatal visits, we could compute the percentages of all white live births which weighed below 2,500 grams (or 5.5 pounds), which occurred to teenagers, and which received the benefits of five or fewer prenatal visits. The 1980 U.S. Census of Population was used to obtain the mean household income in Michigan counties in 1979 from wages and salaries.
Measures of water pollution were ascertained from Site Assessment Scores constructed by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR). These scores were used to evaluate which locations threatened public health and required state funds for clean-ups. The MDNR investigated site histories, containment structures, release potentials, and existing exposure levels. Furthermore, a detailed description of the chemical contaminants was developed to report their types, quantities, associated hazards, exposure characteristics, and concentrations. The routes (ground or surface water, air, fire, land, or explosion)

through which a target population might be exposed to the contaminant were ascertained. Each reported site was then given a numerical score ranging from 0-2000 (in increasing levels of pollution).
The present investigation focused on sites assessed between August 10, 1983, and February 1, 1984, the first time period for which the MDNR computed and reported the Site Assessment Scores. Potentially polluted sites reported to the MDNR after October 14,1983, were not rated in time for this 1983 report (Michigan Department of Natural Resources, 1984). Therefore, the absence of a county from our data list does not imply the lack of befouled water, but rather the failure of people to report potential water pollution by October 14, 1983.
Many different contaminants (e.g., organic compounds, inorganic compounds, or heavy metals) "stored" at a particular site may have polluted both the surrounding water and land. However, a given Site Assessment Score was retained for this analysis only if a ground or surface water route was impure from any of several organic solvents associated with birth defects or cancer (Table 1). If more than one contaminated water site in a county qual-

ified for retention in this analysis, the geometric mean of all such Site Assessment Scores was calculated for that county. Microbiologists prefer the geometric mean over the more familiar arithmetic mean as an average dilution titer (Remington and Schork, 1970, p. 27-28). That these measures of water pollution (the independent variable) postdate the measures of low birth weight (the dependent variable) should not preclude causal inference, since the main source of water pollution in Michigan is air pollution, which has slow and cumulative effects on the state's water resources. Also, since the incidence of low birth weight was virtually the same for white infants in Michigan in 1982 (5.52 per cent) and 1984 (5.48 per cent; National Center for Health Statistics, 1988), it is unlikely that its causes changed appreciably during this time.
RESULTS
In Michigan, 29 counties had known ground or surface water sites polluted with at least one birth-deforming or carcinogenic organic solvent in 1983 (Table 2). Eight of the counties were metropolitan; five, nonmetropolitan adjacent to metro counties; and six-

teen, nonmetro nonadjacent to metro counties. In fact, the county (Clare) with the highest geometric mean water pollution index (992) was a nonmetropolitan county nonadjacent to a metropolitan county. Evidently, water pollution in Michigan was not confined to heavily urbanized counties. In addition, nine of the counties bordered Lake Michigan, one bounded Lake Superior, and two touched Lake Huron (Figure 1). The locations of these 12 counties emphasized the threat that water pollution posed to the purity of the Great Lakes.
In the United States as a whole, 5.59 per cent of white infants in metro counties and 5.66 per cent of white infants in nonmetro counties weighed under 2,500 grams (about 5.5 pounds) at the time of birth in 1982 (Johnson and Zaki, 1988). Thus, the incidence of low-birth-weight deliveries to white women residing in Clare (9.22 per cent), Kalkaska (10.6 per cent), Osceola (7.85 per cent), and Wexford (8.08 per cent) appeared excessive (see Table 2). All four of these nonmetro counties were remote from metro counties and had geometric mean water pollution indices above 700 (i.e., 992, 832, 794, and 742, respectively). Not surprisingly, the water pollution indices were positively correlated with the incidence of low birth weights (r = 0.297, p < 0.06) for the 29 Michigan counties for which we had water pollution scores.
In addition, the percentage of low birth weights among white infants in all 83 Michigan counties in 1982 correlated strongly with the percentage of births occurring to white women who had made five or fewer prenatal visits for medical care (r = 0.300, p < 0.01, N = 83). The incidence of infrequent

prenatal visits varied directly with the incidence of white teenaged childbearing (r = 0.382, p < 0.001, N = 83) and inversely with average household earnings in the county from wages and salaries (r = -0.392, p < 0.001, N = 83). Hence, it was necessary to control the prevalence of insufficient prenatal care, of teenaged childbearing, and of low earnings in the counties, since these factors might confound the relationship between water contamination and the incidence of low birth weights. For this purpose, we regressed the per cent of low birth weights on these control variables, along with the geometric mean score of water contamination (Table 3). We had originally planned to control the effects of metropolitan residence on the incidence of low birth weight; but a strong correlation between metropolitan residence and higher mean household wages (r = 0.803, p < 0.001, N = 83) created multicollinearity in the multiple regression and required us to drop the type of county from further analysis.
The resulting regression model explained 18.08 per cent of the variance in the incidence of low birth weights to the white population of the 29 Michigan counties. The two variables most strongly associated with the incidence of low birth weight were a low incidence of prenatal visits and a high water pollution score. The unstandardized regression coefficient (b = 0.139) showed that a 10-point rise in the percentage of women making fewer than six prenatal visits during pregnancy would result in a 1.39 per cent increment to the percentage of low-birthweight infants. Likewise, a 100-point rise in the geometric mean score of water pollution would be associated

with an increase of 0.03 per cent in low-birth-weight infants {b = 0.003). The magnitudes of the standardized regression coefficients suggested that prenatal care and water pollution (betas = 0.315 and 0.294, respectively) had comparably strong associations with the dependent variable.
The 29 counties in the present study were not randomly sampled from all 83 counties of Michigan. Therefore, tests

of statistical significance do not strictly apply. However, we offer these tests in Table 3 as another way of judging the relative importance of the four predictors of the incidence of low birth weight. This alternative way shows that the relationships between a given predictor and the incidence of low birth weight would occur from chance alone much less often when the predictor is a low incidence of prenatal care (14.5

The similarity in relationships of prenatal care and water pollution to the dependent variable is, once again, striking.
Neither of the predictor variables

most strongly related to the incidence of low birth weight was statistically significant at the 5 per cent level. Perhaps a reason was the small number of cases (TV = 29) in our multiple regression analysis. We follow Kendall's (1973, p. 88) call to avoid conservatively low levels of statistical significance in pilot studies which are meant to identify potentially important relationships. In

view of the adverse public health outcomes of disregarding organic-solvent water pollution when it may affect low birth weight, this relationship should now be explored in more detailed investigations based on large random samples of individual women.
DISCUSSION
Most studies relating water supplies to children's health have examined how piped water reduced the risks of infant or young-child mortality in lesser developed countries. Few studies have asked whether water impurity retards children's physical growth, and even fewer answers to this question have been sought for more developed countries. Toward bridging this gap, the present pilot study explored the association between a measure of water pollution and the incidence of low birth weights to white residents of Michigan counties. The water pollutants of interest were benzene or chlorinated solvents known to be associated with birth defects or cancers.
A positive relationship between the degree of known ground or surface wa-

ter pollution by these contaminants and the incidence of low-weight births ( < 2,500 grams, or about 5.5 pounds) was suggested in our pilot study for Michigan. The relationship (which resulted despite controls for the effects of teenaged childbearing, infrequent prenatal care, and mean household income from wages or salaries) accorded with that from another study where women who regularly ate fish from Lake Michigan (known to be polluted with PCB's) bore children with belowaverage lengths of gestation and weights and skull sizes at birth (International Joint Commission, 1990). In our pilot study, water contamination showed an association with the incidence of low birth weight that was as strong as that between low birth weight and low prenatal care.
The major finding of our study was based on an ecologicalcorrelation between measures computed for aggregates (counties). As such, this correlation could not show whether individual women residents who bore low-weight infants were more likely than the other mothers to drink water from the polluted sites (Robinson, 1950). This lat-

ter relationship should now be explored in more detailed investigations based on large random samples of individual women. These newstudies should be prospective rather than retrospective so as to record accurately the source(s) ofdrinking water (tapped or bottled and ground or surface) during the pregnancy and to analyze the composition ofthe water atthepoint of consumption rather than at the point of supply. Also, these investigations should take into account the usage during the pregnancy of alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, and other drugs known or suspected to affect fetal growth. Such work can reveal whether the inverse association between socioeconomic status and adverse pregnancy outcomes shown so consistently inpast re-

search partly reflects different lifestyles of risk based onthe knowing or unwitting ingestion of chemicals.
