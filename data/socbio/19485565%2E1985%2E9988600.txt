ABSTRACT: Surname, analysis, a technique to estimate genetic relatedness, is applied here to differences within and between eight militia companies (N=782) mustered for New York Colony in 1760. Universal service laws of the time imply that militias are unbiased community samples. Colonial American populations are of interest due to their heterogeneous migrant origins, balanced by effects of large kin groups. The surname of each militiaman was checked for identity to that of all others within and between the eight companies. Assuming surnames derive from common ancestry, fractions of name identity index relatedness. Within-company relatedness is high, below only that found in genetic isolates, probably due to enlistments together of kinsmen. Between-company relatedness is the lowest yet recorded, apparently because of the diverse origins of these populations.
One of the objectives of biological hereditary surnames for some length of anthropology is to determine the origins time. The method can also be applied to of the differences found within our spe- historical populations (cf. Sedlund, cies. Considerable research has been 1971; Souden and Laster, 1978; Küchedone on small relatively isolated groups, mann et al., 1979; Swedlund and Boyce, but studies of national populations are 1983). much more difficult.

could best be described by a half matrix comparing every individual with every other. Since surnames apply only to male lines of descent, coefficients of relationship among surnames only sample a tiny fraction of lines of descent even within a modest period of time (less than one in a billion in thirty generations), so the method can only lead to statistical statements about populations. To reach these statements we can compare the surname of every individual with that of every other and score the fraction that are identical as in Figure 1.
Of the 36 squares, 4 mark identity of surnames and (if they received these

surnames from a common ancestor) the genetic relationship of the men of one company to those of the other would be estimated as half of 4/36 by the logic established by Crow (1980). In this example the first five names are drawn from Captain Clinton's Company raised in Ulster County, N.Y. and the remaining four names are from Captain Mor's Company raised in the County of Queens. Thus, the relationship can be partitioned: 3 of 10 squares, hence a relationship coefficient of V2 x 3/10 = 0.15, within the Ulster County Company, zero in 6 = 0 in the small sample from Queens, and V2 x V20 = 0.025 be-

tween the two groups. In this way we have calculated the commonality of surnames among all the men and officers in eight companies of New York Militia.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows within-company relationships compared with that between companies. How do we interpret these results? First of all, the within-company relationship is high. Only genetic isolates studied yield higher levels of relationship (cf. Crow and Mange, 1965). The high value within companies of the colonial militia may result from brothers and other close kin joining up together.
New York law required that all men enlist themselves in a local militia company (Vollmer 1947), so we consider these records to be unbiased samples of local male populations. Since names were recorded on the militia rolls in no obvious order, we are assuming that the mustering officer simply had the men line up and enrolled them as they appeared. A common pattern is the sequential listing of four of five German-

born men, a group of Irish together, and so on -- precisely how you would expect a group of men to sort themselves in a line. More to the point, men of identical surname often appear serially on the roll of a specific company. This implies relatedness; but we must make both conservative and liberal estimates of this relatedness since we have been unable tofind further corroborative evidence. Our most limited assumption (which minimizes the estimate of close kin) includes only a few pairs where there is at least a twenty-year age difference between the two, and the son is identified ("Issack Betherton, Issack Betherton, Jr."). Of the 782 men in the eight companies there are only four pairs which fit this criterion among 610,742 possible pairs of men. We believe that this figure underestimates the number of close kin.
A more realistic assessment is arrived at in the following way. Within companies, those men of the same surname who appear serially and who are close in age may be assumed, for this argument, to be brothers. There were 34 such men in 17pairs, plus 6 additional men in two tri-

pie sets (which produce an additional 6 "brother" pairs). Overall, then, there are 40 "brothers" in 23 pairs. To these and the 4 father-son pairs mentioned above one can add 3 other "father-son" pairs where there are 2 men of the same surname appearing together on the roll, but with age differences of at least 20 years. Thus, there were 27 pairs of first degree relationship among 610,742 possible pairings. Sincefirstdegree kin have a coefficient of relationship of 0.5, the average coefficient from these pairs is 22.1 x 10"6.
As a much broader index of relatedness, we simply counted all of the pairs who shared the same surname by the method shown in Figure 1. From these we calculated the coefficients of relationship shown in Table 1. Assuming that kinsmen on the mother's, mother's mother's and father's mother's side etc. are as likely to have enlisted together as those on the father's side, each pair with the same surname represents as much kinship in the population as a pair of brothers and the average relationship risesto 1218 x 10~6within company and 345 x 10"6 between companies as shown in Table 1. Thus, the surname analysis suggests more than an order of magnitude relationship among these men--even between different companies--than that deduced from trying to identify fathers, sons, and brothers.

eenth and nineteenth centuries. The low values between companies are obviously caused by the heterogeneous origins of the recruits rather than by isolation of the regions where the militia units were recruited. Only 31.1 per cent were born in the colony of New York, an additional 28.7 per cent were born in other colonies, 4.4 per cent in England and Wales, 19.6 per cent in Ireland, 1.7 per cent in Scotland, 12.8 per cent in Germany, and the remaining 1.7 per cent in France, Holland, Italy, and the West Indies. Since there is essentially no commonality of surnames between these European countries (and very little intermarriage in the period since hereditary surnames were established), this offsets the inclusion of relatives in the military units and gives a modest overall level of relationship of 0.00046-- the same as Raspe and Lasker (1980) reported between the Scilly Isles and mainland England and Wales and approximately the same as found in the cities of Reading and Kidlington in England today (Lasker, 1978b; Lasker et al., 1979). The levels of relationship between companies of the colonial militia of New York in 1760 are thus among the lowest reported anywhere and reflect the very diverse origin of the colonists.

CONCLUSION
Relationship by isonymy between companies is the lowest yet recorded. Oxfordshire (Küchemann et al., 1979) and Kent (Souden and Lasker, 1978) villages had higher values in the eight-
