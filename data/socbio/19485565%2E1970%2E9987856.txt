1 The survey was conducted by the Demographic Research Centre, Economics Dept., Lucknow University. Itwas based on a sample of 4,420 households out ofthe ration-card list ofhouseholds in the city of Lucknow, capital of Uttar Pradesh, one of the largest states in India. The technique of simple random sampling with replacement was adopted. Two independent subsamples, Aand B, were drawn to verify theresults. Due to thesmall number of births in each category of socioeconomic variable, the fertility analysis is based on the total sample. In this case other statistical tests are applied for testing the conclusions.

tudes toward family planning maybe affected by the differences in the age offemales with less or more education or by differences in their background, i.e., urban or rural. To eliminate these effects, the best method would be to apply cohort analysis. However, thedata of our survey are not amenable to such treatment since the investigation wasnot directed toward the relationship between fertility of mothers and their education or their rural/urban background, but rather toward the relationship of the educational and residential

background of a family to age at marriage, fertility, and attitudes. Our findings are in no way vitiated by the lack of data for cohort analysis, since our results indicate that the average age of females in families of different educational background is more or less the same, and any differences are in favor of a higher average age of females in more educated households than in others, as shown in Table 1.

in the background of the parents. For instance, it was observed in the United States that differentials in fertility in respect to education in urban couples are generally accounted for by those urban couples in which at least one spouse has a farm background in the sense that the spouse's father was a farmer when the spouse was 16 years old.
We wish such specific data were available

* Those who cannot read or write are treated as "Illiterate," while those who can do

It is obvious from the above data that females in households of all educational groups are almost equally young or old. Hence, any observed differentials in fertility with respect to education cannot be due to the more educated households being younger and the less educated households being older, and the different groups having different years of child bearing.
Differential fertility with respect to education even after the elimination of agefactor may still be due in part to differences

for our inquiry; but all that we have is the rural-urban background of households as determined by the ordinary residence of a head of household in a rural or urban area during the last ten years. This criterion was selected for purposes of measuring the extent of assimilation and adoption of urban values and way of life which may be significant in fertility behavior.
The data reveal that a little more than 94% of the sample households were urban, and less than 6% had a rural background.

This is certainly startling since the heavy rural-urban migration in the country would lead one to expect that there would be a substantial proportion of rural-background families. Therefore, this phenomenon needs an explanation. It lies partly in the fact that the pattern of migration to the large cities is usually from a village to a small town and thence to a larger town. Our city being the capital of the largest state in the country has mostly migrants from other towns rather than from villages. Hence, there are not many people, even among migrants, who themselves or whose parents have been farmers or cultivators. Moreover, as has recently been reported by the Nation-

male and female mean age at marriage and the educational status of the head. The finding is supported by the data of the two subsamples as well as that of the total sample (see Table 2). In spite of a small dispersion of two to three years in mean age at marriage, there is a consistent increase in age with a rise in educational status. The female mean age at marriage increases from a little less than 16 years in households with illiterate heads of households to more than 18 years with higher education of heads. Mean age at marriage of males is higher by some four to five years than that of females and increases from 20 years in households with illiterate heads to 23 years in those

al Commission of Labour, even the working class people have been staying in towns and the worker is now usually a townsman. In view of this, we may assume that the rural/ urban or agricultural/non-agricultural background differences among the more and less educated of the urban households are only marginal.
Fertility level as judged by crude birth rate and infants per thousands of females in the reproductive age group (general fertility rate) stood at 34.6 and 170 respectively in the year of inquiry (1966-67). It was lower than the corresponding estimates for the state as a whole, which were 39.8 and 191.
MEAN AGE AT MARRIAGE
A very significant finding of the survey is the clear positive relationship between

where the heads are educated up to the Secondary and Higher level. A rise in educational status of heads from Illiteracy to Literacy (Below Primary) makes very little difference in the mean age at marriage of females; but beyond this level there are larger gains in mean age at marriage. For households which have heads educated up to Primary or Below Primary levels it remains around 21 years.
A direct relationship is also observed in mean ages at marriage of both sexes and the highest educational attainments of adult males in the households (Table 3). In both the subsamples as well as in the total sample, the mean age at marriage of males increases gradually with the level of education and the dispersion is of about three years. The female mean age at marriage in households where all the males are illiterate is about 16

GENERAL FERTILITY
The educational status of the head is also significant in determining the level of fertility in the households. The highest fertility of 243.6 isrecorded forthe households where the head is completely illiterate and declines consistently with a rise in his educational status, with theexception that it is a little

graduation or post-graduation. The male mean age at marriage also varies from about 20 years to 23 years with corresponding variations in female education. Theremay be a co-variation between the educational attainment ofheads and its female members, and therefore the extent of differences in mean ageat marriage by their educational status does not differ. But a positive relationship between themean ageat marriage of males and females and the educational attainment of heads andits members gives support to thehypothesis that the cultural

higher for heads having higher education than for those where it is confined up to secondary level. Theeducational standards of adult males seem to have thesame influence on fertility as that of head of the household. There is again a clear negative relationship between the highest educational standard of adult males in the household and its fertility.
General fertility also varies indirectly with female education. Starting with a general fertility rate of 164 in households where all the females are illiterate, it falls

gradually in households with Primary or Secondary level of maximum education and reaches a minimum of 68 with highest attainment by females up to the Higher level. The level of fertility is comparatively lower in all categories when households are classified by female education. At the low levels of education, it indicates larger influences of

children a young couple should have under the present conditions. A direct relationship was observed between the educational achievement of the heads of the households and the size of family which they preferred (Table 6). The preference for only one child was not very high in general, but a higher proportion of educated heads of household chose this number than those with primary or lower levels of education, including the illiterates. Less than 8% of the illiterate heads preferred two children, while 24% of the highly educated heads chose this number. Similarly, preference for three children also successively increased with the levels of education. In general, there was a higher preference for three children than for two, but the difference was more marked among households with secondary education than in other categories. The preference for four children was smaller than for two or three, and there were no

head of household and its male members than that of the females. It may also be due to the existence of educated members in the family where the females might be completely uneducated. On the other hand, an extremely low fertility associated with secondary and higher education of females testifies to the cumulative impact of all educational development of the households on fertility behavior (Table 5).
OPINION ON SIZE OF FAMILY
The heads of the households were asked to express their opinions on the number of

marked differences among households with different levels of education with regard to preference for five, six, or more children. The proportion of responses for four children follows a bell-shaped curve, as it was lowest among illiterate heads and increased with below-primary and primary education. After reaching the peak at primary level, it again fell with higher levels of education.
A most significant feature is the indefinite response given by an overwhelming majority of illiterate and meagerly educated heads of households, in spite of the recent intensive family-planning program in the city. The

proportion of such responses, however, declined with a rise in educational status. I t is the uneducated high-fertility group which has the largest fluidity of opinion on such matters.
The variation in the opinion of the head on the desired number of children by the highest educational standard of the adult males in the household was almost the same as by the education of its head; but the proportion of indefinite responses was much

of the heads of the households preferred only one child where the females were highly educated. Another 42% of the households in this category considered two to be the proper number, and more than 38% gave preference for three. Only 8.5% of the heads in households with highly educated females gave preference for four children. A negligible proportion of heads in such households was in favor of five children, while no one responded for six or more.

higher in households where all the adult males were illiterate than in those where only the head was uneducated and it decreased with an increase in level of education (Table 7).
The influence of education on the number of children considered to be ideal is further supported by the variation in the opinion of heads by the highest educational standard of adult females (Table 8). The preference for two or three children increased with a rise in highest educational attainments of females in the household. As many as 4.3%

Preference for two children increased very sharply with the level of education of adult females in the households. In general, there was a larger preference for three children than for two except in households with higher attainment of education by the females.

education. The proportion of indefinite responses also continued falling with a rise in the highest level of education attained by a female in a household.
OPINION ON LIBERALIZATION Oí" ABORTION
A wide divergence in the opinion of the head of the household on the problem of liberalization of abortion laws was observed by the educational status of the households. Only about 3 % of the illiterate heads of the households were in favor of liberalization, while this proportion increased to 4 3 % among those with higher education. There was a sudden increase in the proportion of

tional status of adult males in the households; but the ratio of opinions in favor to those against was not so favorable. On the other hand, opinions in favor of liberalization of abortion were generally more numerous among households where the females were also educated up to a certain level than among uneducated households (Table 9). It increased consistently with a rise ineducational achievement of the females in the households. However, there was no marked divergence in the proportion of opinion in favor of liberalization between households with secondary and higher levels of education of females. A very small proportion of the heads of households failed to express

households favoring liberalization, from about 6% to 11% with primary or belowprimary education to 28% among those educated up to secondary level, and then to 43% among those with still higher education. The proportion of the heads of the households with no opinion on the problem declined with an increase in educational status. Opinions definitely opposed to abortion laws being liberalized were ten times more numerous than those favoring it among the illiterate heads of households. However, this ratio declined with the level of education, and opinions in favor and against were equally divided among heads who were highly educated. The position was more or less the same when the opinions of the heads were classified by the educa-

their opinion where the females were highly educated as compared to those with lower levels of education. The educational level of thefemales seems to influence the opinion of the heads of the households partly because of the correlation between education of females and heads of household and partly because of a modernization of outlook associated with female education.
SUMMARY
The above analysis made on the basis of a household survey in an urban area indicates (1) a positive relationship between the educational attainments of household members including its head and the mean ages at marriage of males and females; (2)

Vol. 17, No. 2

a strong negative relationship between fertility and educational status of the households; (3) a direct relationship of preference for two or three children with the educational level of the head and household members; and (4) an increase in the

proportion of opinion in favor of liberalization of abortion laws with a rise in educational achievement. These findings indicate the important role cultural factors, such as education, play in molding the reproductive behavior of a household.
