American white skulls of corresponding sex and age (Post, 1969). Male skulls had slightly larger ducts than female skulls; older skulls (over age SO) had very slightly larger canals than those of younger adults. Variances corresponded with means, being notably greater for American colored than for white, slightly greater for males than for females, and very slightly greater for skulls of older individuals. The canals of the American colored samples were also shorter in length and straighter in course than those of whites. These results confirm several earlier reports, none of which included metric data. (Martin, 1928, Vol. I, p. 270).
Since the excess in size of the American colored contrasted with the white tear ducts was considerable, it seemed worthwhile to investigate samples from additional populations, and to seek possible explanations of

Medical records available include sex, age at death, race, and in many cases additional information. Skulls were divided arbitrarily into two age groups: "Young" adults, 15 to 49; and "Old," over 50. American colored female skulls were too few to warrant reporting.

Measurement of the size of the superior
opening of the lacrimal duct in the orbit was
made by comparison with a series of holes in
a small metal sheet, standardized for
measuring the sizes of knitting needles. This
method is more accurate and more rapid
than measurement by sliding caliper. Classi-
fication categories are in terms of square
millimeters of cross-sectional area of each
canal opening, rather than diameter, as
follows:

Size Number
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9
10 11 12

Diameter (mm.)
3.2 3.5 3.8 4.1 4.5 4.9 5.3 5.8 6.3 7.0 8.0 9.0

28.09 33.64 39.69 49.00 64.00 81.00

Duct openings which depart from circular shape present obvious difficulties, but they can be measured far more accurately by this method than by sliding caliper. The shapes of ducts were classified arbitrarily as round or not round. Most of the latter are oval; some, elliptical.

RESULTS
Complete data are presented in Table 1, in categories ranging from Size 1 through Size 12. Sex and side (left and right) are distinguished, each with its sample size (N.O.). The number of skulls of each sample is also noted (N.S.). Discrepancies between these figures are due to ducts which are unilaterally missing or badly damaged. Determinations of sex are based on museum records when available; otherwise on the author's estimate, which proved 79% accurate in a test of skulls with medical records. No measurements of length of tear duct are reported since these have not proven accurate (Post, 1969).
The principal conclusion of the previous paper (Post, 1969) is clearly substantiated by comparisons between pooled samples of African Negroes with Caucasians. The smaller means and higher variabilities of Caucasian tear duct sizes are significant at probability levels well below one tenth of one per cent for left and right sides of both sexes. Data for left and right sides are considered separately since statistical correction for their intercorrelation would be

laborious; sexes are considered separately to avoid correction, which would alsobe laborious.
Since small size has an important functional significance, due to greater risk of infection, as discussed below, populations are compared in the numbers or frequencies of ducts which fall below a particular size category. The significance of population differences is then estimated by chisquare tests. For example, to compare the numbers of African and Caucasian males of left tear duct Size 7and smaller, we make a two-by-two table from data inTable 1, pooling the four samples ofAmerican and European whites and three samples of West Coast Africans (see Table 2).

Comparison between African Negroes and pooled Caucasians of either sex at any threshold ofsize leads to the same conclusion.
To facilitate survey of the data presented in Table 1, some of the samples have been arbitrarily pooled and summarized in Table 3, combining lefts with rights. Here the Caucasians are clearly differentiated from all other populations, in both sexes,by excessive numbers of ducts of smaller size. As rough criteria, one may scan the modes, which are italicized, orcompare the numbers in and below any specific size. Caucasians have the largest frequencies of small ducts at any threshold.
Several minor population differences are

suggested, but none is of statistical significance. The American colored are intermediary between Caucasians and nonCaucasians, closely approaching the former in the large sample of males but departing further from them in the smaller sample of females. Some of the other samples have higher frequencies of small ducts, depending on how the comparisons are appraised. At the other end of the range the Eskimo and Aleuts have slightly larger ducts, as shown by any manner of appraisal, but they are

Only four non-Caucasian samples approach them in their monopoly of small-sized ducts: one sample of 23 Australian aborigine males (in the American Museum of Natural History); 23 Chinese females; and the Hawaiian males and females.
The Caucasians' excess of small ducts is evident at any threshold. Thus for "Size 4

not differentiated sufficiently to demonstrate statistical significance.
The modes of the samples in Table 3 are ranked by size, from larger to smaller, in Table 4.
The other basis for ranking, on the principle of specific size thresholds (ignoring instances of a few cases of "stragglers"), gives fairly similar results as shown in Table 5.

Corresponding frequencies for "Size 5 and Smaller" are 22.0% and 27.2% for male and female Caucasians, 2.1% and 4.5% respectively for non-Caucasians.
Ducts vary morphologically in many features, none of which can be measured or even described with precision. One obvious

feature is the shape of the superior opening, which may be classified most simply as "round" or "not round." No significant difference in the frequencies of these forms is found between the sexes or populations. Some of the samples of Caucasians have very slightly lower frequencies of round openings, while African Negroes, PapuanMelanesians, Peruvian Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts have slightly higher frequencies of round openings than usual.

Eskimo and Aleuts are further distinguished by the thinness of their lacrimal bones; Africans and Melanesians, by the small size of their lacrimals (Martin, 1928).
All of the non-Caucasian skulls except those of the Terry and Howard University collections were collected before the turn of

ences are too small to distinguish these population samples statistically. On the other hand, curiously enough, discordance or difference in the shape of the duct between the left and right sides is notably greater in Caucasian samples than in others, and notably less frequent in Eskimo and Aleut samples, as discussed below.
A second morphological feature of importance is the development of the lacrimal crest. Both the anterior and the posterior crests are more frequently larger in all dimensions, and more uniform, among Aleuts and Eskimos. This is particularly true of the

the century and are considered to be virtually unmixed (without Caucasian ancestry).
ASYMMETRY
Since populations are known to vary in the frequencies of certain morphological asymmetries of the cranium, face, and long bones (Post, 1936), counts were made of discordances or left-right differences in paired observations of both the size and the shape of tear duct openings. Complete results are presented in Tables 6 and 7, respectively.^Sample sizes are smaller than in

is highly significant statistically (Table 8). The female distributions do not always parallel the males; nor do females reflect the dichotomy when the samples of each group are pooled (Table 8). The two highest frequencies areamong Pueblo Indians (65%) and Hawaiians (60%). Other high frequencies (54% to 57%) include the American whites of theTerry Collection, Egyptians, Chinese, and Papuan-Melanesians. Theremaining samples (48% and below) include three "primitive" populations--Australians (37%), West Africans (48%), and Eskimo (46%); also, thePeruvian Indians (32%), mixed modern Europeans (42%), and Neolithic Europeans (37%). Theinclusion of prehistoric Caucasian skulls within the range of "primitives" is noteworthy.

High variability of thetear duct in size is evident from the data here reported, even without estimating the variances. Among "primitives," in the first eight samples of Table 3, most of the male skulls fall into five categories of size, from Size 6, through Size 10, inclusive. The diameters of the two extreme classes are, respectively, 4.9 and 7 mm. Since the function of a duct is represented more realistically byits area of cross-section, these figures may be squared, becoming respectively 24 and 49 square millimeters, one double the other. Corresponding figures for male Caucasian duct sizes are 16.8 and 49, almost triple one another. Few anthropometric measurements

reveal as great variation. Non-metric variation is even greater, much of it obviously maladaptive.
The question of association between tear duct size and face length has arisen (Post, 1969). Although no measurement was made of face length in this study, the possibility of such association may be discounted by the fact that Peruvian Indians and Pueblo Indians typically have short faces (Martin, 1928), yet the tear ducts of these samples are large.
It might be questioned whether duct size is a function of orbit size. The suggestion arises from the parallel between the larger overall skull size of males and the larger duct sizes among males in most of the samples (even though the reverse is found among the Australian aborigines, and no sex difference is evidenced among the Papuan-Melanesians). Since sex differences in orbit size are negligible (Martin, 1928), this association may also be discounted.
The height and breadth of orbits of the Central European skulls were measured with sliding calipers. Scattergrams of duct size with each of these measurements indicate completely random distribution. A third scattergram, between duct size and the product of orbital height times orbital breadth, also shows no association.
Explanation of the excess of smallersized ducts among Caucasians has been sought in every conceivable direction. No suggestion of ecological adaptation is evident, considering each of the various niches of climate represented by the samples under review--arctic, temperate, subtropical desert, tropical desert, and tropical humid. No sample is clearly distinguishable one from another except the Caucasian, and to a lesser degree the American colored, which may be attributed to their fraction of Caucasian ancestry. Resemblance between the climate of the homelands of Caucasians and those of some of the samples with low fre-

supplementing the less concentrated secretions of the nasal mucosa.
Anatomical obstructions in the lacrimal canal ofadults usually produce infection and symptoms (called dacryocystitis, inflammation of the lacrimal excretory system) as well as epiphora. Congenital cases are surprisingly common, but rarely serious, almost always correcting themselves spontaneously before theonset of tears at three to four weeks. Most congenital cases are attributed to delayed rupture of delicate membranes within the canal, which normally disappear very soon after birth, or to imperfect openings of the inflow papillae. Childhood and adolescent cases are infrequent, most of the serious cases arising at ages over thirty. There is no sex difference in frequency prior tothe menopause, follow-

of anatomists and surgeons, notably by Schaeffer (1912a, p. 20-21; 19124; 1920, p. 256-257) and Garfin (1942, p. 169). The inferior ostium varies even more than the superior inboth size and shape, particularly in position. The inferior ostium rarely assumes a simple shape, such as round or oval; it may be lunate, pentagonal, slit-like, hourglass-shaped, or even double. Cases ofbifurcated canals with double openings are not rare, and some triple openings have been reported. In one case the ostium was located above rather than beLw the concha. Dissections ofthe canal course have revealed even greater variation, irregular constrictions and broadenings being therule rather than the exception, together with all types of unevenness, including bulges or diverticula, usually of exotic shapes. The largest

appendices often terminate in an aborted ostium. Embryological studies reveal unusual variation at the earliest stages of development (Schaeffer, 1920, p. 237-258; Schwarz, 1934), which points to genetic control. None of this variation can be considered functional. It reflects a very low level of adaptability, and may be aptly described as "evolutionary nonsense." Unfortunately, all published studies of such variation are of whites.
RELAXED SELECTION
Only one hypothesis can be offered to explain the near monopoly of small tear ducts by Caucasians: diminished efficacy of natural selection in eliminating genetic variants of small size, concomitant with changes in the culture-habitat of Caucasians many generations ago, which has permitted the accumulation of genes contributing to small size. Support for the theory may be at present spotty, but it merits consideration.
Dacryocystitis has been reported as extremely rare among Negroes, contrasted with Caucasians, in two biracial eye clinic samples (Santos-Fernandez, 1921; Garfin, 1942). Medical literature has been searched in vain for further references to population frequencies of this disease. Foster states that it is "agreed" that Negroes suffer "scarcely at all" (1956, p. 143). Several ophthalmologists with large multiracial practices have stated privately to the author that dacryocystitis is almost unknown outside of whites, yet among almost all their cases the environmental and occupational positions of the nonwhites expose them more frequently to infection.
Association between dacryocystitis and smaller lumen of the bony canal has not been thoroughly investigated, in contrast with the large literature on duct stenosis of mucosal tissue. While it seems reasonable to assume that smaller ducts would occasion greater risks of infection, and while no

ophthalmologist has challenged this assumption among some dozen whose opinion the writer has sought, no published data have been found on the subject. The absumption is substantiated by the higher frequencies of infection among females, whose canals run to smaller sizes than males'. Higher frequencies of dacryocystitis among females than males has been reported even among selected patients suffering from mucosal duct obstruction (Dalgleish, 1967, p. 465).
The genetic basis of small-size bony ducts has not been investigated, and this is indeed a great weakness of the relaxation hypothesis. Family histories of dacryocystitis have been reported widely (Traquair, 1941; Sorsby, 1951, p. 196, 1953, p. 367; Viers, 1955, p. 73; Foster, 1956; Waardenburg, 1961, Part 6, Chap. 4, p. 295-297; and others). However, since members of a family share their environment as well as their heredity, such studies cannot yet be considered proof of genetic control.
Since the size of the bony canal is difficult to determine in the living, we cannot be optimistic about the prospects for making family history investigations of undersized ducts, and must be satisfied with population studies. These are at least suggestive of relaxed selection. The excess of small ducts among Caucasian skulls compared with those of all other populations--roughly 3 per cent, from scanning Table 3--is not far from the frequency of dacryocystitis among Caucasian eye patients.
I t is interesting to note the close resemblance in the distribution of duct sizes between Neolithic and modern European skulls in both sexes. This suggests that relaxation in the vigor of natural selection against small size may have taken place a very long time ago, since the present samples of Neolithic skulls are only 3,500 to 5,000 years old, and undoubtedly had many generations of post-Paleolithic culture-habitat

behind them. From our knowledge of contemporary "primitive" or Paleolithic culture-habitats it seems reasonable to assume that particular stress is imposed by infection and disease. In contrast, even the simplest of Neolithic people had definite advantages: a more stable supply of food and better storage of food, permitting the sick to be less rigorously driven to seeking food; shelter from storms and excesses of climate; larger groups of people, permitting more cooperation. Selection pressures must have been substantially reduced during early Neolithic times, and presumably have been cumulatively reduced ever since.
Finally, the high variability in form and size of tear ducts and the high frequencies of obviously malformed tear ducts among Caucasians point strongly to relaxed selection. I t is unfortunate that similar studies

have not been made as yet on other populations.
