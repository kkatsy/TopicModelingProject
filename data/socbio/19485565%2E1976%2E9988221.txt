ABSTRACT: The relationship between inbreeding as measured by isonymy and by pedigrees was investigated in Kippel, a village in southern Switzerland. Inbreeding estimated by isonymy was 3.5 times the estimate obtained from pedigree analysis. Our results indicate a higher prevalence of lines traced through males owing to social causes. This limited pool of potential mates has a high frequency of shared surnames which produces the overestimate of inbreeding by isonymy.

It seems likely that studies of inbreeding using isonymy (surname concordance) will proliferate because of the simplicity of the approach and the possibility of probing for remote ancestry. However, Crow and Mange (196S) and Hussels (1969) compared inbreeding estimates based on pedigree analysis and on isonymy among the Hutterites and among the residents of Saas, a Swiss Alpine valley, and found that in both cases isonymy revealed a higher percentage of inbreeding than did pedigrees. Therefore, it is of some importance that further research in similar population groups be conducted to replicate this type of study in a variety of cultural settings to establish or disprove that the isonymy method produces higher inbreeding estimates than does pedigree analysis.
We therefore present data for Kippel, Switzerland, an Alpine isolate with a living population of 450 studied by Friedl in 1969-70 and 1972.* In addition, we present further results of an inbreeding analy-

sis reported elsewhere (Friedl and Ellis, 1974).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Genealogical information was gathered from church and civil records for 136 sibships representing the pedigrees of all 450 living native residents of the village in 1970. Including living villagers, pedigree depth allows calculation of inbreeding through third cousins. Eventually, five adoption and illegitimacy cases were discarded due to inability to trace either a matrilineage or a patrilineage, leaving 131 cases for analysis. Data were coded and punched on IBM cards for input into a revised version of the computer program published by MacCluer et al. (1967). Output includes breeding coefficients by generation, using the method of Kudo (1962).
Isonymy rates and inbreeding from isonymy were calculated. This process involved tabulating surname concordance in the 131 married parents of the sibships for observed isonymy. Expected or random isonymy was also calculated.2 The fre-

RESULTS
In 131 sibships representing the living native population of Kippel as of 1970, pedigree analysis shows that the mean inbreeding coefficient after nine generations of inbreeding was 0.0090. This figure almost doubles our previous estimate based on church dispensations (Friedl and Ellis, 1974, p. 706). Parents had the same surname in 16/131 or 12.2 per cent of these sibships (/). Combining sexes and letting qt be the frequency of the ith surname in these sibships, random isonymy is estimated as

Roberts and Rawling (1974). In summary, isonymy and inbreeding are related based upon the constant relationship between the probability of affinal relatives having the same surname (P) and the inbreeding coefficient of their possible offspring (F), such that PIF is always equal to 4. In the case of sibs, the probability of having the same surname is 1 and the inbreeding coefficient is one-fourth so that PIF equals 4. In first-cousin marriages made at random, since there are four types, one out of four couples will have identical surnames. Therefore, the probability of isonymy is

the population. In general, we may writek = $/C (Morton and Hussels, 1970, p. 68), where k is concordance of names due to kinship and where C equals 4 on the null hypothesis of random sex labeling (i.e., that marriages of brothers' children make up one-fourth of first-cousin matings).
In order to test this null hypothesis, Hussels (1969) regressed isonymy as a binary variable (0, 1) on the coefficient of inbreeding estimated from pedigrees. C was equal to 4.58 ± 0.72, in good agreement with the expected value of 4. In Kippel, we found C equaled 6.77 ± 1.72, and this value is not significantly different from the value of 4 expected on the basis of random distribution of the types of cousin marriage.
We further tested whether patrilineal chains of relationship were preferred in consanguineous marriages, a possibility suggested to us by Morton (personal communication, 1974). We found such a preference (Friedl and Ellis, 1974, Table 3). However, the number of cases was too small to produce an unequivocal finding. But if this is so, it means either that patrilineal chains of relationship are more prevalent than expected or, alternatively, that matrilineal chains are harder to trace. Two social explanations for this result are partible inheritance and patrilocality.
Since relationship among members of the same surname group (Stamm)is recognized, these results also seem to contradict the villagers' awareness of possible congenital diseases being transmitted and compounded through marriage of close relatives (Friedl, 1974, p. 27). However, this awareness is relatively recent in its effects upon the choice of marriage partners.
Consanguineous marriage is not a preferred type of marriage in Kippel, and first-cousin marriages are uncommon. Therefore, the closed nature of the Kippel gene pool may have imposed a certain

level of inbreeding on the population. A similar phenomenon has been reported for the Amish (McKusick et al., 1964), on Tristan de Cunha (Roberts, 1967), and in Isle-aux-Coudres (Philippe and Gomila, 1972). To test for this phenomenon in Kippel, we grouped married pairs by generation and calculated the proportion of observed isonymous marriages and the frequency of expected matches according to the method of Yasuda and Furusho (1971). Figure 1demonstrates that random

inbreeding gradually builds through time and most of the variation in total inbreeding is due to nonrandom inbreeding.
The apparent preference for isonymous mates within consanguinity groups is therefore most probably due to a limited number of different-surname potential mates among the local residents. This limitation is a result of the Alpine setting of the village, which severely limited in- or out-migration.
The isonymy approach assumes that spouses are chosen without regard to surnames. However, as pointed out by Reid
