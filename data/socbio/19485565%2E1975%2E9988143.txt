Demographic Implications of the Biological Determinants of Female Fecundity

The onset and maintenance of regular menstrual function in the human female are each dependent on the maintenance of a minimum weight for height, apparently representing a critical fat storage (Frisch, 1974, 1975; Frisch and McArthur, 1974; Frisch et al., 1973). These recent findings imply that undernutrition and energy-requiring activities may affect the fecundity of marginally nourished populations far more than has been realized.
The purpose of this paper is to show how an environmental factor that affects physical growth, such as nutrition, can affect the time of attainment and level of function of each reproductive event in the female, thus affecting the length of the reproductive span and reproductive efficiency. In addition to nutrition, other environmental or endogenous factors may also be important, such as slower growth due to altitude (Frisch and Revelle, 1970, 1971a) or genetically determined slower rates of growth (Frisch, 1972). All these factors may interact with each other (Figure 1) and with cultural practices affecting fertility, such as a taboo on intercourse

during lactation (Short, 1974). For simplicity, the effects of only the most important variable, nutrition, will be related to each reproductive milestone shown in Figure 1.
VIABILITY OF THE INFANT
Starting at the beginning of the cycle (Figure 1), the survival of the infant, the most important determinant of reproductive success, is directly correlated with birth weight; the higher the birth weight, the better the infant's chance of survival (Frisch, 1972). The birth weight of the infant, is correlated with the prepregnancy weight of the mother and her weight gain during pregnancy, each acting independently and with additive effects (Eastman and Jackson, 1968). The events of the adolescent growth spurt and the minimal weights necessary for the onset and maintenance of normal menstrual cycles determine that the prepregnancy weight of the mother is in a particular weight range, representing a critical body composition.

The maintenance of regular ovulatory cycles is related to a minimum level of fat storage and is thus directly affected by undernutrition and energy-draining activities, such as lactation.

than normal prenatal growth (Frisch, 1971; Frisch and Revelle, 1971a), will determine the time of onset of the adolescent growth spurt, since it has been shown that spurt initiation is related to the attainment of an average critical weight (about 30 kg. in United States girls), representing a particular body composition (Frisch and Revelle, 19713; Frisch et al., 1973).
Well-nourished middle-class girls in the United States initiate the adolescent growth spurt on the average at 9.S years (Frisch and Revelle, 197\b). However, in Belgium in 1835, children grew more slowly because of poorer nutrition and child care, and the average age of initiation of the adolescent spurt of girls was about 12 years (Quetelet, 1869).

MENARCHE
The interval from initiation of the growth spurt to menarche is completed in an average of three years for well-nourished United States and European girls (Frisch and Revelle, 1971a). Belgian girls of over a century ago apparently grew more slowly during the adolescent spurt, as well as before the spurt, so that this interval to menarche was about 4.5 years (Quetelet, 1869).
Menarche normally follows the period of most rapid weight gain (peak weight velocity shown in Figure 1) and takes place on the average at 47 kg. for United States, English, Finnish, Dutch, and Belgian girls. At present, this weight is attained by these girls between 12.8 and 13.0 years (Frisch, 1975), as was also

true three or four decades ago (Frisch and Revelle, 1970, 1971a). However, in 1895, United States girls attained that mean weight at 14 years and in 1835 Belgian girls attained that weight at 16.5 years (Frisch, 1972).
Girls more than double their stored fat during the adolescent growth spurt, as a study of the components of the critical weight showed. The mean weight at menarche represents a body weight composition of about 20-24 per cent fat, which is attained at varying heights and weights within a population (Frisch, 1974; Frisch et al., 1973.)
MINIMUM WEIGHTS FOR MENARCHE

from menarche to ages 16-18 (Frisch and McArthur, 1974).
Menstrual function stops in girls and women ages 16 years and over when body weight falls below the minimum fatness level and is restored following a gain in body weight sufficient to restore fatness above the minimum level. These fat changes correspond to a change in body weight of 10-15 per cent. One would then expect that marginally nourished women would have irregular menstrual cycles, as has been observed (Solien de Gonzalez, 1964), and that in severe undernutrition, menstrual cycles would cease completely, as has also been observed (Frisch and McArthur, 1974).

A minimum level of fatness, about 17 per cent of body weight, is associated with the onset of menstrual cycles and their continued maintenance soon after menarche. Menstrual function ceases when the body weight composition falls below that fatness level, corresponding usually to a loss of weight in the range of 10-15 percent, and is restored with weight gain above the minimum fatness level (Frisch and McArthur, 1974; Crisp and Stonehill, 1971).
STABLE REPRODUCTIVE ABILITY
A heavier minimum weight for height, representing an increased amount of fat, about 22 per cent of body weight, is necessary for the maintenance of regular menstrual function in girls and women age 16 years and over. For example, the minimum weight for onset of menses for a woman 18 years old whose height is 165 cm. (55 inches) is 49 kg. (108 lbs.), whereas the minimum weight for a girl 14 years old of the same height is only 43.5 kg. (96 lbs.). These heavier minimum weights reflect the increase in fatness which takes place in both early and late maturing girls

ADOLESCENT STERILITY
These findings suggest that the period of adolescent sterility after menarche, when many menstrual cycles are anovulatory (Short, 1974) and when there is greater pregnancy wastage (National Academy of Sciences, 1970), may last until stable body composition at high fat storage levels is attained (Figure 1). Interestingly, there is continued rapid growth of the ovary and uterus during this interval (Scammon, 1930).
These data also suggest that undernutrition would lengthen the period of adolescent sterility. In a well-nourished population, the adolescent sterility interval is now about 3.5 years, from 12.9 ± 0.1 years at menarche to 16-18 years on the average, judging from the leveling off of changes in body composition (Frisch and McArthur, 1974) and from the pregnancy wastage data (National Academy of Sciences, 1970). However, the interval may be 4.5 to 5 years at present in an undernourished population, and it may have also been that long in the past. One would then expect that a late age of menarche, for example, 16.5 years as found in the middle of the

nineteenth century (Tanner, 1962; Backman, 1948), would be associated with a rather late age at birth of the first child, such as 22 or 23 years.
LACTATIONAL AMENORKHEA
The idea that a minimum level of stored energy is required for the maintenance of regular ovulatory menstrual cycles can explain variation in the length of lactational amenorrhea, a major determinant of birth interval in many populations (Short, 1974). Lactation has very high energy demands, requiring about 1,000 calories per day (FAO, 1957). Short (1974) points out that lactation is a much greater nutritional stress than pregnancy, because the mammary gland transfers energy from mother to offspring with less efficiency than does the umbilical cord.
The breast milk of undernourished women does not differ in calories or protein from the breast milk provided by well-nourished women, although the amount may decrease seriously when the mother is severely undernourished, and the vitamin content may be inadequate (Frisch, 1971). Thus, the undernourished woman draws on her own energy stores for the provision of adequate food for the growth and development of her infant. An undernourished woman would therefore be slower to regain the minimum energy levels required for the restoration of ovulatory cycles.
Pregnancy has high energy requirements; about 50,000 extra calories are needed to maintain a pregnancy to term (Frisch, 1975). About 120,000 extra calories are needed for lactation over a minimum period of four months. Thus, a poorly nourished woman would be expected to have a longer period of amenorrhea while lactating than a well-nourished woman, as has been actually observed (Short, 1974; Solien de Gonzalez, 1964.)

The weight of the mother at the time of her attainment of stable reproductive ability, which we have seen has been determined to be above a predictable minimum level of fatness, affects the birth weight of the baby, and thus the cycle begins all over again (Figure 1).
AGE TO MENOPAUSE
One more time interval must be added to complete the reproductive span--the time to menopause. Menopause is earlier in undernourished populations than in well-nourished populations, although there is apparently no individual correlation between time of menarche and time of menopause (McMahon and Worcester, 1966). The factors involved are still not known, although it is tempting to speculate that the loss of lean body weight which begins in American women at age 45 (Forbes, 1972) has something to do with the time of menopause, just as a change in the fat/lean ratio may be associated with menarche (Frisch et al., 1973; McCance and Widdowson, 1974).
CONCLUSION
When the observed fertility rate of a population is lower than is normally found in a well-nourished noncontracepting population--for example, the lower rate found in India (Gopalan and Naidu, 1972; Wyon and Gordon, 1971) or among the Bushman (Singer and Weiner, 1963), as compared to that among the well-nourished Hutterites (Short, 1974)--the lower fertility could be explained wholly or in part by inadequate nutrition causing delayed menarche, longer than normal adolescent sterility, irregularity or cessation of menstrual function, higher pregnancy wastage, longer lactational amenorrhea, and early menopause.
Therefore, Figure 2 adds a new pathway to Wrigley's diagram (1969) of the effect of nutrition on fertility. In addition to the

Suppose that such methods are actually not widely used andthat the frequency of abortion is low, as McKeown and Brown (1955) suggest may have been the case historically. An alternate explanation for the lowered fertility could be low fecundity for all the reasons outlined above, interacting with cultural taboos that also decrease fertility. Policy decisions on contraception would be much affected if the alternate explanation is true, entirely or in part.
An important biological question also remains to be answered. What body com-
