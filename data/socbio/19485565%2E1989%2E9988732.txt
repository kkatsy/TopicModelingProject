ABSTRACT: Although the fertility decline in the black population in the Mississippi Delta between the late 1870's and early 1930's closely paralleled that of the national black population, it rose much more dramatically in the 1940's and 1950's to almost 1880 levels. Given the especially rural and oppressed conditions of blacks there, the initial decline seems puzzling. Low fertility rates in the 1930's reflected a large proportion of childless females. Investigations of changing contraceptive usage and mate exposure suggest both were minor components at most. Several physiological impairments were investigated including dietary deficiences, malaria, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted diseases (STD). Evidence suggests STD played the major role, facilitated by nutritional and other health problems. Models relying heavily on those developed by McFalls and McFalls (1984) suggest 50-80 percent of the decline could have been due to the spread of STD. Age-specific birth rates for different periods and post-WorldWar-II fertility increases seem consistent with this finding.

The decline in the American black total fertility rate (TFR) from around 7 in the 1870's to under 3 in the 1930's (Coale and Rives, 1973) has puzzled demographers because throughout the period blacks remained largely rural, impoverished, poorly educated, and in the South. Farley (1970) argued that most of the decline was involuntary, with the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) being the main factor. McFalls (1973) rebutted Farley's arguments concerning the role of STD and presented a model that purported to demonstrate that STD could not have played the major role. He concluded (p. 18): "I believe that the black fertility trend was probably fashioned by essentially the same traditional factors that determined

its white counterpart, although health factors undoubtedly played a more important role in the former."
McFalls' arguments were regarded as devastating to the "VD hypothesis" by a number of researchers investigating the decline during the 1970's (Meeker, 1977; Higgs, 1977; Engerman, 1978; Lantz and Hendrix, 1978; Immerwahr, 1976). Excepting the work of McFalls and coresearchers, only two studies appearing since 1973explore the role of involuntary factors in the decline. Cutright and Shorter (1979) evaluated Farley's arguments, found those advanced for the influence of gonorrhea to be the most persuasive, and suggested that puerperal fever and rickets also played key roles. Wright and Pirie

(1984) offered the only critical analysis of McFalls' arguments and concluded, on the basis of a study correlating syphilis and child-woman ratios (CWRS) by county in a six-state area in the South, that the spread of STD was an important component of the decline. Tolnay (1985), however, argued that the Wright and Pirie "estimation technique commits the fundamental error of attributing causality to a correlation" (p. 3). In his pioneering study of the age-specific patterns of the fertility decline from 1885 to 1900, Tolnay (1981) observed that the patterns of the rural population did not appear to suggest a widespread adoption of conscious fertility control. More recently (1986), he argued that expanding educational opportunities eventually penetrating into rural areas were the main stimulus for the fertility decline. While Farley and Allen (1987) have again reiterated the "VD hypothesis," this view is decidedly a minority one.
Perhaps ironically, the most important research that has been undertaken on the role of involuntary factors in the decline has involved McFalls, either singly (1979a, b; 1981) or in collaboration (McFalls and Masnick, 1981; Masnick and McFalls, 1978; McFalls and McFalls, 1984). The latter synthesizes impacts of infectious diseases on fertility, addresses the importance of the spread of genital tuberculosis in the black fertility decline, and presents models to measure its impact as well as that of STD.
This study examines the possible roles that various voluntary and involuntary causes may have had in the black fertility decline observed in the Delta counties and parishes bordering the Mississippi River: Concordia, Madison, Tensas, and East Carroll parishes in Louisiana; Issaquena, Coahoma, Wash-

ington, Bolivar, and Tunica counties in Mississippi; and Chicot, Desha, Phillips, Crittenden, and Mississippi counties in Arkansas. Given the CWRS existing in the area in 1880 and 1930, the general fertility rate (GFR), or births per 1,000 women aged 15-44, was estimated to have declined from 243 in 1875-79 to 98 in 1925-29 (Wright, 1986). In the latter period, the GFR was only two-thirds of the southern black average when standardized for the proportions living in rural farm, rural nonfarm, and urban areas. These changes suggest a decline in the TFR from at least 7 to about 3.
Corrected vital statistics data show a bottoming out of the GFR to the low 90's during the early 1930's (Figure 1). By 1940 the rate was over 100 and in 1947 had risen 125. A rapid rise to over 200 by the mid 1950's was maintained in the latter part of the decade. Although birth rates in both the national white and nonwhite populations increased during the "Baby Boom," the increase in the local black population was much more dramatic. In contrast, the GFR in the local white population bottomed out at 107 in the late 1930's, and the much more modest post-war increase crested in 1948 with birth rates declining thereafter. Among whites, the "Baby Boom" was least marked in the South, and southern white farmers were the one group that did not participate in it (Rindfuss and Sweet, 1977).
Given the overwhelmingly rural, impoverished, and poorly educated nature of the area black population in the early twentieth century and the changes after World War II which resulted in increased urbanization, declining demand for child labor, rising educational levels, greater economic insecurity engendered by mechanization, and the partial trans-

FIG. 1.--Changes in the estimated white and black GFR's in the study area and in the national white and non-white GFR's, 1925-60. Data are corrected for underregistration of births and estimated underenumeration of females, 15-44. Births for black and whites in the study area are assumed to be 65 and 75 per cent complete, respectively, in 1925-29. Linear improvements in registration are assumed between 1930-40 and 1940-50. Underenumeration of births is assumed to have been reduced by half between 1950-60, with linear improvement in the period.

formation of a sharecropping population to an agricultural laborer population, both the initial decline and later rise seem puzzling. As general problems confronting blacks in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were epitomized in the Delta, an understanding of the chief causes of the fertility changes there gives insight into those in the national black population.
This study follows the recommendations of McFalls and Masnick (1981) that any study of the black fertility decline must examine changes in birth control, mate exposure, and fecundity. A brief overview of the area is presented first. TFR and age-specific birth-rate

(ASBR) patterns for different periods are then examined. The study then shifts to a consideration of the three abovementioned considerations with special attention given to pellagra, malaria, genital tuberculosis (TB), and STD as possible factors in the initial decline.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
OVERVIEW OFTHE STUDY AREA
The term "Mississippi Delta" generally refers to the study area plus the bootheel area of Missouri and a number of counties in Mississippi, i.e., Humphreys, Leflore, Quitman, Sharkey, and

Sunflower, that do not front the Mississippi River. The bootheel counties were excluded from the study because of a lack of data by race for many important items.
Given the expenses of clearing the land and flood control, the avoidance of the area by white yeoman farmers because of malaria, and the superior qualities of the alluvial soil for growing cotton, the area was developed largely in plantations worked first by slaves and then by black sharecroppers. Prior to 1880 the population was entirely rural, and as late as 1940 the census showed 77 per cent of all blacks living on farms with the remainder equally in rural nonfarm and urban areas. In 1960, nearly threeeights lived in urban areas with the remainder evenly divided between farm and nonfarm areas.
Prior to the Depression, the modified plantation system developed after the Civil War remained intact with few modifications (Johnson, 1941). According to the 1929 agricultural census, only 4 per cent of black farm operators owned their land, while 67 per cent were sharecroppers, splitting the crop minus expenses with the landowner, often hopelessly in debt, and regarded both in law and practice as laborers paid by a share of the crop. Plantation owners were sources of both credit and authority, usually paternalistically exercised (Stone, 1908).
Cotton prices dropped from over 30tf apound in the late 1860's to a low of 4.60 in 1894. Prices improved thereafter, but the arrival of the boll weevil around 1910 caused lower crop yields, although damage was much greater to the east of the Delta. Prices jumped briefly to over 30(2 a pound at the end of World War I and then slumped to 6<tby 1932. Changes in living conditions are difficult

to document, although they certainly followed cotton prices at least to some extent. Descriptions of living standards in the 1870's (Pickens, 1923; Painter, 1976) read depressingly like those of the 1930's (Grubbs, 1976; Kestor, 1936; Daniels, 1938). The common practice of the landlords of declaring accounts even at the end of the year, no matter what the crop was (Cantor, 1969), kept living conditions minimal.
Living conditions improved somewhat during the Depression with the partial recovery of cotton prices as a result of AAA policies, the requirement that payments for land taken out of cotton production be shared with tenants (although this provision was often ignored in practice), and the use of such land to grow vegetables for home consumption (Powdermaker, 1937). Conditions greatly improved during World War II as a result of high cotton prices and military wages for individuals in the service which far exceeded wages paid on plantations. After the war, mechanization proceeded rapidly. By the mid 1950's many workers had been forced off the plantations, and most of the rest were converted into agricultural laborers. Those displaced left the area or accumulated in the fetid slums of the local settlements (Aiken and Demerath, 1968). The median black family income computed from the 1960 census was $1,383, compared to the U.S. nonwhite median of $2,520 and the local white median of $4,555.
This was not a population that would seem likely to have reduced its TFR from 7 to under 3 voluntarily prior to the mid 1930's. In order to evaluate the likelihood that voluntary fertility limitation was largely responsible for the decline, it is instructive to examine first agespecific fertility patterns.

there was apparently either a considerable use of contraception, a high rate of sterility, or a combination of both. The 1959-60 urban ASBR's suggest a somewhat later fertility start than in the rural area, but otherwise similar ASBR's to age 30. Relative drops thereafter dosuggest increasing use of birth control, but increasing fecundity impairments with age cannot be ruled out.
Comparison of ASBR's of 1939-40 and 1959-60 by race (not shown) reveal contrasting patterns, in that white fertility in the 15-19 age group, when controlled for residence, was typically less than half that for blacks, peaked sharply in the 20-24 age group, and declined substantially thereafter, especially between the 25-29 and 30-34 age groups. For whites, the patterns suggest marriage typically between ages 18-22 and increasing use of birth control after several years of marriage and attainment of the desired number of children.
In summary, patterns of change in the TFR in the white and black populations differed markedly, suggesting different forces at work. Concerning the black population, apparently the entire period from the 1870's to 1960 was marked by sexual relations often beginning at puberty and many teen births. However, given the fact that most girls in 1939-40 were probably not highly fecund before age 16, 1939-40 ASBR^s suggest that fertility peaked by age 21, or even earlier, and then began to decline rapidly. In contrast, fertility patterns up to age 40 in the countryside by 1959-60 appear to have been similar to those in the countryside eighty years earlier. Patterns noted for the larger urban areas are more suggestive of voluntary fertility control in both periods, but with a strong involuntary component in

the former. With this background, the documentary evidence on voluntary fertility control in the former period can be investigated.
WAS CONTRACEPTION EXTENSIVELY
USED?
During the New Deal, the Delta was the object of a number of sociological studies. None, even those noting relatively small families, made any mention of contraception. Cohn (1935, p. 85) bluntly asserted: "The use of contraceptives among the Delta Negroes is almost unknown although in the towns there is some knowledge of contraceptive devices. . . . The majority of Negroes here see no need for contraceptives." A study of a number of white sharecropping families in the 1930's revealed little interest in and apparently little practice of contraception (Dobb, 1937). Given the lower educational levels, lesser chances for upward mobility, and paternalistic attitudes of plantation owners toward them, poor blacks would seem to have been even less likely candidates to practice birth control extensively. The local white view (Stone, 1908;Alexander, 1945; Cohn, 1935; Percy, 1941) of black sharecroppers as being "present" oriented and not planning for the future was not contradicted bysociological studies (see especially Dollard, 1937, and Powdermaker, 1937), although the latter ascribed institutional rather than racial reasons.
Neither the Dollard nor the Powdermaker study of the same small town in the Delta mention the use of birth control among blacks, but their descriptions of "respectable blacks" (for whom education was stressed and aspirations for children were high) do seem to suggest that contraception could have been

220

practiced in this group. Although no studies of the urban blacks mention induced abortion, it is known that blacks in northern cities often resorted to this option (see especially Lane, 1986). Given the expense of raising children and a high proportion of adult black females without spouses in the Delta towns, it is conceivable that abortion was often resorted to.
Concerning the farm population, studies addressing the value of children prior to World War II (see, especially, Powdermaker, 1937) agree on the following points: (1) children were an economic asset because they could work in the cotton fields and the size of a sharecropping plot was based on the number of working "hands"; (2) schooling did not hinder working in thefieldsas blacks were expected to attend school only when there was no work to be done; and (3) large families were desired and orphans were eagerly adopted, especially by families with no children. In such circumstances, induced abortions were probably rare, given the fact that even if a child-to-be was not wanted by a woman, a transfer could easily be arranged with relatives or others. These values were hardly congruent with fertility levels observed in the 1930's.
It is difficult to isolate social or economic trends that might account for a rising use of fertility control prior to the 1930's or a declining use thereafter. Census data portray a consistent and steady fertility decline during the 18801930 period, notwithstanding tremendous fluctuations in cotton prices. Even in the 1930's, educational levels were lower in the Delta than any other area save the "Cajun" area of Louisiana. An analysis of CWR's in the late nineteenth century to 1910 showed them to be lowest in the Louisiana portion of the Delta,

notwithstanding the worst educational levels there (Wright, 1986). Apparently educational levels began to improve markedly in the 1930's (Dollard, 1937). In 1950, a milestone of sorts was achieved in Coahoma County when police checked trucks to prevent children under age 15 from working in the fields (Jones and McLauren, 1951). Although child-labor laws were often ignored even in the 1960's (Dunbar, 1969), educational opportunities were increasing at the same time the birth rate rose.
The fertility increase does not appear to have been related to economic factors. Economic conditions greatly improved during and immediately after World War II, but thereafter considerable stress and economic hardship resulted from mechanization which in the early stages reduced the need for the "male" labor of plowing and later, with the adoption of the cotton harvester, made most other manual labor redundant as well.
In summary, available contemporary evidence does not suggest that birth rate fluctuations reflected changing use of contraception, although a caveat must be added that contemporary studies everywhere in the South underestimated the use of birth control given the taboos that inhibited frank discussion of the subject. Prior to World War II, birth control was almost certainly practiced to some extent, especially in the towns.
MATE EXPOSURE
Pre-World-War-II studies (see especially Powdermaker, 1937; Dollard, 1937; and Cohn, 1935) agree that in at least the sharecropping population marital ties were loose, with common-law marriage the norm and considerable changing of partners. However, this instability does not appear to have re-

suited in greatly reduced exposure to sexual relations. Cohn (1935, p. 87) observed: "Sexual relations among the Delta Negro begin at a tender age . . . and last as long as strength allows. A girl at the age of twenty is sexually an experienced woman of the world." Other presumably less biased researchers also suggested that sexual relations typically began shortly after puberty, marriages tended to be unstable, and separations were not typically accompanied by sexual abstinence. Johnson's survey (1941) of six rural counties including Coahoma and Bolivar indicated that sexual encounters for both males and females typically began at age 14. He asserted that for the "folk Negro," which he felt to be dominant in the Delta, "sex is not, apparently, an acute problem" (p. 225). Dollard (1937) argued that the large degree of sexual freedom and indulgence in large part compensated the lowerclass blacks for their subservient position vis-a-vis the whites.
The possibility that there was a shortage of mates for females in the reproductive age groups must be considered. One approach for estimating the availability of potential mates for females in the reproductive ages is to add the numbers of males 15-44 and 20-49, divide by two, and then divide the dividend by the number of females 15-44. This averaging reflects the fact that males tend to choose somewhat younger mates. In the study area, the number of "eligible males" per 100 females in 1930, 1940, 1950, and 1960 was computed to be 86, 86, 79, and 74, respectively, compared to comparable national averages of 86, 85,87, and 86 (computed from U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1930a, 1940, 1950, 1960). However, computed rates for study area cities containing 10,000 + persons were 76,77,76, and 71,respec-

tively. Therefore, the ratio of eligible males to females actually declined during the period from 1940-60 with the pre-World-War-II mate shortage concentrated in urban areas.
An indicated low sex ratio could reflect a large number of males unattached to larger families and therefore likely to be missed in censuses. Johnson noted that over 20 per cent of the farm households in Coahoma and Bolivar counties were headed by females, compared to much lower proportions in nonplantation areas. Ironically, the plantation system did favor families containing at least two adults with one being a male, since sharecropping was labor intensive. Two censuses of the Delta and Pine Land (D&PL or "Scott") Plantation in Bolivar County, the largest plantation in the world, show the proportion of sharecropping families headed by females to have increased from 11per cent in 1925 to 33per cent in 1951, notwithstanding a doubling of the CWR from 353 to 760. On the latter date, most plowing was performed by tractors (D&PL Plantation, 1925, 1951).
In 1930,66 per cent of black females aged 14+ in the study area were married, compared to 59 per cent in the national black population (computed from U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1935). In contrast, the more detailed 1960 census tabulation showed the proportions married to be 59 and 62 per cent, respectively, and more significantly, the proportions married with spouse present to be 49 and 54per cent, respectively (computed from U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1960). Indeed, the proportions "separated from spouse" and "widowed" were much higher than those of surrounding non-Delta rural counties. As a result, only 63per cent of children under

18, compared with 67 per cent in the national black population, resided with both parents. Hence, the low indicated sex ratio by 1960 may in part reflect greater family abandonment by males. Indeed, Dunbar's (1969) description of a stranded population in a plantation area suggests a low sex ratio due both to an exodus of males between ages 18 and 25 and family abandonment. In this community there was an average offive children per family, despite the low sex ratio.
In short, the mate exposure argument for the relatively low fertility just prior to World War II loses credibility with the apparent increase in instability during the period of the rapid fertility rise. Hence, involuntary impediments to fecundity must be considered. Data on family size and pregnancy complications as they relate to this issue are presented below. A discussion on the actual impediments follows.
STERILITY AND PREGNANCY
COMPLICATIONS
Farley (1970) observed that black cohorts spending most of their childbearing years just prior to World War II were characterized by much higher proportions who were childless and at high parities (i.e., had many births) than their white counterparts. He argued that this combination reflected high rates of involuntary childlessness combined with low rates of contraception. Cutright and Shorter (1979) performed a parity progression analysis and determined that 67 per cent of the fertility decline evident in the 1907 as compared to the 1868 black female cohort was due to the increase in the proportion from 27 to 56 per cent with fewer than two births and that the increase thereafter in the completed fer-

tility in the 1934 cohort was entirely due to the decline in the proportion having fewer than two births.
Published census information does not permit a parity progression analysis here, but 1930 data on families does permit inferences concerning childlessness. Whereas the mean family sizes of the national black populations in urban, rural nonfarm, and farm areas were 3.91, 4.06, and 4.78, respectively, they were 3.12,2.98, and 3.64, respectively, in the study area (computed from U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1930fl). Computed median family sizes of 2.32, 2.18, and 2.99, respectively, in the study area (ibid.) suggest amuch higher proportion of two- and three-person families in the study area than in the nation. However, family size is affected by other factors as well as by the number of children living with parents.
More information on this issue is provided by a 1935-36 U.S.D.A. survey of black (and white) farm families in the Delta, eastern North Carolina, east central South Carolina, and central Georgia. Only families comprised of both husband and wife who had been married and lived on the same farm for at least a year were included. Nearly 10 per cent in both the Delta and Georgia, but under 4 per cent in the other two areas, were excluded as being one-person households. An undetermined, but probably sizable, number thus excluded were females in reproductive ages without children. An additional 10 per cent of families in all areas were excluded, although containing more than one family member, because a spouse was missing. Data in Table 2 pertain to the eligible families.
Evident from Table 2 are high rates of childless and two-person families and, to a lesser extent, single-child fami-

lies in the Delta as compared to the Carolina families. Georgia families occupy an intermediate position, although the lower median age of the Delta wives should have favored the presence of children. Although the earliermentioned procedure of Cutright and Shorter (1979) measured the impact of zero- and one-parity females on changes in completed fertility over time, it can also be used to measure the contribution of childless and single-child families in accounting for the difference in the average number of children in the Delta and the South Carolina (the most prolific) samples. It shows that 69 per cent of the difference was due to the greater prevalence of families with fewer than two children in the Delta, with the bulk due to childless families.
Given the exclusion from the sample of persons living alone, the common practice of young relatives and orphans livingwith childless couples, and the fact that perhaps a tenth of babies born in the Delta died before age 16, the 193536 survey suggests that perhaps onethird of Delta farm females living most of their reproductive years in the 1920's and 1930's were nulliparous and that

perhaps one-sixth had only one birth. Given the strong desire for children among farm families, this situation is certainly suggestive of widespread infecundity. Earlier cited census data on family size suggest much higher rates of childlessness in nonfarm areas.
Malnutrition, general poor health, and diseases, notably syphilis and malaria, may induce spontaneous fetal loss (SFL). Cutright (1975) estimated the nonwhite rates to be 914 (per 1,000 births) in 1940 and 460 in 1960. From these rates he calculated that if the 1960 SFL rates had existed in 1940, black marital fertility then would have been 11 per cent higher than in 1960, rather than 24 per cent lower. This argument, however, is flawed in that in the absence of contraception, the interval between two pregnancies when the first ends in SFLis much shorter than when the first results in a live birth. Keyfitz (1971) made a rough calculation that intervals between pregnancies ending in induced abortions were only 36 per cent of those ending in live births. Given the somewhat longer durations for typical pregnancies ending in SFL, 40 per cent may be a reasonable figure for pregnancies terminated by

224

SFL. In a "perfect contraceptive" population in which all pregnancies are desired, SFL will typically result in an additional pregnancy that otherwise would not have occurred, subject, of course, to the "biological time clock." Hence, although SFL does affect the birth rate, its impact is considerably less than suggested by crude figures on pregnancy wastage.
Vital statistics data on SFL are poor in that only pregnancies lasting more than twenty weeks are counted and, prior to the advent of governmentsponsored prenatal care which began in the Delta only in the 1930's as part of the syphilis control program, only a lowproportion of miscarriages were likely to be reported to authorities. Hence, Delta rates, especially for 1930, contained in Table 3 are probably understated even in relation to the national black population.
Table 3 reveals higher-than-average rates in rural areas in 1930and 1940 that, however, are well below those of Florida (10.9 in rural areas in 1930), which was characterized both by high rates of syphilis (Wright and Pine, 1984) and better reporting than the study area. Powdermaker, (1937), however, characterized fetal wastage as "extraordinarily high" (p. 57). The apparent jump in fetal deaths in the cities between 1930 and 1940 plausibly reflects both higher true rates (syphilis and tuberculosis were known to be most prevalent in cities) and the establishment of prenatal clinics in which fetal problems could be noted (although the true rate would be declining as a result). In both the nation as a whole and the study area, the recorded fetal death rate began to decline after 1930. In contrast to the nation as a whole, the noncity rate actually increased between 1950 and 1960, possi-

bly reflecting the cessation of prenatal services associated with STD clinics which were shut down in the early 1950's when the STD problem seemed under control (Smith, 1954).
It appears that SFL had much less of an impact on fertility than did sterility, although the higher-than-average recorded rate was indicative of health problems affecting fertility in other ways as well. Reflecting this modest impact was a noncity TFR of nearly 7 in 195960, notwithstanding a fetal loss rate well above the national average. This figure does not suggest that fetal losses in 1960 had a marked overall impact on fertility.
Cutright and Shorter (1979) argued that puerperal fewer reduced black fertility in the early twentieth century, but information concerning its impact on subsequent fecundity is lacking. National vital statistics data available on deaths (only a proxy for the relative incidence) beginning in 1915 show high rates among nonwhite females until a marked drop began about 1930, resulting in a decline from 40.8 (per 10,000 births) to 3.5 by 1960 (computed from U.S. Bureau of the Census, 19306, 1960). Although the area rate wassomewhat higher than the U.S. average (and, in contrast to fetal deaths, probably fairly accurately counted), the impact of puerperal fever on fertility prior to World War II is nonetheless problematic. Typical conditions of childbirth in the 1930's, on a farm attended by a midwife without special training, appear to have been similar to those existing in the 1870's. Also, in rural areas in the 1930's, there was probably a low rate of induced abortions, a frequent cause of puerperal fever when performed under unsanitary conditions.
In summary, indicators of sterility, fetal wastage, and puerperal fever all

ber. One of the two dominant culprits was plasmodium falciparum (the other being p. vivax), which McFalls and McFalls note depresses the birth rate by inducing temporary sterility in males and miscarriages in females.
A serious hindrance to attributing the fall of fertility to malaria is that malaria was rife from the time settlement began, with substantial progress against it starting with the extensive draining of swamps in the 1890's and culminating with a seven-year malaria control program starting in the Delta in 1935 that virtually eradicated the scourge (Smith, 1954). In Bolivar County, the annual incidence was estimated have declined from 70 per cent in 1910 to 50per cent in 1920 and to only 16 per cent in 1930 (Mississippi State Board of Health, 1931). Thus, progress ran counter to the fertility decline. Another discrepancy lies in the fact that blacks, especially those with the genetic sickling trait, were more resistant to malaria than whites. Despite malaria, the 1925-29 GFR of whites was computed to be a fifth higher than that for blacks in the study area (Figure 1).
In an area of Belize characterized by an extreme frequency of malaria attacks, Fischein (1961) found completed fertility of the females with the sickling trait to be 7.04, compared to 4.89 for the remaining three-quarters lacking this trait. Equally significant was the fact that 52 per cent of the births of the former, but only 42 per cent of the latter, were male, reflecting the fact that most miscarriages occurring in the group lacking the sickling trait involved male fetuses. To the extent that malaria reduced fertility through miscarriages in the Delta, this process should have been reflected in a much lower sex ratio (males per 100 females at birth) than in

the general black population. In fact, the sex ratios of black children under ages one and five in the study area were almost identical to, but usually somewhat higher than, the national black average in 1880, 1930, 1940, 1950, and 1960 (computed from U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1880, 1886, 1930, 1940, 1950, and 1960; data for intervening years not available for study area). As earlier noted, there was not a particularly high official fetal death rate prior to World War II; the earliest available data for the Mississippi portion in 1922 show a rate of 8.3 per 100births (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1922).
In summary, evidence that the fertility decline was caused by malaria is lacking, although it might once have had a mild effect. Blood tests in two Delta counties in 1927-28 suggested that attacks caused by p. vivax outnumbered those of p. falciparum by three to one (Carley and Balfour, 1929). To the extent this ratio was valid for all areas in all periods, most persons suffered from the milder variety of malaria. If a strong case cannot be made that malaria significantly depressed nineteenth century fertility in the Delta, one can assume it had no more than a mild impact on fertility anywhere in the United States.
Genital tuberculosis.--It was McFalls (1981) whofirststressed the possible importance of the spread of genital TB in the black fertility decline. After emancipation, the much greater movement combined with poor dietary conditions, and lack of genetic immunity resulted in the rapid spread of TB among blacks. Infections among blacks were much more likely to spread from the lungs and become miliary (general) in nature. If tuberculosis spreads to the genital areas, sterility may result.

Delta acquired syphilis during their reproductive lifetimes. Rosenwald testing for syphilis in six southern counties (including Bolivar) during the 1930's and published results of mass testing undertaken during "anti-VD" campaigns immediately after World War II (see Wright and Pirie, 1984, for a detailed listing) consistently showed similar rates among black males and females. One can assume that probably half of the black females aged 31-35 in the area also suffered from syphilis infections.
Gonorrhea is highly associated with syphilis because the modes of transmission are the same. Given the shorter incubation period and lack of immunity to subsequent infections, gonorrhea was much more common than syphilis. Data from the U.S. military between the world wars suggest a ratio of four cases of gonorrhea to one case of syphilis. The Navy Surgeon General, noting much higher ratios among personnel under age 25, believed the ratio to be higher (Office of the Surgeon General, 1925). If this ratio reflected conditions in the Delta, one can estimate that there was a cumulative incidence of 200 per cent among blacks reaching the age of 35. Of course, many were never infected, but others were infected many times.
As in the case of TB, the much greater mobility following emancipation allowed STD to spread. Given the extreme mobility characteristic of the black tenant and sharecropping population of the area (Hitt, 1943; Dollard, 1937) and the loose marital ties previously discussed, it is hardly surprising that by 1941 the Delta stood out as a high incidence area.
Syphilis does not directly affect fecundity, but if transmitted to the fetus causes miscarriages, stillbirths, and elevated infant mortality. Gonorrhea may

cause sterility by blocking the epidymitis in the male (epididymitis) and the fallopian tubes in the female (pelvic inflammatory disease or PID). In this century, chlamydia trachomatis has been recognized as a separate STD with generally mild symptoms, but with the same sterility-producing effects as gonorrhea. It is now considered to be more common than gonorrhea, infecting three million Americans each year (Sweet and Gibbs, 1985). Its prevalence in the Delta, or indeed anywhere in the United States prior to World War II is unknown.
McFalls' original model (1973), developed to estimate the role of STD on the national black fertility decline, contained a number of erroneous assumptions (Wright and Pirie, 1984). This fact was implicitly recognized in the revised model presented in McFalls and McFalls (1984), which will hereafter be labeled the MF Model. This model (actually three in that "high," "moderate," and "low" estimates were generated) is much improved as it is based on extensive research. As such, it deserves serious scrutiny in suggesting to what extent the low fertility in the Delta in the 1930's could have been due to the spread of STD.
McFalls and McFalls (1984) assume that in 1880 the incidence of syphilis and gonorrhea was 2-4 per cent with a 4:1 ratio of new gonorrhea to syphilis infections. This assumption is unverifiable, but does not seem to be unrealistic. They assume that since the World War II serologic tests showed that 35.7 (which they cited as 35) per cent of black males aged 31-35 tested positive, the true incidence could not have exceeded 30 per cent because those examined were not a random sample of the general population. In the case of the Delta, few blacks could earn deferments for oc-

cupational reasons and, as the Scott Plantation president noted, joining the military was an attractive option for heads of families because the benefits based on the number of dependents were more generous than those available from sharecropping (Kirby, 1987). An analysis of the World War II serologic tests showed that among blacks (although not whites) there were no differences by occupation or marital status that were statistically significant when age was controlled for (Usilton et al., 1945). These findings were replicated in the mass testing of blacks in Savanna at the conclusion of the war (Bowdoin et al., 1949). Therefore, it seems that the figure derived from the tests is roughly applicable to the entire black male population.
McFalls and McFalls (1984) argue on the basis of 1962 national prevalence data that if the male incidence rate for syphilis was 30 per cent, it was only 21.4 per cent for females. On the basis of evidence earlier presented, it is invalid to assume any difference existed by gender prior to the late 1940's.
They extrapolate the estimates for the total incidence of gonorrhea by assuming it was four times as prevalent as syphilis among both males and females. Although earlier mentioned military data support this assumption, it may be inaccurate for two reasons: (1) There is no medical evidence that there is a gender differential in the probability of acquiring syphilis from a single exposure, but it is clear that in the case of gonorrhea females are much more vulnerable; and (2) the literature on syphilis does not suggest a differential susceptibility by race, but this is not true for gonorrhea.
On the former point, one estimate is that the probabilities of contracting gon-

orrhea from a single heterosexual encounter with an infected partner are 2030 and 50 per cent for a male and female, respectively (Zinner, 1985). Another estimate gives the probabilities as 20-25 and 80-90 per cent, respectively (Sweet and Gibbs, 1985). Concerning the latter point, one study cited by Berg (1985) found that the gonorrhea rate in black males was twice that for whites even after correcting for the number of exposures and partners. Another study cited by Berg (1985) suggested this differential did not exist for other types of STD. It appears that persons with blood type B are especially susceptible to gonorrhea, and blacks are much more likely than whites to have this blood type. For these reasons, using a 4:1 ratio for estimating gonorrhea rates seems too conservative, especially for females.
McFalls and McFalls (1984) argue that on the national level only half of the black population was ever "at risk." While this estimate cannot be evaluated here, it is clear from earlier cited studies that a much higher proportion in the Delta was at risk.
Their estimate that a fifth of male gonorrhea cases were complicated by epididymitis and that sterility resulted a third of the time seems reasonable. Although their estimate that 20 per cent of female infections developed into PID, with sterility resulting 70 per cent of the time, also seems reasonable for the general population before antibiotics, a number of studies (see especially Holmes et al., 1980) have shown that black females are especially vulnerable to having a given infection develop into PID. Whether this was true prior to World War II is unknown; but given the poor health conditions and nutrition of blacks in the rural South, it would ap-

pear to be likely. At least part of the contemporary difference appears to be the relatively greater incidence of a strain of gonococcus among whites that is less likely to cause PID (Handsfield, 1984). This strain, which is relatively resistant to penicillin, has apparently flourished since 1945.
McFalls and McFalls (1984) assert that the average female in an uncontrolled fertility situation would have averaged at least two children prior to gonorrhea-induced sterility. The assumption was relaxed to 1.5 children in the "high" model. The average is based on the assumption that coitus typically began at age 18, the initial syphilis and presumably gonorrhea infection developed at age 22.3 years, and sterility typically developed about 66 months after initial coitus.
Earlier presented evidence suggests that an estimate of a median age of 1415 for the initiation of coitus is more realistic for the Delta. Presumably, the average age of initial infection was 18-19 years. That this assumption is not out of the realm of possibility is shown by a survey of 412 males (406 of whom were black) in Delaware being treated for syphilis. Questioning and examination revealed that 374 had suffered from at least one previous attack of gonorrhea and that the average age at first infection was 19 years (Cameron and Chapman, 1944).
Westrom (1980) found that in Sweden the risk of developing PID for sexually active girls age 15 during a one-year period was one in eight, dropping to one in 10 for girls age 16, and dropping rapidly thereafter to one in 80 for sexually active females age 24. Much of this difference reflects the high incidence of promiscuity in the younger groups. Fifty per cent of 15-year-olds reported four or

more sexual partners compared to 20 per cent of women aged 18 (Westrom, 1980). However, it also appears that both the chances of contracting gonorrhea from an infected partner and of PID developing from such infections are much greater in early adolescence than later, possibly because the cervix is shorter (Bell and Hein, 1984). Hence, a figure of one birth before sterility seems more plausible for the Delta, although a high proportion of females would have been nulliparous and some would have had multiple births before the onset of sterility.
McFalls and McFalls (1984) assume that gonorrhea and syphilis victims were largely the same. The previously mentioned Delaware study supports this contention. McFalls and McFalls also assume that the probability of suffering from a subsequent infection of gonorrhea was a direct function of acquiring a previous infection and that no one suffered more than ten attacks. The Delaware study indicated that 70 per cent suffering from an initial infection were subsequently reinfected.
The MF model assumes that syphilis in females causes the cessation of live births for two years with no cessation of births thereafter. Medical evidence is that the chances of transmitting syphilis to the fetus does decline with duration, with recent research indicating no chance of transmission after eight years (Sparling, 1984). Hence, their assumption does not appear to be grossly inaccurate in estimating the impact of syphilis on fertility.
As to whether STD could have led to reduced fertility via reduced mate exposure, Cohn's admittedly biased observations (1935, p. 87) are pertinent here: "The spread of venereal diseases among Delta Negroes is accelerated by their re-

232

fusal to interrupt sexual activities while infected, and because many of them think that a cure can be had by infecting another person." Rural blacks participating in the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiment likewise did not regard syphilis as requiring different precautions from any other ailment (Jones, 1981). Therefore, it appears fertility inhibiting impacts of STD were medical, rather than social, in nature.
Given this background, models can be constructed to estimate the proportion of the decline that may have occurred due to the spread of syphilis and gonorrhea. The models rely heavily on the work of McFalls and McFalls (1984), but differ from their model on a number of key assumptions.
RESULTS
STD AND THE FERTILITY DECLINE: MODELS OF IMPACT
Assumptions based on earlier presented evidence concerning the magnitude of the fertility decline in the Delta and sexual behavior there, the nature of syphilis and gonorrhea, and assumptions contained in the MF model concerning the national incidence of syphilis and gonorrhea around 1880 were as follows: Three per cent of the black population in the Delta around 1880 acquired syphilis; new gonorrhea infections outnumbered those of syphilis by four to one; males and females suffered in equal numbers; the TFR declined from 7 to 3 in the period from 1880 to 1940in the Delta; 80per cent of the population around 1940were "at risk" (i.e., engaged at some time in sexual activities outside of marriage with other non-

virgins and/or married) with 90 per cent of this number contracting at least one gonorrhea or syphilis infection; and the chance of suffering from a subsequent gonorrhea infection was directly proportional to that of acquiring the previous one.
Four models were developed. For the estimate of the "low" incidence of gonorrhea, I assumed that 50per cent of the population acquired syphilis and that the incidence of gonorrhea was 200 per cent. The high incidence rate was due the tendency of gonorrhea infections to be spontaneously cured within a few months, even in the absence of treatment, and the lack of acquired immunity to subsequent infections. However, only 65 per cent of the population suffered from at least one attack, and the probability of suffering a subsequent infection up to ten infections was 67 per cent. For the estimate of the "high" incidence of gonorrhea, I assumed that there were six cases of gonorrhea for each case of syphilis, the justification being earlier cited studies suggesting greater vulnerability of females and blacks to gonorrhea infections. In the "high" model, the chance of a subsequent gonorrhea infection is raised to 80 per cent. The assumption of a 6:1 ratio is probably more accurate for-females, given their greater vulnerability. Table 5 shows the estimated spread of syphilis and gonorrhea in the Delta population under both the "high" and "low" assumptions.
In developing the "low" model on the impact of gonorrhea on fertility, I used the MF model assumptions of 20 per cent of female infections developing into PID with sterility resulting in 70 per cent of the cases and a like proportion of male infections developing into epididymitis with sterility occurring a third of

the time. In the "high" model, 25 per cent of both male and female infections developed into sterility threatening complications with sterility occurring 40 and 80per cent of the time among males and females, respectively. The high estimate reflects the facts that malnutrition, pellagra, and general poor health may have increased the risk of complications and resultant sterility, and that black females appear to be more vulnerable to gonorrhea infections developing into PID than their white counterparts. Again, the "high" estimate appears more likely to be applicable to females. The MF model assumption that the chance of sterility occurring from a given attack is independent of that of the previous attack and that a person can become sterile only once is adopted here.
Proportions infected and rendered sterile by gonorrhea under the two sets of assumptions are shown in Table 6. McFalls and McFalls (1984) argue that to compute the impact on overall fertility, one should add the male and female percentages rendered sterile, multiply the two figures, and subtract the product, since the sterility of one partner is sufficient to prevent conception. This is a conservative approach and is adopted

here. In contrast to the MF models, there is an assumption of one birth before the onset of sterility. Each female syphilis infection is assumed to have resulted in 0.5 births prevented. Therefore, the increase of 47 per cent in the proportion suffering from syphilis resulted in the prevention of 0.235 births in all variants of the model.
Given these assumptions, an average of 2.01 births were averted in the low incidence, low impact model, or just over half of the decline of four births in the 1880-1940 period. Calculations for the low incidence but high impact, high incidence but low impact, and high incidence and high impact models yield estimates of 65, 66, and 81 per cent, respectively. While the last mentioned estimate seems too high, the conservative estimate of half is probably too low, given the greater vulnerability of both blacks and females to contracting gonorrhea infections, the apparently increased risk of gonorrhea developing into PID among black females, and the poor health and nutritional conditions reducing resistance to STD. Chlamydia trachomatis may have had an additional impact, although it is impossible to determine whether it was common in the era before antibiotics.

STD CONTROL EFFORTS AND
FERTILITY CHANGES
Concerted efforts to combat STD in the Delta started in the 1930's with extensive screening and the initiation of "rapid treatment" centers for treating syphilis (see Mississippi State Board of Health, 1933-41). Efforts in the 1930's were less strenuous against gonorrhea, but the dissemination of sulfa drugs on a widespread basis did reduce the incidence of fertility threatening complications.
Although efforts against STD were intensified during World War II (Cohn, 1947), progress against gonorrhea was probably minimal before the discovery that penicillin was effective against both syphilis and gonorrhea. In 1944 it was used at the rapid treatment centers and by 1945 it was prescribed generally for STD as well as for a variety of other ailments. However, it was after World War II that a coordinated effort was made to eradicate both gonorrhea and syphilis.
This effort is best documented for the Mississippi counties. Efforts there began in 1947with mass testing of the adult population in Quitman County and treatment by penicillin (Gray et al., 1949), and extended throughout the Delta in early 1948. Serologic testing showed the incidence of syphilis among blacks to be 25 per cent in 1948 (an improvement from 1941) and 3 per cent by 1953 (Smith, 1954). Similar progress was made against gonorrhea. In 1952 the program was terminated due to a lack of new treatable cases. Greatly helping the success of the program was the enthusiastic support of plantation owners desiring an improved labor force (Gray etal. 1949).
Figure 1 shows that the GFR was in

the low 90's in the early 1930's and in the neighborhood of 100 in the late 1930's. It rose during World War II and is estimated to have been 127 in 1947. It would not appear that more than a small part of this increase could be accounted for directly by the anti-STD efforts, but improvements in general health resulting from the eradication of pellagra and malaria, generally improved diets, and efforts made against TB could have made the population relatively more resistant to STD and resulting complications as well as modestly improving fecundity independent of influences of STD. The experience of the Scott Plantation is instructive. As a result of the anti-STD efforts, the eradication of pellagra and adequate health care, the birth rate there rose by a quarter during the 1930's to a level 10 to 15per cent higher than that of surrounding Bolivar County (Dill, 1939).
From 1947 to 1956 the estimated GFR rose rapidly to 204, thereafter leveling off. This rise may be largely explainable by the partial eradication of gonorrhea and syphilis and is not inconsistent with estimates made here on what the impact of STD on fertility might have been. After peaking at 146 in 1948, the white GFR declined to 130 by 1950 and never exceeded that level during the 1950's. Also supporting this interpretation are the patterns of ASBR's for 1875-79, 1939-40, and 1959-60 that were examined earlier as well as the relatively greater TFR increase in the urban population.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
This study addressed the question of why the TFR in the Delta counties fronting the Mississippi declined from

236

around 7 in the late 1870's to under 3 by the early 1930's and then rose to around 6.5 in the late 1950's. Possibilities examined were changes in contraceptive usage, mate exposure, and fecundity.
The first possibility found little empirical support, although contraceptive practices could have escaped the notice of white researchers and local residents. While the rate of mate exposure may well have changed during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, this factor cannot have accounted for more than a small portion of the decline. The 1960census suggested a rather high rate of mate separation; nonetheless, fertility was the highest of any region in the nation. High rates of childlessness in the 1930's suggest widespread sterility. An attempt was made to evaluate the relative impacts of various impairments to fertility including those resulting from psychological causes, nutritional deficiencies, malaria, TB, and STD. The most potent cause appeared to be the spread of STD with impairments being aggravated by poor nutrition and infectious diseases. The increase in the birth rate in the early 30's suggests the impact of improved health conditions, with the much larger increase after World War II resulting from the largely successful assault on STD. Variants of a model based on the work of McFalls and McFalls (1984), but differing in key assumptions generated estimates that from 50-80 per cent of the 1880-1940 fertility decline could have been due to the spread of syphilis and gonorrhea. While the latter estimate is probably unrealistically high, the former is based on assumptions that are probably conservative. Quantifying the relative impacts of voluntary and other involuntary causes has not been attempted, although both were opera-

tive, with the former undoubtedly more important in urban areas.
Wright and Pirie (1984) estimated that 56 per cent of the post-1880 black fertility decline was due to the spread of STD. This estimate, based on the earner mentioned regression, is subject to criticism in that other factors, notably marital stability, that could be correlated with STD and exercising independent influences were not considered. Thus, the model approach developed by McFalls and McFalls (1984) and adopted here is conceptually preferable. In the Delta case, marital instability does not seem to have greatly reduced mate exposure.
Other regional studies are needed to clarify the factors associated with the initial black fertility decline. As McFalls, Masnick, Tolnay, and others have argued, its causes are complex and involve a combination of fertility control and involuntary causes. The Delta counties represent one extreme in that economic and health conditions were unusually poor, and the pervasiveness of the plantation system and white supremacyforeclosed realistic chances of blacks greatly improving their circumstances except by migration. It certainly seems plausible that studies of the decline in other regions marked by less oppressive conditions would reveal a considerably greater element of choice. More studies of this nature that focus on specific areas will do much to illuminate the relative importance of voluntary and involuntary factors in the initial black fertility decline.
