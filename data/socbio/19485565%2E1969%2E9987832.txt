It has been reported that infants with Down's syndrome show high mortality during the neonatal period. The most common causes given for these early deaths are cardiac malformations and infections of the respiratory tract (Penrose and Smith, 1966). In view of recent observations that low birth weight infants accounted for a significant proportion of perinatal mortality (Brimblecombe and Asford, 1968; Ahvenainen and Terho, 1968), it was thought of value to investigate low birth weight and early death in patients with Down's syndrome.
Data were obtained from a retrospective study on infants with Down's syndrome in metropolitan Atlanta from January, 1960 to December, 1968. Of 174 affected children, 142 (69 male, 73 female) were white and 32 (14 male, 18 female) were Negro. Thirty-six of the 174 subjects weighed 2,500 gm. or less at birth (Table 1), representing a fre-

quency of 21%.These included 26 white (9 male, 17 female) and 10 Negro (4 male, 6 female). Thirteen of these 36 children died, 7 during the first 24 hours of life while the other 6 survived from 1 to 29 months. Among the 138 patients who weighed over 2,500 gm. at birth only 14 died, 4 during the first 24 hours of life while the other 10 lived from 1 to 40 months. The difference in the mortality rates between the low birth weight and normal birth weight Down's syndrome children was statistically significant (P < 0.001). This finding indicated that low birth weight played an important role in the mortality of patients with Down's disease. Although low birth weight is often the result of a multiplicity of etiological factors (Chen et al., in press), its prognostic value with regard to mortality in Down's syndrome is reflected by the present data.
Since a high childhood mortality rate was also observed among all low birth weight children, an evaluation was conducted to determine whether low birth weight played a

more important role than Down's syndrome in early childhood death. Numerical data for the general population available for such a comparison are reported by Ahvenainen and Terho (1968). Their finding of a 25% mortality rate among low birth weight Finnish children is in close agreement with that reported by Brimblecombe and Asford (1968) for the population in Great Britain (23%). Statistical analysis revealed no

significant difference in mortality rates (0.25 > P > 0.10) between lowbirth weight children in the general population and low birth weight Down's syndrome children in our population (see Table 2). These results implicate low birth weight rather than Down's syndrome as the important contributing factor in early childhood death.
