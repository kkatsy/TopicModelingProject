ABSTRACT: A random national sample of 299 clinic dropouts from the Jamaica National Family Planning Program were interviewed at least five months beyond their first missed clinic appointment. Correlates of early (after 1 or 2 visits) versus late (3+ visits) dropping out, continued contraceptive practice, and pregnancy since visiting the clinic were identified. The Health Belief Model of "compliance" behavior is proposed as an appropriate theoretical basis for future studies of clinic dropouts.

To estimate the relative success or failure of national family programs, it has been proposed (Bracken and Kasl, 1973) that three groups of clients deserve our attention. These are: (a) women who continue to attend family planning clinics versus those who become "clinic dropouts"; (¿>) women, including dropouts, who continue to use their contraceptive versus those who become "contraceptive dropouts"; and (c) women who use their contraceptive but become "contraceptive failures" (measured by unplanned pregnancy) because of incorrect use or some inherent imperfection in the method itself. Over recent years a considerable body of information has appeared on contraceptive dropouts, or on what is also called contraceptive discontinuation or noncompliance (Whelan, 1974), and on contraceptive failure, often somewhat misleadingly called contraceptive effectiveness (Segal and Tietze, 1971).
The clinic dropout, on the other hand, has been the subject of much less intense

research interest. This is unfortunate since a considerable proportion of all women admitted to clinic programs become clinic dropouts. Furthermore, not all women who drop out of the clinic discontinue using contraception, and it would be useful to understand not only the correlates of dropping out but also of continued contraceptive practice after dropping out. It would also be of interest to ascertain what influence even a brief exposure to a family planning clinic may have on subsequent fertility and contraception.
Dropping out shows some association with the contraceptive used. Intrauterine device users tend to drop out less often than pill users (Keeny and Cernada, 1969; Population Council, 1968; Hall, 1969), although in Mexico City this difference disappeared as the observation period increased (Keller, 1971). In Jamaica, rural clients given the IUD had higher dropout rates, while urban clients had higher rates with jelly, cream, foams, diaphragm, and

condoms but not the pill (Bracken and Kasl, 1973). In some studies, dropouts have been found to be either very young or of relatively older age (Kanagaratnam and Kim, 1969; Gordis et al., 1970; Bracken and Kasl, 1973). In Mexico City, however, no differences were found on demographic variables between dropouts and active clients (Keller, 1971).
In Jamaica, other demographic variables were also significantly associated with an increased likelihood of dropping out of the program. These variables included: being single; having 2 or over 7 living children; having experienced no miscarriages; and having been most recently pregnant over a year before joining the program. The effects of union, age, and number of children were relatively independent and additive. Thus, women in legal or commonlaw marriage, between 20 and 39 years of age who had between 2 and 7 living children were most likely to stay in the program. The effects of having experienced a miscarriage were especially strong among married women of intermediate age with few living children. The effect of a recent pregnancy was particularly strong among single clients of intermediate age. The higher dropout rates among single clients and those last pregnant over a year before joining the program were found principally among rural clients (Bracken and Kasl, 1973).
In Mexico City, dropping out occurred most frequently in the period immediately after the initial clinic visit (Keller, 1971), while in Jamaica over half the dropouts did so after one or two visits. Factors differentiating early from late dropouts in Jamaica were similar to those discriminating dropouts from active clients. Thus, young women were not only more likely to drop out but also to drop out earlier rather than later (Bracken and Kasl, 1973).

Two other observations should be made about previous studies of family planning clinic dropouts. First, the calculation of dropout rates is influenced by the operational definition of dropout and by the length of observation period. These factors have differed between studies and may account for the considerable variation in reported dropout rates. Second, the interrelationships of variables found to be associated with dropping out need to be articulated into a more substantial theoretical frame work that also accounts for other factors, such as motivation and personality.
In this paper, the results of a national interview sample of Jamaican clinic dropouts are reported. The discussion is organized around the Health Belief Model (Rosenstock, 1960, 1966, and 1974) as recently modified to account for "compliance" behavior which considers factors associated with continuing medical treatment (Becker et al., 1974; Becker, 1974). Since the model is used here ex post facto, it serves only as a framework for discussing the study findings. At the same time, it suggests what may be a suitable theoretical framework for the a priori selection of variables in future studies of clinic dropouts.
MATERIALS AND METHODS The population of Jamaica is approximately 1.9 million, the birth rate 31.S, and the death rate 7.2 (all rates are per 1,000 population), giving a rate of natural increase of 24.3. This increase has led to 40 per cent of the population being under IS years of age (Nortman, 1974). As a result, large numbers of women still have their whole reproductive life ahead of them and any reduction in population growth in Jamaica must come from a reduction in individual fertility. The need for family planning was recog-

nized early in Jamaica, and the first voluntary program, the Birth Control League, was established in 1939 (Gold, 1967; Harewood, 1968). In 1967, the National Family Planning Board was established to coordinate all government efforts in family planning, and the National Family Planning Act of 1970 gave the Board full statutory powers in this area.
During its first year, the Jamaica National Family Planning Board enrolled 29,892 clients who represented 6.4 per cent of the estimated 470,000 women aged 1544 in Jamaica. During the same period, there were 28,471 occasions when a client missed a single appointment. Of clients who had missed one visit, about 70 per cent went on to miss a second visit, and 62 per cent missed a third consecutive visit.
A two-stage sampling technique was utilized to obtain clients for the study. Clinics were randomly selected from four parishes: the major urban one (Kingston) and one from each of three strata of rural parishes grouped according to their average dropout rate during the preceding twelve months. The urban parish was disproportionately oversampled because it had significantly more new admissions than any other parish. Within selected clinics, cases were identified as every tenth client whose third consecutive month of absence was reported during June, July, and August, 1969. Clinic records were checked for accuracy and to exclude clients who had returned to the clinic in the two months between the three-month period of delinquency and sampling. A five-consecutivemonth period of delinquency was selected because clients could not be interviewed as soon as they were sampled and also because it increased the observation period for examining contraceptive practice and pregnancy experience of clients after dropping out.
All interviewers were women: 6 Jamai-

cans and 2 Trinidadians--3 nurses, 3 so-
cial workers, and 2 graduate students.
Training sessions followed those developed
during a previous Jamaican fertility survey
(Back and Stycos, 1959; Stycos, 1954 and
1960; Stycos and Back, 1964) and in-
cluded: interviewing techniques, family
planning methodology, and the organiza-
tion of the Jamaican family planning pro-
gram. Interviewers were not told the proj-
ect specifically concerned clinic dropouts.
The interview lasted from 10 to 35 minutes
per respondent. No one refused to be in-
terviewed, the majority of women welcom-
ing the interview as an opportunity to fur-
ther their knowledge about family planning.1
A major problem was locating the se-
lected client. Not infrequently, especially
in the urban area, the given address re-
ferred to an area containing as many as
one hundred dwellings. Some respondents
had moved or were not home (at least
three attempted home visits were made).
Tracing clients was aggravated because the
name given at the clinic differed from the
name the client was known by to her
friends and neighbors. It was possible to
compare some variables from the interview
with data obtained from the clinic record
to ensure that the "right" person was in-
terviewed. No discrepancies were identified
during these analyses. In all, 299 former
clients were interviewed representing a 93
per cent interview response rate.
1 Interviewers were told they could answer factual questions by the woman interviewed once the interview was completed. They were asked not to give personal opinions about family planning, although this is a difficult task, and the interviewers' bias in favor of family planning must have been obvious in answering questions. This bias may have led to some contamination of responses when an interviewer revisited the same street or "yard" and interviewed a friend or neighbor. Since the sample is such a small proportion of the population, this contamination would be a rare event if it occurred at all. To further reduce the effect of rumor, we attempted to interview all clients from one area at the same time.

The results examine two issues: (1) continued contraceptive practice after dropping out, a measure of "compliance"; and (2) the pregnancy experience since visiting the clinic. In presenting the results, the statistic gamma (Goodman and Kruskal, 1954) has been used and is reported when appropriate to show the strength of observed associations together with its level of significance.
RESULTS
At the time of their first clinic visit, subsequent dropouts were, on the average, 26.9 years old (S.D. = 6.5) and single or in a common-law union2 rather than married (36.5, 41.4, and 22.1 per cent, respectively). At first pregnancy these women were, on the average, 18.2 years old (S.D., 2.9) and during the subsequent years had experienced an average of 4.6 pregnancies (S.D., 2.7) of which the majority were live births, a mean of 4.3 pregnancies (S.D., 2.5) per woman at first visit. The great majority of first pregnancies occurred outside a stable relationship (70.6, 23.0, and 6.4 per cent being single, in common-law, and in marital unions, respectively). The sampling procedures provided 190 women from urban clinics and 109 from rural ones. In all, 52.5 per cent had stopped visiting the clinics after 1 or 2 visits (35.1 per cent after 1 visit) and 47.5 per cent after three or more visits (35.1 per cent after 4-fvisits).
2 Common-law unions are stable cohabiting relationships without any legal or religious sanction. Marriage is entered into relatively late in life and represents an improvement in a woman's social status. While many common-law unions lead to marriage, this is not necessarily true, and many dissolve to be followed by another common-law union (Blake, 1961). It has been suggested that common-law unions in rural areas may be stable and more permanent, whereas in urban areas they may be of shorter duration reflecting more constantly changing liaisons (Schlesinger, 1968).

CONTRACEPTIVE EXPERIENCE OF DROPOUTS SINCE FIRST CLINIC VISIT
Approximately 90 per cent of women who subsequently dropped out of the clinic started using contraception after their first visit (Table 1). As we might expect, of the 32 women who did not start family planning, all but one made only 1 or 2 visits prior to dropping out. Women from urban clinics were almost twice as likely not to have started contraception when compared to rural women (gamma = 0.29, p < 0.05). When asked why they had not started using contraception, the most common reasons were the inconvenient opening times or location of the clinic (53.8 per cent of all responses). Other reasons, in rank order, included finding that she was pregnant, objections by partner, fear of side-effects, left the area, and lost or changed partner.
The most common method used was the pill followed by the IUD. Coitus-dependent methods (cream/foams, diaphragm, and condoms) were least likely to be chosen. Moreover, women who used the pill and IUD were significantly more likely to have made more clinic visits before dropping out (Table 1). Rural women were significantly less likely to have been given coitusindependent methods than were their urban counterparts (gamma = 0.76, p < 0.01).
Respondents were asked why they chose one method of birth control over the others. Recommendations of friends was most frequently given as a reason (19.4 per cent of all reasons), and this was particularly true of pill usage. Convenience of use also ranked high as a consideration (18.7 per cent of all reasons) and was the principal reason among IUD users. The influence of clinic personnel ranked third as a reason for choosing a contraceptive (15.0 per cent), although a disturbingly large number of women felt they had not been of-

fered a choice of contraceptives (10.2 per cent). Other reasons for choosing a method were: unsatisfactory previous experience with other methods; method was believed to be "safer"; or it was a stopgap before starting the pill (13.9, 13.2, and 2.6 per cent, respectively). No particular reason was given by 7.0 per cent. The reason for choosing a particular method was unrelated with number of clinic visits before dropping out. Women in urban areas were most likely to have been influenced by recommendations of partner and friends and the fact that the method was convenient to use, whereas rural women were influenced most by the clinic nurse or physician and the consideration that the method was safer.
Respondents who started contraception were asked: "What is the correct way to use . . . (the method chosen)." Interviewers were trained to recognize, for each contraceptive technique, errors in usage that would increase the risk of contraceptive

failure. Only 9 per cent of the respondents could not give a satisfactory answer to this question, but they were significantly more likely to have dropped out of the program early (Table 2).
Two-thirds of the respondents reported they had been troubled by contraceptive side-effects. Reported side-effects did not correlate with length of contact at the clinic before dropping out (Table 1). Women from rural clinics, however, tended to be more likely to report being troubled by their contraceptive than urban women (gamma = 0.15, />= 0.05).
A first and an additional complaint about the contraceptive were solicited and these complaints are shown, by method, in Table 2. Here, of course, we are using a selfreport measure of the client's perceived problems. While the medical validity of the symptom is uncertain, the client's own perception of the symptom may well be a reliable predictor of clinic dropout and contraceptive discontinuation. There was

an overall association between the method used and reported problems. There was a significant excess of reported side-effects among pill and IUD users compared with coitus-dependent method users (gamma = 0.25, p < 0.01). Reported nausea and fainting, bleeding, and pain were largely associated with the pill and IUD. Fatigue was a common report among pill users.
Women who had been using the pill were asked a series of questions to ascertain the extent of problems specific to that method. Approximately a third of these women reported they had missed taking the pill, but this fact was not associated with number of clinic visits before dropping out. The majority of these women (87.5 per cent) reported they had missed "taking the pill daily" rather than forgetting each month "when to begin taking a new packet of pills." Urban women were significantly more likely to miss the pill daily (gamma = 0.68, /><0.01), whereas rural women were more than twice as likely to miss taking a new packet each month (gamma = 0.49, /><0.05).
Approximately 40 per cent of respondents had used some form of family planning since dropping out of the clinic, and longer contact with the clinic prior to drop-

ping out was strongly associated with continued contraceptive practice (Table 1). Women from rural clinics were significantly less likely to have continued using contraception (gamma = 0.19, p < 0.05).
Other variables were re-examined for their association with continued practice. These analyses showed that the demographic relationships tend to reflect those reported previously between dropouts and active cases. Women who continued contraception tended to be older, of higher parity, to have had more years in school, and to have been older at first pregnancy, although none of these differences reached statistical significance. Women continuing contraception were significantly more likely to be currently married (gamma = 0.18, p < 0.01 ), and to have been married at first pregnancy (gamma = 0.22, p < 0.01) , and to have last been pregnant either within the previous year or more than three years previously (gamma = 0.12, p < 0.05).
Women who continued contraception more often stopped visiting the clinic because the time was inconvenient (gamma = 0.55, p < 0.01) and, even though they waited the same length of time at the clinic as women who went on to discontinue contraception, they were more likely

Vol. 23, No. 1

to drop out because they were troubled by the waiting time (gamma = 0.30, p < 0.01), a relationship which remained unchanged within all union categories. Not surprisingly, women who continued contraception were less likely to report being troubled by contraceptive side-effects (gamma = 0.36, £ < 0 . 0 1 ) , although 38 per cent of women continuing contraception did so in spite of side-effects. Discussion and agreement with partner did not relate to continuation of contraception when marital status was controlled. However, single women were more likely to continue using contraception if the partner did not know it was being used (gamma = 0.38, p<O.Ql). Women whose friends were supportive of family planning were also more likely to continue contraception (gamma = 0.2S, p < 0.01 ).
When respondents were asked what method was being used after dropping out, it was apparent that, compared with methods given at the clinic, there was increased reliance upon coitus-dependent methods. The principal source of supplies for these methods, in rank order, was: (1) supplies left over from clinic visit (36.9 per cent), (2) a store (18.4 per cent), (3) respondent had returned to the clinic for supplies between being sampled and interviewed (16.7 per cent), and (4) respondent had sent friends to the clinic to obtain supplies for her (15.8 per cent). Very few women had gone to another clinic (8.8 per cent) or to a private physician (3.4 per cent) for their contraceptives.
PREGNANCY EXPERIENCE SINCE DROPPING OUT
The interview enabled us to inquire about pregnancy experiences since the respondent dropped out of the clinic, and the pertinent data are presented in Table 3. Only six women stopped visiting the family planning clinic because they wanted

to become pregnant. Of the great majority of women who did not drop out because they wanted to conceive, over a quarter were pregnant at the time of being interviewed. The number of visits to the clinic before dropping out did not correlate with pregnancy. Only five of the women pregnant at interview had planned their pregnancy, and four of these women had longer contact at the clinic prior to dropping out. Over half of the women who had an unplanned pregnancy reported "using birth control at the time," but this contraceptive use did not correlate with length of previous clinic contact.
Two-thirds of the women who had become pregnant gave pregnancy as their reason for dropping out. However, women who had made three or more visits to the clinic were significantly more likely to report that they had dropped out before becoming pregnant. Over 90 per cent of the total sample expected to continue with family planning after the baby was born. This expectation was significantly greater among women who had a longer record of clinic contact.
DISCUSSION
The Health Belief Model as it may apply to continued clinic attendance, length of attendance at the clinic before dropping out, and contraception after dropping out is shown in Figure 1. A strong relationship was observed between period of clinic attendance prior to dropping out and continued contraception since visiting the clinic--the more visits before dropping out, the better the chance of continued contraception. Of interest to us in the discussion are similarities and differences in the correlates of compliance discussed in this paper.
The first group of variables considered in the Health Belief Model of compliance relate to level of psychological readiness to

attend the clinic and continue contraception. Not all of the components suggested in the model were operationalized in the study. It is probably fair to assume few women wanted to become pregnant, especially since so few of those who did conceive admitted it was planned. A measure of the strength of the wish not to become pregnant may be the number of pregnancies a woman has had and recency of last pregnancy. Women last pregnant more than one but less than three years previously were more likely to have discontinued contraception, a curvilinear relationship deserving further investigation.
A second group1 of variables concern the threat, or costs (psychological and economic), of not visiting the clinic and continuing contraception. This area is not covered by this or previous studies of clinic dropouts and merits considerable attention in future research. Variables focusing on perceived longer-term costs of childbearing, including chances of the child surviving3 as well as the more immediate costs of pregnancy, need to be explored. We have shown previously that women who had recent miscarriages were less likely to drop out and if they were a dropout to have stayed longer in the program (Bracken and Kasl, 1973). To these women, fear of miscarriage may represent an increased threat of pregnancy (possibly for superstitious as well as physical reasons) in addition to their not wanting another child.
Even women predisposed toward visiting the clinic and continuing contraception and who consider the benefits of doing so greater than the costs are unlikely to behave accordingly unless they believe there
3 For example, in Jamaica, higher child mortality has been found to be associated with mothers who have less cash income, lower standards of housing, less education, and who do not attend antenatal and child welfare clinics. However, child mortality was not influenced by having a father living in the home and the type of family group in which the child lived (McKenzie et al., 1967).

is a high possibility their behavior will be successful. Again in this study, as in others, this area was not formally considered. Responses to the open-ended question on reasons for choosing a particular contraceptive method only suggest the importance of a belief in the effectiveness of a method as well as the ability to choose that method. The accuracy of information about contraceptive methods, however, is important, and the finding that friends and partners may be more influential in the choice of a method than clinic staff is not reassuring.
Given a psychological readiness to take action, some additional event is necessary to "trigger" that action. Thus, many women still active in family planning clinics may be psychologically prepared to drop out but have not done so because their contraceptive is not troubling them. Other women may be psychologically ready to practice contraception but discontinued because their partner objected. Triggers to action are more obvious variables to study, more easily measured, and more readily verbalized by a respondent and therefore have received more attention by investigators. Contraceptive side-effects have been reported to be a principal reason for dropping out of family planning clinics and for discontinuing contraception. Women who drop out because of side-effects, however, have stayed in the program as long as those who do not report side-effects. Of course, many side-effects do not appear until a contraceptive has been used for some time, whereas others take less time to develop which may account for the absence of an association. Larger samples should permit examination of the independent and interactive effects of method, type of side-effect, and influence on behavior.
Among women who dropped out, the partner's influence was only associated with continued contraception among single women who practiced more contraception

when the partner was ignorant of its use. Other women who dropped out because of side-effects or pregnancy were not using contraception, even though their partner might support such use, whereas other women used contraception despite dropping out of the clinic and their partner's opposition.
The advice of professionals did not trigger dropping out. While a physician might advise a woman to discontinue a contraceptive method because of side-effects, he would usually prescribe an alternative method. The influence of rumor and information from friends on compliance has not been systematically studied among clinic dropouts. While rumor may influence discontinuation of contraception, as happened after the United States Senate investigation of the pill (Ross, 1970), it may play an equally important role in maintaining women as active clients and contraceptive users. This more positive aspect of rumor has to date received scant attention.
Finally, we consider a group of variables which may "modify" the relationships between psychological factors influencing readiness to act and various triggers to action. While younger women might be reluctant to practice contraception against the wishes of their partner, older women may be more resistant to their partner's opinion. We have seen that demographic characteristics--young age, being single, low parity, and few living children, for example--are quite strongly associated with dropping out, dropping out relatively quickly, and discontinuing contraception.
One of the principal reasons for our inability to accurately predict those women at high risk for dropping out of a family planning clinic, dropping out early, and discontinuing contraception after dropping out is our failure to examine the more complex relationships between psychological

readiness to act, various triggers to act, and factors modifying these relationships. The Health Belief Model of "compliance" is one way of organizing variables of interest into a testable model. The model itself, however, still requires additional development. It is not clear at the present time what the precise criteria are for calling one variable a "trigger" and another a "predisposition." Moreover, the same variable may play each theoretical role in different women. Certainly other groups of variables will also need to be considered, such as stable personality measures, psychological measures reflecting one's ability to cope with conflict (such as ego resilience), more acute measures of partner's supportiveness (and of mother's supportiveness in younger women) as well as of the influence of peers. While methodologically more difficult, it would be helpful to undertake prospective studies of compliance behavior for samples of all women admitted to family planning programs. Only after more thorough research will family planning professionals have a better understanding of who will stay in their programs, as well as the information to assist clients in complying with their own family planning decisions, rationally and free from the pressures of others.
