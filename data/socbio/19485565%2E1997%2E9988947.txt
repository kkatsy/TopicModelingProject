ABSTRACT: We tested the assumption that labor organizations possess structural arrangements that may favor specific individual abilities based on neurophysiological characteristics. As some basic abilities vary between sexes, so will the occupational performance of individuals, according to the labor organization they work for. We assumed that: (1) Females possess a higher perceptual sensibility (perceptual speed and accuracy), which allows them to discriminate rapid apparition events and fine changes in the environment, in contrast to males who have a greater ability to manage spatial relationships. (2) Organizations with a functional structure require more fine perceptual abilities and these requirements are stronger at higher levels of the hierarchy. (3) Occupational performance is related to basic abilities required for a specific task, leading women to have higher occupational performance than men in labor organizations with a functional structure. By studying the technical and administrative staff of the Universidad Simón Bolivar (Venezuela), we present evidence that women have a greater capacity for perceptual discrimination; that this capacity relates to occupational performance in a labor organization with a functional structure; and that this relation is stronger at higher levels in the hierarchy. However, the extremely small sample size available for this study limits the possible generalizations of these results to other populations.

It is well recognized that behavior is, to some extent, influenced by sex. There are a variety of psychological variables (Maccoby, 1988), and social variables (Gutek and Morasch, 1982; Kanter, 1977) which are affected by sex. From the biological perspective, sex-related differences in behavior constitute an adaptive resource and thus should possess some discernible advantage for each sex (Gouyon et al., 1993). The most important implications of the biological perspective on sex-related behavioral differences are the existence of different reproductive strategies (Jaffe et al., 1993 for example), differences in mate choice (Buss, 1989; Jaffe and Chacon, 1995), and the specialization of social tasks (Gouyon et al., 1993). Some authors postulate that the differentiation in the tasks performed by each sex during their evolutionary history produced the consequent

specialization in the development and use of given abilities (Kimura, 1992). Accordingly, it has been shown that women preserve a relatively finer perceptual discrimination capacity, while men possess a greater capacity for managing spatial relationships (Nagae, 1985; Hampson, 1990; Williams et al., 1990; Kerns and Berenbaum, 1991;Hedges and Nowell, 1995).
These differences, if purely cultural in origin, should not exist in modern societies with different assignments of roles for the sexes. Actual data, though, show that sex differences in performance of a mental rotation test and perceptual speed and accuracy tests remain unaltered. That is, women excel in tests measuring perceptual speed and accuracy, whereas men excel in tests measuring the establishment of spatial relationships (Hanske and Chen, 1985; Nagae, 1985; Allen et al., 1991;

Kerns and Berenbaum, 1991; Kimura, 1992). At the same time, other abilities do change due to changes in cultural environment (see Hyde 1990), suggesting that some human abilities are adaptive. Thus, a continuing adaptive value for persisting sex differences in certain individual abilities seems likely.
The working environment is a social environment that could reflect the adaptive importance of these sex differences. People spend a significant amount of their time at work, and work is understood to relate to the cognitive and behavioral patterns of individuals (Walker and Lorch in Litterer, 1980). There are two wellrecognized basic organizational structures affecting the working environment. The Functional structure and the Product structure (Litterer, 1980; Reitz, 1987).
Functional structures are horizontally differentiated and have a prevalence of collateral relations between the parts; therefore, the hierarchical structure acquires a pyramidal shape. The horizontal differentiation in functional structures is based on working units formed by persons with similar abilities or expertise coordinated by a supervisor (Litterer, 1980; Reitz, 1987; Melinkoff, 1990). Consequently, under these structures, more social interactions are possible between members with similar interests. The bulk of the responsibilities and conflict solving is coordinated and handled from the top of the structure. Since collateral relationships predominate, and since each functional work group is coordinated from the top, management must orient its actions toward the short term, concentrating on rapid apparition events (Reitz, 1987; Walker and Lorsch, in Litterer, 1980). Accordingly, under a functional structure, those with greater abilities to notice rapid apparition

events and fine perceptual abilities to foresee inconspicuous changes in working conditions will be the most successful.
Product structures are characterized by a vertical differentiation of the organization with an emphasis on vertical relations. Social contacts between individuals of different abilities or experience are common. The supervisory responsibilities are divided and distributed between management levels (Litterer, 1980; Reitz, 1987; Melinkoff, 1990). In product structures, decisions and conflict resolution are shared with the lower levels of the organization, and management is more related to strategic planning (Reitz, 1987). Top management in these organizations is more oriented to long-term monitoring of changes in the external environment. Here, individuals with well-developed spatial-temporal analytical abilities are more likely to be successful.
These structural arrangements may have a direct influence on the individual's success through certain cognitive-behavioral variables. Therefore, if some individual abilities are influenced by sex, and if these abilities are differently correlated to success in the two organizational structures, we might expect that in a vertical organization based on product structures males will dominate the managerial levels, whereas in horizontal organizations based on functional structures, females may perform better in managerial levels. Culture will interfere with these patterns, and thus men are found to be more prominent in certain areas despite the fact that women could perform better. If biological parameters still prevail, it should be possible to demonstrate a better performance of women in a functional structure, despite the fact that they do not predominate in functional structures at this time.

Data from different countries support these predictions. That is, most vertically organized institutions are maledominated (Acevedo et al., 1993; Kanter, 1976), an extreme example being the military. As society as a whole is thought to be male-dominated, or evolved from a male-dominated society, confirmation of male dominance in organizations with a product structure is not convincing proof for sex-related occupational performance based on differences in individual abilities. However, evidence for female dominance in functional structures, may help to support our hypothesis.
Individual ability-related performance in an organization may not be uniform. Moreover, different levels of organization may require different expertise and abilities (Melinkoff, 1990). In organizations with a functional structure, the higher levels of hierarchy have to solve day-today problems, making decisions about unexpected problems of high priority; in the lower levels, however, the tasks are not necessarily related to decision making. Therefore, higher levels of hierarchy rather than lower ones, should be more affected by the type of organizational structure (Perrow, 1970; Walker and Lorsch, 1980; Reitz, 1987). We studied the relation between sex-related individual abilities and occupational performance at various levels of hierarchy in order to detect a possible social effect of sex differences in individual aptitudes.
We predict that there are sex differences in occupational performance in organizations and that this polarization of performance is related to the hierarchical structure of the organization. If some differences in occupational performance are related to basic individual abilities dependent on sex, we might predict that in en-

vironments where individuals are exposed to rapid apparition stimuli, those individuals with high perceptual sensibility (as measured by better performance in tests measuring perceptual speed and accuracy) will possess better occupational performance. The female/male performance difference due to these abilities should also be stronger the higher we climb in the organizational hierarchy. Occupational performance and perceptual speed and accuracy should be significantly correlated in a functional structure, whereas individual abilities in establishing spatial relationships should not correlate with occupational performance nor with the hierarchical level in a functional structure. That is, in organizations with a functional structure, women should excel.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects for the study were members of the technical and administrative staff from all hierarchical levels of the Universidad Simón Bolivar (Venezuela). This organization possesses a clear functional structure as derived from a geometrical analysis of the organization chart (Melinkoff, 1990). There is a predominance of collateral relationships over linear relationships, where horizontal differentiation prevails over vertical differentiation.
The levels of this organization are: Supervisory (Level 4), which includes the staff that fulfills supervisory and coordinating functions of offices, departments, units, areas, sections, etc.; Professional (Level 3), which includes technical personnel with university degrees working in administrative areas; Administrative (Level 2), including accountants, auditing personnel, assistants of budget staff, secretaries, typists, archivists, etc.; and Technical (Level

1), including personnel specialized in technical areas, maintenance and laboratory technicians, audiovisual support staff, sports trainers, and personnel with a technical degree.
Occupational performance of employees was estimated by using a standard procedure adopted by the organization, which relies on an instrument specially developed by the University called Instrumento de Evaluación de Desempeño Laboral (ffiDL) (USB, 1990). The reliability of IEDL was estimated by a test-re-test in consecutive years. The Pearson correlation coefficient for the scores of 519 employees with a complete data set for the period 1990-94 were: 0.505 for 1990-91 comparisons; 0.644 for 1991-92; 0.559 for 1992-93; and 0.565 for 1993-94 comparisons (all significant at p < 0.0001). Each year, employees with the highest scores got a promotion or a salary increase.
Individual occupational performance (OP) was expressed as the total score obtained by the subjects in the IEDL. The total score on IEDL is the sum of the numerical qualifications, equivalent to the qualitative appraisal given by the various supervisors for each factor. The factors were adjusted for each level in order to secure the same maximum total score possible for evaluations at every organizational level, despite the different responsibilities of each level. The factors for Levels 4 and 3 were: planning, organization, coordination, knowledge, liability, initiative, decision making, efficiency, personal relationships, communication, control, advice, capacity to direct (only for Level 4) and assistance (only for Level 3). For Levels 2 and 1, the common factors were: organization of the work, knowledge, liability, presence (punctuality, permanency, assistance), personal relationships, materials and equip-

ment conservation, communication. Level 2 included quantity and quality of production, and attention to the user. Level 1 included efficiency, decision making, initiative, and advice.
The following individual abilities were measured: (1) the facility to mentally construct a three-dimensional figure and to visualize it from different perspectives (Spatial Relationships); and (2) perceptual speed and accuracy of response (Speed and Accuracy). We used the raw score of the Spatial Relationships (SR) and Speed and Accuracy (SA) tests belonging to the Differential Aptitudes Test validated elsewhere (Bennett et al., 1967).
The scores for OP were obtained from the University. The ability tests (SR and SA) were applied according to the specifications in Bennett et al. (1967). The difference between SA and SR scores was calculated by subtracting the raw score of SR from SA (both scores had a maximum potential value of 100).
The data from the total population of employees working in the institution in October 1992 included information about sex, hierarchical level, and occupational performance for each employee (N = 639). Data on scores in spatial relationships and in speed and accuracy were not available, and thus we had to obtain them by testing a sample of 93 individuals. These individuals were chosen using a stratified random sample design. That is, subjects for these tests were chosen randomly but based on a criteria for minimal sample size for each group defined by their level in the organization (at least 10 per cent of the total in that category), range of occupational performance, and sex. The desired sample size for each strata was not always achieved because of resistance by the selected employees, but

no new individuals were included in the sample to help minimize sampling bias.
Statistical analysis was performed using the computer package SPSS and consisted of a stepwise multiple regression, Pearson's correlation, Anova, KruskalWallis (KW) Anova and Student i-test.
RESULTS
The data of occupational efficiency of all administrative and technical personnel of the University showed that the average OP scores were higher at higher organizational levels. This correlation was statistically significant (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.34, p < 0.0001). The data also showed that women had on the average higher scores than males (chi-square = 10.27, p < 0.0014). More women than men were employed in all levels except Level 1. Thus, we designed a stratified sample for this study trying to reach similar numbers of males and females for each level, covering the largest range of OP scores possible.
The data from the sample for which we obtained SA and SR scores is given in Table 1. A stepwise multiple linear regression analysis of the data revealed that 12 per cent of the variance of OP (multiple R = 0.35) can be predicted with hierarchical level (r = 0.211, p = 0.04) and SA (r = 0.209, p = 0.04) with a very high probability (p = 0.004). That is, at higher levels, occupational performance will be better, and performance is related to fine perceptual abilities and perceptual speed and accuracy, but not to spatial abilities. Alternatively, a one-way Anova showed no relation between sex and level or OP, as predicted from the stratified sampling method used, but showed a significant higher OP (F = 6.14, p = 0.01) and SA

score (F = 6.05, p = 0.01) for females, a direct relationship between OP and SA (F = 7.32, p = 0.008), but no relation between OP and SR (p > 0.7).
The data (Table 1) also showed that SA scores of women outperformed those of men in all occupational levels except Level 2 (chi-square = 10.27,p =0.0014). The sex difference between scores in the SA test were statistically significant for Levels 4 and 3 (Student's /-test; t = 3.21,p = 0.003), but not for Levels 2 and 1. Men maintained higher scores in SR than women in all levels except Level 4 (ANOVA: F = 6.09, p < 0.001). Scores of SR test showed significant differences between the hierarchical levels for both sexes (ANOVA: males: df = 3/30, F = 3.21, p = 0.037; females: df = 3/54, F = 8.56, p < 0.0001), though variation of the scores between levels was greater for women. In occupation Level 1, both sexes showed the best scores in SR. The differences between the aptitude scores were always greater for females compared to males. This is consistent with the fact that females scored higher in SA and that SA was better than SR in explaining the positive correlation between hierarchical level, OP, and sex.
However, we must note that the extremely small sample size available for this study limits the possibility of generalizing these results to other populations.
DISCUSSION
The results suggest, as have previous studies, that significant sex differences in psychological abilities exist, as assessed by SR and SA tests. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that, in a functional structure, abilities related to perceptual speed and accuracy are more pronounced in individuals working in higher levels of

the hierarchy and are correlated with better occupational performance. These abilities (and possibly others) are asymmetrically distributed between sexes, explaining, at least partially, why women outperform men in numbers, in position in the hierarchy, and in occupational performance. Spatial abilities, prevalent in males, do not seem to influence the position in the hierarchy in organizations with a functional structure, nor do they affect occupational performance. In occupational levels directly related to technical labor, abilities in establishing spatial relationships are prevalent in both sexes.
The structure of an organization constrains the potential performance of the employees and may affect the performance of individuals differentially by

sex. We predict that in a product structure the performance of individuals should be correlated with abilities in establishing spatial relations, thus favoring males in reaching the upper levels of the hierarchy. Support for this last prediction is difficult to obtain, given that a similar outcome may be expected for any organization operating in a male-dominated environment. We argue that the demonstration of the opposite tendency, i.e., females outperforming males in a functional organization, as shown here, is more worthwhile as it is not predicted by existing theories. In conclusion, we believe that we have presented here an example where basic biological and psycho-physiological characteristics influencing individual behavior affect complex sociocultural expressions.
