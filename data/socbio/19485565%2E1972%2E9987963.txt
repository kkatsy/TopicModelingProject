Abortion is rapidly becoming an important public issue in Canada. Its legal, moral, and political implications are widely debated, and many organizations are pressing for liberalization of old abortion laws. In June, 1969, the Canadian Parliament passed a controversial series of amendments to the Criminal Code of Canada which approved abortions where the mother's health was seriously endangered by the continuation of a pregnancy. Since then, some increase in therapeutic abortions has been observed in certain communities (Boyce and Osborn, 1970). However the impact of the amendments themselves on the incidence has been questioned (Veevers, 1971). Recently, the Royal Commission on the Status of Women recommended strongly that abortions be permitted by a qualified medical practitioner solely on the request of any women who has been pregnant for 12 weeks or less or at the request of a woman pregnant for more than 12 weeks if the doctor is convinced that the continuation of the pregnancy would endanger the physical or mental health of the woman, or if there is a substantial risk that if the child were born, it would be greatly handicapped either mentally or physically (Dominion of

Canada, 1970). In the light of the above recommendations and the general change in social attitudes, further legislation can be expected in the near future.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
It will be especially appropriate to ascertain at this stage the attitudes of women directly affected by these laws. While there have been a limited number of studies in the United States (Rossi, 1967; Kantner and Armstrong, 1968; Westoff, Moore, and Ryder, 1969), they have been practically nonexistent in Canada. In this paper we hope to analyze the responses of a sample of 1,632 married women in metropolitan Toronto to a series of questions on abortion. These women were drawn randomly and were interviewed in early 1968. The questions on abortion were only a few of the many questions asked as part of a broader Canadian Family Growth Study covering many factors associated with fertility and contraception.
Our interest in abortion also arises from its possible demographic impact in the next few years. Countries which have liberalized abortion have all experienced a sudden rapid decline in birth rates. Will the decline

in birth rates in the United States and Canada be accelerated by liberalization of abortion laws? Will abortion be used as a means of birth control, or will it primarily be used as a means of removing accidental pregnancy where a birth control method has failed? In the latter case, what proportion of accidentally pregnant women are likely to seek abortion? These are some of the issues of concern for demographers.
A number of questions were asked about the respondent's approval of abortion under different situations. The distribution of responses to these questions are presented in Table 1.
The responses reveal three patterns. The women overwhelmingly approved abortion if mother's health is endangered, if she is mentally ill or raped, and if there is a question of deformity of the newborn. They were somewhat undecided on situations of severe emotional or economic problems and were generally opposed if the grounds were that serious marriage difficulties might ensue, that the woman was not married, or that a couple simply did not want any more children.
The cumulative distribution of responses

by number of positive responses is given below:
Number of positive responses
O1234S6789
Cumulative per cent distribution 100 92 87 80 72 61 48 36 26 IS
The above figures indicate that 92% approved abortion at least for any one reason, 87% at least for any two reasons, and so on, with 15% approving abortion for all reasons.
Since an abortion is now legally permitted in Canada only when the mother's health is in danger, the above distribution indicates that 87% are probably for liberalizing the present law.1 The general level of attitudes of the sample women can be said to lie somewhere between those of the Roman-Catholic-affiliated organizations opposed to reform of present laws and those of Unitarian and Jewish orga-
1 No question was asked about changing the present Canadian law. The figure of 87% was derived from the respondents supporting more than one indication for abortion not permitted by law at the time. Because of the lack of acceptable scaleability of the attitude index, the response patterns do not provide a precise indication of which items have been accepted or rejected.

nizations advocating a very liberal position toward abortion.
A reminder that attitudes are only a guide to behavior came in the results of responses to the following question:
If you should accidentally become pregnant and already had all the children you want, do you think you might consider having an abortion to terminate the pregnancy if abortion for this reason were legal in Canada?
Only 18% responded in the affirmative; yet 28% had approved abortion in this instance in principle as evident in Table 1. The difference in percentage support of a certain action in contrast to expressed readiness to participate in that action was 35% and 22% for non-Catholics and 13% and 7% for Catholics. This apparent inconsistency between attitude toward abortion and action suggests the presence of stronger intervening attitudes or values. These countervailing forces might include attitudes and loyalty to one's own church teachings or a fear of the operation itself.
An index measuring the attitude toward liberalizing abortion was developed using the responses to the nine questions in Table 1. This index is the sum of the positive responses and thus can vary from 0 to 9 for any respondent. The mean of this index for all women was 5.19 with a standard deviation of 2.78. Construction of the index by simple addition implies equal weight for all the questions. The larger the index for a respondent, the more liberal is her attitude toward abortion.
RESULTS
FERTILITY BEHAVIOR, FAMILY PLANNING PRACTICES AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS ABORTION
The few studies on attitudes towards abortion conducted in North America all show that attitudes toward abortion are closely related to a person's religious beliefs and levels of education, income, etc.

(see, for example, Westoff et al., 1969, p. 14-16). But how far they are a function of a woman's situational factors--such as the number of children desired or expected, accidental pregnancy history, and contraceptive practice--are less often explored. However, Westoff et al. (1969, p. 25) did find in their 1965 national sample of United States women an inverse relation between number of children expected and liberal attitudes toward abortion.
We shall first examine the influence of situational fertility factors on the attitudes toward abortion. The mean abortion index by religion and family-size variables are presented in Table 2. The general pattern is toward a less liberal attitude towards abortion as family size increases. Both for Catholics and non-Catholics there is an inverse relation between number of children and liberal attitudes toward abortion after two children. However, women with no children or one child are less liberal. It is possible that these women are mostly either young women just starting their families or have problems of sterility or subfecundity, and in either case are not immediately concerned with controlling their family size.
It was hypothesized that women who had failures in planning their families might well be influenced in their attitudes toward abortion by this fact. Thus, those women who had accidental pregnancies resulting in either unwanted children or children at an unwanted time might be more likely to show their frustration by a more liberal attitude toward abortion. To test this hypothesis, all the women in the sample were classified according to whether their last pregnancy was unwanted in terms of number and spacing. The results are presented in Table 3. Both among Catholics and nonCatholics, those women whose last pregnancy was unwanted were more liberal toward abortion. Spacing failure does not seem to affect responses as much as number

failure. Thirty-three per cent of the women whose last pregnancy was unwanted said that they would obtain an abortion next time they become pregnant, if it were legally available, as against 14% of women who had not had an accidental pregnancy. Thus, past success or failure in family planning seems to influence attitudes toward abortion.
A related question of import is the relationship between contraceptive practice and

attitudes toward abortion. Westoff et al. (1969) found that women who were in favor of family limitation were more liberal toward abortion. In our data an analysis was made to investigate the relation between current contraceptive practice and attitudes toward abortion. The results are shown in Table 4. The most liberal women were those whose fertility was controlled by mechanical methods of condom and diaphragm. The mean abortion index for

Catholic women in this category was 5.37 and for non-Catholics 6.26. These women were followed by women on pills and the IUCD, on chemicals and other methods, and the rhythm method, in that order. For women using the rhythm method, the mean

values were only 2.58 for Catholics and 5.11 for non-Catholics. Women who were not using any method, though at risk of pregnancy, were less liberal than those using a method. The finding that the effectiveness of the method used is related to

attitudes toward abortion is not surprising. Women who are on more effective methods are evidently morp concerned about control of family size; they are also less religious, are more likely to have higher education and income, and are generally more liberal in their outlook, as shown in Table S.
SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS ABORTION
The above-considered variables of family size and family planning are at best intervening variables which are a result of a woman's socioeconomic background, religious beliefs, and values and norms developed in her particular social milieu. The relationship between many of these variables to her attitudes toward abortion are investigated here. Our data show the most important factor is religious affiliation (Table 5). The mean abortion index for Catholics was 3.36 compared to 5.97 for Protestants and 6.89 for Jews. The next most important factor was religiosity as measured by church attendance. Women who never attended church had a mean abortion index of 6.02 compared to 3.57 for those who attended church five or more times a month. Education and income were both directly related to liberal attitudes toward abortion. Since education and income are highly correlated, this consistency is to be expected. Wife's rural-urban background as measured by the size of her birthplace was also directly related to attitudes toward abortion. The larger the population of the birthplace, the more liberal were the attitudes.
MULTIPLE CLASSIFICATION ANALYSIS OF ATTITUDES TOWARDS ABORTION
As many fertility and socioeconomic variables are interrelated, it is difficult to assess their relative importance without appropriate multivariate analysis. Two statistical measures for each category of each independent variable are shown in Table 6. "Unadjusted" deviations are the deviations

of category "Mean Abortion Index" from "Mean Abortion Index for All Women." "Adjusted" deviations are these categoryspecific deviations after the effects of other independent variables are taken into account.
Religion seems to be the most powerful indicator. Adjusting for religiosity and adjusting for all the other eight predictors does not alter the pattern. Religiosity as measured by church attendance is also found to be equally important after controlling for the other independent variables. The greater the religiosity, the less liberal the attitudes toward abortion. The direct relation between education and attitudes toward abortion persists even after controlling for other predictors, but the strength of the relation is much weaker. There is very little difference between the educational categories, especially after 9 years of schooling. The same is true for the rural-urban background of the wife. However, the relationship of husband's income to attitudes toward abortion still remains strong after control for the other predictors.
For age and desired family size, the adjusted deviations are lower in magnitude than unadjusted deviations, but the patterns are essentially the same. Why younger women are less liberal than older women is a somewhat perplexing question and requires further investigation.
When controlled for other predictors, the relationship of current contraceptive use to attitudes toward abortion loses much of its significance. Only women using mechanical methods of condom and diaphragm or rhythm vary significantly from the overall norm. Women who had an unwanted pregnancy in terms of number still seem to be slightly more liberal than other women.
SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
The preceding analysis suggests that socioeconomic characteristics are much

more important in shaping a woman's attitudes toward abortion than situational variables such as accidental pregnancy history, contraceptive practice, or desired or expected number of children. Among the socioeconomic variables, religion and religiosity are predominant. Our study seems to indicate that more than any other factor a decline in religious values and beliefs would contribute to liberalized attitudes toward abortion.
The combined effects of thepredictors on the attitudes toward abortion are presented in Table 7. The three situational variables of desired family size, current contraceptive practice, and last pregnancy status explain only 10% of the variance in the abortion index. When only the two predictors of religion and religiosity are used, the vari-

ance explained was 23%. When as many as nine predictors are used, 3 1 % of the variation is explained.2 The beta coefficients indicate the relative importance of the different predictors. The fact that in spite of using as many as nine independent variables, we are able to explain only about one-third of the variance in the abortion index suggests the complex nature of attitude formation on such a sensitive issue as abortion.
