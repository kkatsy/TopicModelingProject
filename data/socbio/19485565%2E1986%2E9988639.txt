ABSTRACT: There is ample evidence that there are important behavioral differences in Latin America between couples living in consensual unions and those who are legally married. In this paper, we examine the frequency of and variations in legalization of consensual unions in Mexico, using data from the 1976-77 Encuesta Mexicana de Fecundidad. Our results indicate that the frequency of legalization of consensual unions appears to have risen among recent cohorts. Women in first unions, those who start a union at older ages, and those who are more highly educated are also more likely to marry their partners. Our results also indicate that pregnancy does not appear to be a major factor precipitating legalization, and that whether a couple lived together before marriage has no effect on the stability of the marriage.

In Mexico, as elsewhere in Latin America, socially sanctioned conjugal unions take several different forms. The two primary forms are: marriages and consensual unions. Roughly 12 per cent of all women in unions at the time of the Mexican Fertility Survey were in consensual unions, but a substantially larger proportion had lived in a consensual union at some time in their lives (Quilodran, 1982). There is ample evidence that there are important behavioral differences between couples living in each type of union, including a significantly higher probability of separation for those in consensual unions (Potter and Ojeda, 1982). Thus, in studies of nuptiality and fertility patterns, it is often important to distinguish between unions of different types. The distinction between consensual unions and marriages, however, is complicated by the fact that many couples in consensual unions eventually marry their partners in a civil and/or religious ceremony. Unfortu-

nately, relatively little is known about this process, which we will refer to as legalization,1 or about which couples are most likely to legalize.
In this paper, our goal is to examine legalization in Mexico using data from the Encuesta Mexicana de Fecundidad (EMF) conducted in 1976-77 in connection with the World Fertility Survey. This analysis is an extension of an earlier study (described below) of legalization in Latin America, based on data from a set of surveys taken in rural and semiurban areas in 1969-70 as part of CELADE's program of comparative fertility surveys in Latin America
1The term "legalization" is used to indicate the transition from cohabitation to marriage, either by a civil or religious marriage or both. The vast majority of such marriages are either civil or a combination of civil and religious. Only 5 per cent of ongoing unions at the time of the EMF interview were religious only. Quilodrán (1982) indicates that "marriage 'only by the church' is less and less common, and currently persists only in the most rural localities."

(PECFAL). Our primary objective is to describe legalization in Mexico as part of the Mexican nuptiality pattern. We examine the characteristics of women initially entering consensual unions and legal marriages, the frequency and timing of legalization of consensual unions and its relationship to fertility, and the resulting stability of legalized unions relative to legal marriages without prior cohabitation.2 Our results are also compared with those from the earlier Mexican PECFAL survey as a check on their validity.
PREVIOUS RESEARCH
The study of legalization of consensual unions in Latin America has been hampered by a paucity of data. By definition, consensual unions are not registered in vital registration systems, and they are often underreported in censuses (Camisa, 1978; Florez and Goldman, 1980; Ordorica and Potter, 1980; Quilodran, 1982). Mortara (1964) points out that only consensual unions which "have a certain character or permanence" are usually recorded, that women are more apt to report the existence of these unions than are men, and that certain respondents are likely to report that they are legally married rather than admit that they are in an informal union. Analysis of legalizations is fur-
2Legalization of consensual unions is not the only kind of union transition with the same partner. A complete analysis of this topic might also include an examination of what we might call sanctification of marriages, that is, the change from a civil to a religiously sanctioned marriage through a second wedding ceremony performed by a priest some time after the civil marriage. Unfortunately, neither EMF data nor those from the earlier PECFAL surveys permit us to determine whether a marriage reported retrospectively as both civil and religious had been initiated as such, or whether the religious rites came after the civil ceremony.

ther complicated by the failure of most vital registration systems and censuses to distinguish between legal marriages with and without prior cohabitation. The exceptions are Panama in 1967 and Guatemala in 1957, for which data from vital registration indicate that about 30 per cent and 15per cent, respectively, of first Jegal marriages were preceded by cohabitation with the same partner (Camisa, 1978).
Of the series of fertility surveys in Latin America over the past twenty years, only two have included a full union history: the PECFAL rural surveys conducted in several countries in 1969 and 1970 and the National Fertility Surveys conducted since 1975 in connection with the World Fertility Survey. The PECFAL surveys attempted to collect a broad range of detailed fertility and nuptiality information. In the nuptiality history, all changes in union type were recorded as separate unions and legalization is one of the possible types of union termination. The 1976 Encuesta Mexicana de Fecundidad employed a similar but more detailed format for its union history. By contrast, the other Latin American surveys in the WFS series used an altered version of the standard WFS questionnaire, which fails to determine whether a woman had more than one type of union with the same partner. That is, termination of a consensual union and the beginning of a legal marriage with the same partner were recorded as only one union. This unfortunate limitation of the WFS questionnaire not only makes the study of legalization impossible in all countries except Mexico, but it confounds analysis cf union dissolution to an unknown extent (Goldman, 1981).

nlent table. In the double decrement life table, we consider two categories of events which can terminate a consensual union: (1) legalization; (2) all other terminations, i.e., separation or death of one partner. Although the event of interest is legalization, the frequency of other types of terminations can affect the per cent of consensual unions which actually legalize; that is, if most consensual unions end in a separation, few can end in a legalization. By contrast, in the single decrement life table, the only recorded termination is legalization, and separation and death of a partner are treated as censorings. Consensual unions which dissolve by the latter causes contribute exposure to the risk of legalization up until the time of the separation or death. Hence, the single decrement life table probabilities are hypothetical in that they refer to the per cent of consensual unions which would legalize by successive durations, if they did not terminate by other causes.
We initially consider both single and double decrement probabilities for the entire sample Of consensual unions (Table 2), but use only single decrement values for comparisons among subgroups.4 By eliminating all competing risks, single decrement tables provide a standardized comparison of the risks of legalization among different groups of
4Calculation of single decrement rates, however, requires the assumption that the two events of interest occur independent of one another. In the case of legalization and separation, this assumption may not be valid. Unfortunately, as discussed in the text, the use of double decrement legalization rates, which are not comparable across subgroups because of differing separation rates, is equally unappealing. Faced with two alternatives, neither of which is ideal, we have chosen to present single decrement rates to facilitate interpretation of our results. In any event, the direction of the results remains the same for both single and double decrement rates.

women. Since the sample size in each interval of our life tables is relatively small, we present cumulative probabilities of legalization by duration of union, for most of our calculations.
DATA
The data used in this analysis come from the 1976-77 Encuesta Mexicana de Fecundidad (EMF). The EMF sample was self-weighting and consisted of 13,080 households intended to represent the national population. As in other WFS surveys, brief questionnaires were completed for households, and eligible women in each household were then interviewed with a detailed individual questionnaire. Women were eligible for interview if they were 20 to 49 years old, or if they were 15 to 19 and had ever been married or had a child (EMF First Country Report, 1979, Vol. 1, p. 51), The data used here are entirely from individual interviews of a total of 7,310 women, principally from the union and birth histories. In the union history, women were asked to supply the year and month of the onset of each union, type of union (civil, religious, or consensual), year and month of dissolution (if applicable), and reason for dissolution (including whether or not the union was legalized). The reproductive history in EMF collected the following data for each pregnancy: the date it ended, the type of outcome (live birth, stillbirth, etc.) and gestation at the time of outcome for nonlive births.
Ordorica and Potter (1980) evaluated the quality of data collected in the EMF, using both internal consistency checks and comparisons with other sources of data..In general, they concluded that "the survey gives every indication of having been carried out with care and

the results seem, by and large, to be as free from response error as one could reasonably hope for" (p. 28). More specifically, their results indicate that "the EMF nuptiality data appear to be significantly less affected by response error than the results of other surveys in the WFS series that have been conducted in countries at a similar level of economic development, although there is some evidence for oldest cohorts of misplacement of births" (p. 28).
COMPARISON OF
EMF AND PECFAL DATA
Both to check further on data quality and to facilitate subsequent comparison of results between the two surveys, we compared nuptiality and fertility from the EMF and PECFAL Mexican surveys for the period of time and the portion of the population which they both cover. Tabulations from the EMF were made comparable to those from PECFAL by including only events prior to January 1, 1970 (roughly the midpoint of the PECFAL interviews) and by tabulating age for women interviewed in EMF as of this date. Women younger than 22 in the EMF and women 43 or older in PECFAL were removed from the analysis. Women younger than 22 at the time of the EMF would not have met the minimum PECFAL age criteria of 15 in 1970. Similarly, women 43 or older as of PECFAL would be 50 or older by the time of EMF. The result is that calculations as of January, 1970, are based on women aged 15-42, for estimates derived from either the EMF or PECFAL.
The total pre-1970 EMF sample, however, is still not strictly comparable to the PECFAL sample, because all PECFAL respondents had to live in areas containing fewer than 20,000 inhab-

itants, according to the criteria for eligibility. It is difficult to determine how to select an EMF subsample which would be comparable as far as the PECFAL rural residence requirement. Since the EMF collected a migration history for each respondent, it would be theoretically possible to confine EMF tabulations to only those women who in 1970 lived in places with fewer than 20,000 inhabitants. However, the necessary data were not coded onto the data tape. We have chosen a simpler, although less satisfactory, approach. We compare PECFAL respondents with two groups: the total EMF sample, and the sample of women who lived in locations with a population under 20,000 at the time of the EMF survey. There are two reasons why this second sample would not be comparable to the PECFAL rural sample: migration between 1969 and 1976, which has been primarily from rural to urban areas, and growth in the size of places from under 20,000 to over 20,000. These limitations should be borne in mind when interpreting subsequent comparisons between the two surveys.
Initial comparisons of the age distributions, proportions of first unions which are consensual, proportion of women currently in a union, and mean number of children ever born for respondents in the two surveys (as of January, 1970) indicated general agreement between the two data sources. In most cases, the PECFAL results fall somewhere between the total EMF and the rural EMF results, as we might expect from recent migration patterns and the growth of rural areas. The results described in the next section compare estimates of the prevalence of consensual unions and the frequency of legalization of such unions, as derived from the two surveys.

RESULTS
PREVALENCE OF CONSENSUAL UNIONS
Since the focus of this analysis is on probabilities of legalizing consensual unions, most of our calculations are restricted to women's consensual unions. Before examining the frequency of legalization, however, we briefly consider the prevalence of consensual unions in the EMF sample. Table 1shows the per cent of unions recorded in the EMF nuptiality history which are consensual by various characteristics of respondents. Overall, 28 per cent of all conjugal unions are consensual. First unions, which comprise the majority of all unions, are more often consensual in rural than in urban areas. For second and higher order unions, consensual unions are slightly more common in urban areas. Overall, the frequency of consensual unions is greater among higher-

order unions, although in rural areas, the proportion consensual is about the same regardless of union order.
The proportion of unions which are consensual is 31.7 for the PECFAL sample, which is very close to the 31.2 per cent for rural EMF. The PECFAL and rural EMF figures for first unions also agr"ee well. However, while 41.9 per cent of PECFAL higher order unions are consensual, the comparable figures for the rural EMF sample is only 30 per cent.
The second part of Table 1 indicates that a women's first union is more likely to be consensual if she was younger at interview, had an earlier age at union, and had little or no education. These last two results are consistent with the findings of previous analyses that women enter consensual unions at younger ages than they enter legal marriages and that women in informal unions tend to be

from lower social strata (Yaukey and Thorsen, 1972; Michielutte et al., 1973). The proportion of unions which are consensual in the rural EMF sample by age at interview, age at union, and education are also quite similar to those from the Mexico PECFAL survey (Goldman and Pebley, 1981).
FREQUENCY OFLEGALIZATION
While consensual unions account for more than a quarter of all unions in Mexico and are often viewed as an ac-

ceptable alternative to civil or religious marriage, the figures in Table 2 suggest that consensual unions are frequently converted to legal marriages. Roughly half of all consensual unions recorded in the EMF become marriages by 25 years duration. Few consensual unions remain intact beyond that point, due to the combined effects of legalization, separation, and widowhood. The frequency of legalization, as indicated by double decrement values, is virtually identical in urban and rural areas. How-

A comparison of the EMF and PECFAL union histories suggests that part of the reason for the differences in legalization rates observed may result from different questionnaire design. In the EMF questionnaire, respondents were asked for each marriage, the date the marriage began, whether the marriage was preceded by cohabitation with the same partner, and if it was, when she began to live with that partner. In addition, the tabular format in which previous unions were recorded makes it explicit that each union (whether or not with the same individual) was to be recorded separately, and that legalization is an appropriate type of union termination.
Although the intent was the same in the PECFAL questionnaire, the questions are organized in a more confusing manner. For each marriage, respondents are asked whether they lived with the same partner prior to marriage. Regardless of the reply, they are then asked "in what year and month were you married (did you begin living together)?" It is left up to the interviewer to record a consensual union preceding a marriage as a separate union with a separate starting date. This sequence of questions may also have created some confusion among respondents about whether to give the date of marriage (legalization) or the date when they began cohabitation. Furthermore, all respondents terminating a union were asked: "How did this marriage (consensual union) end: death, separation or divorce?". Note that "marrying a partner" is not explicitly included in the question, although it is one of the response codes on the questionnaire. A skillful interviewer who understood the respondent's history could have properly coded the questionnaire. However,

the sequence and wording of questions in PECFAL leaves much more room for confusion and miscoding than the EMF questionnaire.
These differences in questionnaire design between the two surveys may have meant that (1) consensual unions which legalized at short durations were less likely to be recorded in the PECFAL -survey than consensual unions which were intact at interview or resulted in separation, and (2) even if the consensual union was recorded, the PECFAL questionnaire may have miscoded the legalization as another type of termination. Some support for this latter hypothesis can be seen from Table 4: The probabilities of separation and widowhood are higher for the PECFAL sample than for the comparable EMF sample. Since most of the differences occur in the first year of union, these data suggest that the legalizations of brief unions may have been mistakenly recorded as separations. Given the more careful and less ambiguous design and the more frequent probing of important points in the EMF union history relative to the PECFAL questionnaire, the EMF estimates of legalization would appear more credible than those from PECFAL.
VARIATIONS IN THE
PROBABILITY OF LEGALIZATION
As Table 5 shows, the probability of legalization differs substantially between first-order unions and secondand higher-order unions for EMF respondents. By ten years after the beginning of the union, only 19 per cent of higher-order unions have legalized compared with 46 per cent of first unions. These results suggest that women with more than one union may prefer cohabitation to marriage, that men may be less

likely to marry women who have had several previous partners and perhaps have children, or that many higherorder consensual unions may involve previously married women who cannot remarry because they were never formally divorced. Because of the large differences in the frequency of legalization by order of union and the relatively small numbers of higher-order unions,

we restrict the remainder of the analysis to first consensual unions.
Although the results in Table 1 indicate that women who are in older cohorts, who were older at first union, and who are better educated are more likely to have a legal marriage as their first union, we have yet to determine whether these same characteristics increase the probability of legalization for women who initially enter a consensual union. In Table 6, we present the probabilities of legalization by selected durations of union, according to a woman's age at interview, age at beginning of first union, and educational attainment. In our earlier work with the PECFAL survey, we found that if a woman was an observant Catholic she was much more likely to legalize her consensual union in Mexico (Goldman and Pebley, 1981). Unfortunately, information on religion is not available from the EMF.
The results in Table 6 suggest that legalization is more common among

there are two selection processes in operation. As several researchers have suggested, couples who believe they have more stable relationships may initially enter legal marriages, foregoing the trial period provided by a consensual union; among those who do initially opt for a trial period, only more stable unions progress to legalization (Quilodrdn, 1980; Potter and Ojeda, 1982). Thus, legal marriages appear to be equally stable regardless of the process by which they are reached.
DISCUSSION
In this paper we have examined the frequency of and variations in legalization of consensual unions in Mexico, using data from the 1976-77 Encuesta Mexicana de Fecundidad. Our results indicate that while consensual unions are fairly common among Mexican women, many are subsequently legalized. Approximately 30 per cent of first consensual unions are legalized by five years after the union was formed. The vast majority (84per cent) of consensual unions dissolve by 25 years duration either through legalization or due to separation and widowhood. The frequency of legalization is similar in both urban and rural areas, even though consensual unions are more common in rural areas. First consensual unions are much more likely to be legalized than those of higher order. Women in more recent co-

horts, who start a union at older ages, and who are more educated, are more likely to marry their partners.
There has been some speculation that pregnancy may be an important factor precipitating the legalization of a consensual union. Our earlier analysis of the 1969 PECFAL survey data from rural areas in four Latin American countries, including Mexico, indicated that there was no difference in the probability of legalization between unions in which a pregnancy occurred and those without a pregnancy. By and large, the results from our analysis of the EMF data support this result. However, for unions begun subsequent to 1965, there appears to be a moderate difference after the first few years of union.
Finally, we looked at whether marriages resulting from legalizations are more stable than first marriages for couples who had not cohabited prior to marriage. Our results indicate that there is no difference in the probability of separation between the two groups. These findings are in contrast to earlier results from the PECFAL survey which indicated that cohabitation exerted a stabilizing effect on marriage.
