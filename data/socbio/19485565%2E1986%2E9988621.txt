ABSTRACT:A model of fertility determination is presented in which current fertility is a nonlinear function of the fertility of previous generations. This model seems to be an adequate representation of post-war fertility in Canada and forecasts a renewal of fertility in the 1980's and 1990's. It would seem that policy decisions based on the unchallenged assumption of a continuance of low fertility may be ill-advised.

The post-war decline in Canadian fertility--from a total fertility rate of 3.947 in 1959 to 1.704 in 1981--has been well documented (Henripin and Legare, 1971; Murphy and Nagnur, 1972; Legare, 1974; Grindstaff, 1975; Collinshaw, 1976; Statistics Canada, 1979). The decline is generally attributed to two main factors: (1) the spread and increasing effectiveness of contraception; and (2) the fundamental change in women's role in society. But whatever the reasons for the decline in fertility, it is a commonly held belief that the trend will continue (Grindstaff, 1975; LaVoie, 1979; Statistics Canada, 1979). LaVoie concludes that it is "now increasingly obvious that migration may replace natural increase as the most important factor in determining future population growth."
But is it perfectly clear that current economic and social developments will persist and fertility will, of necessity, continue to decline? It is not.
Several years ago Richard Easterlin (1961,1968,1973) developed a model of fertility based on the correspondence between movements in the age structure of the labor force and the fertility rate.

As the ratio of younger to older workers falls, the former perform better in the labor market than expected and their income rises relative to that which they expected. Members of a relatively smaller cohort marry earlier, in greater numbers, and have higher fertility rates than would larger cohorts, for whom the labor market experience is worse than their expectations. Easterlin and Condran (1976) applied the model to Canada and found a "rough correspondence between the movement in the age ratio and the fertility rate," although, compared to the U.S. and Australia, "the amplitude of the fertility movement is greater, with the fertility down turn especially being more pronounced." They concluded that "if this mechanism really is operative, then it implies a continuation of the current fertility decline through 1980. At that point, the fertility decline in progress since 1960 would start to have its effect on the age ratio and presumably set in motion a replication of the 1940-1980 pattern."
Thus, Easterlin and Condran suggest the possibility that Canadian fertility is dictated by a relative cohort size (or relative income) model of fertility which

points to a resurgence of fertility in the next two decades rather than a decline. Samuelson (1976) has recently formalized Easterlin's model and shown that if the Easterlin effect is sufficiently strong, cycles in fertility will result.1 Ahlburg (1983) demonstrated that this model fits the U.S. post-war fertility data very well and predicts the revival of fertility in the 1980's and 1990's. This model will now be applied to Canadian data as a check on Easterlin and Condran's earlier analysis and to see whether the model also predicts a revival of Canadian fertility.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The basic elements of the model are as follows. Increases in the size of a birth cohort relative to preceding cohorts reduce that cohort's income relative to that of smaller cohorts and consequently reduce the fertility of the large cohort. In this manner, the size of a particular cohort is a function of the size of previous birth cohorts.
This system can formally be shown to reduce to (see Samuelson, 1976, and Ahlburg, 1983)

However, immigration has been an important, though highly variable, source of population growth in Canada. It contributed 5,25, and 22 per cent of population growth in 1941-51, 1951-61 and 1961-71, respectively. Over the most recent period, 1971-76, it contributed about one-third of population growth (Denton et al., 1980.) However, emigration has also been significant in Canada; net emigration rates were 0.9,6.7, and 3.6 per thousand in 1941-51,195161, and 1961-71. For both emigration and immigration, about 25 per cent were females in the prime childbearing years 20-39 (Denton et al., 1980).
From these statistics, it does not appear that immigration or emigration was sufficiently large to alter significantly the age-structure of the population. In addition, foreign-born women have much lower fertility than native-born women, particularly among post-war immigrants (Collishaw, 1976; Balakrishnan et al., 1979). Consequently, the model outlined above may be a useful approximation to the Canadian experience.

period 1941-79. The error term was found to be serially correlated and so the equation was estimated using the Beach-McKinnon (1978) maximum likelihood technique. The results are consistent with the relative cohort size model outlined above. The variables were correctly signed and significant at the 0.05 level in one-tailed tests. The overall equation is significant at the 0.01 level.
As may be seen from accuracy statistics reported in Table 1, the relative cohort model is a good representation of the variation in post-war total live births. The mean absolute error is about 11,000 births, or less than 3 per cent of mean births. The model is superior to an

assumption of constancy of births (the Theil statistic is less than one), and most of the error is in the disturbance proportion, that is, it is random.
It has been argued above that immigration is unlikely to invalidate the model. This assumption was checked by adding a variable which measured the total number of married female immigrants aged 15-39 years lagged one year to Equation (2). As may be seen in Table 1, this assumption was supported. The immigration variable had a t value of less than one and did not alter the estimated parameters or accuracy statistics of the model.
Although the model is specified to have generational lags of twenty years,

54

and empirical findings cited support these lags, is the model sensitive to this specific lag structure? An alternative lag structure of 25 and 50 years has been suggested as being closer to the model childbearing age. The result of estimating the model with this lag structure over the shorter period 1951-79 is shown in Table 1. The pattern of signs on the coefficients remains unchanged, but the second term of the model is no longer significant. However, the fit of the model, as shown by the accuracy statistics, is quite similar. For example, the mean absolute error is 1,300 births less. The model seems quite robust with regard to this change in the lag structure.
LaVoie (1979) claimed that "this [Easterlin's relative cohort size] theory only accounts very roughly for changes in fertility in Canada and consequently is not an effective tool for making fertility projections."2 The results reported above challenge the first of these statements. The second is, in part, an empirical matter to which we now turn.
THE FORECASTS
Forecasts based on Equation (2) are presented in Table 2 along with three sets of forecasts from Denton et al. (1980). Their low, medium, and high forecasts assume terminal (2051) crude birth rates of 8.2,13.3, and 20.9 and to-
2LaVoie further argues that "it isdifficult to believe, given the changing social context (especially views on therole of women in society), that the relationship defined by Easterlin will hold true for the next two decades." However, it is not clear that societal changes are as fundamental as some commentators have argued nor isit clear that they are not endogenous (see Easterlin, 1980, for a full discussion of these issues).Thestability ofthe relationship is an empirical question and cannot, and should not,be decided on the basis of beliefs inthe extent of societal change.

tal fertility rates of 1.5,2.1, and 3.0, respectively. These bracket the two official forecasts of Statistics Canada which assume total fertility rates of 1.7 and 2.1 (LaVoie, 1979). In contrast to the present approach, both Denton et al. and Statistics Canada derive forecasts of total live births by applying fertility rates to the female population of childbearing age. Denton et al. uses a Gompertz function based on assumed future values of total lifetime fertility, median age of mothers at childbirth, and the interquantile ranges of their ages at childbirth to project the age distribution of fertility rates.
Although our main interest is to see what direction the relative cohort model predicts for fertility, it is also of interest to see how accurate are its point estimates. For 1980-82 the MAE's are 23,000 and 17,000 births or mean absolute percentage error of 6.2 and 4.6 per cent for the models with 20 and 25 year lags respectively. The MAPE's for the former decrease markedly over this period while those for the latter increase. This is a respectable level of accuracy for a variable which is traditionally difficult to forecast. The model may, therefore, be a useful complement to the models currently used to forecast births.
The forecast with 20-year lags from the relative cohort model lie between the low and medium forecasts of Denton et al. until the end of this decade and between the medium and high forecast for the remainder of the century. The model based on 25-year generational lags predicts 20 per cent fewer births in the year 2000 than does the basic model, although it does predict births to rise significantly relative to the levels of the early 1960's. This difference reflects the slower development of cycles in this
