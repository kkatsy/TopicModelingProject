ABSTRACT:A general multifactorial model is given for the inheritance of traits that exhibit a sexual dimorphism. The model allows for polygenic inheritance, cultural transmission, phenotypic assortative mating, and a common environment of rearing. Several cultural mechanisms are described for which transmission from parent to offspring is sex-dependent and for which many different patterns of sex-specific correlations can result. A special case of the general model is described in which phenotypic differences between males and females are due only to differences in nontransmissible environmental factors and/or genetic factors that do not contribute to variability within a sex. Application of these models to human spatial visualizing ability, using data reported by others, gives an estimate of 45 per cent for the proportion of the variance that is accounted for by transmissible factors. Neither an X-linked hypothesis nor a sex-specific cultural mechanism is required to explain the transmission of spatial ability.

The traditional multifactorial model for the inheritance of a quantitative trait, as proposed by Fisher (1918), requires the assumption that phenotypic similarity between relatives is due solely to genetic factors. This model has only recently been extended to incorporate the contribution of nonrandom environmental sources of variation to familial resemblance. Current formulations of the multifactorial model allow for direct parent-to-offspring transmission of environmental factors (cultural inheritance) as well as for correlated nontransmissible environments of individuals reared together.
The traditional model assumes that a phenotype, P, may be partitioned as P = A +D + E, where A denotes the additive effect of many loci, D the dominance effect, and E random environmental effects on the phenotype. The covariances COV (A,D), COV (A,E), and COV (£>,£) be-

tween the components are assumed to be 0. The parameters of the model can be estimated from the parent-offspring and sibling correlations since rpo = Vih2 and roo = Vih2 + Vtd1, with h = crAI crP and d = aD / o>, where cr denotes the standard deviation of the indicated variable. The presence of cultural transmission will, however, lead to an inflated estimate of d.
For behavioral or developmental phenotypes, comprehensive models are needed which do not exclude a priori either genetic or cultural transmission. Such models can then provide a framework for integrating sociocultural and biological indices with models of family resemblance. Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman (Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, 1973a,6; Feldman and Cavalli-Sforza, 1975, 1977) have pioneered the.development of general models that include various types of non-Mendelian transmission. They note that cultural inheritance may be mediated either by social learning and modeling or by parents directly teaching their offspring certain customs and prefer-

ences. They emphasize the plasticity of genotypes in response to their environments and deal explicitly with the effect of phenotype-to-phenotype transmission. Morton (1974) and Rao et al. (1974,1976) have developed a general linear model of familial resemblance using path analytic techniques to incorporate both an index of home environment and cultural transmission. They describe the effects of secondary assortative mating due to social homogamy and have recently included direct phenotypic assortment (Rao et al., 1979).
Rice et al. (1978, 1980) and Cloninger et al. (1979a,6) have described two models which allow for combined polygenic and cultural transmission, primary or secondary phenotypic assortative mating, correlated environments of rearing, and variable family structure. The BETA Model (Cloninger et al., 1979a,6) is appropriate when separation data are available and explicitly contains as parameters both h2, the (narrow) heritability, and b2, the proportion of the phenotypic variance due to cultural transmission. This model has recently been used by Rice et al. (1980) in their analysis of IQ and SES (socioeconomic status) data. The TAU Model (Rice et al., 1978, 1980) is appropriate when data are available only for individuals who are reared in intact nuclear families. The model assumes that a phenotype P may be partitioned as P = T + E, where T denotes both genetic and cultural factors which are transmissible from parent to offspring and E denotes all other effects with COV (T,E) = 0. Familial resemblance is determined by the following two structural equations given in terms of standardized variables:

P = tT + eE,

To =

rR,

(1) (2)

coefficients (standardized partial regression coefficients) t and e are given by o>/ o> and aE /CTP,respectively, so that f + e2 = 1. The path coefficients i> and TM measure the relative contribution to the offspring's phenotype made by each parent, and R, with path coefficient r, is the residual term of the regression equation which is assumed uncorrelated with TM and TF. In the case of polygenic inheritance, TM and TFwould be one-half and R would be segregation from midparent genotype. The TAU model also allows for a correlation between the phenotypes of mates and a correlation between the E's of individuals reared together.
In this paper we shall extend the TAU Model to allow for the distributions of both T and E to differ for males and females as well as to allow for the T'S to depend both upon the sex of the parent and the sex of the offspring. This model, termed the TAU Model With Sex Effect, allows for differences in the means of males and females as well as for sex differences in correlations. Using this model, we demonstrate that cultural inheritance can lead to many different sex-dependent patterns of familial correlations. In contrast, such patterns may be difficult to explain when only genetic transmission is considered.

By setting all the Tf/'s equal to T in Equations (9) through (15), we obtain the following two relationships among the phenotypic correlations:

where O, F, M, denote the offspring, father and mother, respectively. The difference in the phenotypic distributions of males and females is due only to the effects of nontransmissible factors or biological factors that do not show variability within a sex. If the variance of £, and E2 are equal, but a^ctj, as in the case of systematic cultural or biological differences discussed previously, then males and females will have the same variance and only differ in their means, so that all parent-offspring correlations will be equal. If, however, £,' and E2' have different variances, then the variances of P,' and P2' will differ, and the path coefficients r, and t2 will be unequal, even though the phenotypes differ only for environmental reasons. In such a model, the standardized path equations might mislead an investigator (Duncan, 1975). Indeed, all sex differences could be explained by the two phenotypes differing only in their reliability of measurement.
Note, however, that the standard polygenic model is a special case of the Environmental Model, so that a fit to this model does not imply the presence of cultural transmission. "Environmental" here only refers to the implication that iff, + t2, then this difference is explained by differences in nontransmissible factors. Moreover, even iff, = t2, it is possible that the means of males and females are the same, so that a fit to the Environmental Model does not imply an environmental

If observations satisfy these two equations, and there is a reduced variance for the sex with the higher same-sex correlation, then the Environmental Model should be considered as a likely explanation of the data. If m is zero, and all c,7's are zero, then

so that the phenotypic correlations themselves may be used in a test of fit to the model. A formulation of the Environmental Model for this case was given by Reich et al. (1979) for a two-disease model and applied to data on diastolic hypertension.
THE SEX EFFECT MODEL FOR
SEMICONTINUOUS TRAITS
The multifactorial model for threshold characters has been described by Falconer (1965,1967), Reich et al. (1972,1975) and Curnow and Smith (1975). In this model it is assumed that the manifestation of a qualitative trait is governed by a normally distributed variable X, termed the liability scale. Affectational status is determined by a threshold, with an individual being "affected" if his score on X is above the threshold and "unaffected" otherwise.

Rice et al

Social Biology

For the sex effect model, we assume liability scales Xx and X2 for males and females, respectively.
The above models are formulated in terms of Xt and X2 and their correlations between relatives, together with the threshold values for males and females. The correlations between relatives may be estimated using the tetrachoric correlation coefficient (Rice et al., 1979) and the threshold values from population prevalences. Although the models for qualitative traits require the prevalences of affected males and females as two additional parameters, direct estimates are usually available and may be incorporated into an analysis.
In the case of semicontinuous traits, a sexual dimorphism on the (unobserved) liability scales is reflected as differences in frequencies on the observed qualitative scales.
APPLICATIONS OF THE MODELS
We applied the above models in the analysis of the transmission of spatial visu-

alizing ability, a trait which exhibits markedly different distributions in males and females. Maximum-likelihood parameter estimates were obtained from reported correlations using a FORTRAN program XTAU, available upon request. The likelihood function was computed as described by Rice et al. (1978), and the general purpose searching program MAXLIK (Kaplan and Elston, 1972) was used for maximization.
Several studies of spatial ability had suggested the influence of an X-linked major locus in the transmission of spatial ability (Stafford, 1961; Hartlage, 1970; Bock and Kolakowski, 1973). However, more recent studies have cast doubt upon this hypothesis (DeFries et al., 1976; Bouchard and McGee, 1977; Loehlin et al., 1978; Park et al., 1978). The reported parent-offspring correlations from these latter studies are displayed in Table 2 along with the sample size (number of pairs of relatives) given in parentheses. A test of equality of the four sex-specific parent-offspring correlations is reported in the last column (Snedecor and Coch-

The last row of Table 2 consists of correlations obtained by pooling those of Bouchard and McGee (1978) and Loehlin et al. (1978). Each pooled correlation was obtained by taking the weighted sum of the two corresponding Z-transformed correlations and then taking the inverse Ztransformation (Snedecor and Cochran, 1967). The "effective" sample size (the sum of the two sample sizes less three) for the pooled correlations is given in parentheses.
The sibling correlations reported by Bouchard and McGee (1978) and Loehlin et al. (1978) are displayed in Table 3. The former set of correlations and the pooled correlations were found to be heterogeneous at the 0.05 significance level while those of Loehlin et al. (1978) were not, reflecting their small sample sizes. We shall apply the above models to the pooled correlations reported in Tables 2 and 3 after giving a brief description of the two samples.
The sample of Bouchard and McGee (1978) consisted of 801 individuals from 200 families ascertained through University of Minnesota undergraduate students. The students were administered the Mental Rotation Test (Vandenberg, 1975) and the Hidden Patterns Test and were then trained to administer these tests to their

family members between the ages of 11 and 69. The correlations in Tables 2 and 3 are the reported Mental Rotation Test correlations after correcting for age using Z scores in five-year age intervals. Bouchard and McGee also report that only 20 per cent of females scored above the male median.
The sample of Loehlin et al. (1978) consisted of 192 families in the Tel Aviv area. Each family contained a father, mother, and two children at least 13 years of age with an upper limit of 60 years of age for the parents. Families were tested in their homes with a battery of tests adapted from the Educational Testing Service Kit of cognitive tests. Scores were adjusted using a multiple regression equation with years of education, birth rank, and a quadratic in age as independent variables. The correlations displayed in Tables 2 and 3 are age-adjusted scores based on a composite scale derived from scores on card rotations, cube comparisons, hidden patterns, and paper folding. Loehlin et al. also report that the mean score for males was significantly higher than that for females.
The results of the analyses are displayed in Table 4. Parameter estimates for separate analyses of the two data sets are displayed in brackets to allow monitoring of the effect of pooling. To obviate the problem of indeterminance, T was fixed at 0.5 in all of the analyses. The program

any of the sex-specific cultural mechanisms which we have described.
The conclusion that cn + cn + ^ i n d i cates that the nontransmissible environmental factors relevant to the development of spatial ability are different for males and females. This is compatible with the argument that boys are encouraged in the home to engage in activities which enhance the development of spatial ability, whereas girls are not. These factors would be nontransmissible if they depend only on the offspring's sex and not on the parental spatial ability scores themselves. This could also explain in part why a2 < au although sex differences in cortical organization is an alternative explanation for these mean differences. Further research is needed before the relative contributions of biological and sociocultural factors can be determined.
DISCUSSION
The models we propose are an attempt to relax two assumptions which are implicit in the standard polygenic model for a phenotype P when partitioned into its genetic and environmental components as P = G + E. The first assumption is that E is uncorrelated between a parent and his offspring. Cultural inheritance is one source of such a covariance which may be important for many behavioral or developmental phenotypes. Another possibility is that a genotype "seeks out" certain environments so that G and £ are correlated within an individual and hence would lead to correlated E's between parent and child. The salient point is, however, that such phenomena can be modeled and incorporated into genetic analyses to provide logical and consistent models for complex traits.
The second assumption is that E is uncorrelated between individuals who are

reared contemporaneously. Such covariances may result not only from individuals being reared in the same household, but from E itself being related to covariates such as age or SES. Such hypotheses cannot be explored without models which allow for more comprehensive types of environmental variation. These problems are compounded by the fact that the environmental similarity between two individuals in general increases along with their genetic similarity. We have found path analysis and the related method of structural equations to be a valuable tool in addressing these problems.
Since its introduction in 1918 (Wright, 1918), path analysis has proven a useful technique in many areas of genetics. In contrast, its applications in the social sciences have by and large been unfruitful (Duncan, 1975). This has occurred in part because even a few variables will produce too many plausible diagrams relating these variables if no a priori casual schema can be deduced. In genetics, however, only a few causal patterns are reasonable in most situations so that only a few models need to be considered. In the investigation of behavioral phenotypes, models which first consider the causes of familial resemblance, both genetic and environmental, are more likely to be fruitful than "shotgun" approaches which use many variables to produce ad hoc models. The high covariances between family members for many phenotypes indicate that interfamilial variations can explain a large portion of the total variances for these phenotypes.
In analyzing the spatial ability data we chose to test the equality of all four parent-offspring correlations as a first step in our analysis. Unless the pattern of correlations is predicted a priori, this is necessary to avoid the pitfalls of multiple comparisons. No clear pattern is apparent in Table 2 across the individual studies. Dif-

ferent measures ofspatial ability are used in these studies of different populations, so no definitive conclusion should be made. It is clear, however, from Table 2 that an X-linked model does not seem likely.
