ABSTRACT: This paper presents a technique for scaling contraceptive use motivation for the sample population of the Family Planning Health Services Project in Matlab. The project, which began in 1977, is conducted by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh. The hypothesis of the research is that through the use of a scaling algorithm the power of demographic characteristics, attitudes, and intentions for predicting contraceptive use can be enhanced. The analysis shows that two factors explain use motivation. Scale 1is weighted for demographic variables and desire for additional children, while Scale 2 is comprised of education and intentions of contraceptive use. Both scales have a pronounced independent predictive power. We conclude that scaling has improved upon the predictive power of indicators of reproductive motivations.

Considerable attention in the demographic literature has been addressed to the question of whether stated reproductive intentions are meaningful indicators of subsequent reproductive behavior. Prospective studies have demonstrated the inconsistency between stated intentions and behavior (Kar, 1978; Freedman, 1975; and Hermalin, 1979). Much of the methodological work on intentions and behavior attempts to bring into account the multidimensionality of preference. For example, Coombs et. al. (1973) have developed a method from scaling theory which incorporates multiple responses about alternative family composition into the construction of a single preference scale.
This paper utilizes three years of data from Matlab to test a procedure for measuring underlying motivation to practice family planning. The underlying logic derives from the observation that many characteristics of women cor-

relate in some way to contraceptive use, and each variable thus reflects "motivation" to some degree. Consequently, a simple measure of intentions as apredictor of contraceptive use can be improved upon by considering other influential variables. In this analysis we examine a set of variables which we posit as correlates of contraceptive use. Hypothesized predisposing characteristics of users function as independent variables, and use of contraceptives is the dependent variable. In order to prepare a multidimensional scale of the independent variables, factor analysis is applied to the data set.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In December 1977, two months after initiation of the Family Planning Health Services Project (FPHSP) in Matlab, a survey was conducted to serve as a baseline for measuring subsequent changes in knowledge of use of and intention to

use contraception. Among the respondents of the original sample, 20 per cent were reinterviewed in December 1978 and December 1979. The design of the field aspects of the FPHSP and the services provided have been documented by Bhatia (1980) and the system of record keeping and service statistics were documented by Rahman (1981). Research has shown that the FPHSP has had a significant impact on fertility (Phillips, 1982) and child mortality (Chowdhury, 1986). In the baseline survey in 1977, all the eligible women of FPHSP were interviewed with a questionnaire, known as Record Keeping System-1. Items of information in the questionnaire include: sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents, their knowledge and use of contraception, desire for additional children, and intention to use contraception in the future.

In the original sample, there were approximately 13,000 eligible women interviewed, and from among these 20 per cent were selected using proportional allocation according to the size of villages. There were 2,299 eligible women after an exclusion of 11.5 per cent of women who lost their eligibility because of divorce, widowhood, sterilization, migration out, and husband absent from household. These women were subsequently reinterviewed in .1978 and again in 1979. In all, 2,217 and 2,120 women were found to be present in the first and the second rounds of the survey, respectively. Among the respondents of the three different surveys, 2,111 were found to be present in all the surveys. These respondents constitute the sample for the analysis in this paper. Thus, the nonresponse rate is 8.2 per cent in this study.

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
The conceptual framework for this analysis appears in Figure 1. Motivation to use contraception (M) is viewed as a proximate determinant of use (U), Path
(1). Motivation, in turn, is affected by re-
productive norms, attitudes, and beliefs (A), Path (2). This, in turn, has two causal components. Demographic characteristics, such as number of living children, directly affect motivation, Path (3), and also directly affect attitudes, Path (4), through the impact of sex preference on the desire for additional children. Background characteristics (B) such as educational attainment and economic status also directly affect motivation, Path (5), and attitudes, Path (6).

RESULTS
SCALING CONTRACEPTIVE USE
MOTIVATION
It is useful to note that scaling theory posits that some unmeasured construct has measured indicators, each with an unknown weight representing the specific contribution of an indicator to the scale. Factor analysis is one among many techniques that can be used to identify commonality of a set of indicators, to quantify their relationship to the unmeasured scale, and to thereby permit scoring of each individual on the scale by simply summing the weights associated with the particular attributes of each case (Goruch, 1974).
A representation of a common factor model for individual i is a linear model of the form:

+ WVU,V

(1)

where
xiv is a predicted response of individual / to dependent variable v.
Wvi is variable weight for Factor 1. Fu is score of individual i for the first factor. Wvf is loading of variable v for Factor/. Fflis the factor of individual i common factor/. Wv is the weight given to variable. t/jV is unique factor score of individual i for variable v.
The Uv ate factors derived from the generalization of individual variation to the sample population--"the within individual" component to variation.
Table 1 shows that two factors explain "use motivation" and the logit regression results at the bottom of the table show that these scales predict use with about the same degree of goodness of fit as the raw data (Likelihood Ratio Statistics = 373.3 versus 394.8) which was found on predicting power of contraceptive use by a logit regression model by Chowdhury (1983). The loadings show that Scale 1is weighted for demographic variables and desire for additional children, while Scale 2 is comprised of education, intentions, and current use. As the logit results show, both the scales have a pronounced independent predictive power that greatly exceeds the effect of any single indicator.
Table 1 also shows that varimax matrix rotation improves the precision of loadings in that the loadings for the two scales are more distinct, but the magnitude and signs of the rotated loadings are not appreciably changed.
The logit regression results attest to the utility of scaling. For example, if a respondent was one standard deviation above the mean on the "demographic pressure" and "reproductive intention"

scales in 1977, her predicted probability of use two years later is given by:
P = [1 + Exp{-(- 0.801 + 0.837 X 1.712 + 0.457 X 0.684)}] = 0.720
Similarly, an exceptionally motivated respondent who is two standard deviations above the mean with respect to both scales has a predicted use probability of
P = [1 + Exp{-(- 0.801 + 0.837 x 1.712 x 2 + 0.457 x 0.684 x 2)}] = 0.936
Clearly, scaling has improved upon the predictive power of indicators of reproductive motivation.

Attitude, in Figure 1, is multidimensional with family size desires and demographics reflecting a "demographic pressure dimension," and with intention and husband's education reflecting a separate factor which represents a "reproductive planning" dimension. Husband's education has an effect that is largely distinct from desire for additional children but is associated with intention and use. Intention, current use, and education load well into a common factor. The effect of demographic factors on contraceptive use is mediated by family size desires. Most importantly, the paper has shown that a set of indicators, taken together, are highly predictive of contraceptive use.

DISCUSSION
On the basis of the above analysis it was found that motivation to use contraceptives is multidimensional in nature and should not be measured by intentions alone. The predominant influence was exercised by the demographic factors of age, living children, and living sons, and the attitudinal factors of desire for additional children and intentions.
