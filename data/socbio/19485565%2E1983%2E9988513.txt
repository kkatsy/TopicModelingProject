ABSTRACT: The frequencies for the alleles IA, IB, IO, D, and d of the ABO and Rh blood groups for populations from metropolitan Monterrey, Nuevo León, and from neighboring states in northeastern Mexicowere ascertained along with those from other populations thought to have contributed to their genetic constitution, i.e., Mexican natives (Nahuas, Mexicas, and Tlaxcaltecans), Mestizos (from Mexico City), Western Europeans (Spanish, Portuguese, French, and German), and eastern Mediterraneans (Sephardic Jews). Genetic admixtures and distances were estimated, and three dimensional diagrams were elaborated. It was found that the populations that immigrated to the area area after 1940are the ones that have received a greater genetic contribution from Mexican natives. The populations thought descended from the immigrants that colonized northeastern Mexico four centuries ago were shown to have received a high genetic contribution from Spanish, a lesser contribution from French, German and Portuguese, and a low contribution from the Sephardic Jews.

The area of metropolitan Monterrey in the state of Nuevo Leon in northeastern Mexico was colonized between 1577 and 1596 by immigrants from Spain who were a mixture of Spanish (31.7 per cent) and Portuguese and Sephardic Jews (68.3 per cent) from northern Portugal (del Hoyo, 1979), and they had almost no admixture with the nomadic native populations of that region (Cossio, 1925). During the next three centuries there was some immigration of Spanish and Mestizos from the central and northeastern states of Mexico and of some native Indians, mainly Tlaxcaltecans (del Hoyo, 1979). During the French invasion, 1862 to 1867, some Western Europeans arrived in the area (Roel, 1958). At the end of the nineteenth century industrial development was started in the Monterrey area, and in 1910the city had more foreigners than any other city in Mexico, 2,366 of 78,528 residents. These foreign residents were

from the United States of America (53 per cent), France (13 per cent), Canada (12 per cent), and Germany (6 per cent) (Montemayor, 1971). During the Mexican Revolution, 1910-17, immigration was from the northeastern states of Mexico.
Immigration has increased since 1940 due to the industrial growth in the area. During the decade 1960-70, nearly 400,000 immigrants arrived from states of San Luis Potosi, Coahuila, Tamaulipas, Zacatecas, and from Mexico City (Montemayor, 1971).
In order to determine the effect of this mixed ancestral background on the subpopulations inhabiting this metropolitan area, we calculated the genetic distances for the various subpopulations in the region and compared them with each other; with other populations in Mexico; and with populations from other countries. In this way we assessed the influence of differential ancestral

Thus, the impact of the demographic and political history on the genetic structure of the region could be determined.

It is thought that the last two populations are the most closely descended from the immigrants who colonized northeastern Mexico.

In order to have genetic marker information on a large number of individuals and avoid the problems of small sample size, we elett'ed lo utilize information about the ABO and Rh(D) blood groups which were already available from records'. "We were able to obtain information about ABO and Rh(D) blood groups from the following populations:

From these data, gene frequencies for alleles D and d were calculated based on the principles of Hardy (1908) and Weinberg (1908) for population genetics, and the alleles of the ABO system were computed with Bernstein's method (1925).
The gene frequencies from these five populations give a good representation of the diversity of gene pools of the subpopulations in the Monterrey area.

Using the data from these five derived subpopulations, and the six putative ancestral populations, admixture estimates were calculated using the techniques suggested by Adams and Ward (1973). In addition, genetic distances between the populations are calculated using the method of CavalliSforza and Edwards (1967), and these genetic distances were used to construct diagrams which represented the threedimensional configuration of the eleven populations. It should be noted that with only three independent alleles in the analysis, all the information can be reduced to three dimensions and hence can be readily represented on such a diagram. The use of such diagrams to investigate admixture was first outlined by Pollitzer (1958). Both the admixture estimates and the distribution of genetic distances were used to evaluate the relative contribution of the putative ancestral populations to the present-day subpopulations in the Monterrey area.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The gene frequencies of the alleles IA, IB, 1°, D, and d for the ABO and Rh(D) blood groups of the populations included in this study are shown in Table 1.
In this table it can be observed that the alleles, frequencies in the populations from the metropolitan area of Monterrey and neighboring states (Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Tamaulipas) are intermediate between those of the native populations of Mexico and the Spanish, Western Europeans, and Sephardic Jews, with the Mestizos from Mexico City intermediate between the northeastern Mexico populations.

tions and Mexican native populations is compatible with the results of the admixture estimates above.
The two most genetically similar populations are the Mestizo population'and the I.M.S.S. population, with the smallest genetic distances in the table. Hence, the I.M.S.S. population can be regarded as being representative of the "average" Mestizo population, interms ofits genetic origin. The two private hospital populations are also genetically similar and are both substantially closer to the European populations than any of the other present-day populations. However, it will also be noted that these two private hospital populations aresubstantially closer tothe three European populations than they are to the Sephardic Jewish population. This suggests that the distribution of individualadmixture estimates presented above is somewhat misleading.
To resolve this issue, the genetic distances of the sixpresent-day Mexico populations were plotted onto a triangle representing the genetic distances between three presumptive ancestral populations. One of these is always the presumed Mexican native population, the second population being the Spanish, as the most dominant contributor of foreign genes. The third population is one of the other possible contributors, such as Western European (French/German), Figure 1A; Portuguese, Figure IB, or Sephardic Jews, Figure 1C. After making the plots, we observed that when the triangle is formed with theFrench and German all thenortheastern populations lie inside thetriangle and the private-hospital population from Nuevo Leon lies almost directly on the line connecting Mexican natives to French and German, suggesting that these populations have genetically contributed in a

formation. It isfairly clear forthe populations which have experienced smaller levels of European admixture that the Sephardic Jews have had little influence. For the two private hospital populations, where European contribution to the gene pool has predominated, the situation issomewhat more ambiguous.
The combined information from the admixture estimates and the geneticdistance estimates suggest that, while southern European populations (Spanish and Portuguese) have had a predominant influence on the genetic constitution of these populations, another ancestral population was also important. Judging from Figure 1A, it is quite likely that the third contributor tothe gene pool of the two private-hospital populations was from the Western European population, represented by present-day French andGerman popu-

lations. On the other hand, it ispossible that the gene frequencies of Sephardic Jews who participated in the earlyhistory of northeastern Mexico were different from the present-day gene frequencies used in this analysis. Hence, the possibility of a genetic contribution by Sephardic Jews tothe private population can not beruled out, though on the whole, it appears unlikely.
