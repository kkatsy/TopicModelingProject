ABSTRACT: An analysis of mortality rates documents that the well-established female advantage in mortality continues to increase. Data from the U.S. census show that the sex differential in mortality has increased from 1.69 in 1963 to 1.82 in 1976. The age groups which show the most pronounced changes are youth (15-24), young adults (25-34), and old persons (75-84). Following Enterline (1961), we assess the major causes of death within each of these age groups in terms of their relative contributions to changing sex ratios. The major factors among young persons, apart from declining maternal mortality, are found to involve violent deaths, especially traffic accidents and suicide. Among old persons, death rates in general have declined, but advances in medical technology appear to have been more beneficial for older women than for older men, supporting the hypothesis of a biological superiority among women. However, death rates for malignant neoplasms have increased for older women as well as older men, suggesting that changing life styles may eventually have an impact on female mortality. The data suggest a need for additional research concerning the increase in violent deaths among young women and the potential increase in cancer deaths among older women.

ity, from increases in mortality, or from quantitative differences in the magnitude of male and female rates both moving in the same direction? These three basic questions, phrased somewhat more obliquely, were addressed by Enterline (1961) in his analysis of trends in American mortality from 1920 to 1958. The purpose of the present paper is to provide more contemporary answers to these three questions, using Enterline's approach and drawing on data from the United States for 1963 and 1976.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
ASSESSING SEX DIFFERENCESIN
MORTALITY
The first step in examining mortality differentials is simply to look at crude death rates in a given population over time. In 1963, among the white population of the United States, the death rate per 100,000 was 921.1 for men, compared with 546.0 for women. The sex mortality ratio was therefore 1.69. By 1976, the rates for men and women were 798.8 and 439.6 respectively, with a consequent increase in the sex ratio to 1.82.
Since mortality varies importantly with age, it is also necessary to assess sex mortality ratios using age-specific data. When this is done, two generalizations emerge. First, it is apparent that, other things being equal, sex mortality ratios are lowest at the extremes of the life cycle, among the very young and the very old. Second, when one examines changes over time, it is apparent that not all age groups contribute equally to the increasing mortality differential. From 1963 to 1976, the sex ratio increased by 13 per cent. For the purposes of analysis, we will examine the three age categories which showed the highest degree

of change: youths and adolescents aged 15-24 (39 per cent); young adults aged 25-34 (36 per cent) and old persons (22 per cent). Among babies and among persons in late middle age, there is actually a slight reversal of the dominant trend (Table 1).
The observation of a sex mortality differential by age immediately suggests a discrepancy in cause of death. It is to be expected that the old and the young die of different causes. What contribution to the whole change in the death rate is made by any one cause of death? The answer to this question must take into account not only the rate of changes in death rates by cause of death, but also the importance of each cause of death in contributing to deaths in toto.
Calculations of the relative contribution to change made by specific causesof death are based on the formula used by Enterline(1961,p. 316):

It should be noted that for long time intervals, such as are being considered here, this formula: ". . . is approximate, and contributions by individual causes do not add exactly to the total increment in the sex mortality ratio" (Enterline, 1961,p. 316).
The proportionate contribution of various causes of death in the three groups showing the most marked change are given in Tables 2, 3 and 4, based on causes of death which accounted for at least 2.5 per cent of the total deaths in each age group.1 The changes occurring in each age group are described and discussed separately.
RESULTS
MORTALITY DIFFERENTIALS AMONG
YOUTHS
In the forty-year span examined by Enterline, the largest increases in mortality differentials were found among young persons 15-24, among whom the sex ratio increased from 1.16 in 1929-31, to 2.65 in 1956-58 (Enterline, 1961, p. 315). In the period subject to our attention, 1963 to 1976, the sex ratio again increased markedly, from 2.52 to 2.91, with the result that the death rate for young men is nearly three times that of young women (Table 1).
The relative contributions of various causes of death to changing sex ratios among young persons are presented in Table 2. The most obvious of these is the decline in maternal mortality among young women, which accounts for 17.43
1In assessing changes over time, an inevitable problem is the variation in the available statistics. A certain lack of comparability exists in the data presented due to the revision of the classification of causes of death. The data for 1963were based on the Seventh Revision of the International List of Causes; for 1976, on the Eighth Revision.

per cent of the change. Both sexes showed declines in deaths due to cardiovascular disease and malignant neoplasms, but these were more marked for young women than for young men.
The most important changes relate to violent deaths. Although homicide deaths are generally rare, they increased disproportionately among males. More important was the increase in male suicide, which alone accounts for almost one quarter (23.44 per cent) of the variance. Counterbalancing these trends to some extent was the increase in accidental deaths among women. Although mortality from motor vehicle accidents increases for both sexes, it increased proportionately more for women, as did other accidents.
MORTALITY DIFFERENTIALS AMONG
YOUNG ADULTS
From 1963 to 1976, the sex mortality ratio in the age group 25-34 increased from 1.94 to 2.30, an increment (36 per cent) almost as large as that among youths. The causes of death responsible for this change, and their relative contributions, are given in Table 3. The pattern is similar to that of younger persons, but is not identical. Since women in this age group are more involved in childbearing than their younger counterparts, it is not surprising that the largest factor (19.61 per cent) is due to the reduction in maternal mortality. Falling rates due to cardiovascular disease showed greater gains for women, as did those for malignancies, accounting respectively for 15.5 per cent and 9.45 per cent of the observed change. As with younger persons, suicide continued to increase and to increase disproportionately for males, but the discrepancies were not as great and accounted for only 16.09 per cent of the change.

tains to respiratory cancer, and to other associated pathologies such as cardiovascular disease (Waldron, 1976). Retherford (1975) estimates that approximately 75 per cent of the increase in the male-female differential in life expectancy (between the ages of 37 and 87) over the period from 1910to 1962can be accounted for by the effects of smoking. Traditionally, American society has accepted cigarette smoking for men and discouraged it for women. While smoking has never been culturally prescribed as part of the male gender role, the differential use of cigarettes by men and women is, nevertheless, related to our system of gender roles with its resulting double standard. Older women in 1976 enjoyed a mortality rate favorable, to that of older men in part because most of them had not smoked or had not smoked heavily. However, the proportion of young women who smoke cigarettes has increased in recent years (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1976; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1978), and as this occurs it seems likely that the rates of tobaccorelated pathologies of women will increase as women who smoke reach midlife.
IMPLICATIONS
The male role includes many aspects which, if not exactly "lethal," are at least potentially dangerous to one's health (Jourard, 1974). The emphasis on being strong may lead men to interpret signs of illness as signs of weakness and therefore to suppress or to ignore them as long as possible, rather than making an immediate effort to seek help. The discouragement of selfdisclosure, together with an emphasis on the pursuit of instrumental goals at

the expense of emotional ones, may lead to undue levels of stress, some of which may lead to suicidal tendencies (Jourard, 1974). The privileged enjoyment of tobacco and of alcohol carry with it well-known health hazards to lungs and liver. In addition, what David and Brannon (1976) call the "Give 'em Hell" dimension of the male sex role guides men to present a self which contains an aura of aggression, violence, and daring. The resulting proclivity for violent death is especially manifest among young men.
If the male role is indeed dangerous to one's health, it is not as dangerous as it used to be. Except for young men in their prime "Give 'em Hell" years, male death rates have systematically declined at all ages. If society is becoming more androgynous, as many persons contend that it is, it may be that some men are becoming more feminine in their behaviors and outlook. However, the move toward androgynous behavior is less likely to involve men becoming more feminine than it is to involve women becoming more masculine. Changing gender expectations emphasize the ways in which women can come to act like men more than the alternative of men coming to act more like women. In health terms, this may well constitute a significant factor in changes in the sex mortality ratios. It seems unlikely that female death rates will ever exceed or even equal male death rates, at least in the forseeable future. However, it is possible that the biological advantage enjoyed by women may be substantially modified if they do indeed come to act in more masculine ways and to enjoy masculine privilege in terms of smoking, drinking, driving, and other forms of risk taking.
