ABSTRACT:This paper reports on an examination of whether the effects of farm background on socioeconomic differentials in fertility are diminished among nonfarm couples. The data are for a sample of white ever-married women belonging to the 1901-1910 birth cohorts. The research provides another test of the two-generation-urbanite hypothesis first advanced by Goldberg. Unlike a number of other studies, the findings do not support the hypothesis. Reasons for the lack of support are discussed, and methodological weaknesses of previous studies are identified.

In 1959, Goldberg noted that the socioeconomic differentials in fertility observed for urban couples was produced by the relatively high fertility of couples with a farm background before marriage. On the basis of this finding, aswell as a similar finding for another urban population, Goldberg (1960) proposed the two-generation-urbanite hypothesis, stating that the existence in urban populations of an inverse pattern of fertility by socioeconomic status "results largely or entirely from the fertility behavior of farm migrants. . . ." Freedman and Slesinger (1961) extended this hypothesis to apply to the entire nonfarm population, not just urban populations. They found some confirmation of the hypothesis for two-generationnonfarm couples. Further support for this hypothesis was provided by Duncan (1965) in his study of a national sample.
In effect, the two-generationurbanite hypothesis became in reality the two-generation-nonfarm hypothesis. Not only was farm background

firmly established as an important determinant of fertility, but the expectation has been that fertility differentials bysocioeconomic status would gradually diminish and even disappear once the population became predominantly urban. Indeed, the general view expressed by a number of demographers is that, as various subpopulations adopt modern values and norms and are absorbed into the modern economic system, the major socioeconomic differentials in fertility will disappear (see, for example, Freedman and Slesinger, 1961;Ryder, 1973).
More recently, McGirr and Hirschman (1979) have questioned the validity of this expectation. In their analysis of data from the 1960Growth of American Families Study and the 1965 and 1970 National Fertility Surveys, fairly strong fertility differentials among nonfarm couples regardless of farm background were observed. Moreover, they suggest that the previous finding may have been confined to particular cohorts of American women who completed most of their

childbearing prior to the baby-boom period. Because of this discrepancy of findings in different studies and the view that the relationship between farm background and socioeconomic differentials in fertility obtained only before the baby boom, a reanalysis of fertility differentials with data for the 19011910 birth cohorts is particularly appropriate.
By the time of the baby boom, the cohorts of 1901-1910 were near or at the end of their childbearing period. Further, these cohorts are distinctive in terms of having the lowest completed family size in U.S. demographic history. Also, they grew up in a period when the nation was not yet highly urbanized. By 1920, when women belonging to the 1901-1910 cohorts were 10-20 years of age, only slightly more than one-half (51 per cent) of the American population was urban.
In this paper we analyze data from a national sample of white ever-married women belonging to the 1901-1910 birth cohorts to investigate the effects of farm background on socioeconomic differentials in fertility. We find, as McGirr and Hirschman (1979) did, that farm background before marriage does not account for the socioeconomic differentials in fertility observed among nonfarm couples. Further, we suggest that the earlier findings of Goldberg (1959, 1960), Freedman and Slesinger (1961) and Duncan (1965) are most likely the result of employing data in which a relatively large number of cohorts are aggregated and/or different measures of farm background and socioeconomic status are used.
In the next section we discuss our data and methods and compare them with previous studies. We then present

our analysis and explore some of the implications of ourfindingsconcerning the nonsupport of the two-generationnonfarm hypothesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data examined in this paper are retrospective reproductive histories obtained in personal interviews with a national probability sample of 1,049 white, ever-married women born between July 1,1900and June 30,1910. At the time of interview, 1978, the women were 67 to 77 years of age. Excluded from the sample were women residing in institutions (less than 5 per cent), women marrying for the first time at age 45 or later, and foreign-born women who migrated to the United States after attaining age 30. The interview response rate was 71.6 per cent.
As with all surveys, these data are subject to various types of error, such as sampling errors and errors made during the collection and processing of data. In addition to these types of error, these data are subject to two important sources of potential bias, namely selective nonresponse and selective mortality. Previous surveys of the elderly (Atchley, 1961; Benus and Ackerman, 1971; Kish, 1965) and our pretest experience indicated that we might expect a relatively high rate of nonresponse. Therefore, a follow-up of all nonrespondents was planned to occur shortly after the completion of the fieldwork (Ridley et al., 1979) as well as the usual type of analysis as to the representativeness of the sample in 1978. In addition, a comparison of the sample with 1950 census data for the cohorts of 1901-1910 was undertaken to assess the representativeness of the sample when the women be-

longing to these cohorts were near or at the end of their childbearing period. The results of these various tests of the adequacy of the sample indicated that the identified biases of nonresponse and mortality of the sample could be addressed byweighting the sample by employing 1950 census data on urban-rural residence, education, and parity for white ever-married women belonging to the 1901-1910 cohorts (Ridley, 1981). The effects of nonresponse as well as mortality are thus adjusted for by this weighting.1 In the analysis reported in this paper weighted data for the sample are utilized.
Table 1 summarizes the samples and the measures of farm background, socioeconomic status, and fertility employed in previous studies. As indicated, Goldberg's analyses were confined to samples in two urban communities, while the studies by the other investigators as well as this study are based on nationally representative samples. Among theearlier studies, onlythe sample employed byDuncan, (1965)included both white and black women. Goldberg's (1959, 1960) samples were confined to white women as were those of Freedman and Slesinger (1961) and McGirr and Hirschman (1979). Thus, for present purposes, the restriction of the sample of the 1901-1910 birth cohorts to white women is not viewed as serious. Moreover, Duncan's (1965)
1A detailed assessment of the representativeness of the sample has been conducted. The most serious underrepresentation is that of childless women. On the basis of the 1950 census data, 19.2 per cent of white ever-married women were childless while registration data indicated a proportion closer to 20per cent. In fact, only 14.4per centof the sample reported they had no live births. Thus, the unweighted sample would produce a somewhat higher overall mean fertility than the weighted sample.

findings held when each race was considered separately.2 Since all of the previous studies focused on currently married couples, our initial analysis is restricted to women who reported they were currently married in 1950. In further explorations of the data, we restrict the analysis to women married to their first husband for at least ten years.
To replicate as closely as possible the previous analyses, data are needed for four measures: (1) farm background before marriage of the wife and of her husband; (2) couples' current residence; (3) a measure of socioeconomic status; and (4) number of live births.
Wives and their husbands are classified in our sample as having a farm background based on the responses to the following question: "Did you (he) ever live on a farm before you were married?" This classification coincides most closely with the measures used by Freedman and Slesinger (1961) and McGirr and Hirshman (1979). Freedman and Slesinger employed "ever lived on a farm before marriage" while McGirr's and Hirschman's measure was "longest residence before marriage." Goldberg (1959, 1960) and Duncan (1965), however, based their measures on whether the wife's and husband's fathers had a farm occupation.3
2Another study (Kuhn and Munson, 1979) employing data for black couples from the 1973 National Survey of Family Growth, however, confirmed the findings of McGirr and Hirschman (1979).
'Extensive pretesting prior to the survey indicated that few women knew their husband's father's occupation. Thus, this question was not included in the final interview schedule. For the 536 women in our sample who reported having lived on a farm before marriage, 70 per cent reported that their father's main occupation when they were growing up was a farm occupation. Seventy-seven per cent of these women reported having spent at least half of their life on a farm before marriage with 82 per cent reporting a farm occupation for their father.

The measurement of current residence did not pose a problem to the other investigators since they used residence at the time of interview. To rely on women's residence at the time of interview for our sample did not seem reasonable, since these women were interviewed when they were 67 to 77 years of age. Instead, we employ the data on reported residence in 1950 when the women were approximately 40 to 49 years of age for purposes of classifying women as to farm or nonfarm residence.4 This measure is quite comparable to those used by Goldberg (1959, 1960), Duncan (1965), and McGirr and Hirschman (1979) since they confined their analyses to women near or at the end of their childbearing period.
In addition to residence in 1950, in some analyses we employ a measure of residence during the first ten years of married life. This measure is based on the husband's occupation at marriage or ten years after marriage. If the husband's occupation was reported as a farm occupation at either point in time, the couple was classified as residing on a farm sometime during the first ten years of married life.
Although Goldberg (1959,1960) employed several measures of socioeconomic status, all the investigators including Goldberg used educational attainment. By employing educational attainment as a measure of socioeconomic status, we can compare our findings with all the previous studies. Also, education is generally completed by marriage and consequently tends to be invariate over the childbearing period. Because of our small sample size, we
4The questions were: "In 1950, did you live in a town of 2,500 or more; a town of less than 2,500; or the open country? " If open country or size of place was unknown: "Was that on a farm?"

categorize wife's and husband's educational attainment into four levels: 0-7 years, 8-11 years, 12 years, and 13 or more years.
Finally, for the measure of fertility we use the total number of live births as reported by the women in our sample. With the exception of Freedman and Slesinger (1961) who, in addition to number of live births, employed expected number of live births as a proxy for completed fertility, all the other studies relied exclusively on number of live births.
RESULTS

Table 2 presents the mean number of live births by residence in 1950 and husband's and wife's farm background before marriage for women belonging to the 1901-1910 birth cohorts who were currently married in 1950. In this table, data are shown for the 943 couples for whom information is available on residence in 1950 and farm background. As would be expected, very few couples (16 per cent) were residing on a farm in 1950. Among these couples the 119 farm couples with a farm background exhibit fertility substantially higher than for couples with a nonfarm residence in 1950.

In analyzing our data to test the twogeneration-nonfarm hypothesis, we first use the design employed by Duncan (1965) and later replicated by McGirr and Hirschman (1979). We then turn to data on farm experience after marriage available for our sample of women belonging to the 1901-1910 birth cohorts. Rather than using the nonhierarchial model employed by Duncan and by McGirr and Hirschman, we employ a somewhat more flexible parameterization of the general linear model, referred to as the cell means model (Hocking and Speed, 1975;Namboodiri et al., 1975).

Since the focus of the twogeneration-nonfarm hypothesis is on couples with a nonfarm residence, further analysis is restricted to the first two columns of Table 2. Couples with a nonfarm residence in 1950 among whom neither the husband nor wife had a farm background (i.e., the two-generationnonfarm residents) exhibit the lowest fertility, an average of 2.0 births; yet their fertility is hardly distinguishable from the fertility of 1950 nonfarm residents among whom only the wife had a farm background (i.e., 2.1 births). In contrast, if the husband had a farm background, the fertility of nonfarm

couples is somewhat higher, an average of 2.5 births, regardless of wife's farm background. Among nonfarm couples, husband's farm background, therefore, appears to be more important than that of the wife in its effect on fertility.
To test whether this is the case we use the cell means model. For the data shown in the first two columns of Table 2 the model is written for each individual as follows:

Y=

i+e

where,
Y = mean number of live births hi -- the regression coefficient for each
group; its estimated value is interpreted as the mean number of live births x\ = 1, for couples having a nonfarm residence in 1950 and husband and wife a nonfarm background; 0, otherwise %i = 1, for couples having a nonfarm residence in 1950 and only the wife a farm background; 0, otherwise *3 = 1, for couples having a nonfarm residence in 1950 and only the husband a farm background; 0, otherwise x4 = 1, for couples having a nonfarm residence in 1950 and both husband and wife a farm background; 0, otherwise e = the stochastic error term.
Before examining whether the couple's farm background has significant main effects on the total number of births, we first test whether there is an interaction between husband's and wife's farm background among couples with a nonfarm residence in 1950. The result of the test indicates that husband's farm background and wife's farm background have independent effects on fertility (F = 0.046, df = l,790,p > 0.05).

An analysis of the main effects indicates, as expected, that husband's farm background is significant (F = 9.361, df = 1,790, p < 0.01) and wife's farm background is not significant (F = 1.116, df = l,790,/7>0.05).5
This finding that only husband's farm background affects the fertility of nonfarm couples for the sample of 19011910 birth cohorts contrasts with the previous finding of Duncan (1965). His data indicated that nonfarm residents who had no farm experience before marriage had lower fertility than coupleswith a nonfarm residence but with either the wife or husband having a farm background. Therefore, our results conform more closely to those obtained by McGirr and Hirschman (1979) for the cohorts of 1911-35. We should note that Goldberg (1959) employed only husband's farm background and in his later study (1960) did not differentiate between husband's and wife's farm background in his classification of couples with farm background. Freedman's and Slesinger's (1961) classification similarly did not differentiate between husband's and wife's farm background.
The major question posed originally by Goldberg (1959, 1960) and investigated in the subsequent studies, however, is whether the socioeconomic differentials in fertility are diminished (or disappear) among nonfarm residents when only couples with a nonfarm background are considered. The data in Table 3 present the mean number of live births for couples having a nonfarm resi-
5Because the distribution of the dependent variable, number of live births, is skewed, we also tested these hypotheses and subsequent hypotheses using the cell means model by taking the natural logarithm of number of live births. The results were roughly equivalent to those reported here.

dence in 1950 by wife's and husband's farm background and wife's and husband's education. An examination of these data shows that educational differentials in fertility do exist for the nonfarm couples with no farm background as well as for couples where either the husband or wife or both have a farm background. In fact, for the four groups, fertility decreases monotonically as educational level of wife and husband increases. To test whether the observed differentials by wife's and husband's education are significant, we again employ the cell means model written as follows:

Y=

When the appropriate constraints are placed on the model to test the hypothesis that mean fertility across categories of education are equivalent within categories of husband's and wife's farm background, we find that they are not equivalent and thus the differentials are

significant.6 Although these results obtained for the 1901-1910 birth cohorts differ sharply from the findings of Goldberg (1959, 1960), Freedman and Slesinger (1961), and Duncan (1965), they do agree with the results obtained by McGirr and Hirschman (1979). Thus, our data do not support the two-generation-nonfarm hypothesis. Nevertheless, despite the statistical significance of the fertility differentials by wife's and husband's education, there is some attenuation of the differentials among twogeneration-nonfarm couples. We should note, however, that the educational differentials for these couples are considerably greater than those observed by Duncan (1965). He found a differential among two-generationnonfarm couples of only 0.4 births by wife's education and 0.6 by husband's education. In contrast, the differentials we observe are 0.8 for wife's education and 1.3 for husband's education.
To further investigate this discrepancy in our finding regarding fertility differentials by education for nonfarm couples with no farm background, we examined additional data on farm residence available for this sample of women. Although a detailed residential history was not obtained, questions were asked concerning the husband's main occupation at marriage and ten
6The results of the tests of the differentials by wife's education (upper panel, Table 3) are as follows: (1) husband and wife, nonfarm background: F = 3.43, df = 3,778, p < 0.5; (2) husband, nonfarm, and wife, farm: F = 4.36, df = 3,778, p < 0.01; (3) husband, farm, and wife, nonfarm: F = 10.43,df = 3,778,p<0.01;(4)husband and wife, farm: F = 6.67, df = 3,778,p = < 0.01. For husband's education the results are: (1) husband and wife, nonfarm background: F = 4.25, df = 3,778, p < 0.01;(2) husband, nonfarm, and wife, farm: F = 5.96, df = 3,778,p < 0.01; (3) husband, farm, and wife, nonfarm: F = 8.53, df = 3,778, p < 0.01; (4) husband and wife, farm: F = 3.73, df = 3,778,p = < 0.05.

years after marriage. If the husband's occupation was reported as a farm occupation either at the beginning or the end of the ten year period, women were classified as living on a farm at least sometime during the first ten years of marriage. In analyzing these data, the analysis was restricted to those women who were married to their first husband for at least ten years.
Such a classification focuses on what presumably is an important period in a couple's married life and provides a measure of the social milieu in which couples begin their married life. For the vast majority of couples this is the period in which childbearing is initiated; and for many, terminated. Additionally, this is the period in which experience and expertise in the use of contraception is developed. In contrast, a measure of residence at the end of the childbearing period may confound the identification of couples who are nonfarm residents with no farm experience. Residence at the end of the childbearing period may not, for some couples, be a valid indicator of the type of community in which they were living when they made their decisions regarding their childbearing. Moreover, by using data on the farm background of husbands of women currently married in 1950, the data in some instances refer to husbands who were not always the fathers of their children since many women had by 1950 experienced divorce or, widowhood and remarried. Consequently, some couples could have been misclassified as to farm background.
Presumably then, better measures of residence after marriage and farm background should lead to support of the hypothesis that fertility differentials will disappear or become negligible in the nonfarm population. That is, do educa-

Table 4 presents the mean number of live births for women married at least ten years to their first husband who had a nonfarm residence the first ten years of marriage by husband's and wife's farm background and education. As may be seen, an inverse relationship between wife's and husband's education and fertility appears to exist regardless of farm background. For couples where neither the wife nor the husband had a farm background, however, the differentials are not as large as among couples where either the wife or husband or both had a farm background. The differentials are

larger, however, by wife's education than husband's education.
To test whether the differentials are significant, a cell means model is again employed. The model is written exactly the same as shown for Equation (2) and similar constraints imposed. The results indicate that the educational differentials are statistically significant for couples with a nonfarm background as well as for couples where either or both had a farm background.7 Therefore, even
7The results of the tests for wife's education are as follows: (1) husband and wife, nonfarm background: F = 2.91, df = 3,696, p = < 0.05; (2) husband, nonfarm, and wife, farm: F = 5.41,df = 3,696, p = < 0.01; (3) husband, farm, and wife, nonfarm: F = 8.89, df = 3,696, p = < 0.01; and (4) husband and wife, farm: F = 5.71, df = 3,696 and p = <0.01. For husband's education the

when the measure of residence in the first ten years of marriage is substituted for residence at the end of the childbearing period, we do not find support for the two-generation hypothesis. Nevertheless, the argument can be made again that the differentials in fertility by education for couple having no farm experience before marriage and in the first ten years of marriage, although statistically significant, are less than for couples with a farm background. When compared with the differentials in Table 3, however, they remain, in most instances, as large.
While the focus of the hypothesis is on the diminution or disappearance of socioeconomic differentials in fertility among couples who have not had farm experience before or after marriage, the differentials by education shown in Tables 3 and 4 for couples with a farm background are also of interest. As observed in both tables, the differentials are particularly large; yet, when compared to the nonfarm couples with no farm experience, when the wife's education is eight or more years, fertility levels are quite similar. Most important, if the wife has thirteen or more years of education, couples having a farm background have somewhat lower fertility than two-generation-nonfarm couples. A possible explanation for this similar or lower fertility is that these couples in adapting to the new nonfarm environment accept more readily the norms regarding low fertility than their lesser educated counterparts. This finding
results of the tests are: (1) husband and wife, nonfarm: F = 5.90, df = 3,696, p = < 0.01; (2) husband, nonfarm, and wife, farm: F = 3.02, df = 3,696, p = < 0.05; (3) husband, farm, and wife, nonfarm: F = 7.94, df = 3,696, p = < 0.01; and (4) husband and wife, farm F= 3.98, df = 3,696,p = < 0.01.

suggests that those with a higher educational level are more likely to be integrated into the social and economic structures of the nonfarm population than those having a lower educational level.
Of interest also is the fact that this findingfor couples with an eighth grade or higher educational attainment of either the wife or husband is similar to that made by Riser (1938) based on data from surveys carried out in Columbus and Syracuse between 1930 and 1933. He found that native white couples who had moved from villages and rural areas to cities before marriage and among whom husbands had white collar or skilled blue collar occupations had fertility similar to the fertility of couples born in cities who were of the same age and occupational status.
DISCUSSION
The lack of support for the twogeneration-nonfarm hypothesis reported here for the 1901-1910 birth cohort agrees with the findings by McGirr and Hirschman (1979) for the birth cohorts of 1911-35. Thus, a number of questions arise concerning the results obtained by previous investigators in support of this hypothesis.
As noted earlier, the various studies focusing on the effects of farm background on socioeconomic fertility differentials have employed different types of samples, measures of farm background and socioeconomic status. Indeed, these differences may be a plausible explanation for the differing results in that the two-generation-urbanite hypothesis as originally proposed by Goldberg (1959,1960) was based on his findings for two urban samples, namely Detroit and Indianapolis. Thus, subsequent studies in extending the test of his

hypothesis to national samples never truly replicated his original studies. But both the Detroit and Indianapolis samples, it should be recognized, can hardly be considered representative of U.S. urban populations in the 1940's and 1950's. Although Goldberg found the strongest support for the Detroit sample, and Detroit in the 1950's was the fifth largest metropolitan area in the United States, Detroit's population was somewhat distinctive from other urban populations. In the 1940's, Detroit was the destination of a large number of migrants from the South, a high fertility area. Thus, Goldberg most likely was comparing couples who grew up in the South--many of whom had a southern farm background--with couples who not only did not have a farm background but grew up outside the South. However, he did find significant fertility differentials by wife's education for the two-generation urbanites although he did not observe them for the other socioeconomic measures he used.
A further difficulty with the Detroit study was that Goldberg aggregated the data of a relatively large number of cohorts. He employed data for currently married women 40 years and over, and his sample included women born as far back as the 1870's. Thus, he was aggregating the fertility experience of birth cohorts of 1870-1918. The completed fertility of successive cohorts from the 1870's through the cohorts of 1900-1910 was declining while the completed fertility of the cohorts born after 1910was increasing. We suspect that Goldberg's findingsfor Detroit were the result of averaging the effect of differences in the fertility of the various cohorts. This, of course, would not be a problem if the completed fertility of the cohorts being examined was approximately the same.

Further, since the farm experience and socioeconomic status of the cohorts was also changing, it is highly probable that the differential weighting of the various cohorts in the groups being examined by farm background and status were producing the attenuation of differentials being observed.
In Goldberg's study of Indianapolis, a smaller midwestern city than Detroit, the sample was constrained by the eligibility requirements of the original Indianapolis study. The sample thus included only couples who had at least an eighth-grade education, married in 1927-29, had lived most of their married life in an urban place, and who were Protestant and defined as "relatively fecund." He did not find a differential in the average fertility between couples having a farm background and the twogeneration urbanites, but he did observe fairly strong differentials for all measures of socioeconomic status among couples with a farm background but not for couples with an urban background.
The difficulties of adequately testing Goldberg's (1959) hypothesis may have been compounded by the extension of the hypothesis to nationally representative samples by Freedman and Slesinger (1961) and Duncan (1965). The nonfarm populations included in the 1955 sample employed by Freedman and Slesinger (1961) and the 1962 sample employed by Duncan without doubt were composed of a mixture of couples with varying residential histories as is true for our sample. At the time of interview, some of the couples presumably had grown up and resided in small towns located in states more rural in character than the national average while others had grown up and resided in large urban centers or metropolitan communities since birth. Moreover, there was then,

232

as there continues to be today, a high rate of migration between communities among the nonfarm population.
Although the study by Freedman and Slesinger (1961) found some support for Goldberg's (1959) hypothesis, their findings do not provide unequivocal support. They found that for couples married more than ten years there was a substantial negative association by education among couples with a nonfarm background, while for couples married less than ten years a positive relationship was observed. Thus, Freedman and Slesinger (1961) speculated that the disappearance of an inverse relationship among couples married less than ten years may indicate a transition in fertility differentials. Yet, McGirr and Hirschman (1979) come to the opposite conclusion. Since they relied on national samples of a later date than those employed by Freedman and Slesinger (1961) or Duncan (1965), they suggest that the findings of earlier studies may have been "time specific (or applicable) to only certain cohorts". They note that their data indicate a weakening of support for more recent cohorts.
Moreover, as mentioned previously, Goldberg (1959) did not find support for his hypothesis when he used education as a measure of socioeconomic status in his analysis of the Detroit sample. For the sample of Indianapolis, however, he did find that for all measures of socioeconomic status, including education, his hypothesis was supported. Nevertheless, the Indianapolis sample was greatly restricted and could hardly be considered representative of all urban populations. To some extent, therefore, Duncan's (1965) findings regarding the attentuation of educational differentials for couples with no farm background

agree with Goldberg's for the Indianapolis sample but disagree with the finding for the Detroit sample. Additionally, Duncan's (1965) finding for educational differentials do not agree with those of Freedman and Slesinger (1961).
One other major difference among the various samples should also be mentioned. As indicated in our analysis the use of currently married women as of 1950 could lead to some misclassification of the farm background of the husband because the woman's husband in 1950 did not necessarily have to be the father of her children. In 1950, the women in our sample were 40 to 49 years of age and therefore might have been widowed or divorced and had remarried by 1950. All of the samples in the other studies could also suffer from the possibility of this misclassification by focusing on currently married couples. Further, in the sample employed by Duncan (1965), the husband was the respondent. Since the questions regarding the current wife were answered by the husband, it is likely not only that the wife's fertility could be misreported since he might not be the father of her children but also that the background residence of the wife would be misclassified.
As previously noted, none of the subsequent studies, including this one, have truly replicated Goldberg's (1959) original study of Detroit. Moreover, our examination of the findings of the previous studies suggests that complete support for the hypothesis was not always found. Until we can carefully replicate other studies, definitive answers to such questions as to whether fertility differentials by socioeconomic status will disappear or have become attentuated must remain an unanswered question.
