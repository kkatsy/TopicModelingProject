This is a report on the post-insertion fertility of the more than 200,000 women who obtained an intrauterine device (IUCD) in Taiwan's family-planning program by July 1, 1966. (For a description of the program and the number of insertions over time, see Freedman and Takeshita, 1969.) I t goes beyond previous reports in (a) giving fertility experience in successive time periods after insertion, (b) providing new guidepost measures of fertility outside the program, and (c) presenting some social and demographic correlates of post-insertion fertility.
The data are from the second Taiwan follow-up survey interviews at the end of 1966 with a probability sample of 4,648 of the 206,315 women who had an IUCD insertion by July 1, 1966. A life-table technique is used to merge post-insertion histories of various lengths to estimate the proportions having a birth at successive periods after insertion. Data are presented separately for all acceptors and for the women who had terminated use of the IUCD by the time of the interview.
Terminating use of the IUCD does not necessarily mean stopping the practice of birth control. As previously reported (Freed-

man and Takeshita, 1969), 30 months or more after their IUCD insertion, 48% of the terminators had been sterilized or were using other methods of contraception; 12%, pregnant at least once after termination, aborted all their pregnancies; 26% never pregnant since first insertion presumably included many who would avoid further births. A large proportion of all the acceptors, thus could be said to be effectively practicing birth control 30 months after insertion, whether or not the original device was still in place. It is not surprising then that the post-insertion fertility of the acceptors is low.
FERTILITY IN SUCCESSIVE TIME PERIODS AFTER INSERTION
On the basis of life-table estimates (Table 1), the proportion of acceptors with a live birth rose in successive periods after insertion from 5% at 18 months to 10% at 24 months and 15% at 33 months. If we consider only the IUCD acceptors who discontinued using the device, hereafter referred to as "terminators," the proportion with a live birth rises from 11% at 18 months to 29% at 33 months. The higher rates for the terminators are expected of course, since they are less likely to be protected and a

disproportionate number of them were using the IUCD to postpone another child rather than to stop family growth. Still, as we shall presently see, the post-insertion fertility of either the terminators or all the acceptors is low in relation to their demonstrated fecundity potential.
The principal aim of the Taiwan program has been to help couples who want no more children. About 85% of the couples who have an IUCD inserted say they are doing so to stop family growth; they have all the children they want or more. One secondary aim has been to help couples who want to space their children so births do not come so quickly. It should not be surprising that couples who do not yet have all the children they want will go on to have additional children. It is a little strange that programs interested in getting more couples to usecontraception for spacing often count it as a "failure" when such couples stop contraception and have another child.
In terms of these different program goals, it is important to ask this question: What is the post-insertion fertility history of couples who say that they have had all the children they want? In Table 2, we show the postinsertion fertility history separately for the couples who still wanted more children and for those who had all they wanted or more according to statements at time of inter-

view.1 This clarifies considerably the general trends shown in Table 1.
The couples whohave had all the children they wanted were remarkably successful in keeping their fertility rates very low. Even 30 months after insertion only 8% of these couples had borne a child. This is very much less than might otherwise have been expected. On the other hand, among those who did not have all the children they wanted, 40% had borne at least one child within 30 months. Presumably, additional couples will go on to have children in the following
1 The determination of whether a woman had more children than she wanted was made bycomparing the number of children she had with the number she wanted at the time of interview and not at the time of insertion. Changes may have occurred between these two dates. For example, a woman who now reports she has all the children she wants may have had less than she wanted at the time of interview, experienced a live birth in the interval, and now is at her desired level. In this case, the live birth is not a failure of the program or of her plans. By the same token, a woman who had all the children she wanted at the time of insertion may have had a live birth and may have adjusted her desired family size to account for this.
It should also be noted that a related variable used in this analysis, whether the women accepted the IUCD for limiting or spacing purposes, was also obtained at the time of interview. In this case we are obtaining retrospectively her purpose at the time of insertion. Though both variables are obtained at the time of interview, the reference period is different for the two variables.

Korea (Potter, Freedman, and Chow, 1968). It may seem almost self-evident that a large group taking up thepractice of contraception should then have much lower fertility rates. However, there are many examples of programs in which termination rates are

high, and relatively few examples in which populations of acceptors are followed u p systematically to establish empirically what happens to their fertility. Whether fertility will be sharply reduced depends not only on the termination rate and efficiency of the

program contraception, but also on the prior and subsequent birth-control practice of the terminators.
Establishing a significant fertility decline for acceptors is not documenting a self-evident truth; it is an important step in evaluating the impact of a family-planning program. Whether the program caused the decline depends on whether the acceptors, especially those who did not use any contraception prior to the IUCD, would have taken substitute birth-control action without the program, and that is difficult to determine. However, the fact of a large post-program reduction in fertility makes the question moot.
The two distributions of expected fertility that we have used for comparison with the observed fertility are based essentially on fertility by duration of marriage for relevant populations. Chang, Liu, and Chow (1969) have tried to take additional factors into account by comparing IUCD acceptors in several townships of Taiwan with presumed nonacceptors, matched on the wife's age, education, number of living children, and number of months since last birth. In that study, the acceptors had a fertility rate 62% below that of the matched cases in the follow-up period. Of course, the pre-insertion fertility of acceptors and matched cases was about equal, by the design of the study. Their estimate of fertility reduction on quite a different basis is roughly comparable with the results in the present analysis.
CORRELATES OF POST-INSERTION FERTILITY
Post-insertion fertility understandably varies with some family life-cycle characteristics. However, it is important to stress first of all that post-insertion fertility is remarkably low for every subgrouping considered (Table 4). For example, 18 months after insertion, only 13% of the women under 25 and 8% of those 25-29 years old had borne another child. Table 4 presents cumulative fer-

tility rates for the period 18 months after insertion, both for all acceptors and then separately for those who did and those who did not want more children. The following statements are based on these data.
1. Regardless of their characteristics, those who wanted no more children had substantially fewer children than those who wanted more. This finding is not surprising, but it is far from inevitable. What is demonstrated is that those who do not want more children are highly successful in achieving their goal. The categories in which wanting or not wanting more children makes little difference are those in which the rates are very low regardless of whether more children were wanted (e.g., among couples with two or more induced abortions). One exception is the rather peculiar situation for the 100 wives who reported that they wanted no more children, but that they took the IUCD for spacing purposes! Though this may represent inconsistent reporting in part, it should be noted that the attitudes in question refer to different time periods (see note 1). The high proportion of births to this group is consistent with accepting for spacing, having a birth and then reporting, at time of interview, that no more children are desired.
2. The fertility rates are remarkably low at 18 months whether we consider all acceptors or even those who wanted more children. For example, consider women in the highly fecund age group 20-24.2 Only 13% of all acceptors (and 18% of those who wanted another child) had a baby within 18 months. We must recognize that since almost none of the women were pregnant at insertion, their real risk period for births is only 9 months. Even so, these rates are very much lower than those for the average Taiwanese married women 20-24 years old. (Compare the IUCD case rate of 13-18% with the 35% expected for all Taiwanese married women 20-24 for a 9month period in 1966.) Remember, too, that the IUCD cases are more fecund than the total population, which includes sterile women and women of low fecundability. Further, the rate for all of Taiwan includes some effects of birth-control practice also. At age 25-29, 26% of all Taiwanese married women could be expected to have a baby in 9 months as compared with the actual rate of 8% for all acceptors in 18 months (and 19% for those who wanted
2 Almost all the women shown in the 16-24 age group in the tables are 20-24 years of age.

another child). When the 18-month acceptor rates are standardized for age, there is no subcategory of any characteristic considered in which the 18-month rate approaches the rate of 18% which would be expected if all acceptors had for 9 months the marital age specific birth rates for all of Taiwan. What all of this comes to is that the IUCD acceptors, a highly fecundable group, succeeded in keeping thpir birth rates low for 18 months after the insertion, regardless of whether their initial intention was to space or limit their children.
3. Better-educated women were more likely to have had a child than the'less well-educated, because the better-educated women ·were younger and therefore much more likely to still want more children. When the educational rates are standardized for age, differences become trivial.
4. Women who had previously used induced abortion or contraception had significantly lower birth rates than others, especially among those who still wanted more children. We interpret prior use of abortion and/or contraception as evidence of strong prior motivation for birth control and some knowledge of alternatives to the IUCD.
5. It is certainly not surprising that birth rates were highest for those most dissatisfiedwith the IUCD, especially since these satisfaction statements included the responses of those who got pregnant and had a child either with an IUCD insitu or after giving up the IUCD. What is surprising is that even among those saying they were very dissatisfied only 12% had a birth.
The correlates of the 18-month birth rates
for only those women who had terminated
the IUCD are shown in Table 5 in compari-
son with rates for all acceptors. Obviously,
these rates will be higher than those for all
women, since the terminators include wom-
en who got pregnant with an IUCD in
place, or stopped to have a child, or simply
got pregnant because they failed to use an-
other method when they gave up the IUCD.
What is notable again here is that even
for the terminators, the proportions having
a live birth witnin 18 months were quite low
in every category (see Table 6). The rates
are less than the rates for all married women,
considering similar age distributions. Only
those with fewer children than they wanted
had a rate above 20%. The only other cate-

gories with over 15% were: the very young, those taking the IUCD for spacing, those without any living sons, and those who

* Indirect standardization based on the distribution of age at insertion. The age-specific proportions were applied to the age distribution in each category to yield an expected rate, E. Then the standardized rate was defined as O/B X T, where O is the observed rate for the category, E is the expected rate, and T is the overall rate for all acceptors.

terminated by expulsion. All of these are subgroups in which relatively high rates are to be expected, especially among terminators. Thehigh rate among those terminating by expulsion, which appears puzzling at first glance, may be due to the fact that expulsions are selective of younger women and and occur relatively soon after insertion, so that the period without the ITJCD is on the average greater than for other terminations.

have had a live birth within 9 months, if the women in the category followed the agespecific marital fertility pattern of all Taiwanese women in 1966. We subtracted 9 months of exposure to adjust for the fact that women arenot pregant at the time they accept an IUCD.3 However, it should be noted that this is an overly conservative adjustment for this factor.

CONCLUSION
This paper hasshown that the post-insertion fertility of women who accepted an IUCD in the family-planning program was low in relation to what might have been expected under various assumptions. Thelevel of post-insertion fertility was seen to depend, quite obviously, onwhether or not the women terminated the IUCD and, less obviously, on whether or not thewomen wanted more children. Other characteristics had an effect as well, including age, number of living sons, and prior use of contraception or abortion.
Table 7 provides a summary of our findings. In Column 1 the actual proportion of women in each group who had a live birth in 18 months is shown. In Column 2 we show the expected proportion who would

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Grants from the Ford Foundation and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development provided support for this research at the University of Michigan. Support for the work in Taiwan came in part from the Population Council. Roger C. Avery and Robert G. Potter, Jr., provided helpful comments on an earlier draft. J. Michael Coble and Caroline Lee provided valuable programming assistance; Silvia Rodriguez and Sandra Welch assisted with the computations and organization of the manuscript.
3 It should also benoted that thewomen whoaccepted an IUCD have a shorter average open birth interval (the time between last live birth and insertion) than do married women in general (as measured by the time between last live birth and interview in a cross-sectional sample). Thus, more of the acceptors are likely to be in a period of postpartum amenorrhea, although they do not constitute a large proportion of all acceptors. The average overlap of IUCD coverage with theamenorrheic period is quite small for all acceptors. Therefore, we felt that subtracting nine months of exposure from the acceptors adequately accounts for this factor as well as forthe difference in pregnancy status.
