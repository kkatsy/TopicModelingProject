In the United States, as in other industrialized countries, summary measures of the sex mortality differential, covering all ages and causes of death, have greatly increased during the twentieth century at the same time that mortality for both sexes has declined sharply. Over the period 1910-62, for example, the female-male difference in life expectancy increased from 3.6 to 6.6 years (Retherford, 1972, p. 206; Keyfitz and Flieger, 1968, p. 17). This change produced lopsidedly feminine sex ratios and high rates of widowhood at the older ages, a social problem aggravated by the fact that the aged increased greatly as a proportion of total population and continue to increase as fertility continues to decline.
The impact of smoking on the sex mortality differential has been examined by Enterline (I960), Preston (1970S and 1970c), and Retherford (1972), and its contribution to excess widowhood has been examined by Grannis (1970) and Retherford (1973). These investigations all show that the impact of smoking is substantial. The present paper examines the related problem of the effect of smoking on agespecific sex ratios. First, the trend in agespecific sex ratios is analyzed in terms of

movements of age- and sex-specific mortality rates, without reference to smoking. In the final section, overall age- and sexspecific mortality rates are split into nonsmoking and smoking components, and the analysis is extended to examine the effects of smoking.
ANALYSIS OF TRENDS IN STATIONARY POPULATION SEX RATIOS
The stationary population model provides a convenient tool for the analysis of age-specific sex ratios (Yerushalmy, 1943). A distinct advantage of stationary population sex ratios over actual ones is that the former depend only on current age-specific mortality. Unlike sex ratios in the actual population, they are unaffected by past histories of mortality, fertility, and migration. Moreover, they are the same as sex ratios in the corresponding stable population, so that they represent the long-term outcome of current mortality, regardless of future fluctuations in fertility. For these reasons, stationary population sex ratios offer an excellent avenue by which to study the long-term effects of current mortality on sex ratios at each age.
It must be pointed out, however, that although stationary and stable population

Male-female differences in agespecific mortality rates, on the other hand, decreased at the younger ages, especially in the first year of life, and increased at the older ages, as shown in the right third of Table 1. I t is apparent that the trend in sex mortality differences reflects better the trend in sex ratios than does the trend in sex mortality ratios.
The mathematics of the stationary population model is useful for analyzing more precisely the relationship between these various trends. Consider the sex ratio for an infinitesimally small age group at age x and denote it by S(x). We have that

ferences at the younger ages were more than offset by much larger increases at the older ages. These offsetting effects are analyzed in an earlier paper, in which the increase in the female-male difference in life expectancy between 1910 and 1965 is decomposed into a sum of contributions from mortality changes in each age group. This decomposition shows negative contributions at the younger ages and large offsetting positive contributions at the older ages (Retherford, 1972).
The increases at both young and old ages in male/female mortality ratios are of course quite compatible with the trends in age-specific sex ratios and male-female mortality differences. Sex mortality ratios and sex mortality differences can easily move in opposite directions if mortality for both sexes is falling (the point is easily proved algebraically, but is also illustrated numerically in Tables 1, 2, and 4), and we have seen in any case from equations (1) through (12) that age-specific sex ratios and changes in them depend directly on sex mortality differences and not at all on sex mortality ratios. Bowerman (1950) and Sowder and Bond (1956) also recognized that sex ratios could increase in a situation of falling sex mortality differences and rising sex mortality ratios at the younger ages, although neither analyzed the problem mathematically.
EFFECT OF TOBACCO SMOKING ON SEX RATIOS
Between 1910 and 1962, average annual cigarette consumption per person aged 15 and over increased considerably in the United States, from 49 cigarettes in 1910 to 3,958 in 1962. Consumption of pipe, cigar, and chewing tobacco decreased sharply over the same period, so that the increase in per capita consumption of all forms of tobacco, from 7.42 pounds in 1910 to 10.85 pounds in 1962, was much

less marked than that of cigarettes (U.S. Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1964, p. 45). Since the available evidence indicates that deaths from tobacco smoking stem mainly from cigarettes (U.S. Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1964, p. 85), the trend in cigarette consumption more accurately reflects the detrimental effects of smoking trends on health than does the trend in overall tobacco consumption.
Two important studies demonstrate that the increase in cigarette smoking has been heavily concentrated among males. In 1955 the Bureau of the Census, on behalf of the National Cancer Institute, carried out a probability sample of the United States population and found that 68.0 per cent of men but only 32.4 per cent of women had ever smoked cigarettes, and that among nonsmokers 9.8 per cent of men but only 3.1 per cent of women had previously smoked cigarettes regularly (U.S. Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1956, p. 8). A subsequent study by the American Cancer Society, which examined smoking in relation to the death rates of one million men and women over the period 195964, generally verified the National Cancer Institute findings, and in addition found that male smokers inhaled more deeply than female smokers and that they began smoking at an earlier age (Hammond, 1966, p. 128).
The concentration of the upswing of cigarette smoking and its mortality effects among males produced a substantial impact on the sex mortality differential. In the United States in 1962, the middle year of the American Cancer Society (ACS) study mentioned above, all forms of tobacco smoking combined accounted for about 47 per cent of female-male difference in life expectancy between ages 37 and 87, and about 75 per cent of the increase in the female-male difference in life expectancy

between ages 37 and 87 between 1910 and 1962 (Retherford, 1972). The related impact of cigarette smoking on the incidence of widowhood was also severe. In the hypothetical stationary population of males aged 39-88 and females 37-86 in the United States in 1962, corresponding to a couple life table of initially intact couples who never divorce or remarry after death of spouse, in turn based on average male and female mortality in the ACS sample, both the number and the proportion widowed among females would have been 21.6 per cent less if no husbands had ever smoked (Retherford, 1973). (These findings, as well as those presented below, assume that the observed differences in mortality rates for smokers and nonsmokers are almost entirely causal in nature. For discussions of this assumption, see Preston, 1970a and 19706 and Retherford, 1970, Chs. 2 and 5, and 1972.)
Since the sex mortality differential and the incidence of widowhood are both closely tied to the age pattern of sex ratios, it is clear that the trend in smoking must have had a substantial effect on sex ratios, too. Grannis (1970), who also utilized data from the ACS study, graphed male against female life table survivorship from birth to each age for different levels of cigarette consumption and found that this was indeed the case. (His results are somewhat misleading, however, because of his erroneous implicit assumption that the sex ratio at birth is one.) In this section, we further investigate this question.
The age-specific mortality rates on which the following analysis is based were derived by linearly interpolating and extrapolating mortality data given in the ACS study for age groups 37-41, . . . . , 82-86 into the standard groupings 35-39, . . . . , 80-84 and then combining these with mortality rates for ages 0, 1-4, 5-9, . . . . ,

30-34 for the United States in 1962 (Keyfitz and Flieger, 1968) to calculate life tables and corresponding age-specific stationary population sex ratios. (In the ACS study reports, the age range of mortality data was labeled 35-84 but should have been labeled 37-86, because age was tabulated as of the beginning rather than the middle of the study.) These sex ratios are treated as reasonably representative of sex ratios in the stationary population corresponding to United States mortality in 1962, and they constitute a basis, since they incorporate the ACS data, for investigating the effect of smoking on sex ratios. It is assumed that the mortality effects of smoking below age 35, the lower age limit of the ACS data, are small enough to be safely ignored.
Because of the somewhat unrepresentative nature of the ACS sample, this procedure does have some drawbacks. The ACS sample was unfortunately not a probability sample of the United States population, although efforts were made to make it as representative as possible. Data from it are used here because they constitute the only source of mortality data sufficiently detailed (specific for age, sex and smoking status) for the life table techniques employed. The health of the sample, as measured by its mortality experience, was somewhat better than that of the United States population in 1962, the middle year of the study, due to underrepresentation in the sample of nonmarried persons, hospitalized persons, and lower socioeconomic groups (Hammond, 1969). As a result, life expectancy between ages 35 and 85 was about two years higher and the female-male difference in this life expectancy about 0.5 year higher in the sample population than in the United States population in 1962 (Retherford, 1972). Table 4 shows the corresponding

discrepancy in age-specific mortality rates, and Tables 1 and 3 and Figure 2 show the discrepancy in age-specific sex ratios.
Sex ratios based on the ACS total sample are somewhat higher than those in the United States in 1962.On the other hand, comparison of the ACS sample with the National Cancer Institute 1955 probability sample of the United States population mentioned earlier shows close agreement

between the two samples in the proportion of persons who never smoked cigarettes regularly in each age-sex category (U.S. Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1956, pp. 74-75; Hammond, 1966, pp. 174176). Hence, the per cent reductions in age-specific sex ratios due to smoking, based on the ACS data and calculated below, probably represent fairly accurately the true values in the United States popu-

It is apparent that smoking has a cumulative effect on the sex ratio with increase in age.
The analysis of the previous section can be extended to elucidate quantitatively the nature of this cumulative effect. If x rep-
