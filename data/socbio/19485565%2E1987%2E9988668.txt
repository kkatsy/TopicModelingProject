Comment on Sweet and Rindfuss "Those Ubiquitous Fertility Trends: United States, 1945-1979"

Sweet and Rindfuss report on fertility have been reduced since World War II trends that "similar fluctuations were with the spread of birth control to most found within every socially defined sub- segments of the population . . . by the group that we could examine" (Sweet 1960s there was not much difference in and Rindfuss, "Those Ubiquitous Fer- completed family size by education and tility Trends: United States, 1945- hence little opportunity for dysgenic ef1979," Social Biology 30:127-139, fect from this differential" (Kirk 1969, 1983). So what were Coale (1965) and pp. 81-82). Kirk (1969) saying when they wrote that I think they were talking about the "During the long period when natality fertility rates of college-educated white was falling in the United States . . . for women. Completed fertility of U.S. most of that time or a good bit of it there white women aged 35-44 with three or was a difference by socioeconomic class more years of college education went in family size. People with higher educa- from 59per cent of completed fertility of tion, incomes, and so on had smaller the whole cohort 35-44 years of age in families. During these 130 years the 1940to 72 per cent in 1950 to 88per cent trend looked like a statistical law, but in 1960 to 89 per cent in 1970 but now that's no longer true. During the dropped to 85per cent in 1980 (U.S. Bupast 20 years or so, this situation has reau of the Census, 1945, pp. 155-156; been in the process of disappearing. Our 1955, p. 5c-66; 1964, p. 100; 1973, p. best estimate is that, quite likely, there 150; 1982, p. 49). These results do not will be a positive association between square with Sweet and Rindfuss' (1983) socioeconomic class and natality within results. I am not sure why. Maybe, it's another decade or so. This is so partly because Sweet and Rindfuss (1983) use because everybody has access now to period fertility while Coale (1965) and means of controlling family size, and Kirk (1969) were thinking about cohort even an unskilled, uneducated person fertility. They could be different but, in will be able to control it very well. So any case, the results of Sweet and Rindthat one could have come to possibly ge- fuss (1983) leave a different impression netically significant conclusions after from those of Coale and Kirk.
