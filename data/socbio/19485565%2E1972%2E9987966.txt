Are Physicians Sympathetic to Superstition? A Study of Hinoe-Uma
Kanae Kaku
Regional Medical Program of Hawaii Honolulu, Hawaii

Hinoe-Uma, or "Elder-fire-horse," is the name of a year in the ancient Japanese calendar which characterizes each year by earthly and zodiacal signs with each named year recurring in a sixty-year cycle. In Japanese mythology, the horse is symbolic of the midday and of the south, thereby suggesting brightness, heat, and strength. In the year name, it is combined with the consuming element of fire, which races like a swift red horse across the land. This ancient symbolization of the year HinoeUma has become intertwined with the tale of the tragic death of a young Japanese girl, Yaoya-Oschichi, in 1682. After fire had destroyed her home, she took refuge in a temple where she fell in love with a young page. He was not allowed to leave the temple so that Yaoya-Oshichi could not see him again once she had a new home. In desperation, she set fire to the house so that she could return to the temple. Arrested and found guilty of this crime, she was condemned to die by fire. Since she had been born in the year of Hinoe-Uma, there de-

veloped the superstition that it was a bad omen for a girl to be born in this year.
During the most recent year in which Hinoe-Uma fell, 1966, the total number of live births in Japan was 1,361,000, representing a decrease of 462,000 in number or 25.3% from the preceding year. This total is unusually small, and even smaller than 1906, the previous year of Hinoe-Uma. Nonetheless, the number of births in 1906 was the lowest in the twentieth century until 1966. The 1966 decrease in total live births compared to the trend of preceding years was a significant reduction, and the number returned to normal after this year. This decreased fertility may be attributed to the superstition of Hinoe-Uma. One imagines that parents are apprehensive of having a daughter and therefore avoid pregnancies in 1966. This paper intends to study the specific effects of superstition on births in Japan around 1966.
The materials of this study are mostly derived from Vital Statistics of Japan from 1961 to 1967 published by the Japanese

3. The sex ratio for 1967 (0.5128) decreased again very significantly (Z = 3.184). January, 1967 (0.4971), was very significantly different. The sex ratio for February through December, 1967 (0.5146) was not different (Z = 0.685).
Based on the regression trend, the drop in observed live births is statistically very significant in the year of the superstition. Knowledge-Attitude-Practice studies in 1965 and 1966 indicated a high rate of perception of the imminence of the year Elderfire-horse, a desire not to have babies in 1966--either male or female because of unpredictability of sex before birth--and a leaning to the practice of contraception (Murai, 1968). The practice must have been very effective since there was a very significant drop in births. As Azumi (1968, p. 10) has written, "Modernization, it appears, served only to provide the Japanese with more efficient ways to propitiate the same old deities."
On the other hand, there is also a very significant change in the sex ratio for the three

years, 1965-67. Although there is no reason to expect that a drop in births in 1966, due solely to limiting of births by superstitious parents, should have any effect on the sex ratio, the ratio nonetheless changes.
If there were no artifact, then based on the four-year sex ratio average for 196164 (0.5143) together with the observed male births of 1965, an estimate of the female births expected in 1965 can be calculated: observed male, 1965/(observed male, 1965 + expected female, 1965) = 0.5143. Using this equation, we find the expected female live births to be about 5,000 fewer than those actually observed in 1965 (Table 3). Similarly, this equation reveals that in 1967, there were about 5,300 more girls registered than expected. Thus, there were 10,300 girls more than expected in the "safe" years. On the other hand, there were about 10,700 fewer girls than expected in 1966, close to the same number who appeared in excess in 1965 and 1967.

number of live births indicate that there were about 10,000 more girls than expected for December, 1965, and January, 1967. For January and December of 1966, 9,100 fewer girls than expected were reported (Table 4). Therefore, almost all artifacts occurred specifically at the beginning and end of the year of superstition to the adjacent months of preceding and following years.
It appears that there was an intentional misregistration of female births away from 1966 to the adjacent "safe" years (1965 and 1967) which accounts for the significant fluctuations in the sex ratio for all three years.
In Japan, the change of date of births was a common practice. A child born at the end of a year was commonly registered as born early the next year. This was because age was counted by the year, so that a person born on December 31 became two years old the next day. This was considered especially unfavorable for girls. Another custom was to postpone the date of birth to

April 2 or after, so that a child could start school one year later and begin life advantageously according to the belief of the people.
The previous year of Hinoe-Uma was 1906 in which the number of births was 1,394,000, a decrease of 50,000 or 4% from the preceding year. It was 169,000 or 10.8% less than 1,563,000 estimated on the 190711 regression trend. The year 1906 was the time of demobilization from the RussoJapanese War; yet, the decrease of births, instead of a baby-boom, was particularly conspicuous for females and the male sex proportion soared to 0.5208, a figure not seen either before or after that year. The usual male sex proportion had been 0.5120, so in 1906 there was an unusual proportional decrease in female births. In an attempt to avoid the year of Hinoe-Uma, some superstitious parents apparently registered the daughters born in 1906 as births in the adjacent years.
In 1906, parents did not need to have medical proof of births. However, in 1966,

the physician's or midwife's birth certificate was required. Consequently, the change of date of birth needed professional cooperation. The cooperation was a rather easy procedure. A doctor or a midwife who attended a birth of a girl in 1966 could just happen to forget to fill in the date of birth on the page of certification in the maternity handbook issued by the government to every expectant mother, who is required to present this handbook on her regular obstetric checkups and for well-baby care later.
SUMMARY
The Japanese superstition about the year of Hinoe-Uma or Elder-fire-horse is that it is an unfavorable omen for girls to be born in that year. In 1966, the year of HinoeUma, live births in Japan decreased by more than 25% (462,000) from the expected regression trend. This decrease was largely the result of family planning.
About 11,000 girls were registered in excess of the expected number in 1965 or 1967. This caused very significant statistical changes of the sex ratio for these three years, being 0.5129 in 1965, 0.5184 in 1966, and 0.5129 in 1967. The normal ratio based on live births for the preceding years would have been 0.5143.
It has been observed that the annual

changes in the sex ratio were caused by changes which occurred in January and December, 1966, and the adjacent months of December, 1965, and January, 1967.
This phenomenon resulted from an intentional misregistration of female births away from the year of superstition. Since a physician's or midwife's birth certificate is required for registration, some physicians and midwives attending births of a girl in 1966 arbitrarily forgot to fill in the date of birth on the certificate. Thus, superstitious parents could avoid registering their daughters in 1966.
The same phenomenon happened sixty years ago in 1906. Will it happen again in 2026, the next year of Hinoe-Uma, or will the superstition have disappeared by the twenty-first century?
