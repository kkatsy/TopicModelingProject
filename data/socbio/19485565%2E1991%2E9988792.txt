ABSTRACT: This paper examines a number of demographic and sociocultural factors (e.g., age, marital status, family size, religion, religious assiduity, sex-role ideology) as predictors of women's attitudes toward abortion, using data from the Canadian Fertility Survey of 1984. The findings suggest that women's abortion attitudes are to a greater extent based on ideological positions. It appears that anti-abortion stance affects those women who are religious, presumably by increasing the relationship between their general sex-role ideological stances and abortion attitudes. Abortion attitudes also vary according to a woman's education, her family size, and province/region of residence.

Abortion is increasingly becoming a social and political issue in Canada. In January, 1988, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down Canada's 19-yearold abortion law, ruling it violated women's constitutional right to life, liberty, and security of person. The court effectively invited the government to introduce a new law that would be less restrictive and yet somehow balance women's rights against the competing rights of the unborn. The Supreme Court's decisions instigated antiabortion as well as pro-abortion activity.
In an attempt to resolve the abortion issue, the House of Commons passed a bill, Bill C-43, which outraged anti-abortionists because it allows abortions to be performed at any stage of pregnancy if a physician considers the woman's physical, mental, or psychological health is in danger. Bill C-43, however, was defeated in January, 1991, by an extraordinary 43-43 tied vote in the Senate, and Canada is

now left without a national abortion law. The pro-choice activists were cheered by the defeat of the law. They predicted that no federal government will try to regulate the procedure for at least the next generation. The Canadian Medical Association (CMA), which opposed the bill because it would have "recriminalized a medical act," believed the senators provided a valuable service to health care, women, and Canadian society as a whole by defeating the law. Some antiabortion activists were also pleased with the outcome because passage of the bill would have made it difficult to introduce a stronger law against abortion. They called it a victory, but insisted that Parliament must now introduce a tougher law against abortion. The years 1988 to 1991, therefore, represented a period of volatile debate on the abortion issue in Canada, and the vote in the Senate is a clear indication of how polarized and difficult the issue is.

In spite of the appreciable controversy over and interest in abortion in Canada, there has been relatively little research on the factors affecting the attitudes of Canadian women toward abortion. The more recent studies have indicated that women who are nonCatholic, educated, less religious, and metropolitan residents are more liberal in their attitudes toward abortion (Balakrishnan et al., 1988). In their study of married women living in metropolitan Toronto, Balakrishnan et al. (1972) found that religious affiliation (Catholic vs. non-Catholic) and religiosity to be more powerful predictors of attitude toward abortion. The control variables of age, education, income, and size of birthplace were not as important as the religious factors in explaining the variation in abortion attitudes. These two studies are perhaps the most conclusive studies to date on the importance of religion as a predictor of attitudes toward abortion in Canada.
Other studies indicated that both demographic and attitudinal variables are important predictors of abortion attitudes (Clayton and Tolone, 1973; Hertel et al., 1974; Renzi, 1975; Blake, 1977; Granberg, 1978; Singh and Leahy, 1978; Granberg and Granberg, 1980; Adebayo, 1988). However, few of these studies have controlled for the simultaneous effects of ideological variables. It seems likely that religious differences in abortion attitudes can be accounted for by attitudinal variables which are related to ideological stances (Barnartt and Harris, 1982). Furthermore, there is reason to suspect that the attitudinal variables affect the physical and social reasons for abortions (often known as "hard" and "soft" reasons) in the same way.

Two features central to the theoretical arguments of the present paper stand in contrast to previous studies. First, attitudinal variables such as sex role ideology are expected to be important predictors of abortion attitudes. Second, predictors of approval of abortion for physical reasons vary from that for social reasons.
This focus neither disputes nor disregards the possibility that the religious variables have direct influences on attitudes toward abortion. I suggest, however, that earlier studies may have understated the importance of attitudinal variables in explaining attitudes toward abortion by failing to distinguish their effects between physical and social reasons for approval of abortion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data used in this paper were drawn from the Canadian Fertility Survey (CFS) conducted in April-June 1984. The CFS was Canada's first national fertility survey, using telephone interviews for both household selection and in-depth interviewing of the selected respondents, namely, women in the reproductive ages of 18 to 49 years. The total of 5,315 women of all marital statuses who were interviewed constitutes a representative national sample. The overall response rate was 70 per cent.
The survey questionnaire is an outgrowth not only of the WFS questionnaire, but of other surveys done in Canada, Europe, and the United States. The CFS contained a substantial number of questions on attitudes toward marriage, family, and abortion seldom asked in fertility surveys. It also covered a wide range of topics, including pregnancy, marriage, work history, contraceptive behavior, and

socioeconomic background variables such as religion, education, income, and occupation including those of the husband where applicable. It should be borne in mind that the data were gathered before recent Supreme Court rulings which liberalized abortion laws and the Senate's tied vote against Bill C-43 which allowed abortion at any stage of pregnancy with approval of a physician.
The specific variables employed in the analyses are described below.
ABORTION
Attitudes toward abortion were tapped by seven questions. These questions were phrased as: Assuming abortion were legal, would you be for or against a woman having an abortion if . . .
1. the pregnancy is endangering the mother's life;
2. the pregnancy puts the mother's health in danger;
3. the woman had been raped; 4. there were good reasons to believe
that the child would be physically or mentally retarded; 5. the woman was not married; 6. the household does not have the financial means to support a child; and 7. the woman wants an abortion for a reason she feels is valid.
Other studies which have used the CFS data have shown clear differences in approval for abortion depending upon the reason given for abortion (see also Table 1). Approval for abortion varies from a high of 92 per cent if the mother's life is endangered by the pregnancy to a low of 32 per cent if the household does not have the financial means to support a child (see also Balakrishnan et al., 1988). Different levels of approval for abortion depending upon the reason given have also been

found by researchers in the United States (e.g., Jones and Westoff, 1973; Blake, 1977; Barnartt and Harris, 1982). The authors found greater approval for abortion for physical reasons than for social reasons. These items form a fairly consistent Guttman Scale (Balakrishnan et al., 1988), although there are two clusters of types of reasons with a gap between them. In a recent work by Balakrishnan et al. (1988) the first six items, leaving out the seventh, constituted a unidimensional scale with a coefficient of reproducibility 0.93. Ironically, factor analysis suggested the presence of two factors. Factor 1 on which the physical reasons loaded highly and positively, accounted for 46.6 per cent of the variance; Factor 2, on which the social reasons loaded highly and negatively, accounted for 20.3 per cent of the variance. Treatment of the two factors as separate scales can therefore be justified.
The four reasons for which approval is relatively high are those which were derived from physical causes, including danger to the mother's life or health, physical or mental retardation in the child, and rape. Lower levels of approval are found for abortion related to social reasons, including lack of financial means and being single. Based on these large differences in approval levels, two indices were developed, one for physical reasons and the other for social reasons. Each item was dichotomized, and the respective codes were summed. A score on the first index ranged from 0 to 4, indicating the number of physical reasons in which the women think abortions should be made legal. A score on the second index ranged from 0 to 3, indicating the number of social reasons in which the

women think abortions should be made legal. The indices measure the degree to which the women think legal abortions should be available. The two indices form the dependent variables in the study.
CONTROL VARIABLES
The independent variables selected are typical of those frequently analyzed in studies on attitudes toward abortion (Mileti and Barnett, 1972; Blake, 1973; 1977; Singh and Leahy, 1978; Balakrishnan et al., 1972; 1988; Barnartt and Harris, 1982; Powell-Griner and Trent, 1987). The variables include age (AGE), marital status (MSTATUS), number of children (CHILDREN), years of schooling (SCHOOLING), religious affiliation (RELIGION), religious assiduity (RELIGIOSITY), and occupational prestige of women (PRESTIGE). A locational variable, province (PROVINCE) is also in-

cluded as a control variable. The attitudinal variable includes sex role ideology index (SEXROLE). Items for the sex role ideology index are:
a. Do you find that it is a good thing for each partner in a couple to have their own close friends who they see without the other? (1 = Yes; 0 = No)
b. Do you find it acceptable for a woman to decide to have a child without a husband/partner in a house? (1 = Yes; 0 = No)
c. Could you make a decision to have a child without the presence of a husband/partner in the house? (1 = Yes; 0 = No)
d. Do you find it acceptable for a divorced woman to live with her children and a new partner without being married to him? (1 = Yes; 0 = No)
The respective codes for the four items
were summed up forming an index ranging from 0 to 4, measuring the number of "liberal" answers provided by each woman.

Relationship between the dependent variables and the independent variables were investigated through regression analyses. The analyses involved three steps. The first step in the analysis was to assess the explanatory power of sociodemographic and attitudinal variables on the women's attitudes toward abortion using multiple regression analyses. The second step in the analysis was to determine whether addition of religious affiliation and religious assiduity adds significantly to the explained variance in abortion attitudes beyond that accounted for by demographic factors. The third step in the analysis was to determine whether addition of the variable sex role ideology index adds significantly to the explained variance in abortion attitudes beyond that accounted for by sociodemographic (including religious factors) characteristics.
RESULTS
DESCRIPTIVE RESULTS
The descriptive data in Table 2 show no consistent relationship between approval levels of abortion and women's age. Although, age differences in approval levels, both for physical and social reasons, are not pronounced, it appears that the approval levels are comparatively higher among those aged 25-34. Means for marital status indicate that divorced/separated/widowed women are more inclined to approve legal abortion. Approval levels of abortion monotonically decrease with rising number of children, and in general, this pattern is observed within each type of reason.
Approval levels increase sharply across educational levels, and the dif-

ferences are somewhat greater for social reasons compared with physical reasons. The levels of approval by religious preference follow the expected pattern with relatively low levels of approval among Catholics. Approval of abortion varies for the remaining variables in the expected directions. Particularly, high approval levels are seen among less religious women residing in Quebec, and women who have higher occupational prestige.
MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS
Regression analyses were performed to assess the extent to which variation in approval for abortion stemmed from differences in demographic, socioeconomic (including cultural) and attitudinal variables. The results are presented in Table 3.
In general, the estimated effects of most of the variables are consistent with previous research. The strongest predictors of abortion approval include church attendance and sex role ideology for both types of reasons. When the other variables are controlled, religiosity exerts the strongest effect on abortion attitudes. In general, those who are highly educated, nonCatholic, and less religious, those with fewer children, those with more liberal sex role views, and those who reside in Quebec are more likely to support legal abortion. Religious factors explain a greater proportion of the variance for physical (9.7 per cent) and social (9.2 per cent) reasons. The relative importance of marital status is higher for physical reasons than that for social reasons, indicating that married women are more likely than their nonmarried counterparts to approve abortion for physical reasons.

some regional/provincial differences worth noting. Approval levels for physical reasons are stronger among Quebec women compared to their counterparts in Ontario. Opposition is stronger in the West than in Ontario. On the other hand, opposition to abortion for social reasons is the strongest in the Atlantic region as compared to that in Ontario.

Sex role ideology explains a greater proportion (2.5 per cent) of the variance for social reasons whereas it explains only 1.2 per cent of the variance for physical reasons, suggesting a tendency for sex role views to be more related to abortion attitudes for social reasons. Ignoring sex role ideology, demographic and socioeconomic variables explain 13.7 per cent and 17.2 per

256

cent of the variance in abortion attitudes for physical and social reasons respectively. One could now ask the question: Given the significant relationship of demographic and socioeconomic (including cultural) variables on abortion attitudes, will sex role ideology add significantly to our understanding of the abortion attitudes of women once their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are controlled? The answer is yes. Even after demographic and socioeconomic variables are controlled, sex role ideology explains a notable proportion of the variance in abortion attitudes. Apparently, demographic variables possess only a fraction of the predictive-explanatory power for attitudes toward abortion, especially, for physical reasons.
SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
The results can be summarized returning to the two basic objectives outlined in the introduction.
The first basic question was whether sex role ideology is an important predictor of abortion attitudes, when other factors are controlled. The most strongly supported notion is that approval for abortion is centered in certain strata of society that reflect a more general liberal attitude. This was suggested by the regression analysis where sex role ideology was by far the second strongest predictor for approval of abortion when other factors were controlled.
The second issue concerned whether predictors of abortion attitudes for physical reasons vary from those for social reasons. The results suggest that religiosity and sex role ide-

ology are the strongest predictors of abortion attitudes for both types of reasons. Although sex role ideology has a clear positive effect on abortion attitudes for physical reasons, this effect accounts for a relatively smaller portion of the observed variation in abortion attitudes for physical reasons. However, it contributes to a substantial portion of the variability in abortion attitudes for social reasons. This finding suggests that attitudinal variables such as sex role views are important predictors of approval of abortion for social reasons. One cannot, of course, provide more than inferential support for the impact of sex role ideology without additional data. The present analysis suggests that the impact is significant for women's attitude toward abortion, and further exploration of the impact on men's attitude might tell whether the sexes are differentially susceptible to ideological views relating to abortion attitudes.
The results also indicate that religious factors, and, especially religiosity, are more powerful predictors of attitudes toward abortion than demographic and socioeconomic variables such as marital status, education, and occupational prestige. Thus, women who are highly religious seem to be less liberal in their attitudes toward abortion.
There is an important caveat to the conclusions made here, and, indeed, to those drawn from any study that uses the CFS data to explore abortion attitudes. The questions only dealt with a limited statement. The responses do not measure whether the women themselves would get an abortion under the specific situation (Balakrishnan et al., 1988).
