ABSTRACT: Demographers often assume that interpopulation variation in birth spacing is attributable primarily to behavioral differences (e.g., in breastfeeding, coital frequency, or contraceptive practice), and that the contribution of physiological factors is negligible. This assumption may be correct, but it should be tested, especially in light of recent evidence that there may be more variation in ovarian function among human populations than was previously believed. In this paper, we apply a stochastic model of the determinants of fecundability (the monthly probability of conception) to endocrinological data collected among the Gainj, a tribal population in highland Papua New Guinea. Based on previous research, the Gainj are known to have age patterns of ovarian function that differ markedly from the Western norms. When account is taken of the late menarche, early menopause, and long ovarian cycles that appear to characterize Gainj women, mean apparent fecundabilty across the female reproductive span is reduced by about 27 per cent (from 0.316 to 0.235), and the mean waiting time to next apparent conception is increased byjust over one month. Thus, despite the fact that Gainj women differ from Western women with respect to reproductive physiology by as much as or more than any other known population, the demographic impact of these differences appears to be slight.

Classically, demographers interested in fertility differentials have focused their attention on behavioral explanations, for example, having to do with differences in contraceptive behavior, coital frequency, spousal separation, or breastfeeding practices. Undoubtedly this focus has yielded rich insights into the causes of interpopulation variation in fertility, and no one can question the overwhelming importance of such behaviors. However, reproduction is a matter of physiology as well as behavior. Despite this fact, few demographers have attempted to gauge the contribution of physiological differences to interpopulation variation in fertility.1
This absence of attention can be attributed to three factors. First, assessment of physiological differences requires tools of measurement and analysis, e.g., radioimmunoassay of bio-

logical materials, that fall outside the scope of traditional demography. Second, demographers tend to regard reproductive physiology as fixed or invariant across populations, at least net of age. This tendency amounts to a prior assumption (usually unstated) that physiological differences do not contribute in any important way to differences among populations. Certain demographers have even used interpopulation invariance as evidence that some particular aspect of fertility is determined primarily by physiology, introducing a degree of logical circularity into the argument (see, for example, Wilson et
1One of few aspects of physiology to interest demographers is the possible influence of maternal nutritional status on birth spacing (for a review, see John, 1990). In this area, however, results have been largely negative, a fact which has probably discouraged attempts to look for other physiological effects.

This view of the invariance of physiological processes would probably be rejected by most biologists, especially in light of recent evidence for tremendous genetic and physiological variation both within and among populations of virtually all species, including humans (for a review, see Hartl and Clark, 1989). Indeed, one recent text of human physiology has been structured around the theme of physiological variability (Case, 1985). With reference specifically to reproductive physiology, recent research suggests that age patterns of ovarian function (menstrual cycle length, prevalence of anovulatory cycles, luteal adequacy, etc.) may vary widely among contemporary human populations (Seaton and Riad-Fahmy, 1980; Ellison et al., 1986,1989; Johnson et al., 1987). To date, however, the implications of such variation for fertility have not been explored.
This raises the third problem: the absence of established methods for translating physiologicalfindingsinto numer-

ical predictions about demographic processes. Effects of physiology on fertility involve the ill-defined, poorly operationalized concept of "fecundity," the biological capacity to produce a live birth. Unlike fertility, which is marked by a more or less unambiguous, countable event (a live birth), fecundity is a "potential" and is thus not only unmeasurable using standard demographic techniques, but also difficult to model mathematically. Fecundity can, however, be broken down into several components, each of which can be defined precisely and, at least in principle, observed directly. Recently we have attempted to decompose fecundity into factors that are amenable to quantitative study (Table 1). We have also begun to develop mathematical models which specify the relationship of these factors to fertility itself (Wood and Weinstein, 1988; Weinstein et al., 1990a,¿>; Wood, 1989a).
One important measure of fecundity is fecundability, the probability that a couple will conceive during a month of exposure to unprotected intercourse,

differ from Western women in their age patterns of ovarian function by as much as or more than any other known human population. In particular, Gainj women experience considerably later menarche, somewhat earlier menopause, and menstrual cycles that are about 40 per cent longer on average than those of Western women (Wood et al., 1985a; Johnson et al., 1987; Wood, 198%). Thus, if interpopulation variation in these physiological components ever contributes importantly to fertility differentials, a comparison of Gainj and Western women should reveal its effects.

In May 1983,129 Gainj women ages 10 to 50 were recruited into a ten-week prospective study of ovarian function; all but 18 of these women remained in the study until its termination. The final sample of 111 women who provided complete records represents approximately 65 per cent of all females of the relevant ages from the six communities targeted in the study. Although this was an availability sample rather than a true random sample, these 111 women were known not to differ from larger samples of the general population with respect to several factors which may affect or be af-

of the study did so for reasons related to reproductive state (e.g., learning that they were pregnant). Age estimates were assigned to the subjects by the methods described by Wood et al. (1985a).
Each subject was interviewed twice weekly by a femalefieldworkerwho was well known to these women. At each interview, the subject's menstrual diary was updated (entries in the diary consisting of subject's self-report of bleeding on the day of the interview and on the two or three days since the previous interview), and a 2 ml saliva sample was collected for future studies of ovarian function using salivary steroid assays. At the end of the ten-week study period, a single 10 ml blood sample was drawn from each subject, spun down immediately, and placed in liquid nitrogen. The sera were later analyzed by radioimmunoassay for progesterone, estradiol, Iuteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, and prolactin (see Wood et al., 1985b, for assay details). These serum determinations, in addition to selfreports of lactation, permit each subject to be classified by her reproductive state

at the time of blood collection using the criteria in Table 2. The distribution of subjects by reproductive state is shown in Figure 1.

OF THE SAMPLE
Detailed analyses of these data have been presented elsewhere (Wood et al., 19856; Johnson et al., 1987; Wood, 19896); here we present brief summaries of the results.
The cumulative incidence curves of menarche and menopause were estimated from the data in the top panel of Figure 1 by inverse-variance weighted probit analysis using the maximum likelihood method of Finney (1971). According to these analyses, the estimated median ages of Gainj women at menarche and menopause are 18.4 ± 1.4 years, respectively.2 Although the esti-

In the case of menopause, the difference is not significant, but for menarche it is. We do not, however, believe that this represents a real secular decline in age at menarche, since the hormonal criteria used to classify women in the 1983 samples are more specific than those used earlier. Our earlier methods could only detect onset of full

mated median age at menarche is clearly very late by world standards, it is consistent with estimates from other parts of highland Papua New Guinea, which as a region shows the latest known ages of human sexual maturation (Malcolm, 1970; Becker, 1990; Wood, 1989&). In

In general, luteal competence followsfirstmenses by about 1.0-1.5years,consistent with the estimates from both 1978 and 1983.

contrast, while the estimated median age of Gainj women at menopause is somewhat lower than in U.S. women, it falls well within the range of values reported for other rural Third World populations (Rahman and Menken, 1990). The cumulative incidence curves of menarche and menopause in both Gainj and U.S. women are shown in Figure 2.
A survival analysis of menstrual cycle length was performed on the menstrual records of 36 of the 44 nonlactating women who appeared to be cycling at

the time of the blood draw, i.e., who showed hormonal signs of being in either the follicular or the luteal phase of an ovarian cycle (Fig. 1., bottom panel).3 To correct for the bimodal age distribution of cycling subjects (a distribution which reflects the fact that virtually all married Gainj women of midreproductive age are pregnant and/or lactating at any given time), the Gainj sample was compared with a synthetic sample of U.S. women drawn from the data of Treloar et al. (1967) and matched with the Gainj sample for gynecological age (see Johnson et al., 1987, for details). Figure 3 shows Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival functions for these two samples; the two curves are significantly different (logrank test statistic = 34.8, p < 0.0001). Estimates of median cycle length were obtained from the regression lines in Figure 3 and are given in Table 3. It appears that Gainj cycles are approximately 40 per cent longer on average than those of Western women.

cycle length is based on self-reports of menstrual bleeding, the reliability of which is inherently difficult to gauge.4 These limitations notwithstanding, it appears, based on present evidence, that Gainj women differ markedly from Western women with respect to their age patterns of ovarian physiology. In particular, Western women have one of the earliest known average ages at onset of menarche, while Gainj women have one of the latest; Gainj women also appear to have substantially longer ovarian cycles than Western women. We know of no other human populations that differ as markedly in reproductive physiology, although some populations, for example, the Efe and Lese of Zaire, show extreme differences from Western women in features such as proportion of cycles anovulatory which we have not yet evaluated among the Gainj (Ellison et al., 1986, 1989). Added to these extreme differences is a much smaller difference between Gainj and Western women in age at menopause.

There are several reasons to interpret these results with caution. Subjects' ages are not known, but rather estimated indirectly. The incidence curves for menarche and menopause are estimated entirely from cross-sectional data and thus may not represent any actual cohort if the true underlying curves have changed recently. And the analysis of
3We used a subsample of cycling women for this analysis for several reasons. First, the records of two subjects were known to be unreliable. In addition, all women who were married at the time of the study were excluded because (1) their records may have been contaminated by "silent pregnancies" associated with early fetal loss, which could have caused an apparent lengthening of their cycles, and (2) if they were exposed to the risk of conception but did not conceive during the study period, this might itself be attributable to ovarian dysfunction, so that their inclusion could have introduced selectivity bias.

What effect do these differences have on fertility? If Gainj and Western women were identical with respect to everything except their age patterns of ovarian function, how much difference in the timing of births would we expect to observe? Needless to say, this question is impossible to answer based solely on empirical observations, since the two populations differ dramatically with respect to many factors affecting fertility, including breastfeeding, contraceptive use, prevalence of induced abortion, and perhaps coital frequency. We require a mathematical model that will allow us to adjust for these other differences.
4Eventually 2we will have objective verification of the menstrual records in the form of concurrent salivary steroid profiles.

age 23 has been adjusted upward to 0.3, consistent with recent estimates based on assays of human chorionic gonadotropin (Wilcox et al., 1988).5 The rest of the curve is then allowed to vary in parallel with the curve in Figure 4. On the basis of the same studies, the time added by subclinical fetal loss has been set to 0.26 months (Wilcox et al., 1988). In accordance with Royston's (1982) analysis, the length of the fertile period is set at four days and the probability of conception from an insemination in the fertile period is set at 0.6, the average daily probability of conception over the fertile period as a whole, adjusted to the mean age of his sample.
In our model, the behavioral component of fecundability is determined by the density function of age at first marriage, which is turn affects coital frequency via its relation to marital duration. In order to hold the behavioral component constant, we set both the Gainj and Western marriage pattern equal to the curve estimated from the Gainj data (Figure 5). From this curve, the estimated mean and variance in age at first marriage (in years) are 21.6 and 8.2, respectively.
5The value 0.3 is slightly higher than the estimate of Wilcox et al. (1988), reflecting the fact that they used a somewhat conservative criterion for identifying a loss and that they missed very early losses which preceded the excretion of detectable levels of hCG in urine. Other studies have suggested substantially higher probabilities of subclinical loss, including studies based on hCG (Miller et al., 1980; Edmonds et al., 1982) and early pregnancy factor (Rolfe, 1982). It is clear, however, that early pregnancy factor entails a large number of false positive diagnoses of pregnancy, as may hCG unless an assay system is used which minimizes cross-reactivity with luteinizing hormone (Grudzinskas and Nysenbaum, 1985; Wilcox et al., 1985). We have chosen to base our estimate on the work of Wilcox et al. (1988) because their assay system is the most sensitive and specific hCG assay currently available.

RESULTS
Figure 6 compares the age pattern of fecundability in Gainj and Western women under maximal exposure when cycle length alone differs between the two populations. The 40 per cent increase in cycle length among Gainj women reduces fecundability at each age by lowering the number of fertile days expected to fall within a fixed 30day period. Since the difference in cycle length is assumed to be multiplicative so that Gainj cycles at each age are assumed to be 40 per cent longer than Western cycles, the absolute difference in fecundability is greatest at those ages characterized by long cycles, i.e., at early and late reproductive ages. This result may be an artifact of the way in which we have modeled the difference in cycle length, although not of the way in which cycle length enters into the basic model. At any rate, between ages 20 and 45, longer cycles reduce both total and apparent fecundability by about 20 per cent on average.
As might be expected, adding in the difference in age patterns of menarche and menopause has an effect only at extreme reproductive ages (Figure 7). In comparison with Western women, Gainj women now experience a period of about five years before the earliest age of menarche when fecundability is zero, and a similar period of about two years after the latest age at menopause. Postmenarcheal fecundability in the Gainj does not reach half its adult value until after age 20, that is, until about the average age at first marriage. Consistent with this finding, we have observed an unexpectedly long interval between marriage and first birth among the Gainj (Wood et al., 1985a; Wood, 1989£), an interval which is typically quite short in

most populations not using contraception. By contrast, in Western women fecundability reaches half its adult value by age 15 or earlier, well before the average age at first marriage.

Maximal exposure is, of course, an unrealistic scenario. Figure 8 therefore shows the age patterns of fecundability when marital coital frequency is determined by the age pattern of marriage

observed in the Gainj. Thé principal difference between this figure and the preceding ones is that fecundability is lower at all ages in both populations, reflecting the difference between maximal exposure and less frequent intercourse.
In all these comparisons, the fecundability ofGainj women appears to be about 20-35 per cent lower than that of

Western women at most ages. Superficially, this may seem like an important difference--and from a purely physiological point of view it may well be--but it appears to have a small demographic impact. Assuming that women ineach population are homogeneous in fecundability, then the mean waiting time to next recognizable conception issimply

the inverse of apparent fecundability (Sheps, 1964).6 Table 4 lists the predicted mean waiting items of Gainj and Western women at various ages during the reproductive span. While, on average, the apparent fecundability of Gainj women is about 27 per cent lower than that of their Western counterparts (0.235 versus 0.323), this difference translates into an increase of barely over a month in the waiting time to a recognizable conception and thus in birth intervals in general.
DISCUSSION
Our analyses suggest that the extreme physiological patterns observed in Gainj women are expected to have only a minimal effect on the distribution of birth intervals in this population. Thus, their demographic impact appears to be slight. This is not to say, however, that these patterns are not interesting in their own right from a more purely physiological point of view; indeed, we are currently carrying out studies of the hormonal and metabolic correlates of ovarian function in Gainj women. We merely suggest that, from a narrowly demographic point of view, the long cycles, late menarche, and early menopause reported for the Gainj are of minor importance. This conclusion is consistent with our earlier findings that behavioral factors such as nursing frequency and age patterns of marriage are the dominant factors limiting Gainj fertility (Wood et al., 1985a,6; Wood, 1989ft).
6If apparent fecundability varies among couples, then the mean waiting time is the inverse of the harmonic mean apparent fecundability (Wood, 1989a). In practical terms, however, heterogeneous fecundability changes the distribution of waiting times to next recognizable conception only slightly (see Weinstein et al., 1990b).

It is important to point out, however, that this comparison of Gainj and Western women is conservative, in that it is based solely on those physiological differences for which we now have direct evidence. We have ignored any possible difference in fetal loss, proportion of cycles ovulatory, and duration of adolescent and premenopausal subfecundity, deliberately setting these factors equal in both sets of women. It is thus possible that we have underestimated the total impact of physiological differences between the two groups.
This is especially true if recent findings about the relationship between age at menarche and duration of adolescent subfecundity are relevant to this comparison. It is well known that menarche is normally followed by a period during which cycles are variable in length and prone to be anovulatory (Brown et al., 1978; Billewicz et al., 1980; Metcalf and MacKenzie, 1980). In a study of 200 Finnish school girls, Apter and Vihko (1983) found a significant positive correlation between age at menarche and time from menarche until half of all cycles were ovulatory (with ovulation indicated by the presence of a midcycle LH/ FSH surge and a luteal phase rise in progesterone). Thus, girls with late menarche also experienced prolonged adolescent subfecundity. Note that this is a finding about within-population variability. If the same holds true for differences between populations, then Gainj women, with their extremely late menarche, might also be expected to have extremely long adolescent subfecundity, thus amplifying the difference between Gainj and Western women. To date, however, nothing is known about the correlation between menarcheal age and adolescent subfecundity across populations; in addition, Apter and Vihko's

results have not been replicated in other studies (e.g., MacMahon et al., 1982). Once all the saliva samples collected among the Gainj have been assayed for ovarian steroids, we should be able to address this question directly.
Another reason that the comparison presented here is conservative has to do with the quality of long cycles such as those observed among the Gainj. Our model assumes that long cycles affect fecundability only by decreasing the number of fertile days expected to fall within a single month, but that long and short cycles are otherwise functionally equivalent. It is possible, however, that long cycles may differ functionally from short cycles. For example, long cycles may actually represent multiple anovulatory cycles, may be caused by defects in follicular development, or may be associated with short or otherwise inadequate luteal phases (Lenton et al., 1984; Glass, 1986). The first of these three possibilities would have precisely the effect we have already built into our model: the ratio of fertile to nonfertile days within a month would be reduced. The second and third possibilities, however, would have additional effects on apparent fecundability. Follicular defects may result in ova that cannot be fertilized, while luteal defects may result in failure of implantation and thus an elevated risk of subclinical fetal loss (Niswender and Nett, 1988). Once again, when all the saliva samples we collected have been assayed for ovarian steroids, we will be able to assess the quality of Gainj cycles more directly.
Finally, it is important to note that our analysis is not a complete assessment of Gainj fecundability. Because of the near-impossibility of obtaining high quality prospective data on waiting times to conception in this sort of field

setting, we have not attempted to estimate Gainj fecundablity in the usual, direct manner. Rather, we have "estimated" it indirectly using a model of the determinants of fecundability, a method which requires us to take certain important factors for granted. In particular, we make assumptions about coital behavior that may not be correct in the Gainj case. While the function g(y) in Eq. (7) was fit directly to data on the Gainj, the function h (·), which describes the decline in coital frequency with marital duration, is based strictly on data pertaining to U.S. couples. While it is premature to make strong claims about the universality of this effect of marital duration on coital frequency, it does appear to be widespread (see, for example, Ruzicka and Bhatia, 1982). However, there is ethnographic evidence suggesting that coital rates may be markedly lower in highland New Guinea at all marital durations than in other parts of the world. For example, in many highland societies, including the Gainj, there are strong beliefs about the polluting or debilitating effects of sexual intercourse, requiring that intercourse occur in the forest away from house sites and gardens (Brown, 1978). Unfortunately, we do not have reliable data on coital frequency from the Gainj or from any other population in highland New Guinea, but one might predict that coital frequency in such groups is low. Until we have direct evidence about coital frequency among the Gainj, however, we will not be able to make a full assessment of Gainj fecundability, even by our indirect methods.
These limitations aside, it remains striking how little effect the known differences in reproductive physiology between Gainj and U.S. women seem to have on birth intervals. A substantial re-

auction in apparent fecundability (on the order of 25-30 per cent) translates into a trivial increase in expected birth intervals (about one month). In part, this finding simply reflects the relationship between/,, when/,,ranges between zero and one. This relationship is,of course, curvilinear, with small changes in fa inducing large changes in l//a when fa is itself small, but negligible changes when/à is intermediate orhigh. Perturbing/a when it is in the neighborhood of 0.3 or 0.4 simply produces smaller changes in the waiting time to conception (and thus in birth intervals) than equal perturbations to an fa of 0.1or lower. In addition, however, we know from sensitivity tests of our models that fecundability itself is less responsive to changes in cycle length andageat men-

arche ormenopause than it isto changes in other parameters such as thelevel of fetal loss and the proportion of anovulatory cycles (Wood and Weinstein, 1988). Thus the very factors we have left out of the comparison (or rather set equal in thetwo populations) may have the largest potential impact on fecundability. Our conclusion, that known interpopulation differences in reproductive physiology do not have important effects on birth spacing, must therefore remain provisional.
