ABSTRACT: This study investigates the unusual relationship between breastfeeding and waiting time to conception in Malaysia as reported in Goldman et al. (1987). Using data from the Malaysian World Fertility Survey (MWFS), Goldman and her colleagues (1987) find that noncontracepting Malaysian women have an unusually long waiting time to conception, given their relatively short durations of breastfeeding. This study provides a similar analysis using data from the Malaysian Family Life Survey (MFLS) and finds a more typical relationship. I conclude that the distinction between full and partial breastfeeding made to respondents of the MFLS probably led to more reliable responses to questions about breastfeeding duration, especially for women who breastfeed for long durations.

Studies of birth interval length abound in the demographic literature for good reason (Goldman et al., 1987; Palloni and Millman, 1986; Smith, 1985; Trussell et al., 1985; Knodel and Lewis, 1984; Habicht et al., 1985; John et al., 1988). The length of time between pregnancies influences not only the potential growth rate of a population (Knodel, 1977; Bongaarts, 1982), but has implications for child health as well. Longer intervals imply increased survival probabilities for children in developing countries (Hobcraft et al., 1985; Hobcraft, 1987), especially if the longer intervals are associated with intensive breastfeeding practices.1
1Separating the advantages of breastfeeding for child survival into spacing components and nutritive components is very difficult. The advantages of long subsequent birth intervals may be due largely to breastfeeding per se (Retherford et al., 1989), i.e., its nutritive and anti-infective properties, while the advantages of long previous birth intervals are probably the result of other factors, such as enabling better maternal recovery between births, and less competition among siblings (Pebley and Millman, 1986).

Breastfeeding is a primary determinant of the length of the birth interval in many developing countries (Van Ginneken, 1977; Jain and Bongaarts, 1981; Goldman et al., 1987; SimpsonHerbert and Huffman, 1981;Singh and Ferry, 1984), especially if contraceptive use is uncommon. Breastfeeding delays the return of ovulation and thus the risk of a subsequent pregnancy for a period of time that is proportional to both the length and the intensity of suckling (Jelliffe and Jelliffe, 1978). The exact degree to which breastfeeding protects a woman from pregnancy, however, is open to contention.2 While Habicht et al. (1985) find that a month of full breastfeeding delays resumption
2A panel of experts participating in the 1988 Bellagio Consensus Conference on Lactational Infertility concluded that for amenorrheic women fully breastfeeding, "breastfeeding provides more than 98% protection from pregnancy in the first six months" (Kennedy et al., 1989). For a critical assessment of this consensus statement, see Trussell and Santow, in press.

of ovulation by about a month, Jain and Bongaarts (1981) report delays in the resumption of menstruation3 of only about half that time. Indeed, Knodel and Lewis (1984) find durations of postpartum amenorrhea quite difficult to predict from breastfeeding durations.4
However, Goldman et al. (1987) in a recent study of noncontracepting women from twenty developing countries find a rather close association between median durations of breastfeeding and median waiting times to conception.5 (Fig. 1). While the overall relationship is positive, monotonie, and fairly linear, Malaysia is an obvious exception to this general pattern. Median waiting time to conception in Malaysia is 20.5 months for noncontracepting women who breastfeed. This wait is almost 8 months longer than expected, given the short median duration of breastfeeding (5.9 months) in the study population.6 Further analysis of the Malaysian data (from the Malaysian World Fertility Survey [MWFS]) by ethnic group show the Malays to be the true outliers. Malay waiting times are much longer than predicted from their duration of breastfeeding; Chinese women have
3Menstruation and ovulation do not necessarily return at the same time.
4Also, breastfeeding may provide some protection against pregnancy even after menses returns (Hobcraft and Guz, 1985; John et al., 1987).
5"Waiting time to conception" is the interval between a birth and the onset of the next pregnancy that results in a live birth.
6Goldman et al. (1987) used the following equation to predict a country's median waiting time to conception from its median breastfeeding duration: Median waiting time = (0.8 * median duration of breastfeeding) + 7.9 mo.

waiting times that are fairly close to their predicted value.7
This paper will first attempt to reproduce the measures of breastfeeding duration and waiting time to conception for Malaysia as reported in the Goldman et al. study, then compute comparable measures using data from a similar survey of Malaysian women (the Malaysian Family Life Survey [MFLS]), and finally, attempt to explain the anomalous case of Malaysia in the relationship between these two phenomena.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
MALAYSIA WORLD FERTILITY SURVEY
The MWFS was one of over forty surveys conducted in developing countries during the 1970's and early 1980's as part of the World Fertility Survey (WFS) program. The MWFS survey collected information on contraceptive use, reproductive histories, and breastfeeding behavior from 6,368 evermarried women age 49 or younger in Peninsular Malaysia during August to December 1974. The following breastfeeding information was collected for the last two births (or the last birth, if a woman only had one child): Did you breastfeed (name)? (If yes) For how many months did you breastfeed him/ her?
Goldman et al. (1987) calculated waiting time to conception by subtracting 9 months from the interbirth interval; waiting time to a current pregnancy is imputed to be the length of
7Goldman et al. (1987) compute a "residual waiting time" (compared with the predicted value) by a method of median polish. The residual waiting time is over 7 months for the Malays, but only 2 months for the Chinese.

time since the last birth, minus the estimated length of current gestation. Only breastfeeding behavior and waiting time occurring within the two years prior to the interview8 to currently married women not using contraception were included in the analysis.9
8The actual window was 27 to 3 months prior to the interview, so as to exclude recently pregnant women who may not yet know of their pregnancy.
9Thisis because the WFS collected information on breastfeeding for only the last two births. Unless a time window is specified for a short enough period of time that the vast majority of women could not have had more than two births in the window, interval estimates would be biased. For example, if a larger window (say, 5 years) had been used, the shortest intervals (which resulted in a woman having more than two births) would have been excluded (John et al., 1988).

Median waiting times and median breastfeeding durations were calculated using increment/decrement lifetables.10
In an attempt to approximate Goldman et al.'s estimate for the median duration of breastfeeding for the MWFS data, I employed decrement calculations by restricting the life table to intervals that began during the years
10Births occurring within the two-year window contribute exposure beginning at duration zero. Births occurring before the two-year window contribute exposure beginning at the duration at which they enter the window. Open intervals were censored at the time of interview for the waiting time measures; children currently breastfeeding were censored at the time of interview for the breastfeeding duration measures.

women who have an unusual relationship between breastfeeding and waiting time inthe MWFS. These dif-

ferences inreported breastfeeding durations areillustrated by the breastfeeding survivorship curves shown in Figure 2. While the Chinese curves derived from the two surveys are very close through the third quartile (lx =0.25), theMalay curves tellentirely different stories about breastfeeding during this time period.
DISCUSSION
The results elicit two questions: (1) Why do the MWFS andtheMFLS give such different measures of breastfeeding duration for Malay women? (2) Why does the MWFS survey stand out as anoutlier from the other WFS surveys?15 The answer to both questions seems to involve a problem in the interpretation ofthe breastfeeding question by MWFS respondents. While the MFLS explicitly asked about full and partial breastfeeding, and several of the other countries that conducted WFS surveys went to great lengths to ensure that thewoman understood that the interviewers were interested in any breastfeeding, theMWFS question is quite ambiguous on this point. Women
15Though both surveys suffer from a problem of respondent heaping of breastfeeding durations at intervals of 6 months, this does not seem to account for the differences in reported breastfeeding durations. The heaping index as defined by Ferry (1981) (the sum of percentages of all births (breastfed or not) weaned at durations 6, 12, 18, 24, 30,& 36 mo) for weaned children born during the time period 1972-74 is24.6% for the MFLS and 11.5% for the MWFS, which is not surprising since the MWFS births included in the analysis occurred closer tothe time of thesurvey. More recent MFLS births (197577), however, have higher median durations of breastfeeding than those born in 1972-74, and a lower heaping index than even the MWFS sample (4.0%), indicating that differential memory is unlikely to have been a major explanatory factor for the differences in breastfeeding duration reports from these two surveys.

interviewed in the MWFS were left to resolve for themselves the question of whether partial breastfeeding should be included in their reports of "months breastfeeding," and the degree to which a mix of feeding practices should count.16 That is, some Malay women may equate a change from full breastfeeding to partial breastfeeding as weaning, and others maydecide that a child who receives "most" of his/her diet from sources other than breastmilk has been effectively weaned.
This ambiguity may present less ofa problem for the Chinese respondents since Chinese durations of any breastfeeding (asmeasured in theMFLS) are much shorter than for the Malays. In fact, reported breastfeeding durations of women who wean early (by four months for the Chinese and by two months for the Malays) are quite similar for the twosurveys. It is the longer breastfeeders who appear to underreport breastfeeding durations in the MWFS. It seems that for breastfeeding durations of more than a few months, some periods of very limited breastfeeding may be excluded, unless spe-

cifically asked for as in the MFLS. If weaning is more often a distinct event for Chinese infants than it is for Malay infants, then the closer correspondence of the twosurvey curves for this group makes sense, as there would be less ambiguity about what "weaning" means for Chinese respondents. A test of this hypothesis would require more detailed histories of the relative balance between breastmilk and supplemental feeding throughout the breastfeeding period.
If Malay women do, in fact, wean their infants over an unusually long period of time, this would help explain why theMWFS would give much lower durations of breastfeeding than other WFS countries that askthe breastfeeding question in a similar manner.17 Alternatively, Malaysia maystand outas an outlier from the other WFS countries that did not distinguish between full and partial breastfeeding because of the unpopularity (relative to other WFS countries) of breastfeeding there during the early 1970's.18 Women may be more inclined to omit periods of partial breastfeeding in response to ambiguous queries about breastfeeding behavior in societies where breastfeeding is not especially popular, or
17Ferry (1981) for one, views the reported MWFS breastfeeding duration measures with skepticism.
18Malaysia had the lowest proportion of infants breastfed (74%) among the WFSsurveys included in Ferry's (1981) analysis, and the median duration of full breastfeeding in the MFLS sample is less than one month, compared to mean durations of full breastfeeding ranging from 2.2-7.9 months among the WFS countries of Singh and Ferry's (1984) study. A difference between the MFLS and the WFS surveys that distinguish between full and partial breastfeeding is that only the MFLS includes water as a supplemental food. This may be partly responsible for the very short durations of full breastfeeding reported in the MFLS.
