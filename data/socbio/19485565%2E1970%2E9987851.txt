It is well known that an appreciable proportion of recognized pregnancies end in socalled "spontaneous" or "unintentional" abortions. Actual estimates range from 4 to 20% (Freire-Maia, Guaraciaba, and QuelceSalgado, 1964; Warburton and Fraser, 1959), but tend to cluster between 8 and 12% (United Nations, 1954). I t seems reasonable to assume that the most probable frequency oí recognized abortions ingeneral populations lies roughly around 10%, the extremes of the above-mentioned range being mostly due to variables connected with the sources of data, the gestational period at which a woman is recognized pregnant, and the methodology of collecting information. In our investigations, for instance, it is impressive that among both whites and Negroes and high and low socioeconomic levels frequencies of abortions have been found at the approximate level of 10% (Freire-Maia, Freire-Maia, and QuelceSalgado, 1963; Freire-Maia, 1963a; FreireMaia and Krieger, 1963; Marçallo, FreireMaia, Azevedo, and Simoes, 1964). Since a certain proportion of embryonic deaths which occur at a very early stage escape observation, it is safe to assume that the "total" prevalence of spontaneous abortions is

somewhat larger than 10%, say around 25% or higher (Tietze, 1953).
Prospective investigations--at least as commonly performed--cannot be expected to give much better estimates than retrospective ones in this area. Since the first weeks of pregnancy still remain out of observation and the gestational age at beginning of observation varies according to a number of variables (education, economic level, race, number and outcome of previous pregnancies, etc.) comparisons between groups classified on the basis of these criteria remain difficult, and estimates of total pregnancy wastage may still be far below real rates (on the difficulties confronted in prospective investigations of fetal deaths, see, for instance, Taylor [in press]).
ABORTIONS AND CHROMOSOME ABERRATIONS
Etiological factors involved in spontaneous abortions are largely unknown; but the little we know permits saying that they form an extensive, complex, and heterogeneous array, including antigenic incompatibility, lethal genes, endocrine disorders, gynecological disturbances, accidents, and psychological traumas.
In recent years, a number of investigators

them being nonsignificant (Cox, 1964). Some investigations pooled abortions and stillbirths (Macht and Lawrence, 1955; Crow, 1955; Tanaka and Ohkura, 1958; Kitabatake, 1960,1962). Only one of them is suggestive of a radiation-induced genetic damage (Tanaka and Ohkura, 1958). It is interesting to observe that one series of data, based on a relatively small number of observations (Kitabatake, 1960, 1962), is presented not on the basis of recognized preg-

Our own data were obtained among Brazilian physicians, some of whom worked with ionizing radiation ("irradiated group") and others of whom were not professionally connected with it (control). The control data are based on 1,449 pregnancies and the

These data have been partitioned according to pregnancy order and led to the results shown in Figure 1. They show that the well-known positive parity effect on abortions is stronger in the irradiated sample. Since the accumulated doses increase with time, this is exactly what would be expected according to the radiogenetics theory. The values of i for the six
