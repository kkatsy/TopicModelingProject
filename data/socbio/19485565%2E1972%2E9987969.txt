New Information-alerting Service for High Priority Research Subjects

A new information-alerting service that provides subscribers with weekly bibliographies of the journal literature published on nearly 100 scientific and technical subjects with high research priorities has been announced by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI®). Most of the subjects covered are in the areas of environmental science, medicine, biology, and chemistry, with emphasis on the adverse effects of pollutants, food additives, pesticides, and drugs.
The new alerting service is called ASCATOPICSTM. It monitors the complete output of the 2,500 most important international scientific and technical journals. The weekly bibliographies sent to subscribers list every new article on a given subject that has a title containing words related

to the subject; or is written by people or organizations known for their work in the subject; or references the key books and papers already written on the subject. Articles are usually listed in the bibliographies within three weeks after their publication in a journal.
The cost of ASCATOPICS varies, but most subjects can be covered for $95 a year for 52 bibliographies. For researchers without convenient access to a library, tear sheets of any article listed in an ASCATOPICS bibliography are available through ISI's OATS® service.
For more information on ASCATOPICS, contact the Institute for Scientific Information, 325 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19106.

Governmental Affairs Institute Population/Family Planning Programs

Seminar-Workshops in Management and Planning of Population/Family Planning Programs: This series began in 1970 to fill the need for short-term management-oriented training for administrators of family planning programs in developing countries. Six seven-week seminar-workshops have been successfully completed with excellent response and evaluation from the participants. The next seminar-workshops are scheduled for June 19-August 4 and October 2-November 17, 1972.
The seminar-workshops introduce new ways of thinking about Population/Family Planning to help participants develop in-

sights into their individual country's problems. The workshops also encourage the interchange and examination of experience among many countries and cultures, and provide information and tools useful in program planning and management.
Seminar sessions are held at the Governmental Affairs Institute, Washington, D.C. Enrollment is limited to 25 participants. AID-sponsored participants need pay no tuition costs. For further information, contact Director, Management Services, Governmental Affairs Institute, 1776 Massachusetts Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036.

Integration of multidisciplinary diagnostic and treatment practices will be presented pertaining to total patient care. Participants will observe plastic surgery, the construction of prosthetic appliances and speech retraining procedures. Clinic and research staff will present lectures and demonstrate their data collection process re-

garding our longitudinal study program. Coordination of inter- and intradisciplinary services, parent or patient genetic counseling, and psycho-social behavior will be discussed.
Emphasis will be placed upon minimal effects to growth and development of midfacial complex through conservative surgical and dental management. For additional information and application, write to Robert T. Millard, Program Director, 24 North Lime Street, Lancaster, Pa. 17602.
