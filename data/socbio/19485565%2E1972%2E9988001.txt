Note on "How to Get Along Without Race in Demographic Analysis," by Grant Bogue

Ashley Montagu
Princeton, New Jersey

In his article "How to Get Along Without Race in Demographic Analysis" (Soc. Biol. 18:387-393), Grant Bogue attributes to me a view of "race" I have never held. I "have gone so far," he says, "as to suggest that even the very concept of race is all in our heads" (p. 388). What Bogue is referring to is the biological concept of race. This, while I have criticized, I have never denied. What I have denied is the social,

the public, concept of "race," which holds that there is a biological (genetic) relationship between "race," individual ability, and group achievement.
For all practical purposes, I consider the term "race" worse than useless--I consider it obfuscating. Bogue's confusion of the biological with the social concept of "race" constitutes yet another example of its hopeless inefficiency and imprecision.
