The secular or long-term trends toward larger body size and earlier maturation, documented for well over a century in the United States and Western Europe, are among "the most considerable phenomena of human biology at present, [with] a host of medical, educational, and sociological effects" (Tanner, 1964, p. 357). Per generation of 33 years, height has increased by roughly 1 inch (2.54 cm) and weight by 3 to 4 pounds (1.4 to 1.8 kg), while age at menarche has advanced by 1 year per generation (Tanner, 1964). Despite occasional claims that the stature increase is an artifact, due solely to earlier maturation (Morant, 1947; Huber, 1968), there is ample evidence that both trends are real (Damon, 1965; Tanner, 1968). Needless to say, the trends cannot be extrapolated backward or forward indefinitely; indeed, menarche seems to have occurred considerably earlier in antiquity and the Renaissance than during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries (Shakespeare,

1597; Tanner, 1966; Amundesen and Diers, 1969; Glick, 1969).
At present, in the general population of the United States, body size continues to increase (Stoudt et al., 1965) and menarche to occur earlier (Damon et al., 1969; Zacharias and Wurtman, 1969). However, among the well-to-do--specifically, Harvard and Wellesley students coming from private schools--height may have stabilized (Bakwin and McLaughlin, 1964; Damon, 1968). This possibility is best tested by comparing trends for successive generations within families attending private colleges, an approach which reduces both genetic and environmental variance. The environment of such families is not only more uniform than that of the population at large, but it is likely to be optimal for the time and place in respect to nutrition and health, two major determinants of the secular trends.

and 1970. The mothers' birthdates ranged from 1911 to 1931 (median, 1920); the daughters', from 1934 to 1953 (median, 1948). At each college, the Alumnae Office supplied the names of mother-daughter pairs to the Health Service, which abstracted data from individual records on file. As supplied to me, the compilations identify mother-daughter pairs only by number, to preserve confidentiality.
Although ancestry wasnot specified, previous research at Wellesley (Bakwin and McLaughlin, 1964) and my own sample (not used here) of Wellesley mothers of Radcliffe daughters indicate that virtually all subjects were white, mainly of Northwest European descent. Type of secondary school was not available for the mothers, but 169 daughters (32 per cent) had attended private schools; the rest, public schools. Examination procedures had not changed over the years at either college. Height and weight were measured with the student nude or minimally clothed, without shoes. Age at menarche was asked by a physician as part of the medical history. While recall does introduce error, if 0.5 year is added to correct for recall to the whole year the error does not distort the mean or variance of the actual age, even when recall is 17 to 19 years after the event (Livson and McNeil, 1962; Damon et al., 1969). In the present case, only 5 to 6 years had elapsed, on the average, between menarche and recall, and there is no reason to suspect systematic or differential error by mothers or daughters. Roughtly 91 per cent of histories and physical examinations were obtained on entry to college, the rest (91 Mount Holyoke mothers) later in their college careers. While this increased their age at examination (19.0 years versus 17.9 years for Wellesley mothers), height, weight, and recalled age at menarche did not differ significantly between the two colleges, for

mothers or daughters. Results for the two colleges were therefore combined.

RESULTS
Table 1 shows (1) a slight but statistically significant increase in daughters' height, (0.8 ± s.e. 0.25 cm, p < 0.01), although they averaged 0.6 years younger than their mothers when measured; (2) a similar increase in weight (0.73 ± s.e. 0.36 kg, p < 0.05); and (3) identical recalled ages at menarche, 13.1years. These standard errors for height and weight are derived from matched-pair differences, not from the standard deviation in Table 1.

DISCUSSION
The continuing increase in height contrasts with the end of that trend reported within Harvard families (Damon, 1968) and for unrelated Wellesley students (Bakwin and McLaughlin, 1964). Weight, on the other hand, had not stabilized in the present series, or the two just cited, any more than it has in the United States population as a whole (Stoudt et al., 1965). The rate of increase in height among the present families has slowed to about onethird and in weight to one-half of the intergeneration differences estimated for the general population. The health implications of continuing increase in weight, and specifically in fat (Stoudt et al., 1970), even in young adults, are well recognized.

Age at menarche has stabilized, among these women, at an age of 13.1 years, later than those reported from several recent series of wider socioeconomic range, with mean ages between 12.6 and 12.8 years (Zacharias and Wurtman, 1969). The discrepancy is unexplained, although there is evidence for population as well as individual differences in age at menarche among the well-to-do (Tanner, 1966). Maresh (1972) has reported, from a longitudinal growth study among "privileged" white girls in Denver, Colorado (1) no difference in age at menarche between 46 girls born before January 1, 1940 and 46 born thereafter; and (2) an actual (not recalled) mean age at menarche identical to that of the present subjects, 13.1 years.
Body size and age at menarche have both genetic and environmental determinants. The more uniform the environment, the larger becomes the contribution of heredity to differences among individuals and families. Mother-daughter coefficients of correlation (r) were as follows: height, 0.53; weight, 0.30; and age at menarche, 0.28. All were highly significant (p < 0.001). That for height was close to the 0.S0 expected for a trait inherited via perfectly additive genes, without dominance. If weight and age at menarche are similarly inherited, their lower r's reflect micro-environmental variation within a highly favorable macro-environment.
As for the environmental component of the secular trends, this study and others (Bakwin and McLaughlin, 1964; Damon, 1968; Maresh, 1972) indicate that in the United States the environment approached or reached an optimum one generation ago among the prosperous. Conditions are still improving among the less well-off. If the improvement continues, the end of the trends may indeed be in sight.
The situation in Europe is more complex. As regards age at menarche, Tanner (1973)

reports that school girls in Oslo and London seem to have stabilized at 13.2 and 13.0 years, respectively, whereas the age continues to fall in Holland, West Hungary, and Copenhagen.
A final question is the relationship between larger size and earlier menarche. If the determinants of both secular trends were the same, and if the individual's growth and maturation responded to them in the same way, one would expect women with earlier menarche than their mothers to be correspondingly taller, and those with later menarche to be shorter. But such was not the case. The r between "difference in menarcheal age, mother minus daughter" and "difference in height, daughter minus mother" was --0.01 ± 0.04. Complete independence was also found among 78 mother-daughter pairs of average socioeconomic status in Boston (Damon et al., 1969). These two r's, the discrepancy in the present study between the continuing increase in height and weight and the stabilization of age at menarche, and the postpubertal component of the human growth curve, all point in the same direction with respect to the secular trends: namely, physical growth and sexual maturation, though both are slowed by adverse environments, are distinct processes. Once both trends have ended, it should become easier to distinguish the determinants specific to physical growth and sexual maturation.
SUMMARY
Among 500 mothers and their 522 daughters attending Mount Holyoke and Wellesley, private women's colleges in Massachusetts, between 1930 and 1970, the daughters were very slightly taller and heavier. Ages at menarche, recalled on the average 5 to 6 years after the event, were identical (13.1 years). Trends toward larger body size and earlier menarche,

documented for well over a century and still continuing in the general population of the United States, may be coming to an end among the well-to-do, for whom body size has nearly stabilized, and age at menarche may have stabilized.
