ABSTRACT: A secondary analysis of public-health survey data collected from 298 women, age 40 or older, delivering a live-bom child in Michigan distinguished four respondent groups:those exposed to medical advice about amniocentesis and their decision about the procedure (Medically-informed Tested vs. Medically-informed Untested) and those unexposed to medical advice who reported being either aware or unaware of the procedure (Medically-uninformed Aware vs. Medically-uninformed Unaware). The two medically-informed groups differed in their estimates of risk for Down syndrome (DS), risk of test injury to the fetus, and aversion to the risk of birth defects. A regression analysis determined that perceived risk for DS due to maternal age best distinguished between the two groups. The tested women differed from the other three groups on several sociodemographic variables. The discussion draws from the Health Belief Model to identify strategies for creating a risk awareness in the target population.

The early 1970's marked a turning point in genetic counseling with the advent of amniocentesis, a recognized safe and accurate antenatal procedure for detecting chromosomal aneuploidy (uneven number of chromosomes) such as Down syndrome (NICHD, 1976). As the procedure gained acceptance in the medical community, advanced maternal age routinely became the principal indication for antenatal diagnosis (McDonough, 1978). The incidence of aneuploidic syndromes varies with maternal age. For example, the 1:284 risk of Down syndrome (DS) at age 35 sharply increases to a 1:106 risk at age 40 (Hook and Cross, 1983).
The application of this technology has not spread uniformly. Utilization rates reflect physician/patient awareness and acceptance, the availability of tech-

nical support, and financial constraints on patients and diagnostic centers (Verp and Gerbie, 1981). A CDC study in Georgia comparing amniocentesis-use ratios by racial and geographic variation revealed that test availability provided a better explanation for utilization differences than patient resistance to the procedure (Sokol et al., 1980).
The amniocentesis utilization issue stimulated this investigation which focused on linking utilization with physician advice and patient knowledge about its risks and benefits. Ultimately, patients decide whether to have the procedure and how to manage a genetically abnormal pregnancy, i.e., whether to continue or to terminate the pregnancy. An extensive literature documents the complexities and consequences of patient decisions surrounding amniocente-

A secondary analysis was conducted

This study presents a significant departure from previous studies which base their findings on a limited population, namely those patients seeking or referred for genetic counseling. Concentrating on the general population of women with advanced maternal age, this investigation seeks to assess the forty-year-old woman's knowledge of her risk for DS, her awareness of a procedure for detecting birth defects, the medical information she did or did not receive about the procedure, and the factors she considered in making a decision about the procedure.

of data collected in 1981by the Michigan Department of Public Health (MDPH) in a survey of women, age 40 or older, who delivered a live-born child in Michigan during the 1980 calendar year. Birth certificate records supplied names and addresses of these women. Excluded from the survey for reasons of sensitivity were women undergoing spontaneous abortion, women who delivered stillborns, and those releasing the child for abortion. With these exclusions, the birth certificate data yielded a list of 647 women, from a total of 701, with complete address information.

This secondary analysis of data selected from a public health department survey compares four groups of women, distinguished by their reported knowledge of and their decision about amniocentesis. The first analysis compares the two medically-informed groups that differed in their decisions about having the procedure (i.e., Medically-informed Tested vs. Medically-informed Untested). This comparison, which focuses

Each woman received a mailed packet containing a questionnaire and a cover letter explaining the study with the guarantee of subject anonymity. All materials were written at an eight-grade reading level. After one follow-up, 302 women had returned questionnaires, a response rate of 47 per cent. Four questionnaires were excluded due to respondent error, leaving 298 respondents available for this secondary analysis.

on the mothers' knowledge of their risk for DS and the risks of the procedure, concludes with a regression analysis that identifies the salient predictors of their decision. The two medically-informed groups are then compared to two groups of women who received no medical advice about the procedure and reported they were either aware or unaware of the test (i.e., Medically-uninformed Aware vs. Medically-uninformed Un-

Table 1 presents a comparison of the birth certificate and respondent data on educational attainment, race, and number of previous live-born children.

Statistical analyses included logistic and multiple regression, chi-square,and multiple comparison (Scheffe) tests.Alpha was set at the0.05 level for detecting significant effects.
RESULTS
RESPONDENT CLASSIFICATIONS
The respondents were classified by their answers to whether their physician or the physician's nurse had provided them information about amniocentesis and were divided into the two groups "Informed" or "Uninformed." TheInformed group was subsequently divided into those having amniocentesis (Informed-tested, n = 105) and those not having amniocentesis (Informeduntested, n = 143) during the first five

months of the index pregnancy. The Uninformed respondents were divided into those reporting having knowledge of the procedure (Uninformed-aware, n = 23) or no knowledge of the procedure (Uninformed-unaware, n =27).
COMPARING THE MEDICALLY-
INFORMED GROUPS
Physician Advice.--The two medically-informed groups indicated the medical advice they received from their physician and the people from whom they sought advice in helping them make their decision. Thetwogroups differed significantly in their recall of the physician's advice. Fifty-seven per cent (59) of the Informed-tested group felt that they were told to have the test; another 25per cent (26)said that they were told thetest was needed; 11percent(11) were referred to a genetics clinic; and7

per cent (8) could not remember the advice. In contrast 60 per cent (84) of the Informed-untested recalled receiving no specific advice.
The remaining 40 per cent (57) of Informed-untested reported they were given one of the three physician responses (i.e., have the test, test was needed, or referred to a genetics clinic), an indication that these women chose not to comply with their physician's advice. A comparison between these latter two categories ("advised" vs. "not advised") of respondents revealed no significant differences on the study variables and thus, were treated collectively as "Informed-untested."

Risk Assessment.--The medicallyinformed women responded to a series of questions that assessed their knowledge and attitudes about Down syndrome (DS) and the risks associated with the procedure. Respondents identified from a list the groups of pregnant women they considered "at risk" for DS (Table 2). These data are presented in descending order of risk. The first three categories are actually associated with increased risk. Based on percentage of response, both groups correctly identified the order of these risk categories. The tested group consistently attributed more risk to the categories, especially the first three.

portant criterion in their decision to have the procedure. The untested group, on the other hand, focused on the risk of the procedure to the fetus and their feelings about abortion.
Five items of this question attempted to identify concerns specific to the untested women. These items were inappropriate to ask of those taking the test, since a woman in that group may have received a positive diagnosis for aneuploidy. Three-fourths of the untested women gave first consideration to "not

wanting an abortion for any reason." About a third assumed that the fetus was normal, based in part on an uncomplicated pregnancy and no family history of birth defects.
The two groups differed in their reported insurance coverage. Seventyeight per cent (78) of the tested women reported that their insurance paid all or more than half of the cost of the procedure. Twenty-nine per cent (38) of the untested women reported this same level of coverage, but 59 per cent (76) of

this group admitted they did not know the extent of their coverage if they were to have had theprocedure.
Predicting the Amniocentesis Decision.--A multiple regression analysis was used to determine which study variables significantly correlated with the amniocentesis decision (i.e., the Informed-tested and Informed-untested groupings). This procedure is equivalent to a two-group discriminant analysis. Only the study variables reaching statistical significance in the chi-square bivariate comparisons and logistic regressions of the multiple response items were included in this analysis. The results appear in Table 7. The equation consisted of five significant predictors and accounted for63per cent ofthe variability in the two-group classification. The women's assessment oftheirriskassociated with maternal age showed the strongest effect on this decision, fol-

lowed by the physician's advice. Insurance coverage for thecost of procedure also significantly entered into this equation. The untested women showed more concern for procedurally-related injury to the fetus than the tested women, although this factor didnotattain statistical significance. Women having fewer pregnancies and smaller families and less religious objection more often elected forthe procedure.

Risk Comparisons.--Thetwo medically-uninformed groups also completed the two questions that assessed their knowledge about their risk for DS. These results appear in Tables 2,3, and 4 which include for comparison the data presented earlier on the two medicallyinformed groups. Based on their percentage ratings, the medicallyuninformed women, like the informed groups, correctly identified the "at risk" categories (Table 2). However the uninformed groups gave a higher "don't know" response, and Uninformedunaware group ascribed less risk to all the categories.

response" rate, an indication that many women had difficulty making this estimate.
Table 4 compares the four respondent groups on the maximum acceptable risk of having birth defects associated with a pregnancy before deciding to avoid the pregnancy. The Uninformedunaware group split their responses between "any or a low risk" and "it is not the person's decision," while the Uninformed-aware women responded more diversely in a pattern similar to the untested respondents. The Uninformedunaware women were the most likely of the groups to believe that couples do not have the prerogative to make a decision about becoming pregnant.
DISCUSSION
Our study sought to identify factors pertinent to the utilization of amniocentesis. Despite the target population's general awareness of the test and recognition of their maternal-age risk and the fact that the majority of the respondents received medical advice about amniocentesis, most went unscreened. Only 38 per cent (105/271) of those reported having knowledge of amniocentesis actually had the procedure. More than likely, these tested women comprise a generally well-educated, self-selected group, cognizant and concerned about their risk for birth defects, and whose decisio'n was strongly influenced by the physician.
The physician's advice plays a critical role in this decision; yet several women reported receiving no specific recommendation, an indication that many physicians in Michigan during 1980 were not routinely recommending amniocentesis for patients of advanced maternal age. These patterns certainly must

reflect the factors identified by Verp and Gerbie (1981), including physician awareness of the appropriate indications, availability of services, physician misconception about risks of the procedure, and physician resistance stemming from personal or patients' religious convictions. A significant proportion of those receiving advice chose not to have the procedure. Perhaps their previous experiences with pregnancy gave them confidence that this child was normal and that the test was unnecessary. Others found the procedure objectionable for moral reasons or weighed its benefits of reassurance against the risk of injury to the fetus. On the other hand, a significant portion of women in this survey received no information about amniocentesis from their physician, which precluded them from the prenatal screening decision. Although some knew of the procedure, many were unaware of the relationship between maternal age and the risk for DS.
The limitations in study design and response rate restrict the conclusions. Data collected retrospectively, without corroborative objective data on utilization rates and physician information, and based on recall over sensitive issues suffer error. The modest response rate and the noted racial and socioeconomic response biases limit its generalizability. It offers a limited description of responses from four groups of women occurring naturally in the target population, some of which are underrepresented.
Despite its limitations, the findings corroborate those found in the literature on patients' decisions about amniocentesis. This investigation determined that the utilization of amniocentesis rests significantly on several patient variables, with perceived risk due to maternal

Religious convictions divide women on their willingness to have the procedure, especially those who would equate it with or see abortion as its necessary consequence (Davies and Doran, 1982; Fletcher, 1981; Kolker and Burke, 1987; Rothman, 1986). The data suggest that the tested women held a more liberal religious orientation toward amniocentesis, conception, birth defects, and abortion than the other groups. These women might express more liberal views on laws permitting abortion (Seals et al., 1986). Tested women gave more realistic odds of their age-related risk for DS, influenced by their understanding of the genetics of DS and their cognizance of the consequences of having a child with DS (Ekwo et al., 1985), while women not choosing amniocentesis showed more concern about procedurally-related fetal injury and abortion (Davies and Doran, 1982; Dixson, 1981; Rothman, 1986).

A test of the Health Belief Model within the context of genetic screening for Tay-Sachs disease (Becker et al., 1975) lends support to its application here. Becker et al. (1975) found that participants in the screening program felt more susceptible to being carriers of the Tay-Sachs gene than nonparticipants, and that perceived severity affected participation levels. The match between a couple's health beliefs on the severity and susceptibility measures helped predict the likelihood of their participation in screening program. In the present study, the woman's perceptions of her susceptibility to DS, and her perceptions of having a DS child proved to be key factors in her decision about amniocentesis. The Health Belief Model suggests that the physician's recommendations, the father's advice, and information from the media would serve as cues to take health action (prenatal screen) .These action cues, coupled with

to have the procedure. Based on this model, amniocentesis would provide the benefit of reassurance to those women concerned with their risk for DS while those objecting to the procedure might attribute to themselves less personal risk for DS and perceive their religious convictions and feelings about abortion as barriers to having the test. The medically-uninformed women would remain unscreened, not from choice but from an unawareness of their susceptibility to the risks of DS.
Some researchers (Beeson and Golbus, 1985; Lippman-Hand and Fraser, 1979) argue that genetic counselors should help patients understand the consequences and burden that DS entails, rather than diverting their attention to its mathematical probabilities, as some recommend (Pauker and Pauker, 1979). Research results continue to question patients' understanding of quantitative risks (Chase et al., 1986). The present study, which demonstrated a relationship between amniocentesis use and patient knowledge and concerns about their risk, suggests that the basic issue in antenatal screening is not the counseling technique; it is making the population of women with advanced maternal age cognizant that their age places their baby at high risk for congenital abnormalities. Knowledge of the genetic risk for a pregnancy increases acceptance of amniocentesis. Knowing the exact odds of this risk may be far less im-

portant at this stage (Ekwo et al., 1985; Evers-Kiebooms and Van De Berghe, 1979), as candidates are more concerned with reducing uncertainty than knowing specific risk.
The Health Belief Model suggests that widespread media attention and physician activism directed toward educating this population of their risk and the safety of the procedure, and which clearly distinguish amniocentesis from a commitment to abortion, should prompt more women to actively seek genetic counseling. Provided that the services and copayment plans to cover the costs are available, racial and socioeconomic differences should not inhibit its utilization (Sokol et al., 1980;Marion et al., 1980). Perhaps new reproductive technologies, such as chorionic villi sampling, that detect aneuploidy within the first few weeks of pregnancy will reduce some of the problems of antenatal testing associated with amniocentesis, namely detection late in pregnancy and the long waiting period for results. Even with these new technologies, the education problem will remain. Until this hurdle is overcome, demonstrating the most effective counseling strategy for helping patients make their decision must remain a secondary issue.
