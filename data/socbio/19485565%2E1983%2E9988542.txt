ABSTRACT: Three dimensions of isolated spousal separation largely determine its fertility impact: (1) length, (2) "completeness" (degree to which it is eliminating fecundability during fecundable months), and (3) its timing as defined by the reproductive state of the wife at its start. While it is obvious that by starting when the wife is in the fecundable state its net delaying of next conception is maximized, it is much less clear with which reproductive state its start should coincide in order to minimize its fertility impact. By means of a simple model, it is shown that for minimum impact a separation should start later in a pregnancy the longer is post-partum anovulation, the higher is the level of intrauterine mortality, and the shorter is the period of separation. Conditions of natural fertility are assumed.

former are often associated withfishing or farming occupations while the latter are often linked with military service or with migration from one community to another in which the husband precedes the rest of the family.
Three dimensions of separation largely determine its fertility impact. First, and most obvious, is its length. Second, is whether the separation is "complete" or not, and therefore whether it eliminates fecundability when overlapping fecundable exposure, or merely reduces fecundability by reducing the frequency of coitus within the intermenstrum. The third dimension is its timing. Does it start when the wife is in a fecundable state, when she is pregnant, or when she is temporarily amenorrheic?
In terms of this third dimension, if the separation starts when the woman is in the fecundable state, then a complete nmonth separation should delay the next conception n months. If, on the other hand, it starts when she is pregnant or in a post-pregnancy anovulatory state, then its net fertility effect is reduced due to the overlap, partial or entire, with temporary infecundability. The manner in which the timing of cyclic spouse separation within a pregnancy interval affects the interval's length has been studied by Potter and Kobrin (1982ft).
With respect to single separations, the comparable question is: With what reproductive state should the start of spousal separation coincide, in order to minimize the expected net delay of the next conception? This question, the object of investigation of the present paper, turns out to be a complex issue, one whose answer is not wholly intuitive. Indeed, no single reproductive state such as the first month of gestation always qualifies. Instead, it is a function of the

values taken by three factors: length of separation, average length of postpartum anovulation, and the overall rate of spontaneous pregnancy wastage.
The paper is organized into the following five sections: (1) the hypotheses, (2) the model, (3).the formulas, (4) the main results, and (5) the summary and discussion.
THE HYPOTHESES
It is obvious that, under natural fertility conditions, starting separation during a fecundable month maximizes the fertility impact of a complete «-month spousal separation. It is not at all clear, however, what reproductive status would minimize the effect of such a separation. One might suppose that it would be the first month of pregnancy. This supposition would be valid only if one knew, in advance, that the pregnancy was going to lead to a live birth, thereby assuring nine-"plus" months of pregnancy and post-partum nonsusceptibility. If, on the other hand, one knows only the current length of the pregnancy and not its outcome, then the picture changes and becomes much more interesting.
If the separation starts during the fourth or fifth month of gestation, instead of the first month, one forfeits the possibility of overlap with the initial few months of pregnancy but, at the same time, one also greatly reduces the risk of pregnancy wastage, given that most recognizable miscarriages occur in the second or third gestational months. Thus, there arises the question of whether the overlap of separation and the infecundable period is maximized by starting separation with the first month of pregnancy or by starting separation in a later gestational month. In the former case, there

is the overlap of separation with the initial gestational months, but simultaneously, a much greater risk of miscarriage. There will be, therefore, a heightened proportion of women who will miscarry and therefore become susceptible relatively early in the separation period. For these women, the net delaying of the next conception is significantly greater than for the women whose pregnancies end in a live birth. In the case where separation starts later in the gestational cycle, the proportion of women who will later spontaneously abort is very much reduced, thus decreasing the number of women who will become susceptible early in the separation period. This lower number of women miscarrying is gained at the expense of forfeiting overlap with the initial months of gestational infecundability among the majority of women blessed with live births.
We see, therefore, that.the problem of maximizing the expected overlap of separation and infecundable periods, that is, minimizing the number of susceptible months the couple spends apart, is neither simple nor intuitively obvious. It is, in fact, dependent on several factors. One may argue, for example, that if the expected difference between the infecundable periods associated with a live birth and a fetal loss is large enough, then it becomes necessary to minimize the number of fetal losses, and, therefore, a mid-gestation start of separation would vouchsafe more overlap, on average, than a first month start. Then too, if the overall rate of spontaneous pregnancy wastage is higher, it will take a longer current pregnancy in order to achieve a given reduced level of subsequent fetal loss. Hence, one may plausibly hypothesize that (1) longer postpartum anovulation, and (2) a higher

overall rate of intrauterine mortality, permit a later timing of separation to minimize the net delaying of next conception.
Whether long or short separations give advantage to a later timing of the start of separation is harder to see, and, indeed, will be found later to be a function primarily of the length of postpartum anovulation.
The model for testing the above hypotheses regarding the length of postpartum anovulation and the rate of intrauterine mortality, as well as the connections with the length of separation, is described in the following section.
THE MODEL
What is necessary is an apparatus that estimates the average overlap £(0) with infecundable periods of complete separations lasting n months, among couples sharing a specified fecundability. The length of separation minus the average overlap, or n--E(0), defines the net delay of the next conception, the quantity to be minimized.1 Adequately specifying fecundity entails choosing probability distributions for the nonsusceptible periods associated with live births and
1The argument that the reproductive state at start of separation which maximizes its expected overlap with the infecundable period is also minimizing its net delaying of the next conception applies to incomplete as well as complete separation. Accordingly, exactly the same set of starting states that minimize fertility impact under specified combinations of separation length, mean duration of post-partum anovulation, and level of intrauterine mortality holds whether separation is complete or incomplete. On the other hand, expected net delays to next conception, taken as absolute values, are being reduced by any incompleteness of separation; and the formulas for these expected net delays under conditions of incomplete separation are more complicated than simply n--E(0),applicable to complete separation.

fetal losses, respectively, as well as the conditional risk, 0,-, of a later pregnancy loss, given that the current length of pregnancy is exactly i months. The level of natural fecundability turns out to be a matter of indifference since our concern is with the extent of overlap between separation and infecundable periods, not with the rapidity of conception during fecundable exposure when the couple are cohabitating. A monthly time unit is assumed throughout the analysis.
The length of the infecundable period associated with a fetal loss is represented by the truncated geometric distribution employed by Bongaarts (1977). Despite its simplicity, this distribution well captures the rapidly declining incidence of fetal wastage as gestational age increases (Leridon, 1971), the brief length of post-partum anovulation (Boyd and Holmstrom, 1972), and the limited range from two to ten months. Without serious distortion, pregnancies ending in live births are assigned a constant value of nine months.
Length of post-partum anovulation is represented by the two-parameter negative binomial distribution (Potter and Kobrin, 1981). Its advantage over the curve most commonly used, namely, the modified Pascal distribution proposed by Barrett (1969), it is the avoidance of excessive variances when the mean substantially exceeds twelve months. Both curves are most appropriate where the distribution of post-partum anovulation is unimodal as a result of either very brief breast-feeding or the absence of infant deaths. The two curves have the advantage of generating conditional monthly probabilities of resumption of ovulation that increase with the period elapsed since childbirth. This increase fits with new insights into the mecha-

nisms relating length of post-partum anovulation to lactational behavior.
The algebra of the two probability distributions for the infecundable periods as well as that for the formulas discussed below are given in the next section.
Defined as short, medium, mediumlong, and long post-partum anovulation are negative binomial distributions averaging m = 2.0,10.8,14.2, and 23.3 (in months). The latter three figures are based on amenorrhea series taken, respectively, from the Khanna Study in Punjab, India, from INCAP in Guatemala, and from Matlab, Bangladesh (Potter and Kobrin, 1981). The first, short distribution constitutes a more hypothetical curve portraying a situation of absent or very brief lactation. Together, the four distributions essentially span the observed range of post-partum anovulation length (Bongaarts, 1980, and Lesthaeghe and Page, 1980).
Defined as low and high overall risks of pregnancy wastage are 6= 0.15 and 0.30. The former is below the 0.20 to 0.25 encountered in studies especially designed to control the underreporting of second-month miscarriages (Leridon, 1977), while the latter is more typical of older women and therefore high for a simple cross-section of women.
The lengths to assign separation, n, are more arbitrary. It is desirable to have a sufficient range so that what happens for very short or very long separations becomes evident. Also useful is an intermediate length. Lengths n =6, 12, and 48 (months) are adopted for these purposes.
Since the incidence of miscarriage decreases rapidly as one passes from early to late months of pregnancy, the probability 0,, of a later fetal loss, as a function of current length /of pregnancy, also de-

Menstruation typically follows an early abortion within six weeks, meaning that any delays of menstrual onset that might be construed as temporary anovulation are of the order of two weeks. This generalization may be invalid for a late pregnancy loss, but stillbirths are only a small fraction of all spontaneous pregnancy losses. If the intrauterine deaths occurring during gestational month /, spanning exact gestational ages / - I to /, are distributed uniformly and therefore occur at an average gestational age of 1-0.5, the associated infecundable periods end on average at exact gestational age i. Hence, it is reasonable to treat those ith gestational months that include fetal losses as full months of infecundability.
This convention means that fA(i) also serves to represent the probability distribution of infecundable periods associated with fetal losses. As a result formulas (6), (7), and (8) below are greatly simplified.

its fertility impact. This bearing is significant only in relative terms when the separation is short, but becomes highly significant in absolute terms, as well, when the separation is long. Other factors being equal, the reproductive state at the start of separation that minimizes its fertility impact stands later in the infecundable period when the length of post-partum anovulation is longer, the overall risk of intrauterine mortality is higher, and the separation is shorter. Some explanations of these results have been suggested.
All these results are predicated on unimodal distributions of post-partum anovulation characteristic of either short lactation or else freedom from infant mortality. As Lesthaeghe and Page (1980) have demonstrated, however, post-partum amenorrhea is commonly bimodal owing to an initial mode of brief amenorrhea lengths associated with infant deaths followed by the principal concentration of amenorrhea lengths several months later, resulting from the lengthy lactation of mothers whose babies do survive.
To illustrate its effects, this bimodality may be crudely operationalized as a mixture of two unimodal distributions, with the minority of cases of infant mortality represented by the geometric distribution that averages 2.0 months and the majority of cases of surviving infants represented by the negative binomial distribution that averages 14.2 months. The weight attached to the former distribution, equal to the stipulated rate of in-

fant mortality, is set successively at 0.00, 0.10, and 0.20. As this rate increases, the overall mean length of anovulation decreases while the corresponding variance increases owing to rising heterogeneity. The resultant changes in the reproductive state at the start of separation that minimizes the fertility impact are seen in Table 5 by glancing down columns. The changes are modest. Furthermore, the changes occur in the anticipated direction, that is, in the direction expected from a decreasing length of post-partum anovulation, which is, in this case, a function of the increase in infant mortality.
