Symposium on Changing Patterns of Diseases Sponsored by the Society for the Study of Social Biology

A symposium on Changing Patterns of Diseases was held on Friday, May 27, 1983in conjunction with meetings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and sponsored by the Society for the Study of Social Biology, the American Public Health Association, and AAAS Section N with Sections G, K, and U as cosponsors.
In charge of arrangements for the symposium were Beatrice A. Rouse, Department of Behavioral Epidemiology, Boston University Medical Center, Boston, Mass.; Gordon Allen, Division of Biometry and Epidemiology, National Institute of Mental Health, Rockville, Md.; and Robert Murray, Jr., Division of Medical Genetics, Howard University, Washington, D.C.
The symposium presented an interdisciplinary overview of the recent significant epidemiological changes in the major diseases, explored ways they interface, and examined the commonalities in the medical, behavioral, and so-

cioeconomic factors of these changes. The following papers were pre-
sented: "The Changing Patterns of Infectious Diseases," by Walter R. Dowdle, Center for Infectious Diseases, HHS, Atlanta, Ga.; "Changing Patterns in Cardiovascular Diseases," Manning Feinleib, National Center for Health Statistics, HHS, Hyattsville, Md.; "Some Consequences of the Increasing Prevalence of Mental Disorders," Morton Kramer, Department of Mental Hygiene, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md.; and "Changing Patterns of Cancer Incidence and Mortality," Barbara S. Hulka, Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, N. C.
The goal of the symposium was to promote an informed multidisciplinary discussion of the implications of recent changes in diseases for research and for future directions in national health policy.
