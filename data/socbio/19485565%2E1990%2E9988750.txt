Individual Fertility Rate: A New Individual Fertility Measure for Small Populations

ABSTRACT: Fertility measurement in small preindustrial societies is hampered by small numbers and the lack of some essential data. Most measures of fertility are collective and require large enough populations to permit grouped data analysis. Existing individual measures of fertility are often unsatisfactory. This paper presents a new measure of individual fertility, the Individual Fertility Rate (IFR), which is constructed by dividing parity by reproductive span in years and multiplying the product by 100. The result is a number which may be used as a dependent individual or cumulative variable to study the effects of health and socioeconomic factors on fertility.

Fertility measurement in small preindustrial societies is constrained by many factors, among which are small numbers and lack of some essential data. Ages are sometimes unknown or approximate, particularly for older individuals. Large aggregates of demographic data of the type easily available in urban societies do not exist. Data for demographic analyses are collected by ethnographic techniques including household interviews and narratives (Caldwell, et al., 1988; Hull et al., 1988; Vlassoff, 1988; Das Gupta, 1988). Data thus collected in the only manner possible are often spectacularly untidy. Birth records are sometimes available, but they are not always reliable. In preliterate societies, the ethnographer must make estimates of age (Howell, 1979, p. 123). These are sometimes quite accurate if they are the result of extended observations, but even then, age groupings are often broader than are usually acceptable for demographic analysis (Chagnon et al., 1985, p. 196). The "own-child" method of fertility estimation requires assump-

tions that are not likely to be true in small populations: a moderately low proportion of "other than own" children in the household; infant and maternal mortality are insignificant; the number of children not living with their mothers is negligible; and low rates of migration during the estimation period (Rindfuss and Sweet, 1977, p. 11; Retherford and Cho, 1978, p. 568; Cho et al., 1986, pp. 6-7).
In gathering data in Peru for the purpose of studying the effects of cultural change on Shipibo Indian fertility, I found that I could make reasonably accurate age estimates of offspring and thereby calculate birth intervals for each reproductive age woman. I also found that I could ascertain, through consultations with interviewees and family members, the number of reproductive events such as live births, stillbirths, and spontaneous abortions. These data were often more ascertainable than actual ages of reproductive age women or their ages at first or later marriage.

was to correlate individual fertility with certain demographic and cultural classifications such as age, residence, and type of marriage. Part of the reason for this was to control for confounding effects on community fertility as measured by standard fertility indices such as General Fertility Rate and Total Fertility Rate. Completed Fertility was not useful since most women in the study were premenopausal. Parity alone did not convey the fertility experience of an individual woman since she may have had few or many pregnancies over a given period of time. There were no standard demographic or reproductive health indices of individual fertility which were available or suitable for my purpose (Shryok, 1976, p. 274; Spiegelman, 1968, p. 254). This paper reports the construction of a new method for measuring individual fertility, the Individual Fertility Rate.
The specific hypothesis which I wished to test in my research was whether a declining prevalence of polygyny resulted in higher individual and community fertility among the Shipibo Indians of Peru, a group which I have studied since 1964 (Hern, 1977).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Shipibo Indians of eastern Peruvian Amazon area are a riverine Panoan group with settlements along a 600kilometer portion of the Ucayali River from Atalaya to Contamana (Lathrap, 1970; Bergman, 1980). Earlier studies indicated that, in spite of the knowledge and use of herbal contraceptives, they were experiencing exceedingly high fertility (Hern, 1976, 1977). Studies done in 1964 and 1969 indicated that the Shipibo in one village experienced a General Fertility Rate of 0.305, Total Fertil-

ity Rate of 9.935, and a Gross Reproduction Rate of 4.933 (Hern, 1977). The annual Rate of Natural Increase was 4.89 per cent. The current study focused on causes of this high fertility with particular attention drawn to the declining role of polygyny in fertility control.
METHODS
Data were collected over a 14-month period in 1983 and 1984 by universal household survey of eight Shipibo Indian villages on the Ucayali and Pisqui Rivers of eastern Peru. The head of each household was interviewed to obtain basic demographic data, and a reproductive history was obtained for each female age 13years or more. Exact ages were recorded wherever possible through the use of birth registration and baptism certificates and by family reckoning where documents were not available.
In analyzing my data, I constructed three individual variables for use in data analysis. MEANINT is an arithmetic mean of birth interval lengths experienced by each woman. PROPOLY is the "proportion of polygynous birth intervals" for each woman, a value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. A woman who has been monogamously married throughout her reproductive experience would have a PROPOLY value of 0.0. A senior wife in a polygynous marriage might have a PROPOLY of 0.9 or 0.8 if she experienced term births prior to arrival of the junior wives. A junior wife is likely to have a PROPOLY of 1.0.
The formula for the specific variable constructed to measure individual fertility, the Individual Fertility Rate (IFR),
is:

The denominator, for example, is in years, because using reproductive span in months would result in extremely small products (0.03,for example) that would be distorted by a large multiplicand.

with a median of 49.1 (Figure 1). The cumulative IFR for all the women of each village was calculated and ranged from 44.80 to 63.75 (Table 1). IFR is a continuous variable, but it may be made dichotomous by computation of a secondary variable, FERTCAT, which separates those categorized as Low Fertility (IFR = 0 - 4 5 ) from those with High Fertility (IFR = 45+ ).
The arbitrary FERTCAT classification permitted, in this case, discriminant

analysis which yielded 86 members of FERTCAT = 1 and 149 members of FERTCAT = 2. The classification used resulted in correct classification of 72.1 per cent of Group 1 and 93.3 per cent of Group 2 with an overall correct classification of 85.5 per cent (Table 2).
To test further the characteristics and usefulness of the Individual Fertility Rate, I have constructed two simulated populations of 100 individuals, each with the same randomly selected repro-

In one population, the parities were drawn from a random table of numbers with a mean of 2 and standard deviation of 1 (Dixon and Massey, 1957, p. 452) in order to approximate a Western industrial population. In the other, the parities were drawn from a random table of numbers ranging from 0 to 9 (Downie and Heath, 1965, p. 316).
In the first population (Figure 2), beginning with a normally distributed mean parity of 2.0, the mean IFR for 96 valid cases was 18.595, the median was 13.001, and the standard deviation was 17.549.3 IFR values ranged from 1.154

Reproductive span actual mean was 16.568; median, 16.5; mode, 13.417; s.e., 0.772; s.d., 7.566; kurtosis, -0.905; skewness, 0.010.

In the second population (valid N = 89), with parities ranging from 0 to 9 (Figure 3), the actual mean parity was 4.225 with a median of 4.0 and standard deviation of 2.93.4 For this group, IFR values ranged from 0 to 90.756 with a mean of 26.929 and median of 24.407; standard deviation was 21.789; standard error, 2.31. '
These simulated populations show lower fertility than the real-life study population of Shipibo women, a result consistent with the high recorded community fertility among the Shipibo.

ues in thesame fashion with the Shipibo population did not seriously distort the results since so few of the Shipibo women (8 per cent) had experienced only oneterm birth.
DISCUSSION
There are several advantages to the Individual Fertility Rate as calculated here. It is independent of age andcan be used when the age of the respondent is uncertain. It is independent of age at marriage, which hasitsownset of uncertainties. It is an incidence-density-type variable since it is a function of time (Miettinen, 1976; Morgenstern et al., 1980). It reflects intensity of fertility experience since it is current and can be used meaningfully for young women who have notcompleted their reproductive careers. By contrast, Age-Specific and Mean Completed Fertility are most useful for a large population containing a significant proportion of menopausal women with certain age data.
Without exception, measures of fertility used by demographers are aggregates. Debates concerning the use of Crude Birth Rate versus Total Fertility Rate, for example, are valid and interesting, but they do not help in resolving some of the issues faced in research

with small populations (Entwisle, 1981). Aggregate measures may conceal important intragroup differences that are sources of confounding or of primary interest. In the study of rapidly changing and modernizing peasant societies,new demographic tools may be necessary to capture the details of change (Caldwell, 1982).
The IFR has similar advantages over another aggregate measure of fertility in populations with limited information, the Fertility Pattern Method (Wishik and Helbig, 1972).
In this study, IFRproved to be an extremely useful device for studying the effect of various independent variables on individual fertility.
