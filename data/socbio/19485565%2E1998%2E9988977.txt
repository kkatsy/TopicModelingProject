ABSTRACT: This study applies two methodologies to Mauritian life tables and cause-of-death data: (1) the decomposition of sex differentials in life expectancy using Arriaga's approach and (2) the estimation of the effect of marginal reduction in deaths from infectious and parasitic diseases on life expectancy using Keyfitz's methodology on cause-specific entropy and that of Nanjo. The findings in this paper support earlier findings about the importance of the period 1969-1976 in the mortality transition in Mauritius, a period in which sex differentials in life expectancies reached a peak level. The results suggest that the driving force behind those sex differentials in life expectancy was the sex differential in mortality in infectious and parasitic diseases, first among the young (ages below 10 years) and second among the older population (ages above 50 years). If the decline in mortality due to infectious and parasitic diseases was differentially greater in the older ages compared to the younger ages, that difference would have gone a long way toward reducing the magnitude of the historic peak sex differential in life expectancy achieved in 1976.

The higher mortality of males over females is not generalized, but is limited to certain causes of death. This realization prompted researchers to focus on the contribution of certain causes of death to sex differentials in mortality. In linking causes of death to age-sex differentials in mortality at a point in time, the central concern is to find out first the age groupings where the increase in sex mortality differentials have been greatest and, second, the causes of death that have been responsible.
When the study period extends over several years, so that sex differentials in mortality change over time as well as age-cause-specific death rates, the problem becomes more technical. In this paper, the study period chosen spans 17

years, from 1969 to 1986, and the focus is on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius which has experienced one of the most spectacular declines in mortality in the Third World. In four decades, from 1942^6 to 1982-84, life expectancy at birth in Mauritius increased from 32.8 to 64.38 years for males and from 33.8 to 71.23 years for females. This sharp decline in mortality was accompanied by a drastic shift in the cause-of-death structure and remarkable change in sex-differentials in mortality.
The period under study, 1969-86, marked a transitional phase in mortality decline in Mauritius. The decline in mortality was not as rapid as earlier, while the sex differential in mortality was quite substantial. The historical mortality data

of Mauritius show that it is one of the few countries where there has been a turnaround from excess female mortality between ages 1 and 40 in the period prior to 1972 to one of excess male mortality after 1972 (CSO, 1988). This change makes the period under study an interesting one with respect to sex differentials in mortality.
The group of causes of death selected for study is that of infectious and parasitic diseases. This group was among the leading causes of death in Mauritius in 1969 for both males and females. The importance of this group declined over the study period, but not in a smooth manner. The periods 1977-78 and 1982-83 marked two breaks when the death rates for infectious and parasitic diseases for males fell to much lower levels. In between these breaks, the rates were almost stationary, and prior to 1977, the rate of decline was slow.
For females, the death rates for infectious and parasitic diseases experienced very rapid decline between 1973 and 1978 which was followed by an almost constant trend in the rates over the next four years. Following that, over the period 1982-83, the death rates for infectious and parasitic diseases for females experienced another sharp decline. In general, over the period 1969 to 1986, the death rates for infectious and parasitic diseases declined by more than half for males and about three-quarters for females. Despite this decline, the group of infectious and parasitic diseases did not lose its importance in Mauritius. By 1986, deaths due to infectious and parasitic diseases comprised the second leading cause of death after deaths due to diseases of the circulatory system (Bah, 1992).

From here a faint link emerges between a specific cause of death, age patterns of mortality (and by extension, life expectancies), and sex differential in mortality. The aim of this paper is to explore this link. It is a technical study on the contribution of age-sex differentials in causes of death due to infectious and parasitic diseases to the trends in age-sex differentials in life expectancy in Mauritius.
LITERATURE REVIEW
In the mainstream demographic literature, an epic study in analyzing the contribution of cause of death to increase in sex differentials in mortality was the work by Enterline (1961). He introduced a new methodology for obtaining the contributions of causes of death to sex ratios of age-standardized death rates. He addressed this problem using data from the United States and found that between 1920 and 1960 the largest increases in sex mortality differentials occurred in the age groups 15-24 and 45-64. Enterline found that the trends in death rates for tuberculosis, maternal mortality, and motor vehicle accidents were primarily responsible for increases in the age group 15-24. On the other hand, the causes of death responsible for the increases in the 45-54 age group were certain cancers and coronary heart disease. Later on, several researchers readdressed this problem, shifting away from standardized death rates as the measure of mortality and instead giving a central place to life expectancy.
The literature provides evidence that males tend to have higher death rates than females for infectious and parasitic diseases, particularly for ages above 30. In

the case of Mauritius, a previous study has shown the importance of cause-ofdeath structure in determining age patterns of mortality. It was found that cause-of-death structure had greater influence on age patterns of mortality for males than for females. Specifically, for both males and females, the most prominent causes of death affecting age patterns of mortality were infectious and parasitic diseases and circulatory causes of death. The greatest effect of infectious and parasitic diseases on age patterns of mortality was on the young ages below 20 (Bah, 1994).
In another study, Bah and Teklu (1992) compared the age patterns of mortality in Mauritius over the same study period with those of the Coale-Demeny and United Nations model life tables. For males aged less than 10 years, a persistent pattern which emerged prior to 1978 was the similarity which the age patterns of mortality bore with the United Nations South Asian model and to some extent with the Coale-Demeny South model. However, after 1978, no one model could be singled out that showed consistent similarity with the age pattern of mortality for young Mauritian males.
The several models which showed best fit included models from both the CoaleDemeny and United Nations model life tables. For females aged less than 10, no persistent pattern emerged, whether prior to 1978 or after. For ages above 10, the age pattern of mortality for males was found to be persistently similar to that of the United Nations Far Eastern model. For females, just as in the case of young Mauritian males, different periods showed different patterns. For the period prior to 1980 no model life table could be singled out which showed a persistent fit.

For the period 1980-82, the United Nations General model showed best fit while for the period 1983-86, the South Asian model consistently showed best fit. Concerning these observations, the explanation offered was as follows:
(F)or males, marked reductions took place in the rates from infectious and parasitic diseases for ages under five over the period 1969 to 1980. It is therefore possible that it was this sharp decline in childhood mortality in Mauritius over the period 1977-1978 that made the childhood mortality pattern for Mauritian males to be no longer similar to the South Asian model (which is characterized by its high childhood mortality) (Bah and Teklu, 1992, pp. 52-53).

After Keyfitz introduced H, it has been extended by several researchers. Goldman and Lord (1986) as well as Vaupel (1986) derived an alternative expression for H. Goldman and Lord (1986) proved that H is not bounded by 1.0 as had been previously assumed by some researchers.

One convenience of Nanjo's approach is that once the coefficients have been obtained, the change in life expectancy Ae(0) can easily be obtained for different marginal age-specific reduction in cause of death. It would not be possible to do this kind of analysis using Arriaga's approach. Also, using Nanjo's coefficients, cause-specific entropy values (for ages 0 and over) can be easily obtained by the following formula:
Hi = Ae(0)/b*e(0)) = S C¡(x)/e(0)
where h(0) = 8(7) = h(5) = b(10) = ....b(85) = 8.
To mention in passing, it must be noted that an alternative computational expression for H ¡ (x) has been provided by Namboodiri and Suchindran (1987, p. 107) as follows:
(l-exp[n*(nMy¡+nMy))
This expression has not been used in this paper. Instead, Nanjo's approach has been employed.
The data used was obtained from the WHO mortality data bank. The causes of death in that data bank were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Over the period under

study, two versions of the ICD were used: the eighth revision of the ICD (ICD-8) from 1969 to 1980, and the ninth revision (ICD-9), from 1981 to 1986. The number of deaths due to infectious and parasitic diseases were grouped together for each year by age and sex. The deaths for all the causes of death were used to obtain total or overall mortality by age and sex. These data, in conjunction with population data, were used to obtain age-specific death rates as well as age-cause-specific death rates. These overall age-specific death rates served as input data into the United Nations Mortpak software to obtain life tables. These life tables were used, first as input data into a program used to apply Arriaga's methodology, and second in conjunction with age-cause-specific and overall death rates, as input data into another program to obtain age-cause-specific entropy values.
RESULTS
Tables 1 and 2 give the life expectancies at various ages for males and females respectively. For males, the period 1969-76 was a period of loss in the mortality gains that had been accrued over the previous three decades. This period witnessed reversal in mortality decline with life expectancies declining at all ages, except for life expectancy at birth. The life expectancy at birth showed a very slight rise over the period 1973-76. Recovery in health gains started after 1976 and continued till 1986. For females, there were gains in life expectancy throughout the period of study. The pace of increase in life expectancy was uniform during the 1970's and slowed down during the 1980's.
From Tables 1 and 2, the differences in life expectancies between females and

males were computed for selected ages and plotted in Figure 1. For age 0, it can be seen that females enjoyed higher life expectancies than males for all ages throughout the period of study. Over the

period 1969-76, the sex differentials were widening rapidly and reached their peak in 1976 (with the exception of ages 1, 5, and 10, and ages above 70). After 1976, the female life expectancy was decreasing

even though it was still higher than that of males. Over the period 1980-86, when males started to experience recovery in mortality decline, the sex differentials correspondingly narrowed down.
Table 3 gives the contribution of sex differential in mortality at each age group to the total sex differential in life expectancy at birth for Mauritius for selected years between 1969 and 1986.For brevity, only the percentage distributions of thetotal effects are shown (full decomposition into direct effects, indirect effects, and interaction effects available from the author upon request). From Table 3 it can be seen that for 1969 and 1973 mortality differential in age group 0-1 made the greatest contribution (about 20 per cent) to sex differentials in life expectancies, followed by mortality differential in old age groups 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, and 70-74. In 1976, the contribution of mortality differential in the age group 0-1 had dropped to about 10 per cent while those in the old age groups had risen to about 13 per cent.

In 1980,the turning point was reached. As Table 3 shows, the contribution of age group 0-1 had dropped drastically to less than 3 per cent while that of the age group 60-64 reached a peak of about 17 per cent. Over the period 1983-86 mortality in the older ages was making more significant contributions to sex differentials in life expectancy than mortality in the younger ages.
Tables 4 and 5 give Nanjo's coefficients for males and females respectively. From these two sets of coefficients, aggregated values were obtained and are shown in Table 6. The aggregated values in Table 6 form the basis for obtaining the entropy values for infectious and parasitic diseases shown in Table 7. Finally, using the aggregated coefficients, we calculated changes in life expectancy when death rates due to infectious and parasitic diseases are reduced at varying rates for different broad age groups. We show these results in Table 8.
With improvement in mortality from infectious disease, entropy values drop for

was a decreasing importance of this group of cause of death over time.
Of more interest are the results in Table 8. It can be seen that if death rates due to infectious and parasitic diseases are hypothetically reduced by 1 per cent in all age groups, life expectancy for males would increase by about 0.06 a year in 1969, declining over time to about 0.016 in 1986. The gains in life expectancy for females are comparable to those of males but are slightly higher in 1969-73 and in 1980. If the infectious disease death rate is hypothetically reduced by 2 per cent for the age group 0-9 and 1 per cent for ages above 10, the magnitude of the gains in life expectancy would increase for all years for both males and females. However, the pattern of difference between the gains in life expectancy for males and females would remain the same. It is only if the 2 per cent decline is applied to ages above 50 that the pattern would change. The results in the last panel in Table 8 shows that under such a reduction male and female gains in life expectancy would be very close except for 1976 and 1983. In other words, if the decline in mortality due to infectious and parasitic diseases was differentially greater in the older ages compared to the younger ages, that would have gone a long way toward narrowing the sex differential in life expectancy prior to 1976.
DISCUSSION
Within the wider context, the main issue addressed in this paper is the contribution of age-sex differentials in causes of death to age-sex differentials in mortality. In this study, the focus had been on infectious and parasitic diseases which played an important role in the mortality transition in Mauritius. Prior research had

shown that for Mauritian males, infectious and parasitic diseases played an important role in determining the age pattern of mortality among males for ages below 20 for the period around 1978, while for ages above 20 diseases of the circulatory system played a more important role (Bah, 1994).
There were some specific health-inhibiting factors that emerged around the period 1975-77 which need to be highlighted. It was in 1975 that cyclone Gervaise struck the island and destroyed 8,000 dwelling units. Subsequent to the arrival of this cyclone, there was an upsurge in the number of malaria cases. The magnitude of this reversal can be appreciated when considering that two years earlier, in 1973, WHO had granted Mauritius the certificate of malaria eradication (Central Statistical Office, 1988). During this period, the mortality of males rose far higher than that of females. As a result, the sex differentials in mortality in Mauritius rose from 1969, reaching a peak in 1976.
During the study period, there were hardly any gains in life expectancy among males, while for females there were gains in life expectancy throughout the period. The study has shown that it was the age group 0-1 that made the greatest contribution to sex differentials in life expectancies over the period 1969-73. In this early period, Mauritius was still largely an agrobased economy with a sugar monoculture. A boom in the economy only began in 1974. Since the population is largely South Asian in composition, the effect of some South Asian cultural traits could be seen. One such effect was the slight excess of female mortality between ages 1 and 40 (as seen from the ratio of age-specific death rates) prior to 1972 (Central Statistical

Office, 1988). For infants, these sociocultural traits did not have an effect, possibly due to the stronger influence of the health care system.
As Mauritius was experiencing rapid socioeconomic development in the late 1970's, modernizing influences worked in opposition to health-inhibiting cultural traits and resulted in a dissimilarity in age patterns of mortality between that of Mauritius and of South Asia. Over the period 1983-86, which is clearly a modern phase in the mortality pattern of Mauritius, it was mortality in the older ages that was making the more significant contribution to sex differentials in life expectancies. Perhaps the most interesting result is that the peak sex difference in life expectancy in 1976 and 1980 appears to be dueprimarily to the peak contributions from about ages 50-74 in those years.
When the contribution of deaths dueto infectious and parasitic diseases wasanalyzed using cause-specific entropy, theresults reaffirmed previous findings, namely that deaths due to infectious and parasitic diseases were no longer a serious threat

among females after 1980 while before that they were more serious for males than females. When the analysis was extended to cover the gains in life expectancy due to marginal reductions in infectious disease mortality, crucial differences appeared. A 1 per cent reduction in infectious disease mortality in all ages would give rise to higher gains in life expectancy for females than males only prior to 1980 (with the exception of 1976). After 1980, the gain in life expectancy would be higher for males than females. The effect of higher decline in the young ages relative to the other ages would be to increase the magnitude of gains in life expectancy but not to change the pattern of difference in the gains in life expectancies between males and females. The same is true for differential increase in the decline in the childhood and adult ages. However, the effect of differential increase in the decline in infectious diseases mortality in the old ages is to change both the magnitude of gains in life expectancy and the pattern of difference in the gains. If the decline in mortality dueto infectious and parasitic diseases was differentially

greater in the older ages compared to the younger ages, the peak sex differential in life expectancy reached in 1976 would have been lesser in magnitude.
CONCLUSIONS
Several findings emerge from this paper. First, methodologically, the approach of the Keyfitz/Nanjo school and that of Pollard/Arriaga are not necessarily alternative ways of analyzing age-sex differentials in life expectancy. Rather, both approaches are relevant in providing the complete picture. Arriaga's approach is more useful in assessing the contribution of age-sex differential in overall mortality to that of life expectancy. This assessment is important in the first stage of an analysis on trends in age-sex differential in life expectancy. However, when the problem addressed goes beyond assessing the contribution of differentials in mortality to differentials in life expectancies to include cause-specific effect, Arriaga's approach alone cannot suffice. There is need then to measure the effect of marginal reduction in death rates due to the specific cause of death on life expectancy. Further developments in the Keyfitz approach have made it possible for cause-specific mortality to be included in the discourse. Nanjo's approach is useful in bringing in the causespecific component and in assessing the importance of those same age groupings to sex differentials in life expectancy.
Second, the study has captured some of the changes that took place in a crucial era in the mortality transition in Mauritius. The 1970's saw the change in mortality pattern from a South Asian type to one drastically different from it. As Mauritian mortality entered a modern phase, old age mortality and mortality from noncommu-

nicable diseases played a major role in determining life expectancies. While Mauritian females suffered a health disadvantage in the past, as was the case in other South Asian populations, improvement in health of both males and females saw the reversal of this female disadvantage. Since females usually have lower death rates than males for causes of death due to infectious and parasitic diseases, the reduction in infectious and parasitic diseases, at the time when that group of causes of death was the leading cause of death, was translated into widening differentials in life expectancies. This situation, in addition to the excess male mortality that arose from the change in the cause of death structure in Mauritius, led to the peak sex differential in life expectancy in 1976. There is little likelihood that the 1976 peak in sex differential in life expectancy will be repeated again in Mauritius. As Mauritius has shed the female health-inhibiting characteristics borrowed from the South Asian cultural heritage, sex differential in life expectancy is expected to narrow, especially in the older ages.
Finally, the findings in this paper support earlier findings about the importance of the period 1969-76 in the mortality transition that Mauritius underwent--the period in which sex differentials in life expectancies reached a peak level. Whereas previous research emphasized the importance of infectious diseases on survivorship in younger ages, this research adds to that finding the importance of infectious diseases in older ages. According to the findings in this paper, the driving force behind those sex differentials in life expectancy was sex differential in mortality in infectious and parasitic diseases first among the young ages below 10 years followed by among the older ages above 50 years.
