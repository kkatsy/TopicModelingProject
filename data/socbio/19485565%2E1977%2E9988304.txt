ABSTRACT: Spatial visualization scores were obtained on the members of two hundred families. Large sex differences favoring males were found in both parents and offspring. Familial correlations, however, did not order themselves as predicted from the theory that human spatial visualization is under the control of an X-linked recessive gene. The results are compatible with a sex limitation and/or socialization theory of ability acquisition.

Human spatial ability has long been of X-linked recessive gene, and this hypoth-

Spatial ability is also more highly correlated with success in a number of technical, vocational, and occupational domains than is verbal ability or intelligence (Bennett, et al., 1974; Ghiselli, 1973; Smith, 1964), making it an important variable in applied psychology. Recent work in hemispheric specialization suggests: (a) that the right hemisphere is specialized for spatial processing and (6) that boys have greater

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Our sample consisted of 200 families with 801 individuals nearly evenly distributed between males (N = 396) and females (2V = 405). Subjects were University of Minnesota undergraduate students and their family members. Incentive for student participation included experience in test administration and four experimental points which were added to their final course grade. This is the typical recruitment procedure at Minnesota. The students were administered the Mental Rotation Test (Vandenberg, 1975) and the Hidden Patterns Test. Only data on the Mental Rotation Test are reported in this paper. Each student was then trained to administer the two tests, given a set of written instructions, a demographic questionnaire, and asked to administer both tests and the questionnaire to all members of his or her family between the ages of 11 and 69. Only data on full sibs and biologically related parents and offspring, as determined from parental reports, are reported in this paper. One week was allowed for the return of the data. Ninetysix per cent of the students returned usable data.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Descriptive statistics on the sample by sex and generation for age and test score

are given in Table 1. On the Mental Rotation Test there was a significant sex difference (p < 0.001) within each generation. Generational differences were also significant (p < 0.001) for each sex. There were no significant differences among the four groups in mean number of Mental Rotation Test items completed. Examination of male and female score distributions showed that only 20 per cent of all females scored above the male median. Our data therefore demonstrate the typical sex difference that the X-linked recessive gene theory purports to explain. Spatial ability shows a marked age and/or cohort effect as indicated in Table 1. Following DeFries et al. (1976) and Park et al. (in press) we used a Z-score banding technique to remove the effects of age. Raw test scores were grouped into five-year intervals by sex and expressed as Z-scores. Our correlations are intraclass correlations based on these Z-scores.
The age-corrected intrafamilial correlations of spatial test scores from six previous studies and the current study are shown in Table 2. The weighted average of the first three studies of parent-offspring and Yen's sib study support the X-linked theory as previously indicated. The results of the three new parent-offspring studies all fail to conform to the expected pattern. None of our parent-offspring correlations differ significantly from each other, and

therefore do not conform to the expected pattern. The difference between the brother-brother correlation and the sister-sister correlation is highly significant (p < 0.00S) in the direction opposite that predicted by the theory.
Our results taken in conjunction with those of DeFries et al. (1976) and Park et al. (in press) refute the X-linkage recessive gene hypothesis and suggest that the search for the cause of mean differences in spatial ability for the two sexes be directed elsewhere. An alternative to the X-linked hypothesis is that--analogous to height-- sex limitation occurs. Sex limitation will produce sexual dimorphism in the quantitative distribution of a polygenically controlled trait. Petersen (1976) has demonstrated that androgenicity is related to spatial ability, and Waber (1976) found

spatial ability related to maturation rate. On the environmental side, our sib correlations are compatible with a theory which argues that boys in a family tend to be pushed into activities that foster spatial ability (sports and mechanical activities) while girls are not as consistently channeled into such activities (Sherman, 1967).
